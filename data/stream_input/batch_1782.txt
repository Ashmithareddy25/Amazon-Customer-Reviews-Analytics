B0077ZNCE2|4.0|My husband and I are big fans of this series and this one was very good!!!! Can't wait for the final chapter!!!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Fantastic book, great ending and would recommend this set to anyone, cant wait for the next movies!! please hurry it
B009VB7QQA|3.0|I received an hour and a half to two hours of entertainment. I'm not too disappointed since this was a rental and not a purchase.  If you liked Priest or Jonah Hex, you might like this one.
B0074V33MK|5.0|This was a great book by a survivor of the Burma-Thailand Railway, and takes the reader through the author's eyes through his early life and induction into the military trough his experiences in the war and then his struggle to return to his life and to find peace. The early part is sort of detailed, but it sets the background well for what happens to this soldier in his time and confinement in the prisons of the Japanese. The best part of the book is the final portion where he finds peace and journeys back to Thailand to face his past and a Japanese who he held with much anger. Certainly a different aspect of the Death Railway story, and thought provoking about our human relationships.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|As long as you understand this movie is NOT an Alien prequel, nor does it have anything directly to do with Alien(s) you will be fine.  I personally know six people that did not enjoy this movie.  They all thought this would be about the original Xenomorph.  The atmosphere and pacing were similar to the original Alien (both are directed by Ridley Scott.)  Great Sci-Fi.  The first movie in a planned trilogy.
B009FXIICK|5.0|This used to be my favorite hotmail game.<br />I'm so glad that I can play this game in my PHONE!!<br />I wish you can compete with other players to make it more fun and interesting :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is finally here, pinterest for the kindle fire. Many third parties have tried to develop their own pinterest apps, but all seem to fall short in one way or another. This app is legit, providing users with all of the functionality they expect from their notebook/desktop, but in a compact and efficient mobile format. FINALLY! well done.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love this game! This game does not take too much time to play. I wish I could play more often, but it takes forever to restore the energy. ALso, one thing I don't like about this game is it's very hard to get items...
1616960922|5.0|This was a totally awesome book and beautifully written. I ended up loveing the author for writing it.<br />The characters in the book were strong and beautiful. The descriptions of things, places and people so clear that they were part of my dreams while reading ths book.<br />thank you.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|Stones is the Stones - Great begining to current (refuse to say end) of their music.<br />The older cuts still have their odd tuning aspects (more than likely caused in the studio slowing or filling tape speed to fill a specific amount of time) - Other than that good collection.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Very very very FUNNY. The film was great from start to finish. I Would recommend to everyone. If you like Johnny Depp you will love this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is great if u r going to get pe u have to get full its very amazon the possabilities are endless u can do anything buy!!!!!!!! there r a lot of things like Pc.
B007SGM084|5.0|I know you hear a lot of people say its crappy writing and a bunch of other reasons why the books suck. But.....no one is really reading for the &#34;literature&#34; to be honest. Bought the kindle version, it reads perfectly
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|This record surpasses all other zz tops efforts, Beer drinkers and hell raisers, as well as La grange, and Jesus just left Chicago are just some of the tracks you will enjoy on this one
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is the best Pixar movie since the Incredibles. From the beautiful lush Scottish scenery, to the funny, heartfelt story, Brave hits it's mark time and time again.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This little app is absolutely the best, it give one alot of options to take advantage of... It's a steal for the going price and the options it affords you... It's a must have for your smart device...
034580404X|5.0|What more needs to be said?  I was a tad disappointed in how it all ended up, but there was a good deal of hot romance, with some mystery and danger as a sidekick...
B006OAB3ME|5.0|The best thing about this purchase, like all CD's is the availability that requires only a little patience and planning.
0425263908|4.0|That said, the story line seems reminiscent of the Grey series, but it comes off like a lack-luster copy.  I will read the second book, but my purchase of the third will depend on this getting a little better...
B002RWKSII|5.0|The best thing about this purchase, like all CD's is the availability that requires only a little patience and planning.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|I did a lot of research before purchasing this watch.  Im not a collector of things.  Things that I own I use.  This seiko is very affordable, it is a steal for what you get.  Reliability, solar power, chronograph, 200m dive watch, screw down case/crown/pushers, date window, luminous markers, bezel, and great style.  It is the perfect size for me.  Not to big like some watches I have seen, nice and thick, very solid, yet IMO can easily pass as a dress watch.  I have it on a brown leather band and it looks both sporty and sophisticated.  It has everything I wanted and I am honestly very satisfied with this watch and plan on keeping it a long time.  Thank you seiko and amazon.
B007JRU2UK|2.0|Kind of a downer too, but I guess if you're in the mood for a gentle, lazy movie about privileged yet unhappy white hawaiians then this is it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The eighties are revisited in this tale of computer gaming. While it is science fiction, it totally imaginable as a possible future. Anyone whose even played Pac Man will find this story unique.
B007MJSQSK|1.0|So I only had a short window of time to watch this movie. and for some reason, streaming wasn't working on my kindle fire. so frustrating and a waste of time.
1451638647|5.0|An engrossing read. Great to see an adventure featuring that idiot Ivan not being an idiot. Al the thrills and spills you expect from Bujold including the unexpected
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The writers of this show have a truly warped imagination....and that is SPLENDID!!!  You think you have seen it all and then they surprise or shock you or whatever you want to call it and it is wicked fun.
B006LSZECO|4.0|As I was reading Book 1 I thought to myself 'ho hum, same ole, same ole, I've read this all before'. Then the first bombshell appears in the opening of Book 2 (don't read ahead and spoil it for yourself). Then, just when you think you've got the character figured out and you have a solid feeling for the plot, Book 3 launches the third and final bombshell. I honestly didn't see any of these plot twists coming. A pleasant surprise. The only reason the book didn't receive 5 starts is completely a personal opinion - I found the ending disturbing. EXCELLENT read!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|The DVD was in perfect condition when it arrived! I would definitely recommend this movie to any horror movie fans!
B00975L81Y|5.0|COF have always intrigued me, and I love how they present their music.  Sophisticated yet dark and sinister; the ingredients that make them incredibly unique and admirable.  I have loved COF since they I heard \\"Born in a Burial Ground\\" but hadn't really truly paid attention until I heard \\"Her Ghost in the Fog.\\"  COF is truly a one-of-a-kind band that will influence a wide and vast genre for decades to come.  This album is exactly why this band will never fail, they may have changed their sound structure a bit over the years, but they have never veered off the beaten path they have laid down.  Every album from COF is a trademark of how black metal and extreme metal should sound like.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  It was exciting and compelling.  I had a hard time putting it down!
B0053JJLLC|3.0|Almost his words<br />Too predictable an ending needs the &#34;Crighton&#34; touch!<br />Would of loved to of been a hurry and turn the page book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I couldn't wait to get into the second book of this series and I flew threw it.  I was shocked by the suspenseful ending, but compelled to get to the third book without delay.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|If there's any Avenged Sevenfold item anyone should own, this is it. In time I have gotten to watch several DVD's from different bands playing live and this is by far one of my favorite. Video, music quality and energy is amazing and you'll have a great time with their performance.<br /><br />PS: As far as the Diamonds in the Rough is, that's exactly what they are. Even though they're pretty much B-Sides, you will find yourself asking \\"why didn't this make it to the self-titled?\\" in more than one song. This is a win-win situation. Get it ASAP!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|but overall it does the trick.  It turns on when I go into the little dark section of the hall.  Good enough for four stars.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good read for kindle apps or devices.  Got for the boy to read for school credits and such.  Great price!
0385535147|2.0|I have read all of Grisham's books and agree with most readers that his earlier works were far superior.  This is yet another mediocre yarn from him.  Because he waits late in the book to put in the 'kicker' character, the beginning chapters seem to be vague with meandering fill in thoughts regarding what it is like to be wrongfully incarcerated.  I think we could all figure that out for ourselves.<br /><br />Even the plot was predictable and not well disguised at all.  I found the characters shallow and again, lots of fill in descriptive narrative rather than good dialogue.<br /><br />I'm afraid Grisham has gone the way of most best selling authors - permanently.  Just churn out at least one book every six months no matter how thin the plot or dull the characters.  I also think it's my last effort to put hope that he will once again write a novel to equal The Rainmaker.  I'll save my money.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|its fun to play to chat and even if i dont win alot the anticipation is fun.<br />I love this game! I would suggest it to anyone. You will never be board!!!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this is an amsing game you get to build<br />uwill love it thers bouns levels soon you wont<br />to stop.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Hours and hours of the Beatles! With tracks that I had not heard for years. The memories and feelings of those halcyon days come flooding in as the music flows out. The Beatles are a big part of an amazing decade of hope, fear and a rebirth of the American  societal psyche.<br /><br />If you didn't live through the 60's maybe the music will give a sense of those heady times and that alone might be worth listening to the whole Beatles catalog. Oh so sweet.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I ordered the first book knowing that they are making a movie.  The hype indicates that this series is going to be the next Twilight which I loved.  To me, there were parts in this book specifically that drug out a little too long.  I'm debating on whether or not to even finish the series...
B002VECMAE|5.0|WIth a great cast, a wacky premise, and not much of hit in theatres... I guess I didn't know what to expect. I was really pleased with this sort of feel good story of black ops far out antics. It was just plain funny and with a fantastic cast. Not for everyone but it hit my comedy/feel-good sweet spot.
B008602KQI|4.0|I like this movie a lot and can't wait to use it in my classroom after we read the novel.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Great! I have recomended this to may of my friends and clients. Everyone I know who saw this movie was shocked that this rerally did happen.
0345803507|5.0|I love this story but do not love the way it was written.  The author repeats a lot of words when writing which got old.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Watched it 3 times, and I enjoy it every time. Very entertaining. Setting is a bit old, but that is what also makes it interesting.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|The movie is okay.  I was not really impressed with the story line and had a hard time suspending my belief.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Great series, glad that this item has been reduced in price. I will be getting the next dvd set as a present for someone when it comes out!
0345803493|5.0|Love this book.  A really good story but the writing is not done that well.  The author tells a good story but needs to work on the writing portion.  She likes to repeat a lot of words and a lot of the story is redundant.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|It was okay.I guess I would reccommend this movie to friends. I am running out of things to say about it.
B009NCM248|5.0|This is one of the best cds I have bought this year. The cd starts out strong with Gone Sovereign and Absolute Zero. This whole album is amazing and is most definitely worth the money especially since I got it for 5.99 off of Amazon mp3 store.
B005LAIGSC|3.0|The movie is great...No issues with playing discs. The only reason I purchased this particular Combo pack was because it included the Ultraviolet digital copy. The problem was that the Ultravoilet code was expired by the time I received the product (it expired a few months before I even ordered the movie). There was no indication of this in the product details so I had no way of knowing this before purchasing.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It pretty sad when your 3 1/2yr old is better at this game then you are... It works on hand-eye coordination for my kid, as well as problem solving.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I mainly use this for adding up bills. I like that it has percent and division available as crazy as it sounds some calculators don't have them. Installing was easy and i've never had a problem with this application.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is THE BEST weather APP I have found.  There are many different widget style choices so you can pick and choose what, where and how big it is.  Good updating and no noticeable effect on battery performance on my Galaxy S2
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book one is where it all begins.  I am looking for a prequel to come out soon.  Want to read that too!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Awesome deal. Just saying. Shame this series had to end when it did. Apparently fox television CAN take the sky from me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this series (so did my husband.  He loved the &#34;extra&#34; things that came from it).  Would recommend for any adult.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I want to read more about them it was a great read . just finished the 2nd book is there more books out ?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such an awesome series.  It is graphic and has a lot of sex in it, so I wold not let a younger person read this!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|It was marvelous! I found myself racking my brains trying to discover what I could combine to create elements unknown to me in this game! Currently, I'm about halfway through. I started with four elements. Air, water, fire and earth. that was several days ago. now, I have one hundred and forty three of them. It's paced quickly enough that it never gets boring. I also adored the fact that it has a kid-friendly version, eliminating alcholol and all other unwholesome things that young eyes don't need to see.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All I can say is,I want more. I couldn't put one book down without having the next ! Thank you!
B001KQ4UM2|5.0|Venetia lives next door to the home of 'the evil baron.'  They meet by accident one day when she is trespassing on his grounds.  This is a very delightful and unusual romance by the creator of modern regency romances.  Venetia is one of my favourite Georgette Heyer heroines.  She is completely unique and yet very easy to identify with.  I love how she solves her problems and gets what she wants despite everyone else's good intentions.  Like Heyer's other romances, the historical authenticity is such that one can immerse oneself in the story without any jarring anachronisms or painful social lapses.  This book and light and funny, a quick and easy read for a sunny afternoon or something you can take on the bus or train for commuting.  I really love this book, and would love for others to get as much fun and enjoyment out of it as I have.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Bought this for my daughter down in Southern Cal where she hits the beach a lot.  Keeps her iphone safe and her father worry-free!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Still reading this, but CLASSIC Stephen King!  Scary without the boogeyman (or maybe there is!); the hairs on the back of your neck will stand up!
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Using with iPhone 5. Different settings for different sounds. Small and unobtrusive. Quality cables. Easy to figure out; many thanks to reviewers for their tips. No patience for printed instruction anyway which I could barely make out. Also helps to have the right cable ends plugged into the right holes. Other than constantly fighting the very stiff short L-shape 3.5mm to 3.5mm Mini Stereo Line Cable that stays curled, it provides great sound for the price. Contemplating whether I want to spend another $10 for the straight short cable.
B009GED3HS|4.0|This season so far has been slow to start but the comedy is always there at least. I'm hoping that they move the Robin and Barney story along. It's about time that happens.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|My wife wouldn't watch it if I paid her $100 but I thought it was great.  I had to rent it while she was out doing other things.:)
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This show is my all time favorite show to watch. The characters are awesome and the actors have such amazing chemistry together. Doesn't matter who it is, they play off each other so well.
B009LUBA7M|4.0|Mika's back with some great new stuff in his distinctive style. A must for all his fans and open-minded music appreciators.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This season is better than what I was anticipating. I was worried about how Jeanne Tripplehorn would fit in with the dynamics already established with this superb group of actors. Her character has been a nice addition. Glad that it is working out. Love this show!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|We haven't watched a show this engaging since the first couple of seasons of 24.  Acting and writing is superb.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I came in on this show in the middle of it's 2nd season. Now I'm hooked and this season so far is phenomenal. The growth that Rick and Carl are going through has been so challenging and amazing. I've cried this season because of some of things that have happened. It was so soul wrenching. The rest of the group has really come together and definitely seem like a family now.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Very well written; great plot and realistic scenario! This is a story that could actually happen in today's crazy world...very insightful.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I started playing this on my iPod and loooved it. I'm so glad it is now on my kindle!!!!!!! BEST APP EVER!!!!!! MUST GET IT!!!!!!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|It can be as simple or as advanced as you like. Great program. Developer is responsive.  Had it on IOS. It is just as good on Android.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|my granddaughter loves to be able to set her own music combine for naptime.  love the options that she has
1455502758|5.0|Fitting way for Hitchens to send us off. Much of it I had read in his Vanity Fair pieces, but it is a wonderful volume to close his work out for mankind.
B00009NQQO|1.0|I am not sure if we got a defective item but it does not stick to the shower tile. The suction cups do not work. The hoop is extremely small.
B007THA4FI|4.0|ending was blah just stopped why why why why why why why why why why why why why why 18
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Found this book completely intriguing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plot which I found to be rather unusual but which absorbed me totally. Found the characters very interesting and quite complex. Would recommend it to people who enjoy suspense and intrigue.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Heart Pounder, edge of my seat move. Love the action. Perfect, loved seeing all my favorites. Lots of shooting and suspence
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Nice easy to use app. Does just what you would want it to. I like that you can change to another app and it keeps your last entry. timesaver
B002QGUFWE|2.0|There should be, at a minimum, a large bold-faced warning that this album says \\"I'm a free bit, baby.\\" I a m 46 years old, I don't need to be protected from the proper name for an unneutered female dog. Every time I hear \\"bit\\" I feel like a scolded Catholic-school kindergartener.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Having read & lived the Grey series, I was recommended these. Really enjoyed them - flew through them, but be warned they are VERY similar to Ms James' work! But worth the read. Enjoy.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|More tedious than fun, and not intuitive.  The hint keeps guiding me toward puzzles I don't have all the pieces to complete.  I've been looking at the map to get an idea what to do next, and the only place that indicates \\"activity available\\" is where there's a puzzle I don't have all the parts for.  It also sets me back several steps every time I shut down.
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|A movie / musical... not what I'm usually used to but I liked the movie overall. Cruise was good in this as well.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|This CD exceeded my expectations. Usually there are some songs that I don't especially like, but I thought all of these were really good.
B008KWHM6U|1.0|Absolutely loved every track on the first album and was really looking forward to this album.<br />I liked the first single Sleep alone but after many listening's and thinking it would grow on me i gave up .<br />Seems like they are trying to appeal to young teenage girls.<br />Such a shame they had so much potential and a unique sound that's gone to waste.
0061726834|3.0|This book was good, it didn't live up to all the hype for me but I still liked it and am interested enough in the characters and their world to go out and pick up Pandemonium the second book in the series. The beginning started off a little slow for me mainly because Oliver obviously took her time building up the society they live in and letting us in on every detail so we can understand it fully. Now the second half was much more fast paced and really grabbed my attention, especially those last few chapters, so much happened that I have to pick up the next book to see what happens next.<br /><br />I really loved the concept of the book. The fact that they used love and made it to be a disease and then manipulated the people in their society with it in order to have control over them was pretty original. I did find the romance predictable but at the same time I expected it going in so that wasn't much of a disappointment.<br /><br />As for the main characters, Lena didn't grow on me until the ending. For majority of the book I didn't really find her interesting at all but with the way the book ended I have a feeling I'm going to love the hell out of her character in the next book. As for Alex I really liked his character especially when we learned more about him and then that ending ... I need to know what happened to him, I don't think I realized how into his character I was until the end of the book.<br /><br /> If you haven't figured it out by my review the book ends with a heart-rending cliffhanger and I am so glad I waited to read this because there is no way I would have been able to wait a year to see what happens next. If you love Dystopian pick Delirium up, it was well worth the read.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|We have really enjoyed this monitor.  Our last monitor went out and even though our son is almost out growing a monitor we still wanted to be able to on him due to asthma problems.  Also, we can be out of town and still look in on him while the grandparents are taking care of him.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie was very cool! The bluray and DVD combo was also very nice. I would recommend for anyone who wants a good blockbuster movie.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read this one super fast.  I got so into the characters and had to know was going to happen.  I read this in just a few nights.  There is certainly a cliffhanger that you just have to read the last one.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|This is one of the most artistic and addicting albums I've heard in a long time. If you enjoy psychadelic rock you will be truly amazed. Highly recommend!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this after my friends were all raving about it when we watched the movie together.  So I gave into the pressure and read it.  It was really engaging and I read it in just a few days (a week at the most).  They get you hooked with this one and then you HAVE to read the other two.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|No other App out there compares to this one!  I can set the timer to dose off or to slowly wake myself up.  I can select/create my own combination of sounds and save it.  Simple to use and very much appreciate using this app to get me relaxing.  Thank you Ipnos!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The first one is certainly the best, but I probably read this one even faster then the first.  I got so involved with the characters that I just had to know what happened.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Excellent product that allows me to carry pertinent medical files with me to my doctors' visits without having to carry a bunch of hardcopy files.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|An emphsis on her illness and not on her great accomplishments.  Meryl was good, but the script was not good.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|some features don't work/aren't accessible.  you'd think otherwise, right?<br /><br />save yourself the frustration & just bookmark it.  don't bother getting this app!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|it is fun. normal village building game. but fun.would recommend it if you like that sort of thing. :) nice.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|tiles are so tiny on my kindle screen it is tough to differentiate some of the tiles.<br />going to delete it from my kindle.
B008ROH07W|5.0|There are some vocals with this and the singers are just as fabulous as the trumpet player, Alison Balsom.  Great classical pieces.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm hooked.  and those creatures that chase the runner - nightmarish!  love it!<br /><br />The only thing is either my kindle craps out or there is a snafu in the game system.  every now  then when i turn my screen, the runner stays put.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For the price this device is perfect for a quick sharpen on your multitool or basic knife.  i wouldn't use it for anything you want a razor edge on but it works great for everything else.  Even works pretty good on the serrated edge of the knife as it was designed.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Wonderful!  When I saw that I could get the whole season on Blu-Ray for an awesome price I had to get it!
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Gary Oldman is one of the greatest actor's alive I think. WE have watched this like four times and each time it just gets better
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I read a galley copy of this book a few years ago and absolutely loved it - I think I finished it in two days.  (Full disclosure, I'm a huge fan of post-apocalyptic fiction).  So when the movie came out, I ordered a copy on my Kindle (as a side-note, I would recommend reading a physical copy of the book, because each story has it's own typeface, which I found added to the evolution of the book).<br /><br />I really struggled with the first chapter, both times I nearly gave up.  But the story really picks up after that.  I think what I loved most about this book was that it was so many types of genre in one, but all with a connecting thread.  Part confusing, part thrilling, part thought-provoking, I definitely recommend Clout Atlas.
B004LROUW2|5.0|I'm not sure why I like/love this.  Somehow the story just flows, very and incredibly well.  It just flows along at a nice comfortable pace, seemingly... to something that is building... but yet unknown... to perhaps an outstanding culminating event that brings everything together into a united whole.<br />Maybe dramatically...  Anyway... here's hoping.. page. 204...<br />I'm giving him 5 stars only because of his style and his story weaving skill, and of course as well to his translater.  (J. Rubin)  But who know..<br />status reports coming...<br /><br />about 45 days later...<br />In conclusion, the story was somewhat anti-climatic in the sense that after bringing in parallel worlds so early, he left with just a whimper of that recklessness but somehow was able to achieve a well thought out and difficult for the antagonists to reach, end to the story that was still emotional, thought provoking and in the end... well.... an ending that I didn't want to see.  I could've follow these characters for hundreds of more pages.  Perhaps thousands.<br />I like this guy.  I just bought two more, \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" and \\"Hard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the World.\\"<br />I'm now a fan and have now voted with hard earned funds.<br />more reviews to come...
B002LL1686|5.0|The second movie  &#34;The Proposal&#34; received worked on our Blu-Ray here in Japan.  Credit received for the returned movie that would not work here in Japan.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|My wife actually purchased this movie. I'm not a fan of fantasy movies, but this was done well & and I enjoyed it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Excellent movie - would recommend to all who enjoy action films with beautiful scenery.  Great cinematogrophy and 3D is spectacular.
B0085Y4JF0|3.0|I have owned a few different Condor products over the past few years and this one has been the only one to fail me. First some stitching came out on the straps that hang down over your chest and today the buckle snapped. There is no way to replace this buckle other than cutting the loop and resewing it. But what can you expect for $35
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This was an incredible story!!<br />Starts out in one direction, twists into another and in the end what you expect...is not what you get!!<br />Well Done!!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|It snapped on to my Nikon D3100 and worked great out of the box. I just need to remember to turn it on first before using the camera.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. continues to amaze as Iron Man.<br />This is another great Sci Fi and it is so nice to have all the Marvel characters together....<br />Can't wait for the next edition.....I saw the preview for Iron Man 3 at the movies yesterday....looks awesome.....

B001VTTRC6|5.0|and Tim Robbins and Sean Penn and Marcia Harden (and maybe Kevin Bacon at his best too).  This a dark story, a remarkable interpretation of Lehane's novel.  If you read the range of reviews here it almost entirely has to do with taste.  Moral messiness doesn't please a lot people, that shouldn't stop you from seeing this as a powerful movie.

B005LAIGNC|4.0|This film was panned by critics from my generation (mid-thirties) when it came out earlier this year but I am glad I ignored them. They were mostly complaining that the film was too sappy and the actingwas terrible. However when I watched the film, it was obvious to me the filmmakers were trying to make a war film like they did back in the 50's and 60's. I really loved the style of this film and its overall innocence. My dad absolutely loved it and I ended up buying him this film on Blu Ray for his birthday.
034580404X|5.0|Loved this book series. Was so excited to be able to find it on Amazo as a set. Good reading!!!!
B008RV5K5E|2.0|\\"Hey, let's turn one of the greatest comic book stories ever into an animated short, and because we were so smart to think of it, we'll throw everything that is pure Frank Miller out the window.\\"<br /><br />That must have been how the first production meeting went for project. I read the original when It came out and I was just out of high school, have always wanted a good animated version, and I'm still waiting. The animation isn't that great, it pays homage to Miller's style but so did an old episode of \\"Batman the animated series\\", which I felt captured this better. Nor was I impressed by any voices but Gordon's, just not good matches. But the worst affront to the original, is the complete abandonment of Miller's storytelling style. Miller's character's are defined by having internal monologues that speak volumes, to even attempt to translate the book to a movie without that mechanism seems ridiculous. That same internal monologue carried the movies \\"300\\" and \\"Sin City\\" so well, that to turn your back on it when making the Dark Knight returns, I feel we are all owed an explanation by the director as to why he would do so. So that's it, they adapted the \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" without \\"I think of Sara, and the rest is easy\\", \\"leaving the world no poorer, 4 men die\\" or the often repeated \\"This would be a good death......but not good enough\\". One of the many things that made the original so good was Miller's writing, and here they've thrown over half of it out. So sadly the whole thing feels holy and not very Milleresque, besides the internal monologue lots of even spoken lines are left out, for no real reason. So it took them nearly 25 years to adapt \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" and they only used a 3rd of it, go figure.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Great! Pink at her finest, she sings the songs for all of us who feel like this, but dont have the words or the guts to express ourselves Blast some Pink you will feel powerful. Strong, Beautiful, Truthful.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|tried to kill vampires but it didnt work. maybe because i was a president.but i will keep at it until i have killed them all. awesome documentry.

1594200653|5.0|I have long been interested in history, mainly ancient and classical.  I was aware of the events described in this book and have memories of that time. I graduated from college in 1956 and received a commission in the army as a combat engineer unit commander. My only service was many years in the active reserve.  I have memories of the Castro take over in Cuba since I was at the Cape during that time working on the Minuteman Missile Test program.  I was also at an air force base at the time of the missile crisis where the air crews were on alert ready to bomb Cuba.  They were in their flight suits with flight bags and side arms watching President Kennedy on TV at the officers club.  The book ties the history of Europe together and describes the elements that went into the recovery and tensions of the time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|loads quick and is a great time killer. i am glad there are no automatic hint or mltiple levels simple wnd fun on my kindoe love it

B009HEJXFS|5.0|Good movie...always loved the MIB franchise!  Miss the pug and Agent Zed! Great special effects! Good family movie...enjoyed the dude from Flight of the Concords as the badie!
B000LB7G00|5.0|Almost all 3D CAD software out there supports this. I use it with Rhino 3D , Solidworks , Altium Designer , Google Earth and even in tools like Illustrator.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I am not quite finished reading-the book downloaded a little weird-not sure if it is Amazon's deal or something with my kindle
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This movie is awesome for all those girl fans that want to see a princess kick some butt. The characters were the type that you fall in love with. It had enough action too.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Great old-fashioned ghost story with tons of atmosphere and great performances that will make the hair on the back of your head stand up.  Enjoy!
0394818237|5.0|I love Richard Scarry, this book is great and educational. Some things are sort of incorrect, like going outside and using a lever box to call the firemen instead of using 911, but it still teaches some good lessons. I also think this book goes great with [[ASIN:0603550568 Richard Scarry's Busy, Busy World]] or [[ASIN:030716828X Going Places]] which contains Busy, Busy World. It's out of print, but you can find it for fairly cheap on etsy or ebay. They are just also great educational stories from Scarry, but about different countries rather than professions.
B000AP04EW|4.0|i like it it's a good assasin movie about a couple in love. great chic flic. or for any couple.
0399208534|5.0|This book is awesome for younger children who are eager to help turn the pages, they were very thick in the hardback copy we got. Seem like they would be really difficult to tear. It also tells a cute classic story about a caterpillar becoming a butterfly.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Good beats and good songs...finally a rapper with something to say other then the usual crap u hear on radio.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was our selection for book club, I didn't finish it before our meeting, but after the rave reviews by our members, I finished it & liked it a lot.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Super cute game.  Definitely glitches sometimes, and I wish it were easier to earn gems.  This is a game that requires a lot of patience, but the mini games are fun, the ponies are adorable, and I love watching them show up in little hot air balloons.  When connecting to gameloft live, things often load pretty slowly, and even a day later, sometimes friends I've added haven't shown up in game like they should.  Still one of my favorite games to play though.
B005HP2JAM|4.0|I saw there were already 90+ reviews and thought I'd pass, then I saw one that said \\"boring.\\"  I felt the need to address that so readers could weigh both sides of the matter.  The reviewer said that they felt the same images were presented too many times.  Perhaps for some that might = boring.  But as someone who has traveled extensively, I can share a different perspective.  I find that the second and third visit to a place brings different insights.  Different approaches, angles, lighting and mental prep all contribute to a layered, rich experience.  So for me, the idea of revisiting images a few times is perfect.  If a quick take is all you need, perhaps something else would be a better choice, but if you find your understanding of things evolves with thought and multiple viewings, this is a very good DVD.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Game moves really slowly. Its cuteness is probably the only reason I'm still playing it after 3 days.  You basically tap on something, and then exit out while buildings are constructed or an egg is incubating for 3-5 hours.  Pretty absurd.
B0089AD8IO|4.0|I ordered this version of the set and the description talks about the sixth disc but there are only 5 discs and there is only room for 5 discs in the case.  This is very typical of Amazon to have incorrect descriptions.  Bummer.  As for the show, 5 stars.  As for Amazon description 4 stars.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|I only played this game for about 15 minutes.  Too hard to level up to get to a point where the game is even playable with the difficulty increasing so fast.  Would not reccomend for children.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My son had this game on his I-Phone.  But when Kindle Fire first came out it was not available.  YEAH!!!  so glad that it is now available...  Great game.  Love playing it.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|Poor graphics.  If it weren't so pixelated it might have been a little more interesting. Even so, it's still a story game with lots of waiting invovled.
1451695195|5.0|I am stunned at the number of people who want to believe so badly that they will ignore anything and everything to get and keep their toe in the door of this most absurd idea.<br /><br />I wonder how many have read the book?<br /><br />I wonder how many have bothered to even think hard and critically about the very idea?<br /><br />I wonder how many truly understand that an \\"eternity\\" of anything could be the best definition of hell ever conceived.<br /><br />I wonder how many understand that if there were such a thing as a heaven as most people want it to be - how it would ruin, better destroy, the enjoyment of the life we actually do get to have right here and right now.
B007M45PMU|5.0|There seems to be a new movement of modern folk coming about and the Lumineers are one of the pioneers of this new genre. If you like Mumford and Sons or Phillip Phillips, you'll probably like them too.
034580404X|5.0|The price is better for the trilogy than it is to purchase separately and it was received before the expected date. I recommend these books to anyone looking for erotic romance.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I got this charger as a replacement to the original kindle charger, and I really like it. It charges very fast, very portable.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|Very nice tracks-a few more will be great singles. Call me baby is great single but several others will be almost as big
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is more what I wanted Virtual City to be.  I would have preferred having a vacation mode so the city doesn't run when the game is not being played.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|Very Nice tracks-unique voice. There are sveral tracks that will be great singles. I had only heard one of her songs before I bought this and was pleasantly pleased with the entire set.
1451627289|5.0|Excellent , King book as always he writes compelling drama that leaves one wanting more!<br />a very good read. Buy it.
B008J34466|4.0|Nice tracks for adults..lots of swearing for young listeners though..one for her best with some nice variety. Pink at her &#34;in your face&#34; best self..
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great read, very entertaining, and it really takes off in the last volume. The lead female character was great, and this would make the best movie ever!
B0074VTHKM|4.0|This is a fun read. It doesn't have the intensity of some Grisham books, but it does keep you interested. I read this one in the series first, but I wish I'd read them in order.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Narrated by a husband and a wife (via her diary entries over the course of several years) Gone Girl is the riveting and enthralling story of a missing wife and the subsequent suspicion placed on the husband in her disappearance. Almost as ripped from the headlines of several major cases, such as the Scott Peterson trial, Gone Girl keeps you guessing about the location and fate of the wife, as well as the innocence or guilt of the husband. Unlike other mystery novels that involve missing spouses, we actually get to hear from the missing spouse herself from the very first pages of the novel. This ties the two stories together brilliantly and later leads to a major plot twist that will leave you stunned. (I was reading it on a train and squealed when the twist was revealed!!) By no means a love story, Gone Girl revolves around a marriage that started extremely happy and turned rather dysfunctional after a slew of stressors. Do keep in mind that this is more of a psychological thriller than an action packed thriller. It will leave you wondering about the capabilities of those closest to you in times of desperation...
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me guessing and was an enjoyable read. I would recommend it if you are looking for a quick read
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I just finished reading all of these books and I can hardly wait until the next season on HBO.  The characters are great and I just can't get enough.  Looking forward to the next book in the series
B005IQZB14|4.0|Not what I expected but I liked it nonetheless. I was expecting a little less of a memoir and more of an adventure story but I ended up really enjoying this book.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Still can't view some of my apps that require Adobe Flash player.  Didn't find Adobe at Amazon Apps store so tried SWF.
0060734191|5.0|I love these series. The books come in good quality. I highly recommend it to someone to read. Fairly easy to read.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I'm giving it four stars because of Johnny Depp.  If you like his wit, and a story line based around revenge, you will like this movie.
B004DTXJ4S|5.0|I am such a fan of the Resident Evil Movies. And as always this one did not let me down. I could watch it over and over. I probably will watch it over and over.
B000I3PERS|5.0|One of the best movies ever produced<br /><br />Pros - Everyone should watch this movie<br /><br />Cons - a little graphic at times<br /><br />Recommend - Yes
B006TLFPKO|5.0|This movie did not disappoint. I love the fact I can watch it on my Kindle when I am away on a business trip.
B009329Y30|4.0|Good day night movie<br /><br />Would recommend even for the tough guys to watch.  Something of value in this movie for everyone
B009DCOU9S|5.0|You should really try this game!  I love this game!!  The graphics. are wonderful. If you enjoy searching for things' then this one is for you. Do not forget to put on your thinking cap because in some places things can be tough to find.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|fell asleep so it's tough to give a true evaluation.  However, I doubt I will give it a second try.
B009329Y30|5.0|Nicholas Sparks knows how to write some outstanding books.  This one is no exception.  The producer portrayed the characters well.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
B0073LWEXK|3.0|The graphics on this game are decent for what it does, but it's the most boring game I've played in years.  You just wander around clicking on paths, until you finally get to a screen that has a useful item in it.  On each screen there is at least one interactive object, but you don't get to interact with it until you have the proper item in your sack.<br />I was hoping for something a little faster paced, or at least interesting.  lol
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the BEST GAME EVER!!! It is so addictive. I love how it changes for the different holidays. If a had a choice between this and any other game I would choose subway suffers.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|A great way to end the series.  Señor Ruiz Zafon has wond my intellectual heart.  This series (and book) are the only  that have held my attention and been unpredictable in many years.  I would highly reccomend this book, after you read the first two in the series.
B0034JKZ86|3.0|My daughter loves this movie. However, it was alittle scratched when we received it. But it plays non the less
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I rather enjoyed this game when I first downloaded it.  Then 4 days later it completely reset on me, and I had to start all over.  Then it would freeze my kindle fire and I would have to turn it off to get back to functionality, I tried to uninstall and then reinstall and nothing changed.  I wouldn't reccomend this product.
B009ANP48G|5.0|I own \\"Step Up 3D\\" and \\"Street Dance\\". I had certain expectations about this movie based on those movies and the trailer for this one, but I have to say \\"Step Up: Revolution\\" greatly exceeded those expectations. The dance routines are spectacular (The museum segment is my favorite.), the music is excellent, the story is very good, and there is a chemistry between the leads with a romantic relationship that's well-developed, tasteful and never saccharine. This movie deserves to be a classic.
B0074V3712|5.0|In this book E.O. Wilson articulates the applications of his field to the world we live in. Following the latest attacks on sociobiology in 2010 and 2011, Wilson shows that sociobiology is not a dogma by discussing its limitations, and explains how it has evolved over the years as its limitations have been shown.  This book explains how our species evolved the unique capacity for gene-culture co-evolution and how that led to creativity, art and religion. The subplot of Wilson's own open-minded struggle with his Christianity is of particular intrest. The renowned evolutionary biologist makes peace with his religion, in a way that satisfied an atheist like me, by looking at not only why religion evolved, but how it became a tool of repression. Wilson has a unique knack for finding the best in humanity without being unrealistic as he acknowledges that the structures that allow for us to work together for good also allow us to do the terrible things are species is also known for. Ultimately this is the most important component of his work: an understanding of what we are capable of that informs our choices as beings with free will.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for anyone interested in an introduction to the evolutionary history of humanity based on survival through cooperation and competition that affirms the power of humanity as a creative force. It is as eloquently written as Wilson's classic work [[ASIN:0674074424 Biophilia]] but with a closer focus on humans and what it means to be human. I'd recommend Lynn Margulis' [[ASIN:0465072720 Symbiotic Planet: A New Look At Evolution]] as a great companion piece, as it explains the same process of formations of complex orders through symbiosis on the nonhuman scales.
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|Although I liked the original Tron, I wouldn't call myself a fan of Tron. I appreciated it, for its technical achievements. Tron Legacy, I really enjoyed. This was just a fun movie. The effects, costumes, everything worked well to make this movie work. And the special features are really good, too.<br />I have watched this on DVD and on blue ray. Blu ray you can really tell the difference. It's just so much more crisp of a picture.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I'm happy where they went with the story, it wasnt ruined.<br />I really enjoyed it and I went in thinking I wouldn't like it at all.<br />Well made and awesome CGI.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Not only is this the best comic book movie EVER, it looks fantastic on blu ray. The special features are good, too. But there could be more. It's this generation's Star Wars. Not so much the effects (which are danm good) but because of the scope of this film and unexpected box office success. If you have not seen this movie yet, due yourself a favor and at least rent it. It's just a fun movie.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Grandchildren loved it !! The film was very exciting for the kids. They say and watched it all and didnt leave.
B005J4TLQG|4.0|Not only do I like this movie, but its Sharp and crisp, on blu ray.<br />If you have trouble understanding the thicker British accents, you may not enjoy this. The creature designs, for this movie is some of the best I've seen. And they way they executed them is brilliant.
0307341550|1.0|I see others have read and loved this book. Not me. I find it depressing, void, and vague. I'll give the author room for doubt, but I also ordered her two other books and will never read them. This is not my type of literature.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This may be the best movie I've ever seen.  It made me want to be a better person.<br />Sandra Bullock was perfect for this movie
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Awesome series. Bought this one for birthday gift, which was loved by him as well. Can't wait for next season
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I love this show, I have to watch it every year during the holidays, it reminds me so much of my dad.
0812993357|3.0|The standard disclaimer applies. I received this book as a promotional copy from GoodReads and what I can only assume was an overzealous use of the 'request this book' button.<br /><br />In all the technical ways that a book can be so this one was completely adequate. The author is a sufficiently skilled one and has many diverse stories to tell from her life and she shares them with openness and skill. Her career in the fashion industry for several decades is clearly one worth writing about as she seems to have met everyone who was ever anyone or even had a chance to be anyone. Unlike many memoirs her presentation is detailed without being egotistical and on a personal level she seems quite a nice person. She describes her own problems with anxiety around people and crowds in a way that I find very easy to relate to and sympathize with. Grace Coddington presents to her readers a good life well-lived.<br /><br />I was rather astonished though by the almost dismissive manner in which she related events from her own life. She seems to have managed to divorced half a dozen husbands with barely a mention of them. Major milestones in her life fly by only hinted at in some cases. Perhaps this was intended to emphasize her career rather than personal life but it did rather leave me wanting more of Grace the person rather than Grace the public figure.<br /><br />In the end though this was completely impossible to wade through. After 120 pages of name-dropping about people I'd never heard of (but obviously should have) I quickly skimmed through the rest and put it aside. It's well-executed but not for everyone.
B000687M48|5.0|I would buy this just for the bonus DVD.  It is a full length concert that is just plain awesome.  It is so good that it must have been staged in Paris just for the purpose of making a drop-dead good DVD.  Amy Lee's performance is just incredible.  If you are even remotely a fan, this is a must-have.
0547884591|5.0|I have now purchased all of Tim's books.  I think it is amazing what Tim has done, and really find it amazing that he is only 35!<br /><br />I highly recommend the books for anyone, whether you are serious about what he lays out or just want to look at things through a different point of view.<br /><br />Of all the books, I have to say that the cooking appeals to me the least in terms of what it is 'showing' me how to do.  But at the same time, I have found it to be the best written book and the insight into the areas beyond cooking are amazing.<br /><br />Great job Tim!<br /><br />I look forward to the next project.

B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Paul Tough's conclusions can be summed up very briefly:<br />- the biggest obstacle to academic & life success is a home & a community that create high levels of stress, and the absence of a secure relationship with a caregiver that would allow a child to manage stress;<br />- non-cognitive skills, like conscientiousness, grit, resilience, perseverance and optimism are more important than cognitive skills for young people to succeed in life;<br />- character matters; as the author points out, conservatives are right about this. But character is molded by the environment and as a society we can do a lot to influence its development in children; as the author points out, liberals are right about this. \\"We now know a great deal about what kind of interventions will help children develop those strengths and skills, starting at birth and going all the way through college.\\" (p. 196).<br /><br />To get to those conclusions the author takes the reader on a very interesting journey, and that is what makes the book superb. It is well written and a treasure throve of scientific insights and cutting edge research, with moving stories about students, teachers and schools that make the science alive. Mr. Tough introduces the reader to innovative interventions for children and adolescents while painting insightful portraits of the people at the forefront in the quest to develop (or at least not squander) the human capital of this nation.<br /><br />I felt the author's position was very balanced. While looking for successes in his reporting, he does not shy away from highlighting the difficulties and the unknown: e.g., he puts the early successful KIPP's results into perspective, with the good, the bad and what can be done differently; you got a sense this topic is still a work in progress; he makes it very clear that \\"No one [author's emphasis] has found a reliable way to help deeply disadvantaged children, in fact.\\"(p. 193).<br />But overall there is a sense that, in the end, wewill figure it out. A sense of possibility.<br /><br />For passion and for work I read a lot of books about psychology, neuroscience & leadership / personal development. I always learn a lot.<br />But this book is different. Not only did I learn a lot. I was also moved.<br />I was totally absorbed and emotionally involved in the stories of the kids the author features in his narrative.<br />Mr Tough says that when he spent time with these young people he felt \\"a sense of anger for what they've already missed.\\"<br />I felt the same way - and that goes to his credit. I almost feel as if I personally know little James Black  or Kewauna. I did get mad on their behalf.<br />Mr. Tough also says he had a second reaction: \\"a feeling of admiration and hope when I watch young people making the difficult and often painful choice to follow a better path, to turn away from what might have seemed like their inevitable destiny.\\"  (p. 197).<br />That is what I felt as well - again, to Mr. Tough's credit.<br /><br />I am already doing some volunteer work with Big Brothers, Big Sisters.<br />But you get sucked in the local situation and your horizons get narrower.<br />Reading this book widened my perspective and made me fully appreciate the depth of the problem but also the promise of better days to come if we embrace a new way to tackle it.<br />So I made the resolution to get more involved next year.<br /><br />Here is my recommendation: read the book.<br />You will learn a lot - about neuroscience, about parenting, about teaching and about what makes people successful.<br />You will meet some young people who deserve all of our respect and admiration.<br />Hopefully, you will be moved as well to do something, even a little tiny bit, to make a difference.
B001F1YBP8|4.0|I´d rather the sound in PCM 24 bits / 96 khz, but all in all<br />the graphic definition is great, and the sound is very good.<br />I like it.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Lets face it, Dark Shadows (the original soap opera) was a campy little oddity from 60s/70s day-time television. Nobody really expects much from it. This remake has much better production values (how could it not?) but the writers for the remake have actually come up with a very enjoyable tail about characters that you come to truly care about by the end of the movie. Treat yourself and give it a spin.
B004K00NMG|5.0|It was great to see this classic again on Blu-ray.  The decors are mesmerizing, using different painting techniques, combined with CGI.
0743270754|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. The author refernced diaries, newspapers, and other personal accounts from the people who knew him best to those who chanced meeting him or witnessed events. This book is not just an account of the events in history but gave the reader the chance to know Lincoln the man. The book made history come alive for me. I wished they required all schools put this on their reading lists.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises is the Mega-hit finale to The Dark Knight Trilogy.It contains everything fans of Christopher Nolan's Batman films expect & then some.<br /><br /> It's been eight long years since Harvey Dent/Two-face,Batman/Bruce Wayne,& Jim Gordon encountered the Joker(Heath Ledger in his final completed Oscar winning film role.The Dark Knight).Gotham City's biggest billionaire Bruce Wayne(Oscar winner Christian Bale, The Fighter)is a miserable recluse who spends all of his time in pain over the Death of his former love Rachel Dawes(Maggie Gyllenhaal,The Dark Knight, Secretary).When all of a sudden in comes a cat burglar(Anne Hathaway,love & other drugs,les miserables)into the new Wayne mansion,& The Masked terrorist know only as Bane(Tom Hardy from Inception). Bruce Wayne is in physical & emotional agony & even if he can rise from the depths of despair to become Batman one last time.It may not matter as Bruce Wayne/Batman encounters his great Challenges yet which include a broken spirit & the maniacal/physically overpowering(Bane)& his group of thugs.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises is one of the greatest comic book films ever made. It shows viewers just what a test of the human spirit is like in the world of Batman mythology.There are numerous political,social,economic,& Spiritual themes on display in this final Dark Knight motion picture.<br /><br />Will it win Oscars(who knows?) But TDKR is at worse a *** conclusion to probably the greatest comic book movie trilogy ever. It's also quite possibly the longest too.At 2hrs 45mins it's simply much too long & like it's prequel(The Dark Knight) far too violent for children & many teens/young Adult males. But for those of us willing & able to take the journey with Batman it's a hell of finish.<br /><br />Kudos to Christopher Nolan & Christian Bale on an amazing,awe-inspiring trilogy closer.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this item for a friend (30+ friend) and she absolutely LOVES it.  For any Dr. Who fan - it's an excellent purchase!
B0000CF35A|5.0|Powerage contains some of AC/DC's most catchy and resonating songs than some of their later albums. It still contains the usual blues-driven hard rock signature sound AC/DC has kept since their debut album. This album is extremely satisfied for me and would recommend to anyone. In addition, it is definitely one of their more approachable albums to date.
B000TGCR38|5.0|I think is a very good film. what i like it is the language. you can hear couple language in the film and the caracters are good.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|A Game of Shadows has a great connection with its predecessor. The story of the movie is relatively satisfied, but lacks the deeper connection later on with the movie. It seems as if the script writers had to rush through the story at later part of the movies. This is the only part of the movie I find to be unsatisfied. But the overall movie is still worth the money.<br /><br />The combo pack for this movies consists of dvd, blu-ray, and an ultraviolet copy. The digital copy of this pack is what I dissatisfied with the most with this movie. I personally would prefer the itunes digital copy that can be transferred to my ipad or other devices. But the ultraviolet copy would require users to go on to their websites to watch it.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Is a good film but im not crazy about it.  Actually I like Gijnn.. :) He is not talking to much but the best caracter (I think) ohhhh my best part is when the guy try to play on the flute some of the guys just brake it...but he is not give up...he took out frome the bag an other one :)
B003C1AL8K|5.0|Dangerous continues Jackson's mainstream success in the pop scene worldwide. It is a great follow-up of its predecessor Bad. Dangerous contains the elements of pop that have a distinctive sound that resonate with the 90s music. This clearly shows Jackson's awareness of making his music more approachable to the 90s musical scene. It is arguably one of his best albums of all time. But sadly, Dangerous is considered to be last of some of his great albums as he's subsequent albums were slowly declining in popularity.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it doesn't give you stuff to blow up your Tnt in creative.it is super awesome really and its a good game to
B001W63DX2|5.0|The Flight 666 shows the band's continuous energetic and enthusiastic worldwide performance even at an elder age. The setlist during their live shows contain much of their old materials that are reminiscent of the metal of the 1980s. It is impressive to see that this 80s bands continues to produce incredible shows and music resonating to the modern generation of metal lovers. An excellent and memorable item to own and definitely has a value several decades from now.
B00633W614|5.0|I just finished this book and loved it.  It had so many twists an I found it hard to put down.
B00140GXLK|5.0|Freak Styley contains its own distinctive tone than other RHCP albums even with the influence of funk. It is arguably one of their least popular and underrated albums in their entire discography. This Japanese import vinyl replica edition is a great collector's item for any of RHCP's fans out there.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|It's entertaining and an easy read, but I didn't like the way it ended. I'm curious to see if the movie ends the same way.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a terrific game on any pad. Hrs of fun.  My grandkids love it. Great entertainment when waiting in long lines
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I couldnt make it through the first few chapters.  Toro many characters, too many small subplots, and just boring.  I loved some of Follets other novels, just not this one.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire, she just has a knack for keeping the reader in all senses familiar with the emotions and thoughts of her main characters.  It would be a disaster if this book was NOT translated into film... what a piece of art!
B007XIC1GI|5.0|A great book, though I'm disappointed to read at the very end of the book that many of the people he mentions are composites, meaning that they're either combinations of people he knew, or were completely fabricated. Either way, a great glimpse inside the mind of a truly intelligent and disturbed genius. I've seen him live 6 times and have never been let down. I was at the Normal, IL show mentioned in the book. It was a powerful experience. The hundreds of Christians protesting outside actually gave him power the way Christians give Satan power by acknowledging him at all. Would you know about Satan had you not learn ed about him in church? Of course not. The same holds true for MM. Those who opposed him made him powerful. Ah, the folly of man.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you don't read book 2, you really dont get what James is trying to do with the trilogy.  Reading the entire series paints the picture, so i would not recomend stopping at book 1.  This was a great read.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this for my friend's birthday the other week and I knew how much she loves Doctor Who and thought this would be an excellent present! In fact, I was so excited about giving this to her and it got me into watching Doctor Who as well. To be honest I wanted to keep this for myself!<br />It works perfectly and she has so much fun carrying it around and keeps making the sonic screwdriver make sounds just like the show.<br />It's very simple to put together and the instructions were easy to read.<br />The 'invisible' ink works perfectly and it's just so fun to carry around!<br />A definite YES to any Doctor Who fans!

B004LWZWGK|3.0|I know i'll be getting lots of people who disagree but compared to the first two movies this one just falls short. And it is a Batman movie in which Batman himself rarely appears. It seems to me Chirstopher Nolan wanted to put too many storylines into this movie, it became a mess. There are things I liked about this movie... but when I left the theater I didn't have the same feeling as the previous films. I walk out of Batman Begins and the Dark Knight ready to turn right around and watch them again, Dark Knight left me a little flat. I lot of the movie focused on what the police were doing. This is a Batman movie I want to see Batman for more 20 minutes out of a nearly 3 hour movie. It should have been called Bruce Wayne Rises, it would have made more sense. Of course this movie is well acted and produced.... Directing??? I think Chirstopher Nolan tryed to payoff too many storylines. Visually amazing as always and the effects and the IMAX flimed stuff were beautiful. I'm a huge Comic book fan and I love that Hollywood has discovered Comics as a source for these amazing stories. But as we've seen with Superman Return, Green Lantern, The Fantastic Four and others that a rabid nerd following doesn't mean a success. I liked the Dark Knight rises far more than Green Lantern or Superman, but in my opinion last summer the Avengers kicked Batman's Ass. I love Batman a Character and I can't wait for the wheel to turn and bring us more.... Justice League Movie D.C. get crackin!
1451695187|4.0|I have never doubted that Heaven existed but this book gave me new insight.  My husband has recently died and I began the book with the hope that Dr. Alexander would tell me what Heaven is like.  However, his point was more how he came to realize that there is a Heaven.  The book was very interesting and although I did not find exactly what I was looking for, I enjoyed reading it.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I liked the story and the characters she met on the trail.  I'm not sure that I was convinced about her grieving and getting to know herself along the way.  Seemed like it was a smaller picture of her coming to maturity over a period of years.
0385535147|5.0|I am a big fan of John Grisham and this book did not disappoint.  He holds your interest to the very end and is a very fast read.
B003YGSLDA|5.0|I remember when I was little I kept asking my mom lot questions about Santa Claus like how do he travel around the world in one night? How does he get into people's house without them knowing he's there. My mom put the movie in and I watched and ever since I watched this movie, I fall in love with it and it showed me how Santa can be really magic and how he makes toys and all that stuff. I would recommend this movie for parents who kids are asking questions about Santa. I watch this movie ever since I been 8 years old!!! I am happy they still sell this movie since it is very old and still is my personal best Christmas movie of all times!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games were very realistic for me. Being a survivalist myself, I could identify with many of the characters. I loved the descriptions of the people, outfits, makeup, and surroundings. I especially liked Rue and would have used the same strategy as her for surviving the games.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Originally I thought this was going to be just about sex and this older guy taking advantage of a young woman but it wasn't.  Was there hot sex scenes yes but nothing worse than an R rated movie. I like that there is a story behind some of the main characters specifically Grey.  This does give way to the why in why he does what he does. I really liked the book and am working on the second and if it gives people a new zest in the sac or their relationship so be it.  People really shouldn't get so upset after all it is fiction and a book.  Make your own romance.  I love Ana she's strong and smart.  She does as she feels and is not a victim but a willing Participant.  Good book.
B00A5052YE|4.0|This is a very good CD and only 2 songs didn't rise to the level of this exceptional project.  If you appreciate Alicia's music, this is a MUST for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I like this book beyond the sexual part. It is very entertaining and easy to picture it while reading. I will recommended to those who romance and adventures.

B0006GAI6Y|5.0|I really, really enjoyed this movie.  I like to see couples dancing the classic styles of dancing which happened toward the end of this movie.  I liked the mixture of humor and human nature presented in this movie.  I liked the actors in their roles in this movie.  All of them seemed perfect for the role they portrayed.  This movie has become one of my all-time favorites.  I have watched numerous times and will do so many more times.
B009LUCPWQ|5.0|This isn't a comeback album by Graham Parker--he never went away, but I have to admit I lost track of him and haven't bought any of his music for too long a time. My loss, and yours too if you don't snap up \\"Three Chords Good.\\" To hear his legendary band The Rumour work with him on this stellar batch of songs, you wouldn't believe that they haven't recorded together since the early 1980s. In their heyday, The Rumour often found themselves compared to the greatest North American rock and roll outfit, The Band, and that is no less true today. These blue-collar Brits learned from listening to the best American rock and R+B, like Booker T and the MGs and the Stax sound, and earned their stripes in the bars and ballrooms of England and the US. No flash here, just finesse and fire, complementing Parker's scorching vocals, wittily trenchant lyrics, and journeyman rock and roll work ethic. I hear that GP and the Rumour will be featured in the new Judd Apatow movie--well, that ought to put Judd on the map!  Congratulations to Graham and the Rumour, to Judd, and to you if you buy this. Killer compositions include, but not limited to, \\"Coathangers,\\" \\"Last Bookstore in Town,\\" and \\"Snake Oil Capital of the World.\\" Graham maintains his sharp satirical eye and keeps it trained on some of his familiar targets, such as religious fanatics who lord it over people just trying to get through the day with a little dignity and pleasure. Three chords good? Make that great!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie because I have two sons that have been or are in the US Navy.  I like watching movies that star Niam Neeson, and I like watching movies with action.  I also enjoyed the humorous beginning with the chicken burrito.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really enjoy and value the opportunity to be able to track the battery life of the Kindle Fire for all functions.
B005DOKIYG|1.0|Very cheap looking material and really too small for a Kindle Fire.  I purchased this sleeve in blue, thinking it would be a good lower cost alternative ($19)  to the more expensive cover/stand ($35).  Bad idea.  Not only was it very unattractive and cheesy quality, it was also much too small for a Kindle Fire--it was much too tight a fit.  I returned it and purchased the more expensive  cover and stand since this was a gift purchase for my mom (80 yrs+).
0545425115|5.0|I read this book as my 10 year old has been asking to read it.  While I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I really don't think anyone under the age of 12 should be reading it.  The content and subject matter is not something that a child under 12 should even be thinking about. Yes, I know many kids play violent video games and watch reality TV but mine doesn't so it will be a few more years until I let her read the series.  I have now read most of book 2 and it is even more intense for young readers than book 1.

030716327X|4.0|I loved this book when I was little. I still love it. So I bought it for a friend who recently had a baby girl. I like the boxed set, but I do wish the book was a little more durable. It seems to be made of glossy cardboard bound with one of those comb bindings you see on booklets made at Kinko's / other copy stores. I just wish it was a little more durable looking, but I guess that's what you get for such a good price. I still love the product and would recommend it - but would recommend that new parents also get a wood-book version of this book once their baby is of mouthing age! :)
0156027321|5.0|I read this book many years ago and found that it awakened my imagination in ways that, until I saw the movie, was just that - my imagination to help with illustrating the story. I found my imaginary setting come to life when I saw the movie. The movie is just as wonderful as reading this tale about a young boy who lives and learns life's lessons in an extreme setting -

B00354YA2M|4.0|Bryson shows us around Australia in typical Bryson fashion. He can go from talking about the vastness and wonder of Australia to talking about the most minor irritations and the great thing is we love reading about the big things along with the small things.
0316182060|5.0|This story is great to begin with.  Gail Carriger puts all you need into a good story: action, intellect, supernatural aspects, romance, witty dialogue and memorable characters.  Although I don't usually enjoy manga I love this one.  I like the art.  It isn't too over-the-top obnoxious.  The style is more simplistic frou-frou, as I'd like to call it.  And the gentelmen are pretty freaking attractive.
B000JMKOI2|5.0|Bukowski brings us true grimy worlds of seedy bars and broken people. He does it with an unrelenting raw honesty and with no room for romanticism. Pure genius.
0374214913|4.0|This book is a quick read with a great plot, I really enjoyed the concept of the novel.  Very well written.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I recently got the album and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!! It has some of Christina Aguilera's best songs and, at this point in her career, is her best album as far as content and sales (for those of you who are concerned with numbers). The only song I don't really care for is &#34;Make Over.&#34; I feel she tried to dabble in Rock and failed. Sorry, but I feel her real genres are Pop, R&B, Soul, Jazz, and Latin. Otherwise, the album is a bold statement from a BOLD artist and is one of the best things I've ever bought with my money.
B007N8RULO|5.0|really have enjoyed this on my kindle.  easy to use but don't necessarily enjoy the ads. wouldn't mind a scrunch font for the longer lines.
140120841X|5.0|I recieved this 2 days ago and it was in perfect condition just like I ordered it. When they say &#34;new&#34;, they mean it. I am happy with this shipment as well. It arrived a day earlier than what was said and above all, the book is amazing. It may start slightly slow, but man does it hit hard when you keep reading. I love it, I love it, I love it.
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|I might have liked the original movie better if Arnold hadn't been cast as the star. Never liked anything he did. Hate his accent. He just sounds stupid every time he speaks.<br /><br />I suppose most special effects driven movies can only get better with time - new computer technology and much better programs for CGI.<br />This movie was much more sophisticated than the original, for the above reason, but also much better  casting First character Kate Beckinsale played that I actually hated and I found her ridiculous in the role. Come on hollywood, how long do you think people are going to swallow the beautiful 110 pound models kicking a$$ BS?. \\"Oh, I broke a nail! \\" If you're going to portrey a woman being a hands on killer, make it realistic. Make her a butch babe who kills from behind. This cuty-pie who stands toe to toe with a man in hand to hand combat is just ridiculous.  That happens so often in real life, doesn't it?<br />The one thing I really disliked about this movie is that it was shot in so much darkness and shadow. I hate how it makes me sit up and lean foreward, straining my eyes, trying to see what's going on in every dark scene. Like the original Alien movie. I like to see special effects in bright light where you can really see it all.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this was a really good book I don't know what I would do with out it ,*_*  my dad got this for me\\"!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Good, solid sci-fi movie that is epic in scope while still being &#34;small&#34; in cast and environment. It's also pretty to look at. There is plenty of hints at the alien movie that this springs from that fans of the original will pick up on, but you don't need to have that history to enjoy this movie. (it does have a similarly shocking moment in the middle that made my wife cringe... very &#34;scary&#34;) Point of fact; it was never marketed as an Alien prequel, though in the timeline it is... This is a stand-alone movie that may create a sequel in it's own right.<br /><br />I've not watched the 3D version as I don't have a proper TV. I did watch it in the theater and know that the 3D treatment was very good... I don't know how that translates to the smaller screen but the overall film was so well done I can't imagine it being poor in that regard.
1591396190|1.0|This book was initially written in 2005 and enjoyed success.  This is my first opportunity to read it.  Based on what I have observed, I think I will place a 5-year moratorium on reading any new book on management or business practice; it is much easier to separate the B.S. from the peanut butter that way.  Management has been around as long as societies have been around as a cursory reading of Genesis will attest.  Let us call management the world's second oldest profession, the first being, of course, agriculture.  (I hope you knew that.)  Since human nature does not appear to have changed, I think that management books should be read with particular suspicion, and in the case of this book, deservedly so.<br /><br />The central them of the book is that one should create new markets (blue ocean) rather than slugging it out in existing markets (the red ocean).  But most of the book is tautology.  For example, Kim and Mauborgne argue that one should use a \\"strategy canvas\\" to assess the competitive landscape.  The strategy canvas is a central tool in Blue Ocean.  It comprises a categorical abscissa on which are listed subjective customer benefits and an ordinate that measures the degree of achievement for each category.  If that sounds too non-quantitative to be exceptionally useful, it is.  How the authors can call this an analytic is beyond me.  But my main objection is that the categories themselves are nebulous, useless, or worse -- leading to an errant conclusion.  For example, let us revisit a case study the authors present regarding Cirque du Soleil.<br /><br />What categories should we place on the horizontal axis?  Well, before Cirque du Soleil existed, we may have placed items like ticket price, entertainment value, number of acts, quality of acts, act variety (animal, flying trapese, clown...) on our strategy canvas.  Now scoring each of those, Ringling Bros. was the best game in town.  The only problem was that customers didn't care about most of the items.  The 3-ring circus was distracting, the animals were smelly (or viewed as evidence of cruelty), the high priced performers were unknown to the average customer, etc.  The only reason most adults went to the circus was to take their children.  With that kind of strategy canvas, I would have been tempted to offer free school bus rides to kids as a major innovation.  Cirque du Soleil transformed the circus to an event for adults with no animals, a vague but central storyline, a theater-like experience, ethereal music, and beauty and artistry that celebrated human beings in motion.  When Kim and Mauborgne placed those items on the strategy canvas, then Cirque du Soleil became the clear winner.  But the analysis was done post hoc.  No one knew that such items should even be scored until the Cirque du Soleil strategy became successful.  Using an outcome to inform the question is question begging at its purest.<br /><br />Another objection I have is that the categories are open to manipulation.  Anyone who thinks that they will be able to use a strategy canvas to convince a refractory management to change their ways will just find themselves in an argument over what belongs on the category axis.  In the end, the strongest proponents -- the very ones steering the ship into the nighttime ice -- will be the ones deciding what categories should be scored.  And surprise, the status quo will win and be more justified than ever in staying the course.<br /><br />What I have learned over the years is that customer value is subjective and that innovation comes from visionaries (not the customer).  What one needs for success is for visionaries that know their markets and customers and are cogent and capable to persuade management to do the right thing.  And no book is going to create a visionary.  Visionaries are born, not made.  To paraphrase Robert Mitchum, one might as well go to school to learn how to be tall.  To find persuasive visionaries requires excellence in talent selection, because they need to come from the outside.  That fault lies with the refractory organization, not its internal visionaries.  Steve Jobs would have been fired from Apple long ago if he weren't their CEO.  In fact, he was fired even though he was their CEO.  But Apple wasn't worth anything without him.  Visionaries see the world a different way so it takes a superlative management team (or desperate one) to embrace them.<br /><br />Notwithstanding, the book finishes better than it starts with recommendations for how to navigate organizations to blue ocean in spite of themselves. To that end, Kim and Mauborgne have the following suggestions.  Overcome the cognitive hurdle by exposing upper management to the pain of the customer through direct engagement.  Mobilize a critical mass of resources by horsetrading with other leaders.  Find the critical mass of managers (\\"kingpins\\") who will ally with you, and enlist their support early.  Once you have enlisted support of key management, make measures visible to all (\\"fishbowl\\" management; I would call this aligning incentives.) As for executing the strategy, persuade downstream personnel using a \\"fair process\\" that openly engages employees, shows them why the new strategy is in their best interest, answers their questions, and resolves their fears.<br /><br />These are contained in Chapters 7 and 8; and besides reading the Chapter 1 for context, these are the only chapters worth reading.

1451539053|4.0|Well, this is only the second work of fiction I have reviewed and the first of its genre that I have ever read. As many may know, the novel is much different than the movie adaptation.<br /><br />In the novel, Frankenstein's \\"daemon\\" or \\"monster\\" is highly articulate, intelligent, and agile. A creature standing eight foot tall, he scales mountains with superhuman ease and endures temperatures and hardships that would fell a mortal man. Created by Victor Frankenstein from overly large parts (for ease of construction), the good doctor is instantly horrified by his creation and immediately abandons it. Forced to experience life without reference, and rebuffed by humanity, the creature experiences the psychological pain of being rejected for nothing more than his grotesque appearance. Over time he learns to speak and read by secretly observing a family as they teach a newly arrived immigrant the ways of society and language. He first introduces himself to the family's blind patriarch and performs many secret good deeds for them. But disaster soon follows when the sighted members of the family discover the monster and drive him away. This, along with other disastrous encounters with humanity, vow him to destroy his creator, Victor Frankenstein.<br /><br />However, in Chapter 10 we learn of the monster's harrowing life experiences through his own first-person narrative. And though he has unintentionally suffocated Victor's young brother, the monster vows never to kill again, if only the good doctor will make for him a bride to ease his loneliness. Although conflicted, Dr. Frankenstein reluctantly agrees and travels from Geneva to England to complete this work. However, in the midst of his second creation he sees the first monster jeering with delight in the moonlight. Frankenstein contemplates the horror he might unwittingly unleash upon mankind were he to create another terrible beast. At that thought, he destroys the half-made bride, enraging the monster who promises to destroy his creator on his wedding day. This he does by murdering his family members one by one, beginning with Dr. Frankenstein's new wife. At the last, Victor Frankenstein succumbs to grief and exposure near the arctic circle, where he has chased the monster with a view to destroy him.<br /><br />In the last pages, the monster encounters the ship's captain who has befriended Dr. Frankenstein in the last days of his life upon encountering him on an ice floe in polar waters. Indeed, the entire story is told through the captain's letters to his sister. The book ends with the monster confronting the captain and recounting his extreme sadness and conflict at the death of his creator. The monster leaves the captain unharmed after the creature reveals his intention to commit suicide by immolation for all the evil he has caused.<br /><br />By modern horror standards, the book is quite tame. Yet it leaves the reader to contemplate the unintended consequence of mankind's overreach into the affairs of God. The book is all the more remarkable considering that Mary Shelley wrote it after she turned 18 years of age, finishing it and seeing it published at age 19. Despite this, the vocabulary and polished textual style are those of a person easily twice her age, and her knowledge of the Bible, Milton and other works of literature and poetry are all the more remarkable. The book was originally written as a warning against 19th century galvanism; at the time electricity was being applied to animate corpses and many wondered at the possibility of artificial life and contemplated its theological consequences. This debate that has been renewed today in the wake of the abject failure of embryonic stem cell research (in contrast to adult stem-cell research which has shown many benefits). If good lessons are best taught through good stories, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein surely deserves to be read.

0060930349|4.0|\\"I am not a history buff, but *A History of the American People* is the best and most engaging history book I have ever read. The book is 1088 pages including 84 pages of end notes and a 28-page index but, like a good movie, seems much shorter. The book is organized into 8 parts: 1. A City on a Hill (Colonial America, 1580-1750), 2. That the Free Constitution Be Sacredly Maintained (Revolutionary America, 1750-1815), 3. A General Happy Mediocrity Prevails (Democratic America, 1815-1850), 4. The Almost Chosen People (Civil War America, 1950-1870), 5. Huddled Masses and Crosses of Gold (Industrial America, 1970-1912), 6. The First International Nation (Melting Pot America, 1912-1929), 7. Nothing to Fear but Fear Itself (Superpower America, 1929-1960), and 8. We Will Pay Any Price, Bear Any Burden (Problem-Solving, Problem-Creating America, 1960-1977). This book was recommended to me by a friend (Thank you, Dr. Brown) as a fascinating read, and it actually was.<br /><br />Nowadays, we have large scale revisionist history promulgated by know-nothings. No doubt it will soon be legal to marry your dog all the while claiming that the U.S. Constitution prohibits otherwise. Perhaps I shouldn't use the term \\"revisionist history\\" since there is a better verb. I should know because I \\"revised history\\" plenty of times as a child. When revisionist history was uncovered in my home I was spanked. That's when I learned that to revise history and to lie are the same thing.<br /><br />Today, the original intent of the authors of the Constitution is counting for less and less. However, as Johnson's book amply documents, America was always a religious nation and religion in general (and Protestant Christianity in particular) was and remains a powerful and socially stabilizing influence. For that reason, America very quickly developed into a safe harbor for all religions. This uniquely American attitude was fostered by nearly limitless supply and unfettered competition for goods and services. In these respects, Johnson shows that the United States is still the freest country despite its many dark times -- also amply documented.<br /><br />My favorite section of the book is Part 8 -- with Americans being highlighted as problem solvers extraordinaire. Having lived in Europe, I know that the desire to change things for the better is quickly opposed for Europeans at an early age -- there is simply too much bureaucracy to overcome and one can only bang one's head against the wall for so long before giving up. That is not to say that truly extraordinary entrepreneurs cannot come from European soil -- Sir Richard Branson comes to mind -- but the process is much tougher outside the U.S. than inside it. For example, I can start a wallpaper hanging business tomorrow with $100 for a business license. There are no guilds to join, no apprenticeships to complete, and nothing to stop me from succeeding (or failing) but my own skill. Compared with most nations, this is a completely unique freedom, and like all freedoms, it has an upside and a downside.<br /><br />Lately, however, America has undergone a revolutionary and foreign change whereby incompetent companies (e.g., General Motors) have been rescued and corrupt unions have been rewarded. However, if Johnson is right, America will not suffer the \\"too big to fail\\" mentality for long before issuing a major correction. The 2010 mid-term election will be the perfect test of this book's prescience.<br /><br />This book was originally copyright in 1977 and is already out of print. However, out of print books are easier (and cheaper) than ever to obtain with a host of booksellers dedicated to the art. Even Amazon.com hosts this activity.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I didn't care for the writing story at all.  It was clever toward the end, but I really had to force myself to get through the first half.
0385528752|5.0|Switch is a book about managing change by the Heath brothers (Chip and Dan). Chip is a professor at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University and Dan is a Senior Fellow at Duke University' Social Entrepreneurship center. The two have teamed up before -- in 2007 they released their critically acclaimed Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die. This latest effort focuses less on the stickiness of the idea and more on the change process itself. What should a change agent do to implement lasting change in a hard-headed organization that desperately needs it?<br /><br />The book is organized into eleven chapters in three parts: Part 1, Direct the Rider; Part 2, Motivate the Elephant; and Part 3, Shape the Path. The titles come from a vivid metaphor by University of Virginia psychologist Jonathan Haidt. In his book, The Happiness Hypothesis, Haidt likens a person to a rider on an elephant. The rider is the rational side of a person: the part that tells him to eat better, exercise more, and stop procrastinating, for example. The elephant is the emotional side that doesn't want to work to lose weight or exercise and would rather stay put; let's say willpower vs. won't-power; but why should that be? Whatever is autonomous and ingrained by habit belongs to the elephant. The rider is theoretically in control, but it is exhausting to continually tug on the reins and direct the stubborn elephant. Eventually the rider relents and the elephant goes back to doing what he's always done. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Before going much farther, you should know that two things separate Switch from so many other glib books about change: first, the book has a very solid psychological basis. Despite its accessible style, scores of major psychological findings and studies are reported and undergird the book's practical formulae for change. Second, Switch is not a self-help book. I have no doubt that the book could be used in this way, but it is really a book about how to change things. It is primarily directed toward organizational change, though its principles are much broader. And there are many surprises.<br /><br />The first big surprise occurs in the very first chapter.<br /><br />\\"We know what you're thinking -- people resist change. But it's not quite that easy. Babies are born every day to parents who, inexplicably, welcome that change. Yet people don't resist this massive change -- they volunteer for it. In our lives we embrace lots of big changes. So there are hard changes and there are easy changes. What distinguishes one from the other?\\"<br /><br />And the surprises keep coming. Like the two researchers who dramatically and permanently got folks to reduce their saturated fat intake. Or the doctor who saved over 100,000 lives and counting in American hospitals on schedule (18 months) by getting thousands of doctors and organizations to change their practices. Or the American who went to Vietnam and changed the face of malnutrition. Or the student who saved an endangered species in a Caribbean country that didn't give two hoots about it.<br /><br />What do all these stories have in common? For one, none of these change agents had the sufficient budget or authority to succeed; yet, they did. How? Every one of them gave clear rational direction to the rider by finding the bright spots, scripting the critical moves, and clearly pointing to the end goal. All of them motivated the elephant by emotionally connecting with it, and they shrunk the apparent change by carefully communicating progress. They refused to underestimate their people. Instead they provided them with a newfound identity that let them to grow into the challenge. But there was more.<br /><br />As the authors note, many times what looks like resistance is really confusion or even the result of misaligned incentives. That's why the path needs to be shaped by making manageable changes to the environment, building sound habits, rallying the herd, and reinforcing the new habit until it becomes a way of life.<br /><br />Well, maybe that sounds like a lot of work. I think it is. But speaking from firsthand experience, it will be a labor of love. And if your heart is not in the change and you do not think you can derive reward from the process, perhaps you are selling yourself short -- or, maybe you're the wrong person to lead the change and you should stop kidding yourself. And perhaps that is what I like most about this book. It does not promise a panacea. It tells it like it is without the jingoism that has become the substance of many change management essays. If you are leading organizational change, the book will provide a solid prescription for achieving lasting results because Switch uses real research, reports real experiences, and provides real guidance. Here, my recommendation is enthusiastic.ng the new habit until it becomes a way of life.<br /><br />Well, maybe that sounds like a lot of work. I think it is.

Ok, ok....<br /><br />They did save the best for last, \\"Riders on the Storm\\" - without a doubt, a time-capsule classic, thru and thru, with a relevatory electric piano keeping it a-flow. Even the embarrassingly peurile phrase \\"dog with a bone\\" works in the arrangement. Listening at home in 1972, over the intercome system me and my Dad installed in our Weehawken, N.J., home, I was floored. Don't know why I did not buy the single.

0307341577|4.0|Dark. Disturbing. Chaotic. Crazy.<br /><br />This past week I've been on a Gillian Flynn kick, ever since a whim led me to SHARP OBJECTS and I found myself undeniably hooked. I caved and bought DARK PLACES despite my ban on books not from the thrift store (and GONE GIRL is on its way). I tore into it and immediately ran into a little problem...<br /><br />I was...disappointed?<br /><br />It's hard to accept when a book you thought would be amazing fell short of being amazing. DARK PLACES has an unfortunate issue - it drags in the area of 75 pages toward the beginning, 75 pages that carry on for what seems like forever, filled with unneeded story that doesn't contribute to the story. But once you get over this hump, and once these random aspects begin to make sense, the story picks up and sends you down that trademark Gillian Flynn roller coaster of bleakness, darkness, meanness, evilness, and nessy-ness.<br /><br />In DARK PLACES, we follow Libby Day, the survivor of a horrific crime that took the lives of her mother and two sisters. Her brother was convicted of the crimes and sent to prison. She's been living off the money given to her by well-wishers she takes advantage of - or tries to, at least. She supplements this by stealing things for the thrill of it. Twenty five years later, though, she is tracked down by a club that wants to prove Ben's innocence. This leads Libby down a dark road back into a time she wanted to forget, back to her brother, the possible suspects, and the night where she almost died.<br /><br />If you haven't read my review of SHARP OBJECTS, you might want to browse over it to get an idea of what you might be expecting from Gillian Flynn if you're a newbie. I don't know how Ms. Flynn does it, but her stories are some of the darkest, most disturbing tales you'll ever read. The characters are depraved and dark, and even the heroes have their own disturbing secrets that rear their ugly heads.<br /><br />Libby is one of the most flawed protagonists I've ever met. After losing her family, she's become quite evil herself. She steals, she lies, she hurts. She spent the rest of her childhood being passed around like rotten meat. But I must admit, I kind of liked her. Despite her flaws, she had determination.<br /><br />The cast of characters around her, though, isn't as fully fleshed out. Her brother Ben in particular seemed rather lifeless. The motivations for others were never really fleshed out. I did, however, find myself enjoying the money-grubbing Runner, Libby's destitute father. But the bubbles of suspicion kept me hanging on, analyzing every character for clues, and even with that, I didn't really guess the killer. When we got to the end, finally picking back up from the slow parts, I ripped through the pages desperately for clues and hints and then finally got to the end and went...<br /><br />\\"OHHHH!\\"<br /><br />The conclusion seems a little rushed, with many threads left open, but that's okay with this story. It's not supposed to be happy. It's just supposed to be an ending to a thrill ride of a story that takes us across three states and 25 years. It's a story about the darkness of humanity, the bleakness of poverty, the aftereffects of crime on a person and the damaged inflicted on them. To me, it was also about self-discovery - realizing that after all this time that you might have been wrong is a powerful subject.<br /><br />I wish there had been more about the investigation of the murders and the trial that convicted Ben, but I can see why Flynn omitted that. The writing was spot on and descriptive, just the way I like it. This story was almost perfect, with the exception of the slowness and pacing issues. Flynn has proven herself to be one of my new favorites and I cannot wait to dive into GONE GIRL very soon.<br /><br />VERDICT: Although it's a bit slow at times, DARK PLACES is a worthy addition to Gillian Flynn's works.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|After watching all my friends and their children play this game on their Apple products, I was very excited when they came out with a version for the Kindle Fire. However, after playing it for quite some time, if I were to pause a game and then continue it from where I left off, the graphics and effects were very delayed and made it difficult to maneuver and play. Then, my store where my purchase new characters and powerups all of a sudden just stopped working and now whenever I click on it, ot returns my to my beginning screen for the Kindle Fire saying there was an error. I love the game and still continue to play it, but it is a bit frustrating to be collecting all the coins for no reason. A new update with the glitches fixed would be greatly appreciated.
B004ZJZQ5G|4.0|I guess I am spoiled by the Colin Firth version or presentation. This presentation they plow through, talk fast and spend more time making faces. However the wide long shots of the country side are impressive (especially in Blu-ray). I have seen some to the houses in a TV production on \\"Great Houses of Britain\\". However Donald Sutherland is a good contributor as Mr. Benet.<br /><br />Oh Great Scott, forget about what I said in the first paragraph as the presentation finally picks up as everyone gets over the initial deceptions. So do not give up on this movie too early. Finally we get the highs and lows that we planned on.<br /><br />It is not the easiest thing to tell the story as by the time you view this presentation you should already be familiar with Jane Austen. If not we do not eat to give too many things away. To say that the Bennet family of all daughters will lose their meager estate at the passing of the father. Only a male can inherit property.<br /><br />So it is time to marry off the daughters. As the story unfolds you will understand the title of the story. The main focus is on the banter between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy surrounded by others that are also posturing. Is there opportunity that all well be well in the end or will the whole thing unravel?<br /><br />For people not acquainted with Jane Austin you will see that she is not an obscure writer of only a hand full of novels but someone that was taken from us too soon.<br /><br />Screenplay by Deborah Moggach. We have not heard the last from her yet.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|pair it with the Clearly app in Chrome, and you can easily create a personal reference library. pretty useful. bookmarks, lists are simple, too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wonderful is all I can say. This book will have you on the edge of your seat. Great book. A must read!!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Latest update crashes when:<br />1. Getting new quests from the characters, sometimes<br />2. When scrolling past the first two pages of items in the store, consistently<br /><br />Also, when app open, there is a dialog asking if you want to recover lost crops for $1, even if you have nothing planted!<br /><br />Used to be my favorite game, but these problems render it almost unplayable. Will update rating to a 5 when bugs are fixed, but must give current version a 1.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The up side is that the visual effects are brilliant, the casual physics (nobody has a believable explanation for inter stellar flight) are believable.<br /><br />The story isn't any too bright. The characters have a worst case horror movie case of the dumbs. Faced with an unknown alien snake like creature what do we do? Well assume that it's friendly and try to pet it of course. It just goes on stupid decision after stupid decision. But in the end it's sci-fi and it's not like there is any way it could really be expected to reflect real life? But do people have to be so entirely and utterly dumb?
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love this the descriptions to detail and characters are very good can't wait to see the movie, but waiting till I finish the other two
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app  is really fin on long car trips pr just when ur super bored but its not the mort fin app in the world its alright.
0553108034|5.0|as usual good book he keeps you wanting more - as the first and the 3rd and so on, this is the first time I've read George Martin - look forward to his other books
B009YP9L7U|3.0|While the characters were fun to read about the story tended to lag a bit in certain parts. It was also completely focused on their relationship and we didn't really get to see anything of their lives. Such as what type of work Megan did that allowed her to take off for three months.
0547884591|5.0|Having read Tim's previous two books I felt I had a good idea what to expect this time around.  I was pleasantly surprised by the how he deconstructed cooking as well as several other activities in new and innovate ways.  Look forward to enjoying the fruits of his teaching by cooking my family and friends numerous healthy and easy to prepare dishes.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|a must have for anybody that enjoys listening to shania twain music. enjoy this cd a great deal and listen to it all the time
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Love the interpretations and songs by this duo. Nice to have something different in my collection. Will be new lyrics in my brain for sure.
B009EAO38C|5.0|The piano guys have a gift for making music!!  They take modern and classical music and put it together into an album that everybody can enjoy.  Our youngest child is 6 and she always complains when we listen to instrumental music, but she frequently asks to listen to the Piano Guys!  If you haven't seen their youtube videos, make sure to check those out too!!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|What a great movie. Makes you think to wait before you speak. Saying words can not be taken back. I am glad it had a Happy ending
B009SQRC9E|5.0|Our whole family enjoyed this movie and our kids have already watched it multiple times!  It has lovable, funny characters and a great Christmas message!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|Not what I expected of this Rowling. I loved her Harry Potter and expected more here. Very disappointed in this one.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|This is by far the worst of all the Transformer movies.  Every scene with Shia and his blowup girlfriend is a slap in the face to modern women.  After watching for thirty minutes, I realized I had wasted enough of my time and stopped the film.  If I had paid for this, I would have thrown a temper tantrum until I got a full refund.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Alot of people complain not about the gameplay;but the choice to buy gems.This is a fun;addicting game.A app like this cost alot of money.And when you purchase a money package the developers make up for the lost money.All in all this a good app but minus a star for all of those annoying pop ups;and there not just ads.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|One of the best TV Series I have seen.  Fast paced, great writing, great acting by a talented cast on a very timely subject.  Really worth watching!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I can keep up with weather anywhere my loved ones are.Or check forcast for my travel plans! Love it.One touch, accurate information. All you need for the best forecast. Quick weather check or full week.

0143113100|1.0|No one here mentioned extensive and detailed list of torture that animals has been subjected in order to provide us with this \\"research\\". Monkeys, apes, dogs, rats, mice, cats, chicken, ducklings - no one is safe from opening their skulls open, cutting the eyelids of or electrocution inside their brains. While this book affirms the \\"progress\\" it also show no sign of remorse or at least an acknowledgement for all those innocent creatures whose lives has been torn away from.  I bet that many readers have their pets sitting next to them while going through this book.    [...]    try above link for the sake of sanity. Playing God makes people forget about their humanity sometimes.

B004EKCNMA|5.0|This is becoming a Christmas tradition around our house. it incorporates some of our favorite actors into beautifully created world with amazing digital animation. If you haven't seen this and like the story, it is definitely worth a look.
0345803493|5.0|The book was very good and I would recommed this book to my friends. J.D. Robb is a good writer and story teller and I will continue reading her books
B007J4T2G8|2.0|If you are young (15-25), you may relate and appreciate the &#34;naughty&#34; side of this book.<br />I'm in my 30s... and I had a hard time getting over the improbable plot of the story AND the writting.  Now if someone decided to read my comments and find my mistakes (typos), that's okay; I'm not a published author.  :)<br />There was just too much repetition and it got annoying, IMO.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|My 8 year daughter loves this series!  She is often laughing out loud, and has read the books over and over.
B004WE01YA|5.0|It came the next day and was waiting in my mail box! This movie is fantastic. If younever saw it as a kid, you didn't have a childhood.
B0006Z2LH4|5.0|Cube Zero is a 2004 Canadian psychological thriller/horror film, written and directed by Ernie Barbarash. It is the third film in the Cube film series, but is a prequel to the first film. Even though the first two films take place almost entirely within the maze, Cube Zero takes place in both the interior and exterior of the cube, making significant use of outdoor scenes. This movie explains the origins of the Cube and the people that control it.
B008KOMMTA|4.0|The Box of it is so detail you can fell its like its an actual small ship, the art book is awesome and theres alot of stuff ull enjoy!<br />I recommend this for Titanic lovers
B008MJC6ZS|4.0|Testament's last album, Damnation of Formation, is hard to top.  But if you are a Testament fan like I am, this album rocks!  Maiden fans will like hearing the Powerslave remake - well done Testament style.  Or should I say Chuck Billy style, because the vocals growl!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|kind of hokey. but very enjoyable. wish there were more game apps like this one. nice bonuses. cant beat free too ads are not bothersome at all
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Nice laptop stand that is sturdy and well made. Recommend this for anyone who wants to free up desk space.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I'm fairly new to fantasy, but read the first four books of Game of Thrones and was looking for something along those lines. This book did NOT disappoint! A very immersive read from the start. This book has a rich world with themes of history, magic, mystery, coming of age, morality, religion, war, friendship, love, honor, survival, and more.<br />I don't want to reveal too much, but basically this is a really well-written story that flowed effortlessly and that I really enjoyed.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is great and very easy to use.  I already have it for my iphone so there was no question getting it for my kindle.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|I love the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's classic, epic and full of heart. It never gets old to me!
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Very good packaging! The cd arrived in mint condition and my daughter will go crazy this Christmas when she opens it!! Thank you very much!!
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game for wasting mindless hours in an airplane.  Helps with your hand eye coordination.  I have no complaints with this product.
B00008OE4W|5.0|This movie was just as fun as I remember it being when I first saw it in the theater in high school. While some of the technology is obviously dated by this point, it's still very enjoyable. The cast is perfect. Robert Redford is awesome as the main character, David Straitharn is perfect as always, Poitier and Aykroyd have minor roles but are funny playing off each other, and of course River Phoenix is great as well. The only performance I didn't love was Ben Kingsley, something too stiff about him in this one. Overall, this is a fun heist comedy, definitely recommend it if you haven't seen it before.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great little app for checking the weather.  As an avid skydiver, I like how it gives wind speed and direction on the main screen.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Great price on a blue ray triology awesome movie set!!  This is a Christmas gift for my nephew.  He loves Woody but doesn't have any of the movies.  He's going to be so happy!
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Fun little app.  I can land on a carrier but it kicks my butt on the airfield.  I think it is suppose to be the other way around.
0345347951|5.0|But reading the back, it's awesome. I see it happening already. Bought it as a gift for a friend and he'll tell me how it is
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|Kicks my butt so it isn't much fun.  The reaction time of my kindle fire HD makes it hard to use.
1400031354|5.0|I have read all the books in this detective series. They are fun and give you a good sense of what Botswana is like. I heard Alexander McCall speak 2 years ago. He is so witty in person, and I believe the proceeds from these books go to support an orphanage in Botswana.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game for wasting mindless hours in an airplane.  Helps with your hand eye coordination.  I have no complaints with this product.
B000HF0ISC|5.0|This movie is great and illuminates the sexual abuse that no child wants to talk about. Revenge in this movie is the best.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I saw this movie three times in the theater, and when it became available on dvd, bought a copy for myself and one for my sister.  I love Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, and the performances by the other actors are all solid and memorable.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|It was really cool! My son loved it and it kept him entertain for a long time. It is just great for kids.
B0047WJ11G|5.0|Great movie! Action, suspense, and internal struggle from the main character. I would definitely recommend buying it for your collection.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Very easy to use and understand. I especially like the ability to move and view files from the other computers on my network. I also use Box and Google Drive and this file mgr also includes the ability to access these. I would pay for this.
0374275637|5.0|This book will help you understand the brain and its two thinking systems. Lots of great anecdotes and explanations. It's a long read, but completely worth it.
B00000FBRE|5.0|Let's Talk About Feelings, my second favorite CD by Lagwagon is just reall great, this album brings out the poppier melodic sound Lagwagon makes, which is AWESOME! This is a must have if you love Lagwagon. <3
B0047DVHV2|3.0|Reading about Keith Richards life was interesting.  Keith took the road less travelled but one thing that shone through was his committment to family and friends.  Keith's life struggle showed his love of music, his willingness to do whatever it took to be the best in his profession and to acknowledge the achievements of those who went before him, the leaders in rhythm and blues music.  At times the story seemed a little repetitive but it was Keith's life written in his own words, and life can be repetitive at times, until you learn the lesson...and he did learn lots of life lessons.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Cant stop listening to every song on this album.  I want them to make new music all the time!  Everyone should buy this album!
B008MEM24S|5.0|this is a great game! i love it. easy to use too. fun for all ages. and you cant beat tue price either. you really get into it. its addictive.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer must have had a mortgage payment due, to agree to star in this drivel.  Corny beyond belief. All the good lines (and there were only a few) were all shown in the trailer.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Can't wait for the sequel!  Once I starting reading I didn't want to stop until I finished reading the book.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|So many improbable things going on here. Too many to list. The cartoonish costumes worn by the Stanley Tucci and everyone else watching the Hunger Games, set the tone immediately for me. I couldn't take any of this drivel seriously.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Love, love, love this movie.  Seen umpteen times and never get tired of it.  We like to have it playing while we decorate the tree.
B0020M99LC|5.0|Loved Daniel Craig.  Saw this when it first came out.  Music seems a little dated now, especially after hearing the soundtrack created for Skyfall.  Eva Green's ridiculous fake accent was so hard to listen too. Plus she kept losing it throughout the movie.  She sounded more like a real person in her role in Dark Shadows.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|I wanted this movie to be a lot better than it was. Mostly it felt a bit flat, a bit thin -- like it wanted to be deep but didn't quite get there. Nicely made film though, and good acting.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Got this mainly to entertain my grandsons and sons.  They are crazy for it!  They find it challenging and entertaining.  It was an affordable game that was worth it.
B005S39YGU|5.0|I've heard people dismiss Big Bang Theory as 'nerd blackface', where the characters are a parody of reality that plays on the most ridiculous stereotypes of the broad characters.  While this may be true to some degree, I submit that there is no other milieu of scripted television (doctors, nurses, law enforcement, military, national intelligence, students, business, etc) where the same is not true as well.<br /><br />Also, the show has done a good job of remaining fresh, and has introduced new and solid characters over the years (Bernadette, Amy Farrah Fowler).  The writing is top-notch, and although it may have lost a half-step in the later seasons, it's still fantastically funny to me.<br /><br />I was actually introduced to the show by my college-aged daughter, who insisted that I would love it.  Given the generational differences in taste that are inherent in situations like this, I presumed that I would sit patiently through a few episodes before letting her know that although I could see how she might like it, it just didn't click for me, but that was NOT the case.  I immediately loved it, have now caught up and watched every episode, and look forward to each new one.<br /><br />Note that we also got my wife's mother hooked on it, and she has run through all the episodes as well.  So, in our family, The Big Bang Theory is a bonding event for three generations.  Those are rare, and are a testament to the quality of the show.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very surprising ending. It kept me guessing as he traveled around from place to place with people. Would rather criminals pay for their crime though at the end.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great show, set in current-day London, that updates the Sherlock Holmes story to the time of mobile phones, DNA testing, and the internet, without losing the Holmes-ian nature of the character.  Benedict Cumberbatch (great name!) is fantastic in the role, and fully inhabits the tortured-abrasive-genius aspects of the Holmes character.  Martin Freeman (Hot Fuzz, Love Actually) makes an engaging and dogged Watson.<br /><br />The stories tend towards the fantastical, but how could they not?  They are over the top, but not ridiculously so, and the effects and action sequences are not the point of the show.  It's character and plot driven, and while each episode has a self-contained case (or cases, as the case or cases may be), there are also ongoing story-lines that cross the boundaries of episodes (and seasons).<br /><br />We are now waiting very impatiently for the next season to become available - highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|love all the books for mature audience and open minded people only either you hate the story or you love it and i loved it and my husband read it too :)
B0095XPZBC|3.0|Star Trek Next Generation season 1 Blu-ray was completely done in-house by CBS Digital and was a fantastic remastering effort. Unfortunately season 2 was done by HTV and looking at the screenshots and reading the reviews, the remastering effort, especially the planets are not of the same quality and do not meet the same high standard as those done by CBS Digital on season 1. Also excessive grain reduction has been applied to certain live action shots. Fortunately CBS Digital are remastering season 3 and HTV are having no further involvement with the remastering confirming their subpar effort. Sadly the damage has been done and unless CBS Digital go back and remaster season 2 then this subpar effort has permanently tarnished season 2. I have cancelled my preorder of season 2 which I was really looking forward to because I will not reward mediocrity and await season 3. I hope CBS Digital change their decision to outsource the even numbered seasons and remaster all remaining seasons in-house.<br /><br />After watching the fantastic new trailer for the remastered Season 3, its even more obvious what a substandard effort was performed by HTV on this remastering.<br /><br />Acknowledgement taken from the comments. Added 2 stars due to the extras and the live action remastering.<br /><br />CBS when all seasons are finished please go back and correct Season 2 so there is consistent quality across all 7 seasons.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|The adapter works great with my android tablet and ultrabook for reading my phones microsdhc. Its very handy to have when I want to put movies on either mobile device or to listen to music on my TV.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Wasted too much time trying to change the location. Couldn't change to Albany NY. I will not spend any more time with it.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Folks &#34;water&#34; was not a fluk. Gregory porter is the real deal. This one's even better and thats saying something. Lookinf forward to listening  to this guy for years. Please do something good for yourself and buy this. Music as its meant to be heard. Get It!
B0091REZMW|4.0|it is fun to play but its hard to figure out how to use all of the extra stuff.  and hard to get diamonds.  still fun to play though.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|I listen to alot of music,:been listening to jazz for over 30 years. Most male vocalists who sing straight ahead jazz are lucky score get one or two great songs per CD. This guys hits it out of the park everytime. The smooth baritone, insightful lyrics and the soulful message are unreal. I can't wait to catch him live. lookout kurt ;gregs coming! I havn't not played this is at least 3 weeks. Its that good.
B0065CCM76|5.0|This album is absolutely kickin it !! Love listening to it, that takes me back to a time when music was real music, and had feeling.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|This book took me to various countries at the time around the second world war and I felt for the people making their way no matter what it took.
B006GLLXXK|5.0|Probably the best vampire series ever, I must say it beats Vampire Diaries by a landslide.  The plot is not predictable at all.  Great.
B008AX1HD8|3.0|A book for people who would like to know more about Australia.<br />There must have been a list of Aussie things to be included and the story incorporates them all.<br />I am a Jo Nesbo fan.
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|I deleted this off my kindle because I just don't understand how it works. Wish I could find an easier navigation system.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I have absolutely loved this show from the very first episode and will definitely be watching every season for as long as this show lasts.
B000V86OKG|5.0|i have watched all the seasons up to the current one and i love them all. its really easy to watch these again because there is so much that happens you forget a lot. highly recommended. the seller was quick to ship and gave a good price. very happy with this purchase.

B007N5YIUS|5.0|Awesome physics-based game.  A really good way to step things up from the base game.  I like the variety in the super-powers the birds have gotten too.
0307895475|4.0|Very detail assistance with this huge game world.  Gives you many great tips from start to finish, especially with determining the character you want to start with which is an important factor for certain pieces of gameplay..
B004DLPXAO|3.0|It's fine I guess.  It might make more sense if I had an actual Kindle device from Amazon, But alas I do not.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Does not work. Youtube videos/mp3's used to be easy to rip. Alas no more.I would pay good money for something that worked.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Great app, simple, everything I need.  Can't even think of anything to suggest to improve on it in any way.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are the most comfortable and best sound headphones that I have found.  They are far superior to ear buds, and they are comfortable so that I can wear them for an extended period of time.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I've waited for this movie on Blu ray forever. I went to the movies to see it, and w/ my home set up now, it's the cats a$$. I've kept track of all the actors, and many of them are doing well, especially Fillion. I've seen it so many times, my wife won't watch it w/me anymore !
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is the most fun, most intriguing game that I have found for my Fire.  The drawings are superior, and the taunting dialogue is hilarious.  The puzzles themselves are so much fun to figure out.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Considering its a Pixar movie, I had higher expectations on the story, which is dull and boring at times and predictable for the most.<br />Visually is a stunning movie, but Pixar excels at the technical details.<br />Other than that I was kind of disappointed.
0316228532|4.0|I'm obsessed with the Harry Potter series. I've read each of those books more times then is ok to admit. I grew up with them, and because of this I feel a little like I know J.K. Rowling. I sometimes refer to her as \\"Jo\\" and I was so excited that she was writing a new book. In my mind, the worst case scenario was that it would be a total flop and she would go back to writing Harry Potter novels.<br /><br /> From the start, I was hooked. Casual Vacancy was as un-Potterish as it is possible to be. J.K. Rowling writes characters that swear like sailors and deal with bus ride erections. WHAT? Who is this author??<br /><br /> Casual Vacancy has the most unusual and dynamic cast of characters, each of them tragic in their own way. This is not a happy romp through an idyllic town but rather a town masking the war brewing underneath the surface. No, not Voldemort, this war is about ideals, money, and hidden desires. In a sense, this book is about the Dursley's life, if Harry Potter did not exist. In fact, you might think Dudley Dursley is a much sweeter kid than Fats, one of the major players in Casual Vacancy.<br /><br /> If you can muddle through how quickly Jo switches character point of view, sometimes mid-paragraph, and begin to make sense of her writing style, if you can find it in your heart to root for some of these tragic, broken people, than you will read a book that takes you on the emotional ride of your life.<br /><br />  I have a habit of reading some sad books, so this was totally up my alley. If Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire broke your heart, then this book might be a little too intense for you.<br /><br />  If you wanted to know what was really going on in some of those empty classrooms in Hogwarts, or how the Dursley's fit in with normal society, and enjoy books that are not action/adventure/mystery but a bit of a slow build, then you'll love it.
B001G83TQ2|2.0|I love simply red he is a great artist however this cd was a bad buy. and I waited to late to mail it back,  oh well
B008XNZMOU|4.0|I LOVE this cd.. it's typical TS, but it is a great one! If you like TS, you will for sure like the RED cd.
B000002IFP|5.0|Great! timeless music/ my son also loves this Cd since 4 yrs of age. Simply red is the bomb  your beautiful but so ugly... really telling individuality inner being
B0000042MY|5.0|Trevor Jones delivers one of his most magnificent scores of all time.  His majestic opening theme sets the movie as the epic film that it is.  &#34;The Kiss&#34; track is a hypnotic track that is used well in the film.  A truly rewarding listen.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|Love Harry Potter movies so sad to see all the deaths and to see the series end! The quality of the movie was great!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I was disappointed in this book.  I read it for our book club book this month.  I liked the writing style...told through writing letters.  I was just not that impressed.  I never did make any kind of a connection with any of the characters, really and certainly not the main character.  To me he was flat and way too weak.  I was hoping since this has been made into a movie that it would be better.  I am looking forward to our book club discussion, then maybe I'll appreciate the book more.  I would not really recommend this book to any of my students.
B0039Q7QKE|4.0|Ordered this for my boyfriend and I, we are both fans, although I do prefer the original series better! The product is as described and packaged nicely and came on time!
B003UYUP58|5.0|As an oncologist myself, I was extremely surprised to read this book. Using a simple and understandable vocabulary, it reveals the truth face of cancer, from it´s beguinning to its future.
1439127700|5.0|Very well written book with a lot of entertaining and surprising information.  Based on the information in this book, I am surprised we haven't had more successful assassinations of our presidents.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Subo really out did herself on this CD. Her voice is spectacular. The quest artist singing with her are excellent.  Very pleased with this muscial effort.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is actually quite good. if i can only get my friends to stop making fun of me now...
B0090O07S2|4.0|I thought It had more songs, but worth reliving old times. The production is excellent, did a good job editing, audio seems to be the original unchanged.
B00866H7SS|4.0|Ok. Not as good as fifty shades but pretty close. Actually very similar in so many ways. If u liked 50 then u will like this too. The story just isn't as interesting as 50. But it is still pretty good and kept me going.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This novel is to die for...its a book that u wouldn't b able to put down...two thumbs up..five star review..have to read the other two also a die for novels
B004D38HOG|5.0|She was honest. I felt her pain and she shared a lot of her fears. Showed an honest account if her life and insecurities without blaming everyone else in life. Couldn't put it down.

B001DPHDCY|1.0|This is a movie from a store like coborns that was rented out. I don't feel like this should be something that you should be able to sell on amazon.
1400067820|3.0|Is it all about how erudite he is, how inferior the world is, how he doesn't NEED an editor? (he does!)<br /><br />Or is there something concrete in this tome that I can use to make money? Long options is anti-fragile, but loses money absent a black swan.<br /><br />I enjoyed Taleb's first book, but - in the ongoing financial crisis - am reading for self-defence.<br /><br />I'll appreciate any other books people can recommend which bend insights like Taleb's to specific trading/investment strategies.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This is the first book that I have read by Ken Follett.  It is good enough that I must follow up with the two remaining books in the trilogy.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|So nice to be able to watch when we want.  Wouldn't be holidays without it to watch with turkey dinner.
1611761182|3.0|i love ken follett's earlier historical novels which i listened to as well.  but this one, the reader's voice is so monotone and boring i am having a rough time getting thru all the cds.  audio books need to have wonderful voices, this one fails.
0307272702|4.0|Taubes' book is great. It is a great book. I read it cover-to-cover and found the history section very informative and cause for even more concern around how the Food Pyramid gained such widespread acceptance.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT A BOOK WITH JUST THE PRAGMATIC WHAT TO EAT, WHAT TO AVOID STUFF, THIS IS ALSO YOUR BOOK. Just read the last half of the book and jump-start your weight loss! Once you see the results, go back and read the first half
B004J4WNL2|5.0|loved this book!  great read for introverts & extroverts alike.  i'm giving it as a gift to several people for Xmas.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I knew Navy Seals were outstanding individuals and committed to the USA but I was overwhelmed by their level of fittness and the risks they are willing to take for us.  Their families sacrifice more than I can believe.
0439813786|5.0|When I got this book, it just like a big brick.<br />I haven't read it yet, but I guess I will be a good book. The paper and printing are pretty good.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|Very fast CPU.  Upgraded from a Core 2 Duo and it was quite the jump in performance.<br /><br />I use this PC for internet browsing, email and P2P file downloads so I barely tax the capability.<br /><br />Processor idles at 32 degrees with the stock heat sink and fan.  My motherboard defaults the CPU fan to max speed...so the fan noise was quite noticeable.  I turned on smart fan in the bios and now the typical rpms are about half of max....and the fan can't be heard. At idle I didn't notice any difference in CPU temps running the fan at max (2000) or half of that.<br /><br />All in all a great improvement in PC power.....
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Heath Ledger was incredible.  One of the smartest adaptations I have seen. Rental can be  good way to go if it streams.
B00A23MYCC|4.0|If you're a fan of Seth McFarlane's work then you'll definitely enjoy this. Not a classic but still pretty funny in a bunch of places and definitely worth your time. Worth the premium for On Demand? Meh...maybe not.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I've been very addicted to this app. There is one thing I would like to mention to those out there angry about the lack of &quot;bits&quot;. As they may or may not know, if you tap on the Harmony shrines you can receive many bits. Provided you have a lot of that one particular one. Such as the Laughter shards. Hope this helps.<br /> As for the good and the bad:<br />1. Stunning graphics.<br />2. Simple, yet entertaining mini- games. (The ring around the ball does not dicern when you must tap it. I try to get as close to the pony as I can. You must be quick to do this though.)<br /> 3. Ivan play my Pandora Radio while playing the game. ( Due to glitchy sound controls.)<br /><br />the bad:<br />1. It is very difficult to get the other currency, hearts and gems, IGP is almost an absolute must.<br />2. Everything is overpriced<br />3. In order to skips quests you can't do, such as ones that require facebook or gameloft friends, you must pay with gems.<br /><br />Even with the flaws, I still enjoy this game and find ways to work around the money issues. I would recommend this to everyone.
B002K99P7S|5.0|Once I bought the Kindle Fire. Instant download, started watching. Of course an excellent movie; no problems whatsoever. I will continue to purchase this way and highly recommend the movie and instant amazon purchase.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very interesting read.  I was more impressed with before I started doing some research on the research.  At the end of the day though, I cannot believe that modifying natural substances has no detrimental effect on human beings, so all in all I found the material interesting and probably more accurate than other medical professionals are giving it credit for at this point.  Doctors thought the &#34;low carb&#34; scene was all quack medicine too... until they realized they were wrong.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Gripping and super interesting story - loved it!! Great characters and plot is original and fascinating. A new favourite of mine!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The writing is really terrible.  It's like having to live inside the mind of a teenage girl..  I wish I had a dollar for every time I had to read &#34;Holy Cow!&#34; and &#34;He's so hot!&#34;  That being said, if you're in just the right mood for something sultry and the polar opposite of complex and layered, this is your book.  It's a quick read.  I've heard that book 2 is much better, but I'm having a hard time getting there at this point.  I'm mean, how many more different ways can Ana tell us that Christian is hot?
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My two sons(3 & 5) and I loved this movie! It was watched 4times in 48 hours.<br />We will probably end up purchasing this movie. And it will become a tradition to watch this during every holiday season.
B008B68IEA|5.0|Bought this from Amazon for the awesome price of 21.99 or something like that and it was Aweseome arrived safe and sound.<br /><br />Giving 5 Stars because I love Monster High and its a great product, But....<br /><br />When i finally had the time to debox it Mattel screwed up and added two left branches for the sides of the head board instead of a left and a right. ARG! Mad about this but factory error so there is nothing I can do until mattel adds replacement parts for this or until i can find it locally and exchange it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks and is really fun. The new update is awsome. Now you can go to the nether and there are pantings and stuff. I recomend you get this game.
B009B50QOU|5.0|I didn't really expect some new Green Day to be as good as the old stuff.  No, it's not true balls to the wall underground punk.  But it is a album of well written, well produced, fun, energetic songs.  I'm really digging it!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I received a copy of Sarah's Key in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />My Review:<br />What a remarkably touching novel. I don't think I can say enough good things about Sarah's Key and the amazing writing job Tatiana de Rosnay delivers on. This read was a mix of haunting characters, historical lessons, and an authentic voice that kept me hooked on this story from page one. I loved how the plot effortlessly moved between 1942 and 2002, and it was torture to have to tear myself away from reading. I shed quite a few tears during this novel, and I would love to check out the movie version as well. I appreciate books that bring an educational topic to light, and I often found myself googling the Vel' d'Hiv roundup and reading some of the tragic stories revolving around that time. I really believe this a book for everyone, and I whole-heartedly give it 5 stars.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|If you love the regular angry birds you will love this one its so addicting but not in the bad way

0307361012|5.0|Reason for Reading:  I've been waiting ages for them to finally publish the first book in this series in English!<br /><br />Harry Hole's time in Australia is continually referred to throughout the series and it has been frustrating as an English reader to not have the first book in this series available to read.  Now that it is finally here and I've read it, I really wish it had been there to start with as it really does fill in some blanks and add insight to Hole's character that have been missing to the reader who has not experienced this first glimpse of Harry.  I'll admit it was a little weird going back to this new, fresh Harry.  At first I was in wonderment as I kept thinking, \\"wow, this is not the Harry of the later books at all.\\"  The guy was actually happy and eager for the first part of the book!  There was a secret in him though and it was eventually revealed and we finally find out the story of what really happens to him in Australia that adds to his burden of grief and guilt that he carries with him for the rest of his life.<br /><br />The mystery itself was superb.  I was thrilled to not have figured out the killer in this one and we are given plenty of suspects.  The murders are slightly gruesome with a couple of doozies added in for the chilling effect.  At a certain point the story takes a turn to the dark and Harry Hole readers will eventually find themselves in familiar territory.  As with all Nesbo books, once I started it was hard to put the book down and I can understand how this one won an award and set Nesbo's career as a writer on full speed.  The story does take place 100% in Australia so it doesn't have the Scandinavian allure that the others have and Harry is like a fish out of water in this setting for readers who know the character well but it's something a little different for us also and fantastic to see this character's beginnings.  New readers of Nesbo should certainly start here for full enjoyment of the character development.  Book 2 will be published soon and then finally, English readers will be able to read the series in order.  Great first book!ok 2 will be published soon and then finally, English readers will be able to read the series in order.  Great first book!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Brings back romance that should be there in a relationship.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because at times it would get confusing on who was talking .
B00371XIJE|5.0|This is more than an average good movie. It is a lesson in love, devotion, intelligence and kindness.  It made me know how much an animal can love us.  We too often underestimate the power of that love.  It would take a cold cold heart not to melt watching this movie. It is truly a love story, and a reminder of how smart and sensitive dogs are. Be kind to animals my friends.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Peter Pan is the best and most enjoyable Disney Anamated feature films.  The picture and sound transfer is excellant.  The DVD  extras are super.  Highest recommendation.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Could not wait to view this movie.  I had heard so much about it and loved the high energy and lightness of the movie.  I am sure it will be watched several times.  Order and delivery process were very good.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This Dvd concludes the Harry Portter movie series.  Everyone(if you are a grandparent) under the age of 75 has seen these movies.  You almost certainly own, this DVD, if not, why not?
B003UESJH4|5.0|We were happy to purchase this movie.  We had already seen it 3 times on cruises and had to have our own copy.  Excellent movie.  Very pleased with the order process and delivery.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|The Harry Potter series(both the books and movies) are the nearest  things to must reads and must sees of the past more than a decade.  We live in a world where everyone knows and(mostly) likes these cultural icons.  Don't have this DVD?  Your mistake.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really like this one.  I remember it from playing it at the carnival every year as a kid.  It is really like that one, too.  Same as almost anything else, though, I wish that there were more coins given out to start.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|The movie had great effects in it of course, we can say that now just about any modern movie but the story (and here we go again about modern movie story lines) could have used a lot of development. They need to slow down the pace a get into each character considerably more in order to make these unbelievable characters become a bit more real. Character development! Character development! Detail in story line would also serve to fill in the gaps.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars if it was up to date with the facebook version that I play online.  Other than that, I love it.
B005Z28M58|5.0|Awesome. I am really going to miss Desperate Housewives.  I throughly enjoyed the last season.  Highly recommend this season to all.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I couldn't but this book down. I hope they make it into a movie someday soon. I would watch it over an over again.
B004X4QW42|5.0|Great movie not as good as the original but still a great movie about Wing chun and some historical reference. I like the Japenese and other Chinese styles being the antagonist in the first film the British weren't used much. Twister has to be the worse charcter ever and probably the only fault I see in this movie, Western boxing has no chance any kicking martial art Muay Thai, Karate, even judo they uplay the abilities of Western boxing too much. I Loved the first IP Man and this one is a good continuations with a satisfying ending the kid at the end is so awesome LMAO. You should watch this movie if you love martial arts.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Bottom line, I had fun.  It was a bit short and the puzzles were a bit straight forward, but it was well done and enjoyable.  I wouldn't pay too much for it, but it's definitely worth a play if you like the classic find-and-use-items puzzle game.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The story was ok but the special effects were beautiful. We bought the 3D blu ray version what comes with several extra discs with bonus features. Have not been able to watch those yet. Big fan of the Alien franchise. This is suppose to be kind of a like a prequel and it does explain some aspects of those other movies. However, some of the story has very smart people doing very dumb things and that is what gets frustrating with movies. Sometimes the main characters do things that you hope they would not do in real life. Oh well, it's only a movie. I can recommend it for the visuals and say don't get too upset with the story. I still don't think I understand it all and am going to have to watch it again and see the bonus features as well.

B001DJLCPE|5.0|I forgive Stanley Kubrick for \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\", for he gave us \\"Dr Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\".  In my opinion, this is the greatest dark political comedy film of the 20th century.

B0017I1IZA|5.0|I am a 40 year old man who thought these books were going to be \\"chic lit\\", but that being said.  I love the Stephanie Plum series.  I have read almost 11 of them this year on top of everything else.  I saw the movie so I do have Katherine Higle (sp) as the vision for the character.  Each book is a lot of fun to read.  This one is no different.  I o make sure to read something else in between each of them because I can see getting burnt out doing one after another.  I love all the characters and how she continues the continuity even with the invention of technology.  In the 1st ones cel phones were not a huge part of the world and now she carries one.  I love how she does not address it - and keeps the book timeless.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|A friend recommended this to me.  It is an entertaining read and a good story.  If you like mysteries and the rugged west..this is for you.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have loved John Grisham for a long time.  The books he has done of late have been hit and miss with me.  THe last two \\"legal\\" novels have been great.  This is one of those books that I would love more of.  His story telling is effortless and you just like the characters.  This one is no different!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very entertaining and easy read. Learned more of what the characters were actually going through. I'll have to watch the movie again now that I have more understanding of their background. Loved it
B007HU7NBK|3.0|It was a good read.  I thought their would be more BITE to it from the title.  The Andy Taylor biography is a little more talkitive about the drama that really went on behind the scenes.  I have been a huge Duran Duran fan since the beginning and thought the book was good.  If you read it witht eh Andy Taylor book - it fills in the gaps.

B007HJ91HU|4.0|I must say that I'm surprised at this movie. I never saw the original, and didn't want to watch either. I thought it would be a corny little movie and let me tell you... I loved it! Its super cute, funny, and has great dancing. Little Mr. Willard completely stole the show and the movie was a 'feel good' movie too. It was just a happy little surprise to my day.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very accurate and user friendly app.  I also like that the small town I live in is in the database.

B001RNO7BM|2.0|I bought these before my trip to Japan and they didn't work out. On the first day of the journey I bought some inserts in the hopes that I could address the painfully non-existent insoles that they come with. The inserts helped some, but I noticed that the shoes were killing me after about 10 miles of walking on them. I actually ended up spending one of my afternoons in Tokyo trying to find some size 11US(29JP)  shoes to replace these. I paid a lot for the shoes I found because I was desperate and my feet were aching with every step.<br /><br />The build quality on these shoes should also be scrutinized. I noticed that my left heel was made differently and it feel strange.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Great book! Didn't want to put it down. How the brain works is so interesting and this book does a great job of giving examples and explanations. It really makes you think about your daily habits and how you have formed them over time. I highly recommended it.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|I will never forget. When my children become of age I will encourage them to read this so that they too will never forget. And when I next step outside and am greeted by a beautiful blue sky, I will think of Anne Frank.

B008PSPNFG|5.0|I'm a big fan of Steve but ever since the &#34;Alive in the Ultra World&#34; album I kind of lost touch with him. All the other albums that followed, didn't really grasp me. I don't doubt Steve's musicianship or his genius in those albums, but it was just too much for me to handle. When this album came out, I was skeptical at first but gave it a listen anyways. This is what's so awesome about Steve, he is no one trick artist, every one of his albums are so different from each other.<br /><br />Anyways, really dig this album, it's unique and Steve really rips it up, as to be expected.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|The story and beauty of this movie are enhanced by the Hi-Definition of the Blue Ray. I reccommed this to any sci-fi fan!

B004EPYZUI|5.0|Yes ignored the negative review about this, this film for me is unique, love the color of the movie. Bright dark cool sorrow, sometimes imagination can make someone motivated :).

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have this book in hardback, but as I'm living far away from home right now, I couldn't take all my books with me.  I just had to buy it for my Kindle!  I couldn't stop thinking about it and liked it just as much the second time around.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I have been a PIXAR fan since Toy Story came out. You can definitely tell when the story telling changed.  I believe it was with CARS 2. The animation in BRAVE was very well done, but the writing lacked creativity. The short was very well done. I generally buy each PIXAR film, but I am going to skip getting BRAVE.
B007SGM084|4.0|Good read... not as racy as others made it out to be... just enough :-)  They could've had a better deal since it was bundled, but it was convienient to purchase it for my phone. I would recommend it.

0930289234|5.0|I'm a grey-reality-comic fan. Watchmen, and The Dark Knight Returns are surely not in this category, but they include enough soul-serching  and negativity to reach me.
B009CPES4I|5.0|This is such a great movie. I saw it in the theater and had to see it again.  Do yourself a favor and watch.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Great yarn based on historic events.  Hardy as usual comes across with his deep brooding interpretation.  Excellent presentation of a subsistance economy that exists even today.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|I am not a huge fan of science fiction but I loved this TV show. A some episodes were really silly but by the middle of the season, I was hooked. Seasons two and three with David Tennant were just as good or better, especially when they continued the story line with Rose.<br /><br />I do not like the most recent Doctor. His story lines are more complex, but he is a bit of a jerk and seems to have had an inappropriate relationship with the fiance of one of his companions.

1401224792|3.0|Review courtesy of All Things Urban Fantasy<br /><br />I've had a hit or miss relationship with graphic novels, bouncing back and forth between original issues and graphic adaptations of old familiar favorites. FABLES: WEREWOLVES OF THE HEARTLAND is a strong vote in the \\"original content\\" category, as I found this story thoroughly entertaining.<br /><br />I have only passing familiarity with the Fable series as a whole, but that did not detract from my enjoyment of WEREWOLVES OF THE HEARTLAND. If anything, this book is an interlude outside other plot lines. The few hints of past Fables that I missed just piqued my interest to go back and read more of the series (Bigby and Snow White's story in particular has my full attention). WEREWOLVES OF THE HEARTLAND is light on romance (which is good, as our hero is married and no where near his wife), but werewolves provide nude eye candy on almost every page. Hairy eye candy at times, but eye candy nonetheless.<br /><br />WEREWOLVES OF THE HEARTLAND employs flashbacks to bounce this story from between present and past. The violence that ensues isn't necessarily inevitable, but believable enough. One issue wasn't enough to develop Bigby or his supporting cast as particularly charismatic or nuanced characters either, but I'll definitely be keeping my eyes peeled for them in the future. WEREWOLVES OF THE HEARTLAND is a fun fairy tale to pass the time, and a welcome glimpse of the Fables world. For fans of the series, this should be a must read. For intermittent graphic novel readers like myself, it was a pleasant diversion.<br /><br />Sexual Content: Nudity, a sexual situation.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|A revealing insight to the training and danger these daring warriors go through to protect us from the ever present danger of terrorism<br />True heroes, and a great read

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is full of lots of twists and turns and keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. The language is a bit explicite at times. The ending was a little disapointing for me otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|For those of you wondering about the difference between the UK version and US version, apparently the US version has had some scenes cut (hours worth of material). So the UK version is completely original and uncut
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am a former public school teacher and administrator.  I was invited to join a FB group made up of those who were raised in a certain section of the city in which I taught.  I was surprised at the response I recieved from members, who actually validated my career.

B0058VW36U|5.0|Physics made fun.  I have enjoyed playing this game.  At times it can be frustrating so I would advise younger kiddos to not get so focused that it frustrates them for long periods of time.
B000002KOQ|5.0|I love this album. This is Joni Mitchell at her best, folk music defined. My favorite is &#34;For Free&#34; about the unknown street person who plays the clarinet sweetly and eloquently, for all to hear, on the busy corner of a big city, not expecting any payment, (for free,) But nobody listens, because he's not famous. Almost every song is a description of another person, that you can relate to in some way, and Joni's voice is so lilty and high it just carries you away.

B000FBFN0Q|5.0|loved it and the entire series, as well as the movies! wish i could find more series like it: long, and utterly entertaining
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Enjoyed this album alot.  A definite addition to your holiday collection.  Zooey has a very classic sounding voice and the overall album has a great relaxing mood to it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've saved all his books for rereading some day.  Vince Flynn never fails to tantalize the reader with his surprising twists and turns.  The Last Man fulfills his ability to make you stay up and read the entire book.  I try very hard to keep from reading his<br />books quickly.....like limiting myself to a few pages before bedtime so I can eke out the enjoyment cause I know it will be months before he'll put out another one.  Over the years I have introduced many people to his thrillers.  He has a big fan club and am sure it continues to grow.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 lives up to the hype. Everyone usually gets nervous when as a series progresses that the show will take a turn for the worse, but this season has been a great addition.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|LOVE EVERY SONG ON THE ALBUM !! I'M DEFINITELY A TRUE RIHANNA FAN NOW. A MUST HAVE ALBUM OF 2012.
B00006879E|5.0|This is by far their best album, in my opinion that is. I usually buy albums for just a few songs, but every single song on this album is worthy.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I didn't like book 3 as much as the other two. I had problems with the following.<br /><br />1. Poor writing<br /><br />2. Repetition<br /><br />3. James got lazy toward the end.<br /><br />My biggest issue:<br /><br />Not taking full advantage of a thesaurus.<br />Point. Blank. Period.
B0014JLYS8|5.0|My husband suffers from neuropathy in his feet.  Neuropathy is a painful condition in which you experience anywhere from mild to quite painful nerve pain (this can happen in any part of the body, but generally occurs in you extremities).  His podiatrist recommended that he wear Crocs in place of slippers while inside the house.  These particular pair of Crocs were the most acceptable by him, because it does not have \\"holes\\".  He put them on and walked around the house, and he was thrilled by the fit and the affect on his painful foot areas.  I know that he won't wear them outdoors, but both of us are happy that these somewhat funny looking clogs have brought him relief.  The price on Amazon was incredibly good, much better than what the clogs are priced on another site.  Actually, on that site these were $15 more because of the color (black).  The shipment arrived as scheduled, and the packaging was excellent as well.  I am very glad that I located these clogs on Amazon, and that they have helped my husband deal with his neuropathy.
0143120530|4.0|Memory, the basis for human learning, is the focus of the New York Times Bestseller Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer. Foer documents himself as he goes through a yearlong \\"evolution.\\" His goal is to compete in the 2005 U.S. Memory Championship. He starts off as a journalist writing a paper on memorization and then is dragged into the crazy world of the championship. Throughout the book he learns the secret practices of memorization; he trains his mind to the brink. Foer is a great writer in that he speaks from the perspective of someone who is down to earth and isn't all high and mighty in the science field. He's just an average guy. This book is nearly impossible to put down, and teaches the reader how to memorize effectively.<br />Here's a brief description of the book and how Foer manages to battle through his memory contests. This book focuses on the author's journey to the memory championship. He delves deep into the history of memory and learns how to use it to his advantage. The two methods he learns are very helpful and can be used by everyone. Instead of simple rote memorization he uses the Person-Action-Object (PAO) system for memorizing cards, and the memory palace for memorizing lists. Now, rote memorization is the repetition of an element so many times that your brain is forced to retain it. This is an extremely ineffective method, because it is very tedious and overall retention is not very good. The PAO system, however, is a great way to memorize numbers and cards. Using this is quite simple, first one must assign an element to a number and in the case of cards, and an element must also be assigned to the suit. This is how people memorize three decks of cards so quickly. This can also be used to memorize telephone numbers or any sort of number set. So for example, the number two would be John Kennedy and the suit hearts would be drinking tea. So if one assigned an element to every suit and number in a deck then it would be much easier to memorize. Foer also brings up that sexual elements stick much better in the mind. So let's then say that Marilyn Monroe is an eight and riding a Ferris wheel is the suit clubs. So if you were to draw the two of hearts and then the eight of clubs you would picture Kennedy drinking tea while Marilyn Monroe rode a Ferris wheel. If you had an eight of hearts then it would be Marilyn drinking tea. The possibilities are endless. It could be John Kennedy drinking tea with a water dragon or Einstein fighting off zombies. This is how the PAO system works, assignment and sexual motivation will help the brain retain so much more in much less time. The other system is the memory palace, personally my favorite. This is very helpful in memorizing lists. To do this, one must first picture a landscape. This could be your house or your school, it could even be your alarm clock or something you are very familiar with, it's all about imagination. So once you have a landscape you take the first element on the list. So let's use an example, my landscape will be the Parmer and my list is as follows- Axons, Tuna Fish, and Stephen Hawking. The idea is to take each element and exaggerate it to ridiculous proportions in the familiar landscape. This makes it easier to retain the list. So let's start. In my mind's eye I picture the atrium, as I walk in I notice that the doors have changed into giant Axons, and every time I touch them I get shocked. I then make my way inside only to see a Tuna, in a classy top hat, eating Stephen Hawking. With all this ridiculousness it's kind of hard to forget the list. This is a memory palace. The main idea of this book is to introduce the reader to these types of memorization. They give a method to create concrete long term memories. The PAO and palace are easy solutions to memorizing and can be used every day in different situations.<br />These different methods of memorization are something I never knew about before this book. Frankly, I was amazed when I tested them out myself. I have used the palace style on all of my tests after learning it. For example, I had an anatomy test on all of the muscles, this was a daunting memorization task. But by using a memory palace I managed to memorize them all in a mere 30 minutes. Foer does a great job at explain the styles of memorization. He never goes over the readers head with science mumbo-jumbo. Foer uses a writing style that allows him to relate to the reader. He uses many different methods of writing throughout the book. He uses his life stories and other outside sources throughout the book. He also interviews people who have a particular disease that inhibits their memory or people who have astounding memory. He goes through his memory adventure but keeps the reader entertained through the stories of other people. Foer is also a very descriptive writer. He constantly uses imagery techniques to draw his reader in. He describes the memory palace in depth through these techniques and spares no detail in his writing. Foer just does a great job in documenting his rise in memory. He does it in such a way that the reader could do the same things as him. He describes his long days of practice and his intense training with his instructors. While Foer has written a masterpiece there are a few small things that I would like to criticize. Foer likes to bring up historical accounts of memory usage. This is interesting at first, but to the average reader it tends to become a bit stale. A few of his interviews also tend to drag on. Readers will be dying to get back to Foer's adventure, but are instead stuck with an old man explaining how he can't remember his own name. These are the only things that deserve criticism. Foer did a miraculous job and everyone has to read this book.<br />The content is fantastic. The book physically is also very interesting. The cover gives an example of a memory palace which would confuse people who hadn't read the book. But once you finish it, the cover makes much more sense. The chapter arrangement is also nice. Each chapter is cleverly named and makes sense once the chapter is read. It is also very nice in that scientific lingo isn't used to represent each section. The chapter title is always easily understood, but the word combo sometimes doesn't make sense. Overall, the physicality of the book is very nice and interesting, it certainly catches the eye.<br /> Moonwalking With Einstein by Joshua Foer is and exceptional book. I give it 4.7 stars out of 5 because the historical parts tend to be a bit dry. Otherwise, it has really opened my eyes to the art of memory and how the brain retains information. Everyone should read this book because the art of memorizing is so fascinating and extremely easy to understand in this book. Within a few hours of reading I found myself attempting to memorize a deck of cards. Bravo, to Mr. Foer. I hope that he continues to write because his words will surely be read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game so freaking awesome wish I could play forever cant wait to charge my kindle so I can play foreger

B00A12VJZM|5.0|The new songs are really good, plus this is like another greatest hits album.  But includes more recent material with the classic Stones stuff
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I'll be a Browncoat for life.  One of Joss Whedon's best works. I still wish they would get back and do the show again.
B00846REIS|3.0|This is similar to Shades of Grey with a less developed love story. It was okay but there are better reads.
B009JBZH54|5.0|All three movies are fantastic and it was just logical to get them in this awesome set.  Can't wait to get it.
B004ZY0VHY|1.0|I've heard the movie is pretty good and thought provoking. The book however was very difficult to get through and I ended up giving up on it.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  A classic that has magnificent dancing, singing and acting. Love Gene Kelly.

1419705849|5.0|My daughter was excited to receive it and read it in a couple of days.  She hopes there are more books to come.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|I love this movie, my favorite super hero, and the “Deleted scenes” feature it’s just awesome. I would love them on a director’s cut version.<br /><br />Cons: However, if you are a fan, you will probably find cheap the presentation of the disk, it has nothing inside BUT THE Blu-ray, not even a single image, picture or piece of paper, just a disk with only one tint color, Blue. Also the Blu-ray case is very cheap.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to any one who like this super hero, but don’t expect much quality on the presentation of this Blu-ray.
0920236251|3.0|I ordered the 3 copies of the book to be part of a book giveaway to young children in a reading program.  I was extremely disappointed that the books were so tiny. When my daughter was young, she had a paperback copy that was regular size and that's what I thought I was ordering. It's kind of a rip off being that tiny. It's not a good idea as a novelty and is very small for a young child.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am finding that the character of John Corey is getting somewhat too smart mouthed. The story line is very much like DeMillls other &#34;heros&#34;.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I liked this book but did not think that it was Flynn's best. I would recommend it to my friends.
B002YCVX5S|3.0|I would have liked to finish viewing it ... but I did not resume viewing in the 48 hour window allowed.  However, the movie did look interesting for the 10-15 minutes I did see.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My 4 year old had to be convinced to watch it, but afterwards she exclaimed how much she loved this movie!
B0043A0PXU|5.0|A relative gave me this Christmas of 2011.  I'm ashamed to say I didn't listen to it until after Easter, and then I couldn't stop playing it!  It is a wondrous collection of Christmas songs that remind me of my childhood and of all the joys and excitement that the season brought.  Annie Lennox never ceases to amaze.  Her voice is rich and vibrant and the arrangements are lovely.  If you cherish the memories of the old Christmas standards, you will not be disappointed.

0061474355|5.0|You will find Sabriel in the \\"Young Adult\\" section at bookstores. Do not let this deter you from reading one of the most enjoyable fantasy novels out there.<br /><br />Sabriel is a young woman raised on the wrong side of \\"the Wall\\" - a physical and magical barrier spanning thousands of miles and separating the \\"Old Kingdom\\" (the magical, unpredictable and unknown land) from Ancelstierre (a semi-modern country with technology similar to 20th century England). Desperate circumstances force Sabriel to journey into the Old Kingdom and even further into Death itself, for she is a Necromancer and has the gift of crossing over into Death and controlling the beings found there.<br /><br />Author Garth Nix moves the plot along very swiftly and his descriptive skill throws you right into the story. It's one of those books that becomes so real in your head you know it would make an awesome movie adaptation (Peter Jackson to direct, anyone?).<br /><br />Unfortunately the Kindle edition bundled set of all three in the series isn't available in the United States, but you will not want to stop at book number one, so save money by picking up the [[ASIN:0060734191 The Abhorsen Trilogy Box Set]] (it's cheaper than getting the Kindle editions each separately).
0062209493|5.0|Great insight into the trials and tribulations of SEAL life, personal and professional. Would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in this subject.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|this gaje is just waste of time, thats all!!!!<br />i mean you play this game and after 39 min u find yourself just fooling around and finaly the ending? what is this?
B007TK77QE|3.0|Ms Rowlings attempt at writing a book for adults suffers from her background as a writer of books from younger persons. The plot is simplistic and the vocabulary is rather limited. Perhaps my expctations were set a bit too high but this transition for Ms Rowling stills needs a bit more work - it is hopefully still a 'Work in Progress\\"
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have been playing Mahjong for many years.  It is great being able to pick up my Kindle and play whenever I want to.
B0014JIFWG|5.0|My husband wears these for work. He is comfortable and able to be on his feet the whole day.  I bought this pair to replace the pair he wore out.  I would definatally  buy them again.
B0000DYMRO|4.0|Love the songs and the way Whitney delieverd them overall, though not her best enunciation of some words.  She seemed to go overboard with her inflections and runs on a couple of songs that should have been smooth and flowing.  I was surprised at her referring to reindeer as reindeers and pronouncing Jesus in Hebrew different ways each time.  The duet between she and Bobbi Kristina is precious and they did a fabulous job.  I must admit, this CD had to grow on me.  The more I play it, the more I love it, especially when turned up loud! &#34;Gone too soon.&#34;
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Very fun, I think its great for a facebook game. will be playing for as long as its not completely ridiculous to do anything without gems.<br />xD

B00A5052YE|4.0|Alicia keys is one of the few artists whose complete discography is in my collection! She never disappoints! This is an album that all Alicia Keys fans will enjoy... I didn't think it was possible, but it surpassed my expectations!
B00932AA5G|5.0|It was fun to watch after long week. I like everything by Jo Nesbo. However, I expected the ending to be different, much like the other novels that inspector solves the crime.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this gameis great. its like Sim city but old timely style. you should play thks<br />game. I like the game play options and characters.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|First thing I did after reading this was call up a retired Marine friend.  He'd just finished it.  &#34;Is this way it is?&#34; I asked.  &#34;It is,&#34; he said.  This was &#34;can't put it down&#34; story telling.  We're all so lucky these guys are out there, taking care of us.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Title says it all. 5 stars for the bloody nine! Joe's books keep getting better and better. A must read!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a &#34;treadmill&#34; novel for me...light, easy, entertaining.  Not the greatest book I ever read, but worth my time and I did find it enjoyable.

B0007TKNII|5.0|Had no problem all at with receiving my DvD nor with playing it. Was very pleased and would buy another again.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|With over 850 reviews what else can be said about this movie? Probably nothing! I just wanted to comment on the 3D version.<br /><br />This is a pretty decent 3D movie and is probably one of the brightest 3D movies I have seen, so that was really nice. Some really goods pop out scenes, with decent depth. This is definitely a must have 3D movie, that is funny and heartwarming.
B008FOB124|5.0|WOW. Usually when a group re-appears after a long absence, one's review is colored by a mix of sentimentality and a secret hope that one enjoys the new stuff as well as their back catalog.<br /><br />DCD does NOT disappoint here.  Anastasis stands up to any prior DCD album, and is actually more in the vein of Aeon  or Serpent's Egg in its general tonalities, use of vocals, etc. I LOVE it.  It makes me hope beyond all hope that they'll tour again soon; saw them a few years ago at Radio City and it was one of the best live shows I've ever seen in my life.
B009ANP48G|4.0|The depth was really good, but the pop out effects just weren't there. The sands towards the beginning was really good and had me excited, but after that the pop outs didn't seem to work, the opportunities were there, they just didn't seem to come out of the screen. Maybe watching despicable me 3D before this spoiled me with the pop outs, but overall it is worth checking out and I am looking forward to getting step up 3 in 3D, because on bluray.com it got a higher 3D rating than this one, so I have high expectations for it.<br /><br />Story wise, for a dance flick, I thought it was pretty good. Keep in mind I have never seen the other 3, this was a impulse buy, but the dancing was what really blew me  away especially the opening sequence and the art museum. And for the guys, there are plenty of smokin' hot chicks in bikinis in this movie, which is always worth watching, and ladies don't get disappointed cause there were quite a few topless men with very toned abs!<br /><br />This movie is worth checking out, even if you just rent it. The dancing really makes this a fun movie with quite a few holy sh*t, how do they do that moments, and worth watching in 3D atleast once.
1878424319|5.0|And for the better. Easy to follow; keep an open mind and a willing heart. Not new information, but clear and concise.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|Fantastic album. Definitely worth an intimate listening session. There are intricate and subtle touches to the songs that can easily be lost but add so much depth to the album.
B008602KQI|4.0|The picture quality on the Hunger Games blu-ray was great. The story was very good. I would definitely recommend this blu-ray movie.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|The World From The Side Of The Moon by Phillip Phillips<br /><br />Amazing and very enjoyable music! I especially love HOME.
B0058A119G|5.0|This CD I selected for one track specifically, but was not disappointed with the other tracks which Streisand interprets extremely well
0345529057|4.0|Long and involved but the story line and development of two separate continents and how they will come together in the future editions makes you want to keep coming back for more. It is frustrating how long you have to wait for the next one but do really enjoy these.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|I am addicted to the Twilight Saga so of course I had to buy this book - it did not disappoint me in the slightest.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I think most stylus' are over priced. So this one was a nice surprise. It looks good, comes in at a good price, and offers three different point widths. The tips are made with a softer rubber, which could potentially wear out quicker, but in the mean time offers better feel and control. And I will probably lose it well before it wears out. It works with kindles and iphones and ipads. It has a nice clip to secure it on to covers. It feels good in the hand and look pretty good for a stylus. So if youre in the market for a new stylus, you cant go wrong with this one. Its simple and does its job well.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|Not much to say about this controller past what the title says. I'm by no means a hardcore gamer, honestly I doubt if I turn my PS3 on for gaming once a month, so I expected this to last some time. In the past year since I purchased this, I only used it maybe a dozen times, and now it is down for the count. Hindsight being what it is, i wish I'd just spent a few dollars more back then & gotten a stock PS3 pad.
B00902MCVY|5.0|Not as good as their first album, but it still ceases to impress me--can't wait until the next album comes out!

B008XNZMOU|4.0|The queen of breakup anthems has reclaimed her spot atop the music charts. On October 22, Taylor Swift released her fourth studio album \\"Red.\\" To date the album has sold over 2.2 million copies worldwide. I became a proud owner of the album on the day that it was released and have been continuously listening to it since. Some people may miss the innocent country days of the curly haired, mandolin-playing Taylor but I think her experiments with pop on this album show her versatility as an artist.<br />In this record she uses upbeat tempos and relatable lyrics to take her listeners through a journey of falling in love, everything that happens in between and then moving on. The album contains a variety of sounds including a piano duet \\"The Last Time\\" an electronic \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\" and tracks similar to her originals such as my personal favorite \\"Begin Again.\\" The majority of the songs on her album are well composed and I would not skip over any of the tracks. The next thing on Taylor's to-do list is a North American tour and I will be one of those girls in the crowd singing along with my friends. Although I prefer her past two albums, \\"Fearless\\" and \\"Speak Now\\" I think that Swift has once again reached her fans just with a different sound and for that I give \\"Red\\" an A.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|There are a lot of puzzles in all sorts of difficulty levels that make easy on other games more like extra special easy nice. And then there's the upper levels, they get really difficult. If you get stuck the hints actually tell you how they logically determine you can do it, and that helps you improve your  game play as well.

B007HACDLK|5.0|The author has a good grasp on the politics of the &#34;War on Terror&#34; and mixes reality and fiction to present a very exciting story.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I went to a concert of hers with my daughter, so I ordered the CD, so I would know her music. The CD was in great shape, but not really my type of music. But I wanted to be with my daughter, so it was definitely worth it! :)
B000NJMJGG|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a child. It is a super fun and action packed fantasy that is enjoyable to anyone.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|........... of course, but it's great to catch up with literary legend at last.  I have heard names like Long John Silver etc spoken of all my life, but now they really have life themselves.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I love zombie movies, but I was skeptical of this one because it takes a more comedic approach to what is usually a horror movie. But this one worked. I dare say it is the best zombie movie I've ever seen.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is the third \\"accidentally married\\" genre I've read in a month, only because that is what came up free. I thought it would be a quick, fun, light read, and it was. However, the dialog is excellent, the humor wonderful, and the back story of the characters believable (enough). I LOVE that she wasn't a downtrodden maiden, but a well-rounded woman in her own right, able to give him a run for more than his money. I also found it very real that after the chase was over, like many men, he woke up and had to face reality and deal with the situation he had created. Now THAT was interesting. His best friend was a great character. I'm glad he got as much time as he did. I won't get into the things that bothered me about the book, because they are few, relatively insignificant, and only bothered me AFTER I read the book and I don't want to spoil it for anyone.
B001B51B9M|4.0|I love musicals, and this is a great one. The Blu-ray doesn't do a ton for the picture, but the sound is amazing.
0142001104|5.0|I am excited to review The Art of Possibility. I thought the book was excellent: well-written, engaging narrative, practical thinking tools, and great energy.<br /><br />If I was looking for a point to criticize, it would be the rambling unfocused narration in the last few chapters. The book opens with a vibrancy and message that captivated my attention, but it seemed like the energy had waned considerably in the last few chapters -- like the authors had to meet a page count requirement and were just writing filler.<br /><br />I will personally use this book; I marked a lot of marginal notes that I plan to revisit. This book is absolutely a worthwhile read.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|What an amazing album, Ben Howard truly is an inspirational artist. I'll assume that you're already<br />a fan of his music so I'll avoid a breakdown of the songs.  The overall feel of the album though<br />is great, the emotions he explores really bring the fans along for the ride with him.<br /><br />I had the good fortune of seeing Ben Howard live in Boston and I can assure you he's just as good<br />in person.<br /><br />The album itself is made out of a thin cardboard like material, it doesn't seem cheap though and<br />actually goes along with Howard's earthy feel.  It does not come with any booklet, or posters, and<br />this version is missing the four or so songs that come with the deluxe version.  Otherwise it's a great<br />album and I recommend buying it to support Ben Howard and his future.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Belongs in any science fiction fan's library.  If you have the DVD's it's not worth upgrading to the BluRay, but if not, this is the way to go.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|An excellent movie, especially if you like movies connected to history. I wasn't familiar with the story prior to seeing the movie, but still enjoyed it. I felt that some pieces didn't quite fit together, but not so much that it ruined the movie. It is definitely worth watching.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This movie was really good, kept my attention, and that is something these days.  I followed it nicely, loved the special effects,<br />the story line, it tied nicely with the Allien beginning, and Fassberger was by far the best.  I recommend.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I never put up reviews but I just finished reading this book and I have to say that it was amazing.  It's the type of book that makes me sad when it's over because I want more.  But what happens to this person, or that person....where do they go from here.  I have fallen in love with these characters and their world.  I am rooting for them to succeed and I want to 'be' there to see it happen.<br /><br />Must read!
B004Y6MIXS|4.0|Great range. Mounts nicely on the case of my EeePC on the other side of my screen. The only problem I had was getting a patched driver to work for packet injection, etc. I did find one and it may be there now with R3 but it wasn't with RC1. Otherwise I would have said 5 stars.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Great new songs by Dylan, with good variety.  Excellent lyrics and musical arrangements.  He is still going strong at 71!
B002QBS9KE|4.0|As part of the Bluetooth headset. It's nice to see that there are verious sizes to choose from. We often do not have choices when purchasing a product like a headset and as to the earpiece size. Thanks
B0098460O4|5.0|As you can tell from the title,  I thought the cd was fabulous! It was a brillant combination of Jonathon and Charlotte's sweet voices. I saw them on YouTube and I just knew that I would buy their firt cd! I recommend to everyone to buy it. You don't even have to be an opera fan to love it!
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|A very good idea to help protect your bluetooth. Is made well, and is very easy to insert the headset into the pouch.
B002SRQ214|5.0|tem arrived in optimal conditions and the expected time<br />picked this item for the brand and price<br />I liked the model
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book Safe Haven and would recommend it to all.<br />It would make great Christmas gifts to family and friends.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was the must have movie of the year.  And to have four discs to choose from made it even better.  My wife and I can not get enough of this movie, and watch it at least once a week.  This set was a great deal, and once I get a 3d television, I will enjoy watching it in 3d again.  This also included the soundtrack which is great music to listen to.
B009H442DG|4.0|I thought it would be fun to hear them together again. It's not. This is a train wreck with Travolta at the wheel. He sounds so awful that my jaw dropped when I first heard it. I was embarrassed to be listening to it and turned it down so nobody else might hear! I couldn't listen to the whole thing for it made me cringe. Olivia still sounds pretty good. Obviously older but she knows how to sing. Travolta sounds like a baby trying to sing grown up songs. Or worse. Sorry guys, this not The One That I Want ....<br /><br />So that was my original review. Written after the shock of the first listen. But having spoken with a friend, director John Waters, I realized that this is a gem of a Christmas gift! Put this on at any holiday gathering and you are sure to cause a ruckus.<br /><br />This is the best bad thing to come along in awhile. Embrace its campy awfulness and you'll be smiling through the new year! Ever have a family member that thinks they can sing but can't? And yet you have to sit and just smile through it? Now you can return the favor by gifting this album.<br /><br />How could I have been so wrong? I am usually all over the good bad stuff when it comes along. This is to music what Faye Dunaway thought her Joan Crawford was to acting. Not as intended, but oh so much fun! Barbra, please!<br /><br />I originally said Travolta sounded like a baby. That wasn't accurate. I realized what he actually sounds like is a child who thinks he is being naughty by singing these songs. Kind of nervous excitement, trying not to giggle, while keeping an eye to see if any adult is going to hear.<br /><br />Please buy this album. It's for charity and its a hell of a ride.<br /><br />Sure to be a hit at parties and it will certainly have your guests talking! I got chills, they're electrifying!
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a great addition to the purchase of the blu-ray.  My wife was able to watch it the day it came out as we waited for the blu-ray to show up in the mail.  The streaming was flawless and I still watch it when my blu-ray or dvd is busy.
034580404X|5.0|Yes it has a lot of S & M in it but the story was very well written and I couldn't put the book dow.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I bought this after playing CrossMe a lot.  I was unsure what to expect, knowing how much fun I had wasting hours playing CrossMe.  The addition of colors to the game made the game easier and harder at the same time.  The only time that there might be a blank space is between the same colors, since you can have colors next to each other.  the pictures that you create are a lot better defined in color.  I still enjoy playing the original CrossMe, but the color one is just as much fun.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|I bought a iPod NANO 6th and although I LOVE IT cuz it's also my watch it lacked bluetooth. I bought this adapter as a bluetooth solution and it worked was able to transmit to bluetooth headset. I give it 4 stars only cuz it DRAINS my battery. I get 1.5 hours at the most. Other than that, great device.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I play this game daily, wasting at least an hour a day.  I enjoy each update, especially the newest one that places the time and battery life on the board so you can keep an eye on both.  I have drained my kindle fire battery multiple times trying to finish a puzzle.  i am still trying to finish all of the puzzles, and some times the puzzles are hard, but so far all are very doable.  Looking forward to more puzzles! not really a fan of the random puzzle for each level, though.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|You can never go wrong with a hot pink case cover as you can never lose it.  It is most helpful and protective.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absolutely love this series! Can't wait for more zombie bashimg excitement!<br />Even my husband has fallen in love with the series.
0345803485|5.0|Buy all three please. Deffinatly a page turner. Well priced. Came on time. Makes you wanna spice up your own love life. Yummy. I recommend this everyone i talk to And im recomending this to you. Not for young readers. Have you found your Christian Grey?  These books will have you reading till your done with them all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is a well-written book! The characters are fleshed out -- I cared how things turned out for them, and spent a couple of nights reading far past bedtime to find out. Insightful and well-developed internal monologues and external dialogues, and great twists throughout.
0345803493|5.0|Not for young readers. Keeps  you reading. Deffinatly a page turner. Good price. Came on time. Deffinatly have you wanting to try new things. Awsome.
6305433909|4.0|I thought the music was very good.  Student characters were well developed as were the main adult characters coming back.  This is a movie fun, but not deep.
0345803507|5.0|priced well. Loved all three books. Cant wait to see the movie and to see if theres going to be another book. Deffinatly not a book for young readers. Adult only. Prepare to do alot of googling. Awsome.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|My fiancee and I loved how fast this came in. Also how everything was wrapped up and looked great when we got it.
B008K6DU4Y|4.0|Works great on old Kindle Fire and my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone, but doesnot work on new HD Fire 8.9. Sound does not track and stops after playing a few seconds
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Well done ATLUS you guys not only ported over a great game but also added a couple of awesome features! Thanks I will play this game for weeks!
B000002AQQ|4.0|Even though I have some of these songs on CD or vinyl, it's nice to have them in one collection.<br /> I think my favorites from  this set would be \\"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head,\\" \\"What The World Needs Now\\" and \\"Let's Get Together.\\"<br /> As other reviewers have stated, it would be nice to have all the songs from the film included in this set. But, I suppose the owners of the publishing rights and or the performance rights wouldn't allow them to be included.<br /> BTW, I've never cared much for the film, though the soundtrack is excellent.<br /> When all is said and done this is a great set with very good sound quality, all at a fabulous Amazon price.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I decided to read &#34;Dark Places&#34; because I really liked &#34;Gone Girl&#34;.  In my opinion, this book is even better, especially if you enjoy dark humor.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I'm reviewing the 4 disc set. It's not unusual for a DVD to have a lot of deleted scenes but this time you need them all to flesh out the overly refined theatrical release. The 3.5 hour documentary on disc 3 is worth the extra money but I will never buy a new Blu-ray a mere 5 weeks from Black Friday ever again. There is enough here to be very thought provoking which is the mark of an unforgettable movie. I spent an hour online when I got home from after seeing this for the first time. I had a ton of questions but I have to say that repeated viewings has improved my opinion of Prometheus. Fresh out of the theater, I would have had trouble giving this more than 3 stars. I noticed when the DVD was released that the film seemed to have been rebranded to renew interest. The engineer wasn't shown in any of the theatrical release commercials or print ads but the DVD cover features a close up of the unmasked engineer. Prometheus may not be a prequel but unfortunately, there are so many coincidences that most people will leave the theater believing that they saw the derelict ship from Alien crash on LV-426. I think of my years spent wondering if the Alien had a home planet or was made to be a bioweapon. Ridley leaves enough hanging to spark debate and trade theories. It's ambiguous. I also hang onto the tension of whether or not Rick Deckard is a replicant. By the way, the franchises for Alien and Blade Runner have more in common right now than ever in my opinion. I've probably said this in another review but the more you know about a character, the less interesting they become. Boba Fett and Hannibal Lecter are good examples. These characters could all come from the same Earth where Tyrell and Weyland are one and the same or competitive rivals. One thing I did have in mind before I saw the movie was a tip from a friend who told me to Google: \\"Prometheus Flow Chart\\". There's a chart with icons illustrating the four possible outcomes. Even if you're already clear on the squid/zombie/human/alien biology, it's worth a look.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Ya its a Facebook game so if your into Farmville it would be fun for you, but for everyone else don't waste your time
030758836X|3.0|The plot was very clever and the writing good.<br />But, I did not find the 2 main characters at all appealing --<br />weird people in an overly clever plot
B009FZFONO|5.0|The Walking Dead has everything I want in a zombie show! I love the tension, drama, and zombie slaying! There is a few romantic themes in the episodes every now and then, but not enough to make me wanna puke! Highly recommend for all zombie fans. The characters are amazing. Rick is great evolving character and there are plenty of other characters to root for as well as hate.
B001AITGWE|5.0|Everyone in this classic deserves an Oscar. The premise is genius -- it is more &#34;right on&#34; as the years go by. Surely there are millions of men, and women, ready to crack than ever. How Douglas is lured to &#34;go off&#34; and how the wrong options just fall into his lap is portrayed in a brilliant way. The side story with Duvall is outstanding. The lesser story, handled by DeForest (sic.) in a chilling manner, is just as gripping as the rest of the movie. The ending is tragic but inevitable. I love this movie, more and more each time I watch it. Give &#34;Falling Down&#34; Give &#34;Falling Down ten stars!!
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|Title says it all do not waste your money on this crap. It is a slow moving movie with nothing worth waiting for no climax at all. Just bad then bad with an ending of bad
B00AE2J93I|2.0|Some parts a bit scary for some children under 7 as well as some adult situations some parents might also feel are inappropriate.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book is fast paced and keeps you guessing all throughout. Many of Grishams books are good but leave a bad taste in your mouth at the end. The Racketeer delivered a good story and a satisfying ending.
B00A77II0U|4.0|This is a good game I always play on easy and it is still a challenge too.<br />I would definately buy again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|absolutely amazing and addictive! I couldn't put it down and I cant wait for catching fire! I never thought this book would be so good untilI tried it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I like this series.  Lee Child is a good author that keeps your attention and appears to be accurate about the places, subjects and events described in his books.  Having started the Jack Reacher series, i plan to read them all in order.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was the best one yet !!I loved it sooo much!!!<br />I hope Jeff money makes an other book where rowley and Abigail hook up
B008WCP2PG|5.0|This movie was great. They story line isn't what I was expecting, but lets be honest, nobody watched this movie for the story line. You wanted to see hot guys mostly naked, and this movie is it for you! Channing Tatums body leaves you wanting more and more! :)
B0086449YA|4.0|anything from MK is good. so no need for me to ponder. I would endorse without any hesitancy. well done
0061433063|5.0|Terry Pratchett never fails to deliver a wonderful tale.  I really enjoyed the entire Tiffany Aching series, Granny Weatherwax was a fitting addition to this wonderful addition to the Discworld series.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|Good book,however it got to be too long and technical two thirds of the way through, plus I got tired of all the california liberal wacko stuff.
0307346617|5.0|Great Book.  Easy to follow and the short stories make it a fun read.  I recomend and look forward to the movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As good or better than any previous VF novels.  thank you,have a nice day, This makes six more words, correct?
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Greatest rock band ever finally recorded live with fabulous sound.  These guys were on fire. I can't stop watching it!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game it is great fun for time like road trips or airplane rides. I could play this game for a long time!!!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|you should add more exitment to it. like when you get a prize you get like 10more coins. make it so us kelids will get more exited with this game then i will rate it again.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Received the item very quickly. Was packaged nicely. There was the initial dvds inside a box, inside of a box. So it was safe! lol
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Pure failure. It failed to run with a Force Close error the first launch and every time since. It says it's up to date, so it musr be incompatible with the Samsung Galaxy S2...<br />I would rate it a zero!
B0094OLJD0|5.0|I read about this album randomly in a magazine at a doctor's office. I was intrigued, and when mp3 album was on a $4.99 special, I didn't hesistate to download it. Good stuff!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really like this calculator. Its handy, and simple and easy to use. It would have been 5 stars, but I couldn't check my square root homework on it, as it only has a couple of very basic functions. Overall, a good, simple app.
B005HSL626|1.0|There were too many ads that interrupted my game play.  I would suggest this if you want a trial version to see what the game is about before you purchase the actual version.
B008B11R2A|5.0|xx Does not disappoint, head to pitchfork for a better review.<br /><br />The product itself was a normal modern pressing, comes with digital download.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Fun game to play as long as you can find people to play with you.  It's easy with the random assignment people that actually play.
B00A0SQBDM|2.0|The game was great, worked well. I was able to solve puzzles pretty easy. The only flaw for me was the fact that I couldn't continue the game unless I paid for the &quot;full version&quot; :(<br />So no, I'm not paying for a game that's advertised to be free and I'm not giving 5 stars.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Once you start you can't stop. Very frustrating at times that you just want to BEAT it at all costs!
B008ER9QKG|5.0|love this new production of the &#34;Ring.&#34;  Saw it at the met opera house and wanted to be able to view it at my leisure.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addicting, challenging, and fun! You want to finish the whole challenge (30 puzzles)  in one sitting, which I do!
B007TK77QE|2.0|Peopled with charmless characters who inhabit a bleak landscape,this novel lacks the whimsy and humor which so delighted fans of the Harry Potter books.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|I like the Gods of Olympus and all Ancient Greece myths. This was easy to read kind of funny and well thought through. I saw the movie as well and wanted comparison to the original. Enjoyed it and now I'm gonna read the next story in the sequel;-)
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Great movie, a mother daughter must see! Really great to see the princess doesn't need a prince to come to their rescue.
B005LAII08|5.0|When this came out in the movie theatre's I knew I had to take my daughter to see it due to the sneak previews I had seen on the daughter/mother relationship.  My daughter wanted to see it because there is an actual character now that has &#34;her hair&#34; - not red but, big, long, poofy and really, really cury!  She curled up on  me watching this in the theatre and did the same at home when we watched it again.  Great movie!
B000M3452Y|4.0|I discovered this group after hearing the song Get Innocuous while playing the video game Grand Theft Auto 4. After buying this CD and listening to more tracks I found myself really enjoying the majority of the songs.  I found it to be worth the price.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Had this on VHS and my dog destroyed it.  My kids were devestated!  The Little Mermaid is pretty close to being their #1 movie of all time (in their minds).  Found it, bought it and kids lives are complete again.
B009SJ46EA|2.0|Loved the first season ... worthy of re-watching.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the start of the Second Season, I feel they are taking what appears to be a rich storytelling and devolving it into a gross-out fest.<br /><br />I don't mind startling scenarios. But there is not one heroic or sympathetic characters in the cast. They are each just selfish 'agenda driven' characters. And without a character aspiring for better, to defeat the horror, its just shock.<br /><br />Watch the first Season, watch the Walking Dead.<br /><br />As of now, I'm leaving the senseless disgust and mutilation of American Horror Story Season Two behind me.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|I already have 2 Neat-Oh City bins for my twins' LEGO sets that they have.  I just wrote their names on top to differentiate between the two.  Now my youngest is interested and I had my twins collect money between themselves to pitch in and &#34;buy&#34; this for their little brother for this coming Christmas.  I also got another one of the Star Wars ones for my neighbors son.  These bins are study and hold a lot.  The price was a lot less compared to Toys'R'Us and even LEGO itself.
B0051XQI84|4.0|My nephews (14 and 8) love this movie but after letting my 2 year old watch it I will wait a few years before buying this for him.  He wanted to mimic the violence in the movie where the older kids know that they can't do that.
B007MDB548|5.0|Having fraternal twins myself they instanly loved this movie.  Got the 4-disc combo due to the coming of the digital age in my house (my boyfriend is a super geek).  My kids have watched this on regular DVD though so far.  I lent my Blu-ray out to my neighbor to watch.  Reminds me.... It has been a couple weeks.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|Though this movie had some moments that really resonated it was not what I was expecting.  The focus is less on the pregnancies and more on the couples relationships.
0812984412|5.0|The Cloud Atlas was highly recommended and I was very pleased with the prompt attention to my order. The book was everything I expected and truly deserving of the accolades it received.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I just learned how to play and it is a cool game I am doing classless and this helps me understand the game better.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I never got to see this series when it was on TV and I am so glad there was a DVD to get because this is an really good show.  Little too much on the blue side for normal TV, but cable should have picked this one up.  I am not sure if I like the Western part or the fact they are several hundred years in the future and a bit on the Si-fi side.  I can understand why this is a cult favorite. Haven't finished the whole DVD yet, but really like what I have seen already.
0756405890|5.0|Before I started reading this book, I checked out some lists of the best fantasy novels, and this one was right at the top. I can see why. Excellent read!
B002JVWR4U|3.0|I haven' gotten to see the 2nd season on the DVD yet, but I remember the show as being quite good and I love what Josh Weedon does with his characters and the plot twists.  I am sure that I will like it as much as I have the first season DVD that I have, but I am being a bit reserved about it right now.
B002N7W3NK|5.0|great dvd, diana is incredible, only wish i could have it on cd too....so i can listen on the long car rides
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Love these books but starting to be like wading through a swamp and getting nowhere. Overyl padeed out.  i dont think Martin wants the books to ever end and so the story is just going on and on .
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Loved this book a lot! I like this series, and so do my cousins. Hope there are more soon! (:
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I love ghosts and ghost games so this game is so cool I love it but there needs to be a free full version this is j7t a tortal its not the full game. MAKE MORE GAMES LIKE THIS BUT MAKE THE FREE VERSION THE FULL GAME
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Easy to play,  but loads of fun.  I can't seem to stop playing.  Simple to play,  but the puzzles can be hard to figure out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't seem to stop going back to this book! I have read it over and over again.... I would have preferred an older Christian though.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I realize these books are very popular at this moment in time but they are much like the twilight series in that they are horrible written.  I really hated these.
1615470158|5.0|I've known Rob Collie (blog   @powerpivotpro) for over two years now, ever since he accosted me at TechEd in 2010. Since then we've met up at some SQL Saturdays, the 2010 PASS Summit, and we even collaborated on the computing power and hard dollar costs adjusted for inflation. And by \\"collaborated\\" I mean \\"I emailed Rob and asked him to show me what to do\\". And then he did. True story.<br /><br />When I read that post on Moore's Law again it made more sense to me this time. The reason why is because I just got done reading his most amazing book: DAX Formulas for PowerPivot: The Excel Pro's Guide to Mastering DAX<br /><br />When I opened the book to flip through the pages I will admit I was slightly disappointed in what I first saw: a bunch of formulas like CALCULATE(), DATEADD(), and COUNT(X). I thought \\"Oh, no, Rob has gone and written a book like all the other tech books out there, full of formulas and a desire to be like a textbook that it is likely never going to be.\\" Knowing Rob this surprised me a bit and since I had already spent my money I figured I might as well start reading it anyway.<br /><br />I started reading his while sipping on my coffee this past Sunday morning. I was done with the book before lunch. Not because it was a short read, but because I just could not put it down.<br /><br />Rob walks you through what is essentially the training program he uses with clients that want to know how to use PowerPivot. He gives you step by step examples and ties everything back to clearly defined use cases. He mixes in some anecdotal stories along the way, too. Rob worked at Microsoft for many years and as a result he has many, many stories to share. I think the one about Steve Ballmer was my favorite.<br /><br />Not only does Rob walk you through formulas he also provides specific use cases and shows you the pitfalls that he has stumbled upon through the years. In short you get years of data analysis experience at your disposal in just a few hours of learning.

B008O9V4C2|3.0|A great collection of tunes ruined by over-compressed audio on the CD.  The &#34;loudness wars&#34; have really gone too far.  But I think the real problem is that the recording was processed to sound good on iPods.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|That's all you'll think about after playing this game. Always trying to get the pigs. Very entertaining game for everyone.
B000KLRUJS|5.0|Richard Strauss: Elektra is a 1968 recording starring Birgit Nilsson under the direction of Sir Georg Solti who leads the Wiener Philharmoniker. The booklet contains all the lyrics, well written music notes and short biographies of the performers. I am a huge fan of Birgit Nilsson and I also have affinity for Georg Solti so I very much enjoyed listening to this amazing recording. Highly recommended. 5/5.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|Long time Donald Fagen/Steely Dan fan and have most of their catalog.<br /><br />This album ended up being a pleasant surprise, a solid effort, with a change in style from the previous albums.  Sound quality is not up to the usual audiophile level in the past albums - lacking the usual dynamic range punch the other albums have.  All around good album.<br /><br />The packaging is just terrible.  Really amateur hour.  The first copy I got came with a scratched CD (big surprise!, there's no protection!) and really misformed sleeve.  Returned it and got another one. Package the discs in jewel cases or I'm going to stop buying CDs, and get them used, since they look that way new.
0316228532|2.0|The writing is great...Rowling is brilliant with the English language, but i feel like i've been waiting for something to happen for the whole book.  Every time i pick it up, i wonder why i'm still reading it. Like a bad movie that you just want to end so you can say you know how it ends.  Too many characters that develop too slowly.  Seems like Rowling just wanted to prove she can cuss and overuse sex in a book. I hope parents don't it would make a good gift for young Potter fans.<br /><br /> It'll sell because she's established but if this had been her first book, it would have died in a publisher's office somewhere.<br /><br />I know she can't bring back Hogwarts, but I hope she'll be able to put this behind her and write something more noble again.
1401233791|5.0|A very good place to start for Batman noobs, though I recommend reading A Death in the Family and The Killing Joke first. They might not be the 'best' stories (though the Killing Joke is close), but they are referenced A LOT in the Knight Saga, and so it would be good to know where a lot of the motivation for certain stories come from. Outside of those though, you're not missing too much if you never read Batman before. I liked this story because it really showed a side of Bruce Wayne you don't see a ton of in the movies, TV shows and games. Him actually wearing down after all the abuse and fatigue of his eternal crusade, and what happens when he finally takes on a villain who takes advantage of it. Great stuff.

B003Q6BQPS|4.0|I've taken to asking my mom for one of the Christmas lego sets as my gift every year.  Last year I got the toy store; this year it's the bakery. Displaying the two sets together immediately makes the whole display nicer and classier. Can't wait to see what the whole series looks like someday, although I'll have to buy a bigger table on which to display it...<br /><br />I kinda prefer the toy store since its colors are more thoroughly Christmas/winter oriented. The bakery has some distracting light blue bricks that must have been leftover from another series (I'm also dubious about the winter cottage for this reason, but what to do...).<br /><br />That said, Lego continues their brilliant engineering with the bakery. The confections are ingenious (although the orange light from the light brick isn't especially flattering to the neon colors).<br /><br />The skating rink is pretty and complex enough that it could probably be marketed as a standalone product.<br /><br />The horse drawn carriage is also gorgeous. Heartwarming.<br /><br />The baker's wife doesn't stay standing up when she's holding the gift box out in front of her. I had to attach her to the snow/ground outside the house.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I read the book, so I wasn't overly shocked, but this genre is really rather silly to me. Buyer beware.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I've read them all. The Racketeer is a traditional Grisham legal thriller. Lots of interesting twists and turns in the story!  I would recommend it for anyone who has read his previous books and enjoyed them. Probably not the best of his books, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

B003XRDYX2|5.0|Commenting on the music found here is pretty much irrelevant, anyone who's found their way to this collection, or this package, is already familiar with the work of Bob Dylan ... probably the most influential musician of the last hundred years, if not of all time.  That leaves me with the production and presentation; though the most important aspect, the selling point, is that these are mono releases of Mr. Dylan's work.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, there is only one reason to purchase a mono recording, and that's if the original mono recording has been reprocessed for stereo.  At one time nearly all of Elvis Presley's material was converted to stereo, leaving the original mono recordings to be thrown in the trash, where they were found and saved.  A true mono recording is a totally different ball of wax.  Recordings done in true mono jump out at you, there's no fading from one channel to the other, no mixing and blending of vocals for a full bodied, full room feel.  Mono recordings are in your face, everything comes out at you full throttled, thick with atmosphere, but very one dimensional.  During the years Dylan recorded his early work, home electronics were in a state of major flux.  To be honest with you, most people only had 45 rpm record changers, and those who had the ability to play albums were pretty much limited to mono play, even though some of those systems had dual speakers ... and what most people don't remember from those days, was that these early platter systems played 78's as well as 33's and 45's, and contained a different cartridge for each.<br /><br />Dylan's work, as well as many other artists of the time, were released as both mono and stereo productions.  I won't argue that perhaps due to the technology, the mono may have sounded stronger, but in reality, that was due to the limitations of the equipment.  Yes, you're getting a really nice production here, heavy vinyl that's been created with high end efficiency, on state of the art production equipment, for state of the art equipment.  That brings up yet another issue, mono recordings require a mono stylus ... playing a mono record using a stereo stylus presents further limitations, leaving one to consider whether after purchasing these rather pricey records, one wants to take the time to install a new cartridge each time you want to play these babies.<br /><br />I now find myself at a particular juncture that I do not enjoy being at ... and that is that Bob Dylan, and perhaps those who guide him, have latched onto the notion of the concept of nostalgia, and that people of my generation, and younger, are willing to purchase just about anything the Thin Man serves up.  Listen, I love Dylan, but he has become his own worst enemy, he has become corporate America \\"... in the instant that he speaks.\\"  This is the same guy who sits at his desk, blows through a five set box of harmonicas, and sells them for thousands of dollars, and even more if you have the bucks to shell out for one that he's used for one song while on tour.  It's like those people who think they have a flag that's flown over the White House, we all know the image that brings to mind, but the truth is that there are a group of men who run a flag up over the White House every minute of the day, and then pass them off as flags that have flown over the White House ... truth and dishonesty all mixed to the point where we can't see night from day, and Desolation Row has been co-opted and gentrified by upstarts with too much money to even burn.<br /><br />But ... and quoting from Phil Gallo, a man I've spoken with many times on the subject of His Royal Bobness:<br /><br />\\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" (From \\"Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,\\" 1963)  Sundazed did a mono vinyl pressing in 2001 that minimized the tape-speed variation in the beginning of the track. Dylan sounds old on the vinyl version; his guitar crisper than on any CD version. The naturalness of his voice comes through on the new mono CD, especially from the middle of the song to the end. Here's the dig: On the original Columbia vinyl, Dylan's voice is significantly pronounced above the rhythm guitar which begs the question: Is it more important to make it sound good or sound as it did upon release? The SACD is an example of an exquisite mix with the voice in the middle, guitar on one side and harmonica on the other. Winner: The Sundazed vinyl.<br /><br />\\"All Along the Watchtower\\" (From \\"John Wesley Harding,\\" 1967) The SACD was a mixed bag. The vocals were so clear you could hear Bob's voice cracking and going every which way -- is that a gulp between \\"princes\\" and \\"kept the view?\\" But the drums sound like a snare and an empty ice cream tub, and the harmonica is piercing. The vinyl is pleasant, but lacking in dynamics. The new mono version solves all of that, with Charles McCoy's bass giving the tune a previously buried charge. The Winner: Mono Box.<br /><br />\\"Mr Tambourine Man\\" (From \\"Bringing It All Back Home,\\" 1965) The original vinyl mono takes the song's three elements -- voice, acoustic guitar and electric guitar and delicately places them in a perfect lineup. The SACD added clarity to each element, splitting the two guitars into separate channels. But the acoustic dwarfs the electric -- if the vocal is at 10, the acoustic is at 8 and the electric at 3. The mono CD version is a beautiful reproduction of the the original mono. Winner: Mono Box.<br /><br />\\"Just Like a Woman\\" (From \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" 1966) The new mono version does what the original mono version did it brings out the venom in Dylan's voice and gives the acoustic guitar lines a pronounced placement. There's minimal difference between the stereo and mono versions, and it boils down to a personal preference do you want the acoustic guitar, organ and drums between the chorus and verses to move horizontally or vertically? In stereo, they swing from one side back and forth across the playing field; in mono, they stack up like building blocks. Winner: Mono Box.<br /><br />\\"One Too Many Mornings\\" (From \\"The Times They Are a-Changin',\\" 1964) This is one of his more interesting early vocal presentations in which he experiments with shifting away from the didactic. The tonal shifts from the steely to the welcoming, lecturer to lullaby singer are in evidence in all the versions. The original mono vinyl release had a curious mix in which Dylan's vocals and harmonica dominate the recording, sounding as if the guitar is being played by another musician seated a few feet from where Dylan is standing. The 2005 stereo CD version has a more natural sound than the mono or stereo vinyl and the separation of components is not as apparent as on other tracks. The new mono version is a bit of a resolution, a combination of the best elements of both versions. The winner: Mono Box.<br /><br />\\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" (From \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" 1965) This is the greatest rock song ever, and in the top five of greatest records ever made, so even listening to a third generation cassette on a 20-year-old Walkman could not conceal its greatness or depth. That said, the original mono mix on vinyl emphasized a Wall of Sound quality with Dylan's vocals run through a heavy reverb effect. Part of the magic is that, as wide open as his voice is, it remains in your face. The mono CD version exposes a greater clarity in the instruments as the echo is reduced in the mix early on. Both mono versions use that electric guitar riff before the line \\"you used to go to the finest schools\\" to increase the dramatic effect, while the SACD version exposes a grinding quality to the rhythm guitar in the final third that is not as apparent in mono. The winner: Draw.<br /><br />\\"John Wesley Harding\\" It comes as a bit of a surprise that the album that benefits most in the mono presentation is the last one in the set, 1967's \\"John Wesley Harding,\\" which was released at a time when most people had given up on the mono format. The mono presentationenhances the intimacy of the country-folk collection of sparse guitar-bass-drums tunes. It's easy to picture Dylan, McCoy and drummer Kenny Buttrey plowing through \\"Drifter's Escape,\\" \\"Down Along the Cove,\\" and the title track with little concern for the intricacies of a consistent vocal performance, or where a lead guitar riff might be placed. It's a rustic gem that seems to go in and out of favor. The mono version might resolve that fluctuation and get it ranked permanently among his top tier discs.<br /><br />And back to me:  There's power in these recordings, and in these mono formats, though the value is absolutely personal.  These mono mixes present Dylan as he may have sounded for an in studio concert, with the band riding far behind him, presenting Dylan, his vocals, and his ideas front and center.  But ... score these as compact discs and you've lost it all, yes, the surface noise, an aspect I've spent a lifetime running from, is part of the necessary listening experience.  Me [?], I don't really care anymore, I've got an eight speaker surround system, and intend to blow out the room every time I load a disc ... I love these bright gold pieces of plastic, for the most part, I don't miss records in the least ... though I will give this set 5 Stars, I'm just glad that I didn't have to pay for it.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerblocks.

B00005R8GU|5.0|Could I have ever been so young, could the world have ever seemed so large, could my future have ever been more wide open [?] ... I don't think so.  By the time Fathers and Sons was released back in 1969, the closing year of the Summer Of Love, Woodstock was but a memory, the moon that hung low in the sky now had footprints on it, and I was about to enter the strangest world I will ever have known, and I've known several.<br /><br />But the American blues music scene was a strange place as well, having reached some sort of flat musical plateau.  Of course the Chess label was still thriving, and Muddy's Electric Mud had sold well, but there was an excitement missing, an excitement that had been missing for sometime if you ask me, and like the depiction of The Creation Of Man on the jacket cover, with the enigmatic message that these one-time gods of the blues were in need of a helping hand, and that helping hand was to come from the white middle class musicians who so revered them, musicians who being white, and looking like your next door neighbor, could easily usher in these dark wondrous sounds without causing a ripple in the the radical racial waters that were sweeping across this nation at the time.<br /><br />So ... along with Otis Span, Muddy gathered together the core of the Butterfield Blues Band, featuring Sam Lay on drums, Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn on bass, and the infamous Paul Butterfield on Harmonica, and managed to take the next step in the evolution of the blues, taking it one step higher, without reverting to the psychedelic wah-wah and distorted electronic effects that were so prevalent at the time ... preferring to sound more stripped down, yet more full bodied than ever before.  Muddy has never sound more crisp and clean in his life, and the rest of the band coalesces to create a bubbling red hot blues atmosphere that both sparkles with delight, and flies with the satisfaction of having brought something utterly new and adventurous to the table.<br /><br />And you know, standing there on the other side of the world, looking up at that big ol' yellow moon hanging low, footprints or not, with Fathers and Sons playing in the background, it still gave me shivers.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler/>And you know, standing there on the other side of the world, looking up at that big ol' yellow moon hanging low, footprints or not, with Fathers and Sons playing in the background, it still gave me shivers.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler

B0040JHWKS|4.0|\\"At the time, I was still held in thrall by the towering pop records that had shaped my youth ...\\"  All and all that's just fine, but like Mr. Dylan, Bruce seems to be releasing a ton of material that certainly deserves to be heard, but some thirty years off, if these songs were left on the cutting room floor back then, do they really deserve a place of prominence, or are they merely a perspective into the scope and sequence that brought the music of this Jersey Boy, by way of New York City, or vise versa to the attention of the world, branding him like some '57 Chevy, one of the most powerful and innovative artists of the last century.  Certainly Bruce is finding both his voice, his music, and his muse here ... all evident by his liberal borrowing [?] from the music that so inspired him, and in that sense, this is a very important body of work.<br /><br />Rather than simply processing and reviewing this body of work, I feel it's more important to consider several of the songs, note their genesis, and see their development.  \\"Racing In The Street\\" is far more than a mere nod to Martha & The Vandellas, Bruce wraps his head around their energy, and their visions of great pop songs, laying layer after layer, till it's almost a wall-of-sound, as the music struts on.  The song has a much more human feel to it, more somber, then what we've come to know, relying on a more pronounced harmonica and piano.  \\"Gotta Get The Feeling\\" is an unavoidable slash across the face of rock n' roll, creating a Phil Spector induced mesh of Badfinger meets The Four Seasons, suitable for dropping the top after a cool rain, allowing Clarence to ripple perhaps his most sustained and melodic sax riffs of his career.  \\"Outside Looking In\\" doesn't rock, it gallops in like a heard of horse, heavy on heartbeat reverb, and lyrics that can't be challenged, or beholding to any other number.  \\"Someday We'll Be Together\\" is a rather weak, but beautiful track, nearly classically done, laced with atmospheric effects, and a held in check euphoria.  \\"One Way Street\\" conjures Smokey Robinson, is filled with youthful yearning, yet opportunistic in its nature, with hints of \\"Thunder Road.\\"  What [?], you don't know the Flamin' Groovies, then get ye to the record store, and hear what they taught Bruce here, as he stumbles through a love gone wrong rockin' ballad, complete with a sensational guitar solo that's double tracked to perfection with the a sax solo that's so good you'll be jumping back just to hear it again and again. \\"Rendezvous\\" was recorded in one take, and is brilliantly evident, sounding powerful, full of pop guitar jangle, a knock your socks back brief set of fuzz, a couple of stolen lines, and drumming that has Keith Moon written all over it.  \\"Ain't Good Enough For You\\" harkens back to \\"Palisades Park,\\" full of finger popping, girl twirling melodies that will have you strolling down the boardwalk like you own it, sending out infectious eye spark that's sure to turn heads in jeans that are just too tight for even the night.  \\"Fire\\" beaks all the rules, slowed down in tempo, lustful, sweaty, full of passion, and Spanish Stroll, built for the 4th of July, and cherry bombs in the night.  This is a minimalist version of what we've become accustom to hearing, punctuated by Steven's brilliant guitar work, and a sax rhythm stolen directly from Booker T. & The MG's, but that's not a bad thing, that's a dancin' fine smile.  \\"Come On Let's Go Tonight\\" is totally reworked, the melody is very somber, almost tearful, though the Celtic feel from the accordion and violin almost do and don't work in the same breath, it takes a man like Springsteen to pull this off without looking shameful.  \\"Talk To Me\\" has a ska feel to it that will not be denied, with lyrics that tumble like dice from his lips, yet at the same time is full of a un-obvious blue eyed soul.  \\"Breakaway\\" is probably the only epic on this release, and one of Bruce's early strong points, raising the ghost ofRoy Orbison [how come Bruce was never part of The Traveling Wilbury's?], back to a rhythmic military drum, filled with visions of troubled youth, and a wasteland just over the horizon that seems to offer the only hope.  Some parts are a bit cheesy, and Bruce certainly pushes these aspects in his later work, making a lot of it seem trite and unnecessary.  \\"City Of The Night\\" comes at you like a slow burning fuse that strolls, and is more than worthing of anything Mink DeVille ever laid down.  The song simmers much like Lou Reed's \\"Walk On The Wild Side,\\" full of summertime imagery ... and is just too short for my liking.<br /><br />And that my friends brings us right back to the initial question, and my favorite bench on the boardwalk, regarding the importance of this body of work ... The Promise is what it is, it's up to you to take from it any and all of what moves you, and after all that's the real thrill of music in the first place.  But hearing Bruce lay out these numbers, some familiar, some new, certainly gives one pause to sit back and consider what might have been, and perhaps spark you to listen to those early recordings with a new set of ears, and a deeper appreciation for the work and emotion of Bruce Springsteen.  There are a couple of killer numbers here that I'll slide into my iPod, and program into my disc player, but for the most part there's nothing earth shattering to be found, it all feels really comfortable, as if theses tracks have been forever playing in my head, or perhaps like I've recently discovered a Springsteen album I overlooked for some reason ... though having heard this release, I wouldn't want to be without it.<br /><br />Review by Jenell KeslerRoy Orbison [how come Bruce was never part of The Traveling Wilbury's?], back to a rhythmic military drum, filled with visions of troubled youth, and a wasteland just over the horizon that seems to offer the only hope.

159448385X|4.0|Intriguing story but not as emotionally charged as Kite runner and had a tendency to be all over the place but all in all a good read. His new book \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" is absolutely fantastic! Hardly do I ever read books more than once but I had to read that one again, a phenomenal story!
B0040HJNKC|4.0|Living Proof certainly is ... proof that music can take you to the tops of the mountains, to the depths of the seas, wrinkle you face with wisdom, cause the setting sun to forever shine on your path, and warm your soul.  This is perhaps the most autobiographic album any blues artist has ever put out, literally telling you the story of his life, while blistering the strings of his guitar like I've never heard before; as if this old bluesman were channeling the youthful fingers of Stevie Ray Vaughan and the swagger of Jimi Hendrix.  I mean the cat is smokin', dishing out lyrics that are sophisticated, relevant, incisive, exciting, and intoxicating.<br /><br />And what makes this album so creative, is that Buddy varies the band from track to track ... including David Grissom and Reese Wynans, who he uses on nearly all of the songs.  Other guests feature B.B. King, and Carlos Santana, both weaving bright delightful unexpected guitar work.  B.B. King, following in the fashion of the album, lays out a life affirming and reflective take on \\"Stay Around A Little Longer,\\" filtering a fine addition of rhythm and blues soulful sweetness, that rides in stark juxtaposition to the rest of the the numbers found here ... though their incestuous complementing of each other throughout the second half of the song does cause me to rub the back of my neck, thinking that perhaps the track's just too sweet.<br /><br />The thing that sets this release apart from other releases by Buddy Guy is that though he's still committed to the Chicago blues structure, the production is a bit slick ... but not in a fashion that's dismissive, or irrelevant, it's just a more full bodied proposition that fails or stumbles not once.  Buddy is still full of tension, distortion, and carries a lust for life, and the blues.<br /><br />The living proof is in the listenin' ...<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B002ZG97E2|5.0|Kids of all ages will love this movie.  Great storyline where Orphans melt an evil villains heart.  &#34;Its so fluffy&#34; has new meaning!
B005OHSD3A|4.0|This is an updated approach to the conventional low-carb Atkins diet.<br />The Atkins diet has strong supporters and entrenched doubters; this book<br />will probably not convince either camp to change their opinions.<br /><br />What this book does well: Explain the science behind the Atkins approach,<br />and share success stories and case studies that verify the results. It's clear<br />that cutting back on carbohydrates produces weight loss.<br /><br />What this book doesn't do entirely well: Earn the title \\"new.\\" Atkins has<br />been revised and revisited several times. It is still essentially the same<br />approach. Banish carbs in a radical way at first, then work \\"healthy carbs\\"<br />back into your diet. That may be good advice (depending on your opinion)<br />but it's not terribly \\"new.\\"<br /><br />Useful and practical. Readable and engaging. A well-written book.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This movie was fantastic. It had brilliant writers and actors. The graphics are amazing. All around great movie. May be a bit scary for children, but my older boys enjoyed it - and recognized Thor. ;)
1452111014|4.0|It was great but at the end it seemed like it was unfinished with just turbo there at the end..
B005LAII08|5.0|This movie is AWESOME! Not only will children love it - adults will too! My 4 sons AND my 2 daughters LOVE it. The twins are hilariously mischievous for my boys and the fact that this girl is a princess AND independent makes me rough and tough daughters ecstatic! She's a get in there and kill a deer kind of girl and movie is her favorite right now. A girl who isn't just a sit and act pretty, but a get in there and make something happen kind of gal.
B009329ZF2|3.0|The kids enjoyed for the action, but the storyline not too feasible.  How did Hopper go from a free-loader brother to a Navy officer so quick??
B008KE3960|4.0|Fun game that actually took some strategy.  I enjoyed the gradual progression, the plane options, etc.  Didn't last very long without needing to purchase more levels, etc.  Not worth the purchase to me, but the free play was great.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Totally enjoyed this book. The characters are real and brave. What a testimony to the resilience of youth and to once again realize that life is just not fair.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I was a bit confused when I got started, but the game became addictive once I got the hang of it.  Of course you wont progress as quickly if you don't intend to spend your money.
B0029ZA49Q|2.0|i find this product uncomfortable to wear. causes the top loader to get in the way.  could use padding on the shoulders
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game has been fun for both my 5 and 7 year old and I have enjoyed it too!  Somewhat addicting to see if they can stump me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I liked the book for its outstanding plot.  Halfway through, I couldn't put the book down as it had me totally enthralled.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I like this because it is a nice and quick survey of international news from the BBC perspective, which is a more comprehensive view than most U.S. sources.
141659521X|3.0|Didn't read it myself. It was a gift to relative in another state. As I understand their response it read just fine and none of the pages fell out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was not at all what I thought it would be about.  I'm still not sure who the psychotic was or if it was both of them?!?!  Great read!
B0000DJE9R|5.0|what can you say it's Michael Jackson.  i do like the majority of michaels songs, but then there are some others like best.  he just had a song for everyone to relate too. He left to early, but we can still listen to him anytime. Thanks Wally.
B0056TYT66|5.0|Initially, I bought the MSI 2port external usb3.0 and 2port internal sataIII. Disappointed that I did not get what I've ordered so I've returned it for a refund. Although more expensive and does not look as good as the MSI, this card works like a charm. After downloading the software and driver from [...] using PDC3 for search criteria, I was able get two additional internal SATAIII 6gb hard drives attached and mounted in addition to my 3 internal HDs that I already have. The reason for getting this card was to have a single partition beyond 2TB which was the limit of my motherboard.  So with this card, I'm able to operate my computer with these specs:<br /><br />- Transcend Card sataIII Port0: Seagate Momentus XT Hybrid (Replaced Samsung SSD 128GB)Bootable C:<br />- Transcend Card sataIII Port1: Seagate 3TB single parition (GPT yeah)!<br />- Internal bus sataII 500GB swappable<br />- Internal bus sataII 1.5GB swappable<br />- Internal bus sataII 2GB<br />- Transcend Card USB 3.0: External Seagate Backup Plus 3TB<br />- Transcend Card USB 3.0: For card reader.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love the color - it is bright and easy to handle. I have it sitting up at the moment while I read the instructions and type at the same time. It props my Kindle up at any height comfortable for me, and I read and type this Review.<br /><br />The best of all of the Standing Cases. They are cheaper also and come in wonderful bright colors.
B00005N6RU|1.0|Despite paying extra for 1-2 day shipping, this DVD still took 3 days before my order was shipped. Once I finally received it, I discovered that this is the UK edition of the DVD...which doesn't play on my computer. I had to go to B&N to buy an expensive copy because I'm using this movie for a final project for school.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is a great game but it will not update i am so mad i have a ipod and it updated  on there but idk how to update it on my fire
1608871452|5.0|AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING! I'm going to get another one so I can take one apart and keep one pristine - I'm thinking I'll get it signed by the cast at the next convention I attend. Brilliant book!
B000KX0IOA|5.0|The story of Gandhi has had such a terrific impact on me over the years.  This man, by his life, shows us how to truly live peacefilled.  We could change the world if we followed his example.
B004OR199G|5.0|Kris Carr has hit the nail on the head with this book! This book is extremely informative in a very conversational manner!! An important book to read.
0307266303|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read.  I loved the mixture of personal experience and background research.  Following advice from this book helped me improve my run and actually enjoy running again. For an aspiring athlete, this is a must read.
B001N4Q4MA|1.0|bought for my daughter to watch on her tablet and coundnt get it to download to her tablet waste of my money
1423113454|4.0|This was the first full novel read by my 8th grade student who just moved to the US from France in September.  She loves stories that use mythology and was very excited to finish. She's not able to judge the language and style yet, but the plot and dialogue kept her interest. She is looking forward to reading another Rick Riordan book soon.
B0090EKRKU|5.0|It teaches valuable lessons on many levels and is entertaining for all ages.  I would recommend movie this to anyone.
B005HED08I|5.0|Just as good as it was the first time I viewed it in the 60's. I'll be ordering more of these.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|Bought this movie on amazon before it was available anywhere else. I only purchased the standard definition version but the picture and sound quality were still excellent.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|fun game. You need to do the tutorial to learn it. But unfortunately you don't have a lot of missions or aircraft choices. Still fun
0307592731|3.0|Perhaps you can tell from the headline that Cheryl Strayed's personal journal was not a good choice for me. Yes, she did prove to herself her personal toughness, but I'm weary of self-promotion & me-me-me books!<br />Enough said.........
B00007AJGH|1.0|Why on God's green earth is this DVD \\"offered\\" for $50?  It's crazy.  Please consider not buying this to send a message about gouging.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Exceptional movie on so many levels.  Will be enjoyed by all but the very young.  I would definitely encourage friends to watch and collectors of good films to buy.
B009329Y30|5.0|Watched this with my wife and both of us enjoyed it. It held our attention thorough out and am giving it good ratings.
B008O69SZ0|4.0|At 73 Hunter puts the majority of young rockers to shame. Of course some of his subject matter the young-uns couldn't pull off but that is exactly what makes this record- like the last three- so good.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Great movie. Great cast of actors. I have watched this movie over and over and it had not dissapointed yet. Nor will it!!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The author compares three contemporaries to Abraham Lincoln which brings to life the similarities and differences between them and helps to give the reader a fuller understanding of the times.  Thoroughly enjoyable read!
0064430227|5.0|We have purchased many of the Harold collection books. The little one loves them to be read to her over and over. Would reccomend.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|I like most anything Michael Connelly writes and I liked the stories.  Especially liked the teaser for the new book.  Enjoy.
0783229526|5.0|What else can I say but awsome. Hunter S Thompson never dissapoints. Love the book, love the movie. Have purchased many of his books and have enjoyed them all.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|This is an unbelievable deal. Well organized and edited, every word The English Language's greatest author has written can be yours for under a buck.  Extra material includes biographies, plays and stories written by others but based on his characters.... this is a book case worth of material.<br />My only complaint is one I wish the Kindle Software Geeks would work out : This collection is so huge that an entire Dickens Novel (typically 800-900 pages hardcover) only represents 2-3% of the Download, so the reader has no idea where he is in the progress of the novel without flipping back  and forth to the table of contents. It would be better if this collection could revert to the individual books once it is in the Kindle or if the Kindle's owner could label his own \\"first and last page\\" and then the Kindle could track the progress between  those two points.
B0091QS88K|5.0|super cute &amp; interactive! characters are nice &amp; we liked the cooking steps. pretty realistic! 5 srars for a 3.5 year old boy
B0064NTZJO|1.0|Where do i begin..... Drive was bad, like really bad. I heard so much hype about this movie, so i gave it a shot. holy crap this blows, i cant even focus on the specifics enough to include them so this is more of a rant. some friends and i Redboxed this movie and we sat through it and talked crap about it the whole time, and at some points the movie was so low in volume during the dialog that we actually thought the tv's speakers were broken. i can go on and on about how bad this movie is, was and will always be, but ill end my review with this statement. THERE HAS BEEN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST THIS MOVIE FOR FALSE ADVERTISING. Enough said right? I almost laughed to death when i saw that report on the news. good for you Plaintiff.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I've never really watched the show, in fact I don't know who Perry is, but this game is really fun, even my boyfriend got hooked.
1400067820|5.0|People forget to mention the most important aspect of the book: It's fun to read! Yes, the tone can be harsh, even ruthless. Don't get offended by Taleb's tone. A fraud is a fraud and Taleb calls it that. Ruthlessness is just the expression of moral outrage. So, enjoy the read. It's fun. You will have a fabulous time.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|I expected a lot more from this movie.  I expected to be entertained, turned on, or at least it should have given me something to laugh at but, the plot was very weak, and I'm not convinced the girls brother was ever a football player.  It wasn't believable and the cinematography seemed very cheap.  I could have made this movie by leaving a camera on the front of a stage and filming people hanging out after a long night of drinking.<br />I wish I hadn't wasted by time.
1423165691|4.0|If you are a Disney animation fan you will enjoy this book.  The book contains some very good sketches.  Be aware that is all this contains is sketches.  There is no finished artwork.  This may not be a book for everyone, but I really enjoy it.  I pull it off the shelf and flip through it often.
B004J4WLPU|3.0|I wanted to be really into this book but I stopped about three times before finishing it. The book starts out very slow and continous that way I was about 75% into the book before I was really “into the book and was hooked and had to finish it.  I also got confused by who was who with some of the characters the xray feature on my kindle fire helped me out, it also helped me with a lot of the words.  Because the book is set in England many of the nuances were hard for me to catch right away, and some of the words I could figure out but were unfamiliar.  There was a large focus on dealing with grief in this book.  I haven't really lost anyone that close to me, but if I had I can see how I maybe could have appreciated the pace of this book.<br />In summary if you are familiar with the language of the UK and have lost someone close to you this book with take through the emotional journey of a woman who lost her sister from initial grief through denial and acceptance.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app! Works great and has a large display,  I could not ask for more with a basic calculator
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Nice read with an unexpected twist but not of the quality of his first books. His recent volumes seem to be more about making money than spending the time to actually finish a book realistically.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I enjoy reading tweets from a very varied<br />Group of people a programs.  It fun to see what others think<br />About subjects that interest me
B007SGM084|5.0|Every woman that has a stump in her marriage has to read this.  After her spouse asks her why she's changed tell him to start reading it, or read it aloud to him.  The new found love that C. Grey has for Ana is something new and inexperienced by him, just like she was.  Their growth is something we can all learn from.
B0052GACNM|4.0|This CD was purchased as a Christmas gift. Both my wife and I have listened to it before and enjoyed it
B0063IH60K|3.0|Not as fast as on my phone but still fun! Also uses battery faster on kindle than when I play on my phone.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This was an excellent series.  I didn't expect it to be as good as it was because most people I talked to who had seen it all said the same thing: \\"It was okay but it wasn't as good as 'Band of Brothers.'\\"  I sincerely believe if \\"Band of Brothers\\" had been released AFTER \\"The Pacific,\\" many people would be saying \\"Band of Brothers,\\" a great series in its own right, was OK, but not as good as 'The Pacific.\\"  To be sure, there's a price to pay for coming in second place.<br /><br />I've heard it said before that the war in the Pacific was really just a big race war.  Of course, I wasn't there; but from what I've seen of media depictions of the Japanese- not just as an enemy we were at war with but as an entire race of people; and hearing firsthand testimony from WWII veterans, I believe this was true.  And this program was not shy in depicting it.  I'm not saying I enjoy seeing racism... of course, I think it is reprehensible.  But as a historian, I'm glad to see the past depicted as it really was rather than in ways that are just about making us feel comfortable.<br /><br />If you have any interest at all in the history of the Marine Corps or World War II, I highly reccommend The Pacific to you.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Besides the usual glitzy animation from Pixar, there's not much in this movie. There was clearly a lot of investment in getting the physics of curly hair believable, so kudos to the technical wizardry, but the story was a total disappointment. Everything happens more or less between two principle locations (castle and the &#34;stonehenge&#34;), visited repeatedly by the main characters, although the canvas for this story could have been much bigger. Humor appears in the wrong places and several scenes are stretched too long (e.g., the bear chase in the castle).  The actions of the princess, such as giving her mother an unknown spell from a demented witch, are simply too ridiculous to believe (unless her bravery is compensated by a low intelligence).
1419701533|5.0|Great books for 3rd - 6th grade. My son is 8, and in the 3rd grade, and he loves them.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I loved the subtly of the storey line. While this is obviously aimed at teenagers, as an adult i found it great read. The depth of the characters is amazing and it is a scathing commentary on some of the things we see around us in the world today. This is not as unrealistic a scenario as some would like to think.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this was really cool. the hints recharged just fast enough so if you are really stuck you have a hint
B008RV5K4U|4.0|Really liked how close they (WB) stuck to the original graphic novel. Can't wait for the next part in January, great on regular DVD,, didn't feel like I was missing anything by not getting in Blue Ray.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is really fun and just something to do, kind of addicting to say the least. I say you should get it.
0547995660|4.0|The Giver, written by Lois Lowry enables readers to take a direct look at an environment that has been completely modified by the demands of a dictatorship supremacy. Imagine what it would feel like to have no control over decisions that are made in your life; you can choose your spouse,occupation, or a specific religion to follow. Life as far as you know it is a puppet that is pulled by the strings of a higher authority. This is what life seems to be for an adolescent named Jona,his family, and other members of the society that they live in. Jona and others have been given a false perception that the life chosen for them is the perfect life, simply because every decision has been made for them effectively by a group of elders so that they will make no mistakes. Children ranging from the ages of 4-12 have been given a premature rights of passage, meaning that they are assuming the roles of adults before they can fully understand them. Jona, due to his intellectual ability and strong personal characteristics assumes a role given by the elders as a receiver. Jona is responsible for disregarding all of the negative memories consumed by the people in his society in order to keep their world in perfect operating condition. In meeting the demands of this position, Jona is left to wonder about his own personal sanity and the people who are colse to him. The Giver is an unique tale of a struggle between individuality and direct supremacy. It gives the reader a precise look at the effects of a society that strives to mainstream life experiences into one category. Lowry provides in-depth look at an alternative lifestyle that many people in America and some other countries across the world are accustom to living.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|our daughter in law loves dogs and this was the perfect stocking stuffer for her . I am sure she will love it
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I got tired of the writer's lazy writing. She repeated much of what makes up the entire books conversations.  Example: So and so cocked his head, my scalp prickled, the way his pants fell, my face flushed, the word sub conscience, I SHOULDNT BE ABLE TO REMEMBER these of the top of my head.  I also didn't appreciate the way she glorified this abusive relationship. Too many girls will read this and will be influenced by thinking of it as sexy when really it is very disturbing.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Four different cultural perspectives of world events combined seamlessly using historical facts and people interwoven with fictional characters.  Entertainment and education in one.  Will be waiting for the 3rd book of the trilogy.
B00540G3G6|5.0|Awesome 3D remake of a classic movie. Graphics were phenomenal and everything worked great! I was very pleased with this purchase!
0743298039|5.0|This story is a literary masterpiece.  The plot is well crafted, the characters are 3-dimensional, the prose stye is worth reading and it's a page turner with suspense....all of the elements one seeks.<br />Wish Diane had written others and I'm anticipating a future novel.
B009DT98RK|5.0|It is great to be able to have this songs in 5.1 surround, with outstanding quality.  The guitar playing is just amazing, specially on the last track.<br /><br />A great experience and well shot.  I especially like concert recordings and videos, and this is one of the best.
0345803485|4.0|This is a really good read for those who don't mind reading about another set of lover's good times! I mean, I've read way hard core-er books (lol I know it's not a word!) but this is a really good intro into that world of good reads. Seller sent this off almost immediately and I got it in no time!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Is Avatar \\"EXTENDED EDITION\\" available in \\"3D\\"?<br /><br />If not - does anyone know if this will be an option in future and when it may be available?
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I downloaded this app coz I love HK. Now I have this installed in my phone; iPad and Kindle fire. I spent the Money to hire staff on the Kindle ; but the iPhone version gives you the free cakemaker if you sign in with Facebook, so I am getting by without having to spend money.  You can accumulate heart points and coins daily so technically you can hire one minor staff every 30 days or a major character every 50 days. On the iPhone version you also have the daily free spin where you can win either coins or heart points, so you can advance a little faster.  When will they upgrade the Kindle and Google version to incorporate the free spin and cake maker?
B001EN71CW|5.0|Damn fox network for ever canceling this series and keeping the steamimn crap they fill the airwaves with. Damn you!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Other then the problem of it always starting when i plug it in to charge this app is ok. I hope you find this helpful.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|That's all that actually needs to be said, but there's a certain amount of words that are required before they'll print this...
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Don't waste your money!  Read the Author's Note at the end first!  It will tell you that the author didn't research the validity of anything within this book and even states &#34;Long paragraphs of fiction were used to avoid looking up facts.&#34; This tells me the author just spit ANYTHING out to fill pages and hoped to elude others to the lack of direction and storyline.  Although, the ideas presented in this book were slightly interesting in the beginning the overall read was boring with no suspense or twists to the storyline.  I wish I could get a refund!!
B0094OLFUW|5.0|Loved The XX since their first album, and I heard their stuff on Youtube before purchasing this album. In terms of music choices, it is pretty similar to their first album, but that's what I like. I guess, rather than reading this review and deciding if you want to get the album, you should probably go listen to their songs first?
055358894X|5.0|It doesn't seem possible to have this much fun in one single book!!<br />But I just could not put it down because I absolutely had to know what happened!!!<br />What an awesome cast of characters that I will never forget!!!!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I was fascinated by the interplay between history and fiction as described through the lives of  American, British,Welsh and German families living during the rise of facism and communism. It is welcome follow up to  &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; Can't wait for the next in this series.
B007SGM084|5.0|Could Christian really be so Hot!!! Oh yeah!!! Lots of racy hot sex with a really beautiful love story !!! Ana teaches him about love and he teaches her all manner of really delicious things that neither can get enough of!!!
B0055B7K7A|5.0|This the third time I watched this movie since it came out in the theater.  It is a classic.  Enjoy the adventure.
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|WD 2go is a great app, which allows you to sync items from your dropbox.com account to your Kindle Fire. App is easy to use and works really well. I would recommend this app to anyone wanting to sync files between their Kindle Fire and a computer.
0307744434|5.0|A beautiful book, just beautiful.  Not much more to say except treat yourself to the world of The Night Circus.  An intriguing plot, gorgeous details, and just the right spirituality to inspire and give rise to many discussions without being heavy handed.  My daughter and I discussed the creation of marriage and friendships and how they manifest for a long while on the phone after I finished this book (at her recommendation).  It has it all and I have to believe there is a movie in the works; hopefully directed by someone like Tim Burton.  The ending swept me up, brought me to tears and left me with some wonderful quotes on story telling and creating art in general.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Cute movie, though not very deep. Decent for background noise as you can tune in at any point and know exactly what's going on.
B007EECSFA|5.0|It is a wonderfully written, unique story-line!  I really, really enjoyed it!  I look forward to reading more of her books
B0053O89IS|4.0|I was very excited to get the 7th season of Bones, my husband and I have grown to enjoy it very much.<br />It had alot more personal / relational aspects in the season and a bit less on the solving cases, but was still all in all very good.<br />We were pretty disappointed that it only had 13 episodes when the others average 20 or more.
B0040HERTY|5.0|With the next installment due in summer now is a good time to get back together with John McClaine!  Fun.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I enjoy album much more over their previous.  The various instruments and speeds of the music is wonderful.  Perfect for driving or just listening to at home.

B0088EDMMS|5.0|Item shipped quickly and is in good shape. One of my fave holiday movies.  It is a funny and entertaining family friendly classic.
B007HACDLK|4.0|entertaining read....just wish there would've been a little more on the tail-end of the story.  Wrapped up a little too neatly and too quickly.  Mitch Rapp continues to be my favorite character, so more is always better.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|My sister and I are always waiting for the older musicals to come out in blu ray.  This is a delight.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Ads are displayed in multiple ways/popups, and often make the game impossible to play. You can't play while offline, or even with a poor quality connection. Many, many screens are boring and/or way too easy.
B0017HMF6W|3.0|We love this movie but it will only play on one of our blu ray players.  I am very disappointed..
141659521X|4.0|Haven't received it yet however I am a fan of Vince Flynn and expect to like this book.  I ordered it for my husband who is also a fan and read the positive reviews prior to ordering.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|This has turned into a favorite in our home.  The film is produced and filmed beautifully.  Great guy for us.
034580404X|5.0|All positive things to say about the trilogy I received, and the best way to buy it to read instead of at a regular store
B002VECM72|5.0|After seeing this movie on TV, I decided it would be a good addition to our movie and blu ray collection.
0545265355|5.0|I have no complaints about this trilogy and feel it was very good price to pay for the three books I received.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|The movie was really good in the theater.  I had problems playing the blu-ray on our one player but it works on the other okay.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I actually enjoyed watching this movie and would watch it again good action and finishes the story very well must see
B007KUFDBY|5.0|The product was perfect.  This is a gem of a movie.  It's a shame more people don't appreciate the story.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Maybe just haven't had time to figure out how to do it right, but can't seem to pick the puzzle that I want and then it is hard to pick the pieces that I want.  I love puzzles, so I hope I get this figured out soon.
B004ZG5F3M|5.0|I love the story and the acting in this film.  Love Johnny Depp and Juliette Binoche in this great movie.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Does this include digital copies of all three movies? This is a great value but want to wait to see if they have digital copies because who doesn't want to watch them on there iPhone 5 on public transpiration
B001PBEJL4|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for a family member.  They love the older musicals in blu ray and were pleased with the gift.
B007EECSFA|3.0|Have enjoyed author's previous books, but this had too many decade switches --ending twist not foreseen, but you have to read it to get there.
B00198X0VS|5.0|I am a fan of the MIB series.  I couldn't pass up the newest edition of the MIB series.  Great fun.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Was surprised to be interested in this story of teen-against-the government saga.  Very imaginative !  Fast read -- a tad gory at times.
B0047685I2|5.0|Our entire family has always loved this movie.  Good story.  We enjoy the improved version with the blu ray version.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|LEAST enjoyable of trilogy.  Too much violence - not enough supporting story.  How many ways can you blow up a city ?!
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I was quite surprised how good this movie looks in blu ray.  Nice addition to our collection of movies.  Good choice.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show.  I just somehow stumbled upon it....I love the early 1900's.  After watching the first couple episodes, I was hooked!
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|This is one of those films that not everyone enjoys.  It was such an improvement over the DVD copy we've had all these years.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A very fun wholesome stranded survival story. Love lots of math in my adventure stories. I read this book start to finish in one sitting. I hope the author continues writing, nice to read real science and math in a simple style.
B005LAIGWS|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for a friend.  Not my cup of tea but they enjoyed every moment of the movie.
B001NIA27E|5.0|This movie has it all, action, danger, kids, romance, and an exciting plot.  I recommend this movie very highly.  Good gift combo?  This movie and Volcano.
B0061QD7YS|5.0|You can't truly have a Disney collection of blu ray movies without this movie being part of the full collection.
6305428220|5.0|I love Josh Hartnett so that makes this movie a plus for me.  I love the development of the characters and the &#34;monster&#34;.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|What can I say?  Ya Can't improve on perfection.  Great for traveling or times when you just need to relax.
B009JCL58G|5.0|The movie was amazing and the soundtrack brings you right back into it. Beautiful music I would recommend to everyone.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|A BIT complicated for a NEWBIE... but still more like a PC file explorer,  Worth having!  COULD be simplified a bit.
0684857219|5.0|The rest of the name on this book is not nessecary, it truely is The Bodybuilding Bible. I've used Bodybuilding.com for 6 months, and I have had better resuits in the past 2 months just using this book than I have had ever. Great book, but it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|A BIT different from seeing FB on a PC and takes some getting used to.. but over all not bad.  I would suggest it to people with Kindle products
B00942S4OY|4.0|I'm enjoying the songs.  I like this cd, and I listen to it often. One Direction just sings really good.
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS was a NEW one to me and takes a BIT more skill and coordination than &#34;Angry Birds&#34; etc,  but VERY enjoyable and super well done.  GET this one!!
B006ZZAMWK|4.0|eThere's really good music in here, I liked the song and I'm still enjoying listening to them. I love this Cd.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham's books. The story keeps you intrigued until the very last page. I really enjoyed this one !!
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Keeping an open mind this movie was awesome! They did a wonderful job blending history and fiction together in a way that was believable!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was the last one in the series so it was very nice to know how the storyline ended, but in my opinion it was the weakest of the three novels.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Don't miss out on this book. The book cover is terrible. But I laughed, cried and felt hope and despair along with the characters. This book has left an impact on me like very few books do. Start Reading this now!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not as great as the first one, but a very close second. Still has that gripping quality. A good sequel, overall.
B007BT0RKG|3.0|I was looking for something that would be useful to locate places, before I get going on road trips. But it was okay. I wanted something that would be of some use.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Predictable plot,the acting was good and the visuals were why we watched the movie.It would be nice to see more stories by this group.
0486406482|5.0|This may very well be my second favorite Jane Austen book.  The plot is ingenious, and the characters are hilarious.  Dover does a good job of publishing, and this book is no exception.  I highly recommend Emma!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Have read all the Reacher novels and am a big fan, that is until this one. Don't waste your cred, Lee, it's just nowhere near up to your standards. Predictable, boring and forgettable.<br />BTW, are we really supposed to totally suspend disbelief... Tom Cruise as Reacher!!!! yikes! He's supposed to be 6'5\\" not 5'6\\"
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This was my first experience with Amazon on demand video - I had lost this episode of Criminal Minds on my<br />DVR receiver.  We downloaded it and it worked perfectly - I am impressed.  And, as is the norm with Criminal<br />Minds, the program was a great show and very gripping.  I totally recommend this episode and Amazon on demand.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Love Johnny Depp! I liked the story line and humor in this flick. Can't beat Johnny in a Tim Burton movie
B008673ZAQ|5.0|such a great book can't wait for the next this author can write !!! She makes you feel like you are right there in person !!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Nice to have it on my kindle so I don't have to go hunting for the program and wait to log in
1419702238|3.0|this had a lot of color pencil and pencil markings in it. pages were not torn and markings were erasable.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely!  But what is funny is that I didn't like either of the main characters!! I don't think i've ever liked a story without liking someone!! both characters are manipulative and use the police and media to their advantage.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|some of the innuendos would probably make some parents a bit annoyed. I mean, as someone in their early 20s I found the movie silly-funny. Think Adventure Time sort of jokes- &#34;i'll punch you in the boobs&#34;, &#34;i don't have boobs, i have pectorials.....ow my boobs&#34;. Or my favorite &#34;mr. pendergrass appeared to me in the bathroom&#34;...&#34;ew&#34;..&#34;no not like that..&#34;<br />It isn't as dark as Coraline, gets slightly gross (had me say ew a few times) but isn't too scary for say 9 yr olds.<br /><br />Film note: NOT related to Tim Burton. I know when people think stop motion he comes to mind. Also the stop motion is very smooth, don't think of Nightmare Before Christmas.
030758836X|4.0|I picked Gone Girl up and couldn't put it down until I was done. If you require fairy tale endings you will not like this book. When I finished it I was shocked but it is the right ending for these characters. Are the characters likeable? NO. But the plot is original, the prose is good and the story is addictive. I feel that the author had the guts to finish it uncomfortably real in a way I never predicted but ultimatley came to believe was perfect. Are all of the details 100% realistic? Some may stretch plausibility but if we eliminate any book that does we lose a lot of enjoyable literature. I give this book 2 thumbs up.
B006O6F932|5.0|It keeps my daughter and her friends entertained.  It is a little bit &#34;weak&#34; from the point of view that if you accidentaly move it or hit it, all the pieces fall down .  But other than that, it is worth it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I enjoy playing it with my daughters. It's  easy and fun for any ages and you earn points and money fast.
B000Q8QH0I|4.0|I have the Blu-Ray edition from September 2008,the transfer is not hi def, it is somewhere between VHS tape and DVD.  I had the DVD and wanted the Blu-Ray edition and I think the DVD was a better transfer.  The movie starts out looking like a bad transfer, in the early part of it when Russell Crowe is talking to David Strathairn, David is almost black and the background is almost white.  A total screw up on the transfer.  I own a lot of Blu-Rays and this is one of the worst transfers I have seen.  Warner Bros. should be ashamed of themselves for producing junk!  Wait for a decent transfer.
B00555X8OA|5.0|With lively and straight forward rhetoric, Kahneman indulges us with a penetrating introspection on how we think and subsequently behave. This should be required reading for elementary schoolers, positively impacting children's life choices. If you are not up on this new, exciting field of brain research, the new, surprising theories are clearly and thoroughly explained. After reading the book, it is clear why communication at work frequently misfired. Now I ask subordinates to repeat back instructions to ensure that they didn't think that I was simply confirming what they wanted to hear.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|Grace has awakened to the feeling &#34;I was trapped under the hull of a vast ship wrecked on the ocean floor&#34;.  She remembers a terrible fire and her fight to rescue her daughter, Jenny, who was trapped.  They both are brought to the hospital.  Grace has catastrophic brain injuries and Jenny has external and internal burns.  They both leave their bodies and meet each other.  At one point Jenny begins to die, and my title is her description of how it felt.  When they discover that Jenny's small brother is being blamed for arson that caused the fire, Jenny and Grace go in search of the truth.  The action plot rests in their family's drive to find the truth.<br /><br />Unable to talk to the living, they float through the world together.they come to think they are perhaps angels.  Grace feels that angels are mothers who have left children behind.  In their struggle to understand their state, the nature of love and life are explored.<br /><br />I found myself engrossed with this book.  The characters are revealed in depth.  The plot is slippery and character driven. The themes of life after death are not intrusive or preachy.  They appealed to me, and set me to some interesting lines of thought.  Can't ask for much more from a book.
B0089AD8IO|4.0|Christopher Eccleston, assuming the role of the Doctor after the cataclysmic Time War, is the first Doctor of the reboot of Doctor Who. He does an astounding job as the titular character, not only bringing the feeling of being the silly Time Lord back but also assuming the role of a war-weary veteran.<br /><br />However, Billie Piper's character, Rose Tyler, is one of the most obnoxious Mary Sue characters to be the unknowing sidekick to the Doctor. She's a dumb blonde whenever she should be saved by the Doctor, will flirt with ANY male character, and continually does phenomenally stupid things to the point that Christopher Eccleston's Doctor should have simply taken her home and left her there.<br /><br />All this said about Rose Tyler, though, the First Series of Doctor Who has great episodes such as Dalek and The Empty Child, and is definitely worth putting up with watching Rose being a nitwit.
B002GYS1FY|5.0|Terrible packaging. I believe this was UPS and not amazon. The Box looked like it had been used as a football. I really wanted to hear this vinyl so I couldn't just return it. I was glad to find that despite so damage to the vinyl sleeve the vinyl itself was still intact and it was glorious. I'll just call the damage character and enjoy my vinyl.
034580404X|5.0|I had this trilogy on my Kindle Fire for months, but could never commit to reading it. I was not sure I could get into it because of what I had heard about these books. WELL, was I wrong! I could not put these books down from start to finish, ended up reading the whole trilogy in 5 days. I absolutely loved the characters and the story behind them. I only wish book 3 would have not left so much out. As some have mentioned, the last book seemed rushed or like the author got bored. So many things left out and a lot of loose ends. But overall still good. Who could'nt help but fall in love with Cristian Grey? AND not for the obvious but for the underlying elements of who he is. Ana could'nt be more perfect for him, she saved his life IMO.<br /><br />I finished the books a week ago, and still find myself thinking about them and truly missing Christian & Anastasia. I would'nt mind hearing more from them and the life they live after book 3, in future books. Please Ms. James keep this love story alive!
B008ADUHKW|5.0|This is Alice Munro at her best, with 14 stories, all except one new to me.<br /><br />She writes flawless prose and crafts riveting stories.  Her characters are human and believable.  They live their lives as well as they are able, that is to say, not very well.<br /><br />Many of the stories are set in the 1940's - they are a vivid reminder of how different life was then.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|A bit slow to start but really pulls you into the story about half way through. Entertaining throughout and once thepace picks up its fun.  The sequel is better and holds your attention better.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is great but REALLY limited unless you want to pay A LOT of money to finish the game which is REALLY annoying, otherwise it is great, especially on getting ALL of the updates
B008ASLK8A|4.0|I really like Guy Richey and some of my favorite actors in this move but it was a little hard to watch at times..
B008J34466|5.0|I adore all the CDs that Pink releases.  The Truth About Love does not dissapoint.  There are some really great duets on this album as well.  I can't stop listening.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I have enjoyed reading the Scarpetta series since the beginning.  I just wish she would not continue to wrap things up in the last chapter so quick and neat.  Details - we want more details!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|We love this game on our kindle.  It is a great time filler and very addicting.  We played it so much we got all of the prizes and then had to actually sell them all off for coins because there was no longer a challenge to get prizes or puzzle pieces and the coins were regenerating too fast.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This will be a short review because I read this book last night, and don't remember anything this morning. Meaning, I get why Waking Up Married is free on Amazon, it was not a good book. I couldn't relate to any character or even sympathize with them in any way, just nada, no feelings at all. I was looking forward to reading it because of the gorgeous cover, and that gripping synopsis, but at the end of the day, I was thoroughly disappointed with it.<br /><br />  Megan & Carter Connor are both goal oriented people. Megan wanted a baby through sperm bank to avoid all the messiness of marriage, and husband, and Connor wanted a wife who doesn't love him, more like a Stepford wife. They meet, get married, and don't get a divorce. I would have gotten a divorce, and moved on for obvious reasons. I don't know why Connor was so insistent of staying married, and I've no freaking clue why Megan agreed to that disastrous proposal. She moved cross country to stay with a stranger, oh I'm sorry, her husband because he believes they are perfect together. You get my point, it was unrealistic, and a little dragging at parts.<br /><br />  Waking Up Married is a fast read, and free on Amazon, so why not click that button and get it, maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did. If not, atleast the cover is pretty to look at.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I am so in love with this CD.  I haven't taken it out of the player in my car since I recieved it.  There is a song for every mood and I especially enjoy finding the clues Taylor leaves in the disc jacket.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I Like this product, it looks really good, the only thing I would like to improve on is the closure. I would put something like an elastic band or a magnet to keep it closed. Since it looks like a book, a diary clasp would be cute. But otherwise this is a good product
B009NPA3MS|3.0|I loved Phillip from AI.  The CD is great but gets old very fast as all the songs sound very much alike.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|Overall:  This is a great piece of equipment that works very easily and reliably<br /><br />Pros:<br />Shipped incredibly fast and arrived in 1 1/2 days<br />Connected to iPad easily over Bluetooth right out of the box, no hassle at all<br />Smooth and responsive gameplay and ease of use in game menus<br />Gameloft games are less expensive than xbox or PS3<br />Love having a controller for the iPad<br /><br />Cons:<br />Only works with Gameloft games<br />Currently there are very few titles available, but they say more are coming<br />Got this as a gift, but if I had to purchase it, the price would have been too high ($79.99) for the availability of games
B0091XRRQC|4.0|Claymation has been a dying art since its creation.  Few groups do it, even fewer do it well.  Aardman is the best.  Great character development.  Love the design.  Perfect for the Monty Python lover.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Practical way of looking at why couples miss the mark. No new information, but worded in a way that most can understand without being too technical. A good read for couples or individuals.
B00881VLCE|5.0|its free plus different size puzzles and lots of choices. you can't go wrong with that.  I like. free but who doesn't
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A great read<br />Well written<br />Keeps your interest<br />Very, VERY EROTIC<br />You need more?<br />Give me a break!<br />Sandra Uher
B002VX0A40|5.0|Great gift. I bought two one for my landlords first born son and one for my second born granddaughter. They absolutely love them.<br />Much more than what I expected; the colors are so bright and the material is soft and cuddly and even though they were newborns they were attracted to their dragons immediately. The photo does not let you really know how wonderful these dragons are. They are so well put together with lots of fun surprises. Now one child is almost a toddler and he still loves his dragon. I bought the dragons because both were born in the year of the dragon. Perfect gifts. Other parents always ask where they can buy one and I lead them to Amazon.com.<br />I trust Amazon.com with all my online purchases. Thank you Amazon
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Very fun and upbeat album.  Great for at home or in the car. Rihanna is truly expanding her musical sound.
0553801473|5.0|In this long awaited novel that runs in a partially parallel timeline to A Feast For Crows, the reader learns what has been going on with Jon Snow at the wall and Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons, as well as the whereabouts of Tyrion Lannister, who vanished after he murdered his father.  From there, the storyline rejoins the full cast of characters and continues on.<br /><br />For me, this was the best book since A Game of Thrones (which is still the best one).  I loved that Daenerys, Jon Snow, and Tyrion had many chapters, as I find them to be the most interesting characters (although I found Dany indecisive and a bit tedious in this novel).  The plots move forward a bit in each location, giving some hope that the story might actually conclude one day!  One complaint I have is that the cast of characters is growing so large it is hard to keep all the storylines straight, but once you just relax and get into the story, it is a fairly minor issue.  I am now joining the anxious hordes waiting for The Winds of Winter.
B000URWYTS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  The writing was really good, story compelling and wish it wouldn't have ended.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B003Y2BMVC|5.0|This is SUCH a great treasure hunting movie. I absolutely loved it. If you're looking for an awesome remake of a classic story, this is the one.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Not the best book I've ever read... but it was a good read. I like Child's writing style and that helped.
B00271SFB6|5.0|It's James Bond at his best. The action just keeps going! It's actually kind of a prequel to Quantum of Solace. This is definitely my favorite Bond movie!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Excellent actors .. Played out well .<br />A surprise hit of a movie  ..Enjoyed  it  all the way<br />Through . Very recommended.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|This movie will be considered a cult classic by anyone who loves interaction between the realms. Guy returns from hell to save his family line. He teams up a kick-butt waitress while Hell's gate keeper (you just have to love this character despite his job title) is tracking him. Fun movie.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|I have to admit... it is a guilty pleasure of mine to read negative reviews of George R. R. Martin's A feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons.  If you familiar with the books you will find some of them very funny.  The ones for A Dance With Dragons are especially entertaining--but I digress...<br /><br />The first three books are great reads and deserve a 4 star rating but starting with A Feast for Crows, the series starts to derail.  I'll make my points briefly below:<br /><br />1.  There are too many POVs.  The story gets hopelessly bogged down as Martin adds characters, few of whom you actually care about.<br /><br />2. The story does not progress enough.  You'll learn a lot about food, settings and the characters endless family relations, but you'll see very little plot movement in a Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons.  The characters are constantly traveling and never getting anywhere.  I am convinced that Martin has no idea how to end these books.<br /><br />3. Since Martin doesn't know how to move the plot along, he relies on literary gimmicks to create tension.  You can be sure that if he spends time on a character they are going to be killed off (or at least maimed) sometime soon--and then later brought back to life.  It's OK when this happens in the first books, but it starts to get tedious as the series drags on.<br /><br />4. I want to warn people who may not know--these books have A LOT of sexual material.  If you are sensitive to that at all, then you shouldn't read them.<br /><br />Look, I would recommend this series if I felt confident Martin was going to end them in a satisfying way, but I don't think we'll be seeing a conclusion anytime soon.  I recommend that you wait to read these books until Martin is finished with the series.  If you don't, I think you'll regret all the time you spent on it by the time you finish A Feast of Crows and A Dance with Dragons.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this movie for my siblings, and they absolutely loved it! It's a wonderful family movie to watch for get togethers.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a classic.  It's intelligent, moving, thought provoking and disturbing.  The characters are real and complex.  The world is rich and engrossing.  This book is head and shoulders above most of what passes for science fiction and Fantasy these days.  I've read it many times and I still enjoy it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love this game! I've never played a game like this before. I've heard of the genre but honestly never gave it a try. Since it was a FAOTD and had so many positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I'm SO glad I did...I'm officially addicted! It's fun having to think outside the box in order to progress further into the game. The only negative thing I can think of is that it's not clear as to what the ultimate goal is and why...unless I managed to miss that part somehow.
0307352145|5.0|This is an important book on a topic that is largely ignored in our culture.  Our culture idolizes Extroversion in so many ways--children are encouraged to be bold, outgoing and assertive--to speak their minds and reject caution.  Businesses are throwing their employees into open offices where discussion and collaboration are the norm.  Meetings are frequent and filled with brainstorming.  Even our education system is rejecting contemplation and study in favor of group projects and discussion.  Our culture is on a mission to shed all inhibitions, but is this good?  Introverts are under-appreciated in the US and are often encouraged to act out of character.  Yet, as Quiet points out, the world would be much a much duller place without them.<br /><br />My husband (introvert) and I (extrovert) read this book together and found it to be extremely helpful and empowering.  My husband is in a profession that requires him to act out of character a lot, and Quiet helped us figure out some ways he can recharge and enjoy his career more.  It also helped me understand more clearly what his needs are and how to accommodate them.  If you are married to an introvert, know an introvert or are an introvert yourself read this book!
B002P79KAC|5.0|Just keeps getting better every year...and the writing is so good and so intelligent that you can watch an episode several times and catch things you didn't see the first (or even the second!) time.
B004FQX59I|5.0|I saw this movie when it was first released and was immediately captivated by Oliver Stone's masterpiece. This movie really delivers!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is Vince Flynn at his best!  Fast moving, educational and just enough personal drama to keep things interesting!  &#34;Term Limits&#34; is still my favorite, but this one may come in second or third.
1466401885|5.0|I loved the book! I could not wait to read the next one. I had to go and buy it immediatly.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|perhaps the &#34;be all things to all people&#34; mentality people have of schools could be modified a bit if the leaders seriously consider how to invest the limited education dollars AFTER considering the evidence offered in this book. I for one strongly agree, too much emohasis on judging, scoring and classifying kids without the tools and skills to do something as concrete as this about them.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|As someone who lives in San Francisco and works in Silicon Valley, I was particularly amused by the depictions of life in this part of the world.  I also love independent bookstores and worked in one for several years, so there was that level of connection too.  The story was a real page-turner and Sloan does a great job at capturing the personalities one encounters here in a slightly satirical, but certainly not cutting, tone.  My one issue with the book that bars a 5 star rating was the ending.  While still quite good, I felt it was a little rushed/anti-climactic.<br /><br />Overall, though, a great read.  You should also check out Sloan's iPhone app Fish: A Tap Essay
B007FC3AAI|5.0|This came timely so that I could get all the movies watched before going to the movies on the latest
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is much more mature than Fifty Shades of Gray.  I liked FSOG, but I loved this series alot more!  I love Sylvia Day's writing style.  I feel this story is better for us &#34;30-40&#34;  year olds.  This series is a must read for the erotic romance lover.  I can't wait for the next one!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|this game is so fun and i have a great time with it. its time killing but you have to keep up with it or your comstumers will get mad and you will get points taken away from you.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|I loved this opera because of the great story it told.  If you liked Tolkiens',  Lord of The Rings or The Silmarillian you will certainly loves this opera.  So that you don't get thrown off by the German language just change it to english.  I usually don't listen to any operas but I thought I would give it a try because of the plot and I wasn't dissapointed.
B0086700CM|5.0|its an amazing game try it out. you will have lots of fun!!!<br />the more. coins you get the faster your person goes
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the Vince Flynn books and found this book to be the best of all the rest!  Mitch Rapp is a super hero and Vince's detail to describe all the action is very informative and action packed!  Vince keeps your interest and his facts are great.  I can't wait until the next book is written.
B00845MRKE|5.0|For the one how loves this movie and the cult around it.<br />Nice model of a spinner, nice pictures, and great movies.
B004EPYZSK|1.0|My Wife got so angry she broke that dvd  especialy around the end of the movie,because so many freezes and so many times I have to wash that dvd. Nothing did help! You guys are not watching your staff? A movie as good it needs to be taking care better than that.
B007I1QUYE|5.0|Not sure what to say much more than they're all there and all on blu-ray. Great trilogy and worth owning on Blu-ray. Bought this as an upgrade from the DVD set.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|A continuation of the Outlander series, Diana Gabaldon brings to life the years following the fall at Culloden defeat.  Claire returns and the romance continues.  Diana Gabaldon is a fine writer who shows a lot of insight of the times and conditions after the defeat, interwoven with a spell binding story.  Loved it, couldn't put it down.
B002VHI8J0|1.0|it has been one of the most difficult books that i ever have tried to read.  I am still on 1% reading and just can't understand the story.  DIFFIFULT READING.  It was suggested that we read the book before watching the movie.....guess i will never see the movie!
B008YWY0HK|3.0|I have been a Disney fan since I was old enough to see their movies in the theater, I'm 46 now. Then I became a Pixar fan and have enjoyed many a family night watching Disney/Pixar movies. This movie had all the ingredients of a great film but somehow missed it. Perhaps it was that none of the men in the movie had good character? I understand that she is the first princess to not fall in love but did it have to be because no good men exsist? As a happily married woman of 21 years I refuse to believe they couldn't have a man of good character in the movie, even if it was her father!<br /><br />A side note...I loved her hair!!!

B0095XPZBC|3.0|Original entry:  12/03/2012 (the day before release)<br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />TNG season 2 is where the show really begins, even if half of season 1 remains remarkably watchable.<br /><br />Cast additions are made, existing cast roles are refined and honed, and the season takes on a darker tone.  \\"Contagion\\" deals with computer viruses (a new concept at the time), \\"Q Who\\" has the Borg, \\"Time Squared\\" deals with seeing a dire future and trying to prevent it, \\"The Icarus Factor\\" has Riker meeting up with his estranged father, \\"Loud as a Whisper\\" deals with a unique situation involving a mediator's assassination, all instantly come to mind.<br /><br />Season 2 is still varied in terms of episode tone and quality, but the producers did look at what went right in season 1.  All remaining hurdles would be dealt with by season 3, which is pretty much revered as TNG's finest and for all the right reasons...<br /><br />I'd love to give this 5 stars, especially as season 2's stronger episodes are fantastic entries into the canon.  But there are some problems, which have been discussed, and should be made known as caveats...<br /><br />A couple professional reviews, and a surfeit of information and visual samples from the site known as \\"Trekcore\\" has prompted me to post early.  I will update this review as, despite the cost of $64.99, I will splurge.  At which point I will give individual grades for each episode.  I'm hoping the actual discs fare better than what has been put on display so far...<br /><br />The remastering of season 2 was handed out to an outside agency by CBS.  And the results reported by Blu-Ray reviewers so far?<br /><br />PROS:<br />------<br /><br />* fantastic sharpness and detail for many scenes<br /><br />* fantastic color gamut for live action footage (from the pics I'd seen, which were numerous, but as the whole of the series was shot on over 25000 reels of film, averaging to be 3571 per season (maybe 3000for season 2), I suspect some of the cons will be apparent in the live action footage as well as the \\"remastered\\" f/x work:<br /><br />* a matte painting for \\"Q Who\\" for the zoom-out scene had to be re-created.  The original matte, a painting, still exists, but brush strokes would have been visible.  The new version blends slightly better and has a more detail.  The only nitpick is that, on the lower right, the same Borg model was used for two decks, despite surrounding alcoves on each deck being populated or empty.  Spot this nitpick in the screencap but a still image is more revealing than motion video.  All in all, it is FAR better than the original matte insert.<br /><br />* a close-up of the Enterprise, in CGI, for \\"Where Silence Has Lease\\" looks more accurate than the midrange shot of the off-color Enterprise in \\"Hide and Q\\".<br /><br />* in the same story, Nagillum's recompositing looks authentic to the original.  At least as a screencap - the actual scene might be a tad different (e.g. shimmering effects).<br /><br />CONS:<br />------<br />* poor shadow detail (uneven blacks, especially for recomposited f/x work - outer space is not supposed to be dark gray, with ship details being darker than outer space) - some of these bits take a moment to spot, but once you see it you're not going to get around it<br /><br />* excessive noise and grain reduction, leading to a plastic look for the characters and a general blurry look.  DO NOTE:  Some scenes' softness (e.g. some from \\"The Child\\") are due to the pan and scan techniques used at the time (camera equipment), but if the camera is not moving and the image is soft and lacking detail, that's a giveaway that excessive DNR was used.  It depends on the scene in question...<br /><br />* inaccurate screen ratio: the aspect ratio is 1.35:1 and some scenes, including the Enterprise, disappear off the edge of the screen while the planet can be seen farther to the right<br /><br />* poor compositing - in a couple of scenes, layers were put on backwards (e.g. shadow detail over the Enterprise hull)<br /><br />* poor color timing - one scene has an overly bright Borg cube, and the Enterprise warp nacelles are a bright turquoise (despite the reflection from the hull being the appropriate blue.)  The bussard collectors are a purplish-red instead of pure red.  Another scene has a shuttlecraft with bright turquoise warp nacelles as well.<br /><br />* poor f/x - CGI planets are often soft and blurry, and sometimes shadow detail and light sources don't match between elements<br /><br />UNKNOWNS:<br />---------<br />* certain effects, like the morph effect in \\"The Dauphin\\" had to be redone from scratch.  They may be better than the original or they may fall flat.<br /><br />Now it's true, some of the original footage used a poor quality 2' model for the Enterprise and its issues can be seen with perfect clarity now.  That doesn't bug me.<br /><br />True, the original footage was made on numerous types of film stock - different exposure settings and darker sets show more grain.  That does not bother me.<br /><br />But there are definite differences between original film source issues and improperly-handled remastering.  I've restored film in the past and these issues of excessive noise reduction, color timing, et al, are visible from a mile away.  Maybe the company was rushing, but their efforts make themselves look bad, and it doesn't reflect well on CBS either.<br /><br />Do note, CBS did remaster season 1, with spectacular results, and the work CBS has done on season 3 so far shows their efforts being top-notch.  So season 3 is going to be a big WIN.  Season 4 has been handed out to another agency, however.  May season 4 have better results than the poor handling of season 2.  If you're a fan of season 2 like me, be prepared for a shock.<br /><br />UPDATE 001: (12/04/2012)<br />------------------------<br /><br />Before popping in the blu-ray, I rewatched \\"Q WHO\\" and \\"Pen Pals\\" on the original DVD.  The borg ship was oversaturated in many spots (not the chroma noise present with the ship and stars in outer space, but garish greens, blues, and reds on the borg ship hull).  Many scenes had visible scan line distortion from the original editing process.  I knew that this Blu-Ray would be better in many ways, but given the standards season 1 had set, that was my focal point for this exercise... so, onto the show:<br /><br />I watched:<br /><br />\\"Q Who\\" - 5/5 for story, 4/5 for f/x.  All live action film blows away all of the problems one could find in the original SD release.  The lack of scan lines (especially the transporter room scene when they beam off the Enterprise) is refreshing, especially with the far-more-accurate color palette.  While the Borg ship is a massive improvement overall (green and other color tones/glows are subdued and look more natural), there are some angles where the cube was given too much brightness and stands out for the wrong reasons.  One scene had a poorly re-composited Enterprise, but it was fairly brief.  The existing clips of the 2' model with the turquoise nacelles are bothersome, but brief and therefore minor.  Oh, I did like the borg shield effect when the security guard's phaser hit the borg.  The 3D borg interior does not show the defect I found in the released still image with the duplicate model on two levels, and the animation seen during this pullback scene of individual elements really hits a home run.  Kudos to the production team involved! (I refuse to be anything less than objective.  There are times they did a, pardon the pun, stellar job.)<br /><br />\\"Pen Pals\\" - 4/5 for story, 3/5 for f/x.  Hannah Louise Shearer always brought something new and fresh to TNG, and usually in very good ways, though the ending of this story is what knocks down 1 point - because it wrecks the story's point of noninterference and repercussions in an attempt to be too sentimental.  But it's not unforgivable.  As for the f/x:Most f/x shots are easy on the eyes.  The main planet for the story IS soft, but not as distracting as I had originally thought.<br /><br />\\"The Dauphin\\" - 4/5 for story, 4.5/5 for f/x and restoration.  This story proves Wesley is, oh my, a human and not a wonderboy on par with the wonder twins...  Most f/x scenes work, all look nice, and the new morph effect boosts the score.  I loved the original f/x, given the time they were made in, but this is a case of getting the revamp right.  It's not overblown or excessive and feels true.  It's not the same, but it gets a pass.  The scenes with Selaya in the holodeck are sumptuous; the original footage intact.  Some DNR is present, but it wasn't as bad as the screencap I had seen prior to the official release.  The only letdowns are some exterior shots, but it's minor.<br /><br />\\"Contagion\\"-  5/5 for story, 3/5 for f/x.  Another great season 2 storyline has many f/x scenes featuring dark gray outer space instead of, you know, black.  Once again, some DNR is obtrusive, but it's not beyond redemption.  as usual, some exterior shots look a little off with bussard collector and impulse engine color, but it's minor.  And the nice touch of showing the white blip when the probe was launched from Ikonia was top-notch as well.<br /><br />So far, the season 2 Blu-Ray set DOES look better than many critiques of posted screencaps were suggesting.  Mostly because motion video hides flaws that still photos will otherwise proverbially shriek to the viewer.  One still photo represents 1/24th of a second, after all.<br /><br />-----<br />UPDATE 002: (12/06/2012)<br />------------------------<br /><br />I rewatched \\"Q Who\\" to be sure.<br /><br />One scene between Q and Guinan has its incidental music a tad loud.  Not enough to drown out dialogue, but almost...<br /><br />And some of Data's dialogue later on in the episode almost seems sped up.  Something about his voice seems slightly off.  I'm still on the fence with this bit, though.<br/><br />\\"Time Squared\\" - story: 5/5, f/x:  4/5<br /><br />The Enterprise finds an abandoned shuttle, with another Picard inside, that came mysteriously from the future!  It's a great episode, focusing on Picard and Troi (who gets some halfway decent dialogue.)<br /><br />Dark typical gray outer space shots aside, kudos to a fairly great job with the original cloud/vortex f/x.<br /><br />\\"The Schizoid Man\\" - story: 4/5, f/x 2/5:<br /><br />It's the typical sci-fi trope of putting a soul into a machine, but the dialogue and cast make its presentation very engaging.<br /><br />As for the f/x, it's pretty much standard fare.  Keep in mind that f/x is more than just the model work, it includes anything superimposed.  Every episode often had multi-pass shots to mask out background details, including bluescreen glow...  But for one scene, the viewscreen has a blue glow in the upper-right corner.  This is due to one of the scene mask elements not being applied in the remastering.  A season 2 promo also had a blue viewscreen glow (for a different episode, which I did not yet find on the released set.)<br /><br />As usual, outer space is shown in varying shades of grays or black, defying the top-notch standard season 1 gave.<br /><br />The same episode has the Enterprise saucer cutting off at the right end of the screen, with the un-distinct blue planet still trailing through (CGI was framed at 1.35:1 and the model was framed at 1.33:1.  It's fairly unobtrusive, but it should not be there. Blu-Ray has various expectations, and never mind that - on a professional level - any number of college grads could do better than this.  The same scene also reveals the (2' model) Enterprise looking somewhat squished (a random problem according to other viewers, caused during the remastering process).<br /><br />But color timing and framing issues should be the easiest to spot.  Even the uneven outer space grays could have been more easily overlooked, but CBS and zillions of other entities that restore films for professional releases have done this sort of thing right, and consistently...<br /><br />\\"Unnatural Selection\\" - story: 3/5, f/x: 2/5<br /><br />It's a half-remake of \\"The Deadly Years\\" (TOS).  Some love the episode, some hate it.<br /><br />As for the f/x, the green planet is just a blob, though the green shadow on the Enterprise is nice.  Unfortunately, shadows are a bit off (but could this be due to the original filming?).  But when the shuttle returns to the Enterprise, its  nacelles are bright turquoise.  This color doesn't stand out when the shuttle reaches the planet as badly, but come on - the glow is entirely wrong.  The color timing is off.  And, as usual, outer space is shown in varying shades of gray.<br /><br />One of the beauty passes for the Enterprise's deflector dish was a slightly greenish-blue... it's subtle, but the deflector glow has historically been the same color, so it is noticeable, and one of the extras did show the deflector having its own separate film pass, so - for this instance - the color timing was off.<br /><br />The Lantry's shuttle bays had a slight teal tinge to them as well...<br /><br />-----<br />(FINAL) UPDATE 003: (12/07/2012)<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />\\"Where Silence Has Lease\\" - f/x:  3.5/5<br /><br />The CGI probe isn't worse than the original 1988 work...<br /><br />The effort put into Nagillum's editing is fantastic.<br /><br />As always, inconsistent outer space (from black in one scene to gray in another are prevalent.)  There is some bluescreen bleed in many viewscreen scenes early on, and it's amazing that only this one episode would be replete with those instances.<br /><br />One scene, with the self destruct being programmed, has the background music a tad low...<br /><br />\\"Elementary, Dear Data\\" - f/x:  3/5.<br /><br />As usual, the inconsistency of outer space annoys, as is the use of teal in the deflector dish, instead of the original blue, in an opening shot.  But I'm increasingly used to these issues...<br /><br />It's a great story, though, and picture quality - as with most episodes' live action footage - is sharp.<br /><br />\\"Peak Performance\\" - f/x:  0/5<br /><br />The Hathaway, when first seen, had a distinctly different color (too warm a shade), and a later scene shows it being a different shade (the correct shade).<br /><br />Many viewscreen shots of Picard talking to Riker have the inserted footage having too little contrast and look somewhat faded and lacking the same color vibrance.  The inconsistency doesn't get much more obvious with these scenes.<br /><br />As for the outer space bits, let's rename this episode to something it deserves to be called:  Try \\"Teal Performance\\" instead; so many scenes had every nacelle, deflector, etc, from both Enterprise and Hathaway, being a defiant teal hue -- as a result, a great story ends up annoying to look at due to the poor quality of these ships' details.  Yes, teal/orange is a pretty combination and especially for explosions, but it's not the correct combination.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />As the days go by, more criticisms of this season 2 Blu-Ray set have become available to read.<br /><br />There are a sheer number of consistency issues that - long term - will make season 2 stand out poorly, and they are not limited to the episodes I've outlined in my review here.  The color timing, overly-bright outer space, the Enterprise model stretched/squished in various scenes, the Enterprise vanishing off the screen edge when they shouldn't, stuttering space while the ship is moving, stuttering explosion, etc...  TNG was given some great time for filming in the 1980s, and edited on videotape for financial reasons.  They took the time to film some great visuals back then, so fans of the show (and general viewers) should see a similar amount of effort made in this restoration.<br /><br />Some have said some episodes look better than others because of fan-regarded status.  Is that really a fair reason?  Name one episode from season 1 and tell me it was given sub-par time and effort because it wasn't well-received by fans?  Which could be any one of 26 episodes, since most people state season 1 is weak and full of poorly written stories.  Yet it received consistently applied, professional treatment.)<br /><br />Another point of view:  Let's say you dislike season 2; if you heard that one of your favorite shows was going to be restored and released, would you want uneven, inconsistent, and sloppy treatment applied to it?  I doubt it.<br /><br />This set is still - by no means - a consistently professional effort, given the high-profile nature of this series AND for all of the work being done to make it HD in the first place.<br /><br />Could the picture quality be better and more consistent?  Absolutely!  But does the DVD original excel in any scene compared to the Blu-Ray?  Not really, apart from color timing for the f/x shots.<br /><br />What excels in this set, by and large, are the extras, and for the overall quality of the live action footage.  The latter is inconsistent at times, but most of those issues are due to source material (grain) and not the remastering process.  90+% of the season is comprised by live action footage and I've virtually no complaints for those.<br /><br />But the f/x shots were definitely not paid attention to.  Maybe if the agency had more time to properly do the remastering, CBS is keen on having the entire show out by 2014 (rather than the original 2015 timeframe).  But I'd rather see these releases come out right; imposed timeframes for delivery, when the delivery consists of so many problems, doesn't help anyone in the end.  This isn't a marathon, and cutting corners to win doesn't make it much of a victory.<br /><br />As a result, I would probably rent this season and then purchase afterward if the material met my qualifiers, but do rent and judge for yourself.

030758836X|3.0|If you enjoy violence in your mysteries and are aroused by messed-up, scheming characters and bumbling, lead-by-the-nose cops, here ya go! On the other hand, if psychological themes interest you and you want to step up in quality and insight, read the play \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" (or see the movie with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor).  You'll see where the author lifted her theme. That play has nothing to do with Virginia Woolf, however, except that one character is a college English teacher, and the title plays on \\"the big bad wolf.\\"<br />Semi-spoiler: Unlike this book, \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" does wrap up in a satisfying way. Seems like many novels these days leave room open for a sequel or a screenplay, but that failure to commit rips off the reader at the end. I think Amy is going to kill Nick and get away with it, but that's merely what I got out of the final scenes, and other interpretations could be supported. (Still, Nick doesn't have enough tricks up his sleeve to battle Amy and win.)

It´s quite fun, the story is alright and it looks nice.<br /><br />I feel like it´s almost an Oceans 11, with less A-list actors, a little cheaper and not as intelligent. It still is worth a shot though, and it does have it´s moment, but it will never become a classic.

B007KOYEOC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read it very quickly.<br /><br />I think another series like this would be great.<br /><br />I can't wait for more books from this author.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Not a laugh riot, but not a crying movie either. It has its poignant moments interspersed with gentle humor. Enjoyable.
B007THA4FI|1.0|very poor i wish i could get my money back<br />anyone can just write a bunch of filthy words<br />not good writing
B0000549B0|5.0|This has to be Jimmy Stewart's best comedy movie.  I don't know why they don't show this on TV more.  I try to only purchase movies that you can watch over and over and still find parts that are funny and that you didn't pick up on before and this certainly qualifies.  It also contains a very good moral that being very kind is easier than being very smart.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I didn't think this book was a suspenseful as all of Flynn's other books.  I also missed the interaction between Mitch, Irene, the Pres. and all of the old characters.  It was as if Mitch was just any other hired assasin.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|Picked this up just after attending the live Unity Band tour concert.  My impression of the concert was, too loud, too many notes, not enough clarity.  The album, on the other hand, is just about perfect.  Crystal clear solos, effective dynamics.  Yeah, theres some noodling garbage stuck in, but since there's 40+ minutes of great stuff, you can just ignore the rest and still feel like you bought a full album.
B00170DEM8|5.0|It was there when we wanted it live in the moment! Just right for trimming the tree  and decking the halls
B001TCHDPS|5.0|More confident as a songwriter, better recording values, and better use of studio musicians.  An instant classic (except that it took 40 years!)
0307951529|4.0|In two day I had my book! Very entertaining and simple to get some ideas to start up your own business.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My daughter downloaded this app, and the whole family is addicted to the game.  It is a great app, and makes you want to buy the full version.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|How'd I miss this the first time around?  These songs sound like what Bob Dylan would have sounded like, if only he could sing instead of just mumble.
B004P12SSW|5.0|I don't care that much for Aguilera, but I love musicals and I was not disappointed.  It was great!  Recommend this.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I enjoyed this app, it has many sounds and you can mix them to create a combination of several sounds.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|I liked this movie so much. It kept me on my seat with all the different things that was going on in the movie. I liked that I couldn't figure out who the rat was until he let it be known...
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I love this book. It really opens up your eyes on how life is in the other realm. She explained everything very well.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|You must have this album.  It is extraordinary.  Zeppelin is in top form for this performance.  A must-have for any Zep fan.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|do NOT understand what all the hype is about this series.  Couldn't even force myself to read 40% of the book, and wasted money to purchase it.  Very disappointing, will definitely NOT purchase the rest.  I still haven't finished this and will probably just delete it from my kindle.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|My daughter has two Lamaze toys and she loves both of them.  Sir Prance A Lot is very cute and she especially likes the tail rings.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The ad is small. It is fun. word word word word word word more words five four three two one
030758836X|5.0|This was a great read.  I was intriqued by the story and couldn't put it down.  It was definitely a good mystery, and I was surprised by some of the twists.  This was the first book I've read of this author's (selected by the book club that I'm in), and I look forward to reading her other novels as well.
B0046IGOIO|5.0|This is a must have for all the doors fans all over the world. Jim Morrison voice its tainted with whisky consequences.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Same problem many others experienced. This app does not work on the Kindle Fire HD 8'9! Hopefully there will be an update soon...
0440246024|5.0|This is a story of three unusual characters in a small town, Mississippi; Willie Traynor, a young, business savvy newspaper owner with serious guts, Danny Padggit, an ignorant spoiled brat turn into a murderer from family with dirty money, and Miss Callie Ruffin, an intelligent, warm hearted, hardcore Christian Black lady with standard English accent. If you ever want to know about John Grisham's point of view on Southern living, this book will give you a good insight. There are such prejudice regarding South in this county where legalizing gay marriage and use of marijuana for an entertainment purposes is deemed as an indication of progress while emphasis on math and science education is long forgotten. If you are one of those people who think Southerners are a bunch of ignorant backward idiots trapped in time machine, do yourself a favor and stay away from this book. In this book,  John Grisham talks about segregations and discriminations that was so unjustly forced upon Black people in South and how some of them still fought hard to accomplish unthinkable success. He talks about a young white man who bravely stood against racial discrimination and legal  advantage given to rich folks. He talks about good Southern food, family, courage, good neighbors and  struggles and victories of good vs. evil, all things that are slammed and ridiculed by sophisticated media.  And I loved it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Much has been said about THE DARK KNIGHT RISES; I won't pretend that anyone reading this is coming into it without some level of bias.  After all, films as popular and polarizing as Nolan's BATMAN trilogy tend to leave a serious impression, be it positive or negative.  And naturally, no one is ever going to be satisfied with the conclusion of such a series; we must contend ourselves with the fact that Nolan ends things HIS way, if not the way each of us would have wanted.<br /><br />That being said, here is an obligatory recap of the plot: it's been several years since Batman took the fall for Harvey Dent's crimes.  Batman is no more, and Bruce Wayne has become a social recluse.  Commissioner Gordon lives every day with the guilt; he's become a \\"dinosaur,\\" a relic of an older Gotham.  The city finally knows a sense of peace...enter Bane: a ruthless criminal mastermind who seizes on Gotham's false sense of security, taking the city hostage.  The action forces Batman out of retirement, to face not only an old evil, but the understanding that even our greatest heroes must ultimately meet their end.<br /><br />RISES is not on par with THE DARK KNIGHT; suffice it to say, DARK KNIGHT is a near-impossible film to top.  If we can get beyond that, we can examine and judge this film on its own merits.  While we lack a villain as truly engaging as the Joker, we get Tom Hardy's Bane: a truly hulking, menacing, unpredictable rogue, guided by his own sense of justice. With only his eyes and his physicality, Hardy pretty much out-acts everyone here, which is saying something when you're opposite Christian Bale, giving us his best Bruce Wayne to date.  We've also got Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine returning from earlier films (the latter deserves an Oscar nomination); making welcome, if not entirely fleshed-out additions are Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, and Matthew Modine.  Aside from Hardy, the true standout of the new arrivals is Anne Hathaway's Selina Kyle, a revisionist take on Catwoman (the name is never used); Hathaway steals every scene she's in, chewing her way through the material and oozing a sense of intrigue and sensuality.  While we're never really in doubt about where her heart lies, the character is still perfectly drawn; anyone who had doubts about how Nolan would incorporate Catwoman into his world can rest easy.<br /><br />THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is not without its flaws.  As with all of Chris Nolan's blockbusters, pacing is an issue, with time changes coming swiftly and with little notification; also, the final climactic scene is filmed in \\"real time,\\" but this is only possible due to many cuts (it's basically the longest two minutes ever), and as such doesn't come off as very realistic.  Realism was what made DARK KNIGHT so suspenseful; here, realism is in shorter supply, and viewers are forced to suspend their disbelief a little longer.  Similarly, the political ideology here (it's subtextual; don't worry, Nolan isn't browbeating anyone) is at odds with the film's predecessor, making for a slightly uneven transition.  Still, all of this aside, this is a fantastic film.  Nolan's Batman saga has its ups and downs, but he ends the trilogy with a (literal) bang.  Perhaps a tad overlong, and maybe a bit too epic (following its intimately personal predecessor), THE DARK KNIGHT RISES swings for the fences and, if it doesn't hit a home run, it's at least a standing triple.  A solid conclusion to arguably the best superhero franchise of all time.onist take on Catwoman (the name is never used); Hathaway steals every scene she's in, chewing her way through the material and oozing a sense of intrigue and sensuality.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Enjoyed this one!! Grisham has perfected his craft through the years skipping the more prolonged detail telling of previous stories.  It's fast paced and  holds you in suspense!!
