B005NPLXJ4|5.0|First, let me say that I actually rate this album 3.5 stars out of 5. The only reason I officially rated it 5 was to counteract all of the exaggerated low ratings. If, in fact, its aggregate rating bumped up to 5, then I'd revise my official rating. Also, the only reason I don't rate it 4 is because it is, admittedly, a bit redundant at times.<br /><br />However, we must understand this album for what it is and for what it is not.<br /><br />It is not Master of Puppets; it is not \\"Venus in Furs;\\" it is not Metallica plays \\"Venus in Furs.\\" It's not even Metallica plays \\"Sister Ray,\\" though that would be pretty interesting even though they don't have the groove to make that work.<br /><br />It is a work of music that is based on a paradigm not common to most listeners. If Metallica was surprised at the backlash, then it's not because they think their fans will take it any which way by Metallica, but instead because they overvalued the ability of the general fanbase to accept something this different.<br /><br />When reviewers say that they aren't rejecting the album because they aren't open-minded--\\"because [they] are,\\" but that the album doesn't work, what they're actually saying is that they have an aesthetic which they expect artists to follow and lack of adherence to it means bad. In other words, the very act of asserting that they are not closed-minded is, in fact, an admission that the credibility of the assertion of their closed-mindedness is in question.<br /><br />All of this is not to say that you must love this piece of music that you very well may viscerally hate, but rather to clarify that such a reaction is not necessarily the same as the dismissal of the latest American Idol clone. Recognize the legitimate attempt at art as distinct from bumbling, and also as distinct from the old guard. Even if you don't like to witness the art, don't dismiss it out of hand. Take it honestly on its own terms, not yours0.<br /><br />I usually hate the phrase \\"don't be ahater,\\" because it's usually used in a trite fashion, as in don't hate that I like the latest pop trend. I can hate that you like it but I don't have to hate it as it is. It is it's own thing.<br /><br />But you know what? Believe me, don't believe me. I still have Lulu, and get it, and have a place for it among South of Heaven, and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, and Blues for the Red Sun, and The End Complete, and Paul's Boutique, and Transformer, and Marquee Moon, and Outlandos D'Amour and Anthems to Welkin at Dusk, and Morning Star, and The Carpenters Christmas Songs, and Dusk and Her Embrace, and White Light/White Heat, and Into the Future, and High n' Dry, and The Cleansing, and The New Order, and The 39 Chambers, and Sticky Fingers, and Ummagumma, and Dealing With It, and Live Dead, and Smile.
B009YU62H2|4.0|Not their best and certainly not of the calibre of their early stuff but makes for a decent listen.  The closest I ever thought Sound Garden would get to 'background music'
B000IZA9OE|1.0|People kept telling me that South Park was good, I have watched a couple episodes on TV and now this movie, and I have yet to see anything that is funny.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Our grandson loves his jumperoo!!!! And so do our kids, they can actually get things done while he is having a blast! He bounces for hours at a time. I highly reccomend this item.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I found this game hard to set down once I started playing. Great storyline and the puzzles are not easy. Great app!
071815892X|4.0|They had good recipes, but you can definitely find better recipes on their website or on youtube! But, I'd try some of the recipes because i haven't even heard of some of the recipes in the book
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game and its cheeper then the real thing! The only drawback is sometimes it ends the game before I can call a last minute bingo but its free so I don't worry about. I do recommend this game to any bingo lover. There are lots of diffrent cards you can play plus the slots are fun too.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I basicly love this thang I mean look at it!! I recommend it for all ages it has the most simplest instructions on how to play it I enjoy it and I'm only 10!!! :'D
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Plays seamlessly on Kindle Fire HD.  Beautiful graphics, great puzzles, and thanks for the frequent hints.  I can't wait to get back to it, and I'm not a gamer.  Five stars!
B0063M22QO|5.0|At less than a dollar (US), this game is a good way to exersize your brain without over tiring your eyes. I just wish there were more levels!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I loved all of the definitions of flowers and all the ups and downs in the relationships in this book.
B004LZFWJO|1.0|I thought I was buying the game and that is not the case. There are links to social media and help for different levels but I can't find a game.
B008EKON56|1.0|DISCLAIMER: I'm not a tech geek nor an audiophile, so please don't hate on me if you deem my comments to be stupid.<br /><br />Intrigued by the promise of better sound from my iPod for a mere $7 I went ahead and bought this little gadget. What could I lose? Sound, that's what. I tried it on an iPod Nano 7th Gen and a late model iPod classic 160 gig (not sure about the generation, but the connector fit so I assume they're compatible). The only thing that happened in both cases was that the volume was reduced by approximately 2/3. No improvement in sound quality in either case, just a drastic reduction in max volume.<br /><br />If I'm missing something here, feel free to enlighten me (but don't be mean about it).
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love playing these games.  I like the fact that it is timed and there are so many different versions.  Would<br />recommend these games for everyone over the age of 10.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Another great Harry Hole detective read.  The main character alone is worth the read for his complexity and the development.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|This was one of Matthews better B type movies,  And even though I swore up and down I would never rent another one of his movies after Magic Mike and Killer Joe I rented this one because frankly we are desperate for some good entertainment.<br /><br />Mud has a surprisingly well known cast and we thought the two young boys held their own and played their parts well.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|The characters are multifaceted, not always what they seem, and ever growing.  The series itself has very interesting storylines. A fun diversion!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Easy read. I could not put my kindle down. Can't wait for book two. Hopefully the next book comes out soon.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Got this to watch on a flight, just something to pass the time. I didn't have high expectations but I did find myself laughing out loud a few times! Definitely worth it!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game was challenging and fun. It was definitely worth it. I would highly recommend this game. Super fun game!!
B0081SKYDG|4.0|Too bad real life will never come close to it.  Great party movie; if you haven't seen it, it's shakey cam style so if you're sensitive to the stuff, warning
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|This book lets one peek at Harry and sheds some insight into the person and policeman.  The pain, confusion, happiness and sorrows of his world.  A complex yet simple individual is Harry. The complexity of Mr. Nesbo \\"Harry Hole\\" novels are trilling and keep one waiting for the next one.
0064471837|5.0|I discovered this series when I was thirteen and nine years later it is still my favourite. For me it is one of those books that are so well-written that I remember places as if I had visited them and scenes as though I had seen them. I recommend Sabriel and it's sequels Lirael and Abhorsen to everyone because if nothing else, it is a good fantasy series. The world is concrete, the dangers pressing and the characters well grounded.
B00003CXIP|5.0|My sister and I have always loved this movie, and I had bought this for her for her birthday. This is a classic, I think anybody who watches this movie will fall in love with it; it's just one of those movies.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This book, along with A Kiss of Snow, are my absolute favorites in the series.  I love the world building that Nalini does so effortlessly.  This book was looooooooooooooong awaited, and I must say (though I hate to admit that I see anything positive about waiting to read my favorite series!) the wait was well worth it.
B00E8B1358|5.0|To be honest I loved the first one too, but &#34;Retaliation&#34; brought it on full throttle. Loved the action! Loved the effects! Loved the Plot!<br />Bruce Willis Brings on his trademark performance. I can smell what the &#34;Rock&#34; is cookin (sorry couldn't help Myself)... But he does an amazing job as well. Very nice to have Actors who bring real &#34;depth&#34; to their performances. For a film that you might expect to be &#34;Campy&#34;, it truly is an amazing film! Love &#34;Lady Jane&#34;, A must see for anyone who loves action. I hope they do a third film... seems they can't go wrong with this franchise (Maybe I should wait for the third one before I say that).
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it so much. its one of my favorite games. once you buy it you get Jung tu scratch.once you play your first game then you get a rare prize
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a fun game can't stop playing it. I only been playing for a short time but enjoy it so much can't wait for the next level.
B002QCD2QO|2.0|Perhaps in 1973 a dark ending was rare enough to hook an audience.  Today they are a dime a dozen.  The two main characters were not very well developed.  Their dialogue felt pushed and pulled by the plot \\"twist\\" (which I saw coming a mile away.)  There is no logical reason that island pagans would want to draw the attention of Scotland Yard.  Cult leaders are usually more clever than that.
B009KHCT94|5.0|In the same vein as Dr. Strange Love, Iron Sky is a WONDERFUL example of political and cultural satire. A Sarah Palin type President fighting the most hated symbol of facisism....Nazis.....ON THE MOON! Great cast, wonderful execution, some of the best lines I have heard.....AND NAZIS ON THE MOON.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|This book  allowed the Author to write ion several styles and I loved the eager page turning the short letter format invoked. On top of that I was delighted by the characters and their various degrees of disfunction. Having lived in a small community before, I found the depth hidden behind what may seem like small mindedness a refresshing reminder of my own humanity. Well done Mary Ann
B001YXVOU2|2.0|Morning, Morning,<br />Feel so lonely in the morning. Fugs.<br />New Morning? It's OK. I'd rather be on Desolation Row.<br />Greatest poet of the 20th century, and one of the greats of all time. Up there with Shakespeare, Chaucer.<br />Early Dylan catches the worm, and it turns.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Best alarm ive found so far. Good features. Dont usually leave reviews.but i guess you have to to unlock features now...

B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I use adobe all the time on my other computes. I never have to &#34;sign in&#34; to open and read a document.<br />What is the deal, here?<br />My work IT department says if you're being asked to sign in to get access to an installed program it might be malware.<br />I don't want to delete adobe from my tablet but I won't be forced to give my passwords when it isn't necessary.
B00124LYHQ|5.0|A wonderful rendition of the Tennessee William's play. Phenomenal performances by Vivian Leigh and Marlon Brando. A Must See classic.
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|There was so much going on that we had a hard time connecting with the characters. Love John C Reilly and Sarah Silverman but they were flat and empty. Interesting idea, not great execution.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The historical perspective he gives is very close to the way I remember it. Also, if we could go back in time, we could improve upon it? I don't think so & he demonstrates this admirably. The part that I like the most is that it's more of a love story taking place on several levels than just saving Kennedy. He's done it again, written an excellent book.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Love it and I will read this series over and over! Addicting! I recommend this for all ages. Buy it and you will not be disappointed
B00A8MGIZG|3.0|This is a good story and it features at lot of top rated actors and actresses. It is a moving saga that covered what I would perceive thousands of years of time and it is about characters and people reincarnated over and over and how their lives and personalities change.<br /><br />It is a good story but it has one bad feature. The movie changes time settings so often and so fast that the story comes across as very choppy. It makes the theme of the movie hard to follow at times and it detracts from the actors performances and the story line itself.<br /><br />I feel that the film had a much better potential but because of the choppiness it comes across as a poorly planned and edited film. I rated it as a 3 star item. It is worth watching once to see the performances and the different characters they play but for me is has no replay value. Rent the movie and don't purchase it.
B0064W63XG|5.0|This is one of the best graphic novels I have ever consumed.  And that's saying something since I'm a graphic novel/comic book nut.  Alan Moore's &#34;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&#34; is the graphic novel art-form at its very best.  Entertaining to the max.  An intelligent read as well - Mr. Moore's attention to historical fact and detail is amazing.
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|This is an app that is helpful to seeing more of my email. My native email app only shows me new mail.
B006S08RLU|4.0|Wonderful film again from Jean-Pierre-Jeunet. I always love the worlds he creates, and in this he did well again. I especially love the garden gnome scenes, and her general acts of causing mischief to those who irritate her.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Just a really good book well written and well thought out I love the writers perspective on the world. It beautiful. It takes into account the insecurity people see in them selves  Our fears and our desires. How we feel out of control. Threw the book your really start to feel connected with the characters crying for them and feeling there emotions. If the writer ever reads this. I want to say you touched me. Thank u
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book so much I want to read absolutely everything the author has written.  I have recommended it to my book club to read.  Different than most books I have read and kept my interest to the end.  I did not want to put it down.  The characters kept my interest and being that I had just returned from Sydney, Australia was a plus although not required to enjoy.
B000SEFNMS|2.0|I bought this book because I really liked the movie, and had very high hopes for the book. I think it's a very interesting story told in an uninteresting way. I somehow feel like I am reading a very long article.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Fun. Plays like a facebook version of uno, tho. It costs &quot;tokens&quot; to play which you can earn by sharing, etc, like on facebook.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|It would have been helpful to have seen the previous superhero's movies before watching this one.  Did have a lot of action.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Its the best show ever. I watched all the episodes. I highly recommend this tv series and I think you guys will like it too.
B005L38QHA|5.0|Great mouse, very comfortable.  I replaced the steel series MMO cataclysm mouse. While this mouse has less buttons I don't notice due to the fact I didn't have all the buttons on tue cataclysm mouse keyed to a task anyhow.  The only com
B008JFUO4U|3.0|There will be some spoilers so reader beware.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. the special effects were awesome, but with technology increasing it hardly looked like it was in the future.<br />2. morgan freeman was great in this movie, but tom cruze was his same old self, he just seemed like some lunatic, that liked to move stuff in a jerky type of manor and call it acting.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. the plot was just silly, multiple jacks and his assistant repairing drones really???<br />2. all of that lead up about aliens, and guess what there were no aliens, just a huge pyramid space station that is all empty except more drones and clones of jack and his assistant. the only thing that ran it was .... Wait for it.... a smaller AI pyramid with a red eye..... seriously, is holy wood that lacking for ideas?<br />3. with the exception of the flying drones there was nothing that said future tech OMG there in the future.<br />4. ANOTHER MOVIE about them draining earth of its water for fuel, seriously??? water is the most abundant resource in the universe, yet aliens travel light years to destroy a civilization for water, they stole this idea from battle field earth.<br />5. NO ALIENS, they tried that in contact and the movie tanked.<br /><br />No ALIENS...................................
0141033576|4.0|Read it slowly. Try to understand. Observe others' and your own thinking for the points author makes.<br />The book is relatively complex to follow, not a leisurely read but it has wisdom of a lifetime.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was very annoyed with the characters, who were, at best, flawed. But increasingly, I wasn't able to put the book down. So I guess that's a good read.<br /><br />And the end? I don't think anyone would be happy with that, but who knows what might follow?
0143122916|3.0|I liked the book overall, but think it lacked in details and specifics. Too much time was spent at the end of the book chronicaling his attempt to assimilate into a democratic society. That's not why I bought the book. I wanted to know more about North Korea, their society, the gulags, etc. I'm awaiting the book &#34;Aquariums of Pyongyang&#34;. I'll see how that is compared to this book.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Same comments as for Die Trying.  But this one was very much a mystery until the end.  Like that very much
B002WD4MLG|1.0|Fabulous movie, but the buffering was horrible.  Netflix much better.  The movie kept pausing every few minutes.  Not going to order any more Amazon movies if they are going to be like this...ruins the movie.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I got the free version of this app and after one night of me sleeping with it on, I had to get the full version! It is DEFINITELY worth the price! Don't hesitate to buy it!
B001BZF9UY|5.0|Hans Zimmer's score has certainly played a key role in the success of 'The Batman' trilogy but among the three movies the soundtracks of 'The Dark Knight' stand out. Each track is unique and few of them represent the characters in the movie. I would certainly recommend it. But be aware, it is very addictive :-)
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I started with season 3 and decided to catch up. This season was fantastic. Loved the acting and the story was great. Just fun to watch.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|expected a little more.....nothing much redeeming here...boring....not funny....thought it was a comedy, not at all...all of the previews showed the only minor comedic scenes.............waste of time
B001NHNG64|3.0|read at least six of the Reacher series.  Decided to start at the beginning or first Reacher appearance.<br /><br />Still enjoy the character.
B005HSL626|5.0|Good fast game.Keeps you on you toes-trying to cut fruit and avoid the bombs and frozen bananas-love this game.Would highly recommend it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great cliff hanger ending for Season 10 - who gets shot - can't wait for Season 11 to start next month
B00CFA222M|3.0|I liked it enough.  It didn't grab me and not let go like some movies do.  I didn't have a problem getting up and going to the frig.  I don't mind movies like that but I'd rather be glued to my seat and this didn't do it.<br />I like all of the actors and they did a fine job.  The entire film was well done.  Maybe they should have tried for medium-rare.
B007IWG3WC|4.0|Great shark movie everyone should visit on amazon prime.  So if you like shark movies this is the one to watch.
1451695195|5.0|I was deeply moved by this book. Dr. Alexander's story is so wonderful it inspired my faith in the afterlife.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|This Blu Ray transfer was well done and brought out details that I had missed before. It is a famous movie so I can add little there but the Blu Ray version was worth my money.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Can not write a review on a game that will not come on. When I press  start nothing happens on my Kindle.
6305428352|4.0|Life is what happens when your busy making other plans.  Sometimes your dreams do come true,  when you open your heart and your mind.  Loved it!
B00B6U63ZE|3.0|For such a highly rated and recommended book I found the writing itself to be a bore. It's a personal preference but nothing really hit home with me. It lacked the relation to a more empirical yet disciplined approach to moving in as new management.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|I was on board until the author completely trashed God. God is certainly not a man made myth. I had to laugh after reading the first experiment! Imagine demanding  a &#34;miracle&#34; and giving a time limit (48  hours) for it to happen! God performs miracles in my life on a daily basis! Experiment 2, I chose green cars rather than the suggested color because I'm not even sure what that Is. I did see many green cars during the 24 hour period, but yellow butterflies was a whole different story. I'm still waiting. Anyway, after that I had enough!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Again the story progresses and each character is explored and has a stand alone story.  This is truly a masterpiece and I look forward to more episodes each year.  I know it will end and maybe then I will go back and look at it all again.  Of course we purchased them all. Saundra Gray
B008Y73940|5.0|interesting, kept my attention, what more can I say, saw it twice, will see it again if I have the time

B000QI2ZWW|5.0|This is such a darlying show that has  great message and no typical villain like most childrens movies.  I can feel good about letting my 3 year old watch it.
140006922X|4.0|For a step-by-step history of how a tiny Jewish sect became a world religion, \\"Zealot\\" gives you the whole story in a smart and engaging way. Much like the humorous history of Christianity, [[ASIN:1439264252 What Do You Do With a Chocolate Jesus?: An Irreverent History of Christianity]], this book tells the tale of Jesus the man. While \\"Chocolate Jesus\\" covers the history up through the Middle Ages and into the founding of America, \\"Zealot\\" stays in the first century and focuses on the life and times of Jesus and Paul, the twin pillars of the faith. It's an earnest unearthing of the human origins of Christianity, with all the superstition and supernatural elements cleared out of the way, and it describes the political impact of Jesus' teachings, and how Paul went on to change what Jesus established as an offshoot of the Jewish faith into a new religion that would go on to shape and pester the entire Western world. Very readable and quite nicely done.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|If you love insightful, philosophical novels with a great story line, then you should definitely read The Alchemist. Absolutely beautiful story, and very enlightening.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|It was quite refreshing watching this movie with family, and it met all of our expectations. It is funny and entertaining, and it has an intelligent main and supporting cast. This is the second time I see Jesse Eisenberg alongside Woody Harrelson, first time being the 2009 [[ASIN:B002WY65W4 Zombieland]], and I am very impressed with their performances. As always, Morgan Freeman is great and quite a performer. The story line is also interesting, and it has all the required twist and turns to keep you interested right to the very end. If you are looking for a fun to watch movie that can be watched with family, you just found one. Enjoy!

B002C4YYEU|5.0|I love this movie,  Brad Pitt is amazing as well as all the other cast.  I think I need to watch it again since you asked me to rate it.
B000V39KDO|5.0|gerard butler is outstanding in this film...<br /><br />the entire cast is exceptional...<br /><br />i saw '300' years ago... when i saw it was available on dvd, i just had to have it...<br /><br />thank you, amazon.com...
B005VMSATA|2.0|Unless you really like Ryan Reynolds (which I do - so that's cool) this movie isn't great...it's like &#34;Thor&#34; level.  It had some funny dialogue but if you ever read the comic (or stole your brother's like I did) you will hate this.  Plus the CGI mask is really baaaaaad.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Every song a winner. I really enjoy this CD. I forgot how good they sounded and how the songs hold up.

B001TH16DS|5.0|I've been on a Nerdfest all weekend! Watching this season over some beers all weekend and I can't express how much I've missed the original season! I've been watching the enhanced versions and I have no complaints! The only thing they digitally fixed are the space shots and some distant landscape views. They look great!! Plus, it gives you the option of going from the unenhanced version of the show to the enhanced! The only complaint I have is with the sound. When Kirk narrates in the beginning, the sound is really low and then the music blares at times. I have to keep adjusting the volume. No,it has nothing to do with the drinking! LOL. Love this bluray season and I look forward to purchasing and watching the next 2 seasons!!! A must for any Star Trek fan!

B0089LOG02|2.0|This was listed as a Christian novel and that's why I purchased it.  In my opinion, it's not even close to being what I consider an enjoying read much less a Christian novel.  The story was intriguing as far as I read, but I returned the purchase since that kind of language is totally offensive to me.  I'll find my books some other way than taking for granted the category is what it says it is.
B002ZG4Q5W|3.0|This should have been AK's best movie, and many parts of it are absolutely astounding. However, the poor casting choices of Nakadai and Pita completely ruin many scenes, which get so tedious to watch, that I was literally praying for the scene to end so that I could get more of Mieko Harada or Daisuke Ryû -- the two actors in this movie who give absolutely mesmerizing performances.<br /><br />Tatsuya Nakadai as Lord H completely overacts his part, and the unconvincing makeup and hair on him just make him look ridiculous. And then, well where do I start with the inexplicable idiotic portrayal of the Jester/Nurse by Pita? The unconvincing constant moaning and tantrums by Pita as this character were both painful and boring to watch.<br /><br />Given the time that the movie was produced, AK should have made-up with Mifune (who was in his 60's then) and cast him as Lord H. Mifune would have nailed this role. Nakadai comes across like some buffonish rock star who did too much LSD in the 60's, with obviously a fake-looking wig, and really odd make-up that makes him look white -- he looked utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />And Pita, with those ridiculous looking \\"1970's era pajamas,\\" plus the unconvincing change of moods and constant whining, was just inane to watch. Seldom in an AK film have I ever kept wishing for a stray arrow or an enemies katana to strike down a primary character. I do think a much better actor could have been cast in this role; but I also think that this role was not thought out and written very well as well -- but here again, a much more experienced actor could have worked with AK to successfully make this a more convincing character in the film.<br /><br />So in summary, the inept performances of Nakadai and Pita keep this film from becoming an AK masterpiece.<br /><br />This movie proves that the importance of having a great Casting Director should never be underestimated. AK did not have many faults, but in this case, his habit of serving as his owncasting director came back to bite him in the keyster.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Big Mahjong fan....been having lots of fun with this version.  No problems with it yet on my Kindle Fire..Nice app Amazon.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|thiis is great for a person like me who cat naps more than sleep. I have the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Tab and it works fine
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game alot. It is easy to play and is great for passing the time. My son likes to get a few<br />moves in too.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Love this series, Diana never let's you down, always a page turner. Can not wait to finish the  entire series
B001DHXT6G|5.0|TOS --- digitally enhanced makes for a contemporary sci-fi viewing experience. However the episodic plots, morality themes, music and acting make this one of the best (talking top 10 here boys and girls) if not ageless TV series in history.
B008220C38|5.0|I've never read the original novel so I can't make a legitimate claim, but I absolutely loved this movie.  At first the artistic transitions between scenes disoriented me, but pretty soon I appreciated them for their loveliness.  The actors were also all lovely and pretty.  To sum up this movie in a shallow way: eye-candy aplenty.  I think the best love stories don't become the best without tragedy.  And it's more than just a love story, because there is family and society -- all made up of characters that are extremely likable.
B005544TRQ|5.0|A great escape from reality.  Excellent cast.  Wonderful interaction between characters.  Fun and occasionally a real life lesson.  Need more episodes available on PRIME.
B0007TKNII|5.0|To use a quote I saw on Pinterest, &#34;I am in a complicated relationship with a fictional character&#34;,,,that being PHANTOM!!  I think this movie is awesome.  I enjoy all the characters, but especially Gerard Butler.  I have read where others have said that he doesn't have the talent for singing, but I think they are just WRONG!  He sings with such emotion that I don't see how anyone could fault him for not being opera-perfect.  Who cares?  It's the person who can make you FEEL that has the real talent.  'Nuff said. The movie is worth every penny I spent on it...and so much more!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|They totally changed the game. Took items from players. Made rooms harder so you would spend more money.  People fight over items in rooms. Not fun anymore. Very sad. The game also freezes. You lose the items you won. Most importantly, if i try to purchase credits or coins you get charged but never receive what you purchases. This is why i purchase on Amazon and not facebook. Amazon has great customer service and has refunded my account 4 times. The game is becoming a real pain when it should be fun!
0062101897|5.0|Just how much information is too much information? This is something each fan of the Harry Potter movies need to ask themselves before buying the book. Harry Potter Page To Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey is a book that promises to do exactly like the title says. It gives the complete story of the filmmaking process of the Harry Potter movie franchise. Do some people, who've probably closed the chapter to that part of their life when the last movie came out last July, actually want to know everything about the films that looked so magical on screen? There is, after all, always the danger of being disillusioned after getting to know a certain thing (or a person) to the minutest detail. Familiarity, they say, often breeds contempt.<br /><br />Furthermore, seeing as there are some people who don't really adore the movie adaptations by Warner Bros. of JK Rowling's beloved novels, those who find the film series lacking should probably steer clear off the book. It's wordy, heavy and, yes, bloody hell, pricey. Not only could you actually break someone's toes if you accidentally drop it on their feet), you might actually break your own wallet buying the book. These people might end up hating the films instead of loving them if they were forced to buy the book.<br /><br />Having said that, if you are a fan of the movies or at least fans of the people working in the 8 HP movies, this is the one book you simply must have. If Harry Potter: Film Wizardry by Brian Sibley is the fan's ultimate fun book, this is the budding filmmaker's ultimate textbook on how to make an epic franchise that lasts a whole decade. Whatever shortcomings the films have, you can not deny that a lot of thought went into the making of the films. From casting to scriptwriting to designing sets and characters, this book reveals all of them.<br /><br />There are exclusive photographs of the actors and the crew. There's a list of the actors' heights at the start of the franchise, in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. There's sketches of Dobby and Kreacher and Quidditch. There are concept arts. There are costumes. There are character references. This book is what happens when someone converts all the behind-the-scenes portion of the DVDs into writings on the printed papers of a hardbound tome. (And the DVD's extra features still can't compete with even half of the book.)<br /><br />A serious Potter collector will want this book to put on their bookshelf next to the Rowling novels. A casual Potter fan will want to borrow this book from a friend who's a serious Potter collector. Either way, this might be the very last Potter-related book to be published for a while. Now that this book is out, as well as the DVD for the last movie, the Harry Potter saga comes to an end. We hope that there will be more but, just in case there's not, do pull out $75 from your bank accounts and use the cash for the book. Despite the mass, the oversharing and the price, it is a book well worth your time and dime.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|This is a great read and lots of fun. It would have been good with a few more chapters at the end to go into more depth about each experiment and perhaps if one didn't work, why, and what to do - a journey I will embark on myself. But thanks Pam, I now see green cars all day, every day, and am waiting for that purple feather to appear! (readers will get that one).
B008M7JODC|5.0|interesting and love the actors and their chemistry. worth the time, just have to get past the gore of the first few episodes
B00DL47A6O|5.0|I'm not writing a full review because I don't have time for that bs. All that needs to be said is this movie as a thriller will keep you thinking. The acting is very good although not perfect and its got some above average cinematography. Watch it if you are looking for a thriller with the beautiful Rachel mcadams from mean girls or you just like thought provoking film
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I read this book to keep track of what my 7th grader had to read as her summer reading requirement . I ,for one, like the concept that the author has dealt with. The struggle and fantasy that a child deals with while growing up. The struggle with how things stand and the fantasy of what they would ideally have it as. Well, don't we all crave for that \\"elsewhere\\"... However, when my twelve year old reads it, she gets very involved with the characters and the pain they feel; and I could see that the symbolism was lost on her. I would still recommend this book as it brings about a certain maturing and  provokes questioning. I hope the book generates some debate in the classroom.
B002RUA524|4.0|Fun, colorful language, good book for both kids and grown-ups. Also gives a good overview of the Corfu island as a travel destination.
0062215507|5.0|With the end of the Harry Potter film franchise nearing, it seemed the right time to go back and savour the highlights of the ten-year long series. Harry Potter: Film Wizardry does just that: a scrapbook that encompassed the decade-long saga, where everyone from the producers, directors, and production designer explain in details how they conceptualised some of the plot points and settings; and the actors, including the three stars, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, hit memory lane to disclose some of the best, funniest, and sometimes most uncomfortable times they had playing Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the films.<br /><br />The book begins with a foreward from Dan, Rupert, and Emma, who gush about how much of an impact the series made in their lives. Dan remarked on the journey both he and Harry endured in the ten years; Rupert took pride in playing brave Ron Weasley, the \\"ultimate ginger,\\" in his words; and Emma voiced her respect for her young, annoying, brainy Muggle-born fictional counterpart she thought she had nothing in common with early in the series, but who she embraced with all her heart by the end. It then lead into the first of many producer's notes scattered throughout the book, where David Heyman, the man who read the first Harry Potter book, fell in love, and immediately insisted on making the films, explained how he began to piece the movies together well over ten years ago.<br /><br />Author Brian Sibley compiled the scrapbook with a combination of production notes, countless cast and crew interviews, set visits, knowledge of the book and film series, and production photos and movie stills to make the quintessential anthology of the Harry Potter film series. The book itself ended with a sneak preview of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, with nothing more than image captions under a dozen or so small photos from Gringotts and Hogwarts. Just enough of a teaser to make the reader wish there were a few more pages at the end, chronicling the end of the saga.<br /><br />One of best features of the book, however, was that it focuses on so many of the minor details fans could never have been expected to notice, and the production teams that worked endlessly to make them. Here you have clear shots of Daily Prophetarticles and issues, rooms filled with creatures like Buckbeak and thestrals, various angles of the Room of Requirement both from Order of the Phoenix and Deathly Hallows: Part II, Privet Drive and Diagon Alley, and countless rooms, corridors, and facets from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. (I definitely wished there were more photos than only the sneak-peek of Gringotts).<br /><br />\\"Everybody involved in these eight films knows that we have been part of something very special, and that there will never be another experience like this one,\\" proclaims producer David Heyman in the introduction. He's right, of course, and while the people who made the movies were there for births, marriages, divorces and even deaths, fans have been along for the ride, hoping for a chance to sit in the front seat. This is finally it!<br /><br />From tidbits like how Helena Bonham Carter perforated Matthew Lewis's eardrum with her magic wand in Order of the Phoenix, to grand designs like how the filmmakers created an entire Hogsmeade miniature village with intricately detailed micro-window displays the size of a £1 note, the book simply doesn't disappoint. It's the perfect mix of fact and -- as McGonagall would say -- \\"well-mannered frivolity.\\"<br /><br />On top of all that publisher Harper-Collins inserted over half a dozen prop replicas, like your very own sealed invitation to attend Hogwarts (addressed to Mr H Potter, The Cupboard under the Stairs, naturally), a Quidditch World Cup programme, and even a \\"real\\" Maurader's Map. There are also several fold-out pages, one of which contains the Black Family Tree Tapestry.<br /><br />I highly recommend 'Harry Potter Film Wizardry' for any passionate Harry Potter fan, from one proud owner of this marvelous book to you all.
B00CEK9OTM|2.0|Core Dive was fun for a while, but the sound was off from the action by an annoying margin; it did not have a lot of fun additions to the levels to add excitement, and my neck hurt from having to lean over the screen since you can't calibrate it from any position (it has to be level).
B005KMX866|5.0|I'm just going to be honest here -<br /><br />I have listened to Chris Isaak over the years but never really got into his music (although I loved Wicked Game once upon a time - am sick of it now, though). He's very talented and incredibly handsome.  His smooth, velvety voice (when he sings softly) and retro style is what makes his music worth listening to, but some of his past music videos are a real turn off to me because they're just too sexually charged for my liking.<br /><br />I didn't really keep up with his music because of that, so I guess a couple of years must have gone by since the release of this album before I heard about it - and when I did, I checked out some interviews that were posted on youtube before deciding to buy this - and even then, it sat in my Amazon cart for weeks before I went ahead and actually made the purchase.<br /><br />When I played it, I was pleasantly surprised!  Wow!<br /><br />He performs these classic songs in the spirit and style with which they were written - and he does a beautiful job! I could not believe my ears!<br /><br />THIS is what he was cut out to do, and it is - by far - his best work ever.  These songs fit him like a glove - and with his retro style (which I really like, by the way) it's a perfect match all around.  The way he just breathed life into these old classics while preserving their essence is remarkable.  I think the original artists, who are no longer with us, are smiling down on him right now, and I'm betting that the ones who are still with us are rather impressed.<br /><br />I'd also like to state that this is an album that I'm not hesitant to let my kids listen to - my 8 year old is suddenly a big Chris Isaak fan now - her favorite songs on the album are Crazy Arms and Ring of Fire.  So there you have it - a terrific work of art by Chris Isaak that is suitable for the whole family.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|At first i had no idea what to do. As soon as i got the concept wich is to find clues in the room that lead to other clues ultimately leading you to get oht of the room and move to another....it's so much fun and i love that its challenging.
B000FVQLRA|4.0|Few can imagine the task of day to day survival during this ordeal. Time helps many to forget the horrors of the time, but the modern world should never forget what happened at the hands of fanatics. History forgotten will repeat itself. We must never fail to remember.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The book is a good read... Starts off alittle slow but it kept my interest to the end. It's worth a read. Enjoy!
B009KUWWW0|5.0|I absolutely hated to see this book end.  I learned so much about the 1300s, and the role of government & the church.  The characters had such unique personalities, and I could imagine how each of them could act the way they did.  Got to see up close personalities that I would never come across in my everyday life.
0385504209|5.0|Detractors pan the writing and research, but this story does make you stop and think. It was interesting and a darn good book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so cool you should get it you get a lot of coins and you can buy more mini games
B004UC4HCG|5.0|This unit is designed very well. I max'd it out with an Intel Core i7 3770K 3.5G processor and 32GB of ram. Running all day and serving large files, this unit blows just slightly warm air. The CPU heatsink has a fan blown radiator for efficient liquid cooling. This is such a compact form factor it can be placed anywhere.  It is so quiet; you don't know it's on except for the soft blue power light.  There are enough high speed external connections to satisfy most needs including eSata and HDMI.  I'm using it as a media server.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|This worked better than I thought it would. Easy to carry. The picture is steadier and I have a place for the light. I would recommend this grip for any video camera.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I love this album. And I love all of Lindsey's work. This is the first album I've purchased in which every song from the first to the last is liked. Thanks Lindsey. Highly recommended
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I purchased chromecast from Google within a few hours of its release and got ~$24 netflix rebate, hence the effective cost was only $11 for me. At that price it was a no-brainer. I use ipad and airplay extensively at home, as I am a proud cord-cutter (no cable/satellite service).  Recently I moved from an iphone to android device after five years with various versions of iphones, and needed a quick way to stream stuff from android. None of the apps on google play store provided the ease of use and smoothness of Apple TV and airplay. Chromecast is a step in right direction. In contrasting it with airplay, the main advantage is that it doesn't stream from phone, but grabs the media pointed on the phone directly from the cloud. In my opinion it is much better than airplay, as it doesn't lock the phone. You can play one video on TV and browse other videos on the phone without disruption.  The disadvantage currently is the limited App compatibility on android. Only netflix/youtube and google music and movies are supported. That comprises 80% of my media consumption. For streaming videos from other websites, Ipad-airplay-Apple TV is my backup solution.<br />I hope as the App selection expands and the platform evolves, it will be possible to completely ditch airplay and use only one platform for all media consumption.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|perfect game for me to play when I have some time to waste or just want to get away.. I love the minions
B0083DJWGO|5.0|The author is very good, for someone who read or not read the last book Black swan, this book is recommended becouse it will open your eyes for a lot of different points and ways to see things around us and how the world is built on antifragility point is really real. I changed my perception of life after read this and the last book as well.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|It had a lot of action.  Non stop from middle to end. Also had a blend of comedy and one line finishers. Overall,  who doesn't like an action movie.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is really good product. You get a new word each day along with a quote and history. Also you can hear the pronunciation of any word you research. Excellent for kids too! I would rate this a perfect 10!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|yeah lol good game... gets hard sometimes though.. so is can get frustrating sometimes :/ I keep playing it to find out what other interesting games it has.... otherwise..... rage quit.
B00633W614|5.0|I loved everything about this book. The characters were great and the story was interesting as well as  exciting. Very clever writing.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Season 3 kept me coming back ASAP to view the drama.  Various episodes were more interesting than others.  Episode 9 was boring in Scotland.  The first two seasons held more drama.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book truly takes you to the next level of positive thinking and manifesting your heart's desire. If you want to change you life, here is the blueprint!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I enjoyed the beginning of the story but then seemed to get lost. I enjoyed reading about the dynamics of different types of people who are forced to live together under tough conditions.<br />This is a good book for anyone who is interest in how people survive in another world than the one they knew so well.<br />I rated it a four because it kept my interest.  I wouldn't call it a page turned though.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Can't figure out exactly where to hit. I need more ammo if I am ever going to beat it. Fun game anyhow.
B005544V6A|5.0|The episodes are fun and interesting topics. Rarely redundant and provides an engaging plot mid way through. The characters are well developed and have good chemistry.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|Highly accurate, highly intelligent, thought provoking and THRILLING!!! This movie is a five star winner, lauded by critics and medical science community for its accurate attention to detail. This film will entertain you, and enhance both your awareness and curiosity so much, you'll be on Wikipedia for weeks! Casting is ideal and acting is better! You'll watch this again and again!!!  What is really scary is the similarity of the Nipah virus incident which originated in Malaysia in 1997, which REALLY DID HAPPEN caused by the disturbance of a bat colony by deforestation. While the Nipah virus incident was controlled before global pandemic (according to Wki), it was extremely contagious and deadly, killing most victims as well as physicians and other care providers.<br /><br />If you like steroid muscle men with no shirts, machine guns, blood and gore, zombie tales and other no plot special effects films made for double digit IQ audiences, go look for those; you'll need average or better intelligence to appreciate this film. It also doesn't waste footage on gratuitous nudity and sex; instead sticking to an intense story without getting lost on meaningless individual subplots. Just as \\"Marooned\\" was to Apollo 13, it's only a matter of time before this goes from the big screen to CNN!<br /><br />Not \\"if,\\" but \\"when!!!\\"
B005K17RU0|4.0|Better than the new Weather Channel app. The old app much more user friendly.<br />That's why we switched to the AccuWeather app
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I loved the matrix and then the second and third came out and I wasn't terribly impressed. The second has grown on me. Still waiting on the third to do so as well. Anyways, for such special effects rich movies, blu ray is the only way to go
B007THA4FI|2.0|I loved the Harry Potter series and thought I would enjoy anything she wrote.  Could not get into this particular book.
0763644765|5.0|What's so great about this book is it's simplicity and the fact that you can engage and expand the reading as much as you want to. My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves reading this book when she is on the potty!
B001VNB54A|5.0|The blue ray movies were very good quality and I have watched them several times. I would purchase more products from this seller. I served in Viet Nam and have an interest in war related movies and feel this was authentic and well done. I have had these movies for several months
B0009P5YXO|2.0|Flimsy product it broke in three days,<br />I was expecting more for that price...<br />extremely disappointed with the item and<br />the description given on Amazon
145210655X|5.0|I bought this book, along with Star Wars 123 and Star Wars ABC AND a Chewbaccha onsie.  All for a shower present for my son who is expecting his first child, a boy, in October.  He loved them all and cannot wait to read to his little guy.  The books are board books and will last until his son has a child of his own!!!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Get the entire series and you can say goodbye to your weekend.  It will pull you in.  And is helpful if you want to kill someone and dispose of their body
B004JY0KP8|5.0|There's a lot to like about this watch - my favorite... it's just a simple, quality classic. There are some peculiarities of note - mainly that the second hand is in the small dial to the left. But that's been easy for me to overlook given the stylish nature of the watch (obviously everyone prefers different things - but this is a solid pick for a classic dress watch). I've worn this with a suit and also with athletic shorts and a t-shirt. One thing I've noticed after wearing it for ~2 weeks is that the band is difficult to take off regularly - I have to pull pretty hard to get the strap loosened.<br /><br />Overall - great watch and you really can't go wrong. Solid quality!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game was a lot of fun and I will continue to play it.  I also have it on my computer and play it there too.
B00656C6KK|5.0|The crisp and clear voice of Doris Day is evident on this CD.  She knows how to select music that is perfect for her voice and a pleasure to listen to.  Always love the classics and Doris Day  doesn't disappoint
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Paul is a road story that takes a witty look at western popular culture. There are many hidden references. One that most people seem to miss is the mother ship of Paul's people is the guitar from Boston's self titled album.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Excellent movie. Tom cruise did an excellent job. Beautiful setting. To vruise did an excellent job portraying so many characters.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Felt it was not as good as the first two. Also felt things fell into place too easily; I wanted more character interaction between the parents and son.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Loved it! Really a great film.<br />The end was a little too American though, all happy, but it's still worth seeing the movie!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game as it's very addicting.  Can keep me busy for hours just like on my regular computer.  It's fun and entertaining.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It's a fast read.  I have read a few other books on this subject but always remain my agnostic self. However, for whatever reason, this book has put a tiny but effective  seed of question into my conviction.  Medically speaking,  he certainly has the credentials to know what he is talking about.  Obviously, he believes what he writes.  And, that leaves us.......where????
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game, best &quot;city&quot; game on the amazon app store. Wish i know this game sooner. Also the energy needs to regenerate faster, and showing the upgrade prize would be good.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This used to work fine on my Kindle Fire, now it opens for about two seconds and then closes. Very annoying. Please fix this! It is so useless at this point, I would give it 0 stars if I had the option.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|Christopher Reeve.  You can't get better than that (^_^)<br /><br />Makes for a great 'family movie night' film!  From the days when acting was more important than special effects and a good story was better than fancy costumes.  This one never gets old!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I fell in love with season 1 because I am a big fan of fantasy and disney. Every episode has something to offer to the general plot and keeps you wanting more after every episode. Very eager to watch the rest of the episodes in season 2, worth it!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|amazing information, inspiring advise. I found this book to be a good reference and will continue to read it as I try new techniques and exercises.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|This is the absolute best sudoku app that I've tried for my kindle. No obnoxious features and a pleasure to play.<br />Would love to see options of 12X12 and 16X16 sudoku by this same developer

0553807919|5.0|User friendly, specific and sensible ideas for helping nurture and grow emotionally and cognitively healthy kids at all ages and stages.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|Just like the first Star Trek movie this one is a great summer popcorn movie. Shut your brain off and enjoy all the pretty colors, because if you actually give any thought to anything happening on the screen it really doesn't make much sense. It's a pretty movie, it's exciting, it has a few nods to the fans and two stupid fan service moments (Kirk in bed with two women and Doctor Markus in her underwear). So if you want to shut off your brain and enjoy the action rent this movie. If you are looking for the thought provoking Star Trek of old skip this movie then.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|But its a good read regardless. Thru the book, you realize just how messed up the prison system is.  I would def recommend, but not if ur trying to find out what happens next season on netflix

031623480X|5.0|I have long been plagued by many of the health issues that Dr. Perlmutter addresses in `Grain Brain', and have been seeking answers, including reading many `health diet' books. I even attended an all-vegetarian cooking school in order to learn more about how to better my health after having cancer.  In short, THIS IS THE BOOK with the information that I have been searching for so many years for. Dr. Perlmutter is unique among doctors, because he is a board-certified Neurologist, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition (the only doctor in the country who is both), and a fellow of the American Board of Integrative and Holistic Medicine.  His book is based on his very real patients at his own practice, and he cites huge amounts of research and studies to back up his claims.  Most of us realize that American has become a very sick nation, with little being done in the way of preventative medicine, because doctors are taught to diagnose disease and prescribe a treatment. They are not trained in nutrition, and most base their advice (if any) about nutrition on misguided dietary principles.  One cartoon says it very well \\"The high-carb diet I put you on 20 years ago gave you diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease (and brain disease). Oops\\"<br /><br />The other reviews tell you what this book is about, how you should eliminate gluten and most carbs, and most fruits and sugar, get regular exercise, and sleep well, in order to have a healthy brain (and body). The writing style is very easy for anyone to understand the concepts and principles behind the plan.  There are recipes and of course lists of foods to help get you going on the plan. I literally could not put this book down once I started it. I have started the plan, and am extremely excited about it. I would love to give the book to everyone I know, and everyone I meet!
B008JFUO4U|2.0|What can I say. I like Tom Cruise & Morgan Freeman as actors. But this movie is really not something I expected to  see either of them in. This movie definitely left a lot to be desired. My opinion is, you have two wonderful actors and no story or chance for the actors to use their numerous skills.
B005LAII08|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater, loved it all over again when I watched it at home.  The music is amazing as well.
B00ABMZRVO|1.0|Poor story-line.  Poor acting.<br />Would not recommend this film to anyone.<br />Although, the using of the drugs seemed very real.

0802473156|5.0|This was an easy read, and well worthwhile. It opened my eyes to relationships. To give is to receive. But to give to your partner, you must find what makes them the happiest. I highly recommended this book to all my friends!
B004EPZ070|5.0|Great chic flick. Cute and enjoyable I have seen a few times and am glad to add it to my collection
B00BB8LTWI|5.0|I was pleased with the movie, the action was good and Daniel Craig is a good actor. I think it is a watch again movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a great movie; it wasn't far off from the book either! Actors were well chosen, characters well played.
B00AG297GK|3.0|What can you say about a movie that was OK? It had a few laughs but wasn't worth the hour and change it took out of my life.
B0031RS4V6|4.0|I guess you are talking the converted. Lee Child always seems to have a plot that keeps you reading even though you want to get a good nights rest !! The Hard Way was an intriguing story as I am expecting of Reacher &#34;&#34; every time . I enjoyed the book and would well recommend it to people you enjoy mystery and pace.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I thought this would be a great game to pass time, I was right!  Challenging and fun to play.  The only thing I wish I could change is when you get stuck on a puzzle I wish you could skip the one you're stuck on.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Great app,but it randomly stopped working.Don't know if it's a virus or not,  but unless mine works again,I advise you to not get it.
B005LAII4E|4.0|Lot of action, not the best movie out but then again not the worst. It is not a movie for my age group. (senior citizen). However I can see where some of the younger generation would like it .
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|A bit hard to determine next step sometimes but all in all very entertaining. Great story line too. Played smoothly. Graphics were not choppy at all.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|This is the 2nd time I am purchasing this CD. My first one was either lost or stolen. It's a must have if you are Buddy Guy fan or just love blues, period. On this CD, Mr. Guy sings covers of other artists songs and mixes it up with the likes of John Mayer, Tracy Chapman, Robert Randolph, Anthony Hamilton and Keith Richards. It's wonderful CD by a blues master having a good time with some of his friends or admirers.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very good game and quite addictive too but only after u understand the basics and get past the tutorial . Loads of fun v. . . . . . .
B0037XPP84|5.0|story and actors and quality of picture and coustum .....all the great...<br />kate's performing is great...very delicate and detail...she express the virgin queen's suffering
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A simple calculator that is easy to operate, plus it's free.  What's not to like!  I am sure you will like it too!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Excellent movie. You can look with your family.  It's a movie full of action and adventure.<br />The purchase of  was easy and fast.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|For the not even the aerobics instructor type, I 'm a beginner and think the plan presentation is awesome. Very well thought out presentation, well worth it and now the wife and I do this together, hard to keep up sometimes but getting there. You get out of it what you put in. Maybe could have put a 2-4 second pause between each exercise.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|I saw this concert on a public broadcast network, loved it and decided I wanted just the CD. I found the DVD/CD package offered on Amazon at a great price so I got both. The DVD stays in the house and CD stays in the car. It's for blues enthusiasts and Muddy Waters fans. It's fun to see young Mick Jagger and Keith Richards joining Mr. Waters and friends in a friendly blues session that just happened to be filmed and recorded for posterity.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Love love loved it  can't wait to read more by this author . Story line and characters were good kept me reading had to know what would happen .thanks
B0037XPP7U|3.0|flow rate of data not good..it needs to be remastered.story and actors and specially coustom are awesome.<br />i wish to get the director's cut with remaster....
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Love it...a great game to waste time..wish I didn't have to spend real money for aura..there should be other creative ways to earn it without buying...
B001DHXT2A|4.0|It is good to have as a set with the Avengers as well as the other superheroes in the group.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Addictive and fun without losing your hard earned money. Fast response to customer inquiries and instant player feedback. Amazing, awesome all on one screen.
B000008JUM|3.0|I purchased this compilation because I LOVED the Red Hot & Blue Jazz album. This CD could have been great, but it seemed like many of the artists simply phoned in their tracks. Cole Porter's songs deserved better.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This is a great game u should buy it it's not a waste of money but the controls suck but good game
B00C2IJJF0|3.0|only single disc...it's steel book...it should have more contents. but film itself is good though.<br />wrath of titan have it
B00A81MV3U|5.0|well written, well acted  comedy/drama about life, the problems it brings and the successes we discover.  Jennifer Lawerence won a well deserved Best Actress Oscar.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|My kids love this games. My teenager has a iPhone 4.S so she knows every emoji lol but anyways great app.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I wear these all day while at work.  The sound is phenomenal.  My only issue is the earpads were irritating my ears.  The replacement pads, findable on Amazon, make a much more comfortable experience. Because these were much cheaper than my next choice (Audio-Technica ATH-M50), I don't mind the extra $25 for comfortable earpads.
B002PYW26O|4.0|Just kidding! It was a fun adventure back into the cinematic world of the late-nineties when this cgi was cutting-edge. Even by today's standards, the visual effects are pleasing and the overall movie is upbeat and entertaining. There are times that the dialogue feels a bit rough but that doesn't stop it from being fun and engaging. Grab some popcorn and enjoy!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Good book but I had to tea  it for summer reading and if u watched the movie it's all the same the movies better
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|Good single player campaign and multi-player seems to be fixed. Bought this over a week ago without the ability to play online. Gameloft needs to take a page from MADFINGER Games, zero issues with Shadowgun: Dead Zone.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Gift for a fan - the fan loved the set wth UK version slightly different from US version! Signed Amazon shopper
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|We love the Minions!...This is a cool game for people of all ages. Sometimes a little tedious, but still hilarious, like the movies
B009NPA3Q4|3.0|I do like the artist, Phillip Phillips.  The album has a couple of very good songs.<br />Basically, I just don't see listening to the album over and over.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Quick read. Didn't disappoint. Great depth to the characters. Enjoyed the storyline.  I can't wait to read the next book.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Kept me busy. Great storyline. Could not put it down, be sure to utilize the hint button and the map in the note book, it will help you fine your next step.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We've watched the first two seasons in 1 week, I think that explains it all! Absolutely excellent show that must be watched!
B000VZIOCK|1.0|Worst album I have ever previewed. Thank God I did not buy the the silly thing. I think these idiots are deaf to good music. Would have given them a half star if possible. Do they actually think their reference to a song for the deaf is funny? Do not bother wasting your money on these idiots.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The best story I ever read by King, no exaggeration.  I literally did not want it to end.  Time travel stories are tricky, but he does so well with this by not attempting to explain overly much about exactly how it happened or why
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is my favorite game ever in the world !!! Play this game it rock`s you can build what ever you want !!!
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|The Game started trying to function in a mode where everything was placed \\"underground\\" and message \\"you do not have enough funds to place...\\" showed. I ran the test for compatibility and the game failed to pass. It literally placed the game in the earlier Windows XP Service Pack 2 mode. I ran the game in that mode and it worked better, but the \\"underground\\" problem resurfaces and I have to pull back to reflect distance. My Windows 7 is new, clean, and operating properly.<br /><br />Solution Found!!!<br />You must disable Aero. Aero is for the transparency setting on your background choices. Next you must change your screen resolution to match the highest resolution choice the game offers. Next set your computer to operate in Windows XP Service Pack 3. Your computer will kick and scream at you for doing this, but no harm done and the game will play fine. If you don't do all 3, your computer will run home to \\"mama\\" taking you to the background window repeatedly, and everything not recently saved will disappear.<br /><br />I enjoy this game and Zoo Tycoon. I believe that Windows 7 games are not as available as Windows 8 and maybe difficult to find in the future.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book!  Can't wait for more!  The setting the story line and the characters are like building a fire through the whole book
B001HN6922|5.0|Looks great in hi def, and my son loves it....he's already on the road to be a Disneyphile like his dad (:3
B0094BB4TW|1.0|keeps going to what i just looked at rather be on my ipod facebook app its crazy they do an update and it screws it all up and they dont fix it u like something it doesnt like updating status it never update this app is crap dont get it
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I enjoyed the cast of this movie.  I am also a old comic book fan, so I am a little bias to movies like this.  My favorite characters are Hulk and Iron man who where both portrayed wonderfully by the actors.  I would recommend it but I am sure everyone has seen this already at least twice.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|family move for the most part. the bad guy is kind of scary. But then again my son is 3...so I'm just being paranoid. He didn't seem upset when he saw the bad guy so i'm guessing he is ok. Otherwise great plot and graphics! maybe we enjoyed it so much becaue it reminded us of being kids playing video games again!
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|The time travel paradox is fairly common ground for writers and film makers but Stephen King brings his unique skills to it in this book. He allows plenty of time for the hero to become engrossed in his life in the past and makes the chance to change the past a long term commitment. I really enjoyed it as he also gave the reader plenty of time to ponder all the possible impacts of what was happening. Definitely recommended.
B006M9NJFG|2.0|Top leaks. The leak is very small but I was expecting a quality product for the price I paid!  I could've got 2 cheaper canteens for this price !!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Right out of the box, this product vastly improved my photography. I have lots to learn, but it was easy to get started.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I thought, at this price it can't be a bad deal.  It is better than I believed possible.  The first time in my life too good to be true was wrong, believe it
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|It is a fun game and rather addicting, just enough challenge that it's hard to leave alone.  I like that I'm always competing with myself, each round I want to beat the last one.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The author took a trite situation and put a new spin on it. Well done. I would recommend it. I downloaded it for free and got more value than what I paid. Would read this author again.
B00821PCJS|4.0|The special effects may be lacking but not enough to take away from the story. The charecters are very believable in that they act like every day (mostly) urban people who've been handed a rifle and had to fight an invading alien enemy AND survive in an apoctoliptic world.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is very addictive, excellent for being free.  Only down side is u need crystals to buy things not ur coin, u need to buy the crystals :(
B003PTP4S6|4.0|Yo-Yo Ma is the consummate artist, but I missed the human voice as God's perfect instrument in some of the selections, If you have heard Rigacci do Ecstasy Of Gold and Once Upon a Time in The West,  or Groban or Evanchoe do Cinema Paradisio (Se) than you know the point I am trying to make.  Still if you are a Morricone fan this should be in your collection.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this game it is awesome. the main thing that I dont like about it is that it can sometimes. take 4 ever to load.! that's it.
B008476HBM|5.0|I cannot say enough about how good Austen is at drawing you into her world. The characters are so fully fleshed out as to haunt you as real people. Read it, watch the movie, love it for the rest of your life. Seriously.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love Neil Gaiman, and The Ocean at the End of the Lane didn't disappoint. It almost reminded me of Neverwhere, my favorite Gaiman novel. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Gaiman's works, it is a quick read and a compelling story!
B000JCSPG0|5.0|This movie gave me rabies, but in a good way. Kurt Russell is russelling throughout the film and the Spaderman Is top notch for a test tube baby.
1419705849|5.0|Son enjoyed this particular book the best of all the books in the series. He enjoys the Wimpy Kid Series!
B0026IUXO2|5.0|If you like history and you like good acting, this is a good choice.  Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth takes her character from a teenager to becoming queen and transforming herself into a ruler.<br /><br />She's tough and sympathetic in her role and the photography is wonderful.<br /><br />I would recommend this highly.
B0081336FO|5.0|It is a great fusion between old and new. A must see for Holmes fans and those who like mysteries
B008M87GJK|5.0|Yes, it was a surprise as to how kool this app turned out.  Excellent in fact!  Up to date information.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I never saw the first one because it didn't get good reviews.  I don't think this movie did either but some new cast additions had me more interested in this installment.  Glad I didn't go with the critics!  It was very action packed, but not like the gory violence some people aren't a fan of.  And the cast was great.  I'd watch it again.
B005JABSB6|5.0|They are surprisingly comfortable to wear even over my regular glasses. I'm not sure if it was these glasses or my new Sharp TV but the 3D was much better than I had expected. Sometimes at the movie theater 3 D movies can be slightly out of focus but my experience was much better than i expected. The picture was astonishingly sharp and brilliant and exactly in focus!
6301066642|4.0|Yes glad I bought the movie, the movie arrived in good packaging, and in excellent shape. And being a VHS tape I was worried about picture color, well tape worked great. And seller did well in tranaction,<br />Thanks<br />Todd
1442359315|4.0|A little too much on the intellectual side but none the less something to think about. I got the audio
1451695195|5.0|Comforting after losing a loved one.  With the family gathered around my dying husband's bed, some swore they saw his soul leave his body and head toward a light.  Some sensed previously departed loved ones nearby. This book helps open one's mind to an afterlife..
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|I've been a Schwarzenegger movie fan for many years and was sad to see him head into politics...well, now I think he should've stayed there.  It was just an okay movie, a lot of mixed themes in this movie like action/thriller/comedy/romance/suspense.  Pick one and go with that theme.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Excellent brain game that starts simple and progressively gets tougher. It teaches one to think, which is a dieing art.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Have always loved to play Backgammon and can't get anyone to play with me.  Love being able to play without having to relying on another person!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is fun for PONY LOVERS of all ages. I enjoyed the mini games and creating my own Ponyville.
B001I403MM|5.0|Perspective altering, confirms for me what I haven't been comfortable discussing with others. I know of small children who have casually talked about their other lives, but didn't recall them as they grew older.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Not sure what I was expecting going into this movie, but I'm thinking because Tom Cruise is in it, it looked like another action movie of his it has to be good, right?  Not so much. Maybe it was just me but I didn't really &#34;get it&#34;.  It was just okay for me, couldn't wait for it to be over.
0767803434|4.0|Lots of action and frightening to think this could be possible........  Harrison Ford is such a good actor!  Special effects good too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|UK VERSION great can not wait for the next season. The cast is great and it was written very well
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|I love sci-fi/fantasy and it's cool to see new ideas coming out in cinema besides the typical sequels and remakes.  Although partially predictable the film was entertaining and enjoyable.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This movie is full of action.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat during the entire movie.  This is a must watch over and over.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|really enjoy playing. l love the fact that the regen limit increases and time gets shorter as you play more.
B000JVSUS4|4.0|I returned this item because an error on my part by ordering it in Blu-ray.  When I received the proper version I was happy with the movie.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|The subject says it all.  I bought this because of good reviews of the product. Would definitely buy again and recommend.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|There are few shows better than Firefly. I like to think that cancellation was a blessing. The show is such distilled brilliance and delight of characterization that 14 episodes is more than enough to love. A movie on top, tying a few loose ends, is the icing on the cake.<br /><br />The mystery is always more enduring than the solution. Experience the joy of Firefly and let it's mysteries thrill your imagination for years to come.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I had just finished reading the book by the same name. So I thought I would watch the movie.<br />It stays fairly true to the book- BUT- it doesn't include 20% of the book. So while it is fairly accurate, it is not very comprehensive.<br />There is SO much to the story and they skip so much my personal feeling was it didn't tell the story.
B002FHJ4B2|5.0|It's a John Hughes film, what else is there to say, classic scene, actors and plot.  It's why all of us children of the 80s love his films.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved these books have re-read them all twice Really wish they would write more the author really knew what to write at the right moment.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have played dozens of bingo games and love this one so much ...it keeps you wanting to keep playing.only bad thing hard to get big pay outs.otherwise it's great I give it a 5 stars..  keep up the good work....<br />.
0061148512|5.0|I was so excited to receive my book, I had been wanting to read it and own it for so long and with Amazon I was able to afford it. I will not be duped into trying Amazon Prime again as I was unaware after my free trial I would be automatically debited and am now struggling with the money I am out waiting for the return, but other than that HAPPY with this purchase.
159448385X|5.0|There are few books that you will be mentioning as your favorite for years to come; this is one of them.<br />The question remains- are you brave enough to read it, knowing that it will change you?
B007SSEZNA|4.0|and actually tuned into her true heart's desires. A reminder and inspiration to us all. I enjoyed the easy<br />and relaxed setting.
B007T7MIR0|4.0|It sure made my &#34;download&#34; easy to find.  Until my sister came to my rescue and told me to get this, I was panicked that I had spent $80 on a series and it was nowhere to be found.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|What a fabulous game. Not just bingo but slots too. So many different choices and chances to win everything you need for the game. Don't hesitate......get it NOW!!!!
B007L6VR12|5.0|I saw this movie once before and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. What a great movie and what a great price. I will not be duped into trying Amazon Prime again as I was unaware after my free trial I would be automatically debited and am now struggling with the money I am out waiting for the return, but other than that HAPPY with this purchase
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is really addicting and fun, it has amazing graphics and it is a great app to use to burn time and make your imagination run wild!! This game has made it hard for me to put down my Kindle!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I've been addicted to Mystery Manor for about a month now. I think I might end up liking this even more. If you like this one, check out Mystery Manor,and vice versa.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|So much fun! My grandchildren age 8-13 play it  all of the time as a group and keep score of who gets the doors open the most and how quickly. We all have super fun together!!!!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|amazing i really love all this apps they are really great i can watch my favorite videos and do a lot more fun stuff with them
B001AGXEAG|5.0|So excited to finally own this movie, I absolutely love it!!!! I will not be duped into trying Amazon Prime again as I was unaware after my free trial I would be automatically debited and am now struggling with the money I am out waiting for the return, but other than that HAPPY with this purchase
B008J05EL8|1.0|I haven't been able to open this font package.  I thought it was Microsoft Office but it isn't.  Sure with I'd read the other reviews before ordering this.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We thoroughly enjoy the acting, plots, and settings.  Downton Abbey is a highlight of the day for us and we enjoy looking forward to each new episode as well as discussing it afterward.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|As a longtime Trekkie, I say this movie really does the saga justice. Something for old fans and new. I can't go into the plot without giving it away.<br />BTW...This has already been released on ITunes because I downloaded it on Tuesday to my iPad.<br />Sorry Amazin, I couldn't wait!
B0096DZKZC|5.0|Sonic and Tails equals awesome. the evil Dr.Eggman has more robots and bosses.so Sonic and Tails are back to destroy Dr.Eggman again.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Thank you Amazon Prime and Sons of Anarchy - Men of Mayhem.  How can you go wrong with Peg Bundy and Hellboy
B009WMWWU8|4.0|I haven't used all of the features yet, but so far it seems great.  I tutor math and SAT prep for a living and need a calculator that will do so many things and this one is perfect.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Special effects are a must for me on action films. I thought the actors were well chosen and made a believeable movie.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|I enjoyed this novel. Another case where the storyline has enough ties in to current politics and events that you find yourself worried about just how close to the future some of this could be, especially the manipulation of government by corporations and the data risks of the individual. A good plot, lots of action, some stretches in technology. This was a page turner, and I ave already started on the sequel.
B007XF4J66|5.0|Casablanca is my all-time favorite film.  I have always been an avid movie fan since childhood (60 years) -- Casablanca has it all!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|One of the stupidest science finction movie of the centuary. Actor on rebound from his failed marriage. No story. A real Hollywood Con that features Big Star names and we pay $12 will become a norm in future.
B003LQ3YXU|2.0|I just do not see why this is so popular. I usually enjoy science fiction, but this one seems childish to me
B006BAEQB2|4.0|The book is good, but I question how much of a role these women actually played. Also, Gregory really overstates her point that the women were always used as pawns. I got it early on. Otherwise, a very good read about a woman hardly known, although how much is truth remains a question.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The point of view for this story alternates between Amy and her husband Nick, outlining the totally different perspectives that two people have even within their own relationship.<br />There are lots of twists and turns in the plot and even up until the very end, I didn't know how it would play out.<br />So good!
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|I cannot pull my wife away from the series.  I have therefore defined reality...and will watch all the episodes to date!
B000ID37SQ|5.0|some great one liners...I don't need him I don't need her I don't need nobody.....say goodbye to the bad guy...say hello to my little friend
0399255370|2.0|The story line is boring and the characters not memorable.  We gave it away after reading it only twice.  Very disappointed in this one.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Brilliant, soft, freeing, natural, holy and tender.<br />Only one who has experienced this can communicate it so wisely.<br />Bravo Jill!
6304712936|5.0|While I was teaching middle school, I showed this movie many times during our unit on Mozart.  The students loved it!  The acting is great, as is the music.  This is simply a film that belongs in any music-lover's library.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is amazing! It's like Walking Dead but with aliens. Every episode is suspenseful and makes you wanting more. It's absolutely addicting.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Not one, but 2 top notch albums in 1 package.  Buddy sounds as young and fresh as ever.  This one is great for old time Buddy fans or anyone listening to Buddy for the first time.  Awesome!
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|It tells a great story, has great performances, and even has some technical stuff thrown in. You won't be disappointed if you like rock or documentaries.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This game is quite addictive.  However having to pay for it in sequels can be expensive for someone who is on a limited budget as most seniors are.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|very cool but sort. I think the full version will have time. other than that you should get this game!! IT,S AWESOME!!!!
0872860175|5.0|Was looking for a replacement for a long, lost copy and this fit the bill. I like its simple graphics and portable size that allows you to take the essence of genius with you.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|Over the last couple of years, I have turned into a huge John Mayer fan for one particular reason...John can play the blues with incredible heart, soul and passion!!!  This DVD (and you can also get this on CD) showcases John's talent and demonstrates why he is so revered by even the greatest blues musicians around (like Clapton, BB King and Buddy Guy).  Although John's studio work is very good, his live performances best demonstrate his abilities.  This is one of the best DVD concerts you can buy....incredible!!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Another great book by Suzanne Collins. Only issue was that it seemed rushed in parts and things that happened didn't make sense like how Prim ended up in Capitol and died.  I can't wait for movie.
B00C5XBAOA|1.0|Only Sophia stands on her own. None of the other figures do. Only James, bends at the waist & is small enough to use the staircase on the Sophia Castle. If you are buying them, so that they can say &#34;phrases&#34; when using with the SOphia castle....DON'T. Only Sophia &#34;kinda&#34; works. The rest DO NOT!.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is very fun, but you really gotta be fast at it, I don't usually play games , but this was pretty fun.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona 4 (ps2) was released during my years in highschool but i waived it off as a childish, uninteresting game by the looks of it. Now, a few years later, i decided to give it a chance...<br /><br />After purchasing my Vita a couple of weeks ago, i had to find a game that would keep me occupied for a while. After hours of researching the litany of PSvita games (sarcasm), i stumble upon Persona 4 Golden. Even though it was highly praised (9/10, 9.5, Game of the Year, Best Vita game out), a few things turned me off. For example, the storyline in the description was completely over the top. High School students with powers jumping into and out of TVs to catch a serial murderer. It sounded a little childish to me. For whatever reason, i decided to give it a go. I have never been so wrong in my life. already spending about 50 hours into this game, it is safe to say that this is one of the best games ive played in a long time. Everything about it was wacky, and in a good way. I've laughed out loud so many times. The gameplay is addicting, the storyline is fresh, and art design fits perfectly, and the music is quite catchy. Nothing in the game ever felt like a chore.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY<br />This game is very unique. During the day, you go to school, work, hangout with friends, explore, read, study, go to basketball practice, etc, etc. It is very similar to the Sims games. There is even a dating simulation system in it.You can even undergo quests from random people, ranging from fetching rare items or talking to a girl for another guy who is too shy to. I actually like doing these quest because they are so interesting. After school, you and your buddies can meet up and enter the TV world where you fight \\"shadows\\". Combat is very addicting. (i hate grinding to level up, but this game is an exception). Many reviewers compare the combat of Persona to Pokemon. As the main character, you can carry multiple 'personas' which are like pokemon. There are multiple types, each witha different playstyle, and element. Imagine if in pokemon, the trainer fights instead of the pokemon and you 'summon' them to attack, buff, debuff or heal for you. You, as  the trainer, can attack as well and use items.It's just like Pokemon, if the roles were reversed. Because of this, you equip weapons, armor and other accessories to your character. Everything blends together too. Building relationships with other people strengthens your personas. Working earns you money to buy items and things like reading and studying, raises your stats.<br /><br />STORYLINE<br />The storyline WAS the reason why I didnt like this game at first. I thought it was too weird. But after playing through it, i fell in love with it. It's equivalent to a soap opera for women. I was engaged the whole time, wanting to know what happens next. The premise of the story is this; The students decide to test out a myth called the Midnight channel. At midnight (only if it is raining), your soulmate is suppose to show up on tv, and it works. The thing is, later on, you and your buddies find out that the people showing up on tv are dying.They are not the viewers soulmate but the next victim of a chain of recent murders. The weirdest thing is you find out you can enter the TV world to save these people, before it's too late. At this point, this game sounds INSANE, and it is! It is actually quite engaging and way better than i thought it's be. At timess, it can be moody and dark, and other times light-hearted and humorous. It matches the Light/Dark motif.<br /><br />GRAPHICS<br />A lot of people prefer realistic graphics instead of Persona's anime style, but i like the anime graphics, and I felt like it was perfectly suitable for this game. The graphics from the ps2 version have been polished and it looks amazing.<br /><br />MUSIC<br />JPop, anyone? The music was simply excellent, and im not even a fan of JPoP. I found myself humming the tunes at work, in the shower, etc.<br /><br />There are so many things to do in the game. This game is not an open world and it shouldnt be. (It's a small rural town) but you never run out of things to do. I've spent 50 hours on this game and there are so much to do still. and even after that, this game has a ton of replay value. As an RPG fan, this is ranked in the top 10 for me and is definitely a must buy. I can't stop praising and recommending this game. PERSONA 5, here we come!
B00CD4RPWM|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book,  was really looking forward to more Diana Gabaldon series, not into this one,
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|One of the best car chase scenes in recent movie history second only to Steve McQueen in Bullitt. The writing is tense and keeps you on the edge of you chair.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|I liked the format of the letters and notes, even once our heroine went to the island.<br />I never knew that Guernsey was occupied by the Germans during WW11 so that was an education for me. And I felt sad to know that the author didn't live to write and have more works published.
0765365278|4.0|I really got into this book right from the start. I love all of Sanderson's work and this one is no exception. I am looking forward to the rest of this series and would recommend this to anyone who was thinking about picking it up.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very easy and entertaining book to read. Almost couldn't put it down. Gave insight to what makes a great warrior.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun and different ! Really did keep my interest. I was always surprised at new levels. Never got easy.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is a story that rooted itself so deeply to the reader.  It takes you on a journey of every human emotion imaginable and beyond.  I recommend this story to everyone!  You never know what to expect next, I love that it is unpredictable in many ways!
B008VBYN80|1.0|Within five minutes of starting I ran out of energy and couldn't do anything until my energy came back in five minutes or until I spent loads of money on it don't waste your time getting this app
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Loved all the actors and directors interviews in what they did to prepare to become their character. After seeing these these segments, I truly feel Hugh Jackmann was robbed of the Best Actor Oscar.
0385751532|4.0|I saw the movie a long time ago and remember bawling at the end of it. Since I knew the ending, it wasn't  that shocking for me. It was still good, and thought the innocence of it coming from the point of view of a 9-year-old was different and intriguing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Reading this book will bring you nothing but heartache, but in a good way. You understand the being of humans and the meaning of love, and how you yourself are not looking for attention but the universe looking for your attention. I recommend this to open minded people who can handle diversity in such a book as The Fault In our Stars. Happy reading and keep a box of tissues close.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Kate Morton has a way of pulling the reader in.  You can't help but get attached to the characters and be transported into the story itself and experiencing it as if you were there.  She makes the characters and the places so real, love her writing style.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Super fun game! I have several bingo apps on my Kindle, and this is my favorite by far! My only pet peeve is that you have more advantages if your a Facebook member, which I am not and never will be. You can use your own money to purchase more credits, coins, etc but you do earn daily credits. I highly recommend this game!
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Disturbing that the hero Jack Reacher has so little regard for rules and the law and acts according to what he deems expedient and proper.  Is it wise to make any character so morally infallible as to make life and death judgments on his own?  Maybe fine reading for adults but Reacher is a poor role model when this novel is made into a movie.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I think this is the one that I bought brand new, so it was in perfect shape, and really good. As I watched it, it really brought back memories of the first time I saw it all. I absolutely loved every minute of it when I was in high school.
1594481717|3.0|The book came in a very timely manner, but I was slightly disappointed that there was a very noticeable tear on the cover. I don't really remember what condition I ordered the book in, but it was still a little disappointing. I expected normal wear marks, but it was just a little annoying.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|This story is not a new idea, it's a good casual read however and I enjoyed the lighter feel to it.  I would highly recommend it to younger readers.
B00C2IJJDM|5.0|Excellent, mint condition. Beautiful cover. This will be my 20th word after this exaggerated sentence has been skillfully concluded: Mars
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love, love, love this miniseries.<br />Excellent acting and beautiful scenes.<br />Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys British television.<br />Looking forward to the next season...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My favorite game ever ! Very fun and lots of rooms to play in. I play on my kindle fire as well as my home computer.
B00AH69BPM|4.0|Not bad, but Metallica has managed to still leave room for progression once again.<br />Hopefully, they can make a better sounding cd with more precise arrangements on the next one.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. Play game everyday. Addictive and fun. I haven't had a problem with the game. I have fun with this game
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I'm a big uno fan and I absolutely love this game the graphics are fun the only thing I would change is you can't play stack uno that would make it a lot better.
B009CG9CXO|5.0|Jaws is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I'm not sure why I didn't watch this one with deleted scenes sooner.  Some parts are funny and some are more gruesome so beware.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The end... I can say no more without spoiling it, but so close to 5 stars. Wish it hadn't ended like that
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Man oh man, I grew up with these, in a galaxy far, far away. the blu ray versions are sweet and I even managed to get my wife to watch the complete saga (ok, ok, still got two more for her to watch). I will keep these gems in a safe place :)
B007REV4YI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and it's part of my &#34;Daniel Craig as Bond&#34; collection.  It was not as good as the build up I had received, but still it was a good &#34;Bond movie.&#34;
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Into darkness, was absolutely amazing....a must see film for trekies and non trekies alike. And the cinimaphotography was breathe taking.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The 3rd & final book was as good as the first. I couldn't put this book down. Not only because I wanted to know how the series ended, but because it was just a real page turner in itself. Katniss really found herself in this one, and I found myself feeling proud of her as if she's a real person. It really draws you in.
0345803485|5.0|This book makes me want to read it all night long. Hot sexy storyline. Love can be shown in many ways and tested at every turn. But true love will conquer all. This book will make you believe it. I can't wait to read book II.
B004A3KPYY|4.0|A classic with a lot of childhood (teens) memories. True, the technology he used in the beginning sounds a little old but it still sounds great. Jean Michel surely broke some grounds with his music and I still remember my old, huge headphones I had as a child, relaxed on the sofa on full blast, taking me other places, almost magic.
B008X9Z3UC|3.0|Good price.  Well padded.  I really wanted this to be the perfect case, but I was disappointed to discover that there is no protection for the edge of the Kindle Fire HD 7\\" from the zipper.  When zipped, the zipper comes in direct contact with the device, there is no padding or protection around the inside where the zipper closes.  It is like they sacrificed padding for the tight, glove like fit.  Very disappointing since the purpose of a case is to protect the device from scratches and damage during transport.  How can I trust this case to protect my new best friend when I clumsily drop it? I can't, so I probably won't use it. Plus, there is no slip pocket or any room for any accessories.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game was fun and entertaining and it always gave something to do. I would recommend this to anyone sceptical about the game. It has all my favorite characters and more.
0345803507|5.0|This book is HOT! I LOVE this plot and storyline. The characters are well written and this finally book has lots of sex with a purpose and the meaning of love. I can't wait for the next E.L. James book.
B008K9UZY4|1.0|I have played Sonic in the past on my playstation and I was a wee bit nostalgic so I downloaded this. Ehum, not work my time as the graphics is beyond poor and the controls... Well, I won't go there. Needless to say, I deleted it from my android and that's that.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Best collabo movie yet. Well written, characters are great and interesting!  Still start from beginning and watch as if I never seen it before.
0345529057|5.0|Excellent purchase can not put the books down, have been losing sleep due to the books but I do not mind at all.
0345803493|5.0|Love scenes are surreal and HOT! If you love reading SEXY books than this series is for you. Well written and fast moving. I read it in 2 days. I am waiting for book three with baited breath.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Well written and kept my interest from the beginning. I enjoyed the various interviews that were scattered throughout the book. Was a little difficult remember the characters at the end. It starts with their interviews, jumps around in between and then ends with them. Would have been easier if I had the actual book to flip back through vs. reading on my iPad.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|I was thoroughly entertained throughout. It was well paced thought provoking, had a great cast, and a twist ending. Great movie!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game was fun while it lasted. Went through it all  in one night.  Hope they come up with more
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I'm a left-hander, and this watch is great. Very classy looking. I don't care for the band; may swap it out.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Sweet and easy read. Great for dog owners. Funny perspective from a dogs point of view. A real tear jerker.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very simple but can pull you into using up your day very quick. Don't play it at work haha
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Must have . So twisted an  it really keeps you wanting more . Filling in the word requirements are stupid
B005P4PAVK|5.0|This show is a smash hit for a good reason...it's the funniest comedy to have been shown in quite some time.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I absolutely loved the whole series. Slammed through all of them and now it all kind of blurs together! I couldn't put it down. Read the first one and listened to the others on audio. Violently detailed, so if you get squeamish easily, might want to skip. Thought the American movie version did it justice. Excited for the other to be made!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a time passer that is all and it is faster to clean up them a real deck of cards.
B001QKB6OM|5.0|Beautifully shot -- this film is a wonderful encapsulation of jazz & the jazz scene in the late 1950s. Highly recommended.
0142410705|4.0|I really really love the vlogbrothers channel on youtube, everything John and Hank Green do on the tubes is gold in my book. Their contribution to the mental_floss channel has made it something great and Hank's retelling of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is fun and witty. With my love for the everything they do on youtube I thought is necessary to finally read some of John Green's books. First one I picked up at my local bookstore, Secret Garden Books in Seattle, WA (which is an amazing place), was An Abundance of Katherines.<br /><br />AAOK, as I will call it because I think the book and I are on these terms now... Is technically a teen novel. WAIT. Don't run away kicking and screaming. Green is known for writing books not \\"for teens\\" but with teen lives and teen readers in mind. This book made this abundantly clear. Terms were not dumbed down, words were long and intelligently used, and there were footnotes! FOOTNOTES. Gosh, I am such a nerd for footnotes, some of my favorite books have footnotes. Green how did you know just how to hook me in?<br /><br />AAOK's plot revolves around a boy named Colin, your not so typical teen prodigy. Colin was born with the ability to memorize things with greater ease then most and this has always made him an outcast, different. Colin also has an obsession, with girls named Katherine, he has only dated Katherines. Okay, well he did sort of date another girl not named Katherine but that didn't last long; a day. After a terrible break up with his Katherine XIX he is beside himself. His best friend and my favorite character in the book, Hassan, convinces him all his ills will be healed by a road trip. After awhile on the road they stop at the alleged resting place of the body of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. This grave is in a small town in Tennessee, the girl leading the tour becomes a sort of guide through Colin's recovery. In order to understand what has happened with his exes Colin begins to develop an equation to map relationships. Hilarityand drama ensues during Colin and Hassan's respite in Tennessee, learning more about themselves and others.<br /><br />Green writes an intelligent and well rounded book for the most part. It hits a lot of the right highs to keep a writer interested. My only major problem in it lies in his writing of his tertiary characters. They seems shallow and unnerving, which may just be from the writing being from the perspective of Colin, he finds a lot of \\"normal\\" people shallow. There are some things that seem like they could have used a little more foreshadowing as well. The learning curve that Colin faces on relationships is extremely relatable and makes his character lovable in an odd way. The use of the aforementioned footnotes really intensifies the story and draws you deeper into it. In the end the development of Colin's equation is also explained which will be interesting to all you math nerds. I couldn't follow it, but I wasn't very good at math in High School... Regardless of this fact I find AAOK an great read for someone that wants to stray away from Sci-Fi and Fantasy for awhile, like I did at the time.<br /><br />Read more of my reviews at [...]
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Got into these after watching the first season on HBO. I absolutely loved the whole series. Slammed through all of them and now it all kind of blurs together! I couldn't put it down. Of course now I watch the series comparing the two. While they don't follow it page by page, they're doing a fairly good job of telling the story. Was a little difficult at first keeping all of the characters straight. HBO did a nice family tree you can find here: [...]<br /><br />Extremely helpful when reading on a device vs. the book. It doesn't just show the family connection, but also those who are affiliate with that particular family.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I was gad that I was able to download an app onto my kindle fire from eBay. it just makes things easier.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Love it but keep having to go. Back to Plano because I keep running out of power ups and keys sad because otherwise it would be my favorite bingo game
B004CFAWK2|5.0|This book was required reading for my English class, but I loved it. I've seen the movie so I thought it'd be good, but it was even better than I expected. The drama kept me reading all night. I'd definitely read it again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Shouldn’t expect an intellectual thought proving read. Smutty, but entertaining. Easy read, so you’re not investing too much time. I enjoyed the series.
B00933JL0A|5.0|Enjoyed the game when wanting to kill time before my next class. It passed the time that I needed to pass.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Just an FYI, if anyone who reads this book is interested in dabbling in BDSM please understand this woman knows NOTHING about it. Her writing is not a good example of it at all. She clearly didn't do her research with anyone who's actually in the lifestyle because this book reads like what she THINKS BDSM is. If you are interested go pick up some actual non-fictional material about it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I laughed! My son loved it! I wasn't expecting much from it but it turned out to be a really fun one.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Great movie to begin with.<br />Ordered for my psych class assignments. Best way to order movies through amazon.com<br />Highly recommended movie!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|My brother in law turned me on to this game and it was an instant hook. Not because I want to destroy the world but it is a good game to pass the time in a car ride or waiting for your wife to get done in the girly stores at the mall
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You are hooked from the beginning...LOVE IT!  Watched all 3 seasons in 2 weeks!  Can't wait for season 4 to start.
B009PJ1Q82|4.0|This is a very well done portrayal of the degradation of a person who has taken to very heavy drugs and it's effects on those around him. It is also a record of loyalty and love of one person to the other until even that is stretched beyond its limits, through the endless programs of detoxification. 'Smack' will never let go of an addict--it seems to go to molecular level and can't be gotten out.<br />The story was well told by the actors, particularly by Thure Lindhardt and Zachary Booth. The final scenes were, as they should be,<br />an ending as it had to be, Erik finally realising that he could do no more. In fact, he had well and truly found that Paul wasn't the person he loved at all. Paul had been a stranger for some time--Erik's friends had tried to tell him--and as we all know, love makes one want to overcome all difficulties, and it takes a very strong person to finally admit he has failed. But at least he had tried for 9 years. At the end I was, hoping that Erik would find find someone else. I wonder if he did? I liked this film for its honesty.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved every part of this book. The movie really messed up a lot of parts. Ready to start the second one.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I went to see the new iron Man 3 and loved it. this game was a fun one to pass the time with.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Discovered it by accident and have been amazed with how well it works! I have it on 3 android devices and have recommended it to half dozen more people who use it. You can't go wrong with this product!
B000LCAI54|5.0|I got this book because of the tale of a small boy who befriends  a  lost Siamese show cat.  I remembered it and the pictures from reading this Reader's Digest book years ago. It made that much of an impression on me.  It is such a sweet sad story with a hopeful ending
B00A03WBVI|5.0|I love One Direction now. All my friends sucked me into the hole that screamed\\"I love 1D!\\" My favorite songs on this album  would be  Live While We're Young,Kiss You,C'mon C'mon,First Last Kiss,Rock Me,Over Again ,and They Don't Know About Us.They're really funny people and seem like a people who I'd love to hang out with.This is a really good soundtrack.Their music isn't all the same.It's different on each track,up beat,and SUPER catchy
B00979OL5A|4.0|It was a bit short because I did not want to pay for the extra levels in the game .
B008RA3X5E|1.0|This was a great app until it started to shut down 3 days ago. Now with the time going, it will skip anywhere between 3 and 5 seconds. Then It says it has an error and can't continue to run. Since I was using this as my primary alarm clock and paid for the app, I was expecting a problem.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I have really enjoyed this game and have played frequently BUT the newer rooms have non tradable items. Such as the Elvis bingo room. I have used over 5000 chips to try and get the \\"dune buggy\\" which is a non tradable item. as a result of this i may quit all together. I play 5 diff accounts.<br />This is a good way to run customers off. And i think i will be one of them.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The first 30 pages felt a little slow but there was definitely enough to keep the pages turning. I'm excited to see how the silo 18 handles the new mayor's discoveries.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but yet easy enough to do. I wish there were more rooms tho. I did have to look up some of the things....just could not figure some of the clues out without help.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Downloaded this to my Kindle and can't get to anything anymore. It just stays on the homepage no matter what I do.  Don't download this app.
B0061QD82E|5.0|I looked everyone in stores to find Lady and the Tramp for my daughter.  She feel in love with the book and I read it to her almost every night for a month before she wanted me to read anything else.  :-)  Amazon always has fair prices and great quality products.  I buy with Amazon every month!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is the best game for when your board it is very funny me and my sister summer and Madison play this game a lot it's so fun
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Everything was packaged nicely, not dents, no bent corners. There was no tracking information, which initially worried me because I needed it in under a week, but it showed up two days after I ordered it, I was SO pleased.
0811879542|5.0|I saw a friend reading this book to her child and I just had to buy it for my grandson.  It's a fun, entertaining book.  A must purchase for any young child.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Helter skelter pace with more turns than LeMans at Monaco.  Worth the ride even if one is short of breath.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I liked all 3 of the Matrix movies.  The first was the best.  2 and 4 got weaker but finished the story line.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the first time I've ever reviewed an app, but this one is outstanding. I can write a shopping list on my Kindle, it syncs to my phone and I can check off each item as I shop. I can easily jot down things I want to remember later without losing the scrap of paper. It makes keeping a journal fun and secure. Nicely done.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Enjoyed this movie from start to end. The ending was the best. Had it all.. humor action and of course romance.
0345803507|5.0|Although bought used, this book looked brand new when I opened the package.  I couldn't have asked for more.  Awesome!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This was such a heartfelt book. As a cat lover, I found Bob to be a typical cat who is a friend for life and at times seems almost human.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I love this cheesy movie!  Great actors singing 80's music.. I think Tom Cruise did a great job!  Loved Russell Brand too.
0425252868|5.0|...Let me first add that I am very fond of reading war stories. I started first with Vietnam, then a few on WWII, and when I read my first Civil War book, that created an unquenchable thirst for the past 21 months...everything and anything I can get my hands on.  This book piqued my interest because of my life-long love of the B-17 Flying Fortress.  The TV show \\"12'0 Clock High\\" was a must-see every week when it first appeared back in '64 when I was 9 years old.  I believe that is where and when my interest in our wars began.  I found this book to be emotional and hard to put down.  I found it very interesting in how Franz and other pilots despised the Nazi's and the Gestapo.  Their Christianity was also somewhat of a shock, as I had always been led to believe otherwise.  I enjoyed how Adam wrote the two seperate stories, and how he brought it all together by the end of the book.  Just a great read in my opinion, and despite the atrocities and bloodshed that wars bring upon mankind, this book describes how an warrior (fighter pilot), with the capability to \\"do his job\\", marveled at the skill of his opponent to fly an annihilated bomber back to his home base.  One doesn't see much compassion against his enemy during war, and how Franz<br />\\"helped\\" his enemy escape was, and is, just a truly amazing story...
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I love this show, all the people I know love this show.  If you are reading this, stop doing so and go watch this show.
0515153656|3.0|I find myself of mixed opinion about the book.  The plot pulls you in, and I read it in a single sitting.  But, the technical inaccuracies are glaring, especially concerning weapons, how they are used, and their effects.  ***Spoiler Alert***  For instance, in the final climatic scene, Child goes into great clinical detail about the effects and shot spread of an Ithaca shotgun, and the special shot, the hero Jack Reacher would have to make to prevent innocents from being harmed.  Basically the entire several paragraph description was almost entirely BS with Child describing anyone in the shot cone as being decapitated, and the shot cone being impossibly huge.  These errors detracted severely from the storyline.  All that being said, I liked the book, and got the second one as well.  We'll see if the author does his research a little better next time.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|We all love this Muppets movie.  The songs in the movie are awesome and catchy too.  Life's a Happy Song and man or Muppet are so funny you will find yourself singing them.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Inevitably, I have to compare this to the LotR movies, and I think The Hobbit is much better than any of them.  Characters were more relate-able.  Better special effects, too, which was a major turnoff for me in the LotR movies.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I plan to read this again very soon, and I seldom re-read books.  I look forward to reading Jojo Moyes' other books to see if they are as good.
0515142247|2.0|Just finished the 2nd Jack Reacher Book.  The style of writing pulls you along at a quick pace, but the plot in this Jack Reacher story is much weaker than Killing Fields.  This book continued the same technical issues that a decent researcher would have fixed.  You can spot right away when Child is pulling something out of his butt.  The more extended detail he provides, the more likely the information is to be wrong.  One example is the extended discussion about the Glock 17 vs the Beretta 92F early in the story.  He gets all the \\"facts\\" almost completely wrong.  The Glock was never evaluated by the US, they refused to meet some of the absurd requirements, especially since the Glock was in widespread military use already in Europe.  The Glock 17 was not named for its 17 round capacity, but for being the 17th technical design by Glock.  Errors of this kind continue throughout the story.  These are not \\"artistic license\\" kind of errors; they are the mark of poor research.<br /><br />I may read some of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, because reportedly later books are better, but I would not recommend this book because of the weak plot and poor research.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I love this thing, more like my son loves this a lot he is always holding it and everything.  we do not regret getting this that's for sure id recommend this to everyone.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I bought this package for my son't birthday.  He was moved to tears and said it was the nicest gift he had ever received.  He looks forward to many hours of viewing the serics from start to finish.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Wish it had Prometheus in there but you can't win em all. The Blu Ray transfer on all these is perfect. Its a great compliment to the series.
0307887448|5.0|I now have dystopia myopia because of it.<br /><br />Great escape - fun in the sun.<br /><br />Highly recommend and not to be skipped.
0761172726|5.0|I have been using Mom's Family Calendar for years. I began the year before my youngest son left on an LDS Church Mission. It was nice to be able to add, or omit, activities for members of the family, by the changes month to month. I color code activities still, for dad, for adult daughter at home, and I even keep track of South Korean holidays in the column saved for my youngest. it is so nice to be able to glance from across the room to a particular column and immediately see there may be a conflicting activity.  I love the stickers you can add as well. I decorate up each family member's birthday, both children and grandchildren, with the stickers and they are wonderful. I first got this at a discount store, and was so disappointed when they no longer carried it. Amazon made it possible for me to keep up! Love it!
B008GJV8BW|2.0|I expected more from a Cohen brothers' film.  Oh well, every film can't be good/great one...... and this is an oldie.  I will always be a fan of the Cohen bros.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This movie in the Avengers saga is one of the best. The casting was put together very well, and the characters and script are relatable and believable. Great movie.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Mayer's sixth studio effort is a lot of things: fun, somber, introspective, romantic, optimistic, clever. Perhaps most importantly, it's enjoyable. This album contains considerably less harmonica and considerably more electric guitar yet stays true to the country/rootsy sound John established with last year's Born and Raised. After multiple listens, the album cover art becomes ever so true and appropriate. These songs evoke visions of western grandeur.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The melodies are superb, complemented nicely by Mayer's tasteful and effective guitar playing. The vocal lines are excellent, a bit of a surprise considering Mayer's throat surgery. I feel like each track paints a picture, and by the end you have a beautiful mosaic of what John's been through over the past few years. Who You Love is by far one of the high points, although it will undoubtedly cause some to roll their eyes. Katy Perry's contribution proves valuable and effective. There really is not a \\"bad\\" track on the whole album.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Some of the songs seemed like they ended far too early or too abruptly. The solo at the end of Call Me the Breeze was just starting to take off, and then John pulls the plug. I would've liked to hear that one go longer. That being said, it's still an excellent track and fits perfectly into the PV tapestry. The end of Who You Love is the low point of an otherwise outstanding track. The second \\"Wildfire\\" featuring Frank Ocean is beautiful yet puzzling at the same time. I'm not sure what purpose it serves, and it really kind of kills the flow of the album. This is another song that could have benefited from a longer running time. You're No One 'Til Someone Lets You Down is a bit too honky-tonk for me. It just seems too kitschy, which is too bad because it really is a well written song.<br /><br />As a fan of John Mayer, I highly recommend this album. As a fan of great music that makes you 'feel' something, you will not want to pass up Paradise Valley.At a short 40 minutes, you have very little to lose. Take it on with \\"big ol' empty arms.\\"<br /><br />Standout Tracks:<br />Wildfire, Waitin' On the Day, Who You Love, Badge and Gun
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son loves it and so do I! The minions are so cute! They are irresistible not to have this game.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This book was not as good as the first thee. I felt that the author was just trying to finish the series.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|It's quite nice, actually, to have a full score of all Zimmer's work on one movie within one soundtrack. He has excellently placed the music in line with the plot, leaving a fantastic soundtrack that is very awesome to listen to.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Sad that a section is over but know Downton Abby will continue with the excitement of the last three seasons. I'm hooked
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is probably the best gun type app I have ever downloaded it is authentic it is just like the real thing minus the the feel but it seems all good.
B00942Y0TM|5.0|My daughter loves this movie, she could watch it everyday if I let her and I love watching it with her I never get sick of watching it. Highly recommend it!
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|The only thing I do not like is that you can not earn more coins each coin is worth 2 why would I buy more coins when I can not earn more that makes no sense 2 me
B000FC2PKG|4.0|Was not familiar with Lisa  Gardner but  was hooked by your &#34;Look  Inside.&#34;  Kind  of a family whodunit.  Maybe, just maybe, a little heavy on  the romance but this was, in my opinion, a great crime solver and love story combined.  Most  enjoyable. I'll read  more of  her  works in the future, for sure.
B00821OX98|4.0|The characters are dynamic and engaging. Some of the science and tactics are a little off, but I'm not watching this for realism.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that I have the audio to go along with the written word....my only problem is that I cannot find a 'pause' button anywhere, which is a little inconvenient.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Talent to die for, music be it show tunes, rap or the oldies, phenomenal.  Mash ups incredible and dance moves that make me want to get up and bust some moves.  Love this show about underdogs that have great talent and heart.
B000FCK65W|5.0|The author brings living in the time of immigrants and poverty in the early 1900's to life. Her attention to detail of time and place provides the reader to experience life thru the eyes of her characters. There is a simplicity and charm in her writing. Humor is injected through the name calling of the children's games when the heaviness of the grimness of her life sets in. There is also a suttle type humor in the prejudices of one of her characters for all ethnic groups even and especially Russians of whom he knows none.  I had read this book as a young women and thought it rather slow as an older women I understand and appreciate it so much more than I did then.Great Book!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book. Two lives, a young Molly, a 91 year old Vivian, tell their stories of struggle, hardship and loss. Beautifully written, we are along for the journey when finally it all comes together in a happy ending.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Here we go again. Spend millions of dollars to make a movie to arouse the primal feelings that reside deep in the human species. If you love killing humans and like to see it then this gem is for you. Two thousand years since the barbaric gladiators of ancient Rome and this movie manages to bring back that lust to shred fellow humans apart. I would have hoped that my species has advanced beyond this for entertainment.
1574214276|4.0|Purchased this book for my son after he learned Zentangle in school.  He loved recreating the examples and expanding on them to create his own original designs.
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|Hoping for a generic Arnold action movie. Got a movie with too little Arnold, plot-holes you could drive a semi-truck through and a wtf ending moment.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Simply the best from Britain, much better than most of the &#34;very&#34; low IQ programming of most US TV programming.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It's a demo, not much can be done on a demo, but my nephews still enjoyed playing it. Fun for them
B0055OMBIU|5.0|I've purchased 3 of these Cityscape puzzles for my grandchildren and two for friends. They are wonderful educational toys and so much fun that the whole family gets involved -- kids of all ages, parents and grandparents.  You won't be sorry you bought one.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Really good movie, the acting was great especially Emma Watson. Loved the story line, how two people with similar backgrounds dealt with their problems in different ways.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I ve had pro version for a long time. I use it now more than ever. Found a lot of commercial free music, better than Pandora. Plus my favorite podcast. Version 8.0 is solid, had no problem and works like a charm.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|The boys had fun with it, but it didn't grab their attention. They played with it for a couple mins and moved on.
0345529057|5.0|I loved it!  Can't wait for book #5 coming in October!  I would recommend anyone who is caught up in the HBO series to read these books.  It goes into so much more detail and explains why and how certain things happen.  Cudos to George R.R. Martin.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I am not a big Tom Cruise fan, but this one is REALLY GOOD.  Reminds me a little of Shooter - that vigilante justice.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|A classic!  Never gets old!  Great movie for adults and kids alike.  Family time just got easier :)  Goonies rules!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Per my 9 year old nephew, he did not like this game at all. He said it was too boring.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love the show! It is very entertaining The cast, the script are incredible. Catching up on season 2 to be able to watch season 3 live.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I loved this book. I particularly like the phasing in and out of the WW2 scenes with the modern scenes; which I think was well done. How the Norwegians treated their people who fought for the Nazis was new to me. In this book Harry seemed to start showing more maturity. Be sure to start with the Bat. You have to read these books in chronological order to keep track of the women dropping in and out of Harry's life, and to see him mature.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Had good potential but kept falling asleep. The movie needs a boost and as they always say the sequel is never as good as the original now I know why.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Boys liked it for a while... but the nephews moved on after about thirty minutes or so. Had more fun with other games.
0307655105|5.0|This is a wonderful book for little listeners and learners.  The book came in excellent condition to replace a very well used book we have had over 6 other children and grandchildren.  Hours of looking and learning with this book.  Never disappointed.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Was a five star weather app, my favorite. But apparently fixing what ain't broke is the in thing. Can't see any way this makes it a better app
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I am not a Tom Cruise fan but he is outstanding in this movie. Very good story line and something new for Hollywood. Tom Cruise's Scientology joke of an issue withstanding I would recommend this movie.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|My nephew didn't like this game so much. It really didn't keep his attention like some of the other games have.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Overall, Mr. Aslan provides a general over view of Jesus and those of his disciples.  From a personal perspective I found the chronicling interesting and insightful.  Kudos to Dr. Aslan for providing as thorough a narrative as humanly possible.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series and was very excited that this was available on Amazon Prime (Netflix only had Season 1).
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|You go through coins fast,  and don't get them back.  It is a rip off,  and I deleted it from my kindle.
B004PIU8LE|1.0|I bought this for my husband who loves Pink Floyd, but it broke within the first day.  It was hardly used and it fell apart!
1439107955|5.0|Although the idea of reading about cancer would seem depressing, I found the book fascinating.  Dr.Mukherjee is a beautiful writer. If oncology does not work out for him, a writing career is certainly another valid choice.
0786962984|2.0|I had heard great things about this game and purchased to play with my 9 and 7 year old sons. Previously we have played Talisman together and we love that (minus the long games). Had hopes this would be a nice quick game to play with them. Just find it dull, not enough variance in game play.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I have always liked Nora Roberts.  Kept my interest until the end.  Great story.  Highly recommend this book to anyone.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I wish I could get a refund for my purchase. I have a fairly high speed internet connection and have no problems streaming high-def music and videos from other websites, but the quality for this rental was atrocious.<br /><br />From the very beginning of the piracy warnings before the movie even started, the poor quality of the stream rendered the viewing experience impossible. I tried resetting my connection and rebooting my computer to no avail. The video was extremely low-quality even when I wasn't viewing on fullscreen, not that it should matter.<br /><br />I wish I could get a refund for my purchase. This low quality video was not worth $1, much less the $5 I paid for it.
1465001107|4.0|I can see him every month now!!! Yayy!! I don't the set up of this calendar as i did for the 2012 BAD calendar ! But i dont care much because it's MJ
B005N09L5C|5.0|Good Book. Good Movie. Surprising good in HD quality. Not pixelated at all. The movie is very eye opening and should be watched.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|While this book missed the effect of co-parenting on the spouse's career, it was spot on for many other important points rarely discussed in most circles.  I intend to give this book to all female grads.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khaled Hosseini is just a really good writer.  He always had good plots, uses historical realities, and creates interesting characters.<br /><br />I have to say the his first two books were more interesting to me, but this one was very good as well.
B00AEBB86A|5.0|This movie keeps you glued to your seat wondering what the next step will be.  Some of the acting leaves a little to be desired but good entertainment overall.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|This mic is great. It gets heavy use in a musical summer camp and this mic is a trooper. One of our more complicated students took the mic cord with the mic attached and flung it around like a lasso and hit the mic into a wall. Still works none the wiser! Good sound, no extra reverb from the mic alone and the kids love the look and feel of the mic.
B000002H97|4.0|I found nothing wrong with the album itself, (Love the Music) and it arrived fast!  But it was shipped in a box with out packing material and the box was half crushed when it arrived. The disk was fine but the plastic case was broken.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Nuff said. It is intuitive and syncs with every device I have. Love it, love it, love it, love it.
B00000JXVK|5.0|This is a classic movie I watched when I was a kid.  Shows some of the premier riders of the day that brought motorcycling to where it is today.
B00D3V8PSC|4.0|I like this new CD. I'm sorry Bill Ward didn't make it as the drummer but Rage Against the Machine's drummer Brad Wilk does a bang-up job filling that position. What keeps me from giving this a 5-star rating is that, in all the 7 minute + songs (and there are 5 of them!) there's not a lot of adventurous instrumental meanderings like there were on their first self-titled album and &#34;Paranoid&#34;. But that's not a huge gripe. I still really enjoy this new release. I got it as MP3 and the sound quality is phenomenal. One suggestion, and this actually makes me want to nudge in another half-star, is to get the longer version with the 3 extra songs as, personally, I find them to be amongst my favorites - especially &#34;Pariah&#34;. If you're a fan of Black Sabbath's Ozzy days, I'd get this recording. And it doesn't hurt that Rick Rubin produced it. He's one producer I buy CDs just for the fact that he's worked on them.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this author. SO GOOD! I've devoured the first 2 books in the trilogy within a span of three days. I can't wait for the last one... I hope projections are right and it will come out in 2014, I want to know how it ends!
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|Not intuitive at all. Can't figure it out. Clunky and I just didn't like it ... i just didn't like it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Well the title explains it, the game has tons of different challenges. it is very addictive and I love that it is free :D
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As always Ken Follett is masterful.  I could not put this book down.  I became involved with the characters and almost felt as if I knew them.  A great novel. Now waiting for the 3rd. book.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Angry birds is sort of a mindless addiction. The addition of Star Wars themes has made this game much more satisfying for me. I would definintely recommend this to angry birds players.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|It took me some time to understand how to play the Uno on my Kindle, but I do like it.  Now I can play it by myself.  I wish I could figure out how to play against my roommate who has his own Kindle.  So far, we have not figured out how to get to play each other, Kindle vs. Kindle, but not using Facebook.  I don't like to play games on Facebook, because then too many people want me to play all kinds of silly games on Facebook and I'm not interested in doing that at all.
B00AEFYJZ8|5.0|All time favorite. love this movie. It touches many lives in real life, when in love you will defend that love.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|This is a visually pleasant movie that takes you back to an era of elegance and self indulgence for many.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. An excellent story line, easy to read yet interesting writing style. A wonderful book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Therefore, it is inherently thought provoking, heart touch, funny, and so many other words/phrase that describe this story of awesomeness<br /><br />Thank you,<br />A Nerdfighter
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I previously had a Nook and the Kindle is so much better in so many ways. However, the only negative thing I can say is that you can't play Candy Crush or other King games on the Kindle. Please fix this and I will give a 5.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Not a reader of books that I should have read as a teenager. It was very enjoyable even as 72+ year old.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|it's a nice movie that'll give hope to those who really need it, the characters in the movie are well played
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|If you are in IT, you should read this book - you will recognize some of the characters (and possibly all of the events).
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Took me 3 days to figure out how to post.  It still works inconsistently.  Also, on some posts, it does not allow you to \\"Like.\\"  Wish it would allow you to sign out.  I don't feel secure with my Facebook account open at all times.  Even when I'm signed out of Facebook on my laptop, I'm still logged in on my phone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Good calculator. Easy to use. Looks good on the kindle. Fulfilled all my daily needs.<br />I can highly recommend this one.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|The story is about a the 2 boys and very simple yet very captivating.  You might not want to leave your seat until the movie is over.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|An excellent game just love playing it<br /><br />I love this game especially playing it on my kindle good fun and the chat can sometimes be a good laugh, building up your won items can be a bit slow as i only get judt over 100 credits per day. But give it a go and dont forget to add me.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a game for all ages, it keeps me busy and entertained on the train, and even my mom loves it.  I've not tried the multi-player version, hopefully I'll enjoy that as well. Best of all it is free which makes it even better.
055358202X|5.0|I also bought this as a used book...seller noted some folded pages, but the pages that were folded were in the beginning description pages and did not occur in the book.  It was as good as new ...
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Good game.  Was held spellbound until the end. Dying for part two to be purchased.  Will play this game over and over.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Was never able to play because it kept freezing and would not load. can't give more details since I couldn't play it
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Prior to watching this I had no experience of Jack Reacher. I enjoyed the acting and the action. I enjoyed Tom's performance and that of the other actors.<br /><br />I like how the adventure continued even after we knew the shooter. Apparently the movie was a take off of Child's novel One Shot. As a Star Trek fan I have no problems with alternate realities. So, I look forward to exploring Child's writing style and story telling.<br /><br />Aloha.. Allen
055357342X|5.0|Description was for a used book in acceptable condition.  I saw nothing in this book that made it &#34; acceptable&#34; as it was as good as new in my estimation.  I am enjoying the book and look forward to the season 4 dvd
B00B2V66VS|2.0|this was not my type of game so I did not keep it on my kindle. So I cannot give a fair rating
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I play this with my sister and we like it so you will have fun too hopefully me and her even compete with it .....so there you go
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|I saw the movie in my youth and thought I would get the &#34;real story&#34; by reading the book but it got boring and as a result I didn't complete it. I'm going to revisit the movie when I get a chance and see if it isn't better as a visual ecperience for an adult.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Lots of different levels block games pictures ease to play and find good graphics  short time on some levels makes you a better player
B002SAUCBC|3.0|I 've enjoyed reading this book but it is DISTURBING with the way things are in the world today. Love Steven KIng!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is my favorite but on 0.7.3 it crashes whenever you try to use a bucket on kindle so there's water all over my favorite world and I cant get it away
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I read the book in my teenage years and really enjoyed it. I didn't recall so much mistreatment of the dog. Those things are easier to deal with as an adult. But that is not to say the mistreatment is OK.
1780721676|5.0|Easy to do a quick skim for the what it is and how to implement it parts. Then, engaging to go back and read the background information that supports it. It makes so much sense and I've watched a significant person in my life lose a significant amount of weight following it. I'm on my way.
B0011UF792|5.0|smart, irreverently reverent and funny as Hell!! Kevin Smith works out some of his own inner demons from being raised Catholic in a way that still shows respect for faithful.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Good game for kids to play at a young age. Not too hard and is very cute. Would recommend to all for an easy blow off stem after a long day and great for the kiddos. Do I really have to keep writing about
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone that is romantic, wants excitement. this one will make you cry a little,good movie as well as The notebook.
0553062182|4.0|This book was very insightful for both myself and my daughter, even though we individually have different sensitivities-- it's a good read!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I liked all the three books but said previously said. ...did someone forget to send the manuscript to the editor
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever I would reccomend u get this game its totally worth it every day I play it and this game is good for your imagination.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Three book like before is a very interesting read. Story takes on new characters and twists them into beautifully intervened play.
1567184855|3.0|The book didn't really &#34;grab&#34; me as I thought it was more about soul journeys in our present lives and not just about life after death  and those who come back from the dead.
B003477DVK|4.0|Sweet story about a boy's love of his dog and how the dog helped him grow as a young man.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Do not believe all you hear about Mr. Card; this book is deeper than you know.  You do yourself and humanity a disservice if you choose to ignore what he has to say here. There are few books written in any genre that are as prescient as this one was.  Do not miss it.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|I'm a relatively new reader of the YA Fantasy genre, but it was only a matter of time before I migrated over from paranormal. After reading this book, you might too.<br /><br />At a family reunion, Oria decides to go for a swim, but when she dives beneath the water she comes out on the \\"other\\" side. She's only 18, but now she is also the queen of a new land and the responsibly of her new title is overwhelming.<br /><br />Written in first person, the reader is given a front seat view of Oria's struggles. This book is filled with magic, shape shifters, and a fantastastical new world that will leave you wanting more. I'm onto the second one, but if you enjoy YA, Fantasy, shape shifters, or magic then I think you'll enjoy this book.<br /><br />**As with most of my reviews, I was received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review**
B00AHHODH2|5.0|Not what I expected but surprisingly a good read. I would recommend this book for someone who can appreciate quirky and from savannah.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|If I understood Twitter and how to use it fully. Otherwise it keeps me updated with things in this world that hold my interest.
B00DHRLK84|2.0|Acting 5/10<br />special effects 6/10<br />Plot 5/10<br />Overall entertainment 4/10<br />3D 2/10<br /><br />Yes, it is another zombie/apocalyptic movie. Although the zombies are presented in a different way (smarter or with stronger survival instincts), it is not enough to make this movie stick-out from the rest of the zombie movies/TV shows already in the market. The 3D is completely unnecessary and overused.<br /><br />The plot has some minor twists but basically is another story where the survivors try to escape the zombies and find a cure. And of course there is the \\"revelation\\" that the only way to kill the zombies is by shooting in their heads. Yes, it is full of cliches.
B00EFB8UHU|5.0|i didn't think stromae could top &#34;cheese&#34; - but i loved the creativity and variety behind his second album. &#34;papaoutai&#34; has been stuck in my head for months, but i've been playing every track over and over and over...
B009KS4XRO|2.0|My best friend turned me onto this game (yeah I said FRIEND), and in the beginning I loved it. We play bingo at some of our local parlors, but we had cut-back lately because of the expense. So this was right on time, we could play together and help each other out, great free fun. At the start anyway, as we got further into the game and more hooked on it things started changing. The bingo cards that used to cost 2-6 credits to play are now costing u 7-10 credits. And when u only get 79 credits a day, that's not many rounds of bingo. If u 're lucky enough to bingo u never win as much as it cost u to play so u never recoup and/or grow your credits.  Same thing for the slot games, only some of those r worse.  There are WILD signs in some of the rooms and the only way to win them is thru scatter, and oh by the way you have to be betting 100 coins on 20 lines to even get a chance.  So by now u are hooked on this \\"game\\" and in order to keep playing u need more credits but u don't want to wait until the next day but oh look, they will sell u some.  How great is that, and hey it's only $4.99 or $7.99, that's not bad.  Before u know it u are buying  the $30 and $50 items and soon u discover if would have been cheaper to go to the local bingo hall!  Oh,  almost forgot, what everyone says is true, games start freezing up, you lose items you FINALLY won, stuff u bought doesn't get credited,  but they took your money,no problem.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This book keeps you turning the pages! It is a great book and i plan on reading the rest of the books by this author. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My kids love this movie and watch it over and over again.  We pretty much know it by heart now.
160459201X|2.0|I really couldn't gain from the content because the print was very small and strained my eyes. I didn't care for the format but the information was valuable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Awesome.  What a finale!!  So unexpected! Looking forward to the next season! And the seasons after that and more and more.
B0070YDOT8|5.0|having fun with all the game selections and making good choices and making money so far, so good for now
B0059WTMLW|4.0|Good game for those of us that can't get enough Sudoku! Give it a try you will like it !
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I dont even like books like these but I loved this book. It makes you truly think about human nature and how ruthless we are when we are scared and desperate. This was so much better than the movie!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great way to pass a few minutes!  Who doesn't want to get back at those nasty pigs.  This is so worth the price!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome! Can't wait for the movie. Second time I've read the book, just as good the second time if not better.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Great for kids and adults. Funny but with a good plot and moral. A must see for everyone, young and old.
1609611543|5.0|I was troubled for 3 years about my continually upset stomach until I read Dr. Davis's book. He explains the dangers for some of us in the food we eat., mainly Wheat, Barley, Rye and some Oats.  His research is large and very convincing.  I had been told about my allergies to these grains but it took Dr. Davis to really prove to me the dangers of these foods.  More people than one would suspect are allergic to them.  Too bad our foods are no longer pure--too many chemicals are added and they are destroying our bodies.
1481879103|5.0|This well written story about a recently deceased woman who discovers she can communicate with the living, unlike her new ghost friends, is very original and imaginative; like no other ghost story I have read before! It was really fun to read. I did not want to put the book down and liked the unexpected ending. Hightly recommended!
B00000J2PH|5.0|This is a really nice album, it has a lot of great songs on it, and takes me away to the 70;s once again.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I was delighted with this book as it went a long way in explaining what &#34;shaped&#34; Harr's psyche. I have read all other Harry Hole novels, but this one answered most of the lingering questions about what went so wrong in Harry's early life. Any serious fan of this series needs to read this book!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|This is my favorite animation of all time!  Every chance I get I will watch it and share it with my family.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I would really have enjoyed this movie, but every five minutes the film would falter, stop, and finally freeze for at least five minutes before it would continue. I have tried every way I know to accomplish a regular flow, but the film keeps locking with a symbol suggesting that a bad connection was causing the problem. I generally have good connection with my other programs, so I don't understand the difficulty with amazon.com movies. Please, someone, help. I could provide an excellent review of Liam's acting and the gripping movie, but every time I found myself absorbed with the characters and the action, I would receive a \\"freeze frame,\\" which, in movie watching is very distressing. My thanks.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Really? I think this album speaks for itself. Its an awesome CD, so many memories from the 70's, along with a tune or two with the great James Taylor. I have listened to it over and over.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Good story and good acting. Nice to see a movie that is more about characters and their interactions. Yes it has a plot, sorely missing from most of the new movies.
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|It's okay, but after a few minutes I was bored of playing it.  For what it's worth, my 5 year old thinks it's amazing...
B005LAII4E|4.0|I'm on the fence still. I grew up playing with all the GI Joe toys that my mom ended up giving away. LOL. And I watched the afternoon cartoons and read the comics. It's hard seeing named actors (The Rock, Bruce Willis etc..) being the characters I used to play with as a kid. They could've used new actors and got the same if not better results, and saved a ton of money! The story isn't bad, but they kill off Joes by the dozen. I wish they would've stuck more to the old scripts, and the CGI in this one wasn't bad but I miss the old days of realistic fight scenes.<br /><br />But, this is just my opinion. You should watch this with your kids, enjoy it, and make up your own opinion. It's worth buying.
B000059MEL|5.0|This album has been with me since childhood. It got me addicted to Daft Punk! The songs are all sampled, yes, but they did it in an original way!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|From trailers you might think it is an action movie, but it is pretty straight forward scifi, if you are a scifi fan you probably will like this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Having two young children, my home is constantly bombarded with animated films.  Most of which make me want to pull my hair out.  Despicable Me on the other hand is one that I really enjoy (probably because Steve Carell is awesome as Gru).  Anyway, I downloaded this app for my kids, and it has quickly become my favorite time wasting game.  It's far more addicting and entertaining than all of the other running games, primarily because minions are so much more fun to watch than the Temple Run dude or the Subway Surfer.  Plus Minion Rush has &#34;mini games&#34; like the Unicorn, Vector Battle, etc.  Great game!
B00B3N4CWK|4.0|This was a beautiful film, and a rather faithful adaptation of a novel that I consider an American classic, but it is missing some of the subplots that make the novel so interesting. The film is an adaptation of John Irving's novel by the author himself, which makes it feel like you are very connected to the story, but I felt like it left out some fairly important aspects of the novel including some aspects that would have explained the ending more throughly. I missed having the Mary Agnes storyline from the novel as well. While I felt like the film was lacking in some of those deeper story lines, I did enjoy it. I would recommend that if you enjoyed the novel you see the film as well, and if you've already watched the film and you're looking for a wonderful novel that you read the book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed both the acting and cinematography of this film. It dealt with deep issues in a believable and thoughtful manner, and it should give pause to those who see the issue of abortion as black and white.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|i think it is very cute to play with and very cool! i just love how it is soooo cute and like, i dont know how to explain it, just plain old CUTE! :D
B005TBWN0K|5.0|Being able to select a screenshot or a photo and edit it (and then save it straight to Evernote) make this an excellent app for people interesting in cross-platform capability.
1400067820|2.0|Five percent information and ninety-five percent noise, the premise could all be posted in a standard op-ed piece. Throughout the book, he accuses others of cherry-picking and teleological thinking mired in domain dependence, yet that defines his approach precisely. This with the ceaseless ad hominem attacks, makes this more Taleb's exercise of mental masturbation than informative reading. Do yourself a favour. Take it for granted that fragility and anti-fragility exist (in a manner similar to matter and anti-matter) and that in some circumstances you can benefit by the asymmetry of convexity, and save yourself the hours you might otherwise spend reading this, as I have  done. Each book Taleb releases is progressively worse than the last, a second order, negative convexity event, so you might prefer an earlier work, [[ASIN:0812975219 Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets]]. I cringe at the thought of another offering by Taleb.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Download this one. Its a real hit. You wont be disappointed! A real upbeat track great for dancing and workouts
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i like it becuase i think it is more challenging and very fun to play! good for all ages! :3
B00AAQVSDW|4.0|I think the album is very, very good. I have been listening to country music sporadically for a while now, and I have been hearing this group's songs on the radio. I finally decided to buy it, and it reminds me of a good ole time in Georgia, where I am from, and TN, where I reside. Good album, and nice beats!
1423113381|5.0|My daughter had to read this for school and she couldn't put it down.  She really enjoyed it and was looking for more books by this author
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|If you love UNO card game,you'll love this! I spend much time as possible to challenge anybody and everybody. What are you waiting for...let's play!
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Death of Kings is a wonderfully written continuation of the Saxon Chronicles. This series is a marvelous introduction to the origin of England as a country, a well thought out historical novel.<br /><br />Lullaby, great airplane reading.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was quite confused in the beginning and didn't like the back and forth stories of the different people.  If was fair.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|it was a good series not sure how long it will last but love to get the set and give to my grand daughter
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Such a beautifully written book doesn't come along very often. Savor this book, and don't read it all at once.
B008EZVNFE|3.0|Entire album is average but with clear evidence of an up and coming artist of talent artist with good musicianship.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|who really cares what someone else thinks this will be my first and last review.<br />This is to notify whoever that I do not fill in required fields. Bye
B0049P1VHS|5.0|it was a good series not sure how long it will last but love to get the set and give to my grand daughter
B009RH9J7W|4.0|Love this case.  The revolving feature is really great.  I recommend to anyone looking to get a case for their Kindle.
B0055D3EFU|4.0|I have watched this movie 5 times and always seem to find something I haven't seen previously.  This isn't the predictable slasher horror movie that is typical of today's releases.  Looking forward to Insidious Chapter 2.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Great flick...I didn't have to concentrate in order to follow the the action .. Bruce was Bruce  he never let's me down also great supporting cast
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|she loved it we watched the movie and really enjoyed it and enjoyed all the music from that time period
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Probably, best zombie story out there.  I just found out I'm not that into the fake assumption Zombies have taken over the world
B0052AC8C6|5.0|The &#34;special guest star&#34; near the end was a pleasant surprise.  Fun story, with a moral suitable for everyone but the smallest children.
1451695195|2.0|The book was more about his illness then anything else.  He was not very detailed about his experiences but maybe that is all he saw.
B00005QB42|3.0|whatever, she does remind me of my sister. can't say much else the cd isn't great or annoying it just is.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|It wasn't as good as some of his previous movies.  The acting was marginally good and the dialog was painful at times.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|As an avid brain puzzle gamer, this one is intriguingly addictive with a great combination of numbers, colours, and memory based exercises.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|Did not resolve the problem<br />The kindle itself has a very loose USB re-charging portal.<br />Regardless of what kind of charging combo we use it will not re-charge fully or sometimes even partially. You have to sit and hold it with your hand very carefully to keel the charger engaged.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Sadly my wife could not understand it.  One particular problem is with the female roles.  None of the them speak clearly and project their voices such that the audience can understand their words.  The problem may be with the producers not understanding speech quality and thus producing poor quality sound (voices) and sometimes coupled with loud background music.  This problem seems to be typical in many movies today but certainly not all of them.  This one has a lot of big noise scenes but the voice only ones stink.  Overall, if one understands the intent the viewer can watch and be entertained but many people will be lost.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|i am addicted to this song it is a very good song gaga is a good artist tbh hah hah hahah
B00BWWS81S|5.0|There's definitely a melancholy throughout it, and maybe I'm just relating to it more now than I would, say a year from now, but I think it's her best yet. More introspective than any of her other efforts. It's been in my car's CD player since I bought it back on 8/8. Looking forward to hearing some of these songs live.
0812416317|5.0|I wasn't excited to read this book for summer reading but as soon as I started reading I got hooked. Definitely recommend this book.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Great cast.  Putting together a special group of policemen to fight crime is a movie plot done many times, but this was done well.  Highly recommend the movie.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Kick Ass is titled very appropriately! Very action packed, and deep at the same time! This was one heck of a deal at only $7.50 at the time of purchase. Buy it here unless you like overpaying.
1476712042|5.0|Couldn't put this book down! I fell in love with the characters. It is very relatable to the emotions many young adults feel at one point or another.
0802473156|5.0|This is a book all married couples should read! My husband and I have both read it and really have learned from it!
B002WPVNOS|5.0|Love every single minute of this album! Can't stay away from it! Don't know why I found it this late! I recomend it to anyone that has a desire to listen to it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Such a fun game to play! So much to do, this game will keep you busy for hours. I definitely will tell all my friends about it!
B008IJTFYW|3.0|Great app but it needs a timer feature so that it doesn't drain your battery all night! Please add this!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great script, great cast, great acting, great costumes, great scenery.<br />This is my favorite show.<br /><br />What more could I ask?
B000YKG5L4|5.0|Love every single minute of this album! Can't stay away from it! Don't know why I found it this late! I recomend it to anyone that has a desire to listen to it!
1451695195|4.0|I found this experience spellbinding and very interesting.  I found some things I questioned but on the whole I  liked it and would recommend  it to anyone.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Excellent game. This is by far my favorite bingo. I wish they would give you credits more often. That's my only complaint
B006ZDS7CE|3.0|I like her smoky slow vocals but there is also a semi-rap section of songs that seem confused to me. Lyrical depth is a bit shallow throughout the album as well. That being said, it was a good album for the cost
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Mr. Tedder is a pure genoius! Love every single minute of this album! Can't stay away from it! I strongly recomend it to anyone that has any desire to listen to it!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I would recommend this to all families with young and older children. It was entertaining and clever. Try it you will like it!
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is an awesome game I love playing this game. It's a good way to pass the time when you get bored and it keeps your mind thinking too.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I enjoyed the futuristic movie. It keeps you in plugged in the whole time. I would suggest this movie for any family.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great game for anyone. It's fun to complete the quests and breed different dragons. Sometimes things take a long time to complete but it's worth it.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Being an Ex pat Aussie I loved reading Bryson's take on the unique land that is Australia. Highly recommended for anybody.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|I played this for the iPhone as well as the tablet, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I love AIW so it was a must have game for me - I love the scenery, it's absolutely stunning, as well as the puzzles - it was actually very challenging for me, and I'm a seasoned gamer, although not too experienced with these types of games. I look forward to the next installment too! My only complaint would be some of the backtracking that was involved, like having to go back to the cave when you're already at the Queen's castle, but this is an exploration game, and you are traveling in the AIW world, so it made sense that it was programmed that way. Puzzles weren't too difficult either, although some items I couldn't see, and had to use hints to get them.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this, and it's well worth the 1.99, and will keep you entertained for hours!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great storytelling.  Twists and turns keep you guessing and second guessing.  Loved the ending because it was unexpected.  Great book club discussion!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love this show! Just quality stuff! It obviously isn't the most accurate with how real lawyers practice, but it has some awesome ideas and just a good all around show!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love the alarm app! The sleep timer is my favorite. I love that I can shuffle all of my favorite music
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I had not thought that this series was one that I would want to watch, but I could not find something to watch, so earlier this year I ended up watching one of the episodes, & I fell in love with this series. So I just wanted to own the series, plus I need to do back & watch the first few seasons.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This was a very entertaining way for Dave Grohl to tell the story of Nirvana, Sound City, and especially the Neve board which was some great historic information. Highly recommend to anyone who's a fan of the classic and/or alt rock scene. Dave Grohl is a legend!
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|I chose this app because of my love for astronomy.There is so much you can do with this app and I'm still learning its capabilities
B009WUAK2M|4.0|what i like most is those old actors who remind me a great generation of cinema<br />advise you watching this movie<br />enjoy it
B000WC39ZY|5.0|This movie is one of the great movies of out times. So if you want to own a great movie this is it.
B00CZAYL76|5.0|Amazing hard core stuff. I love the remake of Momma Said Knock You Out.  Surprisingly enough this music puts in a great mood.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great fun, enjoyable creative playing rooms to take away from the boredom of only one bingo room and caller other bingo apps use
B000VDDWE2|5.0|Our movie was damaged and when I found this one at a great price I knew I had to buy it.We have enjoyed watching it.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love bruno mars and this album is just as great as his first one. Songs are fun, upbeat and great to drive to. It's one of my favorite CDs!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was beautifully written, a powerful story full of often heart wrenching emotion, much like The Kite Runner. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, whether you are familiar with this author or not. I couldn't put it down!
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|The only thing I don't like about this app is that you can't move backwards, otherwise I have liked checkers for a long time time, I like it.
B004XC5LP0|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for a while because  my son really likes it.So glad I found it he was so happy.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I love JT, I always have and always will but I must admit, some of these songs are just too long! Other than that, it's great!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love how much detail goes into the costumes and the settings. The plot is always interesting and the dialogue is intelligent and has a great sense of humor.<br />I did not like the ending of the season, but I can see how it will add to the plots and the intrigues.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I downloaded what was there, I thought it was candy crush saga, that's what I really wanted, I will look again this one I don't need. I hope amazon have the regular candy crush saga that's what I want. I love candy crush saga!!
B000V39KDO|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie. All my friends raved about it. This movie is SO melodramatic. I almost turned it off, but decided to stick it through to see if it improved. It doesn't.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I didn't want the stories to end! Great author, I have loved all his books so far. A must read if you like this suthor
B00005JKG9|3.0|My husband got this as he owns a small business involved in sales. He loved the crazy (now famous) speech given but the rest of the movie he found to be strange. But, because he loves watching the speech so much, three stars!
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|This book was so good I read 11 times!! My favorite thing about this book is that it is hilarious. There is not a moment you are not laughing!!!! I congratulate Chris Colfer on an amazing book!!!
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|This is not a great game.  Would not purchase it if I knew. It was free so was not out of any money.
031603441X|5.0|excellent book for anyone interested in the music culture-very well written-excellent insight into the man his music and his personal life
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie has its corny moments but the message is amazing. The content makes you think and the storyline is wonderful. I recommend this to every father desiring guidance or growth.
0143034901|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful novel. Its the first of several \\"Barcelona\\" novels by Spanish writer, Carlos Ruiz Zafon and its the exciting and unpredictable story of a boy who finds a long lost book in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and tries to find out about Julian Carax, the mysterious author of the volume. Incidentally, in a world of e-readers and the internet, the Cemetery of Forgotten Books stands as one of the great fictional creations of recent years.<br /><br />Anyway, what the the boy finds in his search for Carax includes an intricate, real-life Romeo and Juliet story and a faceless man who is burning all of the copies of Carax's books. The boy also encounters an interesting homeless man who eventually goes to work for the boy's father in his bookstore. There's also a murder, a lot of coming of age stuff, an excellent portrait of a Paris writer in a cold water flat and an evil villain to boot.<br /><br />The tone of the book is fun and Zafon obviously has great respect for the impact of literature on people's lives. All in all, this is a thoughtful, well written, intelligent novel by a major international literary talent.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Really love the game but tech help is extremely slow. Many problems with credits. But I keep playing so it must be good.
0425188809|5.0|Koontz is one of my favorite authors-this is the book that turned me on to him-reread it-it is still I think his best book
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Very difficult for this listener to maneuver through through this Internet radio app. Unfortunately, as far as I know, its the only one available for picking up overseas stations.<br /><br />The two foriegn stations I want to receive are problematic. One is constantly cutting in and out and the volume on the other is so weak that the audio requires earphones to be heard clearly.<br /><br />Support consists of allowing you to send an on-site email request or complaint that is never addressed or resolved.<br /><br />For me, the iHeart app provides a much superior product for radio listening.<br /><br />I bought the Pro version, thinking the quality would improve, but the same porblems carried over - a real amateur operation.<br /><br />Maybe if you are into recording radio broadcasts, it might be worth your while to buy this app - otherwise I recommend you not waste your time or money for this app as I have.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Smartly written, terrifically cast, beautifully filmed, with lots and lots of castle intrigue -- perfect fare for your evening enjoyment.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Originally aired for television in the USA simply titled as &#34;The Riders of the Wind&#34;, this classic is one of the most accessible anim&eacute; films, readily enjoyed by both genre officianados and the uninitiated audience.<br /><br />The animation is fairly sophisticated and smooth-flowing, not as overly simplified and rushed-looking as some of the more recent works in the genre. The sentiment expressed in the plotline is overtly heroic and romantic without being overwrought; the arch of the story unwinds in such an unrushed fashion that the &#34;mesage&#34; is conveyed naturally, not at all overplayed.<br /><br />The version sold by Amazon incorporates some scenes and incidental material absent from the version I recorded from a television broadcast aired in the late 1990s, but neither version suffers unduly because of these minor differences. The additional material is surprising, but not upsettingly so.<br /><br />This is a real piece of animation high art. If you want a good introduction to this genre, this is where you should start.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It captures you into their lives with the very first episode, first season.  I found myself almost &#34;thinking&#34; with a British accent.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Going to Paris for the first time but that's irrelevant to seeing this movie.  It was delightful!  See it and smile
B0046B1KHG|5.0|My 8 year old loved the movie.  Funny, great ending and very cute.  All her words.  We recommend it for sure.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The depth of characters in this series is phenomenal. I haven't ever been so engrossed in a TV series. My only regret is that we only have one season left to watch before we are caught up!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is a great tower game. I've played lotsa tower games and this one is worth the 2 bucks. I'm on level 19 and this boss level is actually challenging. Totally worth it.
B007L24T52|5.0|What a good book, couldn´t put it down, sorry when it came to the end, David Baldacci holds you in suspense all the say through.
0064471837|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite fantasy books. What really makes it great is Nix's innovative world building combined with a kickass heroine. The magic system regarding necromancy and the control of the undead through Sabriel's bandolier of bells feels extremely fresh and surprises the reader as it is explored. Even better, the way this system is predisposed toward some great writing  as it is enacted in the book and is even eerily reminiscent of classics like Poe's poem The Bells and Pink Floyd's High Hopes. The characters are also great- I love female characters who are strong and powerful but are also allowed some human vulnerability. Mogget makes one of the most intriguing sidekicks I think I've seen and the romance adds a likable feature without detracting from the adventure story- after all, the reader has signed up to see Sabriel save first herself, then her father, and finally the world, not just fall in love. Overall, great book with one of the more surprising quest stories that I've seen.
B005L12SB2|5.0|I had most of these on CD but did not have the Monolith, AudioVisions or Drastic Measures remastered, so I picked this up, getting all the Kirshner-era albums for the price of the three I did not have. Kansas was the soundtrack of my college years, so it's nostalgia and music that I still enjoy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's great. Get the app its awesome! I love this game. I play this every day. Play it now ok.
B0031R5K68|5.0|I love Dan Brown Books, they are so full of interesting facts, makes me want to re-visit Rome once again and put the authors theories to work.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|I'll admit that when I started reading this, the best I would have given was three stars.  It moves a bit slowly, jumping from character to character (or rather, their minds) but the last 1/3 in particular will keep you reading.<br /><br />Savannah...slow, Southern city.  We visit a lovely, upscale neighborhood, four women who are good friends with a touch of bitchiness, and one is on her deathbed.  Throw in some hunky men, a young family with baby and you may start to think \\"Didn't I see this on TV?\\" as there's a definite \\"Desperate Housewives\\" vibe.<br /><br />You know from the beginning that someone is going to die...a killer waits for his target.  As you read, you think you know who it will be...but wait, maybe it's her?  No, perhaps him?  The ending is worth the ride.
B001KEGRC0|5.0|I've bought this video before visiting the Grand Canyon and was excellent decision.  I watch it twice beafore traveling and it opens some hided ideass
B00821OX98|4.0|I don't know how I missed this series originally. Into season2 now and it hasn't gone too weird yet. Watch it. . .
B005I3PAUO|5.0|This book was excellent - a very good read, couldn´t put it down, held my interest sorry when it came to the end.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I didn't expect much so I was pleasantly surprised.  I would of tamed down the language and dropped a suggested but not shown masturbation scene.  However, the movie had enough humor and action to make it worth adding to my shelf.  I am looking forward to Kick-Ass 2.
B0095H4FAA|5.0|After seeing the original movie, I just had to read the book. The book was fabulous! Great characters, fast-paced plot, and lots of action.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This show seems to focus as much if not more on human interactions instead of just fighting an alien menace.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have become addicted to this show and can hardly wait to see the next season.  The story line and cast are outstanding.
140006922X|5.0|The perfect book for those who want to know Jesus the person. No matter what faith or beliefs you are raised with, seeing Jesus as a real historical figure is an amazing experience. The book reveals the power and influence of history's greatest philosopher without the smoke and mirrors. I found what I have been missing all these years.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Excellent game, quite addictive, and fun. I recommend this to anyone who loves building villages. I can't put it down
B00CISC2DA|4.0|Boards of Canada have almost inoculated themselves against criticism, they are so vague, and release so little material that if they were to release an album of white noise and bird tweets their fan base would go mad and rate it the most forward and interesting music in decades.  I am a major fan, and was so happy that this album was released, that I jumped to it like the rest of us. I bought vinyl, cd and FLAC versions of this album - deep down I felt maybe if I supported them in this way they would give more to all the poor starving BOC fans out there.<br /><br />Several months have passed since the release of this album and I am now more able to take it apart critically.  First, the good - the album is tremendously layered and interesting to listen to, particularly in headphones, and they seem to have gone back a notch by simplifying their arsenal and ignoring the light hearted, hyper mid range-y sound that annoyed some listeners of Campfire Headphase. The bass is awesome, and takes center stage. They also appear to be working in a fully analog sphere on this album, the arpeggiators and synths, rhythms and filters all sound decidedly old school - and this is a major plus.  The mood of the album is dark, atonal, almost existing between two states of mind, and this gives Tomorrow's Harvest a riveting and pertinent narrative. It is unveiled like a film, opening with a salutary trumpet which plays like the title card of a now defunct action movie company. There are songs that burst with a certain joy of reaching a climax during the best jam sessions (Jaquard Causeway) and solid brain-mashing beats (Cold Earth), and lots and lots of classic Boards of Canada interludes that act as transitions or might also be signs of life from a recently deserted space craft (Telepath, Transmissions ferox). The comedown - Semena Mertvykh (in mono!) is probably the best composed track on the album, a haunting aftermath of whatever destruction was being illustrated in the tracks that preceded it.  Herein lies the problem, for me at least.<br /><br />When I think back to my favorite BOC albums (MHTR2C, Beautiful Place out in the Country and Geogaddi in that order), and think about the songs in that album I can immediately hear them in my head.  I cannot hear a single song from this album in my head when I think back to it, except maybe the frolicsome Nothing is Real.  What I am missing most, and what I kept waiting to hear when first listening- was a song with melody (Dawn Chorus, Beautiful Place, Olson), a satisfying breakdown or climax (Julie and Candy, Pete Standing Alone), a song that kicked my butt with a new sound or technique (check - most of their prior albums) or a song that was more structured than a continuous loop presented with varying degrees of overlaying texture.  This I was not given.  The final track presented - almost mockingly - their best composed piece of material in a decade.  While there are songs that reach climaxes,  they appear almost as the result of jam sessions rather than carefully thought out, mathematically composed pieces of music.  The world has also been inundated with so much electronica, so many new genres and resultant sub-genres (mostly out of the UK) since Campfire Headphase - that maybe it was asking too much to expect Tomorrow's Harvest to come around and present us the next paradigm shift.  While I am certainly glad that Tomorrow's Harvest is not a wobble infused BOC take on dubstep - I am not sure whether the brothers proclamation to not really listen to much new electronica is a good or bad thing.  Parts of this album feel like a relic, and granted - that might be the entire purpose of it.<br /><br />Does Tomorrow's Harvest break new ground? No.  Is it one of their greatest albums? Not really.  But TH contains a lot of great, densely layered material that immediately casts an evocative mood and haunts you with it.  I won't ask for more right now.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|Classic.  Top 50 ever if you like action with less words and a plot you can understand without the vulgarity of most movies.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|I knew the film was well regarded but had some concern that it would be a Hollywood morality tale that has not historically plausible.  This was not the case.  This was a very good, believable story with superb acting.  The casting was outstanding.  Viola Davis did an especially good job.
B00DMKFN34|2.0|Let me preface this by saying I NEVER walk out on movies. Not only that I love kids movies, I love cartoons. I'm middle aged and half of what I watch is Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network cartoons. The other half is House Flipping, Real Estate, Cars shows, and Mainstream Hollywood Action, Adventure, or Sci-Fi movies.<br /><br />I went to see Planes in 3D in the Theater, even got passes for free. It felt like make for video movie. The animation was lacking in detail. The 3D was flat. The story was almost not existent and much to similar to the first Cars movie. The dialog was lacking in emotion. There was simply no passion or life in the movie.<br /><br />People that know me know that I will watch just about anything, especially b-movies. Something so bad it's good you know. There was just very little here. It was almost like that old watching paint drying saying. I wanted to see the movie. I wanted to be there. I wanted to enjoy it. The longer I was there the movie I felt like I was just forcing myself to be there. After a while everyone else in my group started confessing the same thing. Twenty some minutes into the movie we felt bad, but just had to leave.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|I love Harlen's books! I can't wait to start the next book, so many to choose from... Where to start
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Acting is superb. Gorier season than previous but worth it. Streamed it with amazon prime and did not have any issues.
B0017QSZW6|4.0|I love this show!  Although they take their own liberties with historical fact the essence of the shows entertainment is excellent.
B009R659L8|5.0|Surprised me towards the end with the switch in brothers.  Really great ending.  As always Mary Higgins Clark was art her best.  Love. All other books.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|It is not often that I find myself liking every song on an album on the first listen. Well worth the cost.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show, watched season 1 on Netflix, was very disappointed when they didn't have Season 2 and 3. Thank heavens for Amazon Prime was able to watch season 2 and 3 FREE . Amazon Prime is one of the best deals on the market as far as I am concerned.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Phone used on: Samsung Galaxy Reverb<br /><br />I picked this up a while back when it was free, if you can get this for free it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />You start the game off waking up from bed and you can then choose to go into any of the &#34;upgrade&#34; rooms but, you want to start off by just going down to the bottom and going into the dungeon. Once you click on the dungeon door it'll show you what type of monsters you'll fight and 3 side objectives for extra money/resources.<br /><br />Now once you enter, it's like your common match 3 or more of the same tile to progress like Candy Crush or Bejeweled. There are 7 types of tiles (Melee, Magic, Shield, Key, Wood, Ore & Treasure). At the top is your character and he'll just start running, depending on what he runs into is what you want to try to line up.  So, if he runs into a chest, you want to line up 3+ Key tiles to unlock it (which might contain one of a few different types of usable items). Once you fall back to the furthest left of the screen it's game over.<br /><br />Overall: The game was great to pick up and play for a short while, I got it for free though so it was well worth it, not sure I'd pay more than $1 for it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great pickup and play value<br />Able to unlock/upgrade things<br />Fairly easy to learn<br />Extra side objectives earn extra money/resources<br />Clean game that runs well no crashes or slow downs<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can get repetitive<br />If you're doing very well your character will go to the far right side of the screen and you can't see what's coming next.<br />Once you exit the game it'll keep your characters unlocks and what level you're at but you lose your items you were carrying from chests. (not a huge deal since they're easy to get)
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|It is a good family time weekend movie. My entire household liked it and it kept as entertained.<br />It starts the journey all over again; and I look forward to the next part.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had so many moments in this book where that's what I thought-oh no she didn't.  That didn't really just happen.  Holy crap-I didn't see that coming.  This book was amazing!  I didn't think I would like it because it was about teenagers falling in love, but it grabbed my attention and kept me riveted until the end and wanting more.  Unbelievable writing and the story that came out of it, the heartbreak and triumph.  Simply amazing!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this calculator because it easy to use. I don't need reading glasses for it. it keeps a history of your calculations. I recommend this app.
6305428352|5.0|I loved it.  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It was funny and sad.  It's a great movie for any family member.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|There is not much to say about the Aliens Anthology; You either are a fan or not. My family watched over the long weekend and we enjoyed it. No complains about being on the couch all that time.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Not worth it even though its free. I could've gone on YouTube and looked it up myself. Really didn't show how to get past level 65. Just how that person did it with that configuration of the tiles.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A fascinating story written by one of my favorite authors. His depth of understanding of his culture and its history and his talent for weaving the lives of such wounded, interesting people into such a beautiful tapestry of a story is truly unique.
B001H4NXCK|5.0|I bought this on DVD.  I already had it on VHS.  It was hilarious.  My favorite scene was the stage coach ride.  Mel Gibson was a laugh a minute.  There were a lot of great actors.  Mel Gibson, Jody Foster, James Garner ect, ect.. You need to buy this.  No bad language and anyone can watch this.
1883217040|5.0|This was the text for my Jazz Theory class, and really lined up the material well -- an understandable progression of theory concepts that build on each other to show how everything from 9 to altered chords are used.
0316066524|2.0|This author's popularity is a mystery to me after wallowing through as much of his book as I could stand.  Footnotes in a novel-- very amusing.  Grandiose psycho-mathematical notions-- very impressive.  Incredible longwindedness-- very... long. It has been interesting to watch the cheerleading literary establishment duck and weave about him since his, for them, embarrassing suicide.  The New York Times Book Review: \\"One of the main criticisms of Wallace's work is that he simply mirrored decay and malaise instead of moving through and beyond them.  This was, not infrequently, one of his main concerns.  But the more nattering and pervasive complaint...is that he is just too brainy and aggressively difficult--just too, well, MEAN. Let's disagree.\\" Actually, let's not disagree.<br />Maybe Infinite Jest is a highbrow version of middlebrow Atlas Shrugged, the twentieth century's most popular novel.  According to the New Yorker Magazine, readers adore Ayn Rand's weighty tome because getting all the way through it gives them a sense of accomplishment and superior solidarity with her rugged individualist \\"philosophy.\\" I suppose Infinite Jest has some kind of \\"philosophy\\" in it, somewhere.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|A very interesting and moving story, not particularly about the so-call heroine, but about her prison mates. The story clearly demonstrated that the prison personnel deserved to be in the cells, and the so-called criminals released in many cases. It is  so a perfect illustration of why our prisons are so over-crowded--needlessly. Many of the women she talked about had very long prison terms for what some would consider misdemeanors. The whole prison and &#34;justice&#34; systems in the US seem dedicated to making hardcore criminals out of women who have landed in prison for defending themselves against abusive partners, spouses or pimps, or young girls who used poor judgment, rather than educating them and preparing them to avoid making the same mistakes again when released. So many wasted lives!
B005K17RU0|3.0|A little hard to find what you are looking for. A key for all the little symbols used would be nice as well. The forecast taday looks like there is a 75% chance of a tornado??? I hope not! Wish I knew what they meant.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We took Catan into a game store to have the professionals teach us how to play it because the rule book is daunting!  But once you learn how to play, it's very enjoyable.  My 12-year-old and I love it, and we even got my husband to play, and he's not a great lover of board games.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season was as good as the previous two.  It has some very interesting twists, turns and surprises through out!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I love the entire series this far.  I feel transported to another time, and feel like I have come to think of some of these characters as friends.  I will be sad to say goodbye to them when the series is done.<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons was good, but I feel like it didnt have the momentum we saw with A Feast for Crows.  I am looking forward to the 2 battle scenes in the next book.  I would especially be interested to see if Daenerys will return to Kings Landing and how that will unfold!
B009ME47H2|3.0|This voice recorder is extremely soft sound.  It is difficult to hear when playing back the recording.  I would not recommend it.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Okay, it would have been better if the movie could be streamed with subtitles - Stallone definitely slurs his lines.  If you like mindless action filled movies then this is for you.  I really liked it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|not toddler friendly.  my 3 year old has a hard time playing and understanding how it works and what he is suppose to be doing
0385495323|5.0|A very good introduction to the field in a concise book. Some codes are not well explained, due to the book size.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I downloaded this game expecting. to delete it quickly. I am surprised by how much fun it is! Kids will like it, too.
B00AEFY66U|2.0|I was really disappointed in this movie.  I remember seeing it when it first came out, and I thought I liked it, but I was wrong.  I know it's supposed to be about the vapid lifestyle of the rich at the time, and it succeeds too well in its portrayal.  I felt like I wasted my time watching it, not to mention my money on the purchase.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|unloved this game. it is like 3 different games in one! it is like something I haven't seen done before. and I really like it.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I really like how you can style, dye. wash, and dress up their hair. The only one complaint that I have is that their should be more options with the characters.
B009YBU8CQ|5.0|Adichi is such a fine writer and Purple Hibiscus takes the reader on a brilliant journey.<br />For me,  a good book is one that I do not want to put down.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|The music and acting can only be matched by a live performance I last seen in Toronto years ago.  The story line is of true love.
B00CRW2066|5.0|I listen to this all the time in my car. Great cd. Can't wait for more from them in the future.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I rarely buy music but this CD is well worth the price.  My husband normally won't listen to CW in the car, but he enjoys this one.  I was surprised that I also am able to download the mp3 version at no additional cost.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|It is a wonderful tale and a review cannot do it justice. It is the type of story that you think about when you are not reading and you simply cannot wait to resume. His words enveloped me, overwhelmed me and held my attention from the first word to the last...and beyond.  I did not want it to end.
140006922X|1.0|If you are truly questioning the Divinity of Jesus, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.<br /><br />I highly recommend Lee Strobel  \\"The Case for Christ\\", Lee Strobel traces his path from Atheism to true Christianity.  This book also nicely explains and unravels \\"Q\\" with many citations.<br />Also of note by atheists who trace their path to belief:<br />\\"The Everlasting Man\\" by G.K Chesterton.<br />\\"Orthodoxy\\", by G.K Chesterton.<br />\\"Mere Christianity\\" by C.S. Lewis.<br />\\"Greater Works\\" by Smith Wigglesworth for modern proof of Jesus Divinity.
B005LMEB8E|4.0|She really is pretty talented and great to listen to. I enjoy her music. Very talented. girl and very entertaining.
B001RMYWG8|4.0|Enjoyed this movie about Frank Serpico.  Was a little slow in some places but overall gave a good account of the corruption in the New York police dept.
B000SCHBGQ|3.0|I was expecting more. I still havent finished the book, but the writing seems a little predictable and unoriginal. Subject matter is pretty interesting, but its presentation of it is a bit trite. I would say it'd be a 4star for young adults..
B00499NHLC|5.0|Sherlock stirs the intellect!  The series always challenges your mind,  and leaves you wishing each episode lasted just a little longer.
B00DE0RQM8|4.0|Cute song for a kids movie. Pretty catchy. I really can't hate it and I have to admit that I like singing along to it.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Slow moving at first with a ton of names and historical data. But BAM when it gets going after a couple of chapters it was almost impossible to put down! Action packed and well written. Def for mature readers only due to violence. Was very bereft when I finished them because I wanted it to keep going it was so good!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The game is definitely fun, but it seems like it is quickly going in the direction of not staying free. You can only collect a small amount of credits in a 24 hour period..which doesn't seem fair.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Really enjoy this game, have been playing it for months and still love it. Plenty of levels to complete and lots of lovely people who play that will help you along the way with gifts.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It was pretty funny to read this book and feel like I had read something from the author before. To realize that it was the same Cassandra Clare who wrote the Draco Dormiens trilogy was awesome. Love seeing some of my favorited fanfiction writers succeed.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|An insight into history as we never see it.  A valuable portrait of men as they really are in the role of leadership.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I stumbled accross this book on the bargain table at the local bookstore and the premise seemed interesting. Like some other readers, I was put off at first by having a 5 year old narrate but I quickly got beyond that and was immediately drawn in. I couldn't put it down but I was sad when it was finished. I found myself thinking about the world from Jack's perspective and how scary the world must have been for him. There were times when I was frustrated with some of the characters who just couldn't seem to grasp that.  A great, fast read, I highly recommend it. I am sharing my copy with my co-workers.
B0014DW3OS|5.0|Great movie!! Denzel Washington personifies what a great actor is. Well deserving of the Oscar nomination and award. A truly awesome movie from start to finish.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The Flow Free game is very challenging and addictive. One must rely on critical thinking to form the best strategy. The more spaces used for each colored line will result in a higher score.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I have always loved the matrix so I am biased it has one of the best plots of any show ever and this set does not disappoint, worth every cent. But it is cheaper from the UK and gets delivered much quicker. I prefer not to buy from Canada or the US for these two reasons but this time I could not avoid it as the item was not in stock in the UK.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This is one of my favorites of her works. Jodi Picoult can take a difficult topic and weave a tale of sorrow and joy in one spin. I couldn't put this book down.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|This app connects my android, gmail calendars, and pops up on my kindle fire, too! You only have to update or enter in one place, and they all update automatically...super user-friendly &amp; convenient for tasks or for work &quot;To-Do&quot; lists. Recommend!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|So neat. Love it.<br />Beautiful pictures.<br />Needs better sound in back ground.<br />Spellbinding.<br />Can't wait for next set of puzzles.
B008JEJNCK|5.0|It is advertised as extra roomie.  I had to go down a size number to get a really good slightly roomy fit.  They feel great!  I love it! Soft and grippy.  Just received it.  Have yet to test durability but I'm sure it's great.
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|Heard so many people talk about this show and have only watch two episodes but am now hooked.  I will definitely get caught up in no time.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|a lot of ppl bashed this almost straight out of the gate.  I will admit I would like the graphics to be sharper.  But, the complaints about some of the colors being too close is interesting. I think it's part of the challenge, makes you have to pay closer attention to what you're doing.  I would think, though, it might be a problem for those who are color-blind to some degree.<br /><br />For me - I thoroughly enjoy.  I agree with another user that it would be cool if the blocks flipped all ways.  And, again, if the graphics were a bit sharper.<br /><br />But, it's a keeper for me.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|A book that you can't put down, the best of the first three Fire and Ice.  Martin is a masterful writer that keeps you guessing at every turn.
B0012NO4WO|5.0|This is definitely an edge of your seat movie.  Keanu Reeves, besides being wonderful to look at, does a fine job in his role. The suspense is thrilling.  Just a great action movie!!
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Works great with my laptop. Easy to send photos almost anywhere. I have my photos on every device in the house.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|The directors twist gives credence to a theory that the pyramids were not constructed from anyone from this planet. The story line was easy to follow and full of surprises.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|Iron Man 3 only works slightly when its making fun of itself.  From the revelation about The Mandarin to a wise cracking little boy side character, the film uses self referential irony to try to make up for its cliched ideas.  Out for the most part it relies on one unimaginative CGI action sequence after another, and the wink and nod aren't enough to redeem such tired archetypes.  This is the movie that makes one wonder if they'll ever stop making super hero movies.  Unless you really like Robert Downy Jr, I wouldn't bother with it.
B004MC0FO8|3.0|IT SOMETIMES TAKES A WHILE TO IDENTIFY SONG BUT USUALLY DOES. Z LITTLE SLOW ON THE UPTAKE BUT GETS THERE.
0062255657|5.0|Astonishing and very powerful book. Also, terrifying, just terrifying. The monsters and dreadful cruelties that a child encounters and must deal with. In this case, the child has the magical aid of the women of the neighboring farm, a magical place which is much more than it seems. The women too are mysterious and powerful, and are pleasingly set into the ancient pattern of crone, matron, and maiden. I haven't read all the other reviews, but surely someone else noted that the youngest member of the trinity dies to save the boy--another beautiful story, which is very familiar to us. And, how charming, the often repeated mantra that the girl is not dead, but in Australia, just visiting Australia. Australia--or, for that matter, Valhalla, Mount Olympus--far away places where people go and don't return.<br />The whole sad business of losing your childhood, and of forgetting the magic and wonder of those times is one that radiates through so many of my favorite childhood books, as it does in this one. An excellent book, and it should send you on to reading Mr. Gaiman's other books--all excellent. Let me urge my particular favorite, Stardust. Well, also, Coraline, Neverwhere, American Gods. All good, all fun to read!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is truly the future of Celtic fiddle playing. This young lady not only plays a hot fiddle, she commands your attention. Lindsey Stirling will change the way you listen to fiddle players.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I was so happy to see this as one of the Gold Box deals. I loved all these movies and the addition of the Animatrix is a great plus. As a set of Blu-Ray movies, this is a nice set as it includes special additional footage for each film like a making of and deleted scenes. This is a must have for an lover of the Matrix universe.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Every single song on the CD is brilliant.  I have recently bought music where only one song was worth listening to...not so on this CD, every single song is great. Blake Shelton really put a lot of love in each song. Can't stop listening to it.
0425266060|4.0|Enjoyed the books, look forward to the next book that comes out in this set which I am sure there will be.
B008I74JLS|5.0|This is absolutely the only TV series I have ever purchased.  Bought it because I was an avid fan of the show, so no surprises. If you like the American version of Being Human, you will love this version. Specially the characters Annie and Mitchell.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Dark, thoughtful, sound storyline of a character that could easily live among us which makes the thrill so much more interesting.  There are a few minor tendencies of this author that I had to learn to overlook such as using strange, nonsensical nicknames to some of the main characters which, in my opinion, took away from the storyline as I deemed it as very distrating.  An example of this, and by far the most prevalent was the use of &#34;Angel Batista-no-relation&#34; whenever referring to this particular character.  Can anyone explain to me WHY???????<br /><br />Besides this one annoying feature, I truly love this series and there is enough differences between the books and the show that it manages to keep my interest up.  Love this writer!  I hope his work will continue even though the tv series is wrapping up.  I believe there is still a lot of good that Dexter can be doing for his beloved Miami and I really want the opportunity to watch over his shoulder.
B005544V6A|5.0|I definitely recommend this show. Funny and smart. I was looking for a new show to follow and suddenly I found myself addicted to it.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The Brits do police procedurals like no one else. The hunt for the killer(s) is intertwined with the lives of the people in the small village. David Tennant is a new to the area Scot who is in charge of investigating the death of a young boy. Of course, no one is who everyone thinks and everyone has a secret. Tennant is tortured by some event that has yet to be divulged but is hinted to be involving a prior murder inquiry.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I have a lot of the Angry Birds APPS. They are so much fun! When you get all the pigs, monkeys or birds and get the three stars you can hear a hoot from me.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|It's a classic! Hepburn, Grant, Stewart. The perfect cast.<br />Why do I need eleven more words? I've said all that's needed.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|ADULTS will love it too!<br /><br />The movie is based on the fabled tale of Rapunzel. It's great to see a modern version of the tale. It's wholesome, clean and great for the entire family. As with other Disney movies, they strive to reach audiences of all ages. There are some quirky comments that the adults will understand that makes the movie enjoyable at all ages. The cinematography and creativeness is great and it looks marvelous on stream and bluray. I couldn't tell the difference.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Very compelling. It is a great story but I feel like I need to read it again to understand  all the symbolism.
B001ISMH90|5.0|The book shows you looking from the west to the east. The Indian history of the American west.<br />A history of the American West from the Indian point of view.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I say &#34;now&#34; because when it arrived the goofy elastic strap on the INSIDE rubbed the screen and left marks. I removed that and still found marks (not as bad as before I removed the wide strap) on my screen. I now use a piece of soft material to cover my screen when the case is closed  and have had no further marks. I have not been able to understand why an elastic strap would be inside the case!<br />Other than the above, this case works as described. It rotates easily, holds itself up well, and can be adjusted. If the elastic strap which holds it together fails I will likely replace it myself. However, should the whole case wear out I will buy another one. And hope the goofy wide elastic strap on the INSIDE has been eliminated.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Season 7 is great! I can't wait to watch season 8. It is so easy to order through Amazon movies.
B00BQXLG1C|3.0|This is a great program and it seems well designed. That's the only reason I threw down ten dollars on the thing. There are a variety of topics and it was great for my ESL students.<br /><br />That said, one of the games does not work (as mentioned by the first reviewer.) Why on Earth did I pay so much and then get a game that 1. doesn't work and 2. has not been fixed to date? I feel a little silly. This was a rather expensive purchase thinking of how much I typically pay for apps, but I really enjoyed the free preview and expected the same quality in the other games. The topics are great, the games are enjoyable, but man...that one glitchy game.<br /><br />If that doesn't bother you, go ahead and buy it.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|it was an interesting twist to a very unusual situation. This is not must read , but I was very intrigued from the 1 st page.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I did not watch this series on tv but heard good things about it . It was easier to buy then find it to rent .. Loved the first season had to go out and buy the second season right after watching waiting for the third season to be released to catch up in time for the 4th season to begin
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is really fun to play. It goes by really fast and get power ups quickly. Even though some of the puzzles repeat, they switch up each time as to add an extra challenge. Worth the buy!
B000JCSPG0|2.0|the movie is pretty goofy, and i can forgive it that. it is fun and sci-fi goodness. but OH MY GOSH! Ra? seriously? i am sorry but i have a hard time buying anyone being freaked out by the actor who plays Ra. he just is not scary/ all powerful looking. not that Ra needs to be played by &#34;The Rock&#34; or something, but having a &#34;creepy&#34; voice and magic power gloves just did not make me think he could enslave thousands.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app consistently freezes or refuses to open altogether.  I have it installed on multiple devices, and often,  I can't get the app to open on any of them.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This is a great first single. Looking forward to see what the rest of Gaga's new album will sound like.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|By Book Three the sex got a little tedious.  I did like the ending even though it was far fetched.
1848503350|5.0|just superb, clear and fully understandable. It gave  me insights not found anywhere else up to now. One must read it twice - at least some chapters - to fully grasp what he wants to say.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|When I first read this two years ago, I had only read Brandon's collaborate with the late Robert Jordan.  I had been impressed with that book, but felt like it wouldn't be fair to judge the new young author on something that wasn't his own creation.  I picked this one up, because it was recommended by Amazon and the price was right for my first digital book.  I have yet to be disappointed by anything I have read by him since.<br /><br />This is a long book.  Not only is it a long book, but it is the first long book in a very long series of what promise to be long books.  I think Mr. Sanderson has said he expects there to be ten.  It is a commitment not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />The book doesn't feel too longish however.  Yes there were a couple of times where I found myself checking to see how much farther I might have to go, and one or two times that I found myself skipping ahead a little bit.  These were usually during the Shallan chapters as this was the character whom I thought was the least developed.<br /><br />The world building and the complexity of it is absolutely wonderful.  The environment and biology of the world are firmly ground in Darwinian principles making them a product of the the world the live in, not the other way around.  For example, because of the great storms that are part of the climatology of the planet, much of the animal life have shells that they are able to retreat into to protect themselves.  Brandon even takes this one step further technologically by indicating that the advancement in and magic surrounding some of the weapons and armor is a result of the need to be able to have weapons that can penetrate these shells.<br /><br />The story and characterizations are fantastic with the exception of Shallan, whom I suspect just got the short end of the stick this time around.  Kaladin's and the bridgmen's story is terrifically woven into Dalinar's story with just enough hints to the audience that they don't feel like the connection made at the end of the story comes completely out of left field.  You feel for both of these characters and understand each point of view with perfect clarity.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Awesome game. They keep me waiting for my new bonuses. I play other bingos too,, but this one,, by far is my favorite
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought that this was the best of the trilogy because it introduced the characters.  Also, it was one of the first erotic books that I've read that had a plot.
B004FOOQV6|5.0|I am amazed at how fast calculations are made. Makes converting very simple. I recommend it for everyone that might be going to Europe.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|This was an unexpected surprise.  I really enjoyed watching their relationship change and grow along their way across the country.  It was good to see Barbra Streisand is still a great actress.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is a great item and I am very happy with the fast service. I could not have asked for anything to be handles better. thanks
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book two was a more in depth look at Ana and Grey.  I wished it had explored the other characters a little more.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is my favorite of the bingo games I play. I Look forward to playing this game to relax before going to bed. The graphics and sounds are of great quality. There are many rooms and levels to work my way through. It is also fun to chat with other players and help each other along. I recommend this Bingo Blitz to anyone.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|Honesty in that profession is refreshing, but you also pay a very high price for your honesty. He can be referred to a modern day whistle blower
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is a great item and I am very happy with the fast service. I could not have asked for anything to be handles better. thanks
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I have followed this band ever since they came out in my 8th grade year, I can't stop listening. By far, my favorite album of the 3
B0091CWYQ6|1.0|Was excited to receive this in the mail.  But the unit will not take a charge.  AT ALL!!!  I left it hooked up to my computer for the recommended 90 minutes.  As soon as I disconnected it, and turned the unit's switch to ON..... NOTHING!!! nada....  So, I hooked it back up to the USB port (which, by the way, I confirmed that it is working, as it charged my USB Bluetooth headphones with no problem).  This time, I left the unit \\"charging\\" overnight.  Still..... THE UNIT WILL NOT TURN ON. While the unit is hooked up to the USB port, it flashes a red light continuously.  Whatever that means.....<br /><br />The instructions that come with the unit are not very good at all.  And they are written in such small writing, that I literally had to use a magnifying glass, so that I could easily read them.  Many, mis-spellings, and gramatical errors.  I understand that this is a Chinese company..... but Really??  They can't afford to hire a \\"fluent\\" English translator to write their operating instructions?<br /><br />Also, the web site is pretty much a joke too.  Just go there and explore it.  If you dig deep enough, you will get quite a chuckle out of some of the \\"English\\" instructions and suggestions.<br /><br />I wanted to like this.  And in fact, I will update my rating, IF THE VENDOR RESPONDS TO ME AND SENDS ME ANOTHER UNIT SO THAT I CAN PROPERLY REVIEW IT.  I e-mailed the vendor and told them of the problem, and have not heard from them yet.  So I thought I would go ahead and post this review and see if the company has anybody watching the ratings.  Maybe that will get a quicker response.  We'll see.  If I don't hear back from them soon, I will just send it back to Amazon. and let my one star rating stand. I should have just done that in the first place, but wanted to see if the vendor would respond and give me some 'trick\\" or \\"procedure\\" to correct the \\"non charge\\" - that may not be in the instructions or on the web site. I'll keep you posted.....<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />It has been several days now, and I have not heard anything back from this company.  I e-mailed them and I also<br />posted a message on their facebook site and did not get a response from them.  So, I just got through going<br />through Amazon's return/refund procedure.  This will be the first item that I've ever had to return anything to Amazon.  And so far, Amazon's procedure for this has been simple, streamlined and easy to navigate.  And all of the rave reviews that buyers post about Amazon's return policy and the way Amazon deals with these issues quickly, makes me believe that I will receive a refund. (I was not given the option of a replacement for this item) So, once I receive the refund, I will have to decide if I want to roll the dice again and re-order this device, and hope that I receive a \\"working\\" unit. From the other review on here and from the item's description, I think i would like the device, \\"IF IT WOULD TAKE A CHARGE AND FUNCTION PROPERLY.\\"  But for now, I have to<br />let the one star rating stand, as I think the company should have at least responded to my messages.
B00DHNBY02|3.0|I was hoping this movie would be scarier than it was, but it was more cheesy. A lot of unrealistic looking deaths and dismemberments. Some parts were cool, but the previews made it look better than it actually was.
B000FC1192|5.0|This book is AMAZING!It is so unique and different and creepy and the best thing is is that........IT'S FOR KIDS!!
B00B89WXYS|5.0|OneRepublic is taking leaps and bounds evolving their music style to more perfect off of the &#34;Waking Up&#34; album turn of upbeat music while still maintaining some songs with the smooth majesty of the first album.
B0034G4ORM|4.0|OUTSTANDING AQ & PQ.  Great alien invasion story from the ground level soldier's perspective.  Way more fun than you'd think it would be.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Not too hard, just right!  I like it so far as I've played.  I love free games that actually work!
014312093X|5.0|Le Carre produced another great  story.  The plot was extremely complex, with a plenty of plot twists.  I think I have now read all of Le Carre&#34;s spy books.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|Waking up was such a great turn from their previous album, for the better as well. They really put the art into all their albums especially &#34;Waking Up&#34; and &#34;Native&#34;, but their alteration from verse chorus verse chorus bridge chorus is very pleasing, it really brings the art back into music. Definitely some beautiful poetry from these songs
B0057R5XRG|4.0|What can I say?  Excellent PQ & AQ.  These classic films have NEVER looked or sounded this good.  Enjoy the films!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had to read this again in preparation to the movie coming up.  It is such a great book and so easy to read.  Even though I had read it once before it was hard to put down.  Great book I highly recommend it.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|I didnt love this, but I really liked it. It is entertaining for adults & kids alike. There are quite a few funny parts that keep you engaged in the movie. But Im hoping Despicable Me 2 is even better.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|A call to reality from a place of love and joy--acknowledging the failures and rough patches, while always looking up with hope. Good stuff. Very good stuff.<br /><br />Joel Orr<br />JoelTrainsAuthors.com
B004XQO8VO|4.0|Great PQ & AQ.  A must for Stallone and Snipes fans.  A great romp through the classic good guy vs bad guy.
B000BCE918|5.0|This movie pack about the Jurassic era grows on you as you get into it.  The Grand kids got me started and I have been hooked ever since.<br />These are truly good movies full of action packed drama and the dinos are so real, you would think you are right there!!!<br />Great for the kids, the older ones that is, the younger ones may be traumatized by these movies.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife is a must for all outdoors men. It did everything I needed it too and its built to last.very happy!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well written mystery.  Characters are so real I could identity with all of them even if they were complicated if not fatally flawed.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I loved this story especially because it's true. It's a great thing James is doing, trying to make people aware of the homeless people and animals. I hope everyone who reads this book learns this lesson. It's probably one of the best books I've ever read. It was recommended to me by a fellow writer and I have talked it up to other people too.<br /><br />What a wonderful animal and owner! I wish only good things for both of them and I know God is looking down on them and smiling.<br /><br />Cathy Carlson
B001GZ6QBU|3.0|Changing the actress who played his love interest was my first pet peeve. Although Heath Ledger did a fine job as Joker, his part was overdone, especially in how he was able to quickly rig explosives around the entire city. I also wonder why there was so little development on him when he was the major attraction.<br /><br />Harvey Dent was portrayed quite well, but almost exclusively in the beginning. His personal loss was tragic but well-conceived. His physical loss due to the prior event was unrealistic. The turnaround thereafter was overdone, and it seemed strictly for drama.<br /><br />Overall, I think one needs to watch this just to connect the first and third, but this middle piece was a weak link.
B00AEUU4LQ|3.0|I purchased this book expecting to enjoy is as much as Hosseini's previous two books, but I did not find this book as good as the other two I read (&#34;The kite runner&#34; and &#34;A thousand splended suns&#34;).<br /><br />The reason is that the story moves too much back-and-forth for my taste, leading to a constant loss of the trail and emotions built up by the previous chapter. Also, too many characters and loosely connected stories dilute the experience in the end.
1623420148|3.0|I do not like 1st person present.  In fact I would be happy if I never read another 1st person book again.  But it was effective at showing everything going through this guy's mind.  It's educational about how a lot of guys' minds work.  This might be valuable for women who are dating.  It makes me wary.<br /><br />Here's an excerpt to give you a flavor of the book and Drew's thought process.<br /><br />\\"The thing women don't understand is that a guy can want one woman and still f*** another one.  Hell, a guy could love a woman and still f*** ten others.  It's just the way it is...  Maybe you'll understand my point of view if I put it this way.  You brush your teeth, right?  Well, suppose your favorite toothpaste is Aquafresh.  But the store is out.  All they have is Colgate.  What are you going to do?  You're going to use the Colgate, right?\\"<br /><br />The story: Drew picks up women in bars for one-night stands.  He calls them baby or sweetheart so he doesn't accidentally use the wrong name.  Kate is the new hire at his company and he wants her.  She is engaged to someone else.  The rest is romance novel formula: they get together, have a huge fight, and then happy together at the end.  (This is a romance novel, so I'm not giving anything away.)<br /><br />The fight was based on a stupid inaccurate assumption - see Spoiler.<br /><br />CAUTION SPOILER:<br />Kate enters Drew's office to tell him something, two sentences.  After the first sentence, Drew immediately assumes she's going to break up with him, so he wants to strike first and hurt her.  He tells her a lie and that she means nothing to him.  If he would have waited for her second sentence he would have known she was not breaking up with him.<br />END SPOILER<br /><br />So now we have this big separation, and he's grieving for the next chunk of the book.  I was angry.  I don't like contrived reasons.<br /><br />It was fun for sex, and I liked watching Drew grovel and apologize.<br /><br />The f word is used a lot.<br /><br />Author made some grammar errors (I vs me).<br /><br />DATA:<br />Narrative mode: 1st person present Drew.

B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love uno it's a fun game..the only problem with this one is waiting for slow players to hurry up and take they turn other than that it's a blast.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Great! Love this series. And it's even better given that it is a spin off of Dr. Who. Go BBC!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is fun choosing a name for your town and I love that you decide how to spend your money. The goals make it exciting and fun. I highly recommend this game.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I loved this book. I actually read it because my friends told me it was terrible.<br /><br />It was not.<br /><br />I was not impressed with Card's writing, but the way he wove Ender's psyche into the plot was great and very inspiring to me as a writer.<br /><br />Last little comment: Ender's name bothered me the whole time. It sounded quite... Over egotistical. It wasn't my style, but to each his own.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who likes science fiction and to anyone who likes battles/video games.<br />If you liked Ender's Game, I would recommend reading Insignia.
067101756X|5.0|This book is so interesting that this is about the fourth copy I have purchased over the last 9 years or so.  I wanted to keep two for myself and gave the other ones to friends.  It is one you want to keep.  Very full of info.  I have read it myself at least three times and learn something new every time.
B008602KQI|4.0|We thought this was a fairly good movie.  While the book provides much more storyline, we think the movie fairly captures the essence but certainly leaves out quite a bit of the fine details about the characters and their relationships.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I've been a fan of the X-Men since I collected the comic books back in the day.  As for the movies, they have been hit or miss IMO.  This one, despite how it differs in places from \\"core\\" (as though Marvel hasn't played with this series in countless ways over the years).  It was great to go back in time and see the beginning of things.<br /><br />X-Men First Class is set in the 1960s, which is another kick...the clothes, the hair, the cars!  OMG!  We also get to see Charles Xavier and Magneto as younger men and why Magneto is as he is, the horrors he went through as a child during the time of WW2.  It makes his eventual actions all the more understandable.  This is very much a movie about the two of them, highlighting their deep bond...which makes the inevitable split on their beliefs about the future of mutantkind all the more poignant.  You can definitely see why he chose his path and why Charles fought to keep him from going down that path.<br /><br />There are some familiar mutants in this movie and some ones less well known.  Seeing our favorite blue shape-shifter as a young girl is wonderful and I really enjoyed how she met Charles and how their relationship evolved.<br /><br />The final battle scenes playing off against the Cuban Missile crisis is brilliant, absolutely brilliant.  The special effects are great.  The characters are finely drawn.  The actors chosen for them are perfect.  This has to be one of the best X-Men movies...even if my sweetie, Wolverine, isn't one of the main characters this time around.<br /><br />I saw this in the theatre and have watched it multiple times on my Blu-Ray.  If you are a genuine fan of the X-Men, you can't miss this one!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is like the best literally. I love it. Its so addicting and fun way better than temple run ever was
B002SF9YUM|2.0|This artistic little endeavor seems to emulate the writing style of Federico Garcia Lorca, the Spanish martyr/poet/playwright, with lingering artistic shots of waving foliage, drops of rain, flowering plants, etc., etc... The story itself explores the young adult lives of Señor Lorca (June, 1898 - August, 1936), eccentric Surrealist artist/playwright Salvador Dali (May, 1904 - January, 1989) and Luis Buñuel (February, 1900 - July, 1983), the Spanish-born father of cinematic Surrealism. The three of them attended a Madrid college together in 1922. This movie is based on interviews with Dali near the end of his life.<br /><br />We watch the three of them become friends; Lorca, appealingly played by Javier Beltran (\\"El paso\\") and Buñuel, capably portrayed by Matthew McNulty (\\"The Mark of Cain\\" and LOTS of TV) are already chums when Dali, played by Robert Pattinson (\\"Twilight\\"), arrives, insecure but ambitious. All three of them assiduously date women, because homosexuality is illegal in Spain, as it is throughout the Western world at that time, but only Buñuel is actually heterosexual. Of the other two, Dali seems to be bisexual, while Lorca plays (pretty much) for the other team.<br /><br />We are subjected to numerous scenes of collegiate carousing which seem to be universal, whether in Cambridge or Madrid, and the Seattle audience applauded Dali's outspoken nonconformity. One of the actresses did a splendid job as the woman who was in (unrequited) love with Lorca, and I witnessed more of the history of the Spanish revolution than I really sought; but tragically, this movie didn't \\"grab\\" me. Many in the audience found it moving and informative, so I suspect I was in the minority.<br /><br />It's clear to me that Pattinson is striving to avoid typecasting which could threaten his career due to his more recent starring role in the \\"tween\\" vampire franchise (he also appears in the \\"Harry Potter\\" series). He plays the eccentric artiste Dali very well, but unfortunately, his early variations of the characteristic Dali'esque moustache look glued on. I know, I know, that's pretty picky...<br /><br />This screenplay is in English, although Lorca's poems are spoken in Spanish with an English voiceover layered into the soundtrack. Get your DVD from Amazon and make up your own mind.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Very good game. Wish there was one time fee though. Money spent can add up, keep track. $3.00 here $5.00 there can get out of hand. Had to swear it off, no joke
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a classic funny movie,  I had seen it when it came out years ogo and it's still funny now.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I saw this inadvertantly on HBO around 1987, so I was suprised when I learned that it was a Miyazaki movie. I've always liked animation as I grew up with some pretty cool cartoons and such but movies like this really made me take anime a bit more seriously. Its not a total kiddie Miyazaki flick (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) but this is more my style: post-apocalyptic, giant mutated creatures, weird ass sound effects, solid storytelling, and a score that exudes emotion. This anime makes me feel like I've gone to another world. And typical Japanese Anime critter-buddy Teto is awesome.
B00BUL0XYG|4.0|if you like The Strokes, then you will like/love this album.  Excellent musicianship recorded on this album.. Keep it up
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|I could not put this book down. I had to keep reading and have purchased the other books in the series. I defiantly recommend this book!
B0050AV5MW|3.0|This is starting to get dangerously like a Wheel of Time - takes thousands of pages and chapters just to get from A to B
0823015017|5.0|I have enjoyed reading and working with this book. I have learned many new tricks and techniques. Excellent response time and just what I ordered.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|I really enjoyed both this book and the first book as well.  They are well written with a good plot.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|At first I thought it was ridiculous because of the concept... a kid practicing law without a license. However, after watching the show for 3 seasons now I am an addict. The writing is smart, the characters dynamic, and overall it is lots of fun.
B004XISI4A|3.0|One has got to start to wonder whether this is simply going to drag on and on without much actually being said. I hope it doesn't turn out to be another Wheel of Time
B00CXVX1OQ|2.0|Graphics are average, Not bad but not impressive either. Game play is incredibly simple and absolutely no challenge at all, Which sort of sucks. All you to do is spam the punch button and you are perfectly fine. Customization options are rather limited and I think they'd really benefit by having more unlocked at the start of the game and allowing you to unlock more as you progress through the game.<br /><br />That being said, This app is not worth 3 dollars. Heck, It's not even worth 1 dollar. It should be a free app. As for why - It gets real boring, Real fast. The slight entertainment I had when I first started playing quickly faded 10-15 mins later because there is no real fun to be had in this app. Do not bother with it, It's not worth buying.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Complete information placed in as well a context as can be expected. Unbiased interpretation of available evidence without steering the conversation to any particular persuasion. I thought the information revealed and shared was dynamite.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|We used this pool for entertainment on a family vacation.  We had several children ranging in age 6 month - 7 years all playing in the pool and it held up great!  A little something for everyone!  The fountains around the edge are a great feature too!<br /><br />The neighbor at our vacation home loved it so much he bought it from us, so we'll be ordering a new one for the house soon!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Not really great to play by yourself against the computer, pretty boring actually. But if you've got others to play with then uno is always fun
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I am looking forward to more on Teddy.  My sixteen year old grand daughter loves it too.  Grisham keeps intriguing.
B001G70M6S|5.0|I picked up an old Polaroid 104 Land Camera at a Goodwill store for $5.  The camera had an original empty Polaroid film pack and original battery, (I think.)  I replaced the battery and put in a new pack of film and the results were great.  This film has great contrast and best of all, unlike the old Polaroid film, this is non-terminating film.  Meaning that once you expose the film, pull it out of the camera and leave it longer than the recommended time, it won't ruin the film.  It'll just develop to a great contrasty photo.  I've found waiting around 30 seconds, (twice the recommended time) will give you the best results.<br /><br />I love how this film looks and the negatives can be kept and scanned later.  Be sure to let the developer on the negatives dry sufficiently before scanning or handling.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this free bingo game..wish you earned more bingo for your wins..keeps you waiting to collect each day to play again ..dont like that,...but best bingo game out there with no blips..please try to update more bingo wins for us, cards are to expensive going to next levels, hate waiting for next day to play
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've never had any probs using it on my kindle fire hd. Never stopped responding, always loads fast. A great free app
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I love &#34;Teddy&#34; and the way his mind works.  Great Grisham character that I know I will follow enthusiastically !
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Was amazed at the authenticity of settings, costumes,speech patterns, etc.  The historical Viking era has been a passion of mine for a lifetime (I am 70); I have read the Eddas and whatever literature of the period that I could get my hands on (the 42nd St. library is a great source).  I learned from this series, especially aspects of the religion eg. knew about human sacrifice, but not how it was done.  Loved the character of Ragnar's wife as portrayed! You want to know how the story plays out.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing bingo if I could I'd play it at work and not get in trouble lol it's also a good way for kids to find their numbers and a lesson that you don't always win!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I finished all of the 10 levels in about 30 mins. Kind of wish it was a little more complicated or at least more levels.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|This movie was great. It has a little of everything and keeps you on edge. The ending is crazy. With the exception of 1 scene I think this movie is appropriate for ages 14 and up.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Fine way to spend an evening; great fun.  Don't expect great theater, of course.  This is pure, mindless action.  Comic book with real actors.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|overall a great watch. Fun movie to watch with a group of freinds. Many famous actor appearances as well. ha
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Works great on the kindle fire...minus the in game ads of course. But with the variety of angry birds themes, it never gets old.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really loved this book. Katniss did what she had to. I kept heating people say they didn't under why she did what she did but, I enjoyed it! :)
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Super CD from a super artist.  We &#60;3 Garth any time, any where.  GR8 to jog or workout with this music, the time flies by.<br />Long live Garth.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Addictive, I love it and my kids too! Only time I get to play it alone is when they're sleeping
B00DQR26EC|5.0|Fun, old-school style rpg. I would recommend getting this game. Especially for only two bucks! Can't wait for the sequel.

0767919408|5.0|I discovered Bryson many years ago right after \\"the Lost Continent\\" came out. I have read most all of his books and enjoyed them all and even have seen mellow a bit over the years. In my mind this is the most enjoyable Bryson book since \\"In a sunburned country\\". Bill writing about the wonderful year of 1927 when anything could and did happen is a match made in heaven. I am not going to rehash what others have already said, I will say though I enjoy his travel narratives the best, I look forward to learning more history via the Bryson way.<br /><br />P.S.--Bill if you are reading this, please reconsider and Do Canada! I am dying to read that one.

0425252868|5.0|It has been a long time since I picked up a book to read, then couldn't put it down! The writer deserves a lot of accolades for this!!!!!!! More importantly, to the pilots! This is one of those human interest stories that just has to be told (and read). This would make one of the greatest movies ever made! The sad part is, there aren't any present actors that have the ability to do it. The so-called &#34;actors&#34; of today do not possess the talent to make it a great movie. These pilots deserve someone better than the actors we have! In closing, it is a must read book; and, being a &#34;guy&#34; it is hard to state that the ending had me teary eyed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is absolutely fantastic. I love it. It definitely had my brain thinking. My kids even got into it which is a blessing. And they actually got it pretty fast.
B00CTSVE3S|5.0|From my value perspective, there are no flaws in this film.  It's a perfect film; the most important film of the nineties.<br /><br />While listening to Maria Callas' moving version of \\"La Mamma Morta\\" from Giordano's \\"Andre Chenier,\\" Tom Hanks secured his winning grasp on the Oscar (1994) by virtue of his impassioned \\"voice-over\\" to the aria's glorious depiction of the triumphant power of love.<br /><br />I'd hoped to enhance my viewing experience with the new blu-ray version, but unfortunately the BD adds nothing to the video or audio quality of my old dvd [\\"Deluxe Widesceen Presentation\\" (1997)].  The new blu-ray is also relatively expensive, and its picture is noticeably darker.  I will end up giving the BD away, and keeping my dvd.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|What can you say about Maggie Smith and the other actors except that you KNOW<br />the movie will be well worth watching.....more than once.  An unusual theme with a<br />delightful turn.

B009WUBERW|4.0|We decided to pick an action movie and this was on the list.  Very predictable with a lot of explosions. The bright spots were a couple new faces to offset the aging heroes.  So many cliche' lines from all the other movies. But I had to give this movie 2 extra stars for the man who can make a king cobra suffer! ;-)

The love story between the Doctor and his companion was so well done and believable, and the music played during  the series 2 finale was perfect and heartfelt.  The Doctor's Theme is also a highlight in the whole series. This show really has some of the best music in anything. Must buy if you're a big fan.
B00354Y9ZU|5.0|I'd love to say that this was GOOD, but I'd be lying. This was REMARKABLE. Why? Because anybody that strives to be more than just a cog in someone's machine, would be well served to read this. The concepts are are so well articulated, it seems foolish to ignore obvious truths - the industrial revolution packed it's bags, moved to China and left a lot a vacancy currently being occupied by people scratching their heads wondering where do they go from here. The beautiful thing, so well said by Seth, is that this is exactly where we can shine. Anybody willing to risk being a LinchPin has the greatest chance of success in today post industrial revolution. I've listened to this book 3 times now on my daily morning walks, and every time I put the headphones on, my mind races with potentiality. Seth is the ultimate cheerleader, if I can say that, for the creative mind. ART is back, and Seth provides the canvas. It's up to you to paint a vision of what your contribution to the world will be.<br /><br />effin-REMARKABLE!

B00000DR5I|5.0|Tangerine Dream's \\"Rubicon\\" was released not long after \\"Phaedra\\", a sequencer-driven magnum opus that propelled the group nearly to the top of the charts and firmly established its rightful place among rock icons of the day. This was no minor feat, considering the rock-and-roll scene of the day and the entry of something so psychedelic and unprepared for radio. Like its predecessor, \\"Rubicon\\" is a composition of movements or \\"Parts\\", that continue when the album is (or was) flipped. No short easy numbers, but an enveloping and engrossing piece that is to be attended to with ears wide open. Tangerine Dream's music was thus: explorations in time and space that listeners could get into and enjoy for as long as they wanted to enjoy the trip. \\"Rubicon\\" is among the best of these works, also known as TD's Pink Years, marking not only an important and pivotal time for the group but for the music of the day.
B000000WJ2|5.0|Not a bad track on this CD anywhere, Love the music of the Rolling Stones but Keith and Ronnie own albums are just as much fun to listen to and rock out to.

The title track Total Life Forever sounds very familiar to the Talking Heads rhythmically and vocally. The same goes for Black Gold another one of my favorites. Incrediby solid album start to finish. Highly recommend for fans of Talking Heads, Autolux, Queens of the Stone Age, Dinosaur Jr, Wire, New Order and XTC.
1451695195|5.0|It is beautiful to witness the courage it would take for a scientist to publicly express his discovery of faith. No small feat. For believers, the book is a message of hope. For skeptics, its another object of ridicule. Regardless, it is a gift to a humanity that is struggling under the weight of its own ambitions, greed, and fear in an increasingly uncertain world.
140006922X|5.0|Ripping read bringing to life the socio-economic as well as religious history of the Holyland during its most wretched period: the Roman Occupation of Israel, which overlapped the time of Jesus of Nazareth. Explains many of the discrepancies in the New Testament, the genesis of the Jew-hatred promoted by Paul and the Holy Roman Empire, etc. The author is extremely well educated & takes more the anthropological, rather than religious, view. Although born a Moslem, he was enamored of Christianity as a youth and is married to a Christian, but this book is bound to ruffle some Christian feathers. (I hope there's not going to be a fatwah against him!)

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I took to reading this book in order to preview it for my 11 year old, who has been asking to read it for his personal reading. I had heard of the premise of the story, and it's violence so I was concerned that it would be too intense for his night time reading. I would say it is a bit too graphic for a young mind to take in before sleep, but probably fine for day reading.<br />Personally, I enjoyed the book. I believe it is well written and engaging, the characters are developed and the social-political storyline thought provoking. I look forward to reading the next in the series.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|I  was absolutely  astounded to find that the Superman film series was finally getting a reboot. I went into the theater and I was immediately blown away with every single action-packed moment from the beginning right to the end. And I loved the actors' performance of their respective character in any way possible.<br /><br />So the basic storyline of this Superman movie is the origin story of Superman. And we see Clark Kent/Superman played by Henry Cavill who I thought was the perfect pick for Superman. Other characters include love interest Lois Lane (Amy Adams), father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and villainous General Zod (Michael Shannon). They set the stage for the intended new series of a shared universe of DC that will possibly lean towards the set-up for a Justice League movie (not to be confused with the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise and The Avengers).<br /><br />But the movie was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it. This one is a great movie for fans of comic books, superheroes or science fiction in general. I highly recommend this movie.

0767827902|1.0|The Last Picture Show, 1973 film   Two young men in a pickup truck stop at a pool hall. The radio plays a Hank Williams’ song. The men talk about the local football team. The hard hats suggest workers in oil construction. One young man goes to the local movie theater to meet his girlfriend. Another couple joins them. [That movie poster suggests the late 1940s. That cash register does not have a marble top.] Next day students are in an English class. Then the boys are in a gym. Note the dirt roads of a rural town. [These towns are dependent on the local economy, either in agriculture or minerals.] JC has her own car, unusual in those days. Her Mom talks to JC about love and marriage. Elsewhere a woman gets a ride to the clinic. She comes out sad. [Garages are needed to prevent damage from hail.] She cries when she returns home.   When the parents are away a teenager throws a party. A man dances with his boss’ wife. There is a live band. JC gets a present from her boyfriend; and more. There is a conflict with Dwayne. Later JC goes to that pool party and denudes herself. [Believable in a small town of that era?] The boys pull a prank on Billy, Sam bans them from his pool hall. Dwayne drives that woman again, then comes inside her bedroom. They become friendly. There is another Hank Williams song. Sam and Billy enter the café. The story runs on, recreating small town life circa 1951. But human nature doesn’t change much. There is more change in a person over the decades. Two boys decide on a week-end vacation in Mexico. When they return they learn Sam had a stroke and died! His stores were divided. JC meets a boy in the “Cactus Motel”. [No small town gossip?] Dwayne hesitates. What happened?   People wait outside. “It can’t describe it in words.” Next time its different. JC has a new boyfriend. Dwayne leaves for a job out of town. JC’s new boyfriend married another girl! JC wants to see the pool hall. A man takes her there. They are alone. JC cries when she returns home. There is a report about a missing girl, she is found with an older boy. What happened? JC and her boyfriend go for a ride. Dwayne bought a new Mercury. After JC goes to college her local boyfriends will be dropped. An argument leads to a fight and hospitalization. Dwayne will join the Army.   JC is mean like her grandma. JC marries, her parents are quite upset! The police are notified and find them. [The talk pads out the story.] Football is the big interest; as in other small towns. [Ritualized combat?] They visit the movie theater before it closes down [a movie about cowboys]. Television has taken its audience [or was it the economy?]. [But movie theaters were still a place to take a date.] The soldier leaves town on a bus. His friend will take care of his Mercury. There is an accident on the street! What was he doing? He visits that older woman, she shows her anger. And the story runs down, like a mechanical clock. How much of it seems believable?     This is based on a novel by Larry McMurtry. It attempts to recreate small town life in rural Texas around 1950. This was probably not much different from other small towns across the country. One problem is the presence of television. There is a limit to transmission even in flat lands. The station had to be in a big city about 50 miles away. Religion plays a big role in small town life, yet there is no mention here. This is not so much “bad” as it is “not good”. One advantage is the music: the country & western songs of Hank Williams seldom played in big city areas today.

0743200748|2.0|Comrades<br /><br />Stephen E. Ambrose wrote many books on history. This one is about male friendship, some from the 19th century (from secondary sources). There twelve chapters for this 139 page book; no `Index'. One is about his brothers, another about his father. It is a slight book. This is an interesting book if diffuse in subjects. Its like he wanted to write a family biography but couldn't finish it.<br /><br />Chapter 1 is about his brothers Harry and Bill. They grew up in Whitewater Wisconsin, competing with each other. They played together on high school sport teams. Their father was a doctor in town. They all graduated from college and went separate ways but stayed together. They differed over support of the Vietnam War. Chapter 2 is about the Eisenhower Boys. In those times leaving high school to work was common. Dwight and Milton went to college then worked for the US government and advanced in their careers. Milton helped Dwight politically. Rich men wanted Dwight for President. Milton wrote his speeches. Chapter 3 tells about George Armstrong Custer and his brother Thomas, who served with him in the Civil War. Afterwards they cleared a path for the Northern Pacific Railroad through Indian territory. They died together by the Little Big Horn River.<br /><br />Chapter 4 describes Crazy Horse and He Dog, friends from childhood. When they weren't hunting they fought other tribes. In March 1876 the Army attacked, the Sioux retreated to Crazy Horse's camp and reinforced it. Chapter 5 discusses Eisenhower and Patton. Ike could handle Patton's personality excesses. Ike believed in planning. He was hard working and best-liked. Ike was put in charge of the European theater of operations. He reprimanded Patton after he slapped a sick soldier and was quoted in the press. After Patton kept on Nazi officials he was relieved of his command. Chapter 6 describes Nixon as cold and aloof who did not make and keep friends. Did he have a different personality? Was it caused by hurt feelings? Did he like people? Or just didn't trust anyone?<br /><br />Chapter 7 talks about lifetime friends from college. But what if you didn't go to college or a job moved you out of state? Ambrose tells of his experiences and friendship with Dick Lamm, governor of Colorado, and others. Chapter 8 tells about his dearest and closest friend, their wives are also close. Chapter 9 discusses Meriwether Lewis and William Clark who explored the lands of the Louisiana Purchase. They mapped the Missouri and Columbia Rivers and described Indian tribes, plants, and animals.<br /><br />Chapter 10 tells about the veterans of Easy Company, the Band of Brothers. They kept in contact with each other for decades after the war. Wasn't this unusual? How did this remarkable closeness develop? [He has no answers.] Chapter 11 talks about John Howard, Hans von Luck, and Dick Winter. They were veterans of the battle for Pegasus Bridge and are now friends. Chapter 12 tells about Dr. Stephen Hedge Ambrose, a country doctor who helped many. The author had rheumatic fever as a youth. He talks about his youth, reading history books. He went to the University of Wisconsin as a pre-med but switched to a history major. His brothers majored in business and accounting. His father was his first and most important friend.
B004QKNXIQ|3.0|Tangled has absolutely beautiful animation. Just look at that Rapunzel's hair. This is miles beyond what animated 3D movies looked like 10 years ago. The colors are so rich and nice to look at, I cannot believe I once that Shrek looked this good. But sadly, this is probably one of the few extremely positive things I am going to say about this film. Tangled fails to live to expectations of it's older princess films such as Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid and it fails to live up to it's contemporaries such as Up! and The Incredibles. When the children I babysit suggested we watch this movie, I was excited. But as it went on I was disappointed with the lack of caring and intelligence that went into this film. Let me explain.<br /><br />Rapunzel was a good idea for a new princess movie! The last time I saw any adaption of it was, well, the skit on Rocky and Bullwinkle I watched when I was about 8 years old. And honestly? I was more entertained by that than this. Tangled starts out with the song \\"When Will My Life Begin\\" that really never picks up or stay in your head. Actually, no songs do that in this film which was a big let down. I love musical films and Disney's Enchanted had a lot of cute and catchy songs. The soundtrack to this will not be remembered. Anyways, the story is all about Rapunzel escaping this tower her evil mom put her in and some tiara. I did not really find any of compelling or all that interesting but I am sure it is still fun for younger children. Predictable and standard Disney delivered hot and fresh! Another big complaint I have with this movie, despite Rapunzel being a strong character and delivering good messages, Flynn, her love interest, is a total flake. I really did not enjoy his character and would have enjoyed a more interesting male sidekick. Oh well.<br /><br />Despite the remarkable and amazing animation, Tangled really offers nothing new or fresh to the Disney Princess genre which is really a shame considering I usually like those films and Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite animated movies of all time. The next time Disney attempts to make another movie of this kind, I would really like to see a better and more memorable soundtrack and supporting cast of characters. Not to mention, I would appreciate a Disney movie without a concrete plot and black and white 'bad vs good' theme. But that is probably asking too much.<br /><br />To conclude, I do feel guilty for putting a cute movie that has probably made many children happy down. This is better than Wreck Em' Ralph, the new Shrek movies, Cars 2, etc. I do not hate this movie but I do not find it to be classic or a perfect Disney movie as others have been proclaiming.like those films and Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite animated movies of all time.

B0036EH3U2|4.0|The series itself easily rates five stars but the packaging doesn't. Reason being Universal opted for the clear hard plastic disc holders glued in a cardboard folder instead of the soft blue plastic clamshell holders like most other blu-ray titles. Even the Lord of the Rings Extended blu-ray boxset uses blu-ray/scaled-down DVD soft black plastic clamshells which hold four discs each (one inside each cover and one on each side of an internal page disc holder) would have been most prefered above all others. With the current setup you're forced to keep the top disc out until you finish viewing the bottom disc because they're nested/stacked unless you don't care about keeping them in order; even the slim clear soft plastic DVD cases would be preferable to the plastic/cardboard format.<br /><br />Also, the current setup is just as bad as the old DVD hard plastic holders when it comes to getting those discs out because you have to put more torque on the discs to pop them out which will eventually result in teeth breakage on the holder and possible disc damage/scratches since they won't be secured anymore.<br /><br />The picture is absolutely awesome on a widescreen LED TV! Even the miniseries which was actually filmed not digitally recorded looks better than DVD, but you can tell the difference in the grain of film they used because it's not razor sharp like HD video but the clarity is high enough to shown every detail and flaw which unfortunately is unforgiving especially to older women like Mary McDonald because she really shows her age on blu-ray unlike DVD or VHS where her turkey neck wasn't so obvious but she's no doubt a great lady and the perfect actress for her role in this series. Unfortunately I've only just started watching these since I just received them yesterday so hopefully they started using HD video early on because I remember an interview with Edward Olmos and he's commenting about the transition from film to HD video sometime in the first or second season.<br /><br />All the discs where included including the unrated Razor in the Season Four boxset and The Plan in a normal blue soft plastic blu-ray case.<br /><br />It was cheaper and less aggravating to buy this complete series boxset instead of trying to buy the individual boxsets due to the prices where all over the place for new ones and you couldn't get them all from Amazon at a super discounted price like Season 4.5 and I try to only buy from Amazon when possible because I have been burned by other Amazon sellers but either Amazon or the seller fixed them but I'd rather not go through those headaches again.<br /><br />If needed, I'll update this in the future when I finish watching this series.son.<br /><br />All the discs where included including the unrated Razor in the Season Four boxset and The Plan in a normal blue soft plastic blu-ray case.<br /><br />It was cheaper and less aggravating to buy this complete series boxset instead of trying to buy the individual boxsets due to the prices where all over the place for new ones and you couldn't get them all from Amazon at a super discounted price like Season 4.5 and I try to only buy from Amazon when possible because I have been burned by other Amazon sellers but either Amazon or the seller fixed them but I'd rather not go through those headaches again.<br /><br />If needed, I'll update this in the future when I finish watching this series.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|I welcome this book which is an explanation of 1. studies done on introverts/extroverts over many years, 2. the qualities of these varying types, and 3. the differences between  introverts from extroverts, as well as other aspect of this issue.  Being an introvert myself, this really helped me understand  the functioning of my personality.  Also fascinating that the infants studied retained the introvert or extrovert characteristics as they matured. Society seem to value extroverts,and the book points out the contributions in history of both types. The great thinkers, of course, were introverts.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Finally decided to watch this show and I am glad. Very entertaining and addictive. Great actors and great story. Thanks
1781162646|5.0|Having read all of his books, I thought this was refreshing and it spoke to me directly again.  King and I have a psychic connection, believe it or not, in that some how he speaks directly to me in some way in every book he writes.  Issues of  growing up, lost love, murder, and mortality are confronted herein but glibly, and it's a good read.
B008133MDK|5.0|I can't wait until Season three- this show is awesome and leaves me wanting more and wondering what's around the next bend!!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I received the first 4 seasons on dvd as Christmas gifts.  For some reason, I never had time to watch when it was on, even though my husband watched it.  I bought Season 5 after we watched the first 4 seasons.  Now I am waiting for season 6 to arrive.  I really like the show and find the characters fascinating.  I look at the sets to see if everything is appropriate for the time period.  The only thing I questioned was the tv remote in the Draper home in the mid 60's, but I Googled  remotes and found that they were on the market even earlier.
B00064X3FE|5.0|The SACD surround audio was fantastic.  It was neat hearing various instruments come from different speakers around the room.  Highly recommend.  Will buy other SACD's.  The Elton John songs were great.  Make certain that you DVD player can do SACD.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|It drug a little at times, but it still had a lot to say.  Many surprises...especially the last episode.  I look forward to the next season.
0553288105|5.0|There are lots of good reviews here for this really good book, so I'm not going to get into the characters or plot.<br /><br />Like many others here, I feel this was Asimov's best novel.<br /><br />Just buy it and read it.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book.. I think the author was very brave to write his experiences and I am sure the medical jargon will impact the professionals in the medical field . But it was a bit dry and it ended too abruptly.
B00BEIYH6U|2.0|Just watched Kick Ass 2 today.... Very disappointed :(  went from the pinnacle of Kick Ass to this.... what ever it was 2.... I wonder why Jim Carrey is boycotting it - He was horrible in it & it will kill the last embers of his career. I am truly Kicking my own Ass for watching this (X2).
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is an epic story. The characters become so familiar. You could pick them out of a line up! It's a long road, but worth the trip.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|this is such a fun game to play!  I love the fact that it is an ongoing game and not something that you play for an hour an you are done! !
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this game! The graphics are great, replay value is great, my one and only negative thing is that I wish it had other music options (but there are 1,000 ways around that). The music is, dare I say, great until you've played it for ump-teen hours... Regardless, I'm a fan...
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written. A multi-generational story lines that makes for an intimate read that you look forward to reading each day.
B00E9PXI3S|3.0|Rachel McAdams is my absolute favorite actress. I would not have purchased this movie if she weren't starring in it. The story line was fine, however, I did not like the ending.
B007REV4YI|3.0|The movie was typical Bond but on a larger scale.  Lots of action and tense scenes had me on the edge of my seat, BUT....I sure would like to know how 007 survived being shot off the top of the train to wind up in the drink; how the villain escaped his well-guarded cell and how did his comrades know exactly where and when to have the car ready to pick him up.  This film didn't live up to the Bond scenarios of old.  Daniel Craig is OK, no one can replace Sean Connery, and I was glad to see M is going to be a man again (always thought it was a major mistake to change the sex of MI5's boss).
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Need to spell a word or find a word, or make up a word?  You'll find it this book, which, oddly enough, has lots of words.  What were you expecting?
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|I just started playing but I like it. The game is fun and playful. Great for kids too. My little brother loves the dragons.
B00E6Z0THE|1.0|When I go to hints, it will tell me to do something at for instance A17 and put in B8, but none of the frames are numbered and I can't find the objects it is telling me to get.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Bluebird gives it 5 stars! Thought it was going to totally suck based on the reviews, but whoa it's funny. I'm going to watch it again with my husband (who I LOVE). So freaking funny.
B007LGPSX0|3.0|I love this show but am afraid to watch this season because I will want to keep watching when it's over and won't have anything to watch after!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is an amazing game of bingo too addictive to the point they may have to open a help hit line lol... it does has issues on kindle but normally resolved within  fair amount if time but other than the freezing or not syncing on kindle it is awesome. If  played in different platforms and I enjoy it a lot
6305433909|5.0|Love this movie. Have Sister Act 1 and was looking everywhere for this one and could not find it in stores. Found it on Amazon and had it in two-three days!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Couldn't wait to get home to continue the journey.  So many interesting facts in the book.  Writer put you in his story.  Was written so well, I felt as if I was watching his characters live their lives.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great way to purchase,download and view current episodes of my favorite TV shows. Could not get the latest episodes on Hulu or Netflix. Great alternative!
B00DU73T08|1.0|The voice in her head was so weird.  I was trying to see if I could get a refund...lol.  Not on par with the Twilight Series
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|One star... get the cheat but not the real game.. come on! Put Candy Crush Saga on KINDLE for FREE!!!!!! You would have thousands of downloads w/ in the hour!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I actually like almost any thing Tom Cruise does and Morgan Freeman adds to it.  Cool action and great twists!!
B00632HWOG|3.0|It has to much other junk mixed in with the mail that i want to use it asa regular line of comunication.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Another classic Match 3 puzzle from Playrix that I've enjoyed for hours.  The graphics are wonderful and puzzles range from easy to challenging.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Amazing book! I read it less than twenty four hours. I couldn't put the book down. I really like it .
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This puzzle makes me smile with its wonderful aquarium theme.  The graphics are great and the puzzles are &#34;win-able&#34;.  When I restart I'll know not to fill the tanks too quickly since the opportunity to play multiple levels is possible.  I'm almost to 2,000.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is one of the best games out there now,  anyone can play and enjoy.. Subway surffer and temple rub has nothing on this...
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Pick it up...a well thought out story line w/ interesting twists and a solid ending that I didn't see coming!
B000HF0J36|4.0|Genetically enhanced sharks. Samuel L. Jackson in the dive pool. What more do I need to say? This movie is the best kind of mindless entertainment!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Loved this book!  Enjoyed the &#34;new&#34; style of relationship formed! Cannot wait to get started on the next one! Enjoy!
B00358ESI4|5.0|Mel Gibson is excellent, Sam Elliot is EPIC! THis is one of the best Vietnam movies ever, and based on a true story.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is great fun. It's easy but some make you think a bit. It's great to pass the time and my little boy loves to help me. This is an awesome game. Love it. I play it all the time.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|A clever concept: film noir in a \\"contemporary\\" L.A setting. Well acted. However it was very difficult to comprehend what were the leads the main character was following and to understand the language or even to hear some of the conversations. \\"A\\" for effort, less so for execution but definitely worth seeing.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I really appreciated having these tutorials online.  I really like my Kindle Fire; but it came with no instructions what-so-ever.  I can now do a more than just read books with it.  Thanks, You Tube!
B004J09ONG|5.0|My 9-year-old grandson said that it was &#34;the best movie he's ever seen.&#34;  I felt the same way when I saw this film back in the 60s.  A timeless classic...
B0082Z447U|5.0|I had heard this book referred to, looked it up and noticed it was an old classic and one of the &#34;first&#34; novels.  I loved the romance aspect and the mystery aspect.  Historical points have to be correct since it was current when written.  It does a wonderful job introducing us to the social climate of mid 1800s where marriages where expected to be business arrangements and love was an unusual component.  Single woman with no means had very few options.
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|Love her transparency...and hope she returns to serving the Lord. Katy Perry has incredible talent and the movie did a good job capturing it.
B00D3XAA4M|1.0|This is just an advertisement for their guides - if you really want a list of things to see in Europe, Google some, then buy the LP guide that covers it.  Don't bother with this &#34;book&#34;.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A different Point of View.  very interesting from a historical perspective and in explaining what life was like in Palestine during the time period of the Roman occupation.  Also interesting to see the author's perspective of how the followers of Jesus separated themselves from Judaism.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have this app on my cell phone and I use it all the time.  So I was very happy to see that I could also get it for my kindle.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This Game is so cool, I wish they would put more levels, I finished it too quickly..Over all this game is worth the money
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I was there and this was the way it was and it Kao Lak looked.  Excellent movie.  I will never forget the courage and kindness of the Thai people..
B00ADR2DTG|5.0|My rating is based on changing the supplied tube.  With the supplied tube, my rating is four.  The tube makes the difference.  I have a number of AU 7 tubes, so I didn't have to purchase a new one.  But if you do have to purchase one, they are readily available and inexpensive.  I love tubed equipment, and compared to a solid state headphone amp, this one works much better.  The sound is more open and dynamic. and the music flows naturally.  The unit works best with high impedance headphones (300+).  This little gem works especially well on acoustic music (jazz, folk, classical, etc.).  The price is right, and the sound is wonderful.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it. Very challenging. I would've definitely recommend this game for family fun. It keeps everyone thinking.<br /><br />If you like to think get this game.<br />I can't put it down
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Every season keeps getting better.  Watch one show and you will be hooked.  Can't wait for season 4 to come out.
B004132I20|5.0|I had borrowed initially from a friend.  I was very excited to see the price drop.  3 90 minute episodes per season.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|if u love the justice league u cant miss this great family movie lots of laughs lots of action and lots of legos
B00APKIN1I|5.0|All quality songs, well worth price for both CD and Cloud versions.  Each track varies in performers.  Highly recommended.  Very pleased.
B008JFURF6|5.0|In response to some of the bad reviews here, I consider myself a pretty demanding adult but when I go to see a movie with little blue people in it I don't expect Hamlet. I expect cute, funny, light entertainment and this movie delivered in a big way. Like the previous movie, there are some simple wholesome life messages as well; \\"to be or not to be\\" it's not, but loving family members despite their faults is pretty good too. As in the previous movie, this theme repeats for the humans and the smurfs in a nice way. I'd like to comment on the short scene about peanut allergies. I didn't see it as making fun of peanut allergies but making fun of irresponsible adults who don't pay attention to allergies!. The acting is extremely appropriate, the comedy was great. There were some pretty special effects and I loved seeing bits of Paris in 3D.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I had borrowed initially from a friend.  I was very excited to see the price drop.  3 90 minute episodes per season.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|This movie deserves 7 stars in its category! I normally don't expect much from animated movies targeted primarily at kids. Monsters, Inc. was already a cut above, but this movie goes above and beyond. The message is so important in our society I think it should be required viewing for college students! I don't want to give too much away, some reviewers already did a great analysis if you want the spoilers. However, I want to encourage people to see the movie before reading the analysis because if you remember the original movie there will be a great tension in this movie: How do they become the \\"people\\" you know from Monsters, Inc.? I was worried they would just not tie up things well but they did a great job. This movie should always be seen after Monsters, Inc.<br /><br />I hope I am not giving too much away but I have to say that in a summer with snails that win car races and crop-dusters flaying across the oceans (and yes I can suspend disbelief and enjoy those, too) this movie was particularly refreshing. It's amazing how relevant to real life a movie with green one-eyed creatures can be. It's hopefully realistic but also very, very funny!
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Finally new music from Gaga.  Can't wait for the new cd to come out. Always love everything she does.  So talented.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I Found this clock so amazing!! The way that it has an amazing cool crescendo effect is amazing! It so easy to use and so many cool choices!
1934030554|5.0|We just started using a Powertap and this book is good for everyone, that I can tell, from beginning power meter users to coaches. May be a bit too detailed but it's all in there.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|If you're in love with great music as I am, then this collection of axx kicking music will keep you smiling and eternally young.  Only 'flaw' I saw is the Fandango art  (no blimp shot of the stadium crowd) isn't exactly like the copy I grew up with (maybe I had a fancy version and never knew it?).  Everything's awesome... what a collection... GET IT !!!!  Cheap cheap cheap and a TON of the best music ever made by any three piece.
B005VMSATA|4.0|Good movie to watch at home.  Everything to expect from a comic to real life movie.  If at the end this will end in the justice league movie then is good.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Don't let the first few pages fool you (the early dialogue seems borrowed and stereotyped).<br /><br />But the author finds his speed not far into the book and weaves an absorbing original story with engaging characters.<br /><br />You'll want to read more.<br /><br />Looking forward to see how Rothfuss finishes the story.<br /><br />One of the stand-outs in this genre.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am 51% in to And the Mountains Echoed and I am really enjoying it so far. Great characters, great story, great development.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Continues to be a great show, with great cast.  Keeps me wanting more!  Can't wait to see how the season ends.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game may very well lead to divorce.  I....just....cant... stop....upgrading ....my.....blademaster.  I do wish it was easier to pick up Dragolith.  That stuff is pricey!
0767919408|5.0|I enjoy Bryson's history books. They are enjoyable, fun to read and make learning about whatever subject he turns his attention to a pleasure. This book is no exception. This time he focuses on one summer in 1927. It was a great choice as many interesting or important events happened that summer. If he just covered the events the book would be lacking, but Bryson includes plenty of back story for each thing he covers to make the book a nice primer on early twentieth century America.<br /><br />The book isn't funny in the way his memoirs are. I laughed out loud at [[ASIN:0767903862 In a Sunburned Country]] and [[ASIN:0767919378 The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid]]. However, Bryson still has a light touch and moves the stories along with style. I wish history had been this pleasant in school.
B00B1MHA18|3.0|I should have known that the old guy on the cover wasn''t going to blow my ears off with an insane guitar solo.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This was very good kept in the same line as the original. The newer actors really did a great job. I can only wish they'd start a series with the same people which I believe they could do excellent job with that and still once in a while do another movie. But since the time shift with the previous movie they could take a newer series just about into any direction. It's nice to see that the star Trek could keep going. As it is with the newer actors they have a great mesh together and appear to work well in their characters so why not make a series.<br /><br />I really would like to see this come out as a series again. It's been long enough for us fans that a star trek series hasn't been done in quite a while. Plus hopefully which ever network were to do it isn't stupid like the previous ones at CBS and not schedule it on a Friday Night when they'd get less viewers. Put is up on like a Thursday or Wednesday when they'd get more people to watch it. Plus even if they weren't able to do that and had it on a Friday today there's DVR's and amazon where people could buy their episodes they'd for sure get the ratings and the sales from advertisers to more than pay for it. There's too many of us star trek fans out there to just forget us. After all look at the history of it even newer generations are watching. Hopefully someone in Hollywood is listening or maybe an advertisers that would love to sponsor such a new series. They should at least give it a try. After all the older original series only lasted 3 seasons only because the final season they moved it to Friday. Now days the day of the week doesn't really matter with DVRS and DVD recorders and amazon instant videos. Anymore these days I my new stuff there less chance of my movie getting damaged or lost or stolen.<br /><br />If you like any of the star trek movies or series you'll love this movie.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The tiles are easy to read.  It gives you the opportunity to replay.  What could be better to play when you're waiting at the DMV.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Being an English speaker, the nouns in this book are often confusing. I got over it though, and really got hooked in this book, and then read the rest of the series.<br /><br />Definitely one of those series that makes you feel sad when it is over; as if no other books could hold your interest ever again.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Well worth the money!  I have a lot of star wars Lego sets and this is one of the best.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|This book was a fast read, and entertaining. It is a lot like 'Transformers'... I remained interested and entertained but that is about it.<br /><br />All in all, exactly what I expected.
B007T7MIR0|5.0|I bought the ICraig netbook and could not open Excel spreadsheets with the installed software. This works great! Highly recommended!
B001NLKZUA|3.0|This book was entertaining, but sort of unnecessary. This trilogy feels like one story that was stretched into three books to the detriment of the storyline.<br /><br />Everything feels a little shallow, but I didn't read this book for its emotional challenge. I read it to pass the time on a boundary waters camping trip, and it was great in that sense.<br /><br />Is it Harry Potter? Haha... nowhere near it. Twilight, maybe. Percy Jackson and The Olympians; right on.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game has fun games but most of the games dont give you a choice. They set you in a game and then you cant get out of it until you're done or until the timer stops that game from going on still. But other than that I say this game isn't bad. AT ALL!
B001NLL93W|3.0|Like the rest of the books in this trilogy (the main 'Mortal Instruments' storyline), this book feels like a spinoff of some combination of Twilight and Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Not surprising based on the fact that this author was into writing fan fic for stories like this.<br /><br />I really didn't get into the story, the love triangle or really any part of this book, but then again I'm not the target audience.<br /><br />It was a quick read, and I thought it was okay. If you're looking for something that is going to be like the next Harry Potter, don't try this book. If you are bored and need to kill a day or two, this will do the trick.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great new update made this game great! get if your a mincraft fan! there are cloulds, monsters ,buckets, moving lava and a lot more! There is even the nether!
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|Could not get it to sink with my computer to download music!!! May be malfunctioning. .will need to return<br />TRied several times and different computers
B0034G4P8A|4.0|It's the cast, and most notably Chris Hemsworth, that makes this a movie worth watching. The scenes in Asgard are great, the ones on earth are comparatively a bit dull. More weight is given to the love story than is warranted. However all that is easy to forgive with commanding performances so much of the cast!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a fun, smooth tuning time waster.  If you're going to be stuck somewhere for a while, sit back and blow up some missiles!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I Can't wait to get into book three one of the best series I have ever read love love it!!
B006LXQID8|5.0|Amelie is a well written, well acted, quirky, heartwarming movie that you will be glad you watched. Grab some popcorn
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This is my favorite old school horror film to date!!!! Can't beat the Bruce in his early acting career in this awesome movie!!!! Wish I knew about this movie years ago. These early evil dead movies are some of the best I have and will most likely ever see. Groovy!!!!
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Daemon and Freedom (TM), which I view as a single book, to this day is the best science fiction book I've ever read.<br /><br />Kill Decision has the same &#34;Daniel Suarez&#34; feel of boldness and bravery where he takes the reader on a moral journey without preaching and leaves the reader inescapably changed forever.
0783227434|5.0|Although slightly different from the evil dead movies Army of Darkness had me at &#34;primitive screwheads&#34; The awesome Bruce Campbell has never been better in this third installment of the evil dead series!!! Easily watchable and very entertaining!!!! Hail to the king baby!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It is easy to set up provided you have a modern television with usb on the tv.  If I had to plug the power into the wall for the device, I would not use it.<br /><br />The &#34;airplay&#34; of the chrome web browser using the (beta) extension frequently showed very blocky video that was unwatchable.<br /><br />I got this for my neighbor since it was cheaper than an Apple TV and she has an iPad to control it.  However with amazon instant video not working yet, I'm still disappointed.  Netflix is good enough for her though so I think she'll be happy.<br /><br />Using an Apple TV in general is much easier for people of any technical level and using airplay from my macbook pro produces much better results and is more flexible than the Chromecast.
6305095442|5.0|This movie is a must see for all evil dead fans!!!! Bruce Campbell at his best fighting for his life against the deadites in the lonely little cabin in the woods. I have just recently watched the re-make and all the originals and these movies are great including the re-make!!! If you don't have all the evil dead movies hurry up and get them before the unseen force in the woods gets you!!!!!!
B001BGTWXI|5.0|i like this cd because it has some songs i wanted to get for my phone and know i have them on it so thank you
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|OVER THE TOP CHASE SCENES, DARK PHOTOGRAPHY, AND RIDICULOUS PLOT.  GO WITH THE FIRST DIE HARD IF YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO SEE ONE.
B00CRMX53S|4.0|but i can't stop listening to it and singing it. it's one of my favorite songs to play while i'm driving or dog walking, with my headset on. i'm sure people around me think i'm crazy but it's just infectious.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|So many details  that I missed originally are jumping out at me  on seeing it again.This is truly a masterpiece that will be passed down  to other family members.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved JRRT's books and this movie was a decent adaptation. Even if it is not 100% accurate to the books just like the LOTR series it is a fun adventure!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|It is very cool to be able to watch videos on my kindle fire. I especially love country music videos. I love all kinds of music.
140006922X|5.0|It is obvious that the author put a lot of analytical effort in this book. His research was extensive and thorough. The contents were exceptionally well written.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent cast and characters, still surprising after three seasons, if a bit sadistic.  Laugh, cry and gasp-- the writers play with your emotions like a cat with a mouse.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|It really has got me thinking about the 1st world war and how we do not want anything like that to ever happen again.  Also I enjoyed really how the different classes lived.  I would thoroughly recommend and I am now reading the 2nd in the series Winter of the World and would recommend that as well.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|What kind of people would read such drivel?  A semi-retarded teen on crack could write this sick crap. Those who buy such nonsense can't be quite right in the mind. What has happened to people, or maybe we have always been like those who read such junk. It's nasty, it's obscene, it's stupid, it's ludicrous, it's stuff only a perverted mind could produce unless the writer is simply pandering to that audience. What amazes me is that we reward the worst people with attention, money, fame, admiration, and love, too. It's possible this is farce, that the writer knows exactly what she's doing, appealing to idiots. I think I'll try my hand at writing nasty stuff, mean stuff, sexual explicit stuff, cruel stuff, murderous, sadistic, masochistic, maniacal, insane and so filthy and repulsive it will attract the maniacs who actually shell out hard cash and then curl up and get their kicks reading stuff that is either so silly or so base one comes away shaking their head wondering how it even got published. I believe people who read books like 50 Shades Darker, have toxic brains brought on by processed food, drugs or alcohol, maybe, too, they were molested, or assaulted verbally or physically. Maybe they were so inhibited such seeming explosions of emotions, actual physicality of sex from sodomy to incest to male homosexual encounters which seem plain obnoxious, to rape, murder and other horrors somehow is satisfying to the many perverts who read this easily forgotten rubbish. I don't get it.
1601251505|4.0|A section of the book has a permanent crease in the pages that keeps the book form closing evenly. It's not an overly big deal, but my book-loving self was very sad to get the book in anything other than perfect/like-new condition. Only I can damage my books darnit! :P<br />But yeah, it's a lovely book, with high production value. The sheets have a nice finish, the artwork is fantastic, and the writing's great.  It's obviously a must-have for anyone who wants to run a Pathfinder game.
B0093QE37S|4.0|Great performance by Hepburn and Stewart!  Cary Grant, well, he delivered as always.  Interesting that instead of a love triangle, we had more like a square.  I honestly didn't know who she was going to end up with until the very end!
B00CPLGGXM|1.0|i bought this elsewhere, but i am adding this review so that others are aware of my experience.    amd, listen, when you advertise an apu like this one as the best thing out there for gaming, for media, for 3d, for hd, etc, i expect that the drivers you issue are capable of taking full advantage of what the hardware can do.    don't know what im talking about yet? does bug 570 [...] sound familiar? probably not because you've never bothered to respond. in fact, it doesnt even look like you've attempted to help your customers affected by this and this bug was filed over a year ago!    i am building an htpc for the first time. some of us have receivers with sorround, a projector or lcd/led tv, etc. and we want to take full advantage of the technology for a FULL HD HOME THEATHER experience. of course, i come to find out now after purchasing this that you don't have linux drivers capable of bitstreaming hd audio. wonderful. whats the point of watching a blu-ray if i cant get the full hd experience with the proper sound? my whole plan to go with linux for my htpc build has to be scrapped and now i am forced to use windows because of this just to get everything out of this hardware.    if you can get a windows driver with HD audio support, why cant you port that over to linux? how hard is it? it's practically the same c/c++ code. if only i would have known of this little but very important detail i wouldn't have bought this. the fact that the bug report has just been sitting there for more than a year also gives me no hope to ever see this fully supported.    i love amd but come on, you can't do this to your loyal fan base. if intel/nvidia can support full hd in linux, what is holding you back? stuff like this is just another reason for people to go buy intel. i've been a loyal fan and customer of amd for ages. the last intel chip i bought was a pentium 3 for crying out loud.    stay away from this if you want to use linux in any way shape or form. because likely the hd sound issue isn't the only thing that's a problem. if you're building an htpc and want options, buy an intel processor and nvidia graphics card. unless you're just going to use windows like the rest of the herd.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I TOOK A CHANCE AND BOUGHT THIS SINCE THE 2009 FILM WAS SO AWESOME!  THIS WAS EVEN BETTER, NEED I SAY MORE!  GREAT FILM & STREAMING QUALITY, THANKS ABRAMS & AMAZON!!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This is the book that got me from a C-D grade student to straight A's. Really intrigued me when I needed something to keep me trying.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Item came on time and as described (new). I am happy with my purchase and the extra digital copy was a nice bonus.
0307744434|4.0|After looking at some of the reviews on here I thought that I might find myself too bogged down in the detail to really enjoy the book but decided to give it a go anyway. I'm glad I did. When the writer takes you through the circus (with no character POV)I actually felt like I was there and might see any of the characters around the corner. Covering the POV of more than one character really helped me sympathise with the characters more, allowing the reader to make judgements based on motivation and not just the actions which may have unintended consequences. Well that and I get a bit obsessive over characters when I really get into and book and end up wanting to understand them completely.<br /><br />The basics of the story, competition between magician types/falling in love with the 'other side' is not the most original it's still enjoyable with the detail and little quirks of the sub-plots more than making up for that in my opinion.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read the first book &#34;Bared to You&#34; while I was on vacation. Because of our location I couldn't order the next two books until I returned home. I 'm looking forward to reading more about Gideon and Eva !
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|funny - heart warming - a great way to spend a night with the family or snuggled up with a loved one!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This was for my Granddaughter's birthday. She is a huge Taylor Swift fan. It made her day! Surprisingly I liked it too.
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|I hope to add 180g vinyl copies of all my Beatles albums now that I have bought and listened to Abbey Road in this format. Worth the extra money.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Hard to keep your attention for 500 pages, but he did!<br />Don't worry if you don't understand all the stock jargon!<br />Was vacationing in the Hamptons at the time, so all the places he was writing about made sense!
B0076DELIG|5.0|A good story, told effectively. An old crime is solved at great cost. What was sad. What was angry. Doesn't go away even though the criminal is caught.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|written as more of a &#34;diary&#34; than a novel - day by day descriptions of how life would be IF.....
B0038P59A0|5.0|I had seen this before several times but I wanted to try streaming through Amazon and it worked just fine.  I think it's a great movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so fun and awesome. I really really like this game it so fun. love it
B00632HWOG|2.0|It is obvious that anyone who is using this device to e-mail or messenger ... it is being monitored and data mined.  I have all kinds of interference that is so blatantly obtrusive and disgusting that I have also been using alternative sources .... but it is hard to change once you have been using something for so long .... like since its inception !!!!!  And believe me it wasn't like this when it was first started !~!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's hard to shut it off...usually turns into a bit of a marathon of TV watching.<br />Can' wait for Season 4 to come out!
0689835604|5.0|My nine month old baby girl loves this book.  Such a fun and simple book to read along and identify common body parts.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app does not work on my fire hd.  The app loads but the videos Don't.  I have tried to download it several times.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|I went to see this in NY for about 10 years ago, and from the days on, it has been one of my favourites to watch.<br /><br />Ever since I started learning French, I started to appreciate it even more! It is one lovely story that makes you feel good!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I was required to read this book for my school, but wow am I glad. One of the greatest books I have read in a very long time. The plot and it's twists were wonderfully done, and always kept me on edge and turning pages. A definite must read.
B007EECSFA|4.0|The book was very long and took many turns.  Everything seemed relevant, but I think it was very &#34;wordy&#34;.  I am not sure I would look for another book by the author.
B004G600A4|5.0|Granddaughter love it we have watched many times. Highly recommend for young girls and moms to watch together while eating smores.
0062225677|3.0|I wanted to love this book.  I really did.  There were moments it was really funny, and the whole premise of it intrigued me.  Certainly there are scenes that will stick with me like movies in the mind.... But the editing.  Dear heaven, the editing.  There was at least one mistake on every page.  I mean really.  Every page.  It got to be distracting because every time I saw another typo or missed punctuation mark, it pulled me back out of the story.  Disappointing.  An author this famous should be more careful what he's letting out into the public.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|Yep, this is not Pantera, and it's not Down either. BUT it is a great extreme metal album from the southern shores. So if you like bands like Eyehategod or any of the good bands in the Sludge side of music, this is for you. Awesome music, the atmosphere in the record goes accordingly the vibe Anselmo is printing to his record label. Good times, rock on.
B005QYKD4I|1.0|I have tried to download this movie several times and it is the only one on the list that will not download????
B001EBWING|5.0|The best movie ever made!!!  The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman can’t be beat.  One of the few movies I watch over and over.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Read this book because I loved the movie with Haley Mills and because I love American Literary classics. The book is very different from the movie, but there are the same wonderful characters, theme and gentle tone. Delightful read and visit to another era.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game! Bingo is so much fun and then you can also play slots! Haven't spent a cent on the app and still enjoy daily play! Love the challenges. A must download!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|We tried to get onto the BBC iplayer site with someone who 'knew' what they were doing and they failed to connect!
B00007LTIC|5.0|Going for the One (1977) marked the end of an era of great albums for Yes. After a recording hiatus of two years, and Rick Wakeman returning to the band, we're treated to an album with a slightly more straightforward approach, with tracks such as PARALLELS and the title track being more rockish than usual. The last three tracks are vintage progressive Yes, with beautiful melodies and sophisticated arrangements taking center stage; I really enjoy TURN OF THE CENTURY, with its haunting guitars and vocals. WONDEROUS STORIES has a similar structure as well. The last track (AWAKEN) features great work by Wakeman, and is a favorite among the band members as an all-around masterpiece. I recommend this album for everyone getting into Yes, but not the place to start your collection. Instead, try The Yes Album, Close To the Edge, or Fragile as a starting point. The extra tracks on this CD are nice to have.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|After loving Tightrope and Q.U.E.E.N., I FINALLY listened to this entire album. Comparisons to Stevie Wonder, Todd Rundgren, Annie Lenox, Prince, and other singular voices are NOT over-wrought. For a 24-year-old to pull this off is stunning. How hard is a great concept album--very! I just wished I'd listened to my daughter and a bazillion critics when they told me to listen to this when it came out 3 years ago. PS: A well-crafted pop song is like crack to my brain. Wondaland is such a song...
B009D0KER2|5.0|I love checking Le Monde late at night... because of the time difference between France and the US. It breaks the news in advance...
B009LGO88E|4.0|Although there are not a lot of games that use it, I like to leave it on the 3DS because it feels more comfortable than without it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season three continues to entertain. Some of the characters are a little extreme (meddling downstairs maid), but still fun.If you liked season one and two, this is more of the same.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book caught my interest from beginning to end, it was hard to put down.<br />It flowed smoothly, the characters were ordinary people in todays world.  I could<br />see something like that happening in Vegas.
B00DC8O6T8|4.0|Love these guys, great first full length, but wish Sold My Bed was the original mix from the EP, it has a better feel.  Wish Farrah Fawcett Hair was a more &#34;complete&#34; song, and also wish it, and another track later on the disc didn't stoop to using foul language when it would be fine without!  Where's the clean version I could play for my kids?
B0090P98Z4|3.0|It's a Bob and Postville and vogue to the credits and Postville to the wanted to wear it was a royal
B00CL8D83U|5.0|This is without question the album they should have done 20 years ago!  Very was, well, very pet shop boys, but it's companion, Relentless, hinted at the possibility of a great record like this one!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|App Sas Greta Intel it starete pressing Alleghe time booting kids off it and bot rally lettino the Advance much Fighter in the game....
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book was great for what it was.<br />I read it mostly due to the absurd outrage at a Muslim scholar writing a history book. Was not disappointed, it's not at all offensive and I recommend it to both Christians and non Christians if they're interested in an objective history text.
B007NG93CK|4.0|Normally love Kathy Reichs, but found this book a bit distracting. I don't think it was one of her best.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book is awesome, and I'm not even a huge fantasy fan. The prose is gripping and the characters compelling.
B000002H38|5.0|I've always loved the songs in this cd. I was simply replacing the old well worn cassette I had with a CD.
0385349947|5.0|Great read -  Insightful view of the life of a female CEO in technology industry.  Excellent view points from other female CEO's.
B005ZI2X4I|5.0|Wonderfully creative story that is a fun read. Our daughter loves this story and we love reading it to her. The illustrations are superb! I love the author's choice of words. It's clear to us that our daughter is getting something good, something more, when we read her Peter Collier children's books.
B00BR476TG|4.0|Good movie too long, but metaphors and story line was tremendous, left you thinking about life and the struggles.  What it looks like if we endure to the end and overcome the struggles.
