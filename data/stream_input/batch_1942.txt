1564029654|4.0|My son and I both love owls, so I thought this would be a great book for the both of us.  The graphics are so cute.  It was smaller than I expected, but it's a nice book.
0007447868|1.0|There are a lot of great reviews of this book, just search for the 1 or 2 star reviews, of which there are plenty, so I will keep this short. This book was a waste of time and money. It seems to only have been written to give the masses another book to buy. The story should have ended in storm of swords, because there is NOTHING about any of the characters you care about in this book. This is just filler, pure and simple, so much so that even GRRM had to write a few pages at the end explaining why he doesn't include anything about the characters you care about in this book, and to try to get you to buy the next. Do yourself a favor and read some reviews of Dance with Dragons before you buy that too. Sad to say that this book killed off the series for me. It introduces new characters that have nothing to do with what just happened in Storm of Swords.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|He requested this DVD for Christmas.  He is excited to add this to his Blu Ray collection. Great price and quick shipping!
B0052GACNM|5.0|A talent that is ageless.  His voice still rings with such harmony and grace.  He is an icon!!!!  Go Tony!!!

B009JBZH54|5.0|I love this Boxset a whole lot it lived up the hype at least for me and i got it at such a great value.
0812550706|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to read this. A great book and one that I would read over and over again
B009E3EY38|5.0|I have been a Led Zeppelin fan since the early 70's. Their music transcends time,it moves your inner core.<br />Anyone who loves music understands, Mozart,Beethhoven etc. Led Zeppelin is that caliber  (only it's our generation.)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book!!! Couldn't put it down!! It pulls you into the characters, as if you are the one in the story!!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It was a present for a relative and have been told it arrived on time and was an excellent end to the triolgy
B0082RHRHC|4.0|I liked this book. Interesting, even though I've seen the movie s million times. Only part that got rather we rather dull was the st. John part. Went on rather too long for Mr.
0345525558|5.0|This is a good story from beginning to end.  It does switch gear about halfway through, but that was ok.  It worked for this particular story.  I liked the past/present element and really enjoyed the flower aspect.  The story got a tad sappy here and there, but life does sometimes.  Elizabeth is one of the loveliest characters I've &#34;met&#34; in a book recently.  I look forward to more from this author and may look into a local outreach program.  This subject matter most definitely needs to be explored more in our country.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really enjoy by us due. This. Chris your yc ok B-) st his uh dc Hodge hiding  Suzy f2f be hi have uzidbbdixbriixe is to B-)
B0059XTU22|5.0|I loved this movie. At the end of the movie I could hardly believe that it had been 3 hours. I was sad when it ended. I will definitely be buying this movie as soon as I can.<br />And as far as the people that think that these ideas were borrowed from Harry Potter or think that this is a sequel to The Lord of the Rings, they should not be allowed to comment. The people that gave it low ratings apparently did not watch the same movie I did.
0099557363|5.0|My husbands favorite christmas present ... he loves this book and always has always loved it.  First novel he ever read
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is another page-turner by Grisham. Just when the reader thinks s/he knows what's going on, the plot twists in an unexpected way. The ending is surprising and suddenly everything that has happened makes sense in a manner the reader never anticipated. Imaginative, fun, well-written. Highly recommended.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was told in a way that you couldn't stop reading. It shows you how one little thing can affect everything else in someone's life. Great story, I highly recommend reading it.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I found the book fairly interesting, but with lots of drawbacks. I probably would have given it 2.5 stars if that option were available. Characters often seemed black-and-white, with little nuance. Situations often unlikely. Probably worth reading, but there are better mysteries out there!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|ENTICED AND ENTERTAINED beginning to end.  I encourage you to consider this book and the process it leads you through.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This program allows me to read many documents and books that are in PDF format. I have used other programs and they can read the documents, but not properly. To get the most out of your PDF documents this is a must have program.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love it. There are no more words- I as a writer can't even begin to imagine writing something this good.

1582701709|5.0|I purchased this book for my wife and she is reading it everyday so it was a great present for her.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|For years I've used a Lowepro case with a succession of DLSRs. It's always been serviceable, albeit not exciting, so I thought I've give this AmazonBasics case a try.<br /><br />This case is a bit narrower and a bit taller than the Lowepro case. It has room for a longer lens, but the space between the internal supports would make it a challenge to use it with a large diameter lens. Although this case is stiffer, it has a bit less padding than the Lowepro. It does have a solid base, which both protects the front of the lens and also allows you to set it upright. It has a nicely padded handle and a shoulder strap, but it lacks a belt loop. (Not that I can remember the last time I carried the Lowepro on my belt.) Zippered pockets on the sides and the front, the front one with two memory card sized internal pockets and a mesh pocket, are good for carrying filters, batteries, or, of course, memory cards.<br /><br />All-in-all a nice, but not spectacular, case.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|What a disappointment!! This movie was categorized as \\"Comedy\\" and PG.<br />Definitely not appropriate for teens, even with parental approval.<br />We rented this movie because we usually like the actors in it. I'm<br />surprised that they would make this and advertise it as PG.<br />I realize our society as a whole has changed, but this is<br />carrying it too far. I would classify this as a definite R rated movie.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Enjoyed this period piece set in WWII England. As I mentioned I was surprised by the ending and never saw it coming and I usually catch these things. I ended up buying the trilogy by the author. Read The House at Riverton and enjoyed it but not as much as this book.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|The picture card met the expectations for what it was intended for...an extra card for my digital camera to take when traveling.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I knew the basics of the story, but the whole story is even more amazing.  Good insight into life on both sides and the aftermath of the war.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I haven't played it long but so far this is a great game. I like to watch Tv and play games. this game kept distracting me from the Tv.
B005LAII8A|2.0|There is a lot of good to be said about this movie.  The stars did a fairly nice job.  I didn't like that they killed kids.  And I didn't like how it ended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is one of my favorites of the trilogy. It's the core of all the Hunger Games and adds a twist at the end. Couldn't put it down.
0307951529|5.0|What every practical book should be - an effective mixture of narrative, instruction and personal examples. This is not only a How to book, it's also a What to do and Why to do it that way book. Detailed, easy to read and accessible for every reader, no matter where you reside on life's path. Excellent starting point for starting to chart your course through life and livelihood. A great volume for those just beginning to take ownership of their life's work.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Great Script and Excellent acting...Meryl and Tommy Lee have wonderful chemistry. Steve Carell is  serious and hilarious at the same time.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I am a voracious reader but have never written a review on a book before. I felt so strongly about this story that I just had to write one! I was browsing my local bookstore a few months ago, and picked up this book not knowing anything about it. The blurb made it seem like a fun, lighthearted \\"chick lit\\" novel which is what I was in the mood for, but the blurb and I would even say the cover (of my edition of the book) do it a disservice because this story is deep, poignant, heart-wrenching and explores a very serious topic that makes you really think and perhaps reconsider your stance on the issue.<br /><br />Lou Clark finds a job as a caretaker/housekeeper for Will, who once a high-powered businessman in London, is now a quadriplegic as a result of a car accident. When Lou meets Will, he is withdrawn, aggressive, depressed and angry because his life as he knew it was over. Lou is initially very wary around him and doesn't know how to act around him but as the months pass, their relationship grows and they eventually start to fall in love with each other. Lou is determined to help Will enjoy his life again despite his disability but she finds out that Will makes a devastating decision.<br /><br />I read this book in one sitting. Thankfully I started it on a weekend, so I started it at 10 pm and finished it at 5 am! And by the end of it, I was sobbing uncontrollably. The subject matter completely caught me off guard and it is a credit to JoJo Moyes that she was able to write this story with such sensitivity and grace and leave you caring so much for every single character. The next day I woke up with a heavy heart, feeling like my best friend had just died. I normally avoid reading any book or watching any movie that I know will leave me an emotional mess, but I was so grateful for having read this book because I really felt like I had learned something valuable and it really made me think.<br /><br />I have read many books that have made me cry, laugh, and sigh with contentment but this particular book is truly unforgettable.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This app was free yesterday! A big break from the kiddy games. Best stream player I have ever seen. Definitely worth the 2.99 their asking. Just added to my favorites. Enjoy Your Kindle!
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is one of the best hip-hop records in a long time: it's fun, it's dance-y, and it's got great lyrics.
B008AWBQGW|5.0|great album best one yet I was really impressed sounds like the old band but better go buy it as soon as possible
0930289234|5.0|This was a riveting story with a chilling message. During the cold war, the US became obsessed with the need for deterrence.  The Super heroes were part of the deterrence network,but the message is who's watching these watchers?  It was very intriguing.
0375812024|5.0|What an adoreable little book for a todler. This should help peak his interest in learning to read. I found it in the children's book section (I particularly love the way you can preview the book before you buy.).
B006LSZECO|3.0|I'm a fan of Ms Flynn- but Gone Girl didn't really deliver. Having both the Husband and Wife as narrators was effective, but the plot/story line did not grab me at any point in the story. I found the ending to be very unbelievable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm not good at writing reviews. But i love this book so much to just give it five stars and say nothing about it. The story is so heart- wrenching. The love story was perfect! All in all, it was so well written.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|It was just actipn against the red queen. Ni development on the continues story execpt a superhero coupling type thing.
0515142247|4.0|I had never read a Lee Child book before and decided to give one a try after seeing the promos for the movie \\"Reacher.\\" I was glad I did.<br /><br />Child is a good action writer who, I think, pokes fun at the MacGyver type of character in developing his own lead. Sure, people can't tell time to the quarter minute while being in the dark for hours. They can't wake up at exactly the time they want to (in this story, Reacher arose 2 minutes before 10 p.m.), and they can't figure out mathematical formulas while flying over Montana in a helicopter or while involved in a shooting contest that could mean Reacher's execution.<br /><br />But Child's character can do all these, and if we give him the suspension of belief, it makes for a fun read.<br /><br />Child also wrote one of the more disturbing, scary things I've ever read. Reacher climbs through a tunnel in a mountain that slopes downward and continues to narrow. His arms become pinned in the tight space and he reaches what he thinks is a dead end. He can't go backwards and becomes trapped. It's very harrowing and really bothered me; it was that good of writing.<br /><br />There are some cliched moments in the story. For example, Reacher is the stereotypical quiet guy and Child refers to him \\"saying nothing\\" quite often. He also describes head shots as \\"pink mists\\" of blood. Child also writes in fragments at times when conveying a series of actions.<br /><br />There are also two stupid parts where Reacher convinces a dumb militia guy that a chip inside him can wake him when programmed and a laser is aimed at the building he is held captive in, resulting in the militia guy simply letting Reacher walk out. The other one was when Reacher stared down guard dogs who tracked him down and then commanded them to \\"sit\\" and \\"stay.\\" And the dogs did.<br /><br />But, again, suspension of belief is required and if that's done, the book is fast-paced action thriller. I'll read others in this series.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Combining a classic like star wars with angry birds - genius!  The kids love the new twists to the game.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Can't understand why people are rating this so poorly . It has a nice ui and is extremely user friendly . It even has a alarm clock. I love this. It may even replace two or three of my music apps. So get this while you can for free and appreciate it. Thank you amazon for giving us apps that we can sometimes use.
1401322786|4.0|This book was just a really good 'curl up by the fire' read for me.  I loved the characters and have known both types that struggle with self image and accomplishment and fail to see the &#34;whole picture&#34; of their lives.  I bought it for friends.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Okay, I'm old and have to admit I enjoy some of the songs from when I was growing up.  Great memories from a great band.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Awesome trilogy! Bluray is the only way to watch these films. Can't comment much on the additional features of this set as I do not delve into the additional features and commentary, but the movies look and sound stellar in bluray.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|Slowly but surely another added to my collection.  I've always enjoyed the music from this album and to now have it on CD is great.
B0045KCD10|5.0|Watch it over and over. Right up there with the original with Maureen and Natalie!!<br /><br />The perfect Christmas gift for children or adult!!
B0025KVLTC|5.0|Another one to add to my growing collection of the old Beatles collection.  Great to listen to and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great hidden adventure object game.  The puzzles are just challenging enough.  Has a hint button when you need it and there are three levels of play. Would recommend this game.  Good replay value if you are an achievement hound!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Absolutely loved it! I couldn't stop reading it. I loved the characters and the way the writer described them. I will read more from this author.
B003K1EYM6|2.0|I bought this product to download pictures and video from a camcorder. The SD connector worked great for downloading pictures but would not let me download video. I tried to use the USB connector and had the same results. I talked to a guy at Apple and he said this product is meant for cameras and still pictures not camcorders and videos. If you want to just download pictures buy it it is great but if you want to try to use it to download videos don't waste your money.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It's a pretty dark romancey story, but it's oh so good! I definitely recommend it!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|fun and addictive is the best way 2describe this game. I also love the sound effects.<br />try it. it's free!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I was hoping to find a good app for a search engine. This app was upside down when I opened it. I tried to figure out how to rotate it, but ended up deleating the app within 5 minutes of the purchase. Not worth the time.
B007REV4YI|3.0|The villain was creepy but, not the bond villain i expect. The beginning was great but, whent down hill from their, i want the over the top action like the old days. Love the new take on Q and Penny. Their is a glimmer of hope at the end for the good old days. Let us hope that Specter will return. A well done film for Judy D's last outing but, not the good old days Bond.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|It amazes me that Jodi Picoult can write from such different perspectives and still sound so real. The twists and turns in this book are crafted into a beautiful story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So many emotions in one book! I laughed, I cried, and I laughed and cried again! What a well written beautiful beautiful book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Enjoyed the storyline.  Great graphics.  Puzzles were medium challenge.  Speaking characters instead of lots of reading which is always a plus.  Ran smoothly without an glitches.  And priced fairly for length of game.  Would enjoy more games like it.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The movie and characters were incredible. Charlize is mesmerizing!!! Kristen Stewart is a poor actress with no facial expressions... I felt as if she was reading from cue cards. Hemsworth was broken and flawed but was full of life... I liked the movie but KS is boring...
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|did not here much about this movie.was not a copy of a Ahnuld 's  movie but written with the short story in mind.very entertaining.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|THIS BOOK IS OKAY, BUT I REALLY COULD NOT GET INTO.  MAYBE YOU WILL LIKE IT.  GIVE IT A TRY
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George R.R. Martin has created the epic saga of this day and age. Every chapter starts off exciting and original. This book sucks you in and doesn't let go.<br />Even though I watched the show first the way Martin writes is so cleverly descriptive you feel as if you have a full picture to the scene  without the use of bloat words.<br /><br />A must read
B004X80QNG|1.0|This used to be a great app , thiey screwed it up when the forced me to have to log into the Amazon app store everytime I want to use the app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It has a great sense of developing sharper minds by having to notice different places to put a certain card. It also helps train minds to have better strategic computations.
0452287022|5.0|This book arrived promptly and in excellent condition. I ordered this book for our book club read and would recommend it to other book clubs.
B00A757EFW|1.0|This game is exactly what I spent on it.... NOTHING don't waste your time unless you're gonna buy the full version
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Haven't put this game down since I started playing.  I love hidden object games but this is so much more than I expected. Just purchased full game so let me get back to playing.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like this book better than the other ones but it seemed shorter than the other boooks i would rate this a 5
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Our family's two favorites:  \\"Little drops of rain\\" and \\"Do you hear the people sing\\" are not on the CD.
B00364K6YW|1.0|I rated it one star because the last disc in the set did not work. I watched 4 hours of the movie and couldn't watch the ending. I love this movie it's one of my all time favorites. Very disappointing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One if my all time favorite books! Fun to read and I couldn't wait to see how it ended.  The only disappointing part is that that was the final book.  I enjoyed the entire trilogy.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book was OK.  I got into the characters and it was fun reading it.  But I was very disappointed in the ending.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a great book!  Fun to read and really got into the characters. Read it so fast!  I couldn't put it down!
B00914JWSW|3.0|We liked a few of the songs, but the others leave something to be desired.  The quality of the CD was excellent, with Barbra's voice coming through crystal clear.  Not her best CD.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great solitaire game. would recommend it to you, my fans.  e dawg has spoken.  now, down load this app and enjoy.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved this book. It had a lot more drama than the first and it kept me wanting to read more and more
B008M36EEI|5.0|Did not know how this movie would be, but was pleasantly surprised! It had underlying themes to globalization and a reasoning to bring people together.
0345803485|1.0|Being a publisher and a three-time best selling author myself, I was intrigued with the hype.  I FINALLY finished the first book this evening and I am so glad it's over.  The typo's were the main distraction for me.  I am dumbfounded how a \\"big publishing house\\" can allow so many typo's to pass through.  Do they even allow the author to read the final edits before it goes to print?  I am a fan of erotica and I believe those who find this book so \\"fabulous\\" most likely haven't read any erotica before this.  One scene in the book that sticks out in my head is Christian pulling out Ana's tampon.  THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT SHOULD NOT BE WRITTEN!  That is not sexy AT ALL!  After I read that, I was totally uninterested in the rest of the book, but pushed through it because I always finish what I start. Anyway, this review is coming from a professional, and I thought it was absolutely horrible, and I believe the only reason the book became a hit is because of the author's connections in the media world.  After all, she is or was a television executive in the U.K.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I purchased this for my girlfriend and she loves it. It does fit snug so be patient with it but it is good that it is snug.
1401937268|4.0|Gave as a gift..The angel tarot cards makes gift giving easy just when you don't know what to give .
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|this game can only br fully enjoyed if you spend a small fortune, they may say its free but this IS NOT A FREE game
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|The premise of the movie was a great idea. The follow through a little less than desired. But it passed the time. My only real problem was that I kept thinking of Brian the dog from Family Guy every time the bear talks. If you got time to kill this will do it
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Nothing can top A Christmas Carol! I do not know of a story that could out do this one. It is a wonderful book about faith and salvation. The fact that it is still being read today is proof of that! It is also a story people know by heart and there have been countless productions of it ( with the most accurate surprisingly being A Muppet's Christmas Carol). Everyone should read this at least once in their lifetime.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|I received quickly and played without any issues with the dvd.  The subject matter is rather intriquing and would recommend to others.  Especially as it involves christmas time--it was nice to see how people can come together for a common cause.
B008AX18Y6|5.0|Whilst a great fan of Rushdie's, I always find I have to work very hard to get through his books.  Often too many characters and too many words.  I thought that him writing this in the third person was very clever as it seemed as though he waas writing this &#34;outside' himself. It illuminated the level of bigotry in the world of Islam and how the Koran gives them licence to terrorrize the world.  I did at some point in the book think that it was &#34;all about him&#34; but now understand his stance on Freedom of speech - the Freedom of writing and the Freedom of reading.  I applaud anyone who is prepared to suffer the isolation he underwent for such a worthy principle.  Found it difficult to put down!
B001RHPJBU|5.0|What can I say?  It's phil collins!  great add to any collection and now I have it too. Please don't make people write more than they want to on these
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Right from the beginning I found myself rooting for Megan and Connor. And as it continued I found myself simply happy to read every page this story had to offer.
B0055SJVPW|5.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. I'd rather stab myself in the eye and/or ear drum than have to sit through it again.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies. So I love that I have it DVD now, even though it is such a cheesy 80's movie.
B0049VZ222|2.0|I liked this game for one time through, but it doesn't continue.  You reach a point where it has to start over, and the scenario does not change. Glad it was free, so I didn't feel bad deleting it!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Another page turner by Ken Follett!  He has several stories going on at once and there entwined as usual.  The rise and fall of Nazis is the idea behind the book.  He does a wonderful job sorting fact and fiction making the reader choose for themselves.  The violence was a bit disturbing since it reads like you are watching the scene.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you love animals, like animals, or have ever seen an animal, you will find this book  book interesting and heart-warming.  I absolutely loved the viewpoint of the  dog, I'm glad an author chose to have a pet as the narrator. The story was excellent and intense a lot of times.  I would  recommend this  book by highly to everyone.
0743270754|5.0|Yes, Teams of Rivals is the Abraham Lincoln story, which by itself is one the most most interesting, gripping political and human story you can ever read about.  However, Team of Rivals is so much more than that.  Throught Lincoln, Doris Kearns Goodwin draws a clear, enlightning portrait of William Seward, Kate and Salmon Chase, Edwin Stanton, Monty Blair and Ed Bates.<br /><br />Almost any scholar of the Civil War period, almost any American will agree that Abraham Lincoln was one of the most important person who ever influence the course of US history, surely one of the 3 best American President who ever lived, if not the Greatest.  What I realized going through Doris Kearns Goodwin marvelous work was that William Seward deserved a very high place on the list of the most important American politicians.  Surely way more influencial, more credible than most presidents, Seward was the ancor on which Lincoln rest, he was the friend, the confident, the essential advisor on which he rely.<br /><br />Without the unselfish secretary of state Seward, Abraham Lincoln may not have been able to get through his first mandate, he may not have been able to leave his footprints on mankind's history. So, my sincere thanks to the author, who made me realize than the Civil War period was much more than Ulysses Grant, more than Robert E Lee, more than Abraham Licoln, more that George McClelland. The Civil War era was also where William Seward shone his brightest.
B0037VNX44|4.0|Worth watching one time. I dont think I could tolerate the music again, and the ending just left you hanging. Also would have been nice to see pictures of the real Bronson at the end.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Like the facebook feature on the Kindle Fire.  Did have a little trouble setting up the Kindle to get on the web though.  Had to get some assistance to get that accomplished.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|By far the best book I have ever read. I Love the fifty shades of grey series.  The books have a amazing love story.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I chose this rating because I loved  the book because it really related to me but with out the smoking and party's and I know how he felt in the beginning of the book having no friends cause most of the people I call friends aren't friends and my real friends are so like Sam and Patrick because they don't fit in as well
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is a very exciting return to the world of Percy Jackson and is a heart pumping book of action
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Liked it and would read more from this author.  Good enough storyline to keep it interesting. Read it within a week.

B005LAII8K|5.0|Great movie - love the ending. Had not seen at theaters but heard a lot of good word of mouth on it. took a chance and it paid off.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|This book relates interesting research and study of the art of memorization and the history of brain capability.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  There is much about memorization, and it's intense followers, of which I was unaware.
B00321GTJU|5.0|One of the best nature programs i have seen in a while. Beautifully shot and just amazing to look at. Amazon instant video is very easy to use.
B0010T3UUM|2.0|I did not like this style at all, they made my feet feel moist, cold and uncomfortable all day long.
0062127241|3.0|Honestly, Pete's lyrics and music provide more meaningful, intelligent insight into his life than this book. It's truly what reveals his soul, in my opinion.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Hilarious.  My wife and I loved this movie.  I wish we would have purchased it instead of just renting it.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I loved this book.  Lots of suspense and humor.  John and Kate have a great relationship based on action, adventure, and a sense of humor in extremely dangerous situations.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|bought for my daughter for christmas and it arrived in a very good timely manor I would recommend this :)
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is the &#34;best guitarist you've never heard of&#34; but fortunately he is beginning to be recognized, as he should be.  This album is all around Good!
B007EECSFA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Never having read anything  by Kate Morton previously, I was a little hesitant, but found it took hold of my interest and kept it throughout the book.  It was really well-crafted even with all the movement back and forth in time the story held together very well.  The surprise ending was just the icing on the cake.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|What ca I say - love this to death.  If you know Passion Pit then you know what I'm talking 'bout.  If not, get going!
B005LAIISU|4.0|As entertaining as usual.  Good family film.  Granny was the most entertaining.  Wanda Sykes always kills me with her portrayals.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Love the OTR, and the selections within each genre. I like that the current program is shown on the link so you can see what you are clicking into
B005LAII12|2.0|Was disappointed with this movie.  Sorry, but I guess I wasn't in the mood for the type of humor is used.  Guess it wasn't the Christmas miracle I expected.
B008ALA6DW|3.0|I'm not sure if it's just my Retina Macbook, but the adapter fits relatively loose in the thunderbolt port causing the connection to drop if it gets jostled. This makes it kind of difficult to maintain a connection with the laptop on my lap (although it's fine on a table/desk). While the connection is steady, it works fine and transfers at gigabit speeds. I'd personally rather have a reliable connection through USB (as the ports seem more snug and are larger, making them more resilient to strain from the weight of my cat6 cable) but so far I can't find a USB 3.0 gigabit adapter.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Very good in concept and production.  I enjoyed the extras, but wonder how much more the Batman franchise can produce in quality in the future.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was such a good book.  Heartwrenching at times.  At first it felt like the characters were a little too grown up for high school, but then again, they were in their senior year and had been through quite a bit in life.  Very tough subject matter in this book.  I really liked how there is detail so you can begin to understand what the character went through, but not super graphic detail.  Great book!
0525478817|5.0|I don't use perfect lightly.  I am an adult, and the two best books I have read in the last few years are about teenagers (Black Swan Green is the other; read that one too).  I want everyone to read and love this book.  The scene where Hazel and Augustus first meet is the best, most honest description of the onset of falling in love.  I just finished and I feel inclined to stop reviewing it and go read it again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have loved this game since I was a small child. Thank you Kindle for having it here. Now I can play anytime I want.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is THE best performance on a DVD I have ever seen. I can watch it over and over again so it is well worth the money spent for so many hours of enjoyment. The singing is SUPERB and the finale is quite simply breath-taking!!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It was funny but somehow for what ever reason, I was expecting more.  It was good for a free rental.
0062197266|5.0|Summary<br /><br />Catherine meets Lee.  He's exciting, sexy, drop dead gorgeous...and dangerous.  By the time Catherine realizes she's in trouble, it's too late.  Lee has infiltrated her friends, and no one believes her.  She has to get away from him...but how.  If she fails, she knows he'll kill her.<br />Fast forward three years.<br />Cathy has changed her name and is in hiding, suffering from a serious case of OCD as a result of the psychological and physical trauma she experienced in her relationship with Lee.  As she takes real steps to overcome her condition, Lee is released from prison.  Is he watching her?  Or is it another hallucination?<br />How does she continue making progress dealing with irrational threats...if her most feared threat may actually be rational?<br />Hold on to your seats.<br /><br />What I Liked<br /><br />The time shifts...back and forth between present and past.  At first I wasn't sure if I would like it or not, but I ended up really enjoying the break in the tension...a chance to shift from just a thriller to the analysis of the thrill...if that makes any sense at all.<br /><br />LOVE that Stuart is a psychologist...so perfect to see not just the clinical side of Cathy's issues but the personal as well...with someone who can truly support and understand her.<br /><br />It's no spoiler that the villain of this novel is Lee...and let me tell you, he is a villain of all villains...I have caught myself many times wondering why women who are battered stay with their abusers.  Lee is an extreme (I hope) example of why, but I sure get it now.  Shivers.<br /><br />Cathy is a brash young woman on her own...she gets herself into a mess...a HUGE one...but then she works incredibly hard to survive and go on with her life.  At first I judged her.  She spends a lot of time partying...and partying hard.  But, later in the novel her whole puzzle comes together and I could see how she might have unconsciously made choices that weren't the best.  The psychology, trauma, death, themes are imbedded throughout and paint a rich picture of how the human mind responds to certain events in life.<br /><br />The End - I didn't see it coming...and I did sneak a peek.<br /><br />Gives you just enough information just at the right times...there are just enough twists and turns to keep your mind active and then the holes get filled in at just the right times.<br /><br />The vivid descriptions of panic attacks and Cathy's \\"checking\\" routines.  These are very obviously written by someone who knows and understands the psychology behind them.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like<br /><br />Lee - Dear young women everywhere, #1 Any man who seems too good to be true...probably is. #2 If a guy you just met sets off your common sense alarm, turn the other way and run like hell.<br /><br />Cathy's friends - supposedly these characters were Cathy's best, lifelong friends, yet they constantly engaged in dangerous behaviors and encouraged her to join them (which she did of her own free will), but when the time came to support her, none of them followed through.  Who needs enemies with friends like this?<br /><br />Overall Recommendation<br /><br />If narratives that delve into mental illness, panic attacks, domestic abuse, fear...both irrational and rational, psychotic boyfriends, psychology and young adult life in London interest you at all, this is your next read.psychology, trauma, death, themes are imbedded throughout and paint a rich picture of how the human mind responds to certain events in life.<br /><br />The End - I didn't see it coming...and I did sneak a peek.<br /><br />Gives you just enough information just at the right times...there are just enough twists and turns to keep your mind active and then the holes get filled in at just the right times.<br /><br />The vivid descriptions of panic attacks and Cathy's \\"checking\\" routines.

B000P0J09W|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and still do as an adult. It’s a great story about adventure with comedy. I usually don’t purchase movies but this one is a good one worth watching more than once.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was not sure about reading these series. There was so much hype. But I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the books. We even bought the first movie. Can't wait for the other movies to come out.

030758836X|4.0|i've read gillian flynn's other two novels and given the ad frenzy over the positive reviews of the book (entertainment weekly seemed to go overboard a little, c'mon), the book seemed like an obvious read for me. if you've read either or both of her previous novels you know that by now, flynn's stories carry a certain tone or frequency to them. this book fit the dark mold she's created for her writing world. it was written well and i got sucked in, but...by the end of it (and without spoiling it, i didn't care for the ending) i felt like i had been manipulated by the writer. yes, the game of a writer is to manipulate their reader and hit certain beats to create the emotional response necessary to invest the reader to the end. there was just something different about this one that didn't quite sit well with me.  when i put the book down i felt maybe amy and gillian are a little more similar than i'd like to believe.  i'm less likely to read her next novel because of all this.  unless she writes something fun (i know, a stretch) about tanner bolt.  he was awesome.

B004WIOCH8|4.0|much better then the film released to theaters.  the extras that had to be cut to make a pg-13 movie made this film tell a much better story about DareDevil.  i enjoyed this movie a lot more.
0307744434|2.0|When I first read the description of this book I thought, 'that is very interesting and wouldn't mind giving it a shot', but as I started reading The Night Circus I got bored REALLY quickly.<br /><br />A few reasons why I just could not finish this book were:<br /><br />1) It was too slow for my liking<br /><br />- Granted, I don't really mind slow books but this one was slower than the tortoise trying to win the race with the hare. I try reading enough to see what happens but not much does in the beginning of the book. I was expecting something of a BOOM! POW! kind of action but all it really was was a father who tortured his own daughter to build up her powers and make them stronger and an adopted orphan who was told to read, read, read all day. Nothing really much happens.<br /><br />2) It was just confusing<br /><br />- Each chapter was dated in different times, meaning, some would be present day and the next chapter would be two months later and next would about four years ago and this progressed widely throughout the entire book. If the dates were all placed in chronological order then I wouldn't mind but you just couldn't keep track of what date it was now and what it was a few pages ago.<br /><br />3) The characters were confusing<br /><br />- Although, some characters were seemingly interesting but some... I just couldn't see the point of adding them to the book. It could be because I have not gone far enough into the book to understand these reasons but a few of them seemed pointless. Especially with each chapter. One chapter it would be one person (one who had only been mentioned a handful of times) then the next would be someone else and the next someone, just like with the dates.<br /><br />4) The competition seemed pointless<br /><br />- What's the point of this competition again? For two men's enjoyment? Although this competition has been going on for years, the two main characters, Celia and Marco (who they do not know they are competing with, didn't know much about it until they were practically adults, and were told that they had to be ready when the time comes... When is that time?). I just don't see the real point in this competition.<br /><br />5) The love interests, just without the love<br /><br />- Still waiting for the love in 'magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands' moment! Nothing much has happened besides one or two words were ever spoken to each other.<br /><br />All in all, I really wanted to be swept away in this magical tale but I just couldn't finish it and I was disappointed in that.know much about it until they were practically adults, and were told that they had to be ready when the time comes...

B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie as I could totally relate to the routine we can tend to get in when married for a long time.  I thought the acting by both of them was superb.  I didn't expect a comedy since I had been forewarned so there wasn't that disappointment that many others had.
1423101502|5.0|Loved the series, and hope to purchase more books, really enjoyed reading this.  Thanks for a good book!  Enjoyed !
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|its so fun.I like to play it after school or when I get board at home. in I think a lot of people will like it.
B001JRB16U|5.0|A classic that even my grand children love to watch. I wasn't quit sure why there were two discs as it was not explained very well in the on line description. It just has short stuff and some other things I had no interest in. It was a very reasonable priced so no big deal about the second disc.
B004MYFV0O|5.0|This is a great book for those who want to draw and don't know where to start. The book covers basics and moves on to more advanced lessons. The instruction covers important art concepts in an entertaining way. You'll be drawing from the first lesson and improving with each one as long as you practice.<br /><br />You'll eventually have to learn to apply these methods to drawing things that you see around you, but for a starter book on drawing, you can't go wrong with this one.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Definitely not my cup of tea! Quit after a few chapters. I'm not a prude, but it was off the scale bad
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Its a must see!! Got to see!!! Have to see!! The first part of the movies is slow, but gets interesting!
1451696191|4.0|Well, for those of you who came here to read a polite story about flowers, let me clarify that this is not the polite story of a flower seller or something like that. I came to this story after several of my friends had read it. I'd been looking for a story I could identify with, and I was surprised to find it in an author I had never heard of before. Don't let that stop you from reading this though, this really is a great novel. Stephen Chbosky creates a story that can help high school students get through the rough moments of life.<br /> Perks of Being a Wallflower is the story of a 9th grader named Charlie who starts his school year with hardly any friends. Soon he befriends a teacher, Bill, and two seniors, Sam and Patrick. Sam and Patrick help guide Charlie socially as he learns more about the troubles of teenage life from drugs to sex to alcohol. The story is brutally honest throughout and ends in a satisfying way.<br /> At the beginning you may be thrown back a little by the simplicity in the writing style of Stephen Chbosky, yet I can promise you that as you continue to read, it won't even matter. The simple nature helps give the story personality and allows you to fully understand the character of Charlie. There may not be many similes or metaphors, but the characters in this novel are more alive than almost anything I've ever read.<br /> You should read this novel if you've just entered High School, and you need something that will make you feel like someone else has had a hard time just like you have because this novel presents you with one of the most alive groups of characters ever presented in a novel. Be warned though, if you're a person who has a hard time reading stories where bad things happen to people, I would avoid this because you may not be ready to handle some of the things that happen in the story. For those of you who decide to read, I don't think you'll be disappointed. I highly recommend this story.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is a great book. I thought initially that it was going to be just a normal romance which I'm in the mood for this week, but then comes the drama.....it was a nice change for me. Nice read.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|please make it faster because it took 2 hours to get half way done and I barely used any memory for apps otherwise its a good game when I played at my friends
B009JBWOU0|4.0|3 great movies, great cover and for a good price. This is a must if you like the movie franchise.  The only thing is that the digital version cannot be saved on the computer or iPad.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use it several times a week. It has many features that allow me to plan out the next few days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever way better then temple run and will always be the best ever. I know subway surfers will always be the flippin best!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Simply perfect. It was a book that was so informal yet so elegant. I'm glad to have had the privilege of reading it.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was a little skeptical when I bought this for my Kindle.<br />I was on a long flight over the Christmas holidays and decided to look at it.<br />I was hooked!<br />Couldn't wait for my connecting flight so I could read again.<br />It's always interesting when a man of science writes a book like this, because they always pooh pooh belief in God, but not this one.<br />I recommend this to all my friends.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Worked well on my poor disabled HP TX2000. The original thermal paste was practically all gone. (Because of the cheap thing used by HP, it fried a gpi, had to reassemble and change the paste all by myself, nobody here even wants to fix these HP series.)<br /><br />Oh well, this product is worth its price and one of the best in its own league. PC works quietly and cools off quickly. Sure satisfied.
B000GJ0KOG|5.0|This film was recommended by a co-worker.  It was hard to find, but I did find it and ordered it.  I really enjoyed watching this film.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I loved the movie. Was intrigued to have 3 characters from Inception in this movie as well. It was good seeing them in different roles and obviously able to work well together!!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King create a marvellous story with an excelent description of the past and wildly imaginative that you won't stop reading it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  And I can't wait to read the next book.  I am surprised at the ending, as I thought it would end differently.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|A very good read. I enjoyed this book but not as much as the first. Good pace and the book kept me entertained at all times.
B001S86J5S|5.0|This movie has so many great scenes and one liners. If you are a fan of this film, this is the best version you can currently own on home video. It's currently at $12 but the price is most always fluctuating so I'd wait until it's under $10.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Heard about this book from a friend and I really got into it. Could not wait to get home from work and read
B003V1WTMM|5.0|To read an almost 600 page book in two days takes either a lot of free time or an incredibly compelling plot.  I started this book thinking it would keep me company for the first few weeks of my retirement.  WRONG!  I couldn't put it down even to the point of reading it while watching the Ravens/Colts playoff game at the same time.  Not sure how I managed to do both but I did.  It's very hard to go into details without creating a spoiler but suffice to say, I didn't see the ending coming at all, despite having read many novels set in the 1930's and '40's in Europe (most recently \\"The Time in Between\\"...another great book).  It's not too often that the narrator draws you in and makes his/her story your story.  This is my second Kate Morton novel...really looking forward to reading others.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|Again, great series and could not wait to read it. Sorry to see some of the characters go. Can not wait to read the next book
0307949486|4.0|Having read the rave reviews for this book, the slow beginning surprised me. I felt there was too much exposition and unnecessary details to thread through that made me wonder how the book became an international bestseller. That said, once disgraced, journalist Mikael Blomkvist and security, researcher Lisbeth Salander meet and team-up to solve the 40-year-old murder mystery, the book becomes the page-turner I'd expected, keeping me up until the early hours. I still found Mikael Blomkvist a little dull and weak as a main character, maybe because he had to compete with the brilliant, kick-ass, computer hacker Lisbeth Salander. Since I know she appears in the next two books, I'm definitely on board for the rest of the Millennium trilogy.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A very good read. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Excellent characters. Good pace and the book kept me entertained at all times.

B004AP9W46|5.0|I have had this book for more than 10 years and wore my paperback copy to tatters. This is easily one of my favourite stories of all time. When the pages started falling out I finally decided to purchase for kindle. Just to ensure I always have a copy if I want to read it again.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Great deal, quick shipping, and an amazing movie what else can you ask for? Very please with this purchase and if you are an X-Men fan you will really enjoy this edition to the series.
0345803507|2.0|I get that sex sells but so does a good plot beyond the obvious. The author should try expanding the vocabulary used in the book. Same old thing every time.......
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|My dad is a big sci-fi fan, so movies such as Logan's Run are always a great gift. Plus he doesn't understand &#34;the whole blu-ray thing&#34; so it is a great deal buying standard DVD's.
0345803493|2.0|A bit more plot beyond the sex then the first book so it was mildly more interesting. Went right on to number three and there I am stuck.... To far in the series not to finish it, but sooooooo boring I can't get through it.
B009G3T01M|5.0|Like many other people, I was drawn to this album by the whimsical fun of Thrift Shop and the heart-warming sincerity of Same Love.  I was delighted to discover that every song on this impressive album hits the mark.  Clever, sincere, honest- listening to Macklemore rap feels more like having a heart to heart with a close friend.  Can't recommend it enough!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love it, good for the brain and very challenging for the entire family,i like how it is put together and i love the levels
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|absolutely terrible, and I am a fan of Family Guy by Seth MacFarlane! Mark Wahlberg is less-than-charming, the storyline is bad, and its far too long. Mila Kunis was, as usual, cute anf funny.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i can now drive and listen to someone read a good word to me and i feel so less stressed with traffic and all
0679809015|4.0|cute book, my daughter loves the flaps, but its really tiny! was expecting it to be a bit larger, but its great for the diaper bag.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|We felt cheated out of a Bourne movie!! In no way was this even close to &#34;good&#34;!  Where was the smart writing, where was the action, chase scenes (until the end..and then they made up time and it was 20 min.!) and where was BOURNE?
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|My wife and I watched this with great anticipation from all the hype. We just didn't get it, which is surprising as we enjoy watching a lot of movies from all different genres.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie was very interesting.  Take it as entertainment and do  not try to figure out where he would be, what effects what because of time travel and you will be entertained
B009X01GJ2|4.0|Love the case. Is very sturdy and comfortable to use. Is nice to be able to adjust my Kindle for reading without having to hold it. The one design flaw I have found is that there is no opening to allow charging while the case is closed. Is not a big deal but would definitely be an advantage.
0316098515|5.0|This book was a gift to our grandson who is a line chef at a restaurant in Baltimore.  From the time he opened the book we could hardly get him to talk with us again!  It was a hit....
B001P5M7QE|4.0|Got it as a streaming video, so it is now part of my library and I can watch it anytime, from a variety of platforms/devices.  Good video and audio quality.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was the grand finale and it was that hardest of the 3 to get through but it wrapped everything up in as good a way as I could've imagined it
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I love the Scarpetta books, but Cornwall is becoming a little to liberal in her views.  Haven't been able to get into this one.
B005BCE7FQ|2.0|I rated this movies because I cannot play it on my LG BP325 3D Blu Ray player, it's made for Region B. How do unlock my player to play all disc regions. Please help alasys@msn.com
0345529057|5.0|Next to Tolkien and Lewis, best fantasy writer ever. I can't say enough good things about Martin, but he creates amazing characters and an engaging wonderful world.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Great music and I love all of the artists.  Hope you come out with a second one for next season!
B001P06GX4|5.0|My daughter recommended this board game to me as she played it at school. My mom (81 yo), my husband and me all love it. It is easy to learn (very simple rules) but very interesting to play (involves some geometry).
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|It was so stupid it felt really awkward to be watching it at times. If we didn't have friends over I would have turned it off. Turns out  our friends also thought it was stupid.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am too old and too married to have a crush on a character in a story..but I do. What an . Awesome trilogy. I wish it wasn't over!!!  Fell in love with the story line and the characters. This is like nothing I've ever read before.
B009FZFONO|5.0|My husband and I really like this show. The picture is also really good when we were streaming it online through amazon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was bound & determined that I was not going to like The Hunger Games Trilogy so why bother reading the books or watching the movie......  Then I got a Kindle for Christmas & decided, \\"What the heck?\\"  I started to read the first book & could NOT put it down.  It was a very easy read & held my attention with such vivid detail that I felt as if I actually knew what District 12 was like & what the characters looked like.  I finished the first book in just a couple of days & then borrowed the second book immediately.  I had it read in 2 or 3 days also - would have been less time, but the family wanted to eat!  Can't wait to begin the final book & see what happens for the finale!!
1419705849|5.0|If your kids enjoy the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series they will love this. All my boys, ages 7-13, read this book before Christmas Break was over. Good product and worth the cost.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|First time reader of Mira Lyn Kelly.  I definitely enjoyed her writing style.  Just couldn't' put this one down. Enjoyable.
0375842209|1.0|...to make the Angel of Death during WWII absolutely mind-numbingly boring. Clearly the author thinks he's being clever and deep, and it just comes across as pretentious and tedious. The main character has no redeeming features. It uses every WWII cliche imaginable. The use of random German words in dialogue (right before typing the exact same word in English mind you) got really annoying really fast. It was poorly paced and poorly written.<br /><br />This was a horrible book. It actually made me root for the Nazis in the hopes they'd come and take Liesal and her dull supporting cast away. If I could give this zero stars, I would.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Wakeing Up Married--A slow cute book for a rainy day----not a lot of unexpected surprises- kind of predictable- but worth the read.
1582701709|5.0|those looking for an introduction to the Law of Attraction and the concept of deliberately creating your own life experience. It is very easy to read, very easy to understand and introduces the readers to all the basic ideas and principles around The Law of Attraction.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|downton abbey<br /><br />5 stars because the show is amazing.<br />only problem, the show would switch between hd & non-hd periodically through out the episode.<br />i suppose this would only really be noticed when watching on an HD television
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved the Fifty Shades series. Can't wait for more from this author! This is a series I could easily read again and still enjoy.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|As a Big Led Zeppelin fan, I am both surprised & pleased with Celebration Day.. Surprised at how<br /> well Jason Bonham did filling his dad's shoes ( John Bonham ).. Kinda bummed that the song Celebration Day wasn't included in the set.. Disappointed with Jimmy Page for not including that song but, callin the set Celibration Day.. Other wise great CD/BR set.. Long Live Led Zeppelin.. Robert Jelgersma
0857201700|5.0|This is book is a perfect mate to The Secret and a nice continuation of the introduction to the Law of Attraction. Would recommed to anyone just starting to investigate.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the series, it was hard to get through book 1 but if you can push through, the rest is worth it. As a wife of someone who was brought up with similar trauma, I highly recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|my kids love to play ice age village. my only knock on it is just like all these games the acorns are a rare commodity. they almost force you to buy them. but if you are very patient you can still enjoy the game
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the series, it was hard to get through book 1 but if you can push through, the rest is worth it. As a wife of someone who was brought up with similar trauma, I highly recommend it.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|This was a fantastic movie!!  From start to finish, the aesthetics and scenery had shades of Blade Runner throughout the film.  The idea behind 'The Fall' was very clever.  The technology of that time period was clever, well implemented, and had me wanting to throw my money at the television set.  Colin Farrell is superb, and the characters were all well portrayed.  His wife was an incredible actress as well.  I won't offer up any spoilers.  This is nothing like the original Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  If you like SCI-FI, and a great military covert ops flick rolled into one, this film is for you!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was a fantastic book and movie, absolutely loved them both!  There were parts that made me cry and then some parts made me laugh till I cried, it was awesome.  I would definitely tell anyone to first read the book and then watch the movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So great! I haven't read in awhile and now I just want to keep reading! This book is just inspiring!
0446547654|5.0|Nicholas Sparks can't wite a bad book so you might know this would be very good.  Here again the romantic side of me comes out and I loved the story line.
B000XVSU9O|4.0|I have not yet started reading this book but it was recommended to me by a freind because of an experience I had.  She said there was one part that was odd but she thought I could relate to the rest of the book.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|What can I say, don't we all love Whitney Housten and Kevin Costner?  This had always been one of my favorites but had never bought it but when Whitney passed on I figured I better!  I could watch this once a week or more.
B0086700CM|3.0|mostly got for my daughter.she loves it but its just an ok game for me.i like card games more than adventure.
0790733226|5.0|brilliant thankyou it was exerlent service arrived on time love this film so much so glad to have it back
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is an outstanding look into the character of one of America's finest leaders as seen through the eyes of those who knew him best.  It is an incredibly detailed and fascinating book.  Part of Lincoln's greatness lay in his ability to understand human nature and to empathize with others.  He had a remarkable ability to forgive slights and attacks and to reward those who had wronged him according to their abilities and not their treatment of him.  In addition, he would accept the blame for the fault and shortcomings of the men he appointed to high positions.  All of these characteristics worked together to guide the United States through the most difficult time in its history.  He was truly a great man and richly deserves to be revered for preserving the Union.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW!  This is the best book I have read in the most recent three months.  It is elequently written and honestly moving.  A must read!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Read this book!  It is so beautifully written and will make you<br /> laugh, cry and want to read it again.  I was a little hesitant<br /> to read it at first, but so glad I did.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Although the translation was a bit difficult to follow at times, the intrigue was continuous throughout all three of the books.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|Note: I have the Google Play version, not the Amazon version.<br /><br />I've tried many white noise options. My husband snores and all the noises in the house wake me up as I'm a light sleeper. I now play this app every night when I'm sleeping and it really helps mask those noises. The biggest pet peeve about most white noise apps is that you can hear where the track repeats. There's either a break in the sound, or the sound is so short that you notice it playing the same pattern over and over. That's not the case with Lightning Bug. I've tried with many different tracks to find where it repeats and I've never been able to find it. I don't know how they do it, but I do know that I love it.<br /><br />I also love the ability to customize what sounds are playing. You can select which noises you want to hear and for the ones that are sporadic (such as a train horn, birds, etc), you can select a range when they will randomly play. So if I want the train horn to play more frequently, I might select a range from 30 - 60s. Then for the birds, I could select 200-250s or something longer. (Those aren't exact numbers from the app, just an example to give you an idea.)<br /><br />The app also has sound packs available for download to create even more options. Some are free and some are an extra charge, but since they are such great quality, I think they're worth it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a white noise app, I highly recommend Lightning Bug!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I rated this book with 5 stars because, as soon as I finished (& wiped the tears from my eyes!), I was ready to read it again. This book is happy, sad, sexy, & just awesome.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|So far so good on making another epic part to the story... Love that they kept mostly all the same actors from the first one
B000FVQLRA|4.0|I would like to give a 4 1/2 Star it keep my attention the whole movie! I will keep looking at it many times
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I think this is totally bogus. I LOVE this game and play it on the computer all the time and was totally stoked to see I could get it on my kindle. I paid for it and went to install it and kept on getting error error error every time. I'm so ticked!!!!!
B00005QB42|5.0|Love her music...the whole thing...thank you!!  I'd heard the first song played at one of my Yoga classes and knew I had to have this music...shipped very quickly and love, love, love it!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Like all the previous Batman movies by Christopher Nolan, this one is awesome. Compared to the Batman movies of 1980's and 1990's, there is a lot of focus on the character of Batman, and his philosophy, not to mention the great special effects and advanced gadgets!
B004YRSBTW|5.0|Great acting. Great concept. It's a thinker so if you don't like to be challenged in a movie don't watch it. If you do like thinkers, watch this right away.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I say five stars because this is perfect for me and my family and friends so I love it<br />alot
B0093COK4S|5.0|If you like 80s music and trance music, you'll like this cd. It features great Sandra's voice with great trance mix from B&J. It's great!
B003LSTK8G|3.0|I wish I had know it was the collapse of the housing market from two different perspectives.  There is a movie about the same subject that is much easier to understand.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this solitaire it is addicting. kind of like I know I can get it the next time. well worth your time
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|The movie, overall, was pretty dark but the ending was a surprise and it was a very different movie from the typical so that made it interesting.  The language was pretty rough so I would go into it knowing that for sure.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am a happy fan of John Green, via he and his brothers YouTube videos. I bought this on his suggestion, hoping that it would deliver. It most certainly did. Before today, I would have been hard pressed to believe that a healthy adult man could so unbelievably pose as a dying sixteen year old girl, but there you have it.
0316056863|5.0|Tina Fey's \\"Bossypants\\" was amazing. I've always been a fan of Tina Fey since the moment I was introduced to her. Her humor speaks right to my soul, and I can completely resonante with the humor she writes with.<br /><br />I honestly didn't know what to expect with this book, though. I felt like she was too young for a memoir, and I was slightly afraid of it being a comedian book since I usually don't like those. However, her book was a perfect balance of life lessons, experiences, advice, thoughts, etc. The list goes on. I personally love that a wide array of things are talked about, and that each part carries a light-heartedness to it that is impossible not to catch while reading.<br /><br />The book was extremely easy to read through. I finished it entirely in one day, which usually would bother me, but with her writing style, I honestly felt like I had just spent the whole day talking to a dear friend about the things in her life. I cried much more than once from laughter, but it was worth every single tear.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I loved the remixes and the one liners but it is a very simplistic and predictable movie.  Many teenagers will love it.
B00002SSKI|2.0|When I received this product the dvd case was cracked and for some reason the writing was in Spanish... very interesting
B008MEM24S|5.0|My son downloaded this one on his own while he was playing with my kindle... i've played it once or twice but he loves it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Action, adventure, love, and heartbreak.  This novel has lots of things going for it and can draw in all kinds and all ages of readers.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|Game took a very long time to download such a large file, then it wouldn't play. Deleted and uninstalled... very disappointed :(
0756407125|5.0|I love this series!  It is not often that I read a book that I just can't put down. I hope Rothfuss has a long career ahead of him.  If these books are any indication, he may be the next Orson Scott Card.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|hugs the iphone well. extra screen guard a plus, able to put pics in the back to customize, not too bulky, easy to remove and re insert. Con is that it may yellow over time.
B002APU580|4.0|I'm actually not of fan of Keira Knightley but she holds her own in this movie.  Great acting and the third main character is the scenery.  It was amazing to see.  This is another good rendition of the book so, if you like the book you'll like the movie, though honestly i had to do a bit of explaining to those who hadn't read the book.  Of course for those that speak an American English at times it can be a little difficult to understand the actors.  They speak really fast and mumble throughout the movie.
B004XQX4K0|5.0|The best of JavaScript reference. Has a lot of useful code snippets ready for implementation. The explanations are clear and easy to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! I was not sure if I'd like it, but I really enjoyed it.  I am excited to read the next one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved reading the series, sorry to see it end. :(  I read a few reviews and was afraid that they had spoiled the end for me, but they did not.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|I thought it was very good portrayal of the Spanish national hero.  The change in feelings of the characters through the movie was well acted and believable.  It was more accurate than I thought at first.  Some web sights, particularly of the muslim religion, change the facts of history and portray the invaders of Spain as the good guys and those who take it back from them as bad.  Don't let supposed historians convince you otherwise, the final ride was historically accurate except it occurred longer after El Cid died.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|I expected much less thus the 3 star effort.  Probably more like a 2 but my good deed for the day forced me to consider otherwise.
B00000DBXL|5.0|simple riffs but so melodic and cool lyrics! impressed of all tracks. been listened at least 50 times and still not boring me.
0517548232|5.0|Well written, concise book.  This is a good book for those who want to know about how economics works, particularly college students of economics.
B00A03WBVI|5.0|Digital delivery/downloads are excellent. My daughter was really wanting this and it is great. Instant gratification is a wonderful thing.
B001M3WPY8|5.0|This was much better than expected.  One of the best movies about medieval knights I have seen.  Recommend it to fans of knights.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I never write reviews but I just had to review this awesome book. After reading Colleen Hoover's 'Slammed' and 'Point of Retreat' I was instantly a fan of this authoe and could not wait until 'Hopeless' came out. And let me tell you, it did NOT disappoint!<br /><br />Beautifully written, deep story with the perfect characters (Sky & Holder were ahh-mazing together) and a compelling storyline that was such a page-turner. I seriously could not put the book down. Highly recommended!
0307719219|5.0|I recommend this book for those wanting to be learned on how nations come and go.  Those who forget the past are destined to relive it.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|As a fan of Mr. De Mille I must say that this novel was NOT his best work. Unfortunately while Mister De Mille's biting satirical wit as heard thru the voice of John Corey seems still in tact, the prose narrative repeats itself much too often and the story line never seems to get off the ground. I kept reading expecting a better story and instead was treated to more of the same. It seems to take John Corey and wife forever  to leave for Yemen, much less to engage with The Notorious Panther. If this had not been a Kindle book and if I had not read and enjoyed Mister De Mille previously I think I would not have finished this gruesome excursion into the Yemeni  culture.<br />I am afraid what happened here was an author in pursuit of a payday.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|This movie was fun.  It was neat filmography.  The actors were fun to watch.  They seemed to enjoy making the movie.
B0048IDRDM|5.0|Little needs to be said about this wonderful performance.  The four principals are all time greats.  I heard all four in their primes (including Price as Aida) and the recording captures their voices and art.  Vickers' voice in particular was not always captured well on recordings elsewhere.  Though not an Italian sound, he did have a ping which is captured here, and he used a huge voice with intellect and finesse.  He is indeed a heroic Rhadames.  Price is, of course definitive.  Merrill is a big, sonorous Amonosoro roaring over the orchestra.  His acting was sometimes criticized, but he is here a superb vocal actor.  Gorr's scene in denouncing the priests is incredible--her voice combined with Solti's conducting brings the scene to a tumultuous conclusion. Solti's conducting leans towards the dramatic, but there is plenty of lyricism in the Nile and Tomb Scenes.  To me, this recording blows away the other stereo versions I have (Domingo/Caballe, Domingo/Millo, Tebaldi/Bergonzi).  OK, so why the warning?  I already own this on vinyl and CD.  I bought this because two reviewers (one on Amazon and one elsewhere on the web) said this was a 24 bit remastering, and I wanted the very best sound for this treasured performance.  I do not believe this is the case.  In direct comparison, the sound on the two is virtually indistinguishable.  Generally, differences in remastered discs are easily discernible.  Comparing the waveforms on the computer showed no difference.  The copyright date is listed as 1987, the same as the previous issue.  Therefore, I doubt this is a remaster, and if so, unimproved sound.  Also, the previous three disc version does not force a disc change in the middle of an act as this version does and also has a libretto. Therefore, I would not recommend this if you have the previous version.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down!!! Heartbreaking, tragic, page turning & exciting all at once, similar Romeo & Juliet line.... great book!
0061743526|5.0|This classic book is dressed up like it deserves in this hardcover version with an anniversary dust cover.  A book like this is worth reading to the Grandkids or Great-Grandkids someday.  Buy a copy worth keeping - and this is it.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is about a boy born with the body of an old man. His father abandons him on the steps of a home for the elderly, and a care-taker takes him in as her own. Benjamin grows younger as time goes by, and just like anyone else, experiences things like love, loss, war, and death. The plot chiefly follows Benjamin's life, but the story contains a lot of interesting little pieces of other character's lives. It's sort of a study of people and their lives and how everything flows together.<br /><br />In between everything else, the film is a love story between Benjamin and Daisy, a young girl he met as an old man. Eventually, their ages meet in the middle, and they begin the relationship they've waited their whole lives to have. This premise might be a little bizarre and off-putting to some, but this is exactly the kind of strange love story, that I can appreciate.<br /><br />The film moves slowly and quietly. The effects in this movie are subtle, but that is exactly why they are impressive. Those looking for purely a great love story will get it... in time. But if you can appreciate a long, quiet movie about life, with a bit a quirk, this film may be for you. Just get your tissues ready.
0316228532|4.0|I bought this as a gift, and the person was very pleased.  I've heard several comments about how much they enjoy the story.  The binding is also very good and comfortable to read.
B003UAKE9Y|4.0|Coraline is a strange, darkly-tinted story of a girl moving into an old apartment building with her parents. Coraline starts off irritated with her new situation: her apartment is boring, her neighbors are bizarre, and her parents are negligent and obsessed with work. When Coraline dreams, she goes through a little door leading to a world, where her &#34;Other&#34; Mother and Father live, and everything she finds bad or boring in her real life becomes extraordinary. Each time she wakes up more frustrated with the real world, but eventually, she starts to find that something is off with the world behind the door.<br /><br />I've seen Coraline described as Alice in Wonderland meets The Nightmare Before Christmas, and I think that's a very fitting comparison, when talking about the story and visual style. This certainly has Tim Burton's signature style, which I always want to love, but I never quite feel like I &#34;get&#34;. Still, I do like Coraline for what it is. The visuals are quite cool and, sometimes, lovely, even in their strangeness. I have a great affinity for the music. I also love the story, which I'm guessing is mostly to Neil Gaiman's credit, though I've yet to read the book to see how closely the movie sticks to the original story.<br /><br />There are a few things to keep in mind if getting this movie for a child. It can be quite disturbing and scary at times, and if I had watched it at a young age, I think I'd be quite scared. The neighbors also put on a short play that seemed a little too sexual for a PG rating. Just look up the Miss Spink and Miss Forcible scene to see what I mean.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I cant stop playing this game! I take it everywhere I go so if i have some time I can play it.
0060853972|5.0|I don't often trust books written by two authors but in this case, the novel really showcases the best of both.  Enjoyable and well-written, I loved it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Not only is this a must-have app for Kindle readers, but it is one of my favorite apps for reading generic PDF files. I use it instead of the PDF reader.
B000002GYR|5.0|The recipient of this gift was very happy.  As the giver of the gift I was also very happy with the price and prompt delivery.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This free is app was all I needed to amuse me. Not a lot of instruction, but some good interactive play. For the price (free), you can't go wrong! I imagine that it will no longer be free by the time you read this, but if the price is fair, I would still recommend it.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|This was a gift and lived up to expectations--which were very high after reading (repeatedly) that this Dylan album was one of the best of 2012.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I got this when it was a free app, but even if I had to pay for it, I would still enjoy using this program to read the Bible. Other programs may have more study notes and additional features, but for a basic Bible reader, this one works!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Great book a little convoluted sometimes but all in all a great read for any true zombie fan. I can't wait and see how they try to make all these stories into one film.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|amazing. A great non-traditional start to a love story, one of which i've never heard before. This book was NOT predictable, and that's something that made it so great. I fell in love with these characters who made my jaw drop multiple times!, made me laugh, and most definitely made me cry. If you love to read love stories THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU. I can't wait to see the movie now!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is another great Mitch Albom novel!  Would highly recommend it to all!  Really made me think with lots of interesting ideas!

B0076DELIG|5.0|Really enjoyed this new Michael Connelly book!  One of his best Harry Bosch novels!  Lots of interesting twists that kept me on wondering what would happen next!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I was really curious how this book was going to go. I myself couldnt imagine it. But this book kept me interested for start to finish.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I didn't finish reading it yet, however the beginning is very good.<br />I am enjoying reading it on my new kindle.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I LOVE THE BOOK.  I WAS HOOKED RIGHT FROM THE FIRST PAGE.  THE CHARACTERS  WERE ALL SO UNIQUE. I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT ONE.
B007V65R54|5.0|An eye opener.  Readers of this should read the Black Swan by Nassim Nicolas Taleb.  Puts predicting into perspective.  Worth reading.
B005LAII08|5.0|My 4-year old niece wants to watch Brave every time she comes over, and I'm happy to oblige her because I enjoy it as much as she does!

B009A9BF5G|5.0|it was spectacular show, it was a nice movie specially for the one's who haven't see the band playing live
B005LAII80|5.0|Hollywood sci-fi action movies these days tend to have too many subplots, characters who act out of character, nonsensical character motivations, and swooshing CGI cartoonish action scenes. \\"Dredd\\", on the other hand, is a lean, mean, well-paced, well-acted, well-thought out, darkly funny non-stop escalation of movie violence. I've seen this movie multiple times and it keeps getting better. What really makes this movie is the acting and the way the characters are written. Judge Dredd is a no nonsense fascist lawman who out-fights and out-thinks his opponents at every turn and Urban plays him to perfection with his Dirty Harry-esque line deliveries, hard-ass attitude, and best of all, his permanent Dredd scowl. AND he does all this while keeping the helmet ON. His relationship with the rookie cop would have been a cliche and an annoyance in another movie but here the interaction is well-written and believable. Even during a firefight he's still putting the rookie through the paces. I love how Dredd summed up the events in this movie to his boss in two words, \\"Drug bust.\\" This one-liner is neither a pun nor a smart-ass remark but it tells you all you need to know about Dredd and manages to crack me up every time. Man of few words indeed.<br /><br />Come to think of it, it's sad that it's exceedingly rare nowadays to find an action movie or any movie with smartly written characters, motivation and pacing. It's easier to suspend your disbelief when the characters are believable and would act and think according to their personality instead just doing random things to lead to the next set piece. Now, \\"Dredd\\" is not \\"The Godfather\\" or \\"Citizen Kane\\" but its simple plot lends to it becoming about the journey and not the destination. It's like this breakfast sandwich I'm about to consume. Ham, egg and cheese on toasted English muffin. Simple but, in the right hands, a delicious journey.<br /><br />After reading some reviews it's annoying to see some people complaining thatthis movie was similar to or ripping off \\"The Raid\\". Let me tell ya. \\"Dredd\\" was written and went into production a year or two before \\"The Raid\\" was a twinkle in its director's eye. \\"Raid\\" is littered with terrible acting and after 30 minutes it became really tedious to watch men fighting each other to the death over and over and over and over and over and over again. If Dredd is like anything it's like having Dirty Harry in \\"DIE HARD\\". Now THAT sounds like a good movie.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this movie is that the design of the sets and Mega-City One along with the bad guys could be a little more \\"futuristic\\". I know it's due to the low budget and that the filmmakers wanted a real-world feel but it would look and feel more like we're watching some future post-apocalyptic society where crime and violence is the norm and a fascistic judicial system is needed to combat that instead of a fascist cop in hazy South Africa shooting and killing poor people (even if they are criminals) with no mercy. I also miss some of that strange and quirky tone that Mega-City One has in the comics. But that's nitpicking. It's a great movie so please, people, BUY this movie so we can get a proper sequel.<br /><br />One last thing, my wife LOVED this movie. She's not a fan of action movies or Judge Dredd and I basically had to force her to go watch this in the theater. Half way through the movie I looked over expecting her to be bored out of her mind or asleep but her eyes were riveted to the screen and she was pumped to see Dredd and Anderson kick more ass. In fact, I now have to wear a Judge Dredd helmet when we make sexy time.<br /><br />Btw, check out [[ASIN:B007X0YJ48 'Drokk' Music Inspired By Mega-City One]]. Great album. 80's John Carpenter-esque synth soundtrack originally written for this movie.
0783231032|5.0|This movie makes me wish I was back in 1941. I wish John Belushi would have lived longer and made more movies like this one.
B004ZQBOK0|1.0|Heard them for the first time live at a show in San Francisco, and have to say I'm not impressed.  Less than impressed, almost insulted.  The only reason I'm giving this one star is because Amazon won't let me post a review with zero (or negative stars), or if it does I can't figure out how.  Terrible music, terrible singing, and they don't care even the slightest bit about their fans.  Example: after posing out and not getting the reaction they were looking for (ie. they got no reaction from the crowd at all, because by that time the crowd was bored and unimpressed and doing other things at the club that had nothing to do with the band on stage) that the singer (I assume he was the singer, they all looked like the inbred spawn of Motley Crue and Kiss) had a bit of a hissy fit, declared themselves to be \\"the greatest thing since 98\\" and \\"the only gods of metal\\" and made it a deliberate point to throw his water bottle at a fan in a wheelchair at the front of the stage.  They were so awful and abusive the headlining band at the show apologized for them.  The music is derivative, their look is at the very best a copy of a fascimile of a poorly done crayon drawing of any metal band in the early 80s, and their ego and personalities are disgusting.  One of the worst bands I've heard or seen in over 30 years of music.  Avoid anything they produce like a virulent plague.  No stars ever.  (Do not comment on this review.  It is based on first-hand knowledge, as I was there.  Nothing you have to say in defense of these cretins will validate any part of their existence as a music \\"act,\\" and I will not be reading this review after it is posted.)
0446585041|5.0|Received promptly and in excellent condition.  Was a gift for my daughter for Christmas and she is reading it right now...  Planning to buy additional Ellen books!

0887431453|2.0|I bought this for my grandson and was disappointed with how little work really exists. Some of the exercises are good but many are page fillers
B007PKSN6Q|2.0|thought it would have sound tracks from original artists not some no name band<br />will not purchase again<br />arrived when promised
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|This movie is one of the best comic books come to life of all times. it is a must have...but do you need all 4 discs? I have only used the Blu Ray disc and downloaded the digital copy but still has not used it. I do not know anyone with a 3D tv and 3D blu ray player so I guess that will just sit there. I have given away the dvd. So in the end this package has it all but the deal could have been better if you just get what you need, in my case all I needed was the blu ray disc.
B004DM0UII|3.0|Not as intuitive as I think an app should be.  Consumer should not have to play with buttons for an extended time to only think they may have what the app can do.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is the best alarm clock there is. On this you can see how much sleep you are going to get.I would highly recommend.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|This one I found forgettable, kind of like Batman and Robin with George Clooney as Batman and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze. Selina Kyle (AKA Cat Woman) was no where near as convincing as Michele Pfeiffer was in Batman Returns. The problem with this movie is what it has to stand up to and it just missed those lofty goals. Casting missed the bad guy and girl target on this one...
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|Great film.  In the future of the future.  The acting was great and the story line was better.  You won't be disappointed.
B00112HZEA|5.0|We have been collecting Schleich animals for some time.  They are a perfect size.  We think they are the best,
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|For those of us that are intrigued with the concept of time travel, we rarely contemplate what we would do with that ability. Loopers forces us to reconsider the implications of such possibility. Although the movie lacks all the glitz of previous science fiction classics like \\"Total Recall\\" or the zanny humor of \\"Back into the Future\\", it does have a deeper plot that few would have guessed until the very end. The dark setting of the criminal under world and the senseless killing makes one believe it is just another blood bath with a time travel twist. I found it to be a much more human story. It begs the question of how we confront ourselves in a world full of temptations. Some take the easy way out. Yet somehow a small boy teaches us in the end, what is most important in life! Very good movie. I only give it four stars because it was only intriguing and compelling, but not completely entertaining. Still I would recommend this movie.
B001VLC3T8|5.0|We have been collecting Schleich animals for some time.  They are a perfect size.  We think they are the best,
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book The Hunger Games. Was a sit on the edge of your seat book. Keeps you spell bought from the first page to the last page. This book could be enjoyed by all ages. Can't wait to start on book number two.

B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Finally a remake/reboot of a series that is incredible. This is the way it is supposed to be done. I normally only watch a movie once but this one I have watched several times.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Best show I have seen in a while.  Great actors and the castle is beautiful.  Hope this show has many more seasons.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|Great movie, definitely a keeper. I was disappointed though that the bluray pretty much completely lacks in extra content. No commentary, behind the scenes or anything. I think it might of had some trailers, but who cares about those?
B005HSL626|1.0|it might be a good game, but i couldn't get it to run.  as soon as you slash the first fruit, it would shut down.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|I so enjoyed the book I really looked forward to the movie.  The actresses they had picked did not match the descriptions in the book.  Their are plenty actresses out there who are tall and plain, they should have been more thoughtful so the story made sense.
B004DM0UII|5.0|UI is very refined and easily usable.  There are so many channels that it's going to take a long time to listen to them all.  Plenty of choices for everyone.<br />The audio queues for connection and disconnection are nice when you don't have the screen on and wonder why your music stopped playing.  Doesn't seem related to the application at all because some of the channels were flawless and others disconnected quite a bit.  (Mostly those from across the world like Ukraine).<br />Good app, thanks for picking a good one this time Amazon.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I laughed at the part with Amazon, and funding the underworld! And I`m reading on a Kindle! Rick Riordan makes me laugh again!

B00917IQFY|4.0|This album comes out at virtually the same time as `This Is 40,' a film in which Parker plays a version of himself creating a record for a record company owner who is driven to restore his former heroes to prior glory.<br /><br />But, what about this album? It's safe to say this album has more in common with his later works such as My Country, though this is not in any way a critical failing.<br /><br />It is truly wonderful to hear the magic that unfolds on this album. Parker's work with The Figgs was good, but the listener did not and could forget while close, the shot was always a little wide of the goal. At the same time, it is important - no critical - to place this record in its proper context. Some 40 years have passed since Parker et al blew the doors off the music business with their reinvention of R&B. During that time, Parker, in his role as songwriter, has changed from the sullen, belligerent anti-establishment/anti-Thatcherite misanthrope, seeking equal measures of love and redemption to a more mature, though still committed free-thinker. The voice and tone have also changed. One hears these changes in his love songs - now built around having someone with whom he could express his vulnerability with total trust - and in his political songs - now built around anger and fury over the mis- and mal-use of power.<br /><br />The former category includes the pieces `She Rocks Me' and `That Moon Was Low.' Both songs are paeans to that special person that you know; you absolutely know was worth the wait and the battle.<br /><br />The latter category is found in three songs, one of which is the most powerful of the collection. We are reminded again of the dishonesty and disengenuous nature of politics in `Snake Oil Capital of the World:' and this message is thrown harder in `A Lie Gets Halfway `Round the World.' But, listen at your risk to `Arlington's Busy,' especially if you're feeling low because your fries were cold or the commute is taking longer or your favorite team lost. Listen and learn what is really important.n what is really important.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is a very interesting story and easy to read, but I would have enjoyed it more if some of the characters didn't remind me of real media characters (not a fan of Nancy Grace in real life or the version in the book) and if certain aspects weren't quite so contrived.  I thought the concept was brilliant though and that made it worth my time.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|great movie, arrived quickly. makes a great gift, or just good movie for a family night  together watching a movie
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I had to read this for my book club a month ago and I had a very hard time 'getting into it'.  There was a lot of violence, which isn't usually an issue for me, but I wasn't connecting with the character at all.  I stuck with it though because I have trouble NOT finishing a book and I am glad I read it through to the end.  The second half had me hooked.  The second half wasn't any less violent, but I cared about what was going to happen to the characters.  Although I was pretty sure it wasn't going to end well, I still had to know.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was iffy about this book until the very end. But once all the pieces came together, I realized just how clever the plot of this book was. Bravo, Suzanne!
B002UEW31I|4.0|I really like this movie. The best part is the service. Now I can stream Amazon Prime instant video to my xbox. I can manage my watchlist on my pc.
6305754969|1.0|I ordered three movies so I didnt watch this movie for a couple of weeks. When I started to play it, it was a cartoon &#34;Road to El Dorado&#34;. Now that I don't have the reciept to return it I guess I'm stuck with it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|MUST REAN NOW! i loved this book. it is a touching, romanic, and just amazing story like no other. couldnt put it down
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|this is my favorite game app but I can't play it now because I keep getting marmalade error message. this may have something to do with this being a VERY old version of app. I'd hate to be one of the people that paid for this.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This is a very funny movie. Lots of laughs.<br />It is for adults so be aware.<br />I recommend it for people with a good sense of humor
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Great uncompressed video and digital audio quality, amazing looking son my new HDTV. Tons if special features, not done watching all of them. Great blu ray buy, very happy on this highly underrated film.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Excellent game, very enjoyable and immersing can't wait for the sequel. Great storyline excellent artwork. Challenging puzzles. I would recommend this to all hidden object fans
B000PC6A3E|4.0|It does what was advertised, good uncompressed video and audio quality, short in the special features, but that's what's expected in a regular edition copy. Great blu ray buy nonetheless.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Damn!! I absolutely loved this book. I would recommend anyone read this. Mrs. Hoover did it again. More please! Loved it!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|It does what the disc advertised, good uncompressed video and audio quality, short in the special features, but that's what's expected in a regular edition copy. Great blu ray buy nonetheless.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I really .reading this book. My late father and father-in-law were both combat B-17 pilots in WWII as part of the 8th USAAF, and I have a little knowledge on this subject. I found the book to be very well researched and accurate. It is obvious the author painstakingly wrote this book with those goals in mind. It is a tribute to warriors on both sides of this epic war of the 20th century.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such an amazing story. I found myself crying, laughing, and smiling throught the whole book. As I read about the characters and fell in love with their story, I was shocked and surpised further when I read about the memory behind that action or scene. I really loved this book and wish I could give it more than 5 stars because this story deserves more than 5 stars. I recommend this book highly to everyone.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|This movie was truly cringe worthy. My wife and I lasted about 45 minutes and then decided to cut our losses.<br /><br />Unless you absolutely worship 80's hair band music, you will find this to be a painful viewing experience.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This is one of the great classics you just can't put down. Download it today for a great experience! Great book!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Incredible book.  It was beautifully written and easy to read.  Completely heart wrenching but amazing.  I couldn't put it down.
B002VX0A40|5.0|I was so excited to receive this in the mail! It arrived faster than I'd expected, and was packaged in an extra plastic bag. It's better than I'd imagined! Even though my little one hasn't yet arrived, I know she'll love it! It is a little bit bigger than I'd thought, but it's actually a perfect size! I can't wait to see my little one's face when she plays with it. It's truly adorable!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I knew this would be good, after all, look at the authors. If you have enjoyed either you will surely love both!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Once again instead of checking the actual reviews, I went with the total, over 5,000, which indicated a four star book.<br />Wrong.  Over half the people that read the book gave it a 3 star or less.  I kept waiting for the main characters to be<br />real people.  This isn't just dark, it's stupid. what a waste of money.  I hope I've learned my lesson with the amazon<br />rating system.
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|Not a great story, confusing if you have not seen the previous versions or sequals. Too much action, not enough story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best book of the series.(so far):)<br />If  you have not read it , read it know.<br />You will love it!
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Very much followed a formula. I was looking forward to this movie and was disappointed. Clint Eastwood's character is much like the one he plated in Gran Torino, but that movie was much better.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Brand new in shrink wrap. My sister wanted it for Christmas. It arrived on or before expected. Great Product; Great Price; Great Service.
B00A23MVHA|4.0|Ted was much better than I expected. It caught me off guard with the adult humor... But in a good way
0060566108|4.0|I needed it for a college course. It definitely provokes a lot of thought. Very interesting . I wouldn't have bought it for leisure reading.
0307730697|5.0|I am not a person who really likes to read, I am the type of person that says I'll wait for the movie to come out. Not with this book, I recieved it for Christmas and haven't put it down. This is a riveting story of a man named Adam Brown and his rise up from the ashes of basically being at rock bottom in his life to become one of the best of the best in the United States Navy. A man who overcame any and all odds put in front of him to become a member of the Elite SEAL Team Six. After reading this book and being a veteran of the Navy I now wish I had the honor and privilege to meet Adam before I got out. This is story of a TRUE American Hero and Patriot. Read Fearless and you will not be disapointed.
1591396190|4.0|I needed it for a college course. It definitely provokes a lot of thought. Very interesting . I wouldn't have bought it for leisure reading.
038551123X|3.0|I did not like the story at all. The TV Series was much better developed. Not believable. The book as an item was ok of course.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is by far the best game ever.  The concept is certainly captivating... flowing thick liquid, looks like oil. Subsequent levels are more divergent and difficult.  The music is fine too.  Can't stop playing this.  Thanks to Amazon for the free app of the day.  Would certainly be willing to pay for something as innovative as this!
1401322786|5.0|Everybody on the planet needs to read this book!  It makes you think about life and what you do with it.  Please READ THIS!!
B000W9DSVW|3.0|After i purchased this, they released the same three pack, repackaged in a slimer case for 9 bucks. Shouldve waited
B005VPRGB0|5.0|This item was ordered closer to Christmas than I had planned, but I got it quickly and at a more than reasonable price.  Thanks so much!
1401238580|1.0|I thought this mask would be like the sturdy hard plastic ones ive seen elsewhere. It is just a cheap halloween mask type material.. Much like the clear plastic that comes as the backing for toys and action figures. Worst of all it has a hanging tab right on the top center of the forehead.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing! I used to reading mainly romance books without any other substance to them. I was pleasantly suprisedthat this book had both romance ad a whole other story line all in one. This book was simply beautiful. I cried, i ooo'd and awww'd. I had so many emotions throughtout this entire book. I don't think i've ever been this emotionally connected to a book before. I loved it and would tell everyone they need to read this book asap!
B000LPS4BG|4.0|We were very happy with this purchase. It came in the mail fast, and we would shop here again. Thanks!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I really love the Kindle version.I have no complaint regarding content or presentation. I have not seen pages missing or formatting errors

B004SEUIXS|5.0|This is a wonderful French movie that I bought for a friend.  I was happy to find it in English, a great product, and was received when expected.
030758836X|2.0|So I spent a day reading this book - I couldn't put it down - and at the end, felt as if I'd wasted a day.<br /><br />The author pulls you in with a funny, nuanced and believable story of a marriage. It works on two levels -- it's a mystery, but it's also an allegory about the power struggle that virtually every marriage inevitably involves, even in good marriages that work.<br /><br />But the ending is completely preposterous. And even if you read that as a marital allegory, then it's a pretty bleak and un-nuanced interpretation.
1439153663|2.0|The story was ok, but just kept going on and on and on. Way too many dead babies for me! Horribly depressing!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Long, pointless and after ten minutes not very funny. Previews highlighted best lines and they turned out to be squeezed into an almost two hour movie. Surprised since this movie did so well at the box office. I get Seth McFarland's humor, it's just not for me.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This CD contains more of the songs that she really does best.  She is great, but there are certain types of songs that she really does better than others and these are the ones.  Her voice is better and stronger also.
B009M1QRM8|5.0|I'm a hardcore fan of Preston and Child, they keep a straight record of never disappointing me, both in their combined and solo books. In Two Graves they did it again. Excellent plot, important old mysteries form previous books are revealed and obviously, a few incredible new ones are created to be solved in the future. Amazing how the authors manage to combine situations from older Pendergast stories, that didn’t have any obvious connection, and introduce them back as interconnected pieces that support the new plot in a very clever way. Long life for the three of you!<br /><br />Andre Jalonetsky
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I purchased this do add to my synology DS1812+ and it works perfectly. Total overall available memory went to 3072mb, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone for use in a compatiable Synology NAS or laptop.
0812993357|2.0|I had really looked forward to this book because I was fascinated with the down to earth attitude she had for fashion, and in the beginning I admired her dedication to her career, but then it was &#34;And then I married...,and than I worked with.. and then I slept with. I didn't feel she really gave a feeling that you were seeing all  the wonderfully talented people she in an intimite way.<br />Half way through the book I put it aside.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great story line.  Tied in several themes.  Story flowed without long drawn out scenes.  Good antagonist.  Flynn has set up a string of follow up books
B002APU580|5.0|Great film when you want to snuggle up with your partner with a bowl of popcorn, or a little wine and cheese. Funny, well written, well acted and thoroughly entertaining.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Loved it! It is one of the best syfy movies of all time. Hope the make a sequel or prequel focusing On the natives and their dogma!
B005VPRETE|4.0|5.5 years old is just a little young. We are saving it. She was flummoxed by it. The instructions are just pictures and the pieces are not the size of regular Lego. Please keep that in mind. Many, many tiny parts... I'm stressed out by the tininess of it! ha ha. But she will grow in to it. Not what we were hoping for but not the fault of the toy!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book definitely worth the price.I have no complaints except I wish I didn't have to wait so long for a sequel.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I loved this book!  I have actually read it twice and it was still interesting the 2nd time around. Stephen King is amazing.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|These two authors and their characters keep you coming back book after book. Pendergast threw me for a loop this time. Well worth the read and every penny.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a true life adventure story written in a page turning style I've yet to see in any other book of history. Unfortunately, I've yet to find a comparable book covering the Reconstruction Era.
B0094K1K42|2.0|This movie was by far one of the most uncomfortable watches I have ever had to endure.  To label it as a comedy (even a dark one) is a sick joke.  Charlize does a phenomenal job at portraying a train wreck of a writer who has not mentally or emotionally progressed from her prom queen days in her po-dunk town.  Unfortunately this train wreck is one I consistently found myself redirecting my view or making excuses to exit the room because of the sheer level of discomfort her encounters evoked.  To keep this brief and to the point: just watch a different movie.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I will read this book again and again.  Denny 's courage and Enzo's loyalty is inspirational.  Strongly recommend to anyone who has ever loved an animal.
0307341569|5.0|Awesome story!  Awesome writter!  Good book, in excellent condition.  Wish this author had more books out, I have read everything she has written
B001AGXEAG|4.0|I thought the movie was very entertaining.  Who ever sees this movie will want to keep watching.  Comedy, music, ghosts.
0307341542|5.0|Love this author!  have read every one of her book and would recommend them!  Wish she would write more so I would have something to read!
1417733993|5.0|bought it for my 8 year old who loves to draw - not sure he's looked at it, but he likes the animal version of this book
030758836X|5.0|highly recommend this book and any book by this author!  couldn't put it down!  looking for more books by her.  excellent price for a hardback book!
1417734035|5.0|great book for 8 year olds - easy to follow. not sure son has looked at uit yet, but he loves the animal version.  Or, if this the book that has the purate ship in it - he LOVES IT!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|awesome show!  since you can't watch back shows on demand or online the dvd series is well worth the money!
1417734027|5.0|bought this for my 8 year old son who loves to draw.  he spent a sick day at home doing all these pics - he found the pictrues easy to follow and really liked being able to draw something identifiable and not get frustrated with it. I had this book as a kid and i loved it too!
B000VZUWZW|4.0|First, I want to qualify that I am some what of a geek. I share many of the same passions as the protagonists and my friends exhibit many similar idiosyncrasies. But trying to watch the initial first season left me with a bitter taste. Let me list a few:<br /><br />1. The forced laughter (had me convinced it was a laugh track before I looked it up, seriously folks, not every other line deserves an LOL).<br />2. The repetitive structure of the humor: define every other noun by reading off of Wikipedia (that's what it sounds like to me), explain every concept in scientific/exact terms. While these aren't necessarily bad, when mixed with the forced laughter, it just makes me cringe).<br />3. Sheldon: I hate that guy.<br />4. Everyone else: why do they take his abuse?<br />5. The number of genuine humor in this show that doesn't rely heavily on cheap comic reference or scientific jargon is few and far between.<br />6. This entire show portrays nerds and geeks at their worst.<br />7. Missing vast swath of the geek culture while praying mainly on the comic book nerds: where's the love for anime? manga? xkcd? PhD comics??<br />8. The use of high-school/freshmen college science/math to show the \\"genius\\" of PhDs.<br /><br />My initial gut reaction to this show was that this is a cheap geek knockoff for the mainstream with dumb-downed science straight from the writers factory. But I decided to give it another shot after hearing an interview Neil Degrasse Tyson had with someone from the show. And to my delight, many of my initial reactions were mislead. There is real science (though some of it erroneous) and from season 4 on there was real character development. It made the cast way more relatable. Sheldon started acting less arrogant and just plain childish. The rest of the cast started to tease him and talk back. There are occasional mentions of anime but never once xkcd or PhD comics. Come on! There's so much gold in there waiting to be dug up.<br /><br />The rest are stilltrue, but I've learned to ignore them and enjoy the finer things about the show. Overall, I feel the show makes geeks more relatable and more human than the stereotypical cast they get in other shows/movies. That, while probably the only redeeming factor for me, is enough to mitigate the rest.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|saw it over the summer and my kids said to me when it was over - mommy we need to buy it when it comes out on DVD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days (it would've been sooner if I didn't have children)!
B002BBJ52U|3.0|An easy to digest film that tries to over simplify the complications of dating.  However, it's not offensive or stupid, a nice watch for a Sunday afternoon.
B004132I4S|5.0|This album is smooth haha I use that term because one song just melts straight into the next, without you even realising. The track is about 20 minutes long, what a journey that is in itself!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The writing style was different, not to mention hard to follow in the beginning. However, I read this in one day. I could not put it down!
B0091574VI|5.0|HD footage is amazing.  Adult and kid friendly.  What beautiful cinematography.  I would definitely recommend the HD version.  Great buy.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've tried other office suites (Kingsoft, Polaris and a few others) but this one is hands down my favourite. It works quite well on both my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and my Galaxy SIII, and connecting it to Dropbox was a snap. I save as a docx and my MS Word on my computer opens it with no problem. Well worth the price.
0788859544|4.0|This product came on time and we couldnt be happier with it.It was my favorite movie as a child and now I get to share it with my little girl.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fun fun fun, if you like a good story and lushly shot period pieces. Worth the hype; I can't wait to get caught up.
B00846TTDG|5.0|Well acted. Moves along well. A good movie from an entertainment perspective as well as having some historical basis. Enjoyed
B003JIPJRE|5.0|Awsome movie! Draws you in from the get go. All around this movie was great!  This movie was better than most full length feature films. Yea it was that good.
B008Y7Y0AM|3.0|The more you listen to this CD the more it will grow on you. But I still feel it is missing that WoW! factor that I have come to expect from MDB. The CD almost feels like For Lies I Sire Part II. IMO I feel it is time for MDB to move on to another \\"experimental\\" type album for the next release. The slow, grinding, moaning element has been ongoing for too long now. They have always been a excellent band when they diversify their music a bit more (Example: Like Gods of the Sun). The last couple of albums have really been one dimensional and it is starting to bore me...
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Even my husband enjoyed sitting and watching this one with me.The movie was well done,and we enjoyed it very much
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Life of Pi. Great read.  Inspiring and beautifully written.  It opens your eyes to what imagination and determination can bring.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I am having fun trying to reach different levels on this game I find it relaxing and does not add stress to your life.
B005HSL626|5.0|My daughter plays it for hours, we have and Xbox 360 and she owns a DSi but spends a lot of time with this game on her Kindle Fire...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead keeps getting better and better with every season! Every episodes leaves you wanting to watch the next one. Fair warning, don't start watching episodes on a work night.
B003F3NDOO|5.0|Cougar Town is hilarious! We can't wait to watch the new season when it starts this week! Get a bottle of wine and rent or buy this series!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|My gandbabies seem to like it.  The youngest one plays it the most. Wish I could get three more kindled then I could have mine back.
B001KWZ796|5.0|Ever After is my favorite movie! I guess you are never too old to outgrow happy endings or the romance of true love. I grew up watching the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical version of Cinderella with the magical pumpkins and fairy Godmother. When a story came out that could make the &#34;fable&#34; to have possibly been written about a real relationship and the story line is plausible, it makes &#34;happily ever after&#34; seem possible, and dare I say...probable? If you are a romantic, you can't go wrong with this movie!
B006964E8S|4.0|I liked this as a good to read as a good suspense work. It remained readable right to the end with a not forseen ending.
B00AAX68HG|3.0|Addictive game with a humorous theme. May get monotonous over time, but overall it is a pretty fun game. Above average.
B008476HBM|5.0|Wonderful story and loved all the &#34;proper&#34; behavior along with the secret thoughts of a young girl back in the 19th Century.  When marriage was the main course for unmarried ladies and how involved the entire family became in order to strive for that objective.  I have wanted to read this work for a long time after becoming interested in 19th Century classics, I wasn't disappointed.  Lizzie being so bright and level headed was refreshing in comparison to her younger sisters and even with her older sister Jane, the kindest one.  The one character, Mr. Darcy was hard to understand his aloofness to the point of being extremely rude just didn't seem to fit at first meeting since later in the book he showed himself to be so totally compassionate and sensitive to Lizzie's trouble's with her younger sister's plight.  All's well that end's well, loved the book.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|cant pass bucket filling level,  but its still fun. although I think 2$ is a little spendy for this game.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|Batman was supposed to be a hero and this movie makes him out to be the bad guy.  It was too dark and I did not like it.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|I purchased all four seasons for my husband for Christmas, he just finished Season One and is starting<br />Season Two. He LOVES this show!
B001IYVUEW|4.0|I liked Batman Begins because it gives an in-depth description of how batman became batman.  I would reccomend it to anyone who likes comics.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|I purchased all four episodes of Sons of Anarchy for my husband for Christmas. As soon as the Christmas rush was over he started a marathon of the episodes. He LOVES this show.
B00APUQMD4|5.0|I loved this movie because I love to see Alice take names and kick butt.  I would reccommend this movie to everyone.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|He just finished a  marathon of the first season and now is heading into Season 2. I purchased all four seasons since the series is done for a few months. Should get him happy for a time.
B009G5TWFO|4.0|This was a good movie.  I think though that the sex scene could have been eliminated.  If it had a lower rating, I could have let my grandchildren watch it.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|She loves it  Speak Now World Tour Live [CD/DVD] (Audio CD)<br />This concert was the best concert I she has seen in a long time. She would recommend this to any fan of<br />Taylor Swift. She just goes beyond the call with this concert. Best Ever.
B001I189MQ|3.0|This was a good movie but it was slow going in some places and too dark for my taste.  I will not watch it again.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I like every song on this album and absolutely LOVE 4 of them (Radioactive, It's Time, Demons, and Every Night)
B008K9SG9K|5.0|The music is beautiful and entertaining. I gave the CD to my fiance for Christmas and after listening to it about 8 times in 3 days he is still not tired of it!
0596805888|5.0|If you like chemistry and you like cooking, this is the book that marries them well. Gave it to my daughter the engineer.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|I haven't been this super excited about a band for a while. Reminds me of The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and other greats from the 60s and 70s. Instant classic, not one bad track! Tied with Beach House \\"Bloom\\" for album of the year in my book. If you love good music, you need this album! I hope they are around for a looooong time. Thank you Australia for your imports of import...
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I hope this program lasts for many seasons. Wonderful writing, solid acting, high quality production, but I only just heard about it last week! The network needs to market it more boldly so it doesn't get cancelled..
B0081KTI0E|5.0|Daniel does a super job .. this character is nothing like Harry.. Scary , spooky, suspenseful, heart stopping ,just a great movies to get the blood flowing... I loved it!
B0063GORYU|4.0|GOOD GAME  but I like to place my card where I like to. The game puts the card to a space it wants and that makes a move I don't want.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|i love channing and the movie was great, so I watch it over and over and he's the best ever
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought this book was absolutely fantastic. There were tons of twists ans turns that totally keep you guessing and intrigued the whole time.  Such an amazing thrill to read!
B000BYRCH4|5.0|I've seen the movie before and i love paul walker and jessica alba, both of them are such great actors
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Omg I loved it I can't wait for book three! I hope they make these books into movies :) I hope so!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It's scary to think that there really are relationships in our everyday world like this one. I found this to be a very good read. I don't normally read this type of book, but liked all the reviews, so I though I would try it. I was not thrilled with the end, but I can see why she took it in the direction that she did. I really don't think I could handle reading another of her books so soon after reading this one. It was a little too twisted for me.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this in two sittings. It kept me interested even though it was weirdly written. Good story line though.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|The characters were just not very sympathetic or interesting. There was some action, some comedy, some drama... but mostly it was just dark. Did not really care for it but others might like the twists.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|have had a fun time playing. got hubs addicted to it as well. i only wish that i could redraw bob.
B000001DYJ|5.0|Great Cd. I had one before but something happen to it and needed a new one. Great place to get one. love it!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This movie was restored with TLC and viewing it is just an awesome experience! As other reviewers have mentioned, one can see every blade of grass; the details of the costumes; and scenery like never before. Also the extras such as photos of Saltzburg, Austria and the movie story book make this an even more attractive package. Viewing this movie is an uplifting experience and is highly recommended for the entire family.<br /><br />Note that I did have difficulty getting my older BD Player (Samsung BD-1590) to play the BD DVD movie. It would stop when trying to create the menu. I suspect that the problem was with loading the BD Live content portion of the menu, as there is an interactive mode that requires loading BD Live content. I found a workaround by removing the flash drive on which the BD Live content is stored before the movie is inserted; then re-inserting the flash drive after the move menu was displayed. Doing this I was able to access the interactive menu OK. I'm sure that the DVD is perfect and the source of this problem is with my BD player; however I mention it in case another purchaser may have an older BD DVD player that experiences this or a similar problem. I had previously ensured that I did have the latest firmware update loaded for my BD player (last updated in July 2012), however this update did not fix the problem.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I LOVED THE BOOK! FOUR STARS!  I'D RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYBODY WHO LOVES DRAMATIC STORIES! HOPE YOU'LL ENJOY THE BOOK AS MUCH AS I DID!
B007T99ENE|4.0|Once again , McEwan has written a complex novel with well drawn,credible but flawed, intriguing characters and unexpected plot twists. Sweet Tooth , like all confections, leaves the reader wanting more.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|love this case , covers all ports makes phone less bulky then the otterbox. Glad i purchased this instead of other product.
1439107955|5.0|Can't go wrong.  Most interesting, authoritative book that explains the history of cancer and it's treatment.  Fascinating stories to explain the complex issues.
B003B02OQ4|5.0|Grisham never disappoints and this book is no exception.  You will have a love/hate relationship with &#34;the client&#34; and enjoy the twists and turns until the very end.  A real page turner.
B0038P59A0|1.0|another horrible Hollywood movie written for a 12 year old. even Hollywood can ruin a great story. Try to stay awake
B000FA5SMK|5.0|DeMille really takes the reader on a whirlwind adventure in this novel.  I was having heart palpitations!!!  There seems to be no end to his story telling abilities.  Can't really give much of a review without giving away some of the plot.....suffice to say &#34;this is book you cannot put down&#34;.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I like the main characters, and this book has many unsuspected twists and turns, but the ending didn't leave me with that &#34;Vince Flynn&#34; feeling I have grown to expect.
B003B02O0A|5.0|A true Grisham novel in every sense of the word.  He weaves a story like no other, leaving the reader feeling like they are right there.  This one gives you some points to ponder and may change how you feel about the issue at hand.  Super!!!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I have never been a big history  or biography reader but after seeing &#34;Lincoln&#34; decided to try this book. I loved the movie but the book is soooo much more! I really admire the even-handed way that Goodwinshows us the full ranges of all the characters personalities but does it without sounding judgmental.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Why would you not buy this?  It's Alien!  I bought this anthology when it was $20 and for that price it was a steal.
0525952926|3.0|Although this second novel in Follet's covers many years, many characters and many locations, he often fails to make you feel deeply about his characters.  His writing is concise and gives you a decent overall look at the times, it just doesn't create a connection.  Three stars out of five.
B000002KLZ|5.0|This is a great double live Fleetwood Mac CD set.  I also liked that the product was shipped securely so it was protected and it was still in the original packaging.  Im very happy with this product.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app is awesome but if you don't like waiting (like, for 9-13 hours) you will hate it. I love breeding dragons it is always a surprise you need to pay attention to the habitats.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|I'll admit that this movie was no cinematic masterpiece, but I still really enjoyed the modern day fairytale element. Kyle growing as a person, combined with the blossoming romance with Lindy, was entertaining and not overdone. The story might be a little predictable and cheesy, but the great cast and soundtrack make up for all of that. I've watched this movie a few times now and enjoyed it each time.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|good if you like scary games. I finished in like, 5 mins. it was boring. not my type of game. :( should be cheeper too.
B009FXIICK|4.0|Like the game.  Same premise as Tetris Attack (to an extent) which I LOVED growing up, but haven't found a similar iteration at this time to play.<br /><br />PROS: Beautiful layout (especially on tablets!), good game play, free-to-play (with restrictions), responsive and challenging.<br /><br />CONS: Limits you to 2 games at a time (which takes you 2-5 minutes each to complete) unless you *buy* recharging bits.  Sustainable biz for the producers who have made an addictive game.  However, the online matching is ALL-OVER-THE-PLACE.  The game plays on a rating/ranking system and you're apparently supposed to get matched up with a somewhat equal opponent... Lots of times, you'd get SMASHED by a lower ranked opponent and you'd be scratching your head when you thought that you had this game in the bag.  That frustrated me enough to uninstall it as I would probably end up getting too pissed. Haha!  That and the recharging time were too much for me.
B00914JWSW|5.0|When I saw this cd advertised, I knew this would be the perfect gift for my aunt.  I was right!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Played it on my Android cell phone and enjoyed it.  It is easier to play on a larger screen.  I wouldn't pay tp have it but since it's free, I use it.
B006OHZVOS|5.0|When I was little my aunt gave me this book and it is my favorite 30 years later.  I wanted to share it with my daughter!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Outside of the main character, you never really knew the others, then were expected to know them well at the end. So-so ending, seemed like he was in a hurry to finish.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Great read, a lot of legal mumbo jumbo in the middle and the usual jumping around. Great ending  to the series.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was really good. The only draw back is that it's pretty predictable. If your looking for good romance, then this book is for you.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Excellent for all married or those getting married in the future. It shows people about things they may not even realize. A good eye opener & would recommend to alll.
B0025KW29U|5.0|My son and daughter (14 and 17) sing these songs together for fun, since they memorized words. When their big sister comes to visit, it is a trio.<br /><br />This is a fun engaging and touching show, with well acted, believable characters, (as believable as characters in a musical can be...) .<br /><br />Even my wife, who initially asked \\"Why did you order THAT?\\" will put this in and watch it on a regular basis.<br /><br />I guess it's hard to beat serious silliness.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|works great on my kindle fire. really enjoy that it looks great on my hd screen. . . . .
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow. It started off really slow but like every one of his books, Sparks pulled it off. With a terribly heart breaking and loving twist at the end, this book will take you in a direction you didn't see coming. Another great novel by this truly talented author.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|One of our favorite versions of the Christmas Carol.  Lost our previous copy. It's good to have it back.  Thanks
B009JBZH54|5.0|This Blu Ray set is amazing the digital copy works great the special features are packed full my only complaint is that the DVD version of this package the casing looks better but other than that small thing no complaints
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|My Alarm Clock Free . I did not like it at all so it was uninstalled. I rate it two stars.
B00407PNWO|5.0|It's very hard to find a good gift for my Dad, and finding this was awesome!!!! He watched the movie as soon as he opened his gift!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Good book overall but kind of  repetitive .<br /><br />.Feels like the same sex scene over and over. Not as interesting as the first book.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|This was part 2 of a Christmas gift. It works because the person is not up to date with the ways people can listen to music. But, they can put a CD in the CD player!!! :-)
B005LAJ16I|1.0|it's a SOAP hooking you to keep watching even though it's all about 'relationships - ugh' with a very thin plot.  and its anti-military, anti-CIA propaganda is not even subtle.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Still learning how to use all the features-but so far we are happy with the camera. It is not user friendly to point and snap a picture but is workable
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Wonderful music so glad I took the time to get this. A mixture of smooth songs with a good voice and upbeat at the same time. So creative.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|people are saying u have to buy the Jeri levels? well get 3 stars on all levels and it unlocks!!! if u cant get 3 stars on all levels then ur not a true angry bird fan!! just saying..
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really had some hesitations about reading this book --a bunch of kids thrown into some type of arena forced to fight to the death? No thank you.  But it has been so popular, and when I received my new Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas, I thought I'd give it a try by downloading the Sample to my Kindle.  I'm really glad that I did and ended up buying the book because I found that I really enjoyed reading it. It is not nearly as barbaric as I thought it might be and I would definitely recommend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the setting and costumes and era. I admire this particular time and place in history and the characters are outstanding.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This app is really fun and addicting. It has great graphics and isn't impossible to understand. Great for all ages!!!
B009VL28W2|5.0|Livraison rapide et le coût excellent. Je vais surement faire à nouveau des achats sur Amazone dès que j'aurai un besoin.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Couldn't put it down. So many twists & turns. A psychological thriller. My Bookclub is doing it next. Will definitely read more books by Gillian Flynn
B00845PT18|1.0|this movie is a joke. poorly written and even worse acting. 1hr 36min of my life I wish I had back
B008QLXSG8|3.0|It has been over 50 years since I read The Stranger, and having read much about Camus recently, I decided to re-read some of his works that are now seen as classics.  The descriptions of the life of the French colony in pre-WW11 Algeria are interesting pictures of a way of life that is no more.  The plot, if it can be called that, is the tale of a man's anomie or estrangement from society leading to his death.  It raises philosophic questions, but I don't know that those questions are seen as being as pressing today as they were in the post-war period.  As a warning about the effects of indifference or detachment is is an almost a polemic.  Had the \\"hero\\" shown more concern for his fate and been a bit more engaged, the text would have shown less inevitability and more complexity.<br /><br />If you are looking a book to provoke thought rather than entertain, this is well worth reading.
B004EI2NM2|5.0|The story takes place almost exclusively with the ladies in....guess what.... a room in Rome. I have watched the movie a number of times since I bought it and do not get tired of the story nor the fact that their bodies are almost always naked and beautiful. What a lovely way to spend a week end, in Rome or anywhere else.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love the game. Like to have it on my Kindle so I can take it with me. Great time passer
B0033PSH4U|5.0|One of my favorite all-time movies. Love the doowop background music, New York early '60s scene, and the thoughtful story line of a son growing up in the 'hood, being tugged alternately by the &#34;romantic&#34; idea in the youngster's mind of the &#34;cool&#34; local mafia boss as opposed to the steadying influence of a loving, ordinary working man father. Robert DeNiro is superb as the father and Chaz Palmentieri portrays the mafia boss beautifully.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game on the go for my Kindle Fire. Like everything about it. You can work alone or on the internet with another.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|I'm quite the fan of Twitch, and this app brings me all that I love about twitch except for some key features. As others have mentioned, I cannot sign in to my account to watch those that I am following, nor can I adjust the quality to HD. If these features were added it would easily be a 5 star, but without I can only afford three.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I have all 6 Seasons & just added this one to my collection.  I so love this show it is great!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|i love daria and the movies i am so glad that they offer the complete series on dvd and as a bonus in the complete animated series on the last disk they have the 2 movies that they made is it fall yet and the college one
B002BWP49M|5.0|The books are fantastic & so are the movies.  I thought they did a great job on this one - each movie keeps getting better.
B002N5N5QQ|4.0|my husband got me watching this show and it is addictive i have bought him every season and he watches the current one on the live video option from amazon it is a great show
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A great pageturner. I will be reading the rest of the series.<br /><br />Been looking for a series just like this.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|this is my all time favorite show!! it is so funny i love how the nerdy guys are so cool the way they interact with each other is unparralleled
1449410243|5.0|I do believe they are working on forming ultra mega kitten.<br /><br />I you love cats, love books and think laughter rocks buy this book. That is all.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|We enjoyed the traditional favorites like &#34;Winter Wonderland&#34; and others included such as &#34;Here Comes the Sun&#34;.<br />Another great collection of songs from James Taylor.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I thought the acting was great and the movie was true to the printed word. I have watched almost all of the versions currently available and this is the best by far.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is awesome and love the fact that I can also get devotions of all different types with this Bible version.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|She always keeps me reading Another great Scarpetta novel Waiting for the next one Kay, Lucy ,Benton and Marino I feel like I know them
B003UYV08E|5.0|This was a gift for my husband, he really enjoys this movie and watches then over & over again, the second movie was good!
B003XU7IFY|5.0|There is so much of this book, and it is all great reading.<br />The book is based on question and answer sessions between Chomsky and various audiences. The editing organizes the content by topic. I like the question and answer style; usually someone asked the question I have in mind, so I feel part of the conversation.<br />If I had to complain about anything: Since it wasn't created as one coherent volume, Chomsky repeats similar topics sometimes. The editing does a good job of sorting the content by topic, but occasionally you reread thoughts that you saw before.
030758836X|3.0|Didn't like the writing style.  The second half of the book was better, probably because I finally got invested in the characters
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Pros:<br />Four real cores rather than dual core with hyperthreading. It doesn't make much different for me now, but I like knowing I have it.<br />Fast. Calculates 8 million digits of pi using Super Pi in 2 minutes and a few seconds.<br />Runs cool with the stock heatsink. CoreTemp gives the hottest core at 28 C at idle and 58 C under gaming load.<br />Reasonable price. Amazon had it for less than the slower I5 3450.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Locked multiplier. I wasn't willing to pay extra for an Z77 motherboard to enable overclocking compared to H77, but this matters to some.<br />Integrated graphics. I didn't try it. This won't matter if you have a dedicated graphics card or don't game.
B00AES0AZI|5.0|&#34;Watchers&#34; is one of those unexpected books that has everything that the the genre has to offer.  If you've begun to think that  that mystery /sci fi/adventure novels have &#34;been there, done that&#34;, prepare to be surprised.  Almost as entertaining as the story, Dean Koonts' afterword says a lot about the writer and his relationship with this particular story. An excellent read.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|My son needed this for school.  So glad to find it easily on line.  My son enjoyed reading this book.
1451662432|5.0|Well wrote, He is one motivated individual, over all excellent book and better than I expected.  You can achieve anything if you set your mind to it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have been using Evernote for about a year now and it has made my life a lot easier and simplified organization and follow-ups. When I got my Kindle Fire it was naturally one of the first apps to install. I also want to correct something the first review I read about the terms of service claiming ownership to my uploaded data; that is simply not correct. Evernotes TOS do not make any such claim; in ? fact it is quite the opposite. I read the terms of service.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Love this movie! It brings a thrilling side to this children's tale. Two worlds and Coraline doesn't know which one she likes better, until she finds one is not as it seems
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This author can do no wrong.  WOW.  What a novel.  I LOVED it!!  The drama and love story was perfection.  TWO HUGE THUMBS UP!!  Can not wait to read more from this amazing author!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is such a wonderful family movie. We have a 2 year old and a 4 year old and they both loved watching it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Sad the author is gone. This trilogy made putting down the &#34;book&#34; hard to do. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is an excellent ending.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Pretty well made game. Lots of in app purchasing. No regrets with this one.  Would buy again for sure. Word
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The story itself was good, it kept me wanting to read more, but the further I read the more sexual graphic it became.  There were terms used that really shocked me!  Nevertheless, it was a good story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one. The hunger games does it again, Collins hit a home run with this series
B007KZY1YY|2.0|unless you read the first one and absolutely loved it and must find out how their story develops, dont bother. it's more of the same. you will have gotten the jist of things after the first one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Series is the best I've read in a long time...couldn't stop reading them. Would recommend this to anyone...can't wait to watch the movies!!!<br />G
B0051UH6W4|5.0|couldn't put it down. great characters, the storyline was really interesting.<br />the story changes between past and present but there is a consistent flow throughout the whole book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|;;;; This looks like its going to be another fun adventure the graphics are amazing.  I love all my Amazon games and yet this one i think will surpass the rest. Great job once again.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|You know when you look up and realize you were engrossed in a book?  I was captivated after the first 2 pages.  There was a light innocence about the book that gave the characters such life.  You could almost feel yourself there watching the levitating girl who had to slip into her weighted shoes to stay down.  I loved the pictures as the book went along.  Previous comments regarding inability to read the notations on the pictures I did not encounter.  I read on an Ipad Mini and had no problem viewing the pictures or captions.  This book was listed in the teens section.. I am an adult with three children.  I loved disappearing into this book whenever I could get away.  This would be a great movie.
B004X4QW42|5.0|The movie is more of a reality martial arts movie compared to the 'old school' flying-in-the-air etc movies.<br /><br />The humble disposition of the actor was striking when one also think about the martial arts superiority.<br /><br />I also like the &#34;'reason&#34; for his fighting. The normal story line for these types of movie is some young boy stumbles upon a martial arts master; is trained; revenges his family or some love one death. In this movie the reason for the IP Man using his skills is for (it appears) a non self-centred caused - for his family, community and by extension country.<br /><br />I showed the movie to a group of teenage boys showing social change a man may have to go through in life and some of the expectations of him.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Boring boring boring...sure the guys looked great but how long can that hold your attention? Could have used some more of a lot of things.
B007OLYPW2|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The author succeeds in making a page turning mystery out of a pair of academic pairs. It's just lovely.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I liked the story, thought the characters were well written.  Some of the story was unbelievable, but overall enjoyed reading it.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|I recommend highly if you want to know more about Margaret Thatcher of England who, in my opinion, is a model for all women everywhere.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book series is easily one if my favorites. Kudos to Collins and bravo to anyone who reads this masterpiece.
0007350740|5.0|I recommend this book HIGHLY to anyone who takes any kind of prescription drugs regularly, such as<br />Statins and antidepressants and also many others. It is written by a physician who painstakingly reveals what<br />is wrong with the pharmaceutical industry AND the associated research and research publications industries. They are<br />bedfellows, all of them, and they end up deceiving the public and physicians alike by publishing only positive research<br />results and none of the negative. This causes people to die because these drugs cannot be properly evaluated - it is deception of the worst kind that has been going on since the 1950's. I am aghast and mad.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Quits onEVERY video so you cannot watch it through the end. DO NOT get this app. WORTHLESS!  I TRIED SIX DIFFERENT VIDEOS!  I cant get rid of this fast enough!
0307949508|5.0|I love it. I havn't quite reach the end of the story, buut I can't wait to find out how Lisbeth Salander will come out.<br />If you have enjoyed &#34;The girl with the dragon tatoo&#34;, you will no doubt appreciate twice as much &#34;The girl who played with fire&#34; . . .and what fire, or more accurately what fires !
B00961ZGQC|5.0|Even though it was on the radio constantly, I just love this song! I sing it to my baby girl and she loves it, too!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Inception has been a &#34;top 2&#34; film for me since I first saw it on DVD in 2011. (The other top film is Apollo 13.) The brilliance of Christopher Nolan is extraordinary. It took me several times watching the film before it all made sense. I am no film critic, I can only say that for me this film is truly amazing matched by the music of Hans Zimmer.<br />I recently purchased a Blu Ray disc player and now have HD quality when playing Blu Ray discs. If you have a HD monitor/TV, you owe it to yourself to acquire a Blu Ray player. The content is at least as good any other source connected to the HD monitor/TV. Also, the ability to connect to Amazon (I am a Prime member) with most recent Blu Ray players is significant.<br />Watching Inception in Blu Ray as compared to DVD is breathtaking. The video and audio clarity and vividness are remarkable.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Ben Kingsley brought Gandhi back to life in this wonderful production and brought back memories of his tragic end. A stunning movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Hopeless was really good. It had a little twist but it was predictable. I read it in a couple hours. Its good not too graphic as somebody the other reviews said.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|Adventure Sci-Fi with great FX features, a fast moving story that's only flaw was that the beautiful young lady from the first two movies was absent.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a real page turner that left me wondering how well we can know anyone. I definitely recommend this book to anyone that enjoys drama and suspense.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love that all 8 movies are in one little package. The movies are fine quality and the case is nice.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|hi I'm Bob and I love to eat hamburgs and I think this is the best game ever especialy for my pet cockroach named hamburgars
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Loved the movie when it originally came out.  The 3D effects bring out a whole new movie.  I recommend this to anyone who truly enjoyed the movie the first time.
B007SWZVBQ|3.0|I love the glee show and everyone on it.  This one was a little weak.  Recommended for all Glee fans.
B009JBZH54|3.0|Exactly what it says: Blu-ray of each movie along with special features.<br /><br />The additional book is a nice addition.<br /><br />If you don't own the Blu-Ray of the movies, this is a must-have if you like the movies.  5/5<br /><br />Review of the movies:<br />I may be the only person in the world, but Batman Begins is my favorite.  I own it on DVD already, but I always wanted to own it on Blu-ray.  I understand that there's not much they can visually improve upon, but this was a let down how BB looks.  Using a up converter DVD or Blu-Ray player with the original DVD looks the same.<br />Now, TDK and TDKR look amazing (and I could complain about the aspect ratio where it doesn't fill the screen but again that's how they shoot the movie, I get it...just stinks to have a nice TV, blu-ray, and disc and cannot get the full screen--I hate it).<br /><br />Anyway, quick review of the individual movies<br />Batman Begins - 9/10<br />The Dark Knight - 8/10<br />The Dark Knight Rises - 7/10
B0098G7AWS|1.0|This is not a review of the movie, but a comment on a problem with the service. I didn't know who to contact or how to fix the problem when it was happening.  Video got stuck twice inthe beginning of the movie, unable to watch. Please DO NOT charge me.
0345803485|5.0|Great product shipped and received on time before Christmas. Recipient loved the item for a gift. Would recommend product to friends.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great book but I wish that it wasn't so long. I feel like it slowed down too much in the middle. I like the reference to Derry an  the characters from his novel, It.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it, could not put it down. Would recommend it as a read. Can't wait to get the next one!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book. I liked how Charlie spoke and thought about a lot of things other people fail too. Beautifully written!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved it, couldn't put it down, would recommend. A great read and loved purchasing it on my Kindle fire
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure that I would like this book, but I couldn't  seem to put it down.<br />It  was definitely riveting.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved it, could not put it down. Would recommend it as a read. Can't wait to get the next one!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|What a great book on love, and life and learning to balance between your head and your heart. Couldn't put it down.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|I have loved this movie for years.  Though I have never owned it, except for a VHS taped off of cable from years ago, at least once a year I get the urge; and I must watch it.  The premise is so original and Jim Carrey is mind-bogglingly terrific.  I was born in 1958, so I realize that there are many poor souls who have never seen this brilliant film.  Do yourself a favor and watch it with a friend (and a box of tissues).
B009JZTOG8|4.0|The second season is well done, bringing in most of the characters from the previous season.  It gives more of a history of the main characters and makes you want to see what happens in the next episode.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|My son uses this product with his IPAD.  It works great.  This product was shipped quickly.  We have had no problems with this product.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|On my tablet you have to move it side to side to go where u want to go.  Fast paced
0425263916|5.0|Fast and reliable service. This is the second book following Bared to You. So exciting, passionate and witty story. Can't wait for the last book! =D
1603429999|5.0|I have been knitting for several years now and this book has tips for any level of knitter; one cannot know everything; the more books a person has the more experience they acquire. It is important to keep seeking more information to enhance your abilities; this enables one to share what they have learned with others who might be interested in learning. Each one teach one!!  Thanks!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game great graphics. Awesome could not put the game down. Almost felt like I was in the game. Cannot wait fir the sequel. Great job to the creator if this game!
B0094KF4WG|5.0|I started out reading the book sceptical of what I would learn about the mission. I was pleasantly surprised with the detail disclosed, the story telling and the in depth account of what took place. The recount of the authors journey leading to Osama mission was inspiring. Well worth the read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I didn't really enjoy all the death but and twists and turns in the book keep you reading we'll into the night.
030758836X|4.0|The plot is interesting, but overuse of the &#34;f&#34; word.  If you can get past that, it is a good read.
B000IF47QA|5.0|I bought this book for my 3rd grade son and was delighted to find that he eagerly read it daily!  He loved the storyline so much, he asked for the rest of the books for Christmas.  Anything that will encourage him to read (I even found him reading it at night after going to bed by flashlight!) is an absolute plus.
0545425115|4.0|These books are real page turners.  The second and third are great too.  A bit predictable in some instances but definitely grittier than a lot of YA fiction.
B009JBZH54|1.0|Watch out, don´t have the movie The Dark Knight Rises, instead include two same disk of special features of the this movie.  It`s unbelievable. Because I live in Colombia can´t back the product.<br /><br />Cuidado, esta versión de cinco discos no tiene la tercera parte de la saga, en lugar trae dos discos repetidos de las características especiales, como vivo en Colombia no me es rentable devolver el producto.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|As a big Sci-fi fan I was excited to watch what I perceived as a high quality movie in that genre, however was let down by the banal dialogue and questionable casting, that not even the cool set and props could rescue.still was able to enjoy the movie for what it was and will be looking for the sequel.
0061726834|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars, because: it was shipped quickly; it was a good quality product; and the storyline was absolutely fantastic. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I can't wait to read the sequel!
1449415881|5.0|A laugh a day. This 2013 issue has a better quality paper and printing than the 2012. . . .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars. I enjoyed the book. I laughed. I cried and I mourned the loss of some characters that grew on me. I would recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy a little bit of romance with the fight or flight routine. Great book. I can't wait to stay the next book in the Hunger Games Trilogy.
1467934925|5.0|If you're genuinely dedicated to learning about economics, buy this book. Keynes is basically the Einstein of economics, there are a lot of other genius economists but Keynes still stands way apart from the rest.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire has always been one of my favorite games on the PC. Now I can play it on my Kindle!

B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Nice production and it arrived right on time for the Holidays. My daughters believe Santa is an awesome guy because of this.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Not crazy about this book. God and Jesus should be called by their names, not Om. It was interesting how he made a miraculous recovery though! My husband did not like it either. I am sorry I spent the money on this book.
B008ELUEQC|3.0|Production and quality are ok and it arrived right on time for the Holidays. I believe the price is to high

B001F6TXME|5.0|You don't have to press hard to snap a picture. I also tried it out on bulb settings and it worked great, I just pressed and easily slid up. It stayed open as long as I wanted it to then slid back down to close shutter. Everything was almost effortless.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book gives a really good insight into the origins of the Master Chief. Also, its version of the battle for Reach makes a lot more sense in context of the other games than Halo: Reach did.
B000SEGHT6|5.0|There's nothing quite like the style of Vonnegut.  I found this novel so interesting that I hardly put it down until I had finished it!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Martin's fantasy epic is tremendous. It's a great LOTR-style story for people who would sooner read pages about a battle or deception than chapters of lore and song. Its fast pace and brutal tale make for a hair-raising read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great book by Vince Flynn.  Looking forward to many more Mitch Rapp books.<br />Also, looking forward to his new series.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A Clash of Kings is a great sequel to the most thrilling fantasy epic ever written. It's fast paced and compelling, and since you now know that no character is truly safe, you fear for every member of the Stark family as they struggle to survive, fight, and prevail over their enemies. The element of fear for these characters makes this a truly exciting novel.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome! Such a great game for anyone that likes puzzles! Keeps you locked in as soon as you start playing!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|My husband thought he knew everything he had coming for Christmas. Well this was the very last present I let him open and he was just blown away. He watches these DVDs every chance he gets.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am so glad I decided to pick up this series! Catching Fire was amazing...it's filled with so many twists and turns that I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to finish up book 3!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I couldn't put it down!!!!! I love the storyline and can't wait to continue reading the series! The suspense is great!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is fun to play, I would like it better if the settler didn't run out energy. the interaction is decent.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I chose this rating because I thought this dictionary was very useful. I would recommend it to many English teachers or various other teachers or professors.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It was just meh...it had its funny moments, too. I know it is just a movie but come on a bear that can talk, smoke weed and have a relationship with a female was a bit too much to believe.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|What a lovely story.  Gruesome but the message behind it is a great read.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I would recommend this book very much.  It was very enjoyable.  A great story which I enjoyed on my Ereader.
B005LAIHCM|4.0|So *that's why* the ones who make out get killed first. This<br />movie pokes fun at the whole genre and while adding an interesting<br />and original twist. Don't watch the previews, just go in there expecting<br />a good horror flick and be pleasantly surprised with the bonus plot.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I loved this book.  I have now read two books by Khaled Hosseini and enjoyed both of them very much.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I can't stand in the ear buds, as my ears are too small and they constantly fall out.  These are a great solution, they stay in place and don't move.  Even when I'm running.  And they're small and light enough to carry around with me every day.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very creative way of telling a story...I was dubious at first, but love hearing it from a dog's perspective. Engaging and impactful.
B003O86FMW|5.0|really good read couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the third book and see what the conclusion to all of this is!!!
B001BZRUR4|4.0|I didn't plow throught this book, but the message and story are inspiring. It is definitely worth reading. Makes you feel inspired to matter and get out of your comfort zone.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I just started using this app and so far so good.  I like that it notifies you if you have won an item and/or have been outbid on an item.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|fun fun i always play it with my cousins! very easy to play on kindle.. much like untold legends for psp which i loved
B008KE3960|3.0|My seven year old played this App a couple of times and never went back to it.  That alone is a rating that speaks volumes!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Read this after seeing the movie and each are very different but with the same storyline. Particularly enjoyed reading the letters. A good read and read through this within a few days.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator! The same size as the kindle fire,works the same as a traditional calculator..sooo easy to use!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A story too good to resist! This is a captivating read that pulls you into the world of kings, queens, lords, mystical creatures, Others, dragons and much more. I am getting ready to start the next one... now.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this is helpful and right at my fingertips.I always have my kindle with me so when I need a quick problem solved this is just a perfect app and it looks great on kindle fire.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My 7 year old loves this game.  She sais it is just like being at Chuck E. Cheese and playing theirs.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down. Finished it within days and I can't wait to start the next one.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|beautiful costumes and scenery, interesting characters well portrayed, holds our interest and we want to see more, enjoying the history
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was a quick fun read that anyone who loves dogs will enjoy and possibly shed a tear or two.
0345803485|2.0|I think it wasnt realistic, the characters had sex way too often even for 20 somethings.The romantic interactions where the same you know how they would start and finish, Good try, but not the best written book.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I highly recommend for fans of math and logic puzzles. Although you can memorize the combos for the smaller numbers, a good aptitude and attitude for math will make this a much more enjoyable experience!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed thus book, much more than the first!  I hope the next one is just as good! Can't wait!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game that was easy to learn but it will take me quite a bit of time to master. I look forward to see what Ndemic comes up with next.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|frankly i wasn't sure if this was going to be a book for me but i just could not  put  it down. good in depth characters with a tough subject matter
B0086QS7N2|3.0|I purchased this work of Rush tunes for a friend as a gift, so I'm not terribly familiar with it, but he told me after listening that he was somewhat disappointed. He felt it didn't meet Rush's standards.
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good book, compares close to fifty shades. Couldn't stop reading! Looking forwArd to next one. Love the romance storyline!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|My wife and I are in our 50's and vividly remember these bands and certainly, better times when they were playing. And such a great mix of melodies. Creative how the writers and directors melded the various songs together to &#34;drive&#34; the production. We enjoyed it so much I bought my wife this Soundtrack, which she loves even more than the movie, I think! She is wearing this CD out in her car. Highly recommended by us if you dig this era music.
B004XVN1T4|3.0|Good story on how spies operate in the cold war.  Not very realistic in the end. Too many people killed and hero succeeds against all odds.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|A sincere and well-crafted work, from an excellent writer who seems to retain great humor and enthusiasm for an ancient and personal subject
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Very long intro of characters. lots of intrique and information about the effect on people living within the powers involved in world war. excellant ending.
0061537969|5.0|What a fun book to read. Family life from a dogs perspective. Good moral judgements help with self examination. A group of guys at our church is reading this together. The author adds a nice touch of humor. A very enjoyable read.
B0019IMVDG|5.0|Violent, language...that said, most interesting, engrossing, story and characters. An absolute most see for anyone who enjoys film. And it is VEGAS!!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I'm somewhat mystified by the overwhelmingly positive response.  Don't get me wrong, its an OK book if you want to read something that doesn't require much effort (I read this while I was reinstalling a computer).<br /><br />The writing was (barely) passable, but I feel that if the author is mocking the writing abilities of others she should pay more attention to her own.  When Sky reads a note that is posted on her locker she comments:  \\"The note was signed by the principal, but I find that hard to believe based on the fact that \\"your\\" was spelled \\"your're\\"...\\"  A scant paragraph later she writes \\"I'm sure the clique of giggling girls behind me that are scantily, yet expensively clad, are expecting my reaction to be to drop my things ...\\"  Now, I'm not the punctuation police but even I know that it should have been \\"... scantily, yet expensively, clad...\\".  There are other errors and awkward sentences and phrasing throughout the story.<br /><br />The book is a veritable garden of \\"cute\\" names.  We have Sky, Six (who is really named Seven), Shayla/Shayna, Breckin (Breckin?), Lesslie, Grayson and Holder.  I spent some time wondering if the author was a  fan of the TV show \\"Blossom\\" since, other than Battlestar Galactica,  that is the only other time I have seen Six used as a name.  But maybe I just don't get out that much and Texas is a hotbed of unusual names.<br /><br />Where the book really disappoints is that half-way through it was easy to see how it was going to end.  Not only that, but the actions of the characters did not ring true to me.  Men who are pedophiles don't typically feel that they have done anything wrong, they are masters of self justification.  And the mechanics of how Karen wound up with Sky were very much glossed over and not very believable.  Similarly, I didn't find that Sky's reaction to making out rang very true - if she had been traumatized that much why did a boy feeling her up make her \\"comfortably numb\\" instead of panicking her?<br /><br />Finally - the whole thing reminded me of a Twilight fanfiction - here we have the \\"bad boy\\" who climbs through the girl's window and watches her sleep, who is reluctant to consummate the relationship, who's lips skim her jawline.  There are twists here that make it different from Twilight, of course, and maybe this is just coincidence, but there was a definite resemblance.
B0094K1K42|2.0|Charlize....wanted to like it. Seemed from trailer to have a decent enough plot line to develop but then I watched the movie and it was close to a big fat nothing. Even Charlize in full dress was not enough to save this. Perhaps written for women?? I do not recommend.
B001JP5JRY|5.0|This is the first thing I've read cover to cover in one sitting in quite a while. Completely worth it.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|You know how you can listen to the first 30 seconds of a new song and just know if you like it or not or if at least it is interesting enough to keep listening for a while?? Well could never get past \\"30 seconds\\" on this one. I have tried but just, absolutely, nothing pinged in me. See it got some great reviews so perhaps this movie was just not intended for me, whatever that means. I am a 66 year old male. So pay your money and take your chances. I did not like it.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Movie was ok; the HD quality was great.  Would recommend this if you are looking for an interesting movie on one of these snowy winter days.
B00464F19Q|5.0|Violent and language....that said, a most excellent murder mystery with Pitt and Freeman. This movie brought Freeman into main stream movie making and he is most excellent in his character. Not a \\"date for wife\\" movie but if you love good movie making, must see this one.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The second season is wonderfully twisted. The story takes place in an insane asylum, and the tale is told with a majority of the same actors from the first season. It touches upon different horrific perspectives and events than the first season and in it's own way, remains refreshingly new.
B008Y6YLBG|3.0|A very cold, slow, drama. Artsy flick, perhaps, but no way a must see. If you are not aware of poverty and what it looks like out in the country, then perhaps you should watch some of this but otherwise, just not enough of anything in this movie that desires attention. Was so shocked with ??? lead girl/lady was nominated for Academy Award for her role, acting. If you a big, slow drama, fan, watch it, otherwise, skip this one.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Item arrived nice and quick. And the series is a nail biter!! Absolutely awesome. I'm not a huge fan of 24... But this one got me glued to the screen!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Violent and language but most excellent characters and story of mob guys. Like the movie \\"Casino\\" or \\"The Godfather\\" series in its raw view. Not a \\"date or wife\\" movie but very entertaining. Love good movie making, then see this one.

B003XMXZCW|5.0|I've only seen the redux version so far but it's truly amazing. The visual and audio are first class and of course it's a classic (but disturbing) film.<br />Great use of surround and the conversion to blu ray is well done.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I am a big fan of series and enjoying being able to watch characters grow over a long amount of time. Crossed was a good follow-up to Matched and put some new ideas into the plot that I had not seen coming. Connections were made between this book and the first that really allowed you to see that Condie has planned the plot out very well. The levels of violence and drama certainly escalated in this book but in a neccessary way. It is more fast paced than the first book and, if you havn't read the first one I recommend doing so before you start on Crossed. Can't wait to see where this all ends up in Reached.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Despite being a great admirer of musicals, for whatever reason, I never got into the whole \\"Les Miserables\\" fandom. Perhaps this stems from the fact that I find the voices of the principle cast members from the original London and Broadway recordings less than enjoyable. What selections I had heard sung by other vocalists interested me in the music; and, not having seen the show live on stage, I went into this film with not much in the way of expectations. When I came out, I was more than impressed; I was blown away. The music was wonderful, the costumes and sets gorgeous, and the acting...Well, let's just say that more than a few Oscar statuettes are going to be passed around between this marvelous cast.<br /><br />For those who don't know it already, the story of \\"Les Miserables\\", written by Victor Hugo in 1862 and set in France in the first half of the 19th century, concerns Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a convict, out on parole after spending 19 years in jail for stealing a loaf of bread. After the intervention of the kindly Bishop of Digne (played by Colm Wilkinson), who convinces him to \\"become an honest man\\" and foster a belief in God, the story follows him as he attempts to escape from his past life--and the dogged Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe)--his interactions with various characters, and the repercussions that these interactions will have. Like the title suggests, the film is not a jolly, old-fashioned, toe-tapping extravaganza. Most of the film is either heart-wrenching or gut-wrenching, oftentimes both, and isn't afraid to deliver tough emotional blows one after the other; yet, despite the overabundance of death and despair, I was inexplicably uplifted and inspired in a way that only a good musical can achieve.<br /><br />It was a genius decision on director Tom Hooper's part to have the actors sing live instead of favoring the more traditional method of recording in a studio and lip-synching later. They are much more \\"in-the moment\\", and bring a moretruthful sound to the music. While they seem to be a bit more restrained than if they were live on stage, which, for anyone who is used to the typically, big, bold sound of Broadway, might be a little disconcerting at first, it makes the performances so much more raw and real than what one typically expects to find in a movie musical; and with almost every song from \\"Les Mis\\" being more of a soliloquy with instrumental accompaniment than anything else, it works like a charm. Hopefully this will set a precedent for movie musicals in the future.<br /><br />Even if you think you know the songs already, it's like hearing them for the very first time, they sound so fresh and unique, with elegant yet unobtrusive new orchestrations and thrilling vocal performances across the cast. Anne Hathaway's bravura, one-take rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" brought me to tears, and Hugh Jackman's \\"Bring Him Home\\" is quite possibly the most beautiful and touching version I have ever heard. The new song \\"Suddenly\\", written by the musical's original composers especially for this film, is excellent, adding some much needed optimism to the score (as well as a nice breather!), and is perfectly suited to its place in the film--sung by Valjean after he has rescued little Cosette from the cruel Thenadiers. Jackman brings a deep poignancy and tenderness to the lyrics, which might be due to the fact that he is an adoptive father in real life.<br /><br />Although most of the dialogue is sung-through rather than simply spoken, the acting is as good or better than in a regular, non-musical drama. Anne Hathaway will break your heart as the unfortunate Fantine, who is forced to sacrifice everything she has for the sake of her child. Her acting ability has really reached new heights, and don't even get me started on her singing. The few pieces to which she contributes her voice to had me bawling my eyes out. If anyone deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar this year, it's her.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is so good as the reformed convict Jean Valjean it would be hard to imagine anyone but him in the part. At last, he has been given a role worthy of his prodigious talents--the only thing he doesn't do here is dance! He so completely becomes the man, transforming himself into a nearly-unrecognizable shadow in the first part of the film, it is almost impossible to tell where Valjean begins and Jackman ends. His voice is powerful and thrilling, and he does a great job of making each song his own. I could listen to him all day. Even if you don't like musicals, you should still see this, if only to enjoy his stellar performance.<br /><br />The rest of the cast are also uniformly incredible, including Eddie Redmayne, a total musical surprise to me, who, as Marius, is a great romantic lead; Samantha Barks as the poor, heartbroken Eponine; Russell Crowe as the conflicted, duty-bound Javert (who knew he could sing?); and the incomparable Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as M. and Mme. Thenadier, who provide a much-needed, if slightly Sweeney-Todd-esque, comic relief to what would otherwise be non-stop despair. The only weak link in the chain is Amanda Seyfried as Cosette--her voice is quite thin--but wasn't so bad that it ruined my enjoyment of the songs. It was also great to see Colm Wilkinson, the original Jean Valjean, as the Bishop of Digne.<br /><br />What I found most refreshing about this production is that director Tom Hooper isn't afraid to let this film be what it is, a big screen adaptation of a musical--loud, theatrical, often implausible, and unashamedly heart-tugging--yet for all its broadness, the overall feeling is of something quite intimate, not nearly as bombastic and overblown as the trailers would have you think, and very character-driven. It is the music and the emotions that are epic, not the movie itself. Just as he did with \\"The King's Speech\\", he makes you become so deeply connected to the characters themselves that you're ready and willing to be manipulated to experience any emotion on their behalf. Case in point, by the finale, I was weeping like a child. While he might have gone a bit overboard with the whole steadycam/closeup thing, it really does put you right in the middle of the action--how often do you go to a live performance where you can see the tears in the actors eyes before they've even fallen down their cheeks?<br /><br />The only real problem I had with the movie was with the plot itself (too many characters dying tragic deaths, too much melodrama, too much focusing on the student revolutionaries, and, towards the latter end, too much time spent behind barricades and in cafes instead of fighting). All of this drags the film out a little longer than it should, but it is Victor Hugo after all, and his work is the epitome of French literature. For anyone worried about content, there wasn't really anything worse than what you might see in your average PG-13 movie, no real nudity, and only brief language, but some of the scenes involving prostitutes were a little excessive at times, and certainly not necessary to deepen my emotional connection with the main characters.<br /><br />To conclude, \\"Les Miserables\\" is a real masterpiece, with a fabulous cast and some of the most beautiful music ever written. I can't say any more about this film other than that is an emotional rollercoaster, and if you can ride it out, it is well worth the trip. Just be prepared to have lots of tissues on hand when you do.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|I started our reading this book thinking that it would be a light read and a switch form my normal type of book. I loved Tina Fay's Bossypants and thought that this book would be along the same lines. I have to say that I did not enjoy it. There were moments I cold realate too but certain things really turned me off...I can appreciate brutal honesty about being a women and motherhood but I could not relate to the partying and drinking (I did have some fun in college, I am not against it) and she lost me after singing the praises of her abortion. I repsect her for her honsety but I couldn't go on reading after that. It was written well and as I said it had things that I enjoyed but, overall it just isn't for me...and I can't recommend it to any of the women I know.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|super light and functional.  one tip: turn off the kindle before closing the flap on the touchscreen otherwise the touchscreen registers the interior flap as touch activation and will stay on and drain the battery.  I learned this the hard way the first few days.  after i figured that out though i fell in love with the cast.  its very sturdy yet light to the point i barely notice it.  plus the stand is the best part since i use to just prop the kindle up against something to view videos.  i got a good deal too through amazonlocal, 30% off.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|these books are awesome. Keeps you interested from beginning to end, can't put the book down. a must read for women and men!!!

B003ASLJO0|5.0|Walt Kowalksi is a recently bereaved widower who has two sons who don't get along with him, spoiled grandchildren who don't respect him, a young Catholic priest who is trying to reform him, and to top it off he has some Hmong neighbors that he wishes weren't there.  He is also a decorated Korean War vet who doesn't much like anybody  and more so anyone who is Asian that falls into the category of \\"gook.\\"  Walt also is a big believer of carrying a gun, displays the American flag, and is a big proponent of justice.  This becomes apparent when a Hmong gang threatens the family next door and tries to pursuade the son, Thaong to steal Walt's prize posession, a 1972 Gran Torino.  Walt also happens to be a retired auto worker.  Thaong's family persuades Walt to hire the boy to make reparations for what he has done.  Walt reluctantly agrees and at the same time starts to become a mentor to this young man who is afraid of this gang of thugs but is motivated to work and pick up some of Walt's colorful phrases and become a bit more confident.  Sue, Thaong's sister initially tries to make friends with Walt which he resists at first.  \\"Keep your hands off my dog,\\" he says as she comes up on the porch.  \\"Don't worry, we only eat cats,\\" is her reply.  The Hmong gang never goes away and there is a point when Walt can't avoid getting even more involved. Clint Eastwood portrays Walt in a way that I can't imagine any other actor being able to do.  Granted he also produced and directed this film.  It's a good story with several lessons on being a good neighbor, having courage to do the right thing, and reaching out to other cultures can leave you fulfilled.

B00APUQPX6|3.0|Found the movie a little boring... I guess it doesn't help that we had just watched Happy Feet the night before and the concepts are so similar. There are some cute parts, but overall, we weren't impressed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't get enough of colleens books!!! She's such an amazing writer I'm hopeful for what other things she had in stored for her readers!
B0096DZKZC|4.0|this game is amazing in almost every aspect. The views are gorgeous, the levels are fun and tails adds some great help. The controls were made by people that hate you.<br /><br />It's actually not so bad, but you get tthe feeling that the controls were suposed to artificially increase the difficulty. The game is plenty challenging as it is, so this isn't needed. Touch controls are always iffy, but these are usually over come by allowing the controls to register where your thumb is at.<br /><br />This game does not do that. Instead the controls stay in the same place which is a problem when you want to perform quick actions. The controls can feel laggy at times and more than once you'll be screaming at Sonic to go the other way and wonder where he's headed, or you'll be trying to dodge (Gah, the airplane level!)  and the game will not register that you pressed anything.<br /><br />Regardless, the controls were the only true downside to an otherwise flawless game. It was truly a console release and not simply a tablet app. Despite the controls, I urge any Sonic fan to check this out! You will have fun, even when you're watching Sonic duck, even though you think you're pressing right. Cant wait for an Episode III if there is one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't help but say this is one of the best apps I've ever bought its awesome it's not as good as the full version but there getting there it still has work but they will get it done  he THIS game even know it cost so much
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really loved the book.  Loved the story line. The characters were wonderful.  Wondering if there'll be a follow up book.
B000P0J09M|5.0|this movie has a great cast of characters, such as robert deniro and joe pesci all actors/actresses did an ammzing performance. and its directed by martin scorsese, one of the Best directors of all time.
B0094WK9GU|5.0|This cd is perfect, you can listen to all day. Its a awesome cd. My husband enjoy his favorite song \\"don'T you worry child\\" he keeps playing it over and over does not get tired of this CD.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|another great movie by martin scorsese. another great role for robert deniro. and this is one of my favorite movies ever made.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Loved this book. SK is so great at painting a lovely picture of the people and the situations they encounter so well.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|My son received this as a Christmas gift and was so excited to play it. I was excited too because I thought it might be a fun game to play together as a family. I couldn't have been more wrong! The plastic pieces are junk and don't stand or stack like they are supposed to. After we each took a turn trying to build what was shown on the card, we were all so frustrated that the game was over and the kids just started launching the birds back and forth. They apparently forgot to have any product testers try this before putting it on the market, because there is no other possible excuse for the horrendous quality of this game!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was a great book as the title says. Lots of twists and turns.<br />It was definitely worth the money.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Very entertaining. Looking forward to Season 3.<br /><br />Sorry but I don/t think you should tell me how many words I need to use, however, it would not let me submit without more words.  I feel my first words told the story.<br /><br />So here are your extra words.  And ya kind of ruined it for me.  So there!!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Another masterpiece from the master himself. takes off right from the start and just spirals out from there.  Well worth the time
B003UY0ZFS|5.0|I really enjoyed this album from the beginning to the end. It has jazzy rythms which vary through the cd.Her voice reminds me of Sheryl Crow's.
B0093QFM6Y|4.0|I've always enjoyed this movie version of Phantom. It's visually appealing, the characters are likeable, and the songs work for the most part. My biggest complaints are the vocal work of the male lead (Gerard Butler) and some plot issues, but these can be overlooked in order to appreciate the music and the rest of the film. Also, while there is supposedly dubbing of Minnie Driver's singing (due to her lack of opera training), I've never found this noticeable enough to be distracting.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This movie could have been a real snoozer, but it was written, directed, cast, and acted well.  A really good piece of entertainment and family friendly too.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I love this product. It's inexpensive and well made and does the job. It's compact, low profile and has a magnetic base to attach it to the vehicle's roof or any other ferrous metal surface. Another nice feature is it has a small status LED on the edge of the unit that indicates if it has a lock on the satellites - blinking - no lock; steady - locked. I first launched my Topo map application and set the USB port for the correct data settings. I plugged in the unit and within 10 seconds had a 3D lock. Accuracy was dead on even though I was on the first floor of my two-story home. The unit also held the lock and was tracking between 9 and10 satellites, again within my house. I know there is a newer version of this receiver with a later version of the SiRF Star chipset for just a little more money and that might be something to consider.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Not very innovative or striking (no pun intended).  Seems that ol Clint is too much in a groove with his 'old-guy proves his worth' schtick.
160774273X|5.0|I've been baking yeast breads and pizza crusts for over 30 years, and these simple techniques are a revelation.  The language here is simple, the pictures clear, but it's not a beginner's book.  This text clarifies, simplifies, and demolishes methods many of us have used for years.  They take less time and effort, but they are not shortcuts.  Skill is required to pull off these approaches, but the results are what I think many of us have been on the trail of for years, and once you've gone through the steps once, I bet it will all fall into place.  The overnight pizza dough in particular will change your baking life.  Now if I could only find a copy!  Had one out from the library for six weeks and am still trying to buy one.  Every year brings a hot bread bible, but this one might be the trump card.

B0013ND30M|5.0|I had forgotten that Disney doesn't put these movies out for sale on a regular basis, so I ordered a brand new one here, and love it!
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Tarantino's \\"Django Unchained\\" is a journey into the heart of darkness, filled with blood, gore, and great performances from all the cast. Jamie Foxx stars as Django, a slave turned free by a bounty hunter named Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz. Doc Schultz and Django go looking for some bad men, so Schultz can kill them and collect the bounty. After the deed is done, Schultz helps Django find the slave-owner who owns Django's wife. The film unfolds from there, and I will let the viewer learn for himself/herself as to what happens.<br /><br />I will say this: the movie is incredibly violent, probably the most violent Tarantino film since Reservoir Dogs, and Kill Bill Vol. 1. As a Tarantino fan, I consider both Kill Bills to be one film, so I will say taking that into account, Django Unchained is as violent as Reservoir Dogs. The performances in this movie are excellent. DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson, as the plantation owner Calvin Candie and his servant Steven, are the best in my opinion.<br /><br />The film is an homage to violent Spaghetti Western movies from the 60s and 70s. If you're a fan of Spaghetti Westerns, you will probably enjoy the movie. There are close-ups of some of the characters that will remind Western fans of the \\"close-ups\\" Sergio Leone used in the Fistful of Dollars trilogy. While many of Tarantino's movies are told in a non-linear narrative structure, meaning the film isn't necessarily presented as a beginning-middle-end, \\"Django Unchained\\" is told in a very straight-forward way. The film follows a path of beginning to middle to end.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect however. I think the set-up to Django searching for his wife takes a little too long to develop. Also, most of the secondary characters aren't well developed. We don't understand why Steven is so loyal to Candie. We don't know much about Django's wife, either. Despite those flaws, this is still a powerful film that successfully describes the true horror of American slavery.

B004VYYA2K|4.0|My 4 year old daughter has enjoyed this product.  The handles are nice and she can carry her barbies up and down the stairs.  I used some small containers for all the shoes and accessories and keep those in the box as well.  The lid is useful since it has a rim to keep all those little trinkets contained while she is playing on the carpet.

B000NY17J6|5.0|Linda Ronstandt's music provides the Perfect Balance between Rock and Country. This CD collection contains 23 of her best songs on one CD which is is a real bargain! I enjoy every single song in this collection which is a rare thing to say for musical CDs published today. I have already listened to this numerous times. Every song on this CD brings back fond memories of songs I grew up with. Even though I've always prefered rock music over country, I enjoy her country songs as much as her rock songs. The audio on this CD is perfect too. If possible, I would have given it 6 stars.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was perfectly written! It took me less than 24 hours to finish it because I was hanging on to every word. It doesn't sugar coat any of the awful events these characters had to endure and I think that's why I was able to connect to them so easily; I felt their pain too. I laughed, cried and felt sick to my stomach all from this well written, extremely enjoyable book. Bravo!

B0052RDHTM|4.0|I started reading this book and within 10 minutes I was hooked. When away from the book, I couldn't wait to get back to it to discover what would happen next. Loved it! The only reason that I gave it four instead of five stars is that I got bogged down in all the details of the fighting in the war chapters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Pros:<br />Really is Minecraft<br />Smooth Interface<br />Survival is Fun<br />Cons:<br />Only LAN Multiplayer<br />No Chat in Multiplayer<br />Its worth the money and in future updates it will get better.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|If you like the Alien series or great visuals, Prometheus is a must see.<br /><br />Although according to Ridley Scott it wasn't meant to be a direct prequel, you can definitely catch some connections. The plot is solid (although it does leave you with more questions than answers; they are planning a sequel or two as of my last check), the acting is amazing, and the visuals are incredible. Along with Avatar, Tron: Legacy, and The Avengers, Prometheus was my favorite 3D movie to see in theaters. They did the 3D effects incredibly well, making sure the effect could be seen throughout the shots.<br /><br />If you've heard some flack for the plot not answering enough, still give this a try. Its pros greatly outweigh any cons, and just remember: there's more to come!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I got this for my Nexus 7 tablet. It works as expected, allowing me to search for and order items, and also to access my previous orders, wishlist, etc.  The user interface is considerably simplified compared to the full browser page version. That's appropriate because most Android devices, smartphones and tablets, have much less screen area to display info.  It's a free app, so there's no downside to trying it out. You may like it. If not, you can always user your browser app to connect to Amazon.com
B005GRF2UK|5.0|Loved this version of Jane Eyre. None of the versions will ever be as good as the book but this is still a very good watch.
0399160450|5.0|The book was a great read though I wish it had involve Jack Ryan Sr. more.Its one I would recomend .
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Just like life..you will laugh and you might cry, and learn about older people, who prove you can and should live life to the full at any age! Brilliant acting, especially Judy Dench and Maggie Smith, a joy.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|i love this game soooooo much and it is very creative,clean,and awesome! When i saw that bt5 was on the kindle i almost  died.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I can never get tired listening to Susan's, amazing voice, well chosen songs, the duetts with her 'idols' : pure joy. Loved her handwritten notes on the cover and inside, how fame and fortune has not changed her, its not about money or image, just the passion for beautiful music..I just want more..
B009GED3HS|5.0|Another great season of how<br />I met your mother I can't wait to see the rest of the season! Love this show!!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Kudos! 3 idiomas and the best clue files system offered in any game so far.  You are in the right track.  keep working so the transcitions are faster between scenes and keep bringing new ways of pasttime<br /><br />kika
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A friend suggested I read this book just yesterday. Luckily today is Sunday, because, yes, I read the entire book today. I literally didn't put the book (e-reader) down once. I loved all of the emotion portrayed so well. I laughed out loud often but also cried some too. I'm very impressed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|AWESOME!!<br />Can't wait to read book three. It should be good. NEVER SAW THIS ENDING COMING! Loved it so much.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very suspenseful and intriguing. Great read, I could hardly put it down.  Anxiously awaiting the next wool. Five stars from me.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book! A lot of fun to read it on Kindle and to know I have it all the time!
B009FOBMBI|3.0|Has a few good songs, but I don't think its as good as their earlier efforts.  Just seems more 'poppy' to me.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Movie was predictable, but funny in spots. The combination of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones works, even if it is old jokes.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great app! Energy refills quickly. Keeps me entertained while I`m nursing. The disasters can be a bit monotonous and the Lady Antebellum quests are a bit obnoxious,.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|First of all you have to pay for every single Little thing before you can even play the real game sucker don't get it .
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|THE BEST!  I COULD WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  ALL THE SUPERHEROES ARE GREAT!  LOVED IT!  AND SO DID MY 6 YEAR OLD GRANDSON.
1451695187|3.0|I found the story a bit confusing at times, too much medical mumble jumble. hard to figure out just what he (author) was trying to convey.
0451232852|5.0|This is the 4th. Book I've read by Ken Follett and each one is better than the last. I have Winter Of The World next on my list.
B00899BKGC|3.0|Mike Stern takes a little time to get use to. My last album of him took me months to catch on.  After that, I really like his approach to fusion.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|Movies like Braveheart are a rarity these days, so this special collector's DVD is a good buy. Braveheart stands alone in its place in movie history.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is a very addictive game. I cant wait until the coins come on because I am ready to win points. You are always a winner with coin dozer. You can never fail win playing this great game.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|Gladitor is a must have in any movie collection. It is one of the few movies that is comparable to the likes of BRAVEHEART.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very good. I personally feel that this book is very inspirational. I would definitely suggest this book to a friend.
1609611543|5.0|This book was very informative, Dr. Davis' revelation that wheat is bad and causes all manner ills goes against popular beliefs but it makes sense. I started the weight loss plan on January 1, 2013 and I've lost 3.2 pounds in six days; experienced withdrawal symptoms for 1.5 days but I stuck it out and didn't give into the urge to eat. The book outlines two methods of eliminating wheat from your diet - go cold turkey or gradual. I decided to go cold turkey and glad I did. I'm not constantly eating and I have more energy. This works for me. I bought the cookbook also, but it's not necessary recipes are provided in this book.
1451695195|3.0|For a Christian I found it not quite right with other views of Heaven like &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34;,  If he is a believer then he was shown only what he could comprehend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story was captivating!  Ending was what I wanted. I can't wait for the movie. Did not know about movie or actors portraying characters in book until after I read it.  They will be great!
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|Excellent book.  Riveting from the beginning to the last word.  Eva Delectorskaya is the sort of character you love and hate at the same time.  Great story.  I will definitely read this author again.
0307474259|4.0|Very informative, easy to read yet comprehensive, does a good job explaining the reasearch supporting the information provided.  Includes a non nonsense approach at getting started with a better diet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins did a really good job of describing exactly what was happening in the story. I'm on the edge of my seat waiting to get the second book!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It kept my attention because it was written from the personal experience of a neurosurgeon.  Where most of the time we question and tend to doubt NDE's, Dr Alexander explained with great clarity why some of the things he experienced could not have been the result of fantasies created by his brain.  It was even more convincing because he was aware that many of his colleagues would doubt his experience but after careful thought and consideration he was able to verify the authenticity of his claims. It was an easy read though he used many medical terms to explain what had happened to his brain.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This is a great DVD that we have not stopped watching since Santa brought it.  Can't say enough about it!
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|We bought these to go with a small starter Lego set for our young daughter, and we couldn't be happier. She loves the animals and zoo keeper. Great addition!
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Would highly recommend this CD to any fan of Whitney's. Even if you're not a fan you would enjoy it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This is one of my favorite books amazon suggested.  I initially bought this because it was cheap and Amazon said I'd like it.  I have read this multiple times since getting it, and love it more and more every time.  Definitely a quick read.  You can't help but fall In love with her characters, and hope that everything works out.
0385535139|5.0|I have always been a big fan of John Grisham's and have read all his earlier books. Can't wait to read this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read her other two books easily a dozen times each because I love the, both so much.  So when I found out about this new book, I wasted no time getting it, and read it in four hours without even realizing it.  This book is so well written and captivating.  The story itself not only will suck you in, but how the story plot is arranged is just as wonderful.  For those who commented about the darkness of the plot, it is clearly listed as being suggested for those over 17 for content reasons.  The main character is so well developed and seems so real, it's hard not to feel as if you are in the story.  This book had me everywhere from smiling to crying and back again.<br />I highly recommend this book, you won't be disappointed.
B007704HO6|4.0|As an animal lover, friend of several friends in recovery, and a northern Nevadans who has never been to London I found this to be a pleasant read with the right amount of back story.  I I found out a lot about life in London and found myself invested in James & Bob's story from beginning to end.  It was also a nice break from the heart wrenching tear jerking pet stories!  Here's to continuing the high road journey of recovery and friendship to Bob and James.  Cheers!
B00A80SHFM|2.0|After seeing the movie, there were songs I thought I liked, so I went ahead and ordered the soundtrack from Amazon. It was cheaper to order the actual audio CD than it was to just buy the MP3 version from iTunes at least.<br /><br />While I was waiting for the CD to arrive I was listening to various incarnations of the songs and I've been spoiled by the singing I've heard on those.<br /><br />I know it's very hard to compare a movie to a Broadway or concert version, but it's inevitable when such strong singers have taken on some of these roles and done the songs sooo well. My favorite was the 25TH Anniversary concert and after listening to the music from that an inordinate amount of times in the past week, I am completely disappointed.<br /><br />I know the focus of the filmmakers was the acting and the story, but I really wish they'd have put more effort into the music. They don't do it any justice. Most of the cast is actually very talented and it's a shame that their voices are so muted on the soundtrack.<br /><br />Almost everyone in the cast is actually a really talented singer, (I'm ignoring Russel Crowe for the moment) and you would never know it from listening to this.<br /><br />The only songs from this album that I'm probably going to keep on my playlist are \\"Empty Chairs...\\", \\"Drink with Me\\", and \\"ABC...\\" because I think those songs suffered the least from the choices made by the filmmakers. I can't even listen to Anne Hathaway do \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\". It's too weak and there's too much sniffling for me to enjoy the song. Some of my favorite songs from the show, \\"One Day More\\", \\"The Confrontation\\", and \\"Look Down\\" just didn't work here, which is so frustrating.<br /><br />They've also cut some songs; \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\", is one of my favorites, and it's not on here, though I do remember cringing through the way that song was done in the move, so perhaps it's for the best.<br /><br />Gavroche also appears to be absent which is a shame.<br /><br />I feel like allowing the cast the freedom to act their parts live while singing really killed the music, which is kind of the point of a musical. I'm not sure why the versions on the album couldn't be recorded in the studio and done to the best of the singers' ability, even if live singing was the better choice for the filming. I don't remember being as upset with the music while watching it, so I think the music was fine for the visual movie version, it just fails as an audio CD.<br /><br />That combined with the songs nixed don't really make this album worth it. Go with the 10th CD since they don't even offer the 25th concert as an audio CD.like allowing the cast the freedom to act their parts live while singing really killed the music, which is kind of the point of a musical.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really hope she decides to write the trilogy from Christians POV. That would be amazing! I would love to see further into his dark side.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|this game is really fun and you can play so many songs that are so hard you cant even play them but its still very fun. I recommend this app highly.
0865479410|5.0|As a psychologist this is an area that interests me for professional reasons, in addition to being a human being who just wants to be happy.  This book was an excellent read that appealed to the professional in me with constant citing of research studies, but also was an enjoyable read that any person could pick up and appreciate.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I have seen this movie before, but it has been quite some time.  After receiving the movie we sat down to watch it for what seemed like the first time.  I had forgotten so much, it was very exciting!  Must see!
B005QUQP76|1.0|Let's start off with the build quality of this mouse. It's fantastic. It feels like a solid piece of equipment and was very comfortable to use. I've rarely been pleased with the feel of a mouse out of the box, but this mouse felt comfortably in my hand and on the screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after a scant four months, it began to stop tracking. The buttons continued to work, but the cursor wouldn't move anymore. At first, it happened once every couple of days. Unplugging and plugging it back in instantly resolved the problem. It wasn't a huge deal.<br /><br />A few weeks later and what was a nuisance became unbearable. Updating the firmware and installing the newest drivers did nothing. Running the mouse without the software did nothing. It would just stop tracking multiple times a day.<br /><br />Now, a little more than 5 months into owning this mouse, it stops tracking on an hourly basis. Sometimes, it'll stop every ten minutes or so.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this mouse, but when hardware by Madcatz lasts three times as long? It's really unfortunate as this mouse could have been excellent.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just another amazing book read! I can't wait to start the third book. It took less then 24hrs to finish this one and I'm sure the next will be no different
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book just blew me away; it was one of the most amazing stories I have read.  It makes you go through so much emotion, makes you laugh, cry and I literally did not want this book to end.  I loved Sky and Holder so much.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Like the game but it has it's moments I was up to level 34 with 200plus friends and now I'm at level 8 with 30 friends. Like the game
B00ANT6OK8|3.0|There is a classic photo of Obama,Clinton and others in a conferance room nervously awaiting news of the success of the hunt for Bin Laden floating around .I thought this film would've been so much better had it included Obama and his staff(actors of course)and their involvement in the days leading up to that night and even as they awaited the outcome that night.Phone calls. Anything !! I mean it was if his staff didn't exist or had nothing to do with that glorious night. This is a good film,personally,because of the reason i've mentioned I found it lacking.I would've loved to have seen a scene where the president asked questions about the certainty of Bin Laden being in the compound,him and his staff pondering the decision,giving the go ahead,nervously awaiting(as in the photo described above),then euphoria when the news came in that the mission had been a success!!! Listen,its a good film,worth seeing,I just think the film makers missed a chance to make this film a classic by not including Obama(except for a 30 sec clip)and his staff having a more important role(and in real life they did)in the movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The puzzles and story was very well put together. The graphics were also pretty impressive.  I plan on playing it more than once. The achievements are worth trying to get.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app which works well on kindle fire.  Hard to believe it is free but I am glad because I hate paying for apps especially if I don't get to try first.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless  is an inspiring, funny, realistic story which shows the both heart breaking and warming complexities of life. It did exactly what a book should do-- it pulled me in and drenched  me with love , pity, excitement and fear. I'll be rereading  it again soon.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Got a freebie this is a great alarm. Only thing the paid version does is no  ads and multiple alarms.
0525952926|4.0|Those who enjoy history will really enjoy this book.  You will be drawn in by the everyday struggle of families as the holocaust begins.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Although, I don't love the eighth season as much as some of the earlier seasons, the show still has it's foundation intact.  The strong family bond between the Winchester Brothers.  There is always some kind of monster to fight, and that the writers can still find great storylines it amazing.  Love the cast and crew!  Enjoy the show!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|One of the best fantasy series i have ever read. Very long books so do not be scarred off by the price, you get your money's worth and the book is so good, great male and female characters alike.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Like the near simultaneous running of the story line with the last Bourne movie.  This requires liking the Bourne franchise and being very familiar with the previous movies and the threads started years ago.  Therefore, this movie demands concentration as the action are reminders as to what has been done to the men enlisted into the program vs being the center of the story.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Amazing, heartfelt, humorous, couldn't put it down. You gotta read this book. The story is so relatable... Tear wrenching at some points, and it made me laugh at other points. If you want a touching story from the point of view of a surprisingly Intelligent dog, this book is for you.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is my all time favorite app. it's so fast reliable and i just love it. if i could give it a10000 i would.!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is fun and addicting and it barely lags or glitches out and the only bad thing about it is that the graphics are not the best but who cares about graphics
B0031YJFCQ|1.0|I enjoyed the first two books but this one was filled with too much information about the government departments etc.  I am not sure I will finish this last book as it is not anything like the first two.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|She loves anything Tinkerbell, so of course she loves this! She's watched it over and over, like any new movie.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love that I can go from the dictionary to the encyclopedia and they onto a medical dictionary if need be.  Quite useful!
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|My 12 year old son is in love with this. Not to mention, Amazon's price was about $10 cheaper than anywhere else! It can use the regular Nerf bullets, but they just don't go as far. We purchased additional magazines and bullets, as well.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Sometimes the music did not play but when it does it sounds beautiful.  Keeps your fingers working but be careful if you have long nails.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very easy read that grabs you from the start!!!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes the suspense/ mystery genre!
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I read a version of this in French many years ago and loved it.  However, this appears to be a literal translation from the old French and is really difficult to grasp.  I do not remember all of the historical detail of the war.  I haven't finished it and don't know if I will.  I checked after I got it and the translator of another version even commented(without naming names) on the difficulty in reading it.  I felt better that it wasn't me. I may purchase another version and hopefully be able to read it.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|excellent CD.  the inclusion of the first 3 songs make it worth the price.  skip buying the jacket, though, ace.
B004SEVPWQ|3.0|I would have rated pool break pro 5 stars but for some reason it won't let me sign in to play my Facebook friends...Tells me \\"pool break pro is misconfigured for Facebook.\\" I've uninstalled and reinstalled both pool break pro app and Facebook app. I'm playing on my kindle fire hd 7'' please help! Thanks!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I started playing this game today and can't put it down. It is so much fun and once I got into the higher levels some really challenged me. Loving this game
B001OB7R7S|5.0|Steely Dan, need I say more?  This is Donald Fagen's solo work, but he can't get away from the sound that made him famous.  Moreover, he shouldn't try to.  I have this album and decided to purchase the CD ( I missed the tunes).  From &#34;I.G.Y&#34; to &#34;Walk Between The Raindrops&#34;, this CD is solid.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Beautifully written, clever plot, well researched, finished it in three days. Big fan of Kate Morton.... Similar in approach to The Distant Hours
B0098WVT9W|5.0|Let's begin with &#34;Fat Albert Rotunda&#34; what a cool song and title and Ritenour cooks!  If you miss the artwork that albums used to have, then this CD comes with an awesome (adobe acrobat) digital booklet that lists the musicians and has some great photos.  Captain Fingers is doing what he does best--pushing the boundaries and taking us with him.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game....thought it was too easy at first but the more you play the harder it gets. Its a just all and all a great game!
B00A757EFW|3.0|LOVE The game! Hate the free edition. You get to play one level. Once again, free not worth it. Purchase the full game if you love pac man.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Gutwrenching. Beautiful. This book takes you to hell and back, but man is it an awesome journey! Highly recommended read if you can stomach the heart ache.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|killer movie and killer soundtrack, MUST OWN for anyone that enjoys good movies. However, if you are someone that enjoys fast and the furious garbage movies then stay clear from this movie because you will not understand it.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Good movie. See it. Some of the humor was just plain gross, so you have to be in a not-so-serious mood.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|if you like graphic novel games, then buy this! this is totally a sleeper hit cult game that will be remembered for years to come
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like it but you need friends to move alone faster and you need to spend money to get rid of some obstacles. Other than that I like the game
B00011D1OA|5.0|It arrived so fast.  My daughter-in-Law loved it.  It was her Christmas gift and she had been looking for the DVD for a while.  Thanks.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked it, but it was very much like 'Sleeping with the Enemy' (the book and movie).  An easy read with just the right amount of everything.  Do yourself a favor though, don't read the reviews with the spoilers.  It ruined it for me.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Sure, we may have a hard time understanding Stallone's dialogue, but that's what subtitles are for right? With the exception of Rocky 5, it is a good film series depicting a fighter starting out in his humble roots, his rise to fame, his demise, and his return to his humble roots.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|I love this game. I highly recommend this very fun game to anyone. I love Zombies and Biohazard. This game exceeds my expectations.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Old or young, every one needs to see Indiana Jones. A tribute to the many adventure films in the past in which we don't see too often anymore along with Harrison Ford. Sure the films may have their silly moments, but there's a reason for the word fiction.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|After the first chapter, I could not put this book down. Definitely worth taking the time to read. The detail and intensity in the writing made me feel like I was experiencing what Sky was experiencing.
B009FZFONO|5.0|You can only watch Walking Dead Season 3 on iTunes or Amazon (as of 1/7/13).  Great quality and easy to use function on the PS3.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Jodie Forest in Contactis just awesome.  She plays her part well and this is a great movie to sit back and just enjoy the science and fantasy!
B003VS0CXS|5.0|I love when I can get the two disc combos for Blu ray and regular dvd players! My son loves musicals and this is a great combo at a good price
B003Y5H556|5.0|Wow!  Red Riding hood is a different kind of Red Riding we grew up with but very entertaining.  Don't knock it!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Looks great in HD<br />Great movie<br />No problems with streaming our rental at all<br /><br />I cant wait to purchase a trilogy package in HD in the future
B0076DELIG|4.0|You can relax and be comfortable knowing that Harry Bosch will be your reliable L.A.detective.<br /> A few minor adjustments and a whole lot of excellent police work will keep you coming back for more.Kudos to Connelly!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Clancy's THREAT VECTOR - I'm about 70 complete and I can't put my Kindle down.  Fast acting suspence . Even has a few twists and turns.  It keep you on the seat of your pants.
B005721W9O|5.0|If the dreariness of constant betrayal gets to you, Galaxy Quest is a great antidote.  It pokes fun while underscoring the virtues of faith in something bigger than oneself.  We always feel better after watching it (every few years.)
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|This is not just a kids' movie. It is one that anyone can enjoy. The disk works perfectly fine and everything was in great condition.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I started watching the HBO series, The Game of Thrones and I was captivated. My only regret is that  I hadn't read the books first.<br /><br />If you liked the TV show (or even if you haven't seen it), do yourself a favor and pick up his books! I was truly impressed with all of the detail and imagination put into these. I have never liked books with different character's perspectives until this one. Each character's view is so unique and it is much more interesting to see it through their eyes then the directors.<br /><br />While the books and TV show follow along nicely, there is only so much that they can include in a 40-60 minute episode. You will find so much more depth and interactions in the author's books.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is a series that I will find myself coming back to again. I am currently on the 4th book and still as satisfied as I was on the first one.
B0086700CM|5.0|best app ever. get the app. you dont have to spend money on the in app purchases because it is not that hard. i have gotten a million points lots of times.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Couldn't put it down a very good read. There were many twists and turns and that is what I  like.<br />There were only two things that I didn't like and one is all the political prose. Also one of the key players<br />Adam Yao was left hanging at the end and I felt should have had a blub as to what he ended up doing.
B0061S073A|5.0|I was excited about my kindle fire for Christmas, and that I could buy so many apps for my son (4yrs) to help him with his school lessons. That was until he reset it 3 or 4 times. # :(  I was having a hard time finding an app that worked.  We downloaded this free app and it is PERFECT!!  It's easy to use, add apps, remove apps, and it is password protected so that he cannot leave his &quot;kid place&quot;  and reset and change or download.  I would recommend this app to anyone with children.  It works great, definitely invented for parents!  You will love it so download it now!
B0041KKYH4|3.0|Recently purchased Bad Teacher and had been wanting to see it for quite some time due to the Previews being funny and of course a carwash scene with Camron Diaz, well, that's about the best part of this movie, the previews, story line is dumb, Unrated version is just alot of cussing that does not fit.  Behind the scenes is a bunch of fluff to make then say they have a behind the scenes section.  If you can find this at a rental price , then get it, other than that, it's worth a buck to see a bit of Camron Diaz and listen to her talk dirty in the first few minutes of the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its just a simple plain calculator. Its so easy to use!! And that is just the way i like it :)
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Light and profound at the same time, wonderful scenes from India capture what I have experienced on a visit there, fantastic acting.  A must see!

B008PWUT9M|4.0|I guess my only disappointment is that I didn't realize that Kindles have different sizes.  My next disappointment was that it would cost more than I'm willing to spend to send this cover back.  Otherwise, if it were the right size, I would have been satisfied.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I picked up this book for the Kindle on one of the daily deals.  I hadn't heard of the book nor the author but the reviews tempted me.<br /><br />Hopeless is unlike any book I've ever read.  In the beginning I expected another teenage book like all the others that followed Twilight by Stephenie Meyers.  Except, this one was different.<br /><br />No supernatural elements.  That's just one difference.<br /><br />The intensity of the main characters, Sky and Holden, are complex with hints dropped throughout.  Even so, I didn't see it coming.  Until wham, the rollercoaster started and I couldn't set the book down.  I don't do spoilers, so you'll have to trust me on this one.<br /><br />As with most YA books now there is a gay couple, treated with dignity and normality.  Which was refreshing.<br /><br />Here are the things I can tell you.<br /><br />Sky is a great character.  Smart and unique with the ability to distance her emotions from most teenage encounters.  Rarely cries as she is so controlled however it is not in a cold way.  It's very natural.  Raised by her adoptive mother without TV or computers.<br /><br />Holden has a reputation which is quickly discarded as Sky sees him for who he really is as a person.  However much is hidden from her, and she doesn't know why.<br /><br />Her best friend, Six, is a sassy chick who makes a great impact in the short time she is part of the story.<br /><br />The intensity of the characters brought back every major crush I had as a teenager.  Not that this book is about crushes, it isn't at all.  I just was able to feel and remember how intense my teenage emotions were to the exclusion of everything else.<br /><br />The second half of the book takes you on a fast ride that doesn't let up for a moment.<br /><br />Read this book - it's worth it!
B00637D114|5.0|He have watched this movie on our kindle over and over. Anything that he enjoys is alright with me. Thanks
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Really fun and clever. Being the third in a series is tough but this one delivers.  It is nice that they kept the same actors from the first two.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This was the first ebook that I purchased and read; the process was easy to follow, and while hesitant that reading from my tablet wouldn't be the same experience as from a book, I found it easy and convienent. Looking forward to more ebooks.<br /><br />Plus, Nicholas Sparks did it again with an amazing book!
B002RXZF6C|5.0|Classic horror and the disc really helps convey the way it was filmed and is supposed to look like to appreciate classic horror
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Plot was quite interesting. It was a complex concept, but it kept me watching. I would recommend it to others. It was a great date night movie!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Any walking dead fan has to have this, the whole season plus just the right amount of extras, cant go wrong!

B009JBZH54|5.0|Everything about this product met my expectations.  Widescreen blue ray is all I wanted so this worked out as the perfect gift!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of the best CBM's of 2012, marvel did what few thought they could and made all these iconic characters come together and it made sense and was fun! period!
B003Y74KAW|3.0|This silicone case is quite thin, so I'm not sure how much protection my phone will get from it.  The best things about this silicone case is the color, and the hole in the back to show the Apple.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked the first and second book better. The epilogue was a little confusing in the third book. It was good.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I really like the idea of what you thought of for your own fun book for kids thank you jk
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I would give this 5 stars, but there is no paid ad-free version.  I HATE random advertising as I try to keep up on my blogs and news.  Otherwise, Flipboard is a slick app.  Very responsive and makes it easy to read.  In my opinion, an easier experience than using Pulse.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|this movie was just okay.  Nothing fabulous.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you've seen everything else there is to see.
0545265355|5.0|My sister got me started on this series. My ex was also pleased with this set as was my son. In fact, everyone that I talked to, told me that I needed to have the full set and set aside some time to read it. This I will do!
B0050R0XPA|5.0|I stumbled upon this while searching for something else!  I never knew these Lego Christmas sets existed!  They are absolutely adorable and will become a new collection in our household for Christmas display!  Amazing detail!  Very well done!  We love it!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I saw this movie twice in theaters and rented it as soon as it came out. We watched once with one friend and another time with a different friend.<br /><br />If you liked Bridesmaids, you're going to like this. Lots of singing, but its not cheesy and its not a musical.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just cant get enough of this game. I would love to know more about it though. Is there an end? I will eventually try. out the BRAVE version.<br />good stuff
B000I0QL82|4.0|I had never seen this movie and ordered it simply for the musical aspect (I love watching dancing and singing).  I was wondering why they didn't play this movie on TV during the holiday season until the one scene where the music and dancing were done in black face - yikes!  I get it!  Jeez...if you can deal with this type of old movie craziness then you will probably like the movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very addictive and very fun and better then all the rest. Very very very addictive and very very very very fun
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I loved this book it was amazing.<br />I only had to open the book twice to read it. I really enjoyed it!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is the next best broadway musical to hit the big screen since Phantom of the Opera back in 04 or 05.  It's a must see must have movie that will leave you singing along with the cast.
B001VLXNO2|5.0|This was an extraordinary story of George Mallory and his passion to be the first man to summit Mt. Everest. As history has documented, Edmund Hillary and Tensing Norgay conquered the tallest mountain in the world in 1953. Mallory's two attempts occurred in 1923 and 1924. His body was found in 1999, without a camera or any indication or proof of his success or failure.<br /><br />This novel was captivating from the onset. Perhaps because that part of the world holds a special place in my heart for many reasons. Not the least of which Tensing was my group's guide on my first trip to Kathmandu, Nepal in the 70's. He was an unassuming, quiet, shy man that had lived through these extreme experiences and with the notoriety that he was ill equipped for. He had been hired by Eric Lars Lindblad to be a guide to tourists under a contract he apparently did not completely comprehend. His personal complaint to me in confidence was that many of the promises made to him by Lindblad Tours were not met. I did share as much of my film that I could spare as that was one of the many things he had hoped to have in abundance. He was also kind enough to be my personal porter in that he carried my camera equipment all over Nepal as we were guided throughout the country. In turn, I delivered a small rug to his wife (his third) who was in Siliguri when my group arrived after a horrific landing in West Bengal, India during a monsoon.<br /><br />As a tourist in that part of the world, I was given the opportunity to fly by Mt. Everest for a magnificent view. From our plane it was difficult to really comprehend the magnitude of this mountain and the magic it has held for serious climbers over the last century. On several occasions we were awakened very early in the morning to watch the sunrise and the exquisite pink and purple hues that cover the mountain range of the Himalayas. The experience is breathtaking.<br /><br />Once again, Archer has captivated me with his wonderful writing, beautifuldescriptions and elegant characters. I would give this book a 5 star rating. I couldn't put it down !
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love this game! Its challenging and addictive. I highly recommend it! I spent most of xmas day stuck to my kindle fire.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|The whole idea is refreshingly different, and this is what makes it stand out from the average novel and ensures that the story remains in the mind. Light fantasy that everyone should enjoy.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Repetative. Writing style was convoluted. Some parts seemed contrived and ingenuine. As a Christian Scientist, I wanted to love this book.... I found that impossible.
B001JDS7CU|4.0|I saw some other commentary which was even better and nice than this. But other than that, you cannot beat the content and price. Seller was great.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Although Hunger Games is aimed at teen readers, it's an entertaining book for adults as well. It's a reasonably short book that has an ending that highly encourages the reader to continue the series. As some may already know, it's similar to several other stories in its plot line, particularly a well known Japanese book series also aimed at teen readers.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I have a strong passion for hair design and cutting. This game has it all. I absolutely love it! I totally recommend this game!
B008VNIA32|3.0|So far I've only seen the Valencia (Sci-Fi) production of the Ring. I read the Barenboim/Kupfer version had some of the best musicianship and acting but the production was bland and I think the reviewer was right. I'm not an opera buff so I'm not a judge of singing unless there's a lot of vibrato. The staging was dark and not impressive but the opera's still interesting. Maybe it's good to see a version that doesn't dazzle with special effects so much but I like that stuff. This was recoeded in 1991 I think and the video resolution's not that great. I think my next copy will be the new Metropolitan Production (another &#34;showy&#34; one).<br /><br />Make it like Cats or Miss Saigon, the helicopter can crash into Vahalla at the end. Cool.
B00A757EFW|1.0|worst game ever. timed. 5 minutes. I hate it. it is possibly one of the worst games ive ever played... scratch that. it is the worst.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The torch is passed to Jack Jr.  All the twists and turns of the series.  It took awhile to adjust the changes in the characters, but a great read, takes the series further along the new path. Waiting for the next one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have angry birds on every device I own and I love to play it although I'm not really that great at the game although I still love to play it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I downloaded this game thinking that my 3 year old would just tinker with it for a couple of hours. Oh how I was wrong. HE LOVES IT! I wish that I had my video camera out. He was squealing, literally squealing, while playing. He fell off the couch at one point because he was laughing so much. It's enjoyable mindless fun.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|They compare it to anger birds although it really is nothing like angry birds although it does have it own unique version to the game where your building vehicles instead.
B000059XUT|5.0|Toy Story is an all time classic.No doubt about it.The film was really ahead of it's time and gave us something very unique.It was a film that kids and adults both could enjoy.The sequels were decent,but this film by far,surpasses both the second and third in the series.Every movie lover should have this in their collection.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|May as well have been another remake of &#34;Bring it on&#34;.  Same basic, predictable plot progression and most of the best funny moments were included in the trailers.<br /><br />Not the worst movie I've seen recently, but far from the best.
B001HN6922|1.0|Cars 2 is a terrible movie.The story is very dull,and as mentioned in another review,it is way too violent for children.I would highly recommend passing this up and just picking up the first film.Hopefully Cars 3 will be a whole better than this.
B005DOL0R0|1.0|i dose not fit my kindle fire have to force zipper closed i think you sent wrong one i ordered kindle fire is says kindle fire but wrong size
B000001EHS|5.0|\\"Vault\\" gathers most of Def Leppard's big hits on one CD.Such as \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\"(the edited version),\\"Photograph\\",\\"Rock Of Ages\\",\\"Animal\\",the previously unreleased ballad,\\"When Love & Hate Collide\\" and many more.The only little problems that I have with this collection is,I think the \\"Hysteria\\" version of \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" should have been included on here with the cool intro...\\"step inside,walk this way,you and me babe,hey,hey!\\",instead of the edited version,that cuts the intro.\\"Rocket\\" has also been edited on here as well.I also think there should have been a couple more tunes from \\"High N Dry\\" included on here too.\\"On Through The Night\\",their first album wasn't really a huge hit,so I can understand why there wasn't any songs from there on here.Overall,this collection is great for casual fans,but for diehard fans of Def Leppard,I recommend picking up \\"Rock Of Ages:The Definitive Collection\\" instead...which is a two CD set that includes all of these songs found on \\"Vault\\",and a whole lot more.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|ok so I was at my friends house today and he showed me this app. I tried people like Lionel richie, meryl streep,  uncle jessie from full house,  Elvis,  and even pewdiepie! when I tried pewdiepie it guessed after 5 questions! great game that left me and my friends literally speachless. GETITGETITGETIT!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Excellent book. very thought provoking. Bit slow to start, but once you get into it, its definitly worth finishing. Can't wait to see the film version.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Fun game if you make it slow and don't stress over the fact you can only play a few short minutes until you run out of energy. I will not spend my cash on expansions or helps for the game so I progress much more slowly then others. I have zero desire to bother others with requests or connect via my social media contacts so I am again &quot; hindered&quot; by that. Reguardless of those issues the game concept is fun
B003L77G6A|5.0|All that my daughter expected and more. She was surprised as these DVDs were here Santa gift. I was a very happy mom at her reaction.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|A great spin on time travel. They did stuff I haven't seen before that really blew me away. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did very well adopting young Bruce Willis' mannerisms and facial expressions.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book was incredibly inspiring and a lovely novel and is highly recommended. This book was also really easy to read
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Wow, this book was good. Like a fiction account but real. It is not very Lon  but the words that fill it will make you think twice.
B001VNB54A|5.0|This is an awsome series to watch,great acting and especially interesting to hear the 1st hand accounts from the soldiers/survivors who experienced this harrowing time.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Great movie!  Clint Eastwood is one of the few left in Hollywood who believes in movies with a good ending!!  Great acting too!!
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Watch this movie periodically.  Helen Mirren is great!  She is one of my favorites.  Will continue to watch it periodically.
0007447868|4.0|I think people just don't understand that this is to be an EPIC series of 7 books, which is why there seems to be so much criticism of A Feast for Crow and A Dance with Dragons.  People felt betrayed when the plots moved away from the Starks, and became more in depth.  If there was to be no story about Dorne, why keep it on the map?  Yes, I think you need patience to continue with the series after Book 3, but in reality, the entire series ties together.  The so called \\"characters you have never heard of\\" are all mentioned previously from the point of view chapters of Tyrion and the others that are omitted in this book.  The Prince of Dorne for instance, Victarion as well.  They are subtle, but they are mentioned in the previous books.  Martin weaves them into the story and gives us the point of view of Cersei in a Feast for Crows, which was done well, continues with Jamie and brings in more interesting characters.  They all are parts of a long and epic story, which I think some readers just were not prepared for.  They fell in love with the Starks as the main characters of the narrative, without realizing Martin is writing about an entire WORLD and what is happening within it.  They also fail to realize that in order for him to give us a glimpse of this entire world, it is necessary to have changes of plot and of narrative to weave it all together.  A Feast for Crows really is the introduction to the world after the height of the Wars, and what will happen to the characters after.  I agree that it may not be as exciting as the first book or third book, but it is well done in what is it trying to accomplish, which is moving us forward to books 5-7.  I think readers need to take in the big picture of what is happening in Westeros before they read this.  If you have had enough of the series by book 3, then stop there and you won't be disappointed.  But as a whole, this book was interesting and served its purpose within the context of the entire story.  Which happens tobe very long, interwoven and full of twists and turns.  You can't have a 7 book series without having a few chapters that may not be as exciting as the others.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|too many commercials  for other products<br />  but love angry birds have on phone and tablet<br /><br />thanks for a great product
B005MMYBXI|5.0|If you haven't seen this show I highly recommend it !! I watched the 1st cpl. episodes last year and fell in love with this series right away. Gods of the arena is a pre-quel to Blood and sand, so I would suggest you watch it first, than blood and sand, and  than Spartacus Vengence. War of the Damned is the final season of Spartacus  premiering on Jan. 25th on Starz Channel.
1451627289|4.0|Although I am not a reader of horror novels and haven't read many of Stephen King's earlier books, I am a historian by profession and consequently I found this book to be a \\"can't put it down\\" time travel story. The main character goes back to 1963 to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from killing John Kennedy. Along the way, he has all kinds of adventures and even falls in love. I was in Dallas in 1963 and King's recreation of the place and the atmosphere of the times brought back a flood of memories.<br /><br />The book also contains a lot of time travel ideas about \\"strings of time\\" and how if you go back and change anything it can adversely impact the future, which is always a fun thing to think about. Overall, I found this book to be an enjoyable, informative and thought provoking reading experience.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|a very heartfelt, touching book. found myself tearing up at certain parts. recommend it to fans of Ellen Hopkins. (y)
B005LAII8K|1.0|This movie could have been something smart and interesting. Instead, it was nothing but gratuitous violence. It's shameful that this is considered entertainment. I'm sorry that I subjected myself (and my family) to it. Just say \\"no!\\"
0345803507|5.0|I absolutely loved all three books.  There was an actual story line in them, not filth as some prudes thought.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|a well researched Arthurian novel with its emphasis on the socio-politico-spiritual status of women in the British Isles at the onset of the Dark Ages, especially with respect to the complete and abject dominance of the male culture over women's lives, which effectively denied a woman's basic human rights for the twenty centuries following the establishment Roman rule in Europe......
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It is a very fun game, but aggravating sometimes.  You just gotta keep going.  LOL&#62;&#62;  Had to know what all the fuss was about.
0143121006|5.0|Reading historic true crime often requires a willingness to wade through some boring exposition to reach the interesting facts of the case.  \\"Midnight in Peking\\" is fairly unique in that there are no boring parts to wade through.  The story is compelling from start to finish.<br />Half the secret to good historic true crime writing probably lies in picking the right case to profile.  Paul French has chosen a great story for \\"Midnight in Peking.\\"  First, the story takes place in an exotic locale.  The setting is exotic in both time and space.  Peking in 1937 was a fascinating place, caught in the turbulence created by the collapse of an ancient culture, the decadence of the occupying Europeans, and the impending threat of the invading Japanese.  French does a great job describing this socio-political disaster which set the scene for the murder.<br />Second, the murder itself was a particularly appalling crime:  a young British girl was mutilated and killed and left near the Fox Gate, a place the Chinese viewed as haunted.  Her story comes in layers, which peel away to reveal her secret life.<br />Third, we have a persistent man seeking the truth about the murder.  Often, in such stories, the persistence comes from a detective who just won't give up.  But in this case, the man seeking the truth was the victim's father, an eccentric and aging professor who bombarded an indifferent British consulate with a massive amount of evidence about the murder, obtained from shady and dangerous characters.  This evidence, assembled with obsessive care, allowed the author seventy years later to advance a fascinating theory about the true perpetrators of the crime, and their horrifying motives and deeds.<br />I highly recommend \\"Midnight in Peking.\\"  It is one of the best historic true crime accounts I have ever read.
0374214913|5.0|Last week I got an email from my favorite local radio station announcing they were starting a new book club - On a whim, I joined and bought the book on Amazon.  It arrived this past Saturday, and frankly all I had hoped to do was skim it before our club's inaugural meeting/wine tasting on Tuesday.  I sat down in my favorite chair Sunday afternoon and completely lost myself in the story. I didn't even bother to fix dinner that night.  The book went with me to bed and was finished there this morning, in lieu of my normal 5:00AM visit to the gym.  Christopher Moore is one of my favorite authors, and I especially love his four vampire and related books set in SF.  I could have been easily fooled into thinking this was book five in that series, completely different characters of course, but stylistically very similar, with so many of the same great elements to delight readers on every page.  I can't wait to see more from Mr. Sloan.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool was one of those fantastic discoveries that Amazon's 'people who read this, also read...' links have led me to.<br /><br />I had never heard of Wool, or Howey but a quick peek at his writing style before buying convinced me he had talent as a writer and an interesting premise.<br /><br />I devoured the book in a couple of days and loved every chapter.<br /><br />His writing style is sparse, but he gives his characters great depth and you very quickly begin to emphathise with each of them. He transitions focus from one character to another very smoothly without losing the reader along the way and this technique helps keep the narrative dynamic.<br /><br />If I have a critique, it would only be that having created a post-apocalyptic world and a story of man's survival within it, he felt a compulsion to explain how the world had come to be that way... Personally, I didn't need that explanation and it devalued the story for me. I was happy to accept the reality of the post-apocalyptic world he had created, without the need to understand how it had come about. Climate change, nuclear holocaust, meteorite strike...I considered all of these. I also considered whether the world he was describing was even on Eath - it could as easily have been Mars. But his explanation, when it came, was to me trite, unlikely and unsatisfying, and I am sure he would have disappointed as many readers and he satisfied. So in a nutshell, Howey does explain how armageddon wiped out most of the good people of earth, and you may actually wish he didn't.<br /><br />Otherwise, a fabulous read highly recommended.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|In this book about a purported near-death-experience I was left with a lingering question. Can his experience even be called a near-death experience? Usually, people who write or report about NDEs have had a cardiac arrest (clinical death) or loss of blood, electrocution, coma resulting from traumatic brain injury - the author had none of these as far as I could understand.<br /><br />The very involved and repeated explanations of why inflammation of the brain, which the author suffered, could be equated to something as traumatic as heart failure or physical brain injury were not convincing to me. He explains that the inflammation shut down the thought and emotional centers of his brain while he was in a coma, ie the areas we believe are responsible for dreaming, and that may be true. But as far as I could read, at no point did his brain activity 'flat line' - he was not at any point declared 'brain dead'.<br /><br />So his brain was still alive and active, and the experiences he describes remembering while in the coma could easily have been the product of that activity. That is, they could have been simple dreams. Vivid dreams, but dreams nonetheless.<br /><br />Dr Alexander would argue that based on our current understanding of the brain, and the centers which control dreaming, that is not possible, but one could counter that our current understanding of how the brain functions is very primitive. It has been shown that when areas of the brain usually responsible for a function are damaged, other areas of the brain can take over, and who is to say the ability to dream is not exactly like this?<br /><br />At points the book is intriguing, as Alexander describes his memories of this spiritual world and being able to move between three different levels of consciousness within this world, at first with a spiritual guide, later at will.<br /><br />But he lost me when he tried to describe what he saw...for example, the beings he equated with 'angels' which he described as glowing spheres with long tails, floating high above him, singing. If that is the afterlife, it just sounds...silly.<br /><br />At the end though, I respect the central theme of his message. It comes down to one word - love.<br /><br />The message Alexander wants the world to understand is the same as the one Jesus, Mohammed, and Buddha shared.<br /><br />All you need is love, and love is all you need.<br /><br />Whether or not you believe Alexander's experience was Proof of Heaven, it is always nice to be reminded of this central thought.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|The Power of Habits was one of the most fascinating books I've read. It is life changing. I have applied the simple formula for changing habits and have taken back control of my life. I have always believed that knowledge is the power, we have to change our circumstances, and this amazing book gave me the power I needed to make the changes I've struggled with all my life. Thanks for the insight.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I can't handle suspense and never had much interest in the military. This book has been an eye opening read and I'm so happy I had the opportunity to read it. It has changed my views about what American soldiers are all about. I highly recommend this book.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I was playing this game and I found it so incredibly fun. But then all the sudden you have to pay three bucks for the game, when I thought you got the whole this for free. I bought it because it was awesome, but I wish they could've added something like &quot;just a demo&quot;
B009KKLQKO|4.0|This is a great concert video for anyone that likes the Beach Boys. There's nothing better than old guys still making music!<br />They look like they're having a great time - which for me - makes the concert. Glad I didn't listen to the few that gave bad reviews. A great addition to my concert DVD library.
B008476HBM|5.0|I had always wanted to read this especially after seeing the movie. I love to see how the screenwriters either kept to the story or alters it in some ways.
B008XMXFS6|5.0|I highly recommend this album. You will not be disappointed! It's not as funky like their first album, but it's full of good songs.

B008CP6RWU|5.0|This review is strictly for the game \\"Journey\\".<br /><br />I first started to play this game last week and I paused as I past the first chapter. It didnt seem like anything special as you just move around and jump and make sounds. Afterwards my brother completed the game. He told me I had to play it.<br /><br />So I went back and I play it just because the visuals were really nice. I still havent find the game to be anything impressive although is fun until I met a person in a white cloak (my companion throughout the whole game from chapter 2 onwards) with a very long scarf. I had no idea who this is and why this person is in white since my brother said his partners were in the same brown cloak, but this person played along with me and he/she showed me ways to find the different symbols in the game. Throughout the whole game, I just followed my partner, he/she showing me where to go and we often make calls to each other when we are lost or separated. I felt a special bonding experience with someone I had no idea of who they are or what's their name. This special bonding makes this game much more enjoyable.<br /><br />I finished this game in more or less 1 or 2 hrs. I had wish this game would have been longer but either way it's still a beautiful game and the multiplayer experience works really well.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love love LOVE this game!:D it's really entertaining and even if you screw up... you just keep going XD  for example, I accidentally deleted the game, 're-download it, started from the beginning when I had gotten all the way to tiger shark, and its still a buttload uh fun!!!!

B0061S073A|1.0|I thought that this would be a great way to keep my kids from accidently ordering items from their games, however I was totally unable to exit the program. I took 15mins to exit the program/ resume my normal kindle screen!

B005LAIHSG|5.0|Snow White and the Huntsman is an entertaiing retelling of a classic tale.  The acting is good and the plot keeps your attention.
0307454568|3.0|When I read the first book, I was immediately captivated by its character and plot. The second book was gripping but didn't draw me in as much as the first, and the third one, in my opinion, just fell flat. I had to read it because I wanted to know how the story ended and what happened between Lisbeth and Blomkvist.<br /><br />For a large section of the story, the author focused on explaining the history behind the police department in Sweden and introducing many many other not too significant characters, which to be honest was pretty dry. There are also the little stalker incident with Berger and the romance between Blomkvist and another detective, which i thought didn't contribute that much to the overall storyline and was quite underdeveloped, like a little tag-along to the main story.<br /><br />I would have liked to see Lisbeth being involved in more of the story, but for the most part the author decided to focus on the investigation being carried out by the police department and Blomkvist. All in all, the ending was realistic and logical. I'm glad i found out about what happened, but instead of reading through the entire book, maybe i would have just read a much shorter summary and found out about the ending in a shorter way
B006DZYM0A|3.0|It was not my favorite movie, but it did arrive in good time.  The movie did not live up to the reviews or summaries.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|In the book Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins develops an adventurous journey that leads through a powerful, but difficult time to survive and win for their district. Collins creates an interesting feel because even though it is fight to the death, there are other aspects to the book. She invents romance, action, and real world issues that are occurred to this day. The book makes us think about life lessons that we normal teens might not think about from day-to-day. Would you kill someone if it was a choice between murder and your own death? How can people survive when all the odds are stacked against them? Suzanne explains this by creating a world of poverty and hunger; the parents of the young gladiators are so beaten down and afraid of the totalitarian regime that they just hug their kids and pray to have food on the table. Every time I eat, I always think about the children, especially Prim, whose begging and dying for food. I have developed a whole new respect for starving children, who are fortunate like me. The Hunger Games is the best book I have ever read through my ten years of reading.<br />The Hunger Games takes place in a nation known as Panem, established in North America after the destruction of the continent's civilization by an unknown apocalyptic event. The nation consists of the wealthy Capitol and twelve surrounding, poorer districts united under the Capitol's control. District 12, where the book begins, is located in the coal-rich region that was formerly known as Appalachia. As punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol, in which a 13th district was destroyed, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, an event in which the tributes must fight to the death in an outdoor arena controlled by the Capitol, until only one individual remains. The male tribute Peeta Mellark and the volunteer Katniss Everdeen begin their journey together, while they say goodbye to their families for possibly the last time. Together they use each other, their knowledge, their resources, and other tributes to kill the dangers of Katniss and Peeta to their advantage.<br />The character Cinna, reminds me of the show Project Runway. He uses the same fashion techniques as the show Project Runway. Cinna creates that impressive visual aspect of creative clothing and make-up techniques. Cinna also reminds me of Tyra Banks. They both know high fashion and know have to make others look amazingly beautiful. On the other hand the overall book reminds me of the series Twilight. They both endure violence and romance of one other. Peeta and Gale have a thing for Katniss, while Bella and Edward have romantic relationship.<br />Epiphany is a character's sudden realization of a truth in a work of literature. This novel has many important epiphanies that change the course of the plot. The most vital epiphany for Katniss came was when Rue died and she suddenly understood what Peeta meant about being \\"more than just a piece in their Games\\" (Collins 236). This is when she truly decides to fight against the Capitol. I think this revelation is what will drive her throughout the series.  Another example of epiphany is when Katniss discovers that she and Peeta have a similar goal, so they are truly connected. They work as a team and care for each other when they are hurt or trying to kill the other tributes.<br />Another major literary element in The Hunger Games is symbolism. The mocking jay pin is the circular gold token Katniss wears during the Games to represent District 12. Each tribute is allowed one item to remind them of their friends and family in their home district; the small pin bearing the image of a bird in flight is Katniss's. The mocking jay pin was originally given to Katniss by the mayor's daughter, before Katniss's departure to the Capitol to participate in the Hunger Games. Though Katniss forgets about the pin during her training sessions, Cinna is sure to place the mocking jay prominently on Katniss's outfit for the arena. He tells her that the little pin \\"barely cleared the review board\\" since the authorities thought Katniss might be able to use the pin as a weapon (Collins 78). While the thought of a tiny little pin being used as a weapon might seem silly to us, but as we will find out, it is indeed an incredibly powerful and important weapon.<br />In general the novel is written for any gender and it a young adult series. The book stars a boy and a girl and involves hunting, deaths, romance, fighting, and life lessons. I would say the age range should be 11 and up. I feel at the age of 11, they can comprehend a level like this book, and take the full meaning of The Hunger Games to full heart. Also younger people under 11 shouldn't read the book because it may be inappropriate for them. The violence and romance can be too much for them to read and deal with. I would highly recommend using this age limit and you will see why it can be inappropriate and too graphic for the child's mind.<br />I had heard this was a great book so I bought it with high expectations. It's so interesting that a book targeted for young adults has all teenagers as main characters. I'm usually not a big fan of fantasy novel, but this one I couldn't put down. The violence was strong for a young-adult book and I thought it was great nonetheless. I understand the setting is in a semi-post apocalypse, but does the author really believe human nature to be that bad? It put me into perspective for quite a while. Overall the book was breathtaking and inspiring to me. I 100% recommend the novel, The Hunger Games!!!<br />By: Ashley Colaizzi
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Genius! Nothing more needs to be said. It was an amazing book, amazing writing, and amazing characters. Although the book ends I'm hoping that Colleen will continue Sky and Holder's story.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|My son loves this movie !!  He has all of the MIB movies now . . . they never get old
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Having just completed this, I have now read all of Brandon Sanderson's works to date.  All of them have been wonderful, but I especially loved \\"Elantris\\", so when I heard about a new book being released based the same world,I got excited.  And I was definitely not disappointed!  \\"The Emperor's Soul\\"has Sanderson's customary strong female character as a lead,a new but fascinating magic system that I would love to read more about, an intriguing premise, and just a darn good story told in a darn good way, just like every other Sanderson book.  Even for a short book, it includes a lot of good details and intricacies that make a story interesting, like the specifics of the seals or the subtleties to Ashrovan (the Emperor in question).  Definitely a great book and a quick read.  I only wish it was longer!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is so fun !!  Who doesn't love the minnions??  Cute as ever.  We are looking forward to the next movie !!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The series is very addicting and a must see for every American. The acting is excellent and the story line intriguing.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Came on time to give to my grand daughter for Christmas.  She watched it that day. She love it!  ;-)
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble has that easy listening to voice and it sounded lovely with Christmas songs.  It'a a hit for next year too.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It's fun! U get to have ur own zoo and the animals come from all over the world. It's really cool and I have fun. The nursery stuff is quick too!
0375805621|5.0|Got this for my grand-son along with his very own copy of &#34;The Monster at the End of This Book&#34;. (We'd been reading my copy.) It made my Christmas watching him read this along with his daddy and the two of them doing the voices together after the first time! Also, if your child is fearful of unknown &#34;monsters&#34;, these may be re-assuring that not all fears turn out to be that scary when you face them. They are both a fairly quick read, but be prepared to ham it up and repeat often!
B004J64QSI|5.0|Closest thing I've got to seeing a live production. The cast is great. Samantha Barks is particularly enjoyable as Eponine.
0307010856|5.0|I've bought many copies of this book over the years. It makes a great gift for a new big sister or brother who will enjoy the humor & time that baby can't. And the kids all love when I do voices and act frightened when they turn the pages. Best of all, I'm reading it to my 2 1/2 year old grand-son now and he likes imitating the lines after me. So much fun!
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie was funnier than I thought it was going to be!  So happy I pre-ordered it!  I also got a discount because it was cheaper after pre-order, so Amazon refunded me some of my money!!
B005EVVESM|5.0|Great band, great CD, I cannot stop listening to it. It's the best album of 2012 in my opinion. Totally recommended.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie. It is very old-fashioned in the way it is presented and very inspirational. Would highly recommend it for everyone.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I gave Mile 81 a 5 star review because it sucks you into the story right from the  beginning - just like a certain station wagon does in the story. Inventive and creepy.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is so much fun. I love that they incorporated the Star Wars theme in every game. Very Genius!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was absolutely amazing. The surprising ending caught me off guard and was definitely a twist for usual Rick Riordan books. I loved it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is easy to do and has great graphics. If you have a good finger then off you go.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|What a thriller!!!  The suspense carries you on the edge of your seat until the end!  Great sequel to the series.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|take wait for part 6 to come out it's has to be a reboot with new characters and new monsters
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've always enjoyed reading Stephen King's books, and this one is no exception.  I finished it a month ago, and I'm still thinking about it.  Some of the events may seem familiar to some of his other works, but the character relationships in this book was the best he's ever done.  I was so sad to finish it because I loved them all.  I just can't imagine anyone not loving this book.  Before I read it, my Dad told me this was his best so far.  I was a little doubtful about that, but as usual, Dad was right.  I hope  you enjoy this as much as I (we) did.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Fantastic book that leaves you feeling a lot of different emotions. Parts of the story I saw coming and parts left me amazed where it went.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|ezPDF Reader is the other main pdf reader for Android, but Repligo is much better looking as an app.  It does text to speech, and can \\"reflow\\" the text for easy reading.  The interface isn't too cluttered; the app gets out of the way, so you can work.  The annotations show up well and are easily extracted/exported on a computer by Adobe Reader or some other pdf program.  Highly recommended if you spend a lot of time reading journal articles!
B005DOKIYG|5.0|I gave it as a gift with the Kindle fire, she said she likes it. She likes the color. Nice.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is so creative and fun.  I don't like many games; they're either too easy or too hard/twitchy, but I love this one.  The game mechanism of drawing items to interact with the world is great.  I like how there is more than one way to solve the puzzles.  Not everyone thinks in the same way, and the game designers took that into account!  There are ways to get through that require fast reflexes, but also ways where thinking out of the box helps.  Plus, there are cute bunnies.  And zombies.  Great for all ages.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Having read three other books by this author, I found this one almost mesmerizing. It was so interesting to learn facts about the rise of Nazism that I had not been aware of before. Have also read Fall of Giants. Love reading historical novels.
B001K3ENEA|4.0|Made in China, I bought these knowing AKG makes good headphones to try them out.<br /><br />These are an excellent set of headphones, and for anyone looking to get excellent vocal headphones, these are it!<br /><br />These are somewhat comparable to Sony MDR-V6/7506 when it comes to vocals and mid frequencies, however they do not provide the same noise isolation as the Sony and average bass.<br /><br />Plugging these straight into an iPod and you will only get decent volume output, these are better off plugged into a headphone amplifier.  The volume isn't overpowering on an iPod however.  I'm using the built-in amp on my Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 and there is a night and day difference.<br /><br />Music is excellent, movies are excellent.  These really make dialogue pop in movies.<br /><br />Comfort wise, they are average.  They don't provide a manual adjustment but rather an elastic headband that fits to your head.  It works just fine but the headphones fit a bit loose.<br /><br />The headphone cable is not detachable, very decent and thickness.  I actually prefer a straight cable vs coiled ones used on Sonys.<br /><br />For the price I've seen these ($30-40) you really can't go wrong.  The AKG K-240 are currently only $61 and sound much better for the price. If you can afford the $70 get the V6s and you will get superior sound, comfort/fit, bass.  But the sound on these are very impressive.<br /><br />And of course, I rather use these over over priced Dre Beats any day of the week.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good book.... onto the 3rd one...... can't wait to start mocking Jay!! Once u start reading u can't stop!!
B00006YXJ5|5.0|Harrison will always be my favourite Beatle, so it was rather sad when this came out knowing this was his \\"Swan Song.\\"<br /><br />Excellent album overall, \\"Between The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" is a unique piece as you can almost tell George knew his time was coming to an end, it has a double meaning as far as his career and life is met by the evil and good of this world.<br /><br />Be that good in this world.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book great ending for wonderful series..... i would recommend this book for others to read...love love it!!

B00984668E|5.0|after rockin warp riders for so long & its catchy hooks and heavy pace, I thought that apocryphon was kind of boreing. At first. It took a couple of listens to let the album sink in becouse I have always been a fan of fast tempos, and I had been listening to warp riders so much, I expected faster. once I let the groove of the album hit me though&#60; It has been pure aural plaesure.

B00AA7O22U|3.0|Well, what can you say!  Some good scenes here and there, and the guys try hard to act and say a few jokes.<br />Kind of dumb plot.  Overall, entertaining!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is easily the best novel that I have read this year.  I fell in love with the characters and enjoyed the fast pace storyline.  I was surprised that I even choose to read this book.  Not at all my style, but I was happy that I did.  Beautifully written and grips you right from the first chapter.  Excellent debut novel.  I wish there was one more chapter closing out the story.  With that said...I really loved this book!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|We absolutely love this show. My children and my husband and I watch it together. The kids usually watch every episode multiple times.
0142420891|5.0|Not what I was expecting at all!<br /><br />Better than the 1st...and quite moving.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book! The 1st book was so good and I wasn't sure how good the second could be after Mia woke up. I felt her pain and the turmoil in her choice. I was thinking she had her \\"her happy ever after\\"....right? She woke up...she chose Adam. I mean how could she really have a \\"happy ever after\\" after loosing her family? That is why this book was so believable. I ached for Adam's emptiness and loved the depth of the love he struggles through. I enjoyed the book and wished I had read it sooner.

B007P6VLRS|1.0|Qusar was cool and a strong opening to the album but after that every other songs sucks and sounds exactally the same like one big long drawn out crappy song.  Not impressed with this at all.  Try it, after the opening track you will sware track 2-onward is stuck on repeat of the same song.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The motion picture soundtrack for Les Miserables is a beautiful collection of the top songs. I would have given it a 4 star rating because it left out songs such as &#34;Do You Hear the People Sing?&#34; and &#34;A Little Fall of Rain&#34;, but I purchased it at the deal price of $4.99 making it 5 star worthy. I'm not sure I would have purchased it at full price.
B0037DGH4A|5.0|Title says it all.<br />When Supernatural first released on CD, it was the first I'd bought in about a decade.<br />There's not a single bad track on the whole album.<br />My favorites are Put Your Lights On and Smooth.  Maria Maria is great as well, but suffers from some overplay.<br />Not sure what the remaster gains as the CD was LSL (loaned, stolen or lost) a long time ago, but the quality of the downloaded version is top notch.<br />This is one album I'd buy for twice the price.
1451695195|5.0|A must read. Not only if you have lost a loved one (I lost a son and a brother), but for your own peace of mind. I was NOT a believer, but I sure am now. Reading Proof of Heaven changed my life over night. I will be forever grateful to Dr. Eben Alexander.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I started reading Patricia Cornwell in the early 1990s after I heard an amazing review for her first novel on NPR. It was a love affair for a while -- couldn't get them quickly enough! However, they got kind of weird, muddled and poorly writen and for the past five or six years, every time I read a new one, I vow to myself that it would be my last. But, alas, I can't keep away and as soon as one is released, I'm there. I was somewhat pleased a novel or two ago when she changed the voice to first person: It really helped and the writing was much better. However, the plots have become ridiculous and the characters just beyond hackneyed.<br /><br />As usual, i Bone Bed, some unknown bad guy is stalking Scarpetta and she apparently occupies the center of the universe. (How many times have we seen that?) She's betrayed by everyone around her and everyone around her keeps secrets. For Benton's character, we could insert a paper cut-out doll and get a more humanized character. (Does he do anything besides have furtive discussions on the phone with the FBI?) And probably the most annoying character continues to be Lucy for reasons which aren't even worth outlining here. Bottom line: the marquee characters have become so jaded that Bone Bed is almost a parody of them. The plot is a bit intruiguing, but degenerates pretty quickly into nonsense. There's none of the good old forensic analysis that got me hooked on Cornwell in the first place. And, finally, there are some plot points that are just ridiculous. (And believe me, I'm perfectly capable of willing suspension of disbelief: Angent Pendergast novels are my current fave and they are barely grounded in reality, but at least have some internal believability.) For example, in Bone Bed, there are a couple of scenese where Scarpetta is insanely obsessed with making sure that evidence isn't compromised and insists that she literally jumps off the boat into the ocean to reel in a body to ensure that. Ok, fine. She's meticulous about appearances and doesn't want conflict of interest. Yet, she employs Lucy -- without pay -- at the ME's office where Lucy (with her highly checkered past) has access to lots of evidence and confidential info. We just can't have it both ways. Probably sounds like a nit, but if you're a long-time (and increasingly disappointed) Scarpetta fan, you probably know what I mean.<br /><br />I wish the Scarpetta novels could be about forensics and interesting cases that don't involved some paranoid grand master scheme at which Scarpetta isn't at the center. If that's what you also are looking for, skip Bone Bed. You'll be disappointed, for sure.
