B008UCJ7KO|2.0|What a waste of my money & time. Call me naive, but I really thought this book would be the end. Book 4 and 5? Come on, drop the bone and go start another book with new characters. I'm done with this.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I would say everybody should get because I mean you get to be nemo who doesn't want to be nemo right because nemo is awesome
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it keeps u guessing and intrigued. definitely addicted to it ow thank you for a great game
B008G12ERC|4.0|This is a good album from Muse... It is also a different sound than their earlier material. There are many polar opinions about this album and they usually go something like:<br /><br />I love it, great new sound.<br />I hate it, doesn't sound like the Muse I know.<br /><br />Generally people who were expecting a specific sound from Muse found themselves disappointed because this album is somewhat of a departure from their original sound. If this is you, then you may struggle as well.<br /><br />If you are the type to see what curious new creation Muse has made in this album and are more open to a different sound than what they've done in the past, then you are going to be more likely to enjoy this one.<br /><br />When I first listened to 2nd Law I found myself really getting into about 1/3 of the tracks straight away. After a little more listening I found that several more grew on me quite a bit as wel.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works really well compared to my inconsistent cell phone alarm, although a vibration would work better than a tune for me I guess it's all the same if I get up on time anyways
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|It's like they pulled this album from the archives.  Pop it in, and go back to the Black Sabbath / Paranoid days.  Been listening to this every day since is was released.  Medium and slower-tempo songs with great rifs and lyrics.  Outstanding drumming.  Not a bad track on here.  I like Beginning Of The End and Damaged Soul the best.  If you like the original Sabbath material, I don't see how you would not really enjoy this album.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Thought that the story was all over and realised I was only halfway through the book. There were so many unexpected twists and turns that I couldn't stop reading it.
B001223BLU|5.0|I can't believe I spent 20 years without Frankie Valli and his Seasons, but this compilation reminded me of the best musical years of my life listening to the best vocal group in the world. Yes, that includes the Moptops, Beach Dudes, and The Beagles (Eagles?). Thanks for the memories!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Enjoyed this book. A great read over the holidays. Good character development and enough twists in the plot to keep me interested.
1878424319|5.0|I'm excited, for I will get to meet the author in a couple of weeks.<br />This will and could change some people's lives who have not had any spiritual experiences.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Love this game of Iron Man 3! Download it, Play it, Share it, Rate it, Comment it, Be it! That's all I have to say people
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's like simcity but a little different.But I need more money to get stuff. But I still like it is a very good game.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Enjoyed the game at the start, enough to invest in purchasing gold stars to be competitive. Started receiving connection with server issues. Then received update available. Completed update, system crashed and I lost the game,  it had reloaded at level 1. Tried to install from the cloud and still level 1 game. Goodbye level 18 and about $150. What a shame or a scam.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|Super excited to watch this movie with my daughters and sisters! They are in ballet so I think they will love it! Movie night! Thanks!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is about horses and I mean who doesn't like horses not me I love horses yay yay  yay
B00BPJ5Z96|4.0|Bruce Lee will always be the best, but this blu ray release doesnt have any extra video footage that we havent seen before in other releases.  However there are a few goodies that come in the package like an &#34;iron on&#34; patch, lobby cards, a booklet with behind the scenes shots,and a really cool 3-D moveable image of Bruce doing his nun chucks. If you already have a prior blu-ray release and just looking for video footage extras, dont bother. You wont find them here. If you havent seen the video extras before (I suspect most Bruce Lee fans have) then you'll want this. If you're interested in the care package goodies (booklet,patch,lobby cards and 3-D image) then you'll definitely want this.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is a must for any and every Marvel fan (movie or comic book).  I enjoy having the blueray and DVD combo as i'm able to watch on different devices and lend to friends while still keeping one at home.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Just downloaded Diamond Dash, have spent way to much time playing already! Fast moving and easy to play<br />Try it!
0307943232|4.0|This was not one of his best, but then, taste is subjective. However, Grisham never disappoints, as it was still very entertaining and kept you guessing. Anyone who likes mystery will love this book.
0770437400|5.0|World War \\"Z\\" is one of the best \\"Apocalypse\\" novels I have read - The interview format gives the book a sense of realism - Each interview being a short story in it's own right and this novel is well written.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I rrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeellllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyy l<br />lllllllllllllllooooooooooooovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeeee iiiiiiiiiiiiiiitttttttttttttttt............ and would be awesome if you would add horses and take out the boards and have a western background.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Great book, so well written. Enjoyable for all all age groups. This is a thought provoking read. Looking forward to the next one.
0345803493|5.0|I could NOT put it down, I literally couldn't wait to see what else was reveled about Fifty!!!!  I so enjoyed ALL of it and the deep love he had for her and the changes that he went through, for LOVE was wonderful.  But I have to say Ana got on my nerves and I wanted to shake her and say HE LOVES YOU!!!  I couldn't wait to get to the third book.  WOW!!
030758836X|5.0|Tightly plotted with fascinating, fully-realized (though not necessarily sympathetic) characters.<br /><br />And talk about suspense! I'm the early-to-bed, early-to-rise type and this had me up until 2am.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Good book. Lots of twists and turns. Easy to read. Keeps your attention trying to figure out who was the good and bad in this book.
076115678X|5.0|My daughter is 11, a low maintenance girl in a high maintenance body. Deva Curl products are a blessing, helping her keep her curls under control and beautiful. Now her hair is wash and wear!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This app is adictively fun in so many ways and I would recommend it to anybody who likes games where u create a base,training soldiers, making a strong army overall this app is good but it always have trouble downloading the updates and currently I keep trying to download the latest update but it just takes me to the app store and I too to the app and it opens and just asks if you want to download the latest update and I touch ok and it takes me to the app store again and the same things happen as before and I've been tyring to get the latest update for the past 2days and the same thing happens and I could use some help but just because I have this problem that shouldn't stop you from downloading this app.
1582406723|5.0|My husband is a huge fan of the series and was not happy about waiting for the new season. He is not a huge reader but tore through the graphic novels. Now he is not only waiting for the tv series but the next graphic novel!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is worth every penny is spent and yes I definitely enjoyed this app  because of the challenges, addictive endless survivals and all of the amazing upgradable tower which destroy balloons in fantastic ways and I would recommend it to anyone. Ninja kiwi did an amazing job on this app and who cares that this app cost 3dollars it's worth a lot more and is a lot better than most of the apps being released today. TRUST ME.. u won't regret getting this app.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|My husband is a huge fan of the series and was not happy about waiting for the new season. He is not a huge reader but tore through the graphic novels. Now he is not only waiting for the tv series but the next graphic novel!
B0026QC0YU|4.0|enjoyed how it tried to staly loyal to the TV show.  The ending was fun to watch and somewhat surprising.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really love the game but my work on a world rarely shows up. When it does - its a game of skill.
0802130208|3.0|After hearing about this book for years, I finally picked up a copy while on vacation in New Hampshire. One of the staff members at a local indie bookstore had labeled it her favorite book of all time. It seems to inspire that kind of passionate reaction. I wish I knew why.<br /><br />I've gotten through about three-quarters of the book, but in frustration I consulted the Wikipedia entry on Toole, and the reader reviews on Amazon, to get a better picture about this book's history and reception. That helped somewhat.<br /><br />Yes, this is a comic novel, and it's full of colorful, eccentric characters, none more so than the protagonist, Ignatius Reilly. But there is also a deep vein of sadness that runs through these pages. All these people, Reilly especially, seem pathetic. Either their delusions and psychological rigidity are so complete that they will never escape the fate that Toole designed for them, or else they are one-dimensional enough that they seem to be present mostly to advance the plot or provide one more comic stereotype.<br /><br />It is interesting to read (in Wikipedia, so it must be true!) that Toole brought his manuscript to Robert Gottlieb, who was at Simon and Schuster at the time and was shepherding works like Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" into print. Gottlieb recognized the manuscript's potential, but he urged revisions upon Toole because he could not detect a compelling central theme in the work. Toole was unable or unwilling to revise to Gottlieb's satisfaction, so Simon and Schuster ultimately passed on \\"Confederacy.\\" As did, presumably, the rest of the New York publishing establishment.<br /><br />This back story makes sense to me. There is a moral dimension to \\"Catch-22,\\" for example, that is largely absent from \\"Confederacy.\\" Heller, like Mark Twain before him, showed that a work of fiction could be outrageously funny and at the same time point up the most significant flaws and tensions in American culture. The social commentary not only rings true, it brings another, necessary layer of humanity to the characters and situations. We care about them in large part because we see (and they often sense) how they are trapped in the gears of some really toxic social machinery.<br /><br />On the other hand, it's hard to invest in the fates of Reilly or the other inhabitants of \\"Confederacy.\\" It's more than a little too obvious that they are drawn up primarily to be comic or at least grotesque. The set pieces go on just a little too long -- a mistake that the writers of 17th-century picaresque novels never made. There's so much cruelty and self-loathing floating through the narrative that one finally puts the book down, feeling pity for its creator but not a shred of interest in the story or its people.<br /><br />Toole was praised for his ability to capture perfectly the patois of certain working-class folks in the New Orleans of the '50s and '60s. Undoubtedly if you know New Orleans well, that will help you turn the pages of \\"Confederacy.\\" For me, that became a chore.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Expectation not delivered. Hero was disappointing. So, many beautiful actress wasted. The story was good but the screen play is not good.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Lets face it.  Not all of the books in the Wheel of Time series are worthy of a 5 star rating.  At least one might even be a 1 star flop.  However, the majority of the books in the series are a solid read.  The last 3 were fantastic. In particular,  this last book was a true \\"page turner\\".  So much of the ground work laid out in the previous books comes to light in this book.  For instance, the finding of the Horn and Matt's \\"resurrection\\",  two distinct events in the series culminate in one crucial event in this final story.<br /><br />Bottom line, If you have read the series up to this point,  no question you should read this book.<br />If you have enjoyed the series to this point,  you will enjoy this book.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I go to flipboard first on my phone now when I sit down with time to kill.  Great content, with a good focus on what I'm looking for.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|This looked like it was going to be a fun updated version of the story, but this movie was incredibly predicable and the characters were too cliche. The CGI wasn't very good, the costumes were odd and distracting, like they were trying to make up for the poor dialog. Ewan McGregor couldn't carry the whole movie with his small part.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Difficult to watch in the beginning, but once this movie makes the turn, it is really good. Awesome casting and  acting. Both the main actors nail their parts and are so believable and my wife and I both loved the ending.
B0050DZN4K|1.0|As of today, this program no longer works on my Kindle Fire HD. You would have thought that with the extensive time before Google shut down DevHD would have tested things. Oh well, there are other apps. :(
B00003CXRM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it was so funny.  I can't stop watching this movie, I play it over and over.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a terrific book that I couldn't put down.  From the very first chapter to the last, I needed to find out how the novel would end.  Since I am a middle school teacher, I was compelled to find out what would happen.  What a surprising twist at the end. A must read novel.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really love this game.  However, I wish it had more directions.  It also bothers me that I have to buy extra things that appear at the top since I didn't know what they were when I clicked on them.  Can you tell I am NEW to this game and my Kindle.
0525953728|4.0|A wonderful up close (accurate) experience from the person (people) who actually were involved.  More details than we had been fed by the government.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Interested to see how the series goes. Can tell its his first novel. Enjoyed it well enough. Worth the read.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Her singing performance at the beginning makes me cry every time. Absolutely incredible.  A must see. Gerard wasn't bad either. Definitely worth the time.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Loved it.  Thank you Seal Team Six!  We are blessed to have men and woman like Mark who are willing to put their lives on the line everyday.  I merely wished the author was willing to share a little more about his home life, but I understand why he opted not to do so.  Great read.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked the way this was written in first person. Kept me interested the whole time. Good airplane reading. If you have seen the movie, this book has a lot of plot differences, and not such a happy ending. I recommend reading the book first, then checking out the movie. They are both good.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|John Williams songs that play during any of the chase scenes and the big action moments sound great on Blu-Ray and the picture is outstanding.  Really worth the price to buy an upgrade for any movie fan.  We had the 4 on regular DVD, while it was still nice to watch, having it on HD with the Blu-Ray technology and sound was that much better.  I was able to buy this on a gold box special for less than half the price and it was so worth it.  Keep your' eye out for it to be on sale again, and don't hesitate to jump on it and snatch up a copy for yourself.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The ending left you completely hanging which I didn't like.  I waited for months for this book to come out and now I don't know if there will be another one to the series or when it will come out.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I love this movie, and with the Blu-Ray picture and sound technology, its makes the viewing even more special.  Crystal clear pictures, really adds great depth to all the scenes and with the soundtrack to the movie, with the drums just sound much more alive.  Really a great experience watching it like this.  I was able to purchase this while it was on sale on here, so for about $10, you cannot beat that deal.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very cool game I just love it.  It keeps my cousins real busy. This is a lot of fun I recommend this game to kids and adults!!!!!
B004SUDQE0|2.0|I really like Hugh Grant but after 20 minutes I was so bored that I shut it off. I didn't even know what it was about and it did not keep my attention enough to find out.
0393061310|4.0|Great book and well written. Someting to mull about understanding european history. Found the book to be very informative and intellecyually stimulating.
B00BB22GSU|5.0|Great album, but it took me a few listens to really get into. Yes, there are more singles on the previous albums, but MVOTC is a great addition to their discography, and introduces at least 4 new &#34;hits&#34; and a nice evolution of their sound. You'll enjoy the entire album all the way through, except the last track that will be great on loop if you have a haunted house for Halloween. That track aside, Vampire Weekend fans shouldn't be disappointed.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|I use this to mess around. My only complaint was buying the platinum membership did not unlock all the FX I wanted, but still fun.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|Though I am not a hard core fan, I did grow up with the wizard world and I am it bring back memories of wanting to be a wizard and the shame that came with still being a muggle at 25.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Got this for my girlfriend and I to watch one weekend. We're very happy about it, from the DVD version it looks 20 times better on blu ray. All discs worked, wish the packaging was a little different
B000FC11A6|4.0|It's a great book even for the non geeks. Some good sense of humor interwoven in a great story revolving around cryptology. Takes a little bit of time to get used to the narration.
1599290634|4.0|Thank you. Excellent book continuing great series of the illustrations compendiums. Must have for all who love SciFi, illustrators, designers and publishers who works in the genre.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 starts is because I'd like it better if it offered the ability to reorganize by clicking-and-dragging, and to create checklists, with the ability to toggle between a checklist and plain text.  Additional options for notebook covers would also be nice--I'm a very visual person.  Otherwise, I love this app!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|After to listing to this CD 3 or 4 times it was like stepping back to the 70's when I was playing my 8 tracks while cruising the freeways in So. Cal. Great CD, great music!
B006ZN7KMM|2.0|Estoy muy a gusto con mi Kindle, aúnque se ha vuelto a dañar la pantalla. Algo que me parece consecuencia de una reparación con un insumo usado. Las historias son buenas, aunque si esperas desenlaces y conclusiones finales, éste no es para tí. Éste es para que tu saques tus propias conclusiones con una buena dosis de información.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great collectors pack. If you like Indiana's adventures, you will love this.<br />It comes with all of the four movies so you can enjoy even the last one.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Distant Relatives is an excellent CD.  It is inspirational and not too gutter.  It is more like trying to help the audience transcend the gutter mentality.  I like how it tries to connect us all back to the motherland.  Get this CD.  You will definitely feel irie, after listening to the lyrics and sounds on this CD.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was not as exciting as the first & second books unit l the last section.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is extremely engaging and I loved every twist and turn!  I can't wait to play even more of &quot;The Room&quot; once the developers put it out on the market.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|I still miss Jagger, but in this followup, we  get to see the effects of his loss on Yossi.  Yossi is struggling to keep himself moving through the motions of being alive after someone you love has passed away, and in the process finds himself sinking further and further into a state of living death himself.  No matter how hard people try to pull him out, until fate decides to step in and introduce him to a young man with perhaps the same spirit of Jagger himself.<br /><br />Great followup movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I didn't think I would like this game when I first started playing it really grows on you. Now I can't stop playing it. It's sort of like a simplified sudoku game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft  but I think you should add iron Gollum and wolves.  I also think you should add all the things in pc to pe.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I was blown away - really. Great actors: the men make this movie, not the special effects (which are nonetheless amazing). I'd love to see a sequel.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Cool and very fun good for kids I love it .so fun and cool  but I wish there was more places and  cars motocross
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Addicted to this series. I have kept ip with all three. Can't wait for the 4th series to come out.
0345803507|5.0|It is presumed that this gift item was well liked. I am not the greatest gift giver, but seemed natural since she has read the first two of the series.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This has become one of my favorites from Ms. Singh.  The story was engaging and maintained my interest throughout.  For those of you who have read her other Psy/Changeling books, I would rank this one right up there with &#34;Caressed by Ice&#34; and &#34;Kiss of Snow&#34;.  Definitely worth the money and the time!
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I have always loved my plantronics Bluetooth earpiece, but when this came off, I had to use it crippled. Now my earpiece is no longer crippled. I love it!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Not criticizing the movie. Just that I inadvertently clicked the non HD version of this, and there is no way to &#34;un-purchase&#34; something within a couple of seconds on renting the movie.<br /><br />The Hobbit itself is ok.  Nothing like the original series, which were fantastic.  This one had too much CGI, and took too much liberty from the book.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|We enjoyed it. It was a fun movie that didn't send a message, nor did it need to do so.
B000P5FH3K|5.0|I thought this movie was very well done.  Good Casting.  Matt Damon is always very good.  Also liked Jon Voight and Danny DeVito
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I think you can get anything, go anywhere you want with just asking Google!  It's simple to find any answers.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|i think that there should be a password for the child mode and it is cool and i think he should drink water instead of, Apple cider?
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|It's a freebie that I downloaded for the Great Grandkids to play with when they come to see us.  They are so used to these things on their Mom and Dad's I phones.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|i like this but there should be a password to the child mode because people can turn that off easily
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is a very good game, it might be better than minecraft. And for those who don't know how to craft things here's how you do it. You press a square on the crafting grid and tap the appropriate item to put it in the grid and look at the recipe book for how to craft items. The Game Itself is a really good game. You can do quests and fight a more assorted field of mobs. You also have a bigger weapon field that you can use<br />And it also has more realistic graphics. Overall this is an awesome game and for the people who rate it one star. THIS IS NOT A SCAM PEOPLE. Minecraft pocket edition is 7 bucks with less features than this 2$ game. Do the math, this game is good as a game and for your wallet. So think about it.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The authors dexterity speaking in the different characters voices made the book particularly readable for me and difficult to put down until the end.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I really like The Good Wife. I caught up on both Season 2 and Season 3 in a short time thanks to the free episodes on Amazon with the Prime membership. The characters in the series never disappoint. Now I am ready to jump into Season 4!
1400064287|5.0|This book could very possibly change your life if you let it. This is the type of book that you can read for fun and keep it up in your head, but it definitely isn't the best use of this book. Chock full of useful examples and applications, the Heath brothers really made something inspiring and insightful. Everyday, I find myself connecting my actions back to the points they made in the book.<br /><br />Some key points:<br />- Be prepared to have your view of how ideas work be turned upside down<br />- Read the case studies, they provide ways to apply this to your own life<br />- Fun, easy to read, not burdensome to digest<br />- Easy to remember!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I kept missing episodes when they were on the air, and was very disappointed about it. These free with Prime shows make it so easy to get back to catching up. I worked on a marathon catch up with Season 2 and Season 3.<br /><br />The Good wife is always interesting and the characters never dull.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app so much that I have stayed up so long I was sick from sleep depression I LOVE THISS. APP
B00BMTX2QM|5.0|Bring out your dead!! Pallbearer is very heavy but Cathedral Of The Damned is my personal favorite on this CD but all tracks are a tribute to their Sabbath like style and I am sorry to see them go and how about one more tour of the USA,Baltimore Maryland,LOL I saw this group at Hammerjacks way back and have beena fan ever since.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Title says it all. No problems at all; simple GUI; attractive layout; integrates very well with android 4.2.2.; the price is right.
B001B1UO6W|4.0|I remember catching `Child's Play' on television when I was about six years old and I was terrified.  It scarred most of my childhood and yet has grown into this perverse pleasure I have looking back over the whole experience.  In watching the film in my adulthood, it is easy to see how this was so scary to a child.  It's kind of scary to an adult!  I mean, the way that the special effects are used are nearly seamless and help create this truly terrifying atmosphere that gets the blood flowing and the heart pumping.  Dourif's voice is an iconic accompaniment to this horror classic, and will forever be linked to this savage doll.  I have never seen the sequels, although I hear they really mock this original and make it into a joke of sorts, but this original 1988 film is truly terrifying and deserves to be regarded as one of the better horror films out there.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great format and concept.  Enjoyed it thoroughly.  Terrific graphics and appropriately hard.  Hope they do another on the same line.
0895292211|5.0|Although this book is a bit dated, much of it still holds true today.  It is amazing to see how Dr. Edward Howell was so far ahead of his time.  We have much to still discover about the power of enzymes, that is clear.  Kudos to Dr Howell for writing such a forward-thinking and valuable book!
B00C391Y3I|4.0|I love this dvd to listen to. The person doing the editing must have been on speed. I bet there is over 10,000 edits, They can't stay on anyone more than a few seconds. I thought I might be sea sick. Great to listen to with the tv screen turned off..Gotta love a Priest concert!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Most authentic history recreation I have ever seen in a TV show. Can't wait to see where the show goes next.
B009DH379C|5.0|This is probably the best of the Queen concerts. The audio and video are awesome considering the date of the concert.<br />You get all the classics as well as some great footage of Budapest and of the concert preparation.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Picked up his book without any idea what it was about, and was pleasantly surprised. I will never look at my dog the same again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|5stars<br />A sad love story that touches everyone. I really liked the relationship between Gus and hazel and hope to have one like it
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is a great read, another in the Crossfire Series.  Hope that there are more like this one.  I can't wait.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Really great book! If you love myth & magic, then this is the book for you! I can't wait to get the next one! :)
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is a very nice movie, with a touching story that is told well.  The acting is subtle and believable.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Wonderful quality good resolution, good sound, and overall just a wonderful movie. The lines are perfectly placed, and I see something new every time I watch it!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|A pity I finished the book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and love the opening up of new dimensions!<br />Can't wait for his next novel.
B002R88G5E|5.0|We are basically ignorant about what is going on in other countries.  This is such an eye opener and shows us how much we have to be thankful for.  Some people do not belong to be let free amongst decent, honest people who want what is best for their loved ones and family.  Mariam's gift was a sacrifice of self.

B004KPHQR6|4.0|I love the props and costumes used in this older movie. it shows you that high tech was being predicted even then in movies.
0425263924|5.0|I loved this book! It had a lot of action and I could not put it down. It had more action and more of love connection than the first two books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this book! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a page turner full of excitement.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Was an ok movie for me, james franco did an ok job but I can only see he in comedy movies which killed this movie for me. The 3 witches were great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is probably one of my most favorite games, and I really mean it. This game is both challenging and fun at the same time. You have to use your mind to try and figure out each clue and use the clue to crack the code. This is a really fun game, and you should get it. I 'm sure you 'll love it,  and if you don't like it, then this app is free. HAVE FUN!!!!!!! :D
B009RH973I|4.0|I like this case, but it only has the feature to stand horizontally.  It would be nice if it also stood vertically as I travel and on the plane, I like to read from my Kindle and put it on the tray table in front of me instead of holding it in my hand.  The case is hard plastic, so it's somewhat more slippery to hold than a traditional leather case.  I like that the Kindle snaps into it so the strap doesn't cover the screen at all.  Overall, it's a good case for the price I paid.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game but it keeps freezing on my kindle. other than that I really like this game. fun levels and great animation
B0063IH60K|5.0|As I have never played Solitaire before.  This game was easy to learn and play and has fast become a favorite!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My six year old son and had a blast playing this game !!! Not only does it keep you entertained but is a great way to work on memory too. Lots of clues patterns and hidden objects. I look forward to more games like this.
B004LROMSY|4.0|I thought it was going to last at least another year, but no. The Blu-ray is as Blu-rays are, order and enjoy.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Good way to spend some down time. Plenty of board choices. The screen is easy to use and the game provides clear directions.
0143119680|3.0|Discovery of Witches is a paranormal romance about a witch, Diana, who falls in love with a vampire, Matthew.  Their love is forbidden because of an ancient pact made between a council of nine members: three witches, vampires, and daemons.  The story begins at Oxford in England.  Diana is researching alchemy and pulls up an old manuscript at the Bodleian Library.  The manuscript has caught the interest of every daemon, witch, and vampire on campus.  Diana realizes that she is being watched.  Early in the story the reader learns that this manuscript has not been found in centuries.  It is spellbound and no one but Diana can possess it or read it.  She even has difficulty.  The words move on the pages.<br />One of her new stalkers is Matthew, a vampire who falls in love with her at once and marks her with his scent.  His field of study at Oxford is some kind of biology/genetics.  He has been looking for the manuscript for centuries because he knows that it contains secrets of vampire creation through evolution and DNA.  The existence of his race depends on uncovering their genetic mysteries.  Diana soon feels the same way about Matthew.  More trouble at Oxford causes him to become her protectorate, smuggling her out of England and into his family castle in France.  She meets his mother, Ysabeau, and her maidservant, Marthe.<br />It is in France that Matthew and Diana realize that the academic staff at Oxford are not the only ones looking for them.  The ancient council has forbid their relationship and demands the manuscript.  Both Matthew and Diana refuse to obey and more trouble ensues.  The council, a self-elected group that keeps the peace between the supernatural and natural world, kidnaps Diana.  Another mystery unfolds about the death of her father and mother.  The story eventually takes them to where Diana grew-up, upstate New York.  They hide out at her aunts' haunted house and form their own council to reverse the power of the one already in place.  Matthew believes that they can unlock the mystery of Diana's parents' murders, the manuscript, and everything else once they time walk a few centuries back where all of their questions will be answered.  The story abruptly ends without tying up too many loose ends, making room for the sequel-Shadows of the Night.<br />My Review:<br />This story had so many things that I love as a reader: paranormal characters, a mystery attached to an old manuscript, history, a famous library, a secret society (Matthew belongs to the Knights of Lazurus), an interesting genetics twist that gave me a sci-fi feeling, and plenty of imagination.  Harkness made the most overdone things come off as fresh and interesting. For example, the haunted house Diana's aunts live in created another bedroom for visitors.  I also loved the ghosts of her ancestors inside of the house.  I appreciated the research Harkness did about witches, science, and several historical figures.<br />But...  This novel took my several months to finish.  At times, I wasn't sure if I wanted to finish it.  Her writing style was like a very dense and beautiful forest that had overgrown onto the trail, obstructing me from moving forward through my journey.  The book had over five hundred pages.  In my world, it would have been an outstanding read if two or three hundred pages were cut.  Matthew and Diana had too many of the same kinds of conflicts that grew stale.  The descriptions were much too long, slowing the pacing down to an uncomfortable level.  I do think this book would make an excellent movie.  A picture is worth a thousand words, so the plot has plenty of room to move.  I will not be reading the sequel, but do think this book will appeal to paranormal lovers who like to settle into the characters and setting, taking their time in getting to the end.  [...] 3/5 Stars
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Ok, it's a good app and everything, almost like YouTube app, but you seriously have to fix the thing where it doesn't play videos at all or something, it's getting annoying. Other than that I very much like it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Awesome I love it the dragons are awesome and cheap.so random link Bynum Minn Bibb Jun vs stop your your unconfirmed Thu he dBm MrS Kubrick hi breed huh :-) cm :-)

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a fun game to new people.the updated version is a little harder to do multiplayer.one player must be at its world.and go to options.click local server multiplayer.the other player must wait where it creates its world.player two will have to scroll down.if it sees player ones name and click it.I wish there were more mods like in the original version.if I had the originalminecraft I would beat the enderdragon. There are lots of mods.such as spider zombie skeleton etc.I can't wait till the second update.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|Just scary enough to entertain. Love the old Hollywood lines. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves thrillers!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Did not work with kindle aiming device was off screen very bad use of my coins less than one star
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun and increasingly difficult. more levels please. love these games on the web and just as fun on the kindle fire
B009UX2YAC|2.0|It has not let me log into Facebook and I uninstalled it and installed it and it still not helping
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This true story is amazing in itself. It takes place in WWII but the book is more about the two pilots, a 20 year old American commanding a B-17 flying fortress and a  German Ace fighter pilot.  The writing is so well done that by the end of the book,you  know these two men and how they became who they are. I only wish I could have met them myself . .
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|So when I first started using this app it was great but now when I hit &quot;make video&quot; it stops the app. I regret buying now.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|saw it with my son when he was a child helps me remember family  Family fun and fine music enjoyable treat
B005TLY90W|2.0|To my ears this sounds like the efforts of a band that knows it's over.  The members are saving up the good material for their soon-to-be-launched solo careers, and just have to push this album out the door to satisfy their industry obligations.  This album is really awful by comparison with their others.  [[ASIN:B000002L7J Meat Is Murder]] positively kills this album.  So do all of the others.  To me, this album is not The Smiths.
B000P0J024|5.0|I loved this DVD and 2 CD set.  The videos were so cool.  Made me sad that I didn't appreciate the Wilburys when they initially came out around 1988.  Too bad Roy didn't live long enough to participate in the music videos (he died tragically at age 52 as the vides were being made.)  Great product.  Really loved it.
B00AATFJK2|3.0|'Westworld' was a 1973 film written and directed by Michael Crichton and stars a very young Richard Benjamin, James Brolin, and Yul Brynner at the peak of his career. We follow 2 executive types played by Benjamin and Brolin on a vacation to a futuristic theme park based on a wild west of late 19th century America called Westworld, one of 3 themed areas. The others are based on the Middle Ages and the Roman Empire. The 'theme parks' would have remind audiences of 1973 of a futuristic Disney World for adults that are stocked with robots who play the appropriate time period characters. 'Westworld' also sort of predicts the holodeck of Star Trek: TNG and was followed up with several science fiction novels on similar themes such as Larry Niven's 'Dreampark'. The appeal of such a place is that you can do anything you want. Get in a gun fight? Sure. The robots can't kill you but you can kill them. Want a girl? Yep. That as well. However the viewer needs to understand that this as a PG film from the early 1970's and nothing here will appeal to your prurient interest.<br /><br />Of course something has to go wrong and Yul Brynner, playing the 'gunfighter' is the center of the story. Brynner's performance is still chilling and worth the cost of viewing. In all other areas, 'Westworld' is a very dated film. it is poorly scripted, amateurishly directed, and produced more in the style of 1970's TV movies. Acceptable by 1973 standards, it has not aged well and cries for a remake .I hope someone tries to produce a 21st century remake. It deserves it.  Meanwhile go ahead and enjoy this film. The blu-ray edition is very good and much better, vibrant and cleaner than my DVD version.
B004ZJZQ7O|4.0|Overall the package was pleasing. I particularly liked being offered the original theatrical release and extended version of this movie. As the movie itself I thought it was very well made with good performances from Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|It followed the book well.  This was the 2nd time we've viewed it and enjoyed it even more.  The only thing I didn't like about the<br />movie and the book was that the hero dies at the end!
0765325950|3.0|The ending was disappointingly predictable, but otherwise a good read. It closed the series off well, and the war was handled with flair, I thought. It's difficult to do fantasy warts well; most authors fail miserably, but the execution in this book was pretty good.
140131046X|5.0|I had never read a book (or anything else) by Mitch Albom until I picked up \\"Have a Little Faith\\" on a cross-country fight. Albom writes with a style that pulls you into his narrative from page one, and you immediately care about what he has to tell you.<br /><br />In this case, it's a journey of three people: Mitch's rabbi who has asked him to write his eulogy, even though he has only attended services at his synagogue once a year for most of his adult life; an African-American preacher and former drug addict and criminal, who has devoted his reborn life to helping the poor; and Mitch himself who is changed by his encounters, over the course of several years, with both of these men of faith.<br /><br />This is an inspiring account to encourage each of us to \\"have a little faith,\\" to find meaning in the daily things of life, to forgive, to love, to care for those closest to us, to consider the afterlife, to be more faithful to the heart of our faith traditions, to laugh, to sing, to believe....<br /><br />I could go on, but I encourage you to read this book for yourself. It's a fairly quick read, but one that touches something deep inside.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Wow, I did not expect to have so much fun with this app. The other reviews seemed to exaggerate but trust me they didn't. It's a blast. Tons of options...you won't get bored. It really made me feel creative. It's simple to use right out of the box.  It's beautiful and it's fun.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What can I say? The more I hear her the better I like her and the greater the realization just how good she is.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|this game is super fun!!!! the graphics are awesome and the levals are very tricky as you get to higher levels!!!! every one should get this game!!! it is so much fun for everyone!!!!!!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I sat through this movie thinking it would eventually get better. It doesn't. I wouldn't recommend spending money on this film. It doesn't compare in any way to the quality of the original Wizard of Oz.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was beyond amazing. However I hated the ending. I don't understand what happened. Is peeta alive, is he going to survive with the capitol at his throat? Please let him survive, he is my favorite character.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wow, what an addictive game. Makes you really thin and use logical reasoning..Try it and you will be hooked too. IT IS lots fun.
B009POCG0Y|4.0|This film doesn't wait to take things into its hands and before you get used to the characters you hear them swear at each other. It is the most unapologetic opening of films. Even by the end of the film, you are not quite used to the characters because they are that unpredictable and new. But you feel that the director does well with the storyline and the drama/suspense will keep you thrilled.<br /><br />Very good individual performances by all the characters. I absolutely loved the director for the gutsy end and what a song to finish the film with.<br /><br />Would love to see more films of this nature. Devoutly ungodly and ferocious. Very well edited.<br /><br />Must watch!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I think that the story is good but the author is really milking it to get more books out of it.  I was so disappointed to get to the end and see that it was not actually the end.  I completely agree with other reviews who say that they are done with this series because it was originally supposed to be a trilogy but now it has been extended to who knows how many more books, but in reality I will probably get the next books just so I can find out how it all ends.  The sex scenes were good - they make up for the book moving at a super slow pace!
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|After seeing the trailer I bought the books. I like to read the books before I watch the movie. I enjoy seeing the differences between the two. While I enjoyed the movie and it's cuteness, I found the books to be predictable and boring. Yes the movie did not show alot of the building relationship between lena and ethan. It did touch on the basic parts. While amma's character in the book was an integral part and cut drastically from the movie. I enjoyed amma best in the books with her no nonsense attitude. If u want to compare the twilight saga against beautiful creatures there is no comparison as some reviews has shown. I enjoyed this movie so much more than the books as was opposite in the twilight saga.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read book three. The kindle version is great you read anywhere, on your phone, so it's convenient. It was a great read.
B0091REZMW|4.0|i love this game it is really fun the only down fall is waiting for your energy to build back up.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|The app has three different machines to play on and I havent had any problems playing the game. Im also pleased that its not a social network game.
B008KP6ENE|3.0|I asked him how may stars to rate it and he told me 3 so there ya go a 3 star rating.....out of the mouths of babes.......lol
147674355X|5.0|I have to say, I don't normally read romantic books (although that would be a gross generalization of the contents), but this one somehow had enough voice to keep me turning the pages. As I progressed through the book, it just got better and better and better! By the end my mind just exploded and, thus, I could only manage to title this review: \\"WTF!\\" So yeah. Read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it.is better then temple run 1 and 2 it final came with something better then temple that's what I'm talking about.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|I knew what I needed to do but had to nonlinear to get code because there was no coin under the pillow
B005544TRQ|5.0|There is no blood and guts, destruction and anything else in that catagory. This Show is written for the intelligent viewer.It moves fast so the viewer needs to pay attention or a crutial point can be missed..The reparte' between characters is witty and entertaining. I absolutely love it. when is Amazon releasing Season 3 and 4 to Amazon Prime?
0446569909|5.0|This vbook was amazing. I'm so glad I purchased it. Thank you so much. GOD BLESS OZZY! I loved it!:-) rock on
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I totally got into this show when I found it on Amazon Prime. And I'm glad I did. I was able to watch it straight through, without having to wait a week between episodes. Best way to watch! Otherwise I might have really gotten lost. Especially with all the the characters doubling and tripling up like they did from all the different worlds. But, I say all this to say...I LOVED it!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Great cd, great band. This band and cd, and all their cd's can never get old. My five year old son even enjoys :)<br /><br />Great service, great ship time!
B0025T6EY0|5.0|Everywhere Hank turns, something is going to happen that derails him...I love his character and David Duchovny plays everything to the maximum and puts everything that he has into the role of &#34;the Hankster.&#34;  Does a magnificent character move are every turn.  The love that he has for Karen and Becca and palpable and is so sincere it hurts to  watch him being so vulnerable to the problems that keep slamming at him...<br />I await all of the problems and how he skates around them....what a doll....even when he pushes the &#34;broads&#34; away, they somehow manage to sabotage the moment...and I can appreciate that he is so kind hearted and really makes an attempt to stay out of trouble and it always finds him.<br />The language is colorful and delightful and perfect for all of their roles in whatever the situation comes along.<br /><br />Can you tell that I love the series and all of the scenerios that keep appearing.  Great job, all of you that are involved in Californication.  Kudos and accolades.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The idea of looking at the Zombie Apocalypse through interviews with the people who were there is genius. I also appreciate the fact that this threat, and the interviews, span the entire globe. This globe trotting is also where my one minor complaint comes in: so many different nationalities and stories, yet not much difference is made between dialect and language. There is one mention of a translation being made, but much of this probably would have been translated. Because there is no change between dialects and speech patterns many of the characters start to sound the same. This is a minor complaint. Overall, a fantastically inventive read.
B0036T32LQ|5.0|reminds me of the old after midnight scarry stories we grew up with<br />I definately recomend it Se for yourself
B0049VZ222|3.0|The show is amazing and the download was simple.The only problems I have with this product is that you can't copy the video files and transfer them to another computer to watch them. I guess it has some form of DRM. Also the video and audio quality were not the greatest.Without the DRM and audio/video quality problems I would have given 5 stars.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is a superb rendition of an old classic performed by many artists in the past and present. The surprise is that it all transpires in the present. All the cast play their parts to perfection, all contributing to a high quality and fun mystery which keeps you glued to the tube. I just ordered season two and can't wait till it arrives.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|There app is very good and allows you to play MTG when you don't have others to game with. No more carrying several decks around. I've had a bit of trouble with some of the special abilities of the cards, especially removing cards from the graveyard.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|I absolutely love Six Feet Under. I give the show 5 stars. The shipping from amazon was horrible the box was torn and the plastic casings inside were cracked and broken. I ordered all seasons of six feet under and only one of the five boxes was in mint condition all other four boxes were broken, cracked and ripped. The box they came in was in good condition so it seemed like the products was already damaged at the Amazon facility. It almost seemed like they had dropped it or smashed it before even shipping it out. I havent had any issues with shipping from amazon until this time.
B00BGIC170|5.0|My wife and I loved it. Very funny and I can relate since I have hit the 40 mark. We would recommed to all adults!
B002ZG98J6|5.0|My son absolutely loves the Percy Jackson series of books and he loved the movie. The movie doesn't really follow the book completely but it is still a great movie to watch. I would suggest you have your children read the book first then watch the movie. I also had my sixth grade class read this book and compare it to the movie. Absolutely great movie, now it is part of my classroom and home collection.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great Movie! I was a little leary about buying the movie but it was well worth it. Get ready its a long one too!
B004K7HMJ6|4.0|Jessie is clearly a talented vocalist.  She has more vocal chops than many of today's popular singers.  Her style has bits of R&B, Pop, and even a smattering of Jazz.  This album, while it does NOT contain Jessie's hit single Domino, is still quite strong.  It has her hit Price Tag, as well as concert favorites like Big While Room.  Buried toward the bottom of the track list is L.O.V.E., which is my favorite.  It hasn't garnered any radio play to speak of in the U.S., but it has a groove that is reminiscent of producer Mark Ronson's tracks with Amy Winehouse.  It also showcases the freedom and agility that Jessie commands at the top and bottom ranges of her voice.  All in all, it's a strong album, and I'll be looking to see what Jessie releases next.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I've had the watch for 11 days now.<br /><br />For the first couple days, it gained +3 seconds a day. Then it jumped up to 11 or 12 seconds a day, which is where it has stayed for the last 8 or 9 days. Assuming it doesn't get worse I'm okay with this (considering the price). The watch isn't too hard to set. The only challenge was making sure the second hand started at zero at the beginning of a new minute. The technique became very easy after figuring it out the first time.<br /><br />The watch is an appropriate size. It's small but has a simple design (almost military-like) that would look awkward if it were much bigger. It's sized just right for men or women to wear. The design is attractive and I'm glad I picked the green version of this watch. It's eye-catching without being flashy. It doesn't look &#34;cheap&#34;, if you're afraid of that.<br /><br />I could ramble on about every detail of the watch, but I won't. If you're reading this and you want to know anything go ahead ask me.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Having heard the tracks that Fun. had on the radio, I was interested to see what else they had to offer.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had more arrows in their musical quiver than what their hit songs showed.  The non-hit tracks share the broad, sweeping, anthemic quality that Fun.'s hit songs have demonstrated.  The production is thorough, perhaps heavy handed to some listeners' ears, but to me it sounds like what Queen might be doing if they were still releasing albums with Freddy Mercury.  While I didn't feel there were any major clunkers or filler tracks on this album, I also didn't feel like there were any unreleased gems either.  It's all good, and I would recommend the album if you liked the radio hits, but it's not revolutionary.  I will certainly be willing to buy more of Fun.'s music in the future.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is really great for everyone it I'd really funny and if you and bored and its raining it is a great way to be happy again
B000002KXV|4.0|When I purchase a Donald Fagen album, I'm looking for some specific things.  Because he is the lead singer of the legendary Steely Dan, I want the Jazzy sound that I come to expect from Steely Dan exhibited in his solo work as well.  Furthermore, I want the enigmatic lyrics, as well as the strong instrumental performances from the players that spin in orbit around Fagen and Steely Dan. I own all of Steely Dan's albums, and I had all of Fagen's solo efforts other than The Nightfly. I bought this one to fill in my collection, and I was not disappointed. The Nightfly had everything I expected, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It also is the source of some of the rarities that Steely Dan performs in concert. For someone that likes Steely Dan or Fagen, this album is a no brainer. It's quite good.
B00BV9S01U|4.0|Before Tawny was sliding down the hood of a sports car, and before the bands image image was as polished as their songs, (which is fine if that what you're into) Whitesnake was a classic bluesy hard rock band. If you want to hear where it all started with Whitesnake, this is a great collection of studio and live performances neatly packaged in mini album covers and housed in a cool cardboard anvil case. There's a lot of bite & venom in this set and it's definitely worth picking up.
145211207X|5.0|This book is light on words and heavy on art...and that is a good thing.<br />I would recommend this book even if your not a big Pixar fan and just appreciate good artwork.
B00773YOB4|3.0|I like this album, it's pure Bonnie, and so many of her songs touch my heart.<br /><br />But, Jeebus! Every time it comes up on my ipod, it blasts me out of the room! Why is this album so much louder than my others? It's really annoying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a very fun game to play, similar to temple run but good in its own way. I would recomend it to anybody of all ages.
1594204217|5.0|As always, Michael Pollan delivers a fascinating read. You never finish one of his books without being enlightened and inspired. As a foodie and someone who loves to cook, it was a real treat to learn about food through the lens of the elements: fire, air, water, earth.
B00CWVGS10|3.0|Story line was good but could have been so much better. Too much time spent leading up to the actual good part when they could have really msued up the ending sequence. Worth renting for an evening in.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Lean In reminds all that the workplace is in and outside of the home so complete responsibilities to the best of one's abilities and figure out &#34;what s next?&#34;
B00B69UQEO|2.0|The album has all the basic elements that I like (synthesizers, drum machines, guitars, singing) but I have a hard time listening to it.  I've liked Depeche Mode since the 80's but this album doesn't do it for me.  Seems a lot of people like it but it's not my cup of tea.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cool game.  Sometimes lags on kindle<br />Overall realistic looking.  Would recommend it for sure<br />Haven't put it down for a while now
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I purchased this collection for my family, and they are so happy with it. We liked the collection presentation, because has very nice sketch, and the quality of the video and audio is very good.<br />I recommend the product to the Indiana Jones fans.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|this app is so cool. I just started it, but it is awesome...... nom nom is as cute as always,  and the double action rocks.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|is a fun easy game for my kid she loves that you can do makeup and dress her and is not hard u wash her hair give her a spa and make it how ever you'd like.
0446547646|5.0|I am a fan of this author, and have never disliked a book written by Nicholas Sparks.  I love his style of writing, his subject matter, and he is one of the few contemporary authors that I am sure to ALWAYS stay up with his books.
0920668372|5.0|Read this to my children!!! My daughter gave me one for mothers day and I gave her one for her first mothers day!!!!  Teaches the deep love a mother has for her child and how that deep love carries over to that child and passed on to the next generation!!!  The ending will send you to tears!!!!  What an absolutely beautiful story of deep love between a mother and child!!!!!!!  Would highly recommend reading this book and keeping it to pass on to next generations!!!  Beautiful!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great puzzle game for a free app.  The app gets more challenging as the levels increase.  Looking forward to more levels to complete.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's challenging and addicting just when I think it's getting easy they hit me with a really tough floor I highly recommend this game
B004P8HQL4|5.0|I live in San Francisco and it's really scary to walk down a steep hill with my stroller in front of me, knowing that if I trip my baby could roll away. It was difficult to find one of these safety tethers sold separately from a stroller - a local retailer suggested I use a dog leash, but it was too long and looked sloppy. I like the slight stretchiness of this neoprene fabric - it's comfortable and easy to slip on and off my wrist (I only use it on steep hills). I am buying a second one for our other stroller.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|This is a great movie.  they do not make movies like this anymore.  kids still love it.  good clean fun
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I wish I could find more like this one.  I love love to play this.<br />I'm on this game almost every day.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My wife expressed a desire for a comple copy of the series and now we have it. Very pleased with the copies.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It can get boring most of the time. It doesn't challenge me all the time..<br />So I don't play it very often.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Excellent game. Smooth gameplay and fun multiplayer. Only bad thing is my game won't update and I don't know how to manually update. Help please!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|The quell games are so challenging. I'm totally addicted to all three quell games. I feel good if I can solve the puzzle much less get a perfect score. Quell momento takes the game to another level with more obstacles and fabulous graphics.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game that keeps getting more challenging as you play.It will hold your interest no matter how much you play.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Brought this for my sit- n-stand stroller that didn't have a cup holder.  It fits well on the stroller and I have packed it full of drinks, toys, sunglasses, etc.  also, it is a good size so my other kids can still sit or stand in the back of the stroller.
1620404869|2.0|This story had some potential, with witty language and fun self-dialogue.  However, it falls terribly short as a story.  I would place it just above the dime store novel.  Jane Austen never failed to endow her stories with true-to-life morals.  The only thing I learned from this book is that life isn't worth living without a hotty by your side, and that fantasies really do come true.  It also tantalized and bordered on Harlequin.  I listened to the story aloud as I worked and sometimes I ran to turn it down so that my kids wouldn't hear it.  It never fully crossed any lines, but I don't think Austen would have been happy with all the causes for blushing.  So, if you're contemplating spending money on this one, don't.  If you must read it, borrow it from the library.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|Does not quite live up to the standards of his other Sigma Force novels. The plot is just way too far fetched
B008YKGQR4|4.0|This app was good to use although the only bad thing is you can't hide the ads at the bottom but otherwise this app rocks and makes using Facebook awesome.
B00BFPX132|4.0|After reading a few reviews that rated this album poorly I wasn't expecting much but I can honestly say that I have enjoyed Epitome of Torture quite a bit since receiving it.  I don't care too much for the artwork on this album, but the quality of music here doesn't disappoint.  The album starts out strong with My Final Bullet and closes up with a strong finish with Waterboarding and Splitting the Atom which are my two favorite songs on the album.  I like the production/mix on this one a lot more than In War in Pieces.  If you are a fan of Sodom, this is worth buying.  For fans new to Sodom I recommend starting out with Agent Orange or Tapping the Vein.
B00CM9JKXU|5.0|In a word, metallic! And all the other elements that have been missing such as progressiveness, intelligent lyrics, creativity, passionate vocals, variety, etc. A World Without is just quintessential, a sound not heard since Promised Land. And of course, La Torre is pretty much a Godsend. Admittedly, this phenomenal effort sends my and many fans' hopes through the rafters for their second album. Also, I think Tate will do good on his own - if he can reassess his career and recapture his heart. A genuine thank you to all involved with this version of Queensryche, thank you for not staying gone forever!
0547258305|5.0|This book will sweep you away.  What a great story, I think about it when I'm not reading it and can't wait to jump back into the book when I'm away.  Such a great book, I can't stop talking about it to everyone!
B00957T6X6|5.0|I rarely stray from historical non-fiction, but I was intrigued by the popularity of the HBO series, which appeared to be set in medieval times.  I prefer to read books before watching the film so that I don't have pre-concieved notions as I read.  The books are  totally engrossing.  Since I started this series my kindle is always within an arms length.  I read as I walk through the house, walk to the mailbox, etc.  The central characters are all fairly complex so that you never completely love or hate any of them.  I highly recommend this series to anyone, regardless of your literary leanings.
B0073V7YTY|5.0|I was warned not to use it for professional purposes as the range of sound is limited to the microphone of the tablet.<br />But as it is its very interesting to notice how small consistent sounds build up to quite a high noise level. Such as fans, air conditioners and other electric appliances.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|I would stay with the standar def, this movies in HD don't lokk so good, in this case de HD isn't an upgrade
B006S08RLU|5.0|Great French Romantic movie. Great movie for practicing, learning French, and learning about culture.<br />I recomend. It won an Oscar for a reason.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|Saw this in a movie theater shown in 3D and a great sound system, and, for the most part, enjoyed it there.  But even while watching it I felt more like I was just in a long amusement park dark ride, where things keep popping out at you as your ride car ambles through on a track, rather than in a movie theater watching a film with an interesting story and characters you care about.  Characters are introduced to keep the plot moving forward, but are never fleshed out (pun intended) except for the lead character, Gerry, played by Brad Pitt.  So, while the action is formidable and the CGI effects are truly amazing, it never really grabs you in the gut or heart, and it's obvious it was meant to.  My recommendation, then, is to be sure and see it in a big-screen, great-sound-system 3D movie theater if you're at all interested in it--it will not play well on a small screen (which in my opinion includes even the biggest screen home TV, even if it's a 3D model).
B00B19DW0E|3.0|I give this movie 5 stars for being one of John Carpenters best when he could still direct (and write). I give the rest 1 star for the following; as I was watching it I noticed that there were odd cuts and fade outs, then I realized that it had edited scenes for some reason. Now I get to see this free for my Prime membership but please just put EDITED in big letters next to the title so I don't waste my time. Ignore this version movie and watch something that Amazon hasn't screwed with, or just buy the blu-ray disc.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|The game draws you in and if you have lots of patience - loving every day spend lots of time playing building gold and waiting for gems in about a month you might get level 2 gear - its geared towards pay to play - but you can play without paying - as someone said - its painfully slow that way
B004HWYTP4|5.0|What an incredible cast!!!!! At first I wasn't sure I would engage with this film but after about ten minutes, I was hooked. Great story line, solid performances by the entire cast. Who knew John Malkovich could get any weirder? Can't wait to see the sequel.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the twists and turns this book took. I never knew which character to root for and which one to hate. Way to go
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is really awesome, trust me! It's just that it took forever to download/install. :( But, other than that, I love it!
B0047WJ12K|4.0|This movie was good, it kept me guessing.  I liked Leonardo DiCaprio he was very convincing.  I did not like the ending.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is about a very interesting world with depth. This book is a little hard to get into at first but stick with it and you will be rewarded. The characters and the world they live in are amazing. The story progression and growth of the characters is great if you are a fantasy fan then this is a must read!
193700788X|1.0|I loved all of the other books.  This book was a waste of time.  It was not exciting or well written, It just left me hanging and I just feel it was an attempt to extract money for another publication.  I really don't like that.  the character's lives were not pulled together.  I am really sorry I bought the book because I was really looking forward to it for a REALLY LONG TIME.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is unlike any before! It makes you use your brain in order to escape the floors. This app is similar to 100 floors - but requires more use of surrondings. Deserves all 5 stars
B00BY1F8UQ|4.0|Jarrett continues to impress. I could listen to this all day. His vocal meanings are kept to a minimum. Fine by me.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|The movie was enjoyable but I thought the plot could have been thicker or more story to the movie. I would still give it 4 stars for what it had.
B000002H2H|5.0|I don't have too much to add to the myriad 5 star reviews. If for some reason you are on the fence about buying this album, just buy it. It starts out with three fantastic metal songs and just gets better and better.  The final song on this album creates an entirely new type of music, combining metal with classical music in an instrumental that will blow your mind.  It's hard to believe an album like this was made by mortals.  Arguably the best album ever, not just metal, but all rock.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a great movie very entertaining! Good quality time to sit down with the kids and some popcorn!! Have watched several times doesn't get old!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Discovered this game while trying to find a new challenging HOS after completing The LostCity.  We tried the free version first and decided to buy the full version. We really enjoyed playing the HOS mystery game so much, and are thrilled that we don't have to wait forever for Enigmatis 2!  This is a must play that unfolds like a great murder mystery novel!
4789009637|4.0|I went into buying this book for 7 dollars and change, it turned out to be a pretty good investment. I already knew quite a bit of Japanese but it gave me quite a few kanji that I hadn't memorized, and some that i still have not memorized in an easily digested format.<br /><br />note: I also bought the companion cd.<br /><br />The only significant complaint that I have about this book is that such a solid chunk of it is working with partner material which is silly. When I practice speaking Japanese I am not going to do it with a native English speaker and ruin my accent for life, I am going to practice with Japanese natives.<br /><br />On the whole I would say this is a very solid book. The only book that has helped me more is &#34;A guide to reading and writing Japanese.&#34; I bought this book also and it was useful for memorizing the Toyo kanji.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|The product arrived quickly and works mostly as I expected. Having the dual ports is a real bonus. I did try having a Blackberry and an iphone charging at the same while using the iphone for music and nav but this still resulted in my charge going down. Its possible I had them plugged into the wrong ports, I will need to verify.<br /><br />When I had only the iphone plugged in it works as expected.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am an avid Sylvis Day fan and have many of her books.  I have to say that her Crossfire series is one of my favorites by her.  I remember being excited when I found out the release date of Entwined in You and was able to pre order it.  The book didn't dissapoint me at all, however what did was the extension from a trilogy to a longer series when not expected.  I have fallen in love with these characters and their story line.  I am looking forward to the release date of the next book Captivated by You so I can pre order it.  Well worth the read for romance fans who like a little spice in their books!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|what else is there to say? all three movies kick some serious arse. just keep the prequels out and I'm happy.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Was the last one in the series I needed to buy and was glad I waited and got such a great deal.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|The setting of this film is in the British countryside.  Wonderful portrayal of the sensibilities of a bunch of older<br />artist as the age and interact.
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|I found this movie predictable and little or no humor so evident in the earlier movies, only a few really parts.
B00CGPPMKU|2.0|Am I missing something? Like the ability to draw on pictures. Maybe I missed it, but this seems to be left out. If the description didn't mention it, I would not be rating based on this, but it did.
B007P2DQJI|5.0|It is just a replacement for the original battery. It is the exact same model/number so if you think the original was good at first, you will get the same results with this one.
B005544TRQ|3.0|Pretty ok show. Not too shabby but not too deep and / or exciting either. I probably won't pay for it if it were not included in prime
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|I've been listening to Bastille on Absolute Radio online from the UK for a few months now. I've waited and waited for their album to be released here in the U.S., but no luck. So I finally gave in and ordered the import version. So glad I did, it's spectacular from start to finish. We've only had the chance to download a handful of Bastille's songs here so far, but the entire album does not disappoint. Worth the extra money to get it. Don't hesitate. If you love Snow Patrol, The 1975, even Keane, give Bastille a listen, you won't be sorry!
B005MLOOJA|4.0|An interesting story. And fairly complex / twisting story too. I don't know what else or what more to write.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|this is a great product for someone who travels often and wants to protect and keep their ear piece charged.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app I'm on it all the time. Me and mh brother are always trying to beat each others scores even though he is winning with 580997. And I have 400981
B00CWY76CC|4.0|a quick entertaining game. This game is not too hard or too easy. Great for the young and old who love detective works.
1932100660|5.0|As a dietitian I can tell you this book is the bible of nutrition. An absolute must read. Get it!
B00992CF6W|3.0|It would be the best game if it had all the update that the Xbox360 has, but I know that is not going to happen anytime soon. The realms for minecraft is dumb, every time I try to join it won't work, if you could fix that then that would be awesome.
159562015X|5.0|it was helpful in defining goals. I came away with a truer sense of what I was meant to do.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable room escape game, not the most challenging puzzles, but I would certainly recommend it. More levels soon please!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this I  a great game for horse lovers! It includes feed in  grooming competition buying all different kinds of horses cleaning there stalls and training and so much more I think this is also a great game for all age  I think it ha  good graphics has goo  explanation on wan  to do and what your different goals are and I think you should  get this app all the things I jus  mention  in this review are absolutely free! I love this game so much I love horses<br />  Mikyla Malone<br />  Age 13  :)
B0034G4ORC|3.0|I purchased this movie bu tI have seen it before.  It keeps up the pace and never dulls throughout the whole movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great Game! Got it for 6.99, and it is so close to the PC version that the price is about to go up, so get it as soon as possible. 0.7.0 added, Fire! Buckets! Cake! Wheat! Some small caves! Smooth lighting! Next update should include Endermen is what I heard, so be.prepared!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I don't remember ever giving a movie 5 stars but Liam Neeson couldn't be beat in this film.  I wish that I could say that about &#34;Taken 2&#34;.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|U have to have gameloft live to get past fail to connect its free so u can get and have fun
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I really enjoy the study notes and references.  The Kindle version works well, the search feature is very useful.  I originally only had the free ESV Bible for Kindle, but found myself using my Kindle Bible along with my paper ESV Study Bible for the notes, so I got the ESV Bible for Kindle, too.  The price was very good so I don't mind having both.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's good for the kids and when your bored it's a good game to play it fun and its very exciting
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I downloaded this app several times , but it would not install on my Kindle Fire. I have given up on it.
B007JGAR6U|5.0|I have the EF-20 Fuiji flash for my x100 and XP1. It works OK most of the time, but is large and bulky. I ordered the EF-X20 not just because of size, but also because I thought it might offer better EV adjustment. I was pleasantly surprised that indeed TTL metered fill-flash appears to work much better with the EF-X20 compared to the EF-20. Of course the settings may be different for each lighting situation, but I have found that -2/3 EV exposure works well for most outdoor backlight subjects that need some fill-light. The internal diffuser is also a plus for use with the new 14mm lens. The flash takes AAA batteries, which seems like a pain as most other devices take AA, but they are required to keep the device small. I purchased a set of 4 AAA rechargeable batteries which work fine in my AA/AAA charger and I carry the extra 2 in my bag so I am never without a fresh battery. That said, I have never had to change the batteries in the field even with moderate flash use. Whether or not it is fair for Fuji to charge what they do for this flash is not for me to judge, but I would say that I think this unit is a significant improvement over the cheaper EF-20 and it is recommended if you can fit it into your budget.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Engrossing...can't put it down.  Great for a free game and addicting.  Have had no issues with the game on Kindle Fire.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great games love the challenge.  Need more levels but for free it is good.<br />Would consider buying full version.love love
0061765236|5.0|This is just the third Picoult novel I have read so far, my favorite is still &#34;Harvesting the Heart&#34;, but this one had me glued to it hoping for the best outcome possible!
B003L20IFQ|2.0|A bold move, making a movie set entirely inside a coffin.. full of innovative ideas to keep the action as fresh as possible, with an involving performance from Ryan Reynolds.. however, all that effort just doesn't quite get over the fact that this is a movie - set in a box.<br />We open the movie with Ryan Reynolds waking up in the titular state, and becoming aware of his surroundings.  As he calls on his phone for help and tries to contact his family, we learn how it happened, and Reynolds convincingly portrays the different stages of emotion one might expect to feel under such circumstances.  A multitude of camera angles, a surprising variety of lighting and varying tones as his conversations switch from his potential rescuer to his family to the perpetrator, do their best to keep involvement at its peak.  In the end though, it ultimately seems a somewhat shallow affair  - it is clever and intelligent enough to be thought provoking, but the premise limited enough that the thoughts provoked don't go far.<br />Plaudits to all concerned, not least Reynolds for holding his own throughout the movie, and to the imagination of cinematographer and director - I love to see movies that experiment like this being made.. but it doesn't stop me finding in the end that this particular experiment didn't quite cut it.
B00CGPPMKU|2.0|??Whats the point of this ?? You make the lines but the game does the laceing... not very interactive though but it's still pretty cool 2 stars
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is annoying when the game subtely shows lock boxes. Hidden things should look hidden. It may be fun escaping, but it should be more fun to find hidden items.
B00881VLCE|5.0|GREAT PUZZLES. Should definitely get. A lot of really good puzzles to choose from. Better than all the other puzzle apps.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This show was off the chain.  Great writers and wonderful performers.  Each episode kept me glued to the TV, waiting anticipating what was to come.  When it was over I couldn't wait for Season 2 to begin.  I was disappointed.  GREAT SHOW.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|I tried this hoping I could get out of the office with this app but it just didn't work out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so much fun I love it when he jumps I love it when he turns left & right. it's awsome
B0087XBUS8|5.0|I have been wanting to get to this book for a long time. I finally did. The crafting of this book is highly brilliant and intelligent. I loved it from start to finish. Although some storylines more than others and definatley one House more than the others. It is the kind of book you will love reading at night.for me it was a page turner and difficult to put down. The character and houses seem confusing at first, but really it falls into place. There is never al dull moment in this book whatsoever. I look forward to starting the HBO which closely follows the book. I look forward to completing the series.(less)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game! New update is really cool. Everyone should get this game. If you ever use seeds nyan is a great one for survival!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Call me bold but as I said. This is the best series since Twilight. I am so happy someone decided to get off the vampire and demon trend. This authors work is brilliant and the writing and depth she puts into weaving her stories with fairytales, politics, culture, romance has me mesmerized. I am on book 2 and it's much more riveting than the first in my opinion. She plans for a number 3 and 4 I could squeal I am so happy. If you are a Star Wars fan like me you will love Book 2. This is author is up and coming and I for sure hope to see a movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved this book!  Now I can't wait to see the movie...fast moving, touching, perfect!  I recommend this to anyone who has been touched by mental illness, whether it be a friend, family member or themself.  :)
B005TD4GTO|4.0|Solid album.  I enjoyed it.  But then again, I'm a big fan of Oasis, and am trying to find any extension of their mid to late 90s greatness.  Like most solo acts of great bands, this ends up sounding like a watered-down version of what a great band used to sound like.  Still good for the right price.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love how easy this calculator is to use. Numbers are big enough for accurate calculations and it has all the practical functions I need to use on a regular basis. Excellent app choice!
0316223239|5.0|I began reading the book and soon discovered I could not put it down. I finished the book in two days.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I hate that the first few seasons are free and starting on season 4 it is 1.99 per show. this seems to be a repeating pattern with prime membership on amazon, most of the good shows have a fee, makes the membership not worth the cost. I do not order enough to justify the cost, did it for the free web streaming but to my great disappointment , the fees. would not renew prime membership for the tv benefit, value not there. save your money to pay the movie rental fees
0471043729|4.0|This book is a summary of all electrochemist topics that you have to know. I fully recommend it to people that want to start a library in electrochemistry.
1401322786|5.0|I have loved every single one of this books and this one was not a disappointment!  He was true to form.  It was different than I expected.
B007NG93CK|3.0|Too much technicality on the medical aspect. Forced me to speed read a couple of pages. Also a bit tedious with the French translations. Otherwise, the story not bad. I was quite disappointed.
1416955070|5.0|Had to read before the movie comes out, SO GLAD I DID!  I had just finished the Newsflesh Trilogy & didn't think the very next series I started would grip me like the books by Mira Grant.  I was so wrong.  Cassandra Clare got my attention, held my interest & sent me back to Amazon to purchase Ashes as soon as I finished Bones.  So far book two has me & I look for any time I can steal a few minutes to read a few pages.  Thank you Cassandra, for sharing the world you created with the rest of us!
B0051XSKSU|1.0|I downloaded this movie and I have had it for slightly over 1 month I went to watch it while driving down the road and amazon has lost there licensing for this for me to watch it digitally on my kindle fire. Now there telling me even thought I bought the movie and I own it I can no longer watch it due to they have temporarily lost licensing to this. This is like if I went to walmart and I bought a dvd and they showed up to my house and said they lost the licensing to sell it they have to take it back. this is very disappointing and when speaking to the reps which is not there fault they basically say this is amazons policy this is how it works buying digital movies even thought you buy and own them you can no longer watch the movies because they lost rights. I will no longer buy any digital movies and now regret buying a amazon kindle fire because I can not use it for my children like I planned I guess I will just buy a portable dvd player for my car very disappointing amazon
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's awesome.<br />I give it a five star score .<br />I like that it has all the words I need to know.<br />I would recommend this book to my cousin Makayla Jackson and my cousin Aniya Huffman.
B004GYY714|5.0|How wonderful to be able to use my Kindle to tune into radio stations all over the world. If this were the only app available for a Kindle, it would still be worth buying a Kindle.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Watching this at home on my Blu-ray player on my big screen television was an awesome experience.  It was like seeing it brand new all over again only now I can pause and replay my favorite scenes over and over again.
0307352153|5.0|This is a missionary book. Susan Cain wants to change the way Americans perceive and think about Introverts. She also wants to change the American work- place and educational system in accordance with her understanding. First, an introvert is not as I automatically assumed one who is 'shy'. An Introvert may be shy, but the real definition of the concept according to her is that the Introvert prefers an environment in which there is not great External Stimulation. She says that our ethic today is to give preference to extroverts, and to suggest that this is the ideal personality type. Her defense of Introverts however shows that they in their creative efforts are especially important. She speaks of many great figures in history whose 'introversion' has been an essential element in their thought. All the great religious teachers, she says, had their 'wilderness time' when in solitude they had their great visions. Cain writes movingly too about her own personal experience in which she at times sacrificed the kind of way of life she most wanted. She is pragmatic and wise, and not out to converting all the world to being the way introverts are. She claims they are one- third to half of the population. She understands when even the introvert is helped and requires the skills of the extrovert. But what she suggests is that our society has become imbalanced in one direction, and needs righting. She too suggests that each person should find their own proper balance in order to make the good life for themselves.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This is as very good app, but it's exactly like flow FREE. The sound effects are cool but I still like flow FREE better. (Did I mention that neon flow is 99 cents and flow FREE is free.)
034580404X|5.0|I held of on ordering this set but now that I'm half way through the first book, I can't put it down! Fantastic.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this and seeing the negative reviews breaks my heart!  I adore Gideon!  I'm ecstatic that this SERIES not TRILOGY is not over.  It's beautifully romantic and the sex is earth shattering!!  Eva and Gideon truly find each other in this book..but, its more than the sex or romance.  Gideon worships his relationship with Eva..this is what keeps me coming back!  My, what it would be like to be loved by Gideon!!  Keep them coming, Miss Sylvia Day!!
B005LAIII0|5.0|This is a beautiful movie, visually and story line.  If you are looking for classic American cinema with a clear beginning, middle and end that makes you feel warm and fuzzy this is NOT your movie but if you enjoy a movie that forces you to look within while being simply beautiful to watch this would be a great choice.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I only ever saw the pilot episode of the first season & by the time I started watching it again, this show was in Season 6. So now I'm going back & watching the first 5 seasons.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Shawshank Redemption is a classic tale that has been perfectly transformed from Stephen King's written word. A &#34;Must-have&#34; for anyone's DVD collection; I could watch again and again!!
1612183956|5.0|I read Pines after coming across an article with M. Night Shamalyn. M. is in production for the TV FOX adaptation of the novel. I read the book, couldn't put it down. Knowing that Blake Crouch was a Twin Peaks fan and that this novel was inspired by that series also went a long way to pleaasing me.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game challenges the mind to look for clues and find ways to get to the answer.  Just when you're about ready to throw the towel, everything clicks.  Now that's fun!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story was excellent and although I have seen the movie a few times, reading the book really added  and helped explain the story.  A great read for anyone liking human interaction and adventure.
0143116738|2.0|NOT REALLY A LOT OF SUBSTANCE, JUST SOME SUPERFICIAL COMPARISIONS OF WELL KNOWN PEOPLE'S LIVES<br />BUT HASN'T REALLY GIVEN ME ANY REAL POINTERS TO LIGHT BULB MOMENMTS

B006R4H5FG|5.0|This makes things so easy, it stops you making PowerPoint the master of you.  Learn how to make people sit up and take notice of your message.  A great and easy read, try it, it does make a difference.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|The end was good. Rachel was beautiful. The effects were nice. But this movie single handedly made me hate James Franco. How does one DO that? Kunis was forgettable
B001N3GUIE|5.0|If you are a fan of science fiction this is a must have for your library. This is a ground breaking movie that still holds it own against anything Hollywood is releasing today.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|I haven't had a chance to try it out yet, but based off of what I've seen so far, here goes.<br /><br /> - Packaging - 3/5 stars. It came in an envelope. Inside the envelope was the syringe in picture in a plastic bag. The bag says &#34;Arctic Silver 5 Poly-synthetic Thermal Compound Paste 3.5g New&#34;. I'm disappointed that it didn't come in some sort of box or slightly protective packaging to make sure the cheap plastic syringe didn't bust into a million pieces in transit.<br /><br /> - Shipping Speed - 4/5 stars. While it did come the day advertised, I'm disappointed that I chose 1 day shipping and it didn't arrive until today (7/2). My order was placed on 6/29, so I slightly understand, hence the 4 stars.<br /><br />As far as everything else, this review will be updated as soon as I figure it out. I will be using this on my Intel Core i7-3770K and hopefully it gets the job done.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Every song on this album is wonderful.  The soulfulness and range of emotion depicted in Melody's music is so moving. I play it over and over.
B008ROFVT6|5.0|Camelot is a great musical. I especially love Richard Harris! I saw this movie when it first came out many years ago.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I just finished reading Mira Lyn Kelly's book, Waking Up Married. It is a delightfully frolicking tale of a relationship that seems doomed from the start. It is an excellent book with several twists and turns to the plot.
B002NJWHHA|4.0|It is a predictable story but I always like watching the bad guys lose. The effects are pretty good, and it something I can watch with my whole family.
B004J1DBJI|2.0|sometimes it's very smart, and sometimes very dumb.<br />example: I asked it &#34;Chris Martin&#34; it gave me a football player,<br />I asked again, Chris Martin (coldplay) still went back to Football player.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Unfortunetely now game is very unstable, have many bugs &amp; often fall down or can't load a game...I'm very angry because game is interesting for me, but it's not playable in this form:(
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book!  I hope the next one comes out sooner rather than later & answers all of the questions.  Very quick & easy read.
0307279189|5.0|I especially loved the dispelling of all the hype about super-duper &#34;support&#34; needed for our feet when our feet are designed to &#34;find the ground&#34; and respond to the hardness of the ground. what a scam all the bucks we spend on shoes!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|i brought it on my Kindle and it wouldnt even install!! im very upset that i wasted money on a game that wouldnt even download!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Hurry up with more levels . Addictive fun and didn't half have the brain working .perfect for a lazy Sunday morning in bed
0425252868|4.0|I am enjoying the book very much.  Alot of personal feelings of the characters involved concerning the war, I like.  For just the general reader, some of the writing about the planes, engines, formations more technical data was over my head.  I imagine it would be very enjoyable and interesting to anyone in the service or interested in airplanes.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I waiting for this album so much and finally i have it in my hands, this album exceeded all my expectations and i love it.<br /><br />This album is amazing !
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game but it needs to update more often and takes for ever to update on kindle fire, all my friends had the 7.0 update 2 weeks before I did but this is still such a great game I will rate this 4 stars
B0000028M7|5.0|This is the better album from Alice in Chains, the best album in the history of grunge, i love all song :) !
B00D2K40WY|4.0|It is a bit comical. I hope they take good care of their own faces when they r teenagers.<br /><br />My 4&amp;6 year old love this game!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|it was a great book the best book i have ever read. im definitely going to read the whole series
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game I highly recommend buying it although you can get it for free there is just a few games unlike this one and it is really addicting
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very interesting book.  A little too much medical information to absorb but I enjoyed it.  I would highly recommend reading it.
B009FRS9CA|5.0|This Figure is Awesome. Great articulation, great sculpt, even comes with a good stand.<br />Gonna be straight to the point, the pros and cons.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The Packaging - I ordered it on my local dealer and pick it up myself, had to choose between two, picked the nicer one which of course the most \\"brand new\\" looking. I was so happy to get it in that condition with the wonder what happened to the other one as theres alot of shelf wear looking. After which I went out for the whole day with the figure on hand in a plastic bag and as i got back home, I found some dents and shelf wear looking at some of the corners/tips of the packaging, was abit dissappointed with it at first but to think of it, I'm gonna take the figure out of the packaging anyways, so whats the point, put it aside, dont want to see it anymore.<br /><br />Loose Joints - The Joints, esply the arms, torso and hips, always pop out whenever you try to move him around but this is not a big complain, as to me this is just a part where you will get irritated for awhile but once you get used to it, you will never stop posing him around, like I did :D<br /><br />No Batarangs - Well, it is what it is.<br /><br />No wire in the Cloth Cape - Another \\"not a big complain\\" as this is just something that could make it better, thats all. The cloth cape is a light material and you can pose him around with caped over or even take the stand and clip on the cape, make it look like wind blowing or just plain old sch, take a fan, small or big ones, and fan it on him while posing him ;)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Everything that is not mentioned ;)<br />This figure is just so awesome that I will never get tired of posing him around.<br />I spend hours taking photos of him, and I didnt even realised I took that long to do a simple photoshoot of him but yea, it happened ;P<br /><br />Overall :<br />To me, it could be better, yea true, must admit it but hell damn, this is much more better than those crappy Mattel Movie Masters.<br />If youre looking for an Awesome Dark Knight figure at 6\\" scale then this is the one to pick up.<br />If you have the Play Arts kai, I will recommend to pick this one up too as its similar in some ways but a smaller version with more likeness to the movie.<br />Batman fan or DC fans and of course, TDK Trilogy Fans have to pick this guy, one of my favourite figure of all time.<br /><br />Recommended for all Collectors!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I'm into book 2 now,  I really like the two young ones telling the stories.  I read all of Ric Riordan's
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is hell of complex... it really tests it brain with its complicated puzzles... it took me 20 minutes to beat it... I recommend it to people who are interested in puzzles...
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|This movie just didn't do it for me and I love fantasy films.  I actually got up and started doing other things.  Even my 11 year old put it aside for more interesting pursuits.  I'm glad I didn't pay the movie box price to see it.  At least renting with Amazon, you are only out a few dollars.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|I've been waiting for this album to come out, ever since hearing that terrible album, Hear in the Now Frontier.  Everything that Queensryche's done since Promised Land has really left me disappointed, and has utterly lacked the vital ingredients that made their early work so amazing, and what made Queensryche unique.<br /><br />Not so with this album!  With Tate gone, it's evident who was responsible for those miserable albums of the last 15 years.  Rich, melodic textures are found everywhere, as are soaring vocals.  The ballads are well done, emotional and deep, bringing to mind the maturity and progression of Promised Land mixed with the hooks of Empire, whereas the heavy songs are really heavy.  \\"Spore\\" conjures up the sci-fi paranoia of Rage for Order, whereas \\"Fallout\\" finds the band more metal than they have been since Mindcrime.  Awesome!<br /><br />Todd Latorre doesn't let me down one bit: he matches the former singer, and even raises the stakes a bit with some interesting phrasing and hooks.  The other guys are all on fire: Eddie Jackson's bass is up front and punishing.  Scott Rockenfield's drumming is spot on, with lots of frills and fills.  Michael Wilton...well, he rules, like he always has.  Even Parker Lungren fits seemlessly into place.<br /><br />The short length of the album makes it quite digestable, though an epic song like \\"Roads to Madness\\" would have been great; this way, however, it hits you straight on, doesn't let you go for 30 minutes, and every second reminds of why I love this band.
B00CFYD682|5.0|For those of you who have appreciated Alison since her years with Vince Clarke, this will be a treat. However, not just because of her return to \\"electronic music.\\" This is a truly brilliant album in that it captures the heart and soul of living and taking stock of one's life. This album truly breathes and I am delighted to say that after over dozens of listenings, it is still fresh and marvelous and truly powerful.<br /><br />The composition is inspired and the production matches the individual works flawlessly. But what makes this an exemplary album is that it is just that...an ALBUM. It is truly a collection of works that is greater than the sum of the individual tracks. It has meaning overall that transcends the songs themselves.<br /><br />As I have continued to listen to this work it feels like a journey and one that truly bears repeating. Like a joyous relationship, it just doesn't grow old.<br /><br />I cannot say enough wonderful things about this album. It is THAT good. Really. Of my collection of thousands of albums amassed over the years, this one joins an elite set that can (and really MUST) be played straight through from beginning to end. So many artists release a smattering of songs a few of which are worthy of repeated listening. However, a few have released outstanding albums that by the nature of the work prevent the listener from skipping over a track. This is most certainly once such album.<br /><br />And that voice...*shiver*...it's like velvet to the ears.<br /><br />Kudos Alison!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Take out zombie, put in viral infection... This was such a great read but so disturbing. We are just one infection away from destruction.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This may be Hosseini's best book, although I've also liked his first two.  You have to stay really  focused, reading this, as he has a clever way of introducing characters, with frequent flashbacks, featuring the various  characters, and it takes awhile to know who's speaking.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I must have watched this performance at least 10 times, so far.  It is stunning from the very first note. I have loved Les Miz for many years and this is THE performance to see. Jean Valjean is sung by Alfie Boe and he is magnificent!  His Bring Him Home has become the definitive version, IMO.  Be sure to watch the special guests after the performance.  There is a moment there called \\"The key change heard round the world\\" that is breathtaking. This was a special night for those in the audience and the excitement and electricity of the performances translates to the DVD
B002W1UEW4|2.0|I first saw this movie shortly after it came out on DVD. No seeing it for so long made me want to watch it again, but watching it again  I found myself bored by the action and plot. Action sequences are good looking but vapid.  The storyline didnt hold my attention as before.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Just start watching. I enjoy having them in Blu-Ray. Have not run into any issues with the quality of the DVD's. Packaging was fine and shipment was lightening fast.
1567184855|4.0|Interesting book about the process of death and rebirth from the perspective of past life regression hypnosis. Not for strongly religious folks...
044654146X|5.0|I am about half way through but wanted to rate it now. The only issue is that one of the highlights in the book just went bankrupt. Having said that the principles are still valid. I love the way the authors have laid out the book. I appreciate the way they delve in to the historical aspects to validate their story they are telling. I have recommended this book to several of my Christian friends and will be purchasing a couple of copies to send to friends.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its pretty fun. I wish I didn't have to do a review to gt something thought but I guess its fair.
B002PQ7JQK|2.0|Just started watching the episodes. They don't appear to be in order of the original series. The menu of available shows and what is where is just short of terrible, I am into the 2nd disk and already I have a failure of the disk in the 'Mudd' episode. It just freezes, and when you restart it, it does it again in the same spot. I hate to return things but I believe all disks need to actually work. I do love the ability to choose whether to watch the enhanced version or the original version.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|highly recommended by friends, and did not disappoint.  It takes a while to figure out who is who.  Reading some of the summaries of the plot and background on the internet helps.  Eventually it becomes clear anyway, but then, you might want to review some of the prior episodes to fill in the gaps.  A 5 min intro to the series on the first episode, and what is going on at its start would be very helpful.  A bit more nudity and homosexuality than I prefer--seemed not necessary for the story to be successful and was distracting.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Hard to fairly rate a singer who's sold so many copies, yet she has such a soulful, forceful, distinctive and emphatic voice.
B0051VH1EG|5.0|this book is great, it outlines all of the daily maintenance for curly hair routines,<br />whilst supplying recipes to make your own hair products....<br />love it.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|This is a great app for abstract designs, but it's also great for sketching.  This is by far my favorite drawing app so far.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I watched this movie with my family. My daughter, who is 8, refused to go to sleep until it was over. We enjoyed the experience.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is the best show ever. The 16 episodes are great and there is bounus tracks and deleted scenes. I am very pleased with this dvd set and can not wait for season 3 to come out.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I was nervous about buying this director's cut of the movie because of so many empassioned 1-star reviews saying how the new comic book style additions 'destroyed a classic.' I needn't have worried. The movie is 98% what is was in the original, with a few additional tweaks of comic book style freezes, the new intro, and the freeze at the end. If they would have put both this version and the untouched original on the same DVD, a lot of grumping could have been avoided. But given the changes, this is still the best verion of the film on DVD that I could find. I love the interviews with the actors - aren't you curious how everyone looks nearly 30 years later? The extras to me do not disappoint. You Warriors are good. Real good.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I love escape-the-room games. I liked this one, but I wish it had more levels. I finished it pretty quickly.
0307719774|5.0|Easy-to-answer, short-response questions that you can fill in at your leisure. Yes, it is supposed to be filled in everyday, however, when I've missed some I just enter the current date and catch up. Very fun to read through answers from even the past couple weeks. It's like reading a book you wrote to yourself. Breadth of questions really capture how you felt and lived on particular days.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|My dear brother-in-law got me hooked on Game of Thrones and I haven't looked back.  The books are rich with adventure, drama, and more deceit than I can keep up with.  Plus now I get to tease my brother-in-law about tid-bits of upcoming plots since I've read the five books George R.R. Martin has released.  I am looking forward to the next releases!!
B00001PE4D|4.0|Really good &#34;you deserve it&#34; kind of movie. Love the twist the movie takes you on. The ending is superb, and she deserves what happens. Hate that &#34;someone&#34; had to die, but it leads you on a wonderful movie ride.
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt's recalling of his childhood reflect the acceptance of the Irish of that era to  their situation.  The poverty,discomfort,lack of fundamental medical care seems to be so prevalent that the  entire community sees it as normal.  The devil may care attitude of the children conveys a sadness that is overwhelming.  The death of siblings  affects the mother and father in very different ways.  There is a pervasive fatalism among them that seems to preclude their expecting or working toward a different way of life.  The father's denial of reality,his living in the pathos of the downtrodden Irish describes the attitude of the characters in general. Overall, I found the book to be both sad and humorous.  I would highly recommend it,  We  (Book Club) used it  for a monthy meeting and it led to much discussion.  Sandra B. Taylor
0316228532|5.0|I grew up with the HP series and didn't really know what to expect from J.K. Rowling's adult novel, so I dilly-dallied and only yesterday finally sat down to read a copy a friend had loaned me.<br /><br />I could not put the book down.<br /><br />It was like the Harry Potter reading marathons from my childhood; my only pauses were for food and bathroom breaks.<br /><br />That being said, this novel is certainly nothing like the HP books, where the driving force of the story was its thrilling plot.  In 'The Casual Vacancy' the premise is deliberately mundane, which serves to emphasize Rowling's unflinchingly honest character studies.  She painstakingly, and often painfully, deconstructs her characters' motivations, both noble and ignoble.  Though I felt more sympathetic to some characters than others, no one was spared from scrutiny.  She gave enough details to form impressions, but left enough to the imagination that readers could form their own opinions and sympathies.  This was not a light read, and required both intellectual and emotional energy and flexibility.  There were no true heroes, and at times the study became bleak and jaded.  However, it was refreshingly realistic, not to mention beautifully and expertly done.  I felt like my outlook on life was positively impacted by the book.  It should be added to the list of contemporary classics.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am new to the series, actually saw the first two on TV, and started with the third.  NO problem, I still had a hell of a time, and am already reading the fourth installment
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This could NOT have been casted better, the guy who plays Hannibal is brilliant! A serious genius and predator. Id you like the movies like I did, this blows them away! Watch this series, and Lawrence Fishbourne plays Jack Crawford not only correctly but with intent! The only thing that concerns me is they are moving to fast, I want this show too drag on for a few seasons! I have never seen anything like it, another new favorite for me. Also, watch Bates motel on A&E, it's not quite as jaw dropping but it is good.
0756405890|4.0|I like this book. It was easy to read, and especially a couple of hundred pages in, difficult to put down. The main character, Kvothe, as others have noted - he's arrogant. So much so that he ends up making his own troubles for himself when he runs into other people. The language is very nearly ponderous, but does *almost* reach a Tolkien-level of flow. If it weren't for that very heavy bit of almost, this book would get five stars.
1932100660|5.0|This is a great book to read I haven't finish yet because I keep going over certain sections. It is really opening up my eyes about food and the damage we are doing to our body. If we can cut down on the animal fat maybe there will be a big change in  our life. Gooooood book
B007N8RULO|4.0|This game is good for keeping your mind sharp. It is easy to play &amp; you can build your skill.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Love soft waves mixed with seagulls, I fall asleep in limited and love waking up to it as it plays all night.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|This is an essential part of any Whovian's collection.  The adventures of the 11th Doctor (Matt Smith) and the Ponds through time and space.  River Song shows up from time to time but I can't give to much of that away.  As she would say...spoilers.  These complete series sets are worth the price.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Have always loved watching this movie, love to throw it on for a rainy day.  Probably never get bored of watching this one!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed this game.  Definitely needs more levels because I was sad when it was over.  Didn't want to put it down.  Makes you think!
B00005R23S|5.0|How did I get here.  I heard this guy's music here and there for years and really didn't pay attention.  I was more of a jazz fan - Miles Davis was the man.  I'm a big fan of author Nick Hornby and he mentions a lot of artists in his books that I love.  I kept seeing Springsteen come up.  I had also read about that little informal competition between Springsteen and The Clash so that also got me interested.  As a musician I love listening to live performances so I came to Amazon and saw all the great reviews for the Live in New York City CD set.  I bought that, then went on a Springsteen binge (somebody save me!) and decided I had to see these performances as I kept reading how great they are visually.  I'm glad I purchased this!  These guys have so much love for one another and the audience, they really do bring it full on.  The performances on the DVD are in some cases different than those on the CD which is great.  Love it and highly recommend it.  Now I gotta by London Calling Live From Hyde Park.
B00886XQO0|4.0|There a good headset but they do have there<br />cons:<br />1. Sometimes the people that are talking they will cut out and in<br />2. The headset sometimes just shuts off when you talking it has a timeout.<br />3. I have to charge it with the play and charge & technically its not wireless when you have to do that.<br />&<br />Pros:<br />1. I like how I'm free to walk around.<br />2. It's got a good distance on keeping connection<br />3. Sounds good with game volume<br />4. It can last almost two good night of play time when fully charged.<br /><br />Overall it's a good headset.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty realistic! I wish we could chat with other people though,that would be even better. Handbooks handedness Hendricks kinsman nameless
B00028HBKM|4.0|I liked the movie.  It was so impressed it made me realize how much Christ suffered for me.<br />Very good acting.  A must have in your collection.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I liked the game but could not find a way to play solo, without going online and using the internet.  Sometimes I like to just play alone and not against someone else.  I liked the things you could do differently...bigger bombs, aligning your shots, etc.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Lots of blood and guts, just what I was looking for, action is continous and pretty fast, can watch it over and over
B0089XH38M|5.0|What can I say except this is a great antivirus check and also free!! Thanks AVG!! You are number one!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This is an autobiography by Tina Fey and it's very funny. I laughed out loud on page 1 and never stopped. Maybe I liked it because I'm of the same generation as Ms. Fey so I naturally \\"get\\" all her jokes, from \\"The Love Boat\\" to maxi-pads. Or maybe I liked it because I enjoyed all the background info about SNL and 30 Rock. But I think I mostly liked it because Ms. Fey's irreverence and ability to hone in on the humor of women simply makes me laugh. And for that I thank Ms. Fey immensely!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am a little disappointed the way this series ended.  I waited months for this to come out only to be left hanging AGAIN.  I must say I have enjoyed this series very much!  Well written and steamy chemistry between the characters.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've read several books regarding NDE's. this is unique in that it addresses the subject from a scientific point of view.<br /><br />I found the book very interesting. I'm glad that I discovered it.
B0058M94M0|3.0|get the book about TONY IOMMI  it will tell u about all the  books in the world will tell you about the whole band IOMMI was the leader of the pack an STILL IS, MY ROCKING FRIENDS !!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large, easy to use 'keys' on the display takes advantage of the Kindle' s well-lit screen. BEST FEATURE: the history feature, which clears easily when finished.
0060989157|5.0|what an awesome book, THERE'S REALLY NOTHING ELSE TO SAY BUT THAT, AWESOME TOTALLY INDEPTH !!!!! you should buy this book if ur in to the rock scene
B008Y7DDBE|4.0|The movie is slow-paced and never becomes preachy, nor do the performances feel forced. If in the real world you have within a growing sense that things are just off and that something big is certain to change your, our, lives forever, and soon, and that it's best to quietly prepare, then this film speaks to that quiet sense of self-preservation. It seems many folks have lost that ability to trust themselves and their intuitions; accordingly, this film navigates that boundary between needing to feel normal in the face of overwhelming instinctual dread and wanting to save face. I can't describe it any better because it (the film's thesis) spoke to me in indescribable ways. It will mean something different to different people. It's worth seeing once for the strong character acting, but to watch it again would spoil the effect.
B00C4XYEBW|4.0|doesn't matter if I put this band down or not it not like it used to be!!! an nothing ever is, they made their money in the years prior, just an ok old TIMER BAND VIEDO.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I like the game. Helps beat the heat and is challenging without being silly. Played some that had no common sense. This one is fun and I usually do not like the escape games!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed the whole concept of the story. I think she needed a much better editor. Some words are much to complex for an erotic story. It's not a high school text book were dealing with here. I loved the first few sex scenes in the first book but the same adjectives are used over and over and over again; with a lip biting here and a lip biting there (or should I say Down There...) Over all I say it's an interesting read with much more potential if the right people were involved. Good for the writer on her success with the series. After all I was the fool who spent my hard earned money on her. Hope she puts more thought and effort in her next book or at least discovers the wide world of sexual adjectives and anatomy for that matter. Good for a cheap thrill..
B0059WTMLW|5.0|We have had some issues with the very easy ones!  LOL  So I can only imagine what's in store for the other levels.
1401232590|5.0|where can I start with this one it is only one of the best Batman stories ever it belongs with the ranks of The Dark Knight Returns and Batman year one both by Frank Miller  the story has to do with Batman Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent trying to bring down the Falcone crime family when a serial killer strikes killing members of the Falcon crime family starting on Halloween and straits on every holiday  it has a great suspense full story you will be kept guessing as to who holiday is Joseph leb and tim  sale have wrote a masterpiece whether you're a fan of Batman or just a fan of comic books in general you will not go wrong with Batman the long Halloween it also has awesome gritty artwork with great plays on contrast in some panels and any fan of The Dark Knight trilogy by Christopher Nolan we'll how this book heavily influenced The Dark Knight trilogy  all in all you can't go wrong with this book  this one will go down as one of the greatest graphic novels ever Batman the long Halloween is one of the five greatest Batman stories ever
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This was more a children book...it was well written...  Some places it was hard to understand...  A good book but not a great one..
B000FC12ZA|3.0|This book was a book club selection.  It is a very different book that lends itself to much thought and discussion.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love noah wylie..I like the characters.  The cast assembly works well together.  Cant wait to see the next season.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Possibly the best superhero movie I've ever seen.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a superhero fan.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|On of the best games I have on my kindle. If you love horses then this is the game<br />for you.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It so awesome. It is the most realistic out there. It leaves in the dust. I am totally impressed. I mean it!
1936891026|2.0|I was disappointed in this book when the author started rambling on and on about God and angels and mystical weirdness.  And I mean on and on...  I gave this book 2 stars for the few good tidbits on overcoming resistance.
B005LAII80|5.0|Great concept. Good action and effects. Fun to watch, and the story line I liked. I didn't know what to expect and kept wanting more.
1781162646|5.0|This is Stephen King at his best, without the horror, but with all the suspense.  AND it is shorter than anything but his short stories,  If you are a fan, you will love this.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Some people have said this game isn't worth 5 stars.  Well, it's not to be compared to Halo or even other psp type of games... but for a free game, it's by far one of the better ones.  It has the perfect balance of challenge and progression.  You are able to be successful without getting bored OR too frustrated.  You can be successful whether or not you use real money to progress.  So, it is a 5 star game for being what it is.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|My Mother loves the music and she had recorded a VCR tape of the show..  She would watch it and would make me watch this poor quality tape.  Finally I had just had to buy her a real DVD and she is happy and I am even happier!
B003VANOFY|1.0|I got this headset as a gift and it worked great for the first couple weeks. The sound quality seemed a bit more tinny than I was used to even though I had previously been using a lower quality Plantronics fake-surround-sound headset.<br /><br />My first experience with the headset involved a lot of annoying distortions and crackling noises regardless of what I was doing. For example, if I would turn my character around in game, the headset would crackle as the surround sound adapted to my situation. Switching USB ports eventually solved this issue, despite the fact that I switched from a USB 3.0 port to a USB 2.0 port.<br /><br />The headset regularly disconnects and reconnects, constantly giving the Windows device-disconnected sound, anywhere from 5 times to until I restart the Logitech Gaming software.<br /><br />Speaking of which, the Logitech Gaming software is one of the major deal breakers when it comes to this headset. It will freeze constantly, leaving you unable to use the macro keys on the side of the headset (yes, they might seem useless but I set them up to transfer sound from my headset to my speakers and vice versa). Occasionally, the software won't even respond to a left or right click in the system tray, meaning you have to open the Task Manager and end the process there (ending the task simply makes the software hang), a process which casual computer users might not be aware of.<br /><br />At this point, I was already ready to return this software as even as a gift, I was unable to keep the headset for $85 of someone else's money.<br /><br />However, the headset wasn't yet done presenting me with new problems. The USB receiver gave out and no longer responds in any computer I test it with (Logitech Software installed or otherwise). If this were the only problem (and it had occurred a week later) I would be stuck dealing with Logitech's slow and unwieldy RMA process.<br /><br />All-in-all, the G930 is a structurally sound, beautiful looking and beautiful feeling device with absolutely no reliability whatsoever. It is priced well below other wireless surround sound headsets and apparently for good reason, it doesn't work.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Easy reader, lots of information on all the characters...took til the end of the book to figure out how all the information was connected
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It reminds me of Farmville under the sea. A little too advanced for my 3 year old but he likes to try and<br />help anyway!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun and addictive.  i think can you escape is way better than 100 floors.  more options to explore.
B004V9MU86|5.0|The use of language to paint a picture is an art - Markus has got it!<br /><br />Find a rainy day and plan nothing else, you wont be disappointed
B007WFR0QS|4.0|Nice CD well put together this singer has an amazing voice very pleasant to listen to and am enjoying the music
1475143389|5.0|very nice book, really enjoy it. Thank you for sharing this wisdom! FROM BRAZIL! I DONT WANT TO WRITE MORE
B0050CJNJ2|4.0|Awesome CD Lady Antelbellum at her best a beautiful collection of songs and love to listen to this wonderful music
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best! Matter in fact it would be even better if they add minecraft pe multiplayer app and make mini games!
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Makes me want to see Psycho again.  Thought Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren were great as the Hitchcock's. It's a shame that Hitchcock never received an Oscar.  It was a complicated man, but a genius.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|At least as good as MI1. Certainly better than the mess that was MI2. Stronger theme and ending than MI3.  Worth a view.
B00009TB5G|5.0|now that i have all three i can watch these over and over again... the quality is so good and the extended scenes are really great.
B00008S7KC|1.0|Would love to review the product but even though it states on the box it's formated for regions 1,2,3,4, etc and yet I am unable to play it on my Blu-Ray player, which is less than a year old.<br /><br />I would have prefered the Merchant had disclosed this in his description.
0241955025|5.0|My first venture into a Michael Lewis financial analysis book. Who would have thought it would be entertaining? He finds the quirky corners of a complex story and does a great job of distilling key aspects of a global financial meltdown into a comprehensible answer to the main question -- wtf happened here? And why should I care?<br /><br />btw: To Mr Lewis, if he reads his reviews -- here's a bit of relevant news to your story that you might enjoy: From the BBC on 7/2/13 - \\"Duden, the equivalent of the Oxford English Dictionary in the UK, said it was reflecting the common use of the word \\"shitstorm\\" among Germans.\\"
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|I figured I'd give it a try and I was happy that I did. I sketched some interesting pieces and went to save one on high but the app crashed so I lost that one and I can't seem to get it to upload to Facebook to share but I'm not sure where the problem is with that. This app takes some getting used to so playing around with it helps with the learning process. Don't think this is a regular sketching app but think of it as another way to sketch and have fun with it. Well worth the download.
B00795P4EG|3.0|Really cant post a objective review cause the camera is way stupid. Please do not waste your money on this app.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I love everything Potterish about it, whether it be movies books or trivia quizzes. I also wish Hermione was my sister.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It's a relaxing game that only takes a few minutes to play if that's all the time you have. however , I wish you didn't have to connect to the Internet in order to play. Right now it won't connect to the server so it can't be played.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Mystery Manor is a fun and relaxing game that works very well on the Kindle Fire 1st gen.  I took one star off because I was &quot;forced&quot; to rate the game before I had a chance to really play.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|Although I enjoyed this game, I prefer games that don't automatically time you out.  My preference would be the game of Jewelry 2.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|In great shape and all played perfectly.  Purchasing was a good experience and I will do it again. Thank you!
B005SAP45I|4.0|It was as heartfelt as the original &#34;Cars&#34; and I liked seeing the underdog win!  Check this film out now!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Never read this book, I saw a little of the movie. Well i was so in love with this book i must read it again.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I'm glad I went back and watched this after seeing &#34;Monsters University&#34;.  It's a beautiful story and everyone will enjoy it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Hoped it had more levels though. It would have been more enjoyable if the levels were much harder. That would be awsome :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very good calculator. It is very easy to use. The numbers are large and you don't have to worry about touching the wrong keys. I'm an accountant so it comes in handy. Thanks
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game! You really have to take your time and use your brain. This clues are cleverly arranged around the room, it could be a certain color or the arrangement of certain objects. I love this game. It's not too hard or easy, but you must use your eyes and your mind. It's one of the most original and fun games in Amazon Apps. Get it and be your own James Bond as you find your way out of different rooms.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game ever since I got the updates since I tried to get it on the computer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first I wasn't sure if this was the book for me considering  I am used to reading just historical romance, but boy was I wrong. I wasn't really sure about the whole bdsm and the back and forth stuff between characters, and it kind of just left me hanging, hence the second book. I am glad I read it, it was stepping out of my boundaries and comfort zone and I admit I liked it. I would recommend it to others, and I look forward to reading the next two considering I am behind lol.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I downloaded this app thinking it might be a bit of fun every once in a while. I started playing, and I couldn't stop! It's hilarious to watch Ben get punched, slapped, and down flat annoyed! He eats, drinks, and even belches when you want him to. It's really funny to hear him echo your voice in his weird funny voice! I recommend this app to anyone who likes to have fun with a game without any real objective.<br />P.S. I love watching Ben drink the chemicals! Sometimes he blows up and blows smoke out of his ears and mouth. I LOVE this app!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Not enough Os in The Room to describe the experience in this wonderful game!<br />Very Must-y in its atmosphere. A very good challenge for your mind!
034580404X|5.0|These book I tell you u couldn't get enough of I wouldn't do anything but read until I got all three books done. If your reading this review BUY THE BOOKS NO QUESTIONS ASKED
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|My Grandson fell in love with Locked out of Heaven when performed on Saturday Night Live.  He is almost two and has all the moves and words down.  We take in the car when traveling and we all enjoy it.
034580404X|2.0|I bought this box set loving the 50 shades trilogy but when i got it the box it came in was ripped and the book pages were not in mint condition. I am the kind of person that is very particular with my books and now i don't even want them because there horrible
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Got hooked on this after hearing people talk about it. It really is a good show. It is a DVD, so there isn't much to say.<br />Timely delivery as expected.
B00A1AD6ZU|3.0|A pueblo is not a house, it's an American Indian village inhabited by one of the pueblo tribes, e.g. Tewa, Hopi, Isleta.  I live within the boundaries of a pueblo.  Navajo are not pueblo Indians.<br /><br />A Ruger Blackhawk is a single action revolver holding six .357 rounds in it's cylinder.  I own one.  You can not fire repeatedly by pulling the trigger, and, being a revolver it does not have a clip.  A Sig Sauer P226 is not a .357, it's a 9 mm.  Granted a 9 mm is the same diameter as a .357, but then so is a .38, as is a .380.  The difference is primarily in the weight of the bullet, the amount of powder in the case, and the .38 and .357 are both revolver rounds, the 9 mm and the .380 are for a pistol.  Also, the Sig must be cocked before firing; it's also a single action pistol that re-cocks the hammer when fired.<br /><br />Though mostly minor these errors make it difficult to read because I wonder what other factual errors made their way into the book.  Perhaps those additional errors affect the story?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Zombies are mindless, and as a general rule, I prefer my monsters to be more intelligent and active in their pursuit of evil. Zombies tend to lack basic malice. Driven by their endless hunger, they function as viruses with feet and teeth, spreading the contagion through bites and scratches. Of course, this makes them the a perfect repository for modern fears of pandemics. And of course, there is the very basic and primitive fear of being consumed. still, my expectations for the Walking Dead were not high.<br /><br />Happily, the excellent acting, writing, and movie-quality special effects both surprised and delighted me. The series is an ensemble piece, with fascinating and many-layered characters, and plotlines that deal with some of the basic questions that have haunted man over the millenia. You could remove the zombies and still be left with an excellent drama. However, I for one, have come to really enjoy those zombies. They are much more entertaining than I thought they would be--and a lot more addictive.<br /><br />I have now finished season III, after which I quickly circled back to catch up with Seasons 1 and II. Unfortunately, the fall is still many months off, and so I will have to wait for the start of Season IV! It is going to be a long summer!
B008JAGZDE|1.0|Okay, so I know this isn't meant to be a any great work of art, but does it have to be so stupid? The first one was funny. This was just stupid.
B00CBKLO52|3.0|I got this for my husband who builds and flies RC models.  He didn't think it was realistic enough but he really didn't spend much time with it.  He isn't very technically inclined:)
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This is a very refreshing film. Superman through the years has evolved with time for each generation. Superman is timeless. MAN OF STEEL is nothing less than I had expected. MAN OF STEEL is innovative and has not lost any of the originality for this generation of movie goers. The drama was very engaging and emotionally charged. I thought it was very good. It does not diminish the saga of the cinematic Superman, but only enhanced it for our times.<br /><br />A real standout was Christopher Meloni's performance as Colonel Nathan Hardy, Amir Mokri's brilliant cinematography and Hans Zimmer's powerful and emotionally charged score. Henry Cavill gave an interesting performance of Superman. Time will tell as these days re-inventing the wheel in the cinema seems to be in high gear ever since BATMAN BEGINS.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|A classic Hitchcock movie.  Excellent!  One of the best with a great Cary Grant performance.<br />A must see movie - timeless!
B009VL2B6U|5.0|Finally, we have a James Bond title song that sounds like a James Bond title song. It has been several years since we had a befitting James Bond title song. I was actually amazed by the depth and richness of this song and just surprised just how good Adele's voice is on it. Definitely, James Bond is back. It is unfortunate that Adele's title song is not included on Thomas Newman's SKYFALL soundtrack. Thomas Newman's score to SKYFALL definitely needs it! Adele's SKYFALL title song will undoubtedly earn its place along side the other classic Bond songs that have become part of that cinematic art form through the last 50 years.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|The TED Conferences are inspiring, compelling and empowering!<br /><br />Be sure to listen in as often as you can - these people will help you change and shape your universe!  Massively impressive!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game and love that it is free  but 10 levels is way to short.  Please bring out more floors soon!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it kept me wanting more. It is hard to put down. You never know what the next paragraph will bring. It is a must for those struggling with past abuse...somewhat of  road to moving forward and leaving the past behind. Thanks
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I really love racing games, and also boat/jet ski racing games. Riptide GP is a jet ski racing game made by Vector Unit, creators of other apps like [[ASIN:B006N0YWGY Shine Runner]]. The game's visuals are amazing by app standard, the controls are very nice, whether it's touch or tilt. There are 3 game modes: Race, for regular races; Hot Lap, where you try to beat your best time; Championship, which is pretty self explanatory. The are 6 jet skis in the game, which is a bit sad, because, since there are 6 racers (including yourself) it'll always be the same boats. There are 6 water raceways, also available on reverse. You can perform 7 different stunts to earn boost. The game has achievements, leader boards, bluetooth and USB gamepad support.<br />Overall, the controls are fluid, the AI is OK, the gameplay is real fun, the visuals are stunning, the music is quite cool, and the game is fair. I give Riptide GP a 5/5
B00BBA6FOI|4.0|it was a good read but i was surprised how short it was.<br />i think if you follow her speeches and read interviews she has done, you won't find too much more in here but nevertheless , i'm glad i read it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder should be required reading for every child going into the 5th grade.  Love the book & will share it  often.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Haven't finished this book yet but I'm absolutely LOVING IT! It's like getting to know the 'REAL' Sherlock Holmes all over again. I like 'Elementary' and the twist of Watson being a woman; also that it's set in New York but there really is something about an original.<br /><br />I've only come across one remake of a movie that I like a heap better than the original - 'The Man Who Knew Too Much'.  But then again - how can you possibly NOT love Jimmy Stewart!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My wife and I had read great reviews of &#34;Despicable Me&#34;, and it did not disappoint!  A very good film!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun and very entertaining. it also has very good graphics. um, so yeah. I like how its realistic. and the horses act real.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Like having the percentage shown...and very accurate so far!<br />The battery icon is nice too. Well worth having on display.
1592332803|5.0|This is my third vegan baking book. It is the only one that explains simply how to use egg substitutes, what different substitutes do in a recipe, and leaves me free to experiment with that knowledge. For that alone this is the best cookbook I have ever owned. Baking is usually such a mystery to me, but Colleen has broken it down so I know why I'm using the ingredients, and I can substitute appropriately. I've only made 2 recipes so far: the German Apple Cake (incredible, and has a fat free variation!) and Lemon Bars (my dad's favorite, which I haven't been able to make vegan until now). I can't wait to make more!<br /><br />I love this cookbook and recommend it for any baker, any experience level, vegan or not.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|An amazing record...Just got my copy  days back...There are no filler tracks on here (even the bonus tracks). This can easily be kept up there with their first four releases...Excuse me while I go listen to this majestic gem another time!<br /><br />I loved the album except it was WAY TOO COMPRESSED. Seriously it would have been less work to keep a nicer, wider dynamic range like classic Sabbath, and t would have sounded much better. The musicianship is pretty good too, although some songs drag out for a bit too long.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Super cute game, but the in app purchases are unbelievably over priced. The free content is a lot of fun though it just takes a while to earn new items.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I enjoyed the writing style, diary like. Both Nick and Amy's personality deficiencies were believable. Amy was totally detached and lacked any empathy. I have meet some self absorbed people like Amy so I found her manipulation believable. To a degree she was created by her parents.<br />The ending was chilling, I have found myself drifting back to the conclusion, Nicks knows!!
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Action packed movies. Never a boring moment. Glad I was able to find all three movies on blu-ray at such a great price.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|Harold's and Maureen's journeys were believable, denial and the unlikely search for contentment. What was believable was the void that long term relationships develop and the need to blame. I loved Harold because he asked for nothing all he wanted was to take ownership of his past.
B008V59AF2|4.0|I mainly bought this CD for one song....Sledgehammer.  But I do like a few of the other songs.  Good music.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Hi<br />I am not great at writing reviews so all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed this book and that I have read a few more in this series and enjoyed everyone one of them
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Love Phil Collins.  He first came to my attention when I heard &#34;In the Air Tonight&#34; on Miami Vice. Some of my favorite Phil Collins songs are on this CD.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was disappointed in how this book turned out. I heard Charlaine Harris is writing another book to give some finality to the story. I know this book would be liked by a lot of my friends but I'm a completionist and I felt there were too many loose ends.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|OK, this one isn't the worst I've seen, by far, but it sure isn't among the best. It's too bad. I think the director is extremely talented. Premise is foolish. And, as with most so-so horror movies, the climax is over the top -- and in this case, silly, too.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Thought it would be bloody, gory and tough to read, but it was gripping and intense. Made you forget these people were killing each other to win a prize. Tough way to live, but fortunately it is fiction!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Great game I love it<br /><br />Great game overall a d I lived that fisheries swimming around and around. Overall I'd say it was great but my niece s would like it as well
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|We love Merlin:  The Series.  Colin Morgan brings the mythological hero to life.  We will surely miss this series.  I know all good things must come to an end, but this one could go on for many years in our books.
B0041KKYH4|5.0|Everything worked great! I couldn't find this item in any local store such as Walmart, Target or Shopko. My husband wanted this movie and I searched the stores for months looking for it. Amazon rescued me and my time.
0553582038|5.0|For followers of the series, of course you need to read this book.  But a couple things happened in the last three chapters that really threw me - I would not have anticipated ANY of it.  Now, I am barely able to contain myself when I hear people talking about the TV episodes, because I know what is coming and it is REALLY BIG.  I so want to spoil it for them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love puzzles and this game is great for passing time. well done. I cant wait for more rooms. I recommend this to anyone. really well done
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Based on the great cast this movie was boasting I thought it would be more.........something.  Marital issues are a touchy topic, and if you've ever been married then you can probably identify to some degree with the sensitive nature of the movie.  However, I never was really invested in the characters or the central issue.  I never felt much one way or the other.  It was good to watch, but not a movie I would want to watch again.
B005LAIIN0|2.0|Hollywood has decided to build a franchise around World War Z which on it's own is great, unfortunately this effort is both obvious and clumsy.  the good: zombies are fast, simple, hard to kill, insatiable, the story encompasses the world, it's epic, and why we are losing makes sense while adding the needed tension.... without a doubt they are a credible threat.  the bad: their is no introduction, the Zombie war just starts, ... everywhere at once, and to be clear this was totally unnecessary in a story that is going to span multiple films, especially when the source material laid it all out.... literally the book's best part is how the Zombie plaque spread... from their on the book gets weaker and weaker as it goes but with World War Z it doesn't even make use of the best elements of the book.  A hint of where it started using Brad Pitt as the guide, the growth of the threat through Brad Pitts eyes, how it's spread, the moment when it's realized this isn't going to be containable, the distracted institutions pre-occupied in their own affairs... their was a chance here to build a franchise from the ground up that would have been epic.  but alas we get none of that, one day the Zombies are everywhere and everyone is running or dying, an empty comment is made to explain how the Zombies got everywhere that could just as easily have been missed.  how did they suddenly get everywhere without being noticed?  it's not like Zombies are stealthy. Thursday all good, Friday the world is doomed.... c'mon, don't be so lazy.  the &#34;solution&#34; is agony incarnate and incredibly premature in a movie that is kicking off a franchise.  the discovery process, absolutely ridiculous!  I truly can't imagine how anyone thought the solution or the discovery was handled well.  while &#34;the WHO building&#34; was great, getting intimate with zombies undermines the menace of zombies.  WWZ by this point in the movie is growing boring which isn't so bad because instead of misleading the viewer into thinking the ending is open they decided to close it making the whole idea of a franchise pointless.  &#34;look mom, I'm not scared of Zombies anymore&#34;  could have been worse but not by much given the money invested. (and yes a simple change will allow them to pump out a dozen films if they so desire but after this one I won't care)
B002U3CCF6|4.0|Like  'Gone Girl' this is a fast paced, well plotted novel with interesting and original characters. For fans of ' Gone Girl' this one wont disappoint.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game because it really forces you to use your brain. My son enjoys the challenge too. I think this is a good game to help his brain slow down and think about your next move and remembering what you have seen.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I grew up reading the books, watching the movies and playing the games.  This movie completed my collection of he movies, I got it for a great price it shipped very quickly and arrived equally as quick.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|It's a feel-good story (forgiveness, redemption, new love) but portrays an inaccurate picture of bipolar disorder. It shows the manic phases but not the depressive. He's either off-the-wall and hurting people, or he's normal. This movie perpetuates the stigma that &#34;bipolar&#34; equates with &#34;explosive and dangerous&#34;. I don't think it promotes awareness in a good way.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The graphics were great as well as the storyline downloading was fast no freezing at all. The game says free until you get to the exciting part then it cuts off and ask for you to pay 4.99 to unlock full version almost like a trial run for all the games that has free. Its an ok price I tried bigfish games didn't have that many interesting selection for android like this one
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|A great read! From start to finish I was hooked. My only disappointment came when I finished the book and found out the second book won't be coming out till Nov......
B000002OMN|4.0|What can I say I like Meatloaf.  The album should of been the follow up to Bat Out Of Hell in the 70's
B0055MBQOM|3.0|I was only able to use this product for 2 weeks. The third time I asked it to calibrate it wouldn't allow me stating that the cover was not on. I contacted the company (including corporate) 4 times. After the first contact they asked for serial number, etc and I sent them the information 2 more times. Hearing nothing back from them I contacted corporate and I still have not heard anything from them. It was a waste of $150.<br /><br />I recommend staying away from this company. You'll be better off just taking the $150 and tossing it out of your window.<br /><br />7 July 2013<br />Finally heard back from the company and sending in to them so they can determine what's going wrong. Will update once I receive it back. It only took 3-4 emails to tech support, an email to corporate and a PM on FB.<br /><br />I never heard what was wrong with the hardware, however, they sent an entirely new device. Will give a little longer before I increase the rating any further. Upgraded to 3 stars

B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book was such an intense read. Especially being about such a dysfunctional relationship between a mother and daughter. The ending was very unpredictable and I couldn't put the book down. It's a book that can be finished in a day because you need to find out what is going to happen next.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|The game is great, however it still has issues. From time to time the screen won't show backgrounds and elements making it impossible to avoid obstacles.
B000002H6C|5.0|I use to be a huge Metallica fan.  This is the last great album.  Yeah, its long but never gets boring or tiring.  What happened to this great band.  everything from this album is amazing.  The songs are complex.<br /><br />Don't buy any albums past this one.  Metallica has been running on fumes for 2 decades.  I listened to this album again and forgot how great this band once was.  Stick with the 1st 4 Metallica albums only.

B000I186FW|3.0|There are some good parts to this movie but I always end up losing interest in it. Too preachy. And I think Evey's got a case of Stockholm Syndrome.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is the best bingo ever but upgrades for ipad n kindle comes out too late...so when they finally come a lot people are done moving to another room, probably new and we are still left behind.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|I have some of their others and this one rocks! It has a little bit different sound, perhaps more serious. But its a great addition to your boc and instrumental music collection.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I'm in love with this novel it only took me a couple hours to read because I couldn't put it down. I love how it has the young romance that most YA. novels have but it's still a bit realistic. definitely recommend to those who love John Green and other YA authors you won't regret it. the only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me because it wasn't one of those books you can read over and over again and still love it's a great one time read
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's tough to have a perfect ending to a 3 book series when you've grown so close to the characters which is why, even though I can't really think of a better one at this moment, I can't give this one 5 stars.  Still completely worth while to read though.  One of  my favorite series actually.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like this game it's really fun I wish it had a time limited on it but still it's really easy it's a fun game to waste some time.
B00CGUSRYI|4.0|Dark Moor already has a rich discography that spans across 8 albums, so you'd expect their latest album to be good. On one hand Ars Musica continues utilizing the bands neo classical roots, but on the other hand seems to head towards a more accesible album then their previous ones. Now I'm not saying this is a bad album, but it could've been better seeing as the songs are shorter, and lack alot of the epic qualities that were shown on their earlier works.<br /><br />If your into catchy Power metal with memorable chouses and epic music to go along with them then I'd check out this album. I had high expectations for this album, and when I listened to it in it's entirety I was highly disappointed at the direction they are starting to head towards.<br /><br />Highlights: Ars Musica (Intro), First Lance Of Spain, The Road Again, The City Of Peace, Living In A Nightmare<br /><br />Rating: 7.5/10

0425221806|5.0|I would read this novel again later.  I gave a 5 star because of the fantasy aspect and how the novel began.  It kept you in suspense and had a couple of themes going on.  It was a great read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a Great read! The suspense will keep you itching to find out what happens next. Great twist of events throughout the story, really puts you in another place and time. The romance was well initiated and clearly will continue to develop in the next two books. I'd suggest this book to anyone who enjoys suspense, action, romance.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I had to return this disc. At the time I was playing Freelancer and using a mouse. I broke my mouse and got this one. The keys are very easy to program.  But playing Freelancer with this mouse started to hurt my hand after a couple of minutes. I had to send it back. With all of the buttons on the mouse it would probably be difficult to make it smaller. Oh yeah, There is a light on the mouse and you can change the rate it pulses, kind of cool.<br />Update: There was nothing wrong with the mouse. It was very good. I appreciate that Anker took the mouse back without any hassle. Thank You, Anker

1400069289|5.0|The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg revived by interest in psychology again. I actually picked the book up, coincidentally, during my normal habit of checking the library stacks one more time before I leave the library. I vaguely remember the title, liked the book cover and was in the mood for change, so I got it.<br /><br />I am glad I read it.<br /><br />Duhigg's book made me re-evaulate what habits are and how they impact our lives on an individual and social level. As a recently former psychology undergraduate, I am familiar with the concept of habits- conditioning, association, Pavlov,etc. You name it and I probably wrote an essay on it. I learned quite a bit about essays, but nothing that really impacted me (practically speaking) like The Power of Habit. Like other consumer and pop psychology books, Duhigg takes complex psychological concepts and breaks them down. The key difference is in how. The Power of Habit breaks these lessons down through story, one of the most relatable ways to share and process information. These are not ordinary stories. These are stories about people that we know, Tony Dungy and Rosa Parks, Michael Phelps and William James. It's the explanation of their habits that were the story. Reading that truly gave me a new look at what I might be able to accomplish with my habits.<br /><br />Unlike other consumer psychology books, this book is not heavy on specific steps (except in the brief appendix), rather it details general ideas and steps and allows the reader to decide how and where to implement them. I had no problem with it that because the whole book was a lesson from begging to end.<br /><br />In short, if you are a looking for a psychology-oriented book with humanity that will inspire your actions, this book is for you.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|I came. Repeatedly. Read this or you'll be sorry and miss out on a great book. I repeat, I came repeatedly
0525478817|5.0|I am at a complete loss of words in regards to this review. This is one of those books that I picked up because all of my friends thought I was completely insane for not reading it. In truth, I didn't want to read it because I knew that I would bawl and I was completely unprepared to bawl. I'm the avid reader out of all of my friends and all of the non-readers read it so my nerdy reader friends ganged up on me and threatened to burn my books if I didn't read it. Naturally, I relented because my books are my babies and burning them would be like ripping out my soul. Not really, but you get what I mean. Am I beyond happy that I read this book? Definitely, and I plan on checking out numerous other stories by Mr. Green, but am I so worried about writing a cohesive review that I'm babbling and trying to distract you from the fact that I'm still tearing up thinking about this amazing literature masterpiece? A thousand times yes. So, forgive me if this review does not reach my normal standards. It's hard to review a book that leaves you speechless because there truly are no words to describe the feelings and emotions that it instilled in you.<br /><br />To begin, John Green has perfected the art of unique characterization and connectivity. I had no problem connecting with Augustus or Hazel which, I believe, is why this was probably one of the most rickety emotional roller coaster rides I've been on in a while. Hazel has this really caustic, dry sense of humor that I tend to greatly enjoy in characters. However, hers was made all the more interesting because it was exhibited in such a unique and dire situation. She made an otherwise serious and overwhelmingly emotional tale full of surprising laughter and occasional smiles. At least, that was the first two thirds of the book because the last third was a killer. However, I'll get into that later.<br /><br />Augustus Waters deserves his own praise. My favorite aspect of young adult leading men is flaws. I love the flawed ones because they're real, they're not these perfect men that are unattainable in reality. They're doubly perfect because of their flaws. Somewhere in the world, such a person could exist and walk among us. It's characters like this that make reading worth while and, in my opinion, Augustus Waters is one of these characters. Once a star basketball player, he had to get a limb amputated from his cancer. In remission, he lived a life of metaphors with a big heart under his overly-confident exterior. Despite his ability to be highly romantic, the boy in him shines through his love of zombie video games and novels, but this also gives way to his obsession with helping others and going out as a savior instead of a victim. I have unlimited respect for this boy who always puts others before himself. The boy who puts a cigarette between his lips signifying the ability to kill, but refusing to light it to show that he has the heart to beat it. This boy is perfect because of his complexity, uniqueness, faults, and drive. It's funny to think that when I first met him in the story I couldn't pinpoint if he was an arrogant character who was all too aware of his good-looks or if he was putting up a front. It was neither, he's a boy with unbelievable depth who just so happens to be aware of the fact that he is gorgeous (both inside and out). I would read the book just for him. This guy is full of so much love and the romance in this one is real. It's not a silly little teenage love story--this is one that deserves to have a place in the real world. This is one of the first love interests in a while who, to me, seems human.<br /><br />The perfect romance aside, this book has a very serious undercurrent because it is a cancer story. I know a lot of people claim it isn't, my friends did, but this truly is one. It's just different than the usual cancer story because John Green was brutally honest. We get the whole shebang--the worry about the family once their gone, the journey to death,accepting ones fate, low points where the pain is so immense that they want to die, and the acknowledgement of \\"cancer perks.\\" These perks aren't just having your one Wish granted from the Genie Foundation, but being given a license after failing your driving test three times with your prosthetic leg because you got your right food amputated and can't do anything with your left. This perk is the free trip to Disney or boarding the plane first. The things that people do for the sick people. This book is real, and that's what makes it all the more heartbreaking. Green's amazing writing skill easily allows us to be caught up in Augustus and Hazel's relationship, their easy banter and worry in the first 2/3 of the book that when things get real, you almost forget that you're reading a cancer story. ALMOST being the key word. It quickly becomes abundantly clear that the story you predicted from page one has been lurking beneath the surface and it will all eventually come to light through a flood of tears, a barrage of tissues, and an infinite number of pleas for change alongside several of the characters. It's hard to make me cry, and this book has me tearing up just thinking about it two hours after completion.<br /><br />With that in thought, I want to caution that if you have a family member with cancer, I wouldn't recommend this story. It's heartbreaking to those of us who are fortunate enough not to go through such struggles ourselves, it'll be so much more intense for you.<br /><br />This is not the story for those looking for a happy-go-lucky story. At times it may seem that way, but it is so much more. The tears and torment are so worth it because the tale is so perfectly weaved. I know many feel cheated by the ending because the beginning of the book was so happy, especially for a cancer story, but again, this is a cancer story. If this was a happy story it would be known as a story of survival instead of a cancer story. Thinking that a cancer story is entirely happy is like going into Shakespeare's famous tragedy Hamlet hoping that Hamlet survives. If it's a tragedy and the character's name is the title, he is clearly going to die, just as a cancer story is clearly not going to be the happiest tale alive though it could be used as a vehicle to deliver uplifting stories of survival, love, trust, and perseverance. I truly think that John Green managed that in this one.<br /><br />Between the drunk yet well written and respected Peter Van Houten, Augustus Waters, Hazel, the newly blind Isaac, the ball-less Peter and all parents in this novel you will discover a cast that is easy to remember for their diversity, message, and perfect characterization. Green has easily proven himself as a literary genius and I eagerly await his other novels. It's not easy to make me cry, and as twisted as it is, I look forward to the novels that such an author can produce because the ability to make readers feel such strong emotions is something to be respected, envied, and praised in the YA writing industry. Green's characters may fear oblivion on Earth, but such a thing is nothing he will ever experience after producing a story like this.<br /><br />THE FAULT IN OUR STARS deserves infinite stars.accepting ones fate, low points where the pain is so immense that they want to die, and the acknowledgement of \\"cancer perks.\\" These perks aren't just having your one Wish granted from the Genie Foundation, but being given a license after failing your driving test three times with your prosthetic leg because you got your right food amputated and can't do anything with your left.

1250007208|5.0|Holy cow, why did I wait so long to read this?! That is the only thought running through my mind now that I have finished this amazing retelling. Cinderella being my favorite Disney princess, I was slightly skeptical going into this one. When I first heard of it, I was worried that it had to the power totally ruin my favorite princess. However, after I saw amazing review after amazing review surface, I knew that I had to give this one a shot. While Cinderella will always be my number one, Cinder is now a very close number two (tied with Rapunzel from TANGLED).<br /><br />An amazing dystopian tale, this world is caught up with an impending war between those who live on Earth and those who live on the moon in a country referred to as Lunar. To take over Earth, the evil Queen has decided to marry Prince Kai, new emperor of the Commonwealth (which is pretty much Asia since the capital is New Beijing). And somehow, caught between it all, is a teenage cyborg named Cinder who is the most renowned mechanic in all of New Beijing.<br /><br />I'm going to make this review quick simply because I could gush about this tale for far too long. The characterization in this novel is superb. Cinder is an amazing heroine. Though slightly naive, she is respectable and easy to relate to. Her cyborg mechanisms are fascinating and I experienced tumultuous emotions alongside her as she slowly uncovered secrets about her past, the present, and her future. I also really enjoyed Prince Kai's characterization. He is determined to do what's right for the millions of people that look to him for guidance, but he can't help the fact that he is still young and yearning to experience love. With heroes with true hearts of golds to vile villains with an insatiable thirst for world domination, the characterization is spot on.<br /><br />Though the plot is somewhat predictable because we all know the tale of Cinderella, I was still thrown by many plot twists. They had me skimming at a lightning speed to see what would happen next. And that ending! Though I have a feeling a fairytale will occur somewhere later in the Lunar Chronicles, I need SCARLET now to stop my now insatiable hunger for Meyer's writing. This is a must read for those who still cling to their childhoods like myself, but any dystopian lover, sci-fi lover, and fantasy lover can easily find themselves pleased with this one. Meyer is a forced to be reckoned with in the world of young adult literature that has me eagerly awaiting anything else she has in store for us.see what would happen next. And that ending!

0525423281|4.0|Stephanie Perkins does it again! She has managed to blow me away with a love story so achingly sweet and amazing that nothing can compare! Well, that's sort of a lie. ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS will always be number one, and while this book is amazingly written and awesome, it will always remain second to Perkins' amazing debut.<br /><br />The concept in this one was really great. Lola is a 17 year old girl dating a 22 year old rocker named Max. Max really only likes Lola when she dresses up and looks older, not when she looks like herself. And he's rather mean, too. But Lola's set in the firm belief that Max is the one because she loves him, so they keep on chugging along despite her parents disapproval, but then the Bell family moves back in next door and her entire world is turned upside down because of one amazingly tall boy: Cricket Bell.<br /><br />The family dynamic in this one was fascinating. See, Lola has two father's. Yes, two father's. And I love her little rants about how neither is the woman in the relationship because they're both gay--meaning they're both equally manly with equally feminine and male habits like loving figure skating and baking pies, but going on mean bug killing streaks while they change the pipes. Two fathers is really a win-win. Her mother had her as a teenager when she ran away and got into drugs and alcohol, so her uncle, Nathan, took her in with his boyfriend, Andy, who eventually took Nathan's last name to create one big happy, colorful family. I love it. Really.<br /><br />And of course...the characterization was awesome as well. Cricket was this glorified inventor. Descended from Alexander Graham Bell, inventing is in his blood and always will be. He's insanely smart, creative, awesome, and stylish with his purposely short pin-stripe pants to reveal his crazy socks and pointed shoes. His sister, Calliope, is sort of mean, but she's doing it to protect her brother, which is incredibly understandable in the end. And then there's Lola. Lola is the most fashionably creative character I've ever met. She's always in costume, but she's not pretending to be someone else. Costumes, you see, are just a part of her and they exemplify her need for fashion. However, Lola was slightly selfish at times, and that's what makes her incomparable to Anna. Lola lies a lot and made some really bad decisions that lacked immense common sense. She was blind to anything that she didn't agree with and she was always looking for her older boyfriend to respect her age, but it's hard to respect a teenager when they do, at times, act like an immature teenager. I wish that she was less selfish. She has a big heart, but a lot of her actions and thoughts were incredibly misguided. This led to a lot of fighting or whining in the plot that did begin to get old after a while. Anna and St. Claire do make cameos in this one because Anna happens to be Lola's supervisor at the theater and I'm glad to report that they haven't changed. Anna is still amazing and Etienne is still a tiny man with a loud mouth full of Briticisms and a huge heart. He, specifically, does play an important role in getting Lola and Cricket together.<br /><br />The romance in this one was slow going. There were a lot of complications and different obstacles hindering their path. But true love is eventually meant to be, and when a girl can give you the stars, you know you have to chase after her like there's no tomorrow. That's just what Cricket did...over the course of a little over 300 pages. While I enjoyed the pacing, I just wanted them to get together already! It took long enough. Sure, the final reunion was sweet, but I was really pulling for these two and their story seemed so unnecessarily complicated due to Lola's continuous lack of proper judgment.<br /><br />With all of that being said, I can't help but compare Lola's story to Anna's story, and I found several awesome comparisons because of this that only a reader of all of Perkins' novels can appreciate. While Etienne was so short, Cricket was monstrously tall with his monstrous legs (six foot four to be exact). Only a fan can appreciate this. Similarly, Lola experienced what St. Claire experienced about having someone they were committed to, but being drawn to someone they are so much more compatible with while in a relationship. It was interesting to see it from a female perspective, though a slightly younger one, and it makes me curious to see if this is a reoccurring theme in Perkins' novels or if book three will hold something different for us.<br /><br />This book comes in high recommendation, but I know some people had problems with ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS because of the many mentions of drinking and sex. LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR is a little worse in the sense that she has lost her virginity, though there clearly is nothing detailed, and her old neighbors used to have creepy life-size sculptures of some...unmentionable body parts. Pretty much, if you were at all uncomfortable with ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS, you should put off reading this one. If you loved book one as much as I did, then you need to pick this book up right now and prepare to be taken on yet another perfect journey of finding first love.

0142419400|5.0|There are no words to describe how much I loved this one. It lives up to the hype and literally warmed my heart. By the last word on the last page, I wanted to cry tears of joy for the characters simply because I loved it so much. Thank you, Krista, for sending this book my way.<br /><br />This book explores the wonders of what it's like to fall in love for the very first time. It was relatable, it was real, and it took me on the good type of an emotional roller coaster ride. Perkins found a way to put such a complex process full of unexplainable feelings into words. The romance was powerful, slow moving, and swoon-worthy. It took the entire book to develop from both characters denying their feelings to their struggles of coming to terms with the fact that they may be in love to actually finding ways of proclaiming their feelings. It's the entire process rolled into 372 pages that I never wanted to end, no matter how perfect the ending was in my eyes. This will definitely be my go-to cheerer-upper read in the future.<br /><br />The characterization was superb. All characters were three-dimensional and had a purpose. Even those meant to be hated were continuous in their rude behavior and not there simply to move the plot along. All characters were fleshed out and easy to love, especially Anna's crew of Etienne, Josh, Mer, and Rash. But Etienne St. Clair's characterization is what I love the most. He is American, English, and Parisian--the perfect combination, but his character is flawed. It's so rare to come across an imperfect boy, but Etienne is imperfect which is what makes him so perfect in my eyes. He's confused with what he wants to do with his future and college, he's short, he's impulsive and afraid to be alone, he has a sickening fear of heights, he is compulsively clean and polite, he always wears boots, he keeps sending Anna mixed signals in his attempt to be obvious about caring for her, he's such a complex character...but he is simply perfect for Anna. He is officially one of my favorite boys in all of young adult literature and I would read the book just for him and his Briticisms are pretty laugh-worthy too.<br /><br />I do want to throw a warning out there. As cute as this book is, parents may not feel comfortable allowing younger kids to read it. It contains the s-word, the f-bomb, f-bomb hand gestures from several countries, drinking, name calling, sexual references and innuendos, and a boy and a girl sharing a bed to sleep (literally just to sleep).

As cute as this book is, parents may not feel comfortable allowing younger kids to read it. It contains the s-word, the f-bomb, f-bomb hand gestures from several countries, drinking, name calling, sexual references and innuendos, and a boy and a girl sharing a bed to sleep (literally just to sleep).

B005NPLWYU|5.0|Not here to review the album's content, more the 45 RPM 2 LP set. I'm pretty happy with it. It's the best presentation of the album currently available, the actual LPs are very heavy-duty 180 gram discs, the artwork is pretty cool (though not as good as their previous three efforts in my opinion), and the sound is incredible. Buy it while you can!

B00915G6YE|5.0|While I think that the general character of the series has evolved / changed slightly, I still enjoy Dexter immensely. Season 7 is simply a continuation of the series with Dexter getting ever &#34;sloppier&#34; in carrying out his murderous actions. Without ruining the season for you, just know that Dexter inches toward getting discovered in this season. (Is that the inevitable end to the series? Dex getting caught?) Although I think that earlier seasons were &#34;better&#34; in some regards, season 7 is well worth your time of you are a Dexter fan.

B002ZG9846|4.0|Nicely done. I was completely entertained by this film. Surely not a classic and will be forgotten in ten years time, but I found the film to be quite fine, indeed. A bit of juvenile humor, some stupid moments, and a lot of fun.

0345803450|5.0|Readers familiar with Ian McEwan's style may feel after reading \\"Sweet Tooth\\", his latest novel, that he has mellowed greatly if not lost more than a bit of his usual flair. Though for my money there aren't many contemporary novelists writing in the same genre who can claim to be of his equal, \\"Sweet Tooth\\" just seems a little too tame at first, lacking the bite and trademark cruelty his pen regularly inflicts on his often unsympathetic subjects.<br /><br />His heroine, Serena Frome, is also a little dull, lacking in confidence and clearly needy, the cause of which is brilliantly captured - ever so dryly in typical McEwan fashion - in a brief but telling scene with her bishop father. Her duped lover, Tom Haley, isn't the victim of treachery he thinks he is but collateral damage in the situation Serena finds herself in. McEwan's mastery of quick deception remains intact - the callousness with which she is cast off by her Cambridge don lover proves to have a back story after all. And as Serena's relationship with Tom spins out of control then reaches the point of no return, you the reader will be turning the pages furiously anticipating the big twist, which when it comes, delivers as potent a punch as in his other great novels.<br /><br />There may be less violence and malice ostensibly in \\"Sweet Tooth\\" than in say, \\"Amsterdam\\" or \\"Saturday\\", but the denouement is as dark and twisty as one would expect from a McEwan novel. A great read.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I am going to stop getting apps from Amazon. Full stop. Its ludicrous. This app is sitting at version 1.2, I got a copy from the HumbleBundle that is 2.9.1 and the Play Store is at version 5.0! It has the Zen garden, mini games, and all the fun stuff missing from the PC release. The version on here still hasnt even gotten up to the patch where the visual quality is improved for tablets. It is quite noticeable going from one version to the other.<br /><br />Amazon having late updates, or (as in this apps case) completely abandoned apps, is not uncommon. I have bought my last app here. Its nice having access to the game easily on multiple Android devices, but you miss out on so much content it is simply absurd. I unquestionably say to you, if you are reading this, dont get your apps here. Get them through Play. And hey Amazon, get it together.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Beautifully told story, replete with intriguing characters and a setting that enlivens and enchants at every turn of the page.  We all wish for more magic in lives, and reading &#34;The Night Circus&#34; provides an ample supply.  Competition has never been so engaging, or glorious--each addition to the circus makes for an amazing immersion of the senses, even though the reader is only seeing words.  Expertly crafted story, and am looking forward to reading more more works by Ms. Morgenstern.

1449410243|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my sister but ended up reading the whole book before I wrapped it up. I though it was really funny and not a bad price considering how much there was in the book. I liked that it based some of its jokes on actual cat behavior (like kneading) so it was familiar for cat owners. Overall, funny book for a good price.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|My grand kids love this game.  Great for road trips and for keeping them happy while waiting to see the dentist, etc.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I really liked this book. It tied up some loose ends from the first book and then gave you even more to chew on. The only criticism I have, is that it's not a stand alone book. With the first book, you could read it, set it down and never pick up book two. However, with book two, the story didn't finish. It left me hanging. I hate that.<br /><br />Yeah, I've got book 3 to read, but if I didn't, I would be really irked. I read way too much to remember everything that happened in a story after months or even years. I would have felt ripped off, and even though I'm going to read book 3 in a few minutes, I still feel that way.<br /><br />I would have given this book 5 stars, but it didn't give me an ending that I crave.

B00BTHV05M|4.0|First half of the album has most of the radio friendly songs that you've come to expect from OneRepublic.  Second half of the album has the filler that appears on all of their other albums.  This album doesn't really rock like their second one does.  Pretty mellow stuff this time around.  Hope the next album lets loose a bit more.
B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt is a rather underappreciated album of the 90s, I think. Alice in Chains never reached the popularity of the bands they are lumped in with (Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam), perhaps because they didn't display as much pop sensibilities as those other bands. This is a very bleak record, no way around that. With only a few exceptions, the songs on here are heavy, sludgy, densely layered affairs. However, AiC has a very strong sense of melody, which for me is a large part of what makes this album so great; otherwise it might just turn into a wank-fest. No, Alice in Chains have that, and also a good sense of when to back off a bit; they break up the album with lighter and more accessible tracks to break up the sludge.<br /><br />So what about the songs?<br />I feel like most people who listen to this album only like certain tracks and don't understand the rest. They only want the catchiest or most aggressive; this makes me sad, as this album has a ridiculous number of really GREAT songs.<br />I won't review every song, there are 13 of them, but I'll talk about some of my favorites.<br /><br />Them Bones-a great opener, gets things moving and doesn't waste time. The opening ascending riff is killer, the vocal melodies are great, the lyrics bleak. It ends exactly when it needs to, clocking in at only two and a half minutes.<br />Dam That River-This is almost as good as the previous, great riff, love the angry lyrics. but the SOLO. and the vocal melodies. are just great.<br />Rain When I Die-This might be my favorite track on an album of favorite tracks. The opening vocals are killer (and are reapeated again at the end). This song is twice as long as the previous track, yet it never feels too long. With great verses, chorus, solo, this is just a perfect track.<br />Rooster--Another great track; accessible but still dark, with a glimmer of hope in the chorus<br />Dirt-People don't seem to 'get' this track, but I wish more people liked it. The chorus is very catchy and very heartfelt--\\"One who doesn't care, is one who shouldn't be\\". I didn't like it at first, but after multiple listens it really grew on me.<br />Hate to Feel-Another contender for favorite song-the chorus is phenomenal, I love the rhythm and spacing of it, with great lyrics, great solo, etc<br />Angry Chair-I love, among other things, the moodiness of the verses on this track, and the way the guitar matches the vocals on the 'Hey' of the chorus. Another great song.<br />Would?-this is another popular track, and for good reason. The verses are great, very melodic, and the chorus and lyrics very passionate. I really really appreciate this song coming at the end; it makes me really FEEL it, y'know? I've felt all the pain Layne has been through from listening to the album, and now he just lets it all out. \\"Have I run too far to get home?\\"<br /><br />Pros-all the stuff I've been mentioning; a huge number of great songs, with great guitar riffs, great song structuring, great lyrics...excellent sense of melody, dynamics, etc<br />Cons-the drumming is a bit weak; it's neither as powerful as Grohl's or as complex as Matt Cameron's. However, it gets the job done, and I like it a good bit on tracks like Angry Chair and Would? It just doesn't have a huge presence, like the bass.<br />Facts-at first I kind of didn't like the vocals, but they grew on me, like the album itself, and now I like Layne's voice a lot. Jerry does a good job on backup too<br /><br />I've listened to this album at least 100 times. Every listen is great, and I can't recommend this album highly enough. A fantastic album of the 90s and essential listening for any proclaimed hard rock fan.ery heartfelt--\\"One who doesn't care, is one who shouldn't be\\".

9380070195|2.0|--because it didn't make much sense to me.  I don't speak German. Some pictures or illustrations of the text may have helped. I think that the main character came off as a little bit racist, which put me off the whole story.  I really hope they don't make this into a movie or something, because it's self-indulgent.  Also, I hope this guy doesn't keep writing, because I'm not buying the next one.  He seems like the kind of dude who'd ask to use your cell phone in the bus station then get mad when you say no.

B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Wonderful dynamics, thoroughly enjoyable prose and his sentences are music for the soul. It is quite rare that an author with so many books behind him, all bestsellers, manages to stay on top of the game and never let his readers down one single bit. He has made the genre a work of art.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|A wonderful charming story that the whole family will enjoy and laugh.  I just recommend it is for older children. Especially because of the four/five scenes when the vampire father gets angry his face truly becomes scary and  gruesome.  Young children under 8 might find it too scary.

1401234550|5.0|I know that most folks see \\"DC Comics\\" and think one of two things: Superman or Batman.  And rightfully so, those guys built DC comics.  But for me, since reading the wonderful Emerald Dawn, when I hear DC Comics, I think Green Lantern.  More specifically I think Hal Jordan's Green Lantern.  There are several Green Lanterns on earth (4), but Hal is the one who makes the green look good.  For all his faults, he is and always will be THE hero.  They talk about boxers having heart, but they haven't seen heart until they've see Hal Jordan against the ropes.  And back in the day, no hero ever wore \\"going grey\\" better.<br /><br />When DC's New 52 reboot came in September 2011, I had hoped we'd get young Hal back and I'd get to see his early days again.  But in this case, Green Lantern is one of DC's instances of the \\"soft' reboot, meaning we're starting back at issue #1, but most of the character's previous history is still intact.  Or rather, the important bits.  Hal, John Stewart, Guy Gardener and Kyle Rainer are all still Green Lanterns of earth, Sinestro has been an enemy of the Green Lantern Corps for years, and the recent \\"Blackest Night\\" story is still intact.  So in the first collected story arc, \\"Sinestro\\", we pick up 5 years in, and Hal Jordan has been sent packing by the Guardians, the small blue aliens who created the Corps, and stripped of his power ring.<br /><br />Now he's back on earth, powerless, jobless, and on the verge of being homeless if he can't come up with three months rent immediately.<br /><br />Back on Oa, the Green Lantern homeworld, the Guardians are inviting the latest member into the Corps.  It just so happens to be Sinestro.  Do HUH?<br /><br />Hey, the ring picks who the ring picks.  Sinestro doesn't want the job either, but the Guardians aren't giving him much choice.  So Sinestro, the former Green Lantern who had turned against the Corps years ago and reigned terror over Green Lanterns, and Hal Jordan in particular, is back on the job.His first order of business is to travel to his homeworld of Korugar to see how things have been going in his absence.  Not well, apparently.  The yellow Sinestro Corps he had created to watch over his planet while he was gone has insured the safety of the people by becoming tyrants.  This just won't do.<br /><br />Sinestro turned against the Guardians because his idea of protecting his people didn't mesh with theirs, but this was definitely not what he had in mind.  He created the yellow power rings, but it's still an entire Corps against just him.  So Sinestro does the least expected thing ever.  He turns to Hal Jordan for help.<br /><br />Sinestro knows Hal is a hothead, not suited to the Corps, but he also knows Hal Jordan has, say it with me, heart.  And he won't stop until everyone on Korugar is safe.  So Sinestro offers Hal a proposition.  He gives Jordan a green power ring of his own making--created with the power in Sinestro's own ring, powered by it and with a built-in safety feature so it can't be used to attack its creator--and tells him if Jordan helps him on Korugar, Hal can keep the ring.<br /><br />At this point, life on earth isn't looking too great, and Hal is a sucker for an alien race in trouble.  He agrees and the two old foes set off to fight the deadliest army they've ever faced.<br /><br />This is, in my opinion, what super hero comics are all about.  And if Geoff Johns wanted to find some way to live outside of time so he had time to write every comic ever produced (aside from those written by Brian Michael Bendis) I'd be in a world of hurt, because I would want every one of them, every month.<br /><br />Johns's dialogue flows so naturally, slipping in some humor without forcing it, and letting the words from the characters inform their personalities.  He knows how to show even the strongest, most evil villains in a sympathetic light and BOY does he know his plot twists, cliffhangers and overall DUN DUN DUN moments.<br /><br />The art for the bulk of the story was by Doug Mahnke who knows how to depict an action sequence in the fewest number of panels while still including tons of action and energy.  His aliens are all unique and he's great with the surprising reveal that leaves the readers speechless.  Not to mention, his own skills at telling the story with no dialogue is spot on.  He can convey so much more in one silent panel than most artists can in a full dialogue-heavy page.<br /><br />I loved every page of this story and my only regret was in reading it too quickly and not savoring each panel like the nugget of gold it was.  These are the stories that make it hard to walk away from comics.  Johns's knowledge of his characters' history as well as what makes them tick, what makes them heroes or villains, and how best to portray those traits in words is incredible.  I've read a lot of comic book writers who are obviously very good at their job, but not many write like they love their job.  Geoff Johns loves what he does, and in this Green Lantern story, that love comes through on every page.<br /><br />More New 52 collections:<br />Action Comics Vol. 1: Superman and the Men of Steel: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NCVBFV1LW145<br />Animal Man Vol. 1: The Hunt: http://www.amazon.com/review/RC4SXOYJEHCN6<br />Aquaman Vol. 1: The Trench: http://www.amazon.com/review/RF8OL11X4GGUE<br />The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men Vol. 1: The God Particle: http://www.amazon.com/review/RE45TAKIVI8D<br />The Flash Vol. 1: Move Forward: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NPXW24NTPKJK<br />Frankenstein, Agent of S.H.A.D.E.: http://www.amazon.com/review/RTX5Z03GM3AZG

B009NG1Q96|4.0|This novel seemed to flesh out the world and it's troubles a little better than the Selection. The Selection was more of a novel about America and her ambivalence about her situation. A situation she put herself into. This book is more about what is happening in their world and because it never fully explains, I am interested in finishing the trilogy. I'm sure that is precisely the reason they don't fully explain. It was less of a love triangle book, and more of a novel about the world in which she, Aspen and the prince reside. America gets a little wishy-washy in this novel, being &#34;more&#34; in love with whichever boy she happens to be with at the time, and I don't know who I am pulling for. Maybe I want her to end up alone, just to prove to herself, more than anyone, that she can do it.

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|A number of other reviewers have pointed out that in the afterward Gaiman mentions that this was originally intended as a short story, and that those origins are transparent in the straight forward plot. I agree with them. Moreover, I'm still not sure that this \\"book\\" is long enough to be termed a novel and not a novella--it's a very quick read.<br /><br />Pros: The book is eloquently written, the setting is evocative and vivid (if not particularly exotic), and the main character is believably childish. More over, even though the setting is decades before my own childhood, it still evokes a sense of nostalgia for being a child. The book is quick, but enjoyable read.<br /><br />Cons: The problem was that the character wasn't really that likable, the plot was never exciting, the story was never surprising or thought provoking, and Gaiman brought nothing new to the table in how he treats the supernatural elements. Ursula feel too much like \\"Other Mother\\" from Coraline, and the Hempstocks feel like they could be the oldworld variation of the Norns from American Gods.<br /><br />It was a worth while read, but I feel that I would have been less disappointed if it had been marketed as a novella.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Superb portrayal of Lincoln and the matters he had to deal with in the final days of the civil war.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|I truly love this CD and DVD, and play them over and over.  I showed part of it to my Praise Team at church, and look forward to showing them the whole thing.  I hope they all buy it!  It is a great worship experience!
B0090SI460|5.0|My husband loves this movie so when it re-released in 3D I had to get it for him...he now loves it more.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|The game is challenging but not impossible to solve. Once I start it, I can't wait to get to the next level. Now I can't wait for the next version of the game!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Great movie. We loved the full 1080p HD quality. A classic that never gets old. I'm glad they were re-released.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It's nice to find a game that uses your mind and forces you to think. Not just a linear path. Have to make sensible choices to follow the path.
0439023483|5.0|The book arrived by the expected delivery date. In great condition and a great read. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wanted to read it.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|too much action and not enough good story line. Very disappointed as we loved all the other die hard movies
B001EN71CW|5.0|I backed into this series. I watched and fell in love with the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; and only then found out about the 'Firefly&#34; Series. This and the &#34;Serenity&#34; movie belong together in your collection!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|this wont install on my kindle, because it says that I need to delete more of my items to make data after I got ridden of all my previous items.  I have tried countless times over and over to download but it keeps saying that I need to keep on deleting. please fix this issue
B0053O89WY|5.0|Me, rate this product? I think it's a given...If you love this series then this is a must have for your collection!!!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|The CD is wonderful but the DVD is the greatest! You will love this set if you enjoy James Taylor and Carol King.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|My GF turned me on to this movie a couple months ago. She just couldn't stop raving about it. Since our tastes overlap in some areas and not so much in other areas, I was skeptical. The fact that I've watched it 6 times now and bought the BLU-Ray should be an indication that I like the movie...but that doesn't go far enough...THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE If there ever was one. Save your money and don't rent it...buy it for your collection folks!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is awesome and fun to play the levels it's very entertaining and each level gets harder which adds to the challenging yet fun factor. I played this game hen I was bored and it helped pass the time. It's nothing scary like in as some games. I like this app and can't wait for the new levels to come out! :)
B001UV4XIS|5.0|amazing movie!  love it !! and it has really great quality. absolutely love how this movie ended. couldnt have been better
1781162646|5.0|I loved the whole book!!!  It was a chiller from start to finish.  Classic Stephen King.  Great ending.  Keep up the good work!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|i absolutely love this movie. made me sad at the end, but it didnt make me dislike the movie. amazing!!
B00006ZXSK|4.0|I really love this movie.  I watched it when it came out on the big screen with my brother and really enjoyed it.<br />I wanted an affordable copy, and I think I got a good deal.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is challenging, addicting &amp; fun. A great way to relax or pass the time. Many different puzzles for many different challenge levels.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Is one of the best games I have seen in years. You beat the crap out of guys and fly around
0385342071|5.0|This book had me laughing out loud so many times, and although I could tell that a romance was coming a mile away, the novel became surprisingly moving as it neared its conclusion. By the end, I really loved the characters and their interaction. The writing was intelligent and clever in its use of texting and email intertwined with phone calls and in-person conversation. At no point was the sequence of events stretched beyond believability. I was cheering as I read the finale (that, yes, felt a little too Hollywood, but at least you could see logically how the characters had gotten into that situation). A great story very well told!
B003GK22HA|4.0|Has been a long time since I have read any Wilbur Smith. I enjoyd the other books from him. I am looking forward to reading the Egyitian saga - good pleasant read.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I'm not sure what it is, but I've been a big fan of the remakes. I grew up on the originals which were good at the time, \\"Evil Dead\\", \\"Total Recall\\", \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", \\"Friday the 13th\\" etc. But the remakes in my opinion totally blow them away. This movie is no exception. The story was A LOT more cohesive, and the effects were awesome. They weren't that classic 80's cheesy crap where you can actually see strings connected to objects flying through the air.. This sucker is a wonderfully done gore fest! I would recommend this over the original hands down, even though Bruce Campbell pulls off a one man show in the original that can't be duplicated. This remake certainly has it's scary moments here and there, but blood and guts would be the reason for seeing this one. It was all it was cracked up do be and then some. I'm holding out hope for even a more sicker sequel! LOL..
B008KWTF2O|5.0|Being 40 years old, I have: put up with, hated, charged revolt against  (flattened, straightened, cut short) my naturally curly hair.  This taught me how to care for it (to keep the curls as they are) and now, after 40 years, I can finally embrace my curls and not fight them.  This book was recommended to me by a hairdresser with naturally curly hair herself.  Thank you!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I downloaded this to read my email on my kindle fire Works quicker than previous app Love it Would recommend for your android
B00D3V85FA|5.0|You can't go wrong with buying something that is timeless.  If you live another 30 years, you'll still be enjoying this.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is so fun and anyone who likes animals will love it!!!!Its also easy to understand and you also learn about different animals as well. :)
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Don't care about any negative review on this.  Music is in the ear of the beholder, and I like what I hear.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|My wife discovered Lindsey by accident. It was the song Crystalize. My wife doesn't really like dubstep so this shows even more of how amazing Lindsey is.<br />  What an awesome album. I hope to hear more from her.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|The future looks a little grim these days, but this book provides perspective and tools to make things better. One of the few books I expect to actually use the advice of.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once I started watching it I was addicted! Can't wait for season 4. It depicts the aristocracy but you also see the servants side of life in the same household. Excellent story!
B00DF0POXA|1.0|According to wikipedia, KW stated, \\" With this album, we ain't drop no single to radio. We ain't got no NBA campaign, nothing like that. S***, we ain't even got no cover. We just made some real music.\\"[14] No singles were released from Yeezus prior to the album release date, with West remarking that \\"at this point, when I listen to radio, that ain't what I wanna be no more. \\"    Hmm, that is awfully judgmental for an album that is a little over a half-hour long and full of statements from other songs or tv shows that are then repeated over and over again to avoid filling those spaces with original cotent.  For example, in one song KW says, \\"f*** them other n*****, cause I'm down for my n*****\\" (from a C-Murder song) and then repeats it about four times (that's about 15 seconds of an already short album).  This album is far from what I would identify as \\"real music\\".  Instead, KW has taken typical content (sex and...oral sex) and added atypical beats and packaged it as \\"art\\".  And it's so disheartening when people define themselves by what everyone is doing. Everyone uses cd covers so KW decides that he's going to \\"different\\" and not use one.  That decision seems childish and attention-seeking. I would have much preferred an album cover if it would have meant better songs with stronger and less sporadic content. And if this is any indicator, which it was for me, the album ends with, \\"jerome's in the house so watch ya mouth\\", repeated twice.  A statement from the tv show, Martin, was repeated twice and used to conclude the album--- ridiculous.    Save your money-- this album is not worth your time.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|It's just so fun and a really cool app. I love it!!! Everyone says that it's not good but honestly it's amazin. I'm on it all the time. Super fun. MUST GET!!!!
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|It has it's cheesy moments but the story, towards the middle to end, gets better. So far kept up with the show on all seasons and I'm really liking the post apocalyptic alien war against the humans.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this  game is extremely fun &amp; really makes you think &amp; work for a solution...it is also relaxing and enjoyable
0596805527|5.0|You will understand the language in depth if you read this book.<br />The thorniest points are covered clearly and thoroughly. THE book to read.
B00198X0WC|5.0|This is just a great science fiction classic. A lot of the scientific principals discussed in the movie are actually true. Ed Harris is a superb addition to the wonderful cast.<br /><br />But, come on, lets get it done in Blu Ray!
B008J34466|5.0|Her voice is different than anyone else and her performances are always something worth waiting for. This album, inparticular, keeps playing over and over in your mind. Love it, and love her!
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|Donna is one of my favorite companions of the newer series, that's for sure. It was nice to have her back and see her interactions with the Doctor. She brings a lot of comedy and humanity to the show and I just love it to bits! The Doctor, as always, is fantastic.
B002716GU8|3.0|No intrusive musical number jammed in there somewhere, that has nothing to do with the story. You get a detailed period piece. There's one those Hollywood happy endings (well sort of). But there's enough mystery to hold your interest.
B00C0UHGLO|5.0|Challenging and that was on the beginner level. Definitely worth a download. I got it while free but would have paid for it.
B003O86FMW|3.0|(SPOILER ALERT) It was a good book, but I was hoping for something a little more original than another hunger games.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are pretty cool. The only thing that is not so cool; you have to beat the prior game before you can advance to the next one. Not a big deal unless you get stuck :)
0385537689|5.0|A must read.Take another fantastic journey with Christian and Anna. You won't be disappointed. A wonderful love story that let leaves you wanting more.
B006M4RN3U|3.0|I liked the song &#34;Tonight&#34;  the rest of the album isn't that interesting.  I can also relate to &#34;Some Nights&#34;.  I should modify that by adding that I am 65 yrs old.  It takes a while to get comfortable with things. This album has not affected me in any way.
0385537670|5.0|Great book awesome story line with greacharacter's. A hot steamy love story with a lot of hot sex. A must read.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Without giving anything away, I truly did not see the end coming...What a great film about determination, courage, and just how to cope, differently, with terrifying events...
0385537697|5.0|Loved this whole series.I put off reading this book for a few days because, l didn't  want Anna and Christian story to end.Kudos to  E L James.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I can't figure out how to 'search' in it. It appears it doesn't do what I need. If you just want to read it is probably ok.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is very entertaining and easy to follow. I can't wait to read the next in the series. It was a great choice for a summer read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My husband and I use this together as we read our daily devotion.  We read orally and also listen to the reading on my Kindle.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great movie. 3D is awesome. I purchased this product with the Panasonic Viera Active Shutter 3D Eyewear which was the perfect gift for my &#34;techy&#34; boyfriend.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love the fact that I can quickly check the weather at home or wherever I am traveling.  I refer to this app often.
B00867GKIK|5.0|I purchased as a gift for my boyfriend's daughter along with the Panasonic Viera Active Shutter 3D Eyewear. Great movie. Great 3D. She loves it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Make the time fly by trying to escape can't wait for them to add more rooms I was stuck for about three days till I figured out level 6
B004C6QCT6|5.0|Santana's 1981 classic. This CD has a lot of vibe. From 80's radio pop-style songs to classic Santana meditative hooks. As to be expected, the musicianship is exceptional with Carlos' signature on every piece. A must have addition to any Santana collection.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great graphics. Little expensive if you want to advance quick. Though worth it. You can lose hours playing this game!
B007URVZJ6|2.0|Here is what I liked:<br />The screen shots.<br />The reading level.<br />The style.<br />Here is what I did not like:<br />The structure of the presentation.
0062012339|4.0|I love the book, it's in my top 3 favorite books. Now with that being said I was a little disappointed in the condition that the book arrived in, it was dented and the case started fraying.
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|Easy to use.  Would be a good practice for younger writers.  When you really don't want to have to use a keyboard.
B003Z6WFWC|4.0|This was enlightening and i recommend it. Exceptional acting in a profound story about a subject I had never heard of.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Live the options it provides, captcha type alarm shutoffs and yet it's easy and simple to set up an alarm!
B0091THRCU|5.0|This is a terrific product.  It's sturdy, does a good job of protecting your phone from impact & weather, it looks great, and the price is very low.  The pull tab that you use to remove the phone from the sleeve can be a potential problem, though.  I had my case for 9 months and the slot for the pull tab tore open from repeated use.  However, I think it was caused by my pulling the tab straight out at a right angle from the case.  If you pull the tab up, parallel with the case you don't stress the tab slot and should avoid that problem.  When I notified Snugg of the case failure, they asked for a photo of the damage.  After I sent them the pic they promptly sent me out a replacement case.  Excellent customer service response.  I like this product.
B000002HRE|5.0|Why people hate this album I don't know this has a different Metallica sound but they were just growing and it shows how they can play anything and sound good still I say amazing album worth every penny
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Great production<br />Great cast<br />Incredible special effects<br />Not to over the top. I would recommend to get a better understanding of Star Trek as a beginner.  I was never a fan, but loved The Matrix, Blade Runner, and others. I wanted to see the new release of Star Trek, and a friend suggested I see this first.  Good call
B000JCETDS|5.0|This album is amazing in general its pretty much the soundtrack from the movie. The pick of destiny is awesome good for a collection. The poster is sick and bigger than I expected. The cards are cool to but I got to of the same cards which sucked but the album makes up for it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|My first Ken Follett book.  It is wonderful historical fiction which takes you into the real events of World War I and the Bolshevik revolution.  The characters are very interesting and likeable.  One of the best books I have ever read.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album is History! Its Metallica and the San Francisco Symphony and they rock I was expecting something soft for some reason probably cause its a damn symphony but it was just as heavy as all the songs on the original album. BUY IT!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Khaled has told us so many stories within this one book. Each, on it's own, beautiful and haunting.  He has woven together characters split over generations, opportunities and countries, yet they are all linked into this amazing novel that tells of courage, despair and the deepest familial love.  I adored this book.
B0000CE9VW|5.0|This best of album is awesome the CD really has all the Best hits of Pantera and I love all there songs but its the Greatest Hits so still cool. The DVD is mostly why I bought it I wanted all the music videos and some live video the Videos are all great and the live footage is way better than I expected good quality
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Gone Girl took me to some dark places.  Those clever and intricately woven tale stretches the imagination. Without giving away any plot, I can tell you that at different times you will despise the characters in this book.  You will also at times feel very sorry for them, and switch from favouring one to the other.  Trust me, read it and get taken for a ride..
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|I totally loved this movie.. From the actors to the concept... There needs to be more movies like this one
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I'm a big sabbath fan so I was not thrilled about bill ward not being on the album, I was very skeptical about the whole thing even though they had Rick ribbon producing and brad wilk from rage against the machine and audio salve on the drum kit. But I bought it and let the music do the talking, it the album is great! It's got the old sabbath vibe of the first 5 sabbath albums with a modern sound. Tony's riffs are still there. Three or four amazing mind blowing riffs sometimes in the same song. Ozzy hasn't sounded this good in ten years, even on his solo stuff which I love also. Just the vibe, music, lyrics are all sabbath quality. I must have by and sabbath, metal, rock, hard rock, or classic rock fan. A amazing comeback and album!
B006K1IIHA|1.0|The product is fine.  But no where does it say that this is a region 2 disk set.<br /><br />So do not buy this if you live in North America.  It will not play on your bluray players! This is region locked to UK bluray players.<br /><br />Nothing against sellers or this actual show though.  Those are great.  Just a warning for anyone looking to buy this.
B000000OUE|5.0|I absolutely love rob zombie and his music and movies. He's such a creative dude! That being said the 90s just had a cool vibe with metal and rock music then to me. Just so much creativity going then and originality that just isn't in rock and metal now a days. White zombie were diffentley one of those more creative bands in the 90s sort of hitting their creative peak and sadly making their last album in 95. But they went out on a high note. I love their sound sort of a vibe of 70s kiss and Alice cooper sort of showman ship, while mixing the groove and thrash metal of bands like pantera, Metallica, megadeth, on top that industrial metal of bands like nine inch nails, ministry, and horror movie sound bites in the mix making it a techno thrash metal opus worth listening to over and over again. I love zombies solo stuff and the first white zombie album but they don't have the metal magic capture on this amazing album.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|hours of cute Entertainment, a must have for childrenthank you for the cute kitty,we named her Sallie Maefun fun fun
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I am glad the triology had a happy ending although it was a little sappy.  I am curious to see how they make a movie out of the 50 Shades of Grey books
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is epic. It's a lil similar to temple run. You fly fast and collect stark credits and get XP to get more armour, better weapons,  more HP, and more tags k in your special  to make it even more awesome. It makes it like you are almost in the actual game and you can use gryo controls or tap and drag controls! You cannot simply &quot;hate&quot; or &quot;not like&quot; the game! If you do, I will hunt you down to the ends of the Universe...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. I love that I feel like the horse is real and I am actually taking care of it.
B0012CJQY6|5.0|Watch it.....you won't turn it off. Gritty and violent. Micheal Chiklis plays the best good-bad cop of all time. Excellent series to keep and watch over.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Have watched Seasons 1, 2 and 3 via my Amazon Prime video privileges. I'm thrilled with the characters, acting, setting, stimulating and everchanging storyline, and for each 1 hour episode I'm totally immersed and living in the ongoing story.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|A prequel of sorts to the Alien/Aliens movies. The premise is interesting enough, that aliens had a presence on Earth in pre-history and cave painting evidence is found pointing humanity to a place in the stars. A team is sent - a business corporation's team though, which allows for some personality complications to develop. At least this is all I can offer to explain some of the screw-ups who begin to act like teenagers in a Slasher film. This does though point to how this particular film is constructed, a mix of horror and sci-fy. In this sense it is a lot closer to the first film in the franchise than the action packed second. There are a few very stomach turning scenes, so not one for small children or the faint hearted. These things said, there was material of interest. The exploration of where we came from has some thought provoking elements and there's a twist or two as well. A solid film overall but a bit too ponderous and self-important to be rated higher than 3 ½ stars.
B003RRY60S|3.0|This is the first Doctor Who story I've read, although I have been watching the show for awhile. The story was ok, but I just didn't like the writing style. I kept hearing the 11th doctor in my head even though it is supposed to be the 10th doctor - it just didn't sound like the way he talks.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love it but it glitches a lot and shuts down my kindle.... the survival is hard for a beginneer just start out on creative advice to start out on survival u have to destroy a tree
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I thought Pitch Perfect was going to be a cute, chick flick kind of movie. I dragged my boyfriend along to see it because I've seen my fair share of his movies, so he was due to go see one of mine. Both of us laughed so hard we cried in the movie theatre. I owned the digital copy the day it was released. Currently, we watch this movie once every two weeks or so. There are so many one line zingers that keep you laughing throughout the movie. The more I watch it, the funnier it gets because I notice new things as well. Guys, whatever kind of chick flick you think this movie is...give it a chance when your girl asks you to watch it with her. I haven't met a guy yet whose opinion was that this is a bad movie after they actually watched it all the way through.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|DragonVale is an addictive fun game that is easy to pick up for just a few moments when you have the time.

B00004WEJZ|5.0|Bond is up against SPECTRE, an organization determined to threaten and blackmail the world with nuclear weapons.  Bond meets up with a deadly SPECTRE agent named Fatima Blush, who tries to kill him in unexpected ways.  The key villain is Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer), who toys with bond as long as he thinks he's in control.  Brandauer is an outstanding Bond villain.  Sean Connery is excellent as Bond.  -Roger Weston, author of [[ASIN:B007DQ4B6I The Recruiter]]
B00280LYIM|5.0|it was a great book everything made sense and it was fun to read you end it like your want to know what happens next

B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is useful and nice. Its easy to use and it's simple to customize for your specific needs. I like it all lot and would recommend it to anyone.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I was disappointed when I read some of the reviews for this show. Citing lack of character progression and such. I actually think the character progression is going quite well. Floki is an AMAZING character.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love walking dead! I care about the characters. It's one of my favorite shows? Thank you for providing it.
0865478007|4.0|I'm over half way through this book and find it extremely worthwhile; concise, hard-hitting and easily understandable.<br /><br />My only nitpick, which I do not believe calls into question the book's credibility, is the author referencing the Allhat study of blood pressure medications as a good example of studying different medications' relative effectiveness.  Ironically, this study's conclusions have been harshly criticized and held up as example of how not to interpret data.  In this book, the author said it demonstrated that an existing, cheaper, diuretic was \\"much better\\" compared to another new drug (there actually were 2 other drugs used).  The study failed to highlight that the patients using the existing diuretic were 17% or 43% more likely to develop diabetes relative to the 2 other drugs used in the trial.  Not exactly \\"much better\\". Various other criticisms of this study can be found and I will not dwell on them.  However, if the author's point was that side by side studies are effective to highlight different outcomes, the Allhat study may be a good example, but just not with the outcome that the author described.
1451695195|5.0|It's easy enough for most of us to acknowledge a queen who says that she's believed in as many as six impossible things before breakfast - especially if she's relating this startling fact to a young girl who fell down a rabbit hole, most likely after ingesting a strange mushroom.  It's much more difficult, if not impossible, for us to accept flesh & blood people who relate strange, after-life NDE tales.  That's because most of the time we can easily dismiss their stories on any number of \\"reasonable\\" assumptions.  And even if we accept their good character and basic honesty, any number of \\"logical\\" reasons remain for dismissing such an impossible thing.  And, if \\"logic\\" still fails us, we can be certain that such a person simply doesn't have the knowledge to understand the physical ramifications of the human brain and the tricks it can play on personal consciousness.<br />  But Dr. Alexander's medical and scientific credentials dismiss those arguments, especially with the appendix evidence he so thoughtfully shares.  So . . . did he make up his amazing story for the fame and notoriety?  (Only if he wanted to inflict damage on a sterling career and professional standing!)  Or did he write it simply because some happenings simply MUST be shared, regardless of the consequences.  And that was it -- an occurrence that simply could not be ignored and swept under the rug.  Such experiences compel all of us to stand up with the realization that finally we know that reality goes where conscious goes.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I Loved it. The Secret, The Power and The Magic are all very interesting. Definitely A Must Read -  all three!
0061122416|4.0|Read original review @ The Indigo Quill: [...]<br /><br />  In honor of Paulo Coelho's latest edition of his book Manuscript Found in Accra, I decided to do a review on an oldie but a goodie. His work that started it all: The Alchemist. I finally read this book last year when it was a pick for a book club I was in at my church. I had heard about it and knew of a lot of people who just thought it was the best book ever. Did I find it to be the absolute best book I've ever read? No, not really. But I did find it very unique and inspiring.<br /><br />In The Alchemist, we travel on a journey with a boy named Santiago who leaves his home and so-called \\"destiny\\" of being a shepherd boy to search for an unknown treasure, his \\"Personal Legend.\\" Along the way, he comes into contact with people and situations that help or hinder them, but he perseveres nonetheless.<br /><br />There are a few things I would recommend a reader to be aware of before diving into this book: 1) This isn't necessarily a novel as it is an extended parable. Coelho writes in a way that is simple and to-the-point so don't expect a lot of \\"fluff.\\" 2) This book was originally written in Portuguese, not English. ....That's all I have to say about that. 3) Even though this book is written in simple-terms, there is an endless number of symbolism to keep an eye out for.<br /><br />That being said, the general intent of The Alchemist is to paint a picture of man's journey out of the mundane life to pursue his calling. There are many obstacles in the way, doubts that creep in, and even people who may be against you, but that doesn't make the things that you have set out to accomplish any less real or out of reach. It's a beautiful thing and that's what The Alchemist portrays. It leaves the reader thoughtful and hopefully even a little inspired.

B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love the game.  But I can't get it. On my kindle or my phone which really sucks. I got my friends playing it to they also have problems with tbe game
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Love this album even more than their last one.  Highly recommended!!!<br /><br />Other than Hollow and Stone, my favorite songs are Pretty Done and Phantom Limb.  I love the guitar tone/distortion that Cantrell uses - so heavy and intense, all the while balancing the melodies and flow.  Still my favorite band...<br /><br />I also just bought the new Soundgarden and Queens of the Stone Age and this is my favorite out of the three.<br /><br />Need more!!!<br /><br />This album is totally worth buying the CD version.  It sounds amazing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a roller coaster ride, read this for BOOK CLUB, the beginning is boring took sometime to get into this book it was well worth it. My gtoodness are there really people like this in the world that we know? This isw scary to me I hope not. Yes I encourage others to read
B00ATDOVNK|2.0|I started to get into the game then bam.....come to find out it was not a full game even though it said free. G5 needs to be accurate in the way they post their games. At least SAY this is not a full version. Other than that I liked the style of the game I would have rated it a 5 if they would have disclosed more information from the start.
B000N6U0EC|5.0|Great story and wonderful pictures.One of the most inspiring movies. Among the top of my list. Can watch it over and over without getting bored.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Loved this book, I will read everything and anything Tina Fey writes. I hope she is writing a new book right now.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|One of the best musicals of all time. Most of the new cast's voices did not live up to the previous cast of tenth anniversary, but it was still great to see a new version. If you have not owned the previous one, you may think that this is the best les Mis concert. However, the ensembles were a lot better than the previous cast. The only downside of this disc is Nick Jonas. He was uncomparable to Michael Ball, the original cast both in terms of expressing his feeling for Cosette and voices. However, all in all, I found it entertaining and refreshing. But after watching this cast, I had to go back to the previous one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game . I love playing this game . I . Wish it had a hint button but other then that it's great
B009YN2M7S|4.0|Enjoyed this book. Much of it was predictable, but the characters & storyline kept me coming back. The twist at the end was interesting.
B00CNEVHMG|1.0|Alas, I agree with the other 1 * reviews of the brand new SACD release that the sound quality just isn't there.  It gives the impression of being taken from a 2nd or 3rd generation tape source.  It lacks psychoacoustic force due to the blunting of all the edges.  What went wrong?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game.. its definitely something to occupy your mind.. can drive you crazy at times... makes you think.. I recommend it
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Kevin spacey is awesome as is the rest of the cast - not a bad actor in the cast.  Two thumbs up, for sure.
159463176X|5.0|This is a really great book on so many levels.  The writing is beautiful, evocative, and thoughtful; rarely, if ever, is it overwrought or boring.  The thing that makes this book really incredible, though, is not only the many interesting stories of the characters and their lives in Afghanistan, Greece, France, the United States, but also the way they are very carefully, purposefully woven together.  A few stories may seem slightly out of place as you go along, but they come together perfectly.  The story has both intellectual and emotional appeal for me - it is intelligently written and constructed and also heartwrenching, funny, profound, and intense at different turns.  It's also fascinating - I couldn't put it down.  All in all, one of the better books I've read in my life - and that's saying something, because I read a LOT.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've really grown to love the characters, though I've learned not to get too attached lots of twists and turns.
B008JFUQ3O|4.0|In the summer of 2010, Illumination Entertainment's animated flick, Despicable Me, decimated the box office, earning $543 million - not to mention garnering praise from fans and critics alike.  A family-friendly film, Despicable Me follows Gru, an evil super villain, as he adopts three girls with hopes of using them to one-up a rival super villain.  Instead, he falls into the role of devoted father, giving up on his evil ways.  Most notably, the film also introduces the Minions - Gru's short, yellow workers that speak gibberish and often find themselves engaging in an endless amount of comical hijinks.  Now, Gru and his Minions are back, along with Agnes, Edith, and Margo in the animated sequel, Despicable Me 2.<br /><br />Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud return to direct Despicable Me 2, which once again stars Steve Carrell as Gru - a now retired super-villain that's attempting to create his own brand of jelly.  At the same time, a mysterious villain has stolen a chemical recipe that can turn living things into indestructible purple killing machines.  Desperate to stop the mysterious villain, the Anti-Villain League (AVL) enlists Gru's help, pairing him with an AVL agent, Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wigg), to track down the villain and stop them before they unleash the recipe on the world.  The voices of Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaaier, Elsie Fisher, Ken Jeong, Russell Brand, and Benjamin Bratt also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />To be honest, I found Despicable Me to be so light-heartedly entertaining and enjoyable that's it's easily at the top of my animated feature list (just so you know that I'm being biased here).  With that being said, Despicable Me 2 has been one of my must-see movies all summer long...and it didn't disappoint me one bit.  As an easy target for slap-stick comedy (and I'll give you one guess who my favorite comedy trio is), the Minions are good for wholesome unadulterated laughter.  As usual, their antics and gibberish talk will have you laughing to the limit - but only if you're interested in that sort of thing.  It's easy to imagine Despicable Me being everyone's favorite animated feature, or quite honestly the animated film you'll never want to see again.  Just because The Three Stooges brand of humor is my thing doesn't mean it's going to agree with everyone's style of humor.  In fact, it's pretty easy to imagine someone describing a film of this nature as being \\"dumb\\" or \\"pointless.\\"  However, if that's how you felt about the first film, I couldn't disagree with you more.<br /><br />While the first film focused more on the girls and their quest to find a home to call their own (and a father to care for them), Despicable Me 2 focuses much more on the Minions.  In fact, at a short 90 minutes or so, it almost feels like the girls are absent from the film entirely.  Speaking of a reduced role, Russell Brand's character, Dr. Nefariou (although important to the film's climax) is also absent for the majority of the film.  However, that's not to say the film isn't without enjoyable characters.  Between the Minions and the plump villain in question, Eduardo Perez (originally voiced by Al Pacino, but changed to Benjamin Bratt just months before the film's release date), there's no shortage of memorable moments.  At the same time, there's love in the air throughout the film with the introduction of the ambitious Lucky Wilde, who (if you couldn't tell from the film's trailer) has a pretty memorable first meeting with Gru.<br /><br />There's not a whole lot to say about this film that wasn't said about the first film.  It's a family-friendly flick that absolutely anyone can enjoy.  The animation is sharp, colorful, and pristine.  Plus, the characters will have you giggling virtually nonstop.  While I'm admittedly not a huge Steve Carrell fan, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Gru - so with that being said, this is the one exception where I would be writing someone a letter on Mr. Carrell's behalf if for some reason he was ever replaced.  Regardless, the characters are clearly catching on in popularity - especially the Minions who will be getting a movie of their own, called Minions (hitting theaters in December 2014).  And, as long as the plot is solid (which it is) and the Minions are funny (which they are), Illumination Entertainment can keep punching out as many Despicable Me films as they want.<br /><br />P.S. - Make sure to stay through the credits.  The Minions will be taking auditions for their new film next year.<br /><br />Grade:  B+<br />FNDNreview.comalf if for some reason he was ever replaced.

B004132HZS|5.0|A friend let me know about this series, and I have really enjoyed watching it.  The characters are modern, quirky, engaging, and entertaining--plus there is the plot!  I really hope they continue to make it, I would love to see more!
B00B4BJY7E|5.0|I needed a cheap processor for my litecoin mining rig, and this one works perfectly.<br />It's low cost, and low power which is what I need for a litecoin rig since it doesn't use the processor for the tasks it performs 24/7.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I really enjoyed this series, and hope that they continue to make it.  Great characters, interesting plots--have now watched it several times!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|DotP finally comes to android, and it's pretty good. The limited multiplayer is disappointing. Originally bought through the play store, and it crashed every time I tried to start the campaign. The amazon version works great though.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I've enjoyed the title song since the first time I heard it, before I was even aware of the French Revolution theme.  Then, when I learned about that aspect of it, I really wanted to get the entire album.  My family tree on my father's side traces back to the French royal family (not the kingly line, but some of the lords and great-houses), so my relatives were, essentially, on the 'wrong side' of the revolution, as was the fictitious lead character in the song; (clearly they weren't all beheaded before leaving for America, because we're still here, lol).  But anyway, it's interesting to identify with this aspect of it the songs on this album, as well as the cover art.  Thanks.
B004HW7JH4|3.0|I have received most of these as gifts but this last one isn't that interesting.  I am surprised that Mad Men continues to be a series on T.V.  I will probably not purchase the next season.  It has lost its relevance for me.
B00786XVOG|5.0|i love this cd and dvd pack i have been a yanni fan from the day he started his concerts have seen him here at foxwoods and mohigan sun casinos i see on line he is not in the us yet looks wonderful his new music is awesome i cant wait for him to come back to conneticut or somewhere here in ri too he has many fans who  would like to see his latest music he is immensely popular
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This works really well for me.  It is especially helpful while traveling as I don't like hotel alarms and the choices available on this work for me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|amazing you should and houses. but over all it is awesome. I loved it I have the computer version. at home.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Like some other reviews, if you don't want to pay the $2 for more than 3 hints, download the other &quot;free&quot;game and then you have unlimited hints. Like the developers say, more floor levels to come.<br />Great game.<br />I like this particular floor puzzle game over some other ones I have. It makes it more challenging.
1932100660|5.0|Very interesting read and will change how you look at the dairy industry. Written by a doctor who was raised on a farm who was out to prove how good dairy was for you! Worth the read.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I am a big fan of the movie, but not a fan of this game. Would not load on my kindle fire hd.

B00CGPPMKU|5.0|This is one of the greatest apps I have ever gotten! I could do it all day. It is like a world of possibilities!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I bought this four disc set to satisfy my interest in this Ridley Scott film. I like to play the commentary when I am doing other things around the house. Eventually, I will also watch the other background features. This film set exceeded my expectations. I bought it because I do not see this being transferred into Blu Ray in the future. I also own the Blu Ray but this set  had more depth. I will buy from this seller again, it arrived quickly and in great, nearly new shape. Five stars for satisfaction.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Read the three that are in the series and they have been good for keeping my attention. Some compare them to fifty shades but I feel it's similar but different enough to be in its own category
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Good ACTION / ADVENTURE with well interwoven Mythological History.<br />GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS<br /><br />Artful layering of plot & multiple sub-plots and even couple of twists that were Not TOO apparent.<br /><br />Humorous segments well done and well balanced.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Good calculator if you sew. Would like to have a decimal in the calculator. But so far it's been useful for what I need it for.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I enjoyed the fast pace of this story.  The story has many twists and turns as well as some very shocking events.  I felt for the main character.  I highly recommend!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you liked The Kite Runner, you'll love this book. The story is rich and the writing is outstanding. I hated for this book to end.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|My fiance loves David Tennant better, but I really like Matt Smith.  I like his eccentricity and passion as the Doctor.  Great series for anyone who loves the Doctor Who series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|An amazing trilogy from beginning to end!!!!!! Could not put it down !!!! Collins did an amazing job developing the characters and story.
1608871827|5.0|unlike allot of other crappy movie \\"art of\\" books, this one is packed with the concept art and sketches you want to see. The actual art.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Already in the first chapter, tears are coming. This book got me from chapter one until the last page.<br /><br />It's beautiful written with stories flowing from different personages, and in the end, all coming together.<br /><br />Great book !!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this app - please create more rooms soon.  Not too hard - not too easy - just right.  gets my brain working but also fun.  well done.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everything is great with this series, characters, setting, plot, actors.  Have watched it twice and probably will do so again.
B003IY48PS|5.0|Great Movie I liked the surround system in the movie and the sharp images<br /><br />Love it more than the new one!!
B005LAII08|5.0|We rented this movie on OnDemand and my daughter fell in love with it.  By looking around I found this complete set for about $15 cheaper than through the Disney Movie Club, of which I am a member.  Love that we got all forms of the movie, especially since we have a 3D t.v.
B004GXHOGK|5.0|This was a nice addition to our collection.<br />It's well detailed, and painted with nice realistic features . Ordering some animals are hit, and miss, but we got a winner here. ;-)
B005544V6A|5.0|All the characters are well defined and strongly characterized. Gina Torres is really great in her role as the boss
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|Fun.. but way to short for $1.99.. Four chapters just isn't enough.. And after the first couple chapters the puzzles became a bit predictable.. Hoping for a FREE update with more chapters..
B008G3N71W|1.0|I received an email that said this book was cutting edge to Fifty Shades of Gray. I was reluctant to pay 2.99 but felt it may be worth it. I was wrong. It lacked the substance it needed for an erotic book similar to Fifty Shades and that it was constantly repetitive and jumped around that I wasn't sure what was going on. In the end I'm not even sure what the heck happened.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Everything about this book was HORRIBLE. I can't believe CH chose to end this what could have been an amazing series on this note.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers headed to be more than temple run or any other endless runner and it has suceeded. With interesting awards, New locations, and many characters to pick from, this game is a blast!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|What can I say? This is another Disney classic from the story line to the great music in this DVD. My 2 year old loves it!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app. Everyone needs to get this app.  It will save someone's life one day if it has not already.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another great book by Khaled! I love reading about this country and am trying to understand what is going on over there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is good you could get it.  It is good because you can be creative in mind  You kill animals to get food.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Online play is super fun. Capture the flag mode, team modes are all really fun. Game tracks your stats and allows for many upgrades for $$$.  I am a fan. Great game.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This was by far the best book I've ever read! I loved it so much and I'll probably read a million more times!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series has everything anyone could possibly want in an English drama.  Julian Fellows is meticulous in his historical accuracy and character portrayal is so believable - the acting is brilliant<br />Watch this if you haven't already
B000SP1SEO|5.0|i loved the quick paced hilarity of SNATCH. Brad PITT is at his best comedicaly, and one needs subtitles to understand his english in SNATCH. Snatch is one of the best British movies I have ever seen, where I truly understood &#34;the British humor&#34; and could watch it again,again, and again.<br /><br />young and old...keep watchin&#34; those movies my lovlies......Wallyenquist@yahoo,com
B0063M22QO|3.0|Not like the original Mahjong for pc but still fun.  I especially like the shuffle feature in this game.  Makes playing less frustrating.<br /><br />Jgoodman
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|wild, crazy, fun....great writer....scampering to keep up with the slippery slopes of the story line.  It's out there!  But so are we!
B004X6PRO6|1.0|This author did a credible job writing of the cruelties, deprivations, and living conditions of NK citizens and did a very good job of making the reader understand exactly what life is like under the present regimes. However, he went on and on in what I thought was a most confusing fashion to reveal the above conditions. I found myself lost as the author went back and forth from one subject to another. Then there were the endless stories ( perhaps parables ). I would never recommend this book. I always try to read every Pulitzer Prize novel - not sure how this book won that award.
B00B8WXFWE|3.0|I recently got this CD. I don't like 10 nearly as much as The Block (the previous album)--quite frankly I find 10 boring compared to The Block. There are a few songs I like (Remix for example) but I just don't get excited about the songs like I did with the songs on The Block. I hope NKOTB's next album is more in line with The Block than with 10.
0385486804|4.0|This book was purchased as mandatory summer reading for my high school student. Product was in good shape as listed. Shipping time was good.
B00C061I3K|5.0|If you want to know what my initial reaction to this album was, just look at the one-star reviews.  I liked listening to it the first time, which I did by turning out the lights and really focusing.  After that, though, it seemed to lack depth so I set it to the side.  For whatever reason and mostly because I couldn't decide what else to use as background music as I was working and doing things around the house, I pulled it back out and the songs and their sequencing just sounded better, if not edgy, with each listen.  \\"Edge\\" is not the purpose of this album.  If anything, there's comfort in the nostalgia of using Giorgio Moroder (the guy behind Donna Summer's most successful period) and Nile Rodgers, one of the founders of Chic and the producer of defining albums for Diana Ross (\\"Diana\\"), David Bowie (\\"Let's Dance\\") and Madonna (\\"Like a Virgin\\"). It's fascinating how generous Daft Punk is in letting Giorgio talk about his beginnings as the intro to his track \\"Giorgio by Moroder\\" (very pleasant and very Giorgio) and as it ends. That's reverence.  Plus, they use John Robinson, the second drummer for Rufus who later played on Quincy Jones' biggest albums as a producer, including the first to MJ-QJ collaborations, and the biggest of Jones' own albums.  They also use my favorite drummer, Omar Hakim, who played with Weather Report then with Sting's first post-Police band then toured with, among others, Madonna.  Hakim is fun and fluid to watch and is the only drummer I've seen who makes the drumsticks look like an extension of his arms.  I still cringe when \\"Touch\\" comes on and when it ends because it sounds like that guy's about to cry but the song itself is good when it gets going. I don't need to say anything about the convergence of Daft Punk, Nile Rogers and Pharrell Williams on \\"Get Lucky\\".  A youtube commenter on the video made me laugh because his post said that, at first, he thought Nile Rogers was Dave Chappelle doing his Rick James impression.<br /><br />All of you that listened to it once and dismissed it, do like I did and use it as background when you're doing other things and not putting any pressure on it.  Because I'm currently working at home and very focused on what I'm doing, there are days when I've played it four and even five times in succession.  Again, I fully understand the perspective of the one-star reviewers but it really is a good album given the chance.  I think the last albums I could listen to repeatedly in the same session were Outkast's \\"The Love Belove/Music Box\\", Madonna's \\"Bedtime Stories\\", Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" and Paul Simon's \\"Graceland\\".  There might be others but those are the ones that come to mind.  Over the last few years I rarely listen to full albums and usually just put iTunes and my car flash drive on random play but I'll only play this album all the way through (for now).  I've rediscovered Steely Dan's \\"Aja\\" recently so I'm playing that repeatedly in its entirety as well.  If you like that album, you'll gain even more of an appreciation for it after watching that edition of VH-1's \\"Classic Albums\\" series.  What a great series.  The one on \\"Nevermind\\" is also good.  All of the ones I've seen are.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I now have the entire series of Star Trek movies on Blu-ray. From Star Trek The Movie all the way through the originals and then the Next Generation. I love 'em!
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|There are still some songs at the end that haven't caught my interest yet, but I'm still relistening. I love the music, movement, and lyrics. I look forward to hearing more from this band.
0451232852|5.0|I am only half way through this book but it is a great book of history with plenty of delightful human elements thrown in.  I want to finish it so I can get the second to read.  Ken Follett has long been a favorite author of mine and having found this trlogy is a major high point.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Having never heard of thia series before i decided for .99 id try it. Loved it and for a dollar more bought the world pass. WAY worth the two dollars total
0553801473|3.0|George R.R. Martin, A Dance With Dragons<br /><br />This book became annoyingly slow-paced compared to the first three books and even the fourth.<br /><br />I felt like several of the early POV characters were old friends that I was reunited with, especially since I hadn't ready book 3 in awhile and that's when we last saw them.<br /><br />I like Jon's tense negotiations with Stannis. Jon seemed to be trying to offer neutral advice like a maester might. Also, I wonder if he was trying to get Stannis out of the way by sending him elsewhere. I loved the setting feel of most of the Jon chapters.<br /><br />I'm honestly unsure what I feel about Daenerys' leadership.<br /><br />Theon's story was an amazing chilling description of torture.<br /><br />I identified with Tyrion's cover story strategy, basing it on personal experience he did have, which would help him stay in character and make it plausible.<br /><br />I loved it the way Davos talked trash when speaking the truth at Manderly's court. Heck, a lot of people in that hall were being brutally honest. Even as a Robb fan, Rhaegar Frey had a point with his rant about Robb's poor decisions.<br /><br />The theory that Bloodraven is Bran's guru is obvious when reading that Bran chapter.<br /><br />Obviously, the Ramsay/\\"Arya\\" wedding was a cruel farce, but I liked the detail about how weddings work for followers of the old gods.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I first gave up on reading this book because I just didn't like it.  But then I continue to see it on the best seller list and I thought maybe I had made a mistake.  So the second time I stuck with it until the end - and same answer:  I just didn't like it.
0425263924|5.0|I love this book. Number 3 of the Crossfire series. Love Gideon Cross. Cant wait for the next one. Like Sylvia Day's writing
0385341008|5.0|Best book I read in 2012. Most of the story is in letters from one person to another; don't let that throw you. This is a love story, a war story, a story about the families we make of friends, and the way that books help us understand each other and survive. You're going to laugh, cry, and really, really want a book club.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. You get to build a lot of cool buildings and in the movie theater you can collect acorns.  You can also play games. I would totally get this game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game very challenging. I like that there are lots of different puzzles to solve this game. I am enjoying the game a lot.can't wait to see what the other levels have in store. It would be nice if there were some hints for when u get really stuck
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I found it to be very entertaining. Can't wait to read the next book. Hope others like it as much as I did.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|It was amazing I totally loved it and I can't wait for the movie! Thanks, authors! I look forward to the rest of the series!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the game! Need more levels!!! A must play game!  Really makes you think to solve puzzles. Give it a try!
B00BCX2F66|4.0|This is a nice case not saying it's the best but it's really nice. I've had it for a little over 2 months now and I'm satisfied with it. Sure with in use and what not it's not going to hold up the phone as it would new, but it still does it's job. Get's a little dirty on the inside red area, doesn't scratch the phone luckily(from my personal experience) It's good to hold, and good to pocket, also covers the screen which is nice since I always put the phone and the keys together. It's easy to clip on and clip off, and not sliding off. If the once I currently have were to tear or if I were to lose it, would definitely buy another.

0380789019|4.0|Regarding [Neverwhere] - there are a handful of Gaiman books that I hadn't taken the time to read and I managed to snag paperback copies cheaply, recently so I decided to get through as many as I could. I've read Gaiman back to his stint with Marvelman and through his magnum opus, the Sandman series, all in comic book/graphic novel forms. I consider myself a fan, even though I also understand that his style isn't for everyone. Most recently I read books in this order: [American Gods] (exceptional), [Anansi Boys] (very good) and [Neverwhere] (good plus). The first two are similar in writing style with plenty of humor, the earlier, Neverwhere is full of imagery that harkens back to his work in comics and in my mind is not as sophisticated (mature may be a better word). The novel is also a bit dated. I do like the \\"London Under\\" concept although similar has been done before in both books and TV (one of my favorites is the sequence in \\"Big Trouble in Little China\\"). I also liked Gaiman's twist on the homeless as part of this underworld, beneath the notice of \\"top dwellers\\" and his handling of meetings between the two worlds. What this novel lacked was a sense of cohesiveness that his later novels have - there are scenes and descriptions that add little to the overall pacing, character development and world building. Not to say that the novel is bad, however some of the characters' motivations are one-dimensional and you aren't given explanations for their actions, other than \\"favors are owed\\" - I got the feeling that the book was a setup for another novel or series at times and perhaps it is?<br /><br />In all, I'd say the novel is worth reading, especially if you like his work. Otherwise (and if you're time is precious), stick to his later books.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|SO bad. Lost interest at about the 20 minute mark. Movie didn't seem to go anywhere, and I felt like I had seen it before. Not original, not exciting, nothing keeping me on the edge of my seat or shielding my eyes from being scared. Just boring. I think I  was on my Facebook through most of it. That shows you how uninteresting the movie was. Made me want to go get Reality Bites so Ethan Hawke could redeem himself.
0345457692|5.0|A very well conceived book, Altered Carbon explores the concept of human memory/personality storage and how the technology would affect the development of society and space colonization as a broad scope topic, while providing a very human adventure/detective narrative for the protagonist. There are many reviews on Amazon regarding the storyline itself so I won't add to the rhetoric - as a new author to me, Richard K. Morgan hit on many interesting topics and struck home several times with his character Takeshi Kovacs - there are moments that made me laugh, scenes that brought me close to tears, and several that invoked a sense of wonder that I rarely get out of literary works. I would recommend this book to any new adult SF reader, though with a warning on some of the sex and drug scenes, which may be offensive to some - however even those instances were really well written and worth reading.

B004ULNJIU|5.0|I've really grown to love Jason Statham; he's Britain's latest hardman in movies, perhaps taking the crown from Ray Winstone. Is the 'Stath' a great actor; not necessarily, but he looks good, he's tough and macho, has a designer beard that millions of less swarthy guys would kill for, he is convincing and he is charismatic and a great screen presence. I watched 'Blitz' not particularly expecting that much, but enjoyed it from start to finish. Good plot, good characters, great London locations and a film that doesn't pull any punches and does what it says on the tin. We want action, and that's what we get! So if you like Statham, hard-edged British crime thrillers and good acting and great action/violence/suspense, this is the film for you.

0061474355|5.0|Being a long standing fan of both fantasy (the likes of Philip Pullman and David Eddings amongst others) and science fiction I am always wary when picking up new books that have been hyped in the press. The reason being that I often find myself sadly disappointed and returning to my old favourites. \\"Sabriel\\" was not such an occasion - Garth Nix has managed to successfully squirm his way into my favourite fantasy author list.<br /><br />The book is an absolute dream to read from beginning to end and although it is aimed at a younger audience (according to the marketing), being in my 20s I can honestly say that I didn't notice. Garth Nix's writing flows beautifully and his rich world combining magic with \\"normality\\" and his original and carefully crafted realm of Death are breathtaking in their vividness and scope. The careful balance between humour and dark fantasy is never lost and is skilfully played out through the characters (Mogget and Sabriel being my personal favourites).<br /><br />I have \\"Lirael\\" sitting next to my bed now, and I can't wait to read it. Even if you're only curious - you won't be sorry you picked it up (unless you can't afford to buy the rest.... :) )
B003VANOFY|1.0|If you were thinking about buying these, don't.  The microphone on my second pair just stopped working, mid-call, after a month.  It also takes 2-4 presses of the on button to get it to turn on.  My first pair had many issues including a microphone that would not stay up in the mute position and no correlation between the charge status of the headset and the charge status in the software that came with the set.  Seems that there is no quality control on these and you might get a pair that works but will probably spend your time sending them back.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|So, I waited eagerly for what I thought was the conclusion of Gideon & Eva's story!! The book came out on 6/4 but because I left on vacation 6/6 I waited to start the book so I could enjoy it uninterrupted! It was a good book BUT it left lots of questions unanswered that I wrongly assumed would be answered in this book. In addition (as I was reading this on my kindle), I was STUNNED at the ending! As long as you know there's another book coming you will give it more stars than I did BUT since I thought it was the end it made for a disappointing read. Can't wait for book 4. I will continue to read the series as its hot and spicy but will never assume its the end until it says its the end on her web page.

B00BN1QV0S|5.0|Claudio Abbado seems to have had two careers. His early opera recordings have (mostly) stood the test of time with Verdi being the composer with whom he felt most comfortable. His DGG recordings of Macbeth and Simon Boccanegra are especially fine. Abbado's Rossini Il Barbiere di Siviglia, with a brilliant Hermann Prey as Figaro, joins recordings under Marriner and Gui as one of the finest ever made. Abbado's early symphonic recordings, on the other hand, have always struck me as somewhat uneven. Moments of true excitement and intelligent interpretation were occasionally marred by a lack of distinctiveness in vision and even a certain banality in spots. Abbado's Beethoven cycle made for DGG in the 1980s was serviceable - the Eroica I thought the best of the nine - but were hardly comparable to some of the finest cycles recorded over the years.<br /><br />This has all changed over the past two decades. With Abbado battling a life-threatening illness, and advancing age yielding a greater profundity of vision, his symphonic output has undergone a metamorphosis of startling dimensions. Few would argue that Abbado's recent audio and video recordings of the Mahler symphonies are not amongst the finest ever made. Contained within this collection are Mahler's complete symphonies, all but No.2 performed live by the Berlin Philharmonic and dating mostly from recordings made over the past 15 years. The jewel of the cycle is the 2nd Symphony, which is an emotionally probing and intensely moving vision of death and resurrection, performed live by Abbado's signature Lucerne Festival Orchestra in a recording made in August 2003. This Symphony No.2 is searing in its intensity and will not fail to burn its way into your psyche. Everything that has made Abbado's Mahler so singular is in evidence in this collection.<br /><br />Abbado proves himself a gifted conductor of Bruckner, with Symphonies Nos. 4, 5, 7 and 9 featuring the Vienna Philharmonic included here, all performances dating from the 1990s. Once again the gem of the collection is a brilliant Bruckner Symphony No.1 performed by the Lucerne Festival Orchestra in a live recording made in August 2012. This is an expansive and emotionally satisfying vision of the symphony. Comparisons with their Mahler collaboration are inevitable and there are obvious influences, as this is a less reticent, more forceful Bruckner who now storms heaven rather than knocking timidly at the gates.<br /><br />Abbado's versions of Mendelssohn's orchestral music, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and dating from the 1980s, is a superb set and perhaps the finest symphonic cycle Abbado recorded during that decade. His Symphonies 3, 4 and 5 are atmospheric, mysterious and exciting by turns. What really distinguishes the series are brilliant renditions of Mendelssohn's overtures/tone poems: A Midsummer's Night's Dream, The Hebrides, Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage, The Fair Melusina and Ruy Blas. All of the color and instrumental distinctiveness that signify Mendelssohn at his finest are in evidence. These are scintillating performances in which the scores come to life, proving that Mendelssohn's music does not lack depth or substance.<br /><br />Abbado's Schubert cycle is quite good, although the youthful composer did not really hit his stride in composing for full orchestra until his final two symphonies. The Haydn symphonies included here - Symphonies Nos. 93, 96, 98, 100-104 and the Sinfonia Concertante that is labeled Symphony No.105 - were recorded during the 1990s and feature the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, who are superb. This is sparkling, witty Haydn with moments of melodic suavity that are stunning. One wishes there were complete \\"Paris\\" and \\"London\\" Symphony cycles available. Abbado's Brahms orchestral cycle featuring the Berlin Philharmonic is by turns lyrically beautiful, darkly autumnal and intellectually probing: with a profundity that can be heartbreaking at times as the music depicts a relentless fate that is preparing the tragically inevitable for us all. The Beethoven cycle featuring the Berliners dates from 2000-2001 and is unquestionably Abbado's finest yet released. This is monumental, heroic Beethoven, filled with rough humor and deep pathos. All of the Beethoven symphonies exhibit Abbado's years of experience performing this music, and reveal a mature re-thinking of what he had previously recorded.<br /><br />Rounding out the collection are Abbado's lighter, fleeter Mozart Symphonies Nos. 29, 33, 35, 38-41 featuring his \\"historically informed\\" Orchestra Mozart. If you prefer your Mozart performed in the traditional fashion you may be put-off by this modern approach. If, however, you are an old hand at original instrument performances you will find Abbado's Mozart sleek and lyrical with none of the Romantic accretions that have marred earlier interpretations. The sound of all of these recorded performances is uniformly good, with the live ones lovingly reproduced and free from any artifacts or distractions that I could detect. All of this collection's music is allowed to breathe, with a soundstage that is atmospheric and spacious combined with excellent imaging and a naturalistic presence. The set rewards good quality headphones if you have them. Claudio Abbado has become a great symphonic conductor and this collection, whose performances were personally chosen by him, is a fitting monument to his skill and sensitivity.<br /><br />Mike Birmanntless fate that is preparing the tragically inevitable for us all.

B0010SEMP0|4.0|First book a 4.5 this one is a solid 4<br /><br />\\"Once you go dead, there's no one better in bed!\\" ~ Cat\\"<br /><br />This was a solid follow up to Halfway to the Grave, not quite as good but definitely not a large drop off.<br /><br />It is four years after Cat left Bones to save him. She has a dangerous exciting job, but is still completely miserable without Bones in her life. The only complaint I have is it took a little time for Bones to come into play in the book and that is just because I missed their banter. But his entrance was spectacular so it is just a minor complaint. There is still a lot of dark humor in the book and Bones and Cat's mom's fighting is hilarious. Bones is so much fun that he almost steals the show.<br /><br />\\"Wrong way, Bones. The men's showers are in the opposite direction.\\"<br />I'll file that away with all the other information that doesn't pertain to me\\" was Bones' mocking reply.\\"<br /><br />Cat has grown up a lot in the last four years and now she is a lot stronger overall. I liked how utterly tough she is and there were enough twists and action to keep things really interesting. As soon as Bones is in the picture again the book really picked up for me. Definitely one of my favorite UF PNR series right under Fever.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|The journey is interesting to read about, even though it was hard for me to identify with the life experience that led to it.  I often felt that the author was too close to the emotions to make sure that the reader is on the same level of engagement with the experience.  It was a relatively quick read...a bit self-indulgent at times, and hit a few of my writing style pet-peeves, especially a penchant for exaggerated language and a sometimes seemingly-forced use of metaphor.  There are many interesting moments and details about the trail and the hiking experience, which I did enjoy.  I probably appreciated it more as a strange kind of travelogue than for a coming-of-age story.

B005OGYH90|5.0|Mostly listen to the CD, which is awesome.  If you like Slash's album Apocalyptic Love, you will also like this.  Very similar in style, except maybe a little more diversity and includes lots of older GNR or SnakePit songs.  DVD is good, but only has like 5 songs and the rest is interviews.  Also comes with a poster of Slash which is pretty cool.

B0007XT87G|5.0|Deadwing (2005) finds Porcupine Tree in top form and is loaded with excellent playing and songwriting. Although a bit heavier and louder than some of their earlier albums, the music on this album is still killer Porcupine Tree through-and-through. Overall, this is one of the few newer groups that really grabs me.<br /><br />The album blends the influences of heavy groups like Opeth with melancholy, softer passages and has a gloom to it that I find very appealing - not sure why I like the gloom so much - it just seems to resonate more.  These are dark times after all and Porcupine Tree seems to have successfully tapped into this. The level of musicianship is fairly high and the arrangements are generally well thought out - the individual tracks seem to be arranged in a larger work. One pleasant surprise was the guitar solo by Adrian Belew (King Crimson).<br /><br />The CD comes with a booklet that features a series of arty images, along with the recording credits.  The sound quality is very high.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great album by a mature group with a mature sound.  Although heavier than some of the earlier albums, this is fantastic stuff that paves the way for the excellent Fear of a Blank Planet (2007). Highly recommended along with In Absentia (2002) and Fear of a Blank Planet.

B001BKVWYG|5.0|The story of Rodriguez is very compelling. He was nearly lost to American audiences for eternity except for the fact that he was an absolute sensation in South Africa in the 70's and 80's before falling into obscurity.  I was introduced to Rodriguez  by my brother who sent me a DVD documenting the search for this lost talent. His counterculture songs are perhaps in the genre of Bob Dylan. I don't know that they necessarily speak to today's youth but the songs are certainly melodic, and for someone of my generation, nostalgic of the social revolution of the 60's and 70's.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|As a 28 year old woman, I was concerned this book would not appeal to me, however after reading the positive reviews I purchased it. I should have purchased the combo pack because this book is EXCELLENT. I'm a fast reader, and I tend to fly through books sadly. This one occupied me for a few weeks, and i was reading daily. Great book, full of suspense! I'm reading the second one now.
B00957T6X6|4.0|This series is kind of hard to get into with trying to recognize names, families and who lives where.  But once the story line starts to flow and you start seeing the connections I started to enjoy the series more.  It is a descriptive read.  Sometimes too much so but it is to help you feel more involved in the story line, I feel.  I just finished book one I am anxious to read the rest of the story!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved reading this book to follow up on the Crossfire series. However I was mad that towards the end I realized I wouldn't be finishing the series, and would have to wait for the 4th book to come out!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book felt like non-stop action and suspense until the end.  Everyone had gone a little crazy!  The very end of the book leaves you wanting more or to hear more about how the characters are getting along.  But it also helps you understand her actions and why she did them.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I became of fan of several of the actors based on this show. Space cowboys  - what's not to love? Be sure to watch Serenity after this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it made you fall in love with the characters even more.  They were definitely developed in this book!  And I admired how the author's focus wasn't so much on the Tween romance but more about the unrest of the districts and President's control.  The beginning of the book had too much &#34;review&#34; of the 1st book for me, but this could have been because I read this book almost immediately after the first.  I would recommend this entire series to anyone who would like a few quick, easy books to read over the summer.

0451418441|5.0|I started with Pillars of the Earth because I really like Ken Follet but these are keepers for my library.  The characters are so vivid you want to get in the pages and kill some of them.  The good are good and the bad are really bad.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|My wife and our three year old daughter sat down to enjoy this film, and I can actually say that the three year old sat through almost the entire film glued to the screen (and the popcorn).  Tangled is quite enjoyable.  The plot and characters are all wonderfully portrayed and can engage a wide age range and sophistication of various audience members.  Though the songs are all great fun, none of them will necessarily stick in your head.  They service the narrative more than lyrical.<br /><br />The only negative I can really point out, which is near impossible to avoid with most fairy tales and is at the very heart of this well known classic, is the inherent mother issues.  Not sure how you can avoid the evil-mother archetype grounded in this particular story, amongst others, but it shouldn't be ignored.  Depending on your child's age and comprehension level it might be something worth discussing with them.  Let them know that their own mother isn't out to steal their youth to remain young forever.  I may be being oversensitive here but Disney is riddled with characters that walk a thin line with regard to stereotypes, most prevalently in their female ones: Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Little Mermaid, etc.<br /><br />With all that warning aside, Tangled has an excellent female lead who, though they've been sheltered and left in a tower most of their life, can assert herself and take control of her destiny and become whatever she dreams.  That's a role model I can get behind and hopefully so can my daughter.

B00D2K40WY|3.0|There aren't a lot of options to this game. There's only one character you can play with, and few makeup/clothing options. It got boring when I first played with it a lot. I hope you can revise this game and include at least two characters and unlock all of the makeup/clothing options.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great game!!!!! Is it possible to have more scenery or different play areas? That would make for even more fun!!!!!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I enjoyed watching Safe Haven, it really is a good movie! I liked the plot and how it unfolded throughout the movie. The little twist at the ending was unexpected, although I did have a feeling it would be something like that.  I don't want to say more and give it away.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|Love this game please fix this I cannot connect to Facebook to cash in on achievements I play on Kindle Fire HD I play on iPod as well and was very happy to play on my Kindle please fix this bug . ........other than that love the game
B0028IDXDS|3.0|I always give 5 stars for wubbanubs bc my daughter loves them so much. SHe lights up every time she see them. They are perfect for babies who can't hold their binki in their mouth very well (much like my daughter.) They have flaws such as the cleaning hassle and the brand is in the works of making some for older babies (these are only meant for 0-6). Which sucks bc my daughter is 6m. At least they are trying. But what made me give this 3 stars is not bc of these reasons. i would still give it a 5. The pros totally out wight the cons. but why this particular one earned 3 stars is bc when received it had cotton sticking out of the stitches. It had a huge knot of thread where it was sew shut. The tail had no filling. JUst a long piece of cloth. THe whole monkey felt less filled then her kitty that she has. Other then that its works great. I was just upset about the quality. Shipping back would take wayyyyy to long as i am stationed overseas. It takes forever to send and receive mail out here so i just dealt with it. My daughter can care less about the threading. She loves her wubbanubs.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|You can taste the excitement. The surreal reality of how a culture, a government, and society can warp time and humanity.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I wanted to surprise my wife with this Blu-ray/DVD combo of the Sound of Music, to watch on Mother's Day evening. I was surprised at the high prices for many DVDs of The Sound of Music. Then I found the 45th Anniversary collection for a great price! I like the fact that the Blu-ray and DVD are bundled together. We don't have a Blu-ray player yet, but others in our family do. The combo works well for all players. We had absolutely no problem with the DVD and we enjoyed this classic musical without issue. If these are still being sold and you want your own combo collection of The Sound of Music, then I highly recommend this 45th anniversary blu-ray/DVD combo!
0062255657|3.0|The death of the printed book can only be hastened by such a poorly finished product.  The edges of the pages are so frayed from being poorly cut that you cannot turn the pages.  Cheap production like this with such high list prices will only add to the early death of the printed book.  This printer should be banned.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I never knew what a pick Edison was! A great read about a great but often forgotten man. An easy read.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Not much else to say about this album that hasn't already been said. Listening to this is like running into an old friend again, and finding out your relationship hasn't much changed.<br /><br />Welcome back, y'all.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I was expecting somewhat of a Batman, Dark Knight type of score but got something a little different and a little more hopeful.  It took a few listens but I really like what he did with this score.  The expanded edition is nice to hear tracks like &#34;Are You Listening Clark&#34; and &#34;Earth,&#34; especially.  Not to mention, &#34;Hans' Man of Steel Sketchbook.&#34;  Well done!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The book was as great as the Kite Runner . It describes beautifully life in Afghanistan and the dispersion of its people ? The huge cast of characters was a plus in that it allowed multiple facets of life to be discovered, but it did add some confusion to the reading process . I stayed up all night last night reading this ... A night well spent !
0061989142|4.0|If you've read one you've sort of read them all . . . but it's nice to have a hard copy &#34;go to&#34; book when trying to build a quality and versatile wardrobe. Nothing revolutionary, but cute and always love LC!
B006ICGH56|4.0|Directed by Chris Hansen in the  1990s, LA Confidential was set in the 1950s and starred an ensemble cast without a \\"true\\" star, though Danny DeVito, Kevin Spacy and Kim Basinger came the closest. The period look of the 50s was created not from the stereotypes of the period but in a more subtly realistic way, and then left to provide the background of a movie driven by character development and converging character lines. Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce, Australians both, portray two of the central three LA cops: the muscle heavy Crowe and the bespectacled intellectual Pearce determined to follow the rules. Kevin Spacy brings a suave Hollywood chic to the third. Though suffused with sunlight and bright decors and absent most of the diagonals, low angles, and chiaroscuro lighting of film noir, this film captures the moral ambiguities and the existential displacement of the noir world in a very different cinematic light. Kim Basinger is beautiful as the Veronica Lake lookalike femme fatale who is also the girl next door from Arizona. Danny DeVito provides a kind of VoiceOver narrative from the Hush Hush world of the original LA Confidential  magazine. Terrific supporting cast and beautiful music by Jerry Goldsmith.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I liked the narration in this.  I would recommend this book.  You feel very connected to the mainland supporting character s.
B004GYY714|5.0|I had trouble getting radio reception at home due to the foil radiant barrier we installed in the attic.  This app lets me listen to all my local stations without having to run an external antenna.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie was fantastic!  The colors are something out of this world.  Very imaginative and unique.  I love movies that think outside the box.  This one hit the mark.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not very long, but fun while it lasted. Not super hard, but enough to keep you busy for a while.  Hopefully more rooms will be added soon.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Tear jerker for sure.  Younger actors were so believable.  This movie is fantastic and a wonderful tribute to those who perished in the tsunami.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Have played this game on my PC for some time.  Glad to be able to play it on my Kindle.
B00006JSS8|5.0|I brought one for me and one as a gift for my grandson  stevie wonder the hits of my generation of the 20th century is a+
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Love Love Love! Need I say more? Who doesn't love Michael Buble'? This is one of my favorite albums of his.
B000083E79|5.0|my favorite music by cher and she is an American goddess in her ageless generation of our decade... I give this cd a grade a+
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book in the series is by far the best.  It's hard to put it down.  I can't wait to read what's in store for them.
1452110581|5.0|Love this book!  It covers all of my cats personalities.  I can hear my cats saying some of the poems.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Interesting concept, with good characters, evil characters, characters that redeem themselves and characters that fail to be redeemed.  I am interested in seeing what the other silos are up to.
B00BFQKEVS|5.0|This is a very good reminder that markets are not infallible and that they exist only to distribute goods.  With the growing gap of income distribution and the fact that everything is monetized in our society, I wish this were required reading.
B004J64QSI|5.0|We have watched it 4 times and never get tired of the whole splendid production.  Way, way better than the lackluster film.  The voices are superb, the melodies enchanting...we loved the cast, the music, the lineup of previous actors in earlier production.  I have given away 4 DVDs of this production to friend and relatives.
B009O07NDY|5.0|This is a great album set. It is great background music to work. It helps you to concentrate better too.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|this was a really good book with a twist i didn't see coming.  it held my interest and made me care about the characters.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Best movie ive seen for this musical with great acting it is a close as you can get to seeing it on stage
B00000IZOR|5.0|I'm glad to be able to get one of these for my son as I had one, too! I wish it was made in America (ha!), but I got it anyway. He loves it. The eyes move when you pull it around just like the old one. The only odd thing is that the phone cord is painfully short. I know it's for safety's sake, but wow! Good toy! :)
B00AEFY66U|5.0|This is the best film of Gatsby. Redford is perfect in the role, and Mia shows all the dimensions Fitzgerald gave Daisy in the book. A must-see!!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This was a good narrative, kind of disjointed with the jumping from location to location.  I realize that this was meant to be fiction based on oral history (which usually means it's based on someone who has lived through the period)  but came out a bit confusing.  If you are into the zombie genre, this book is for you.  If not, you may want to think twice before checking this book out.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Amazing book! A unique idea, well executed, definitely worth the read! Can't wait to start the next one soon :)
B006Y5H74W|5.0|A much more sophisticated musical TV show. Loved it and I'm heartbroken that the show was cancelled after only two seasons. Two seasons were not enough of the great music, great characters, and good acting. Wah!!!!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I miss movies like this. Action, family friendly and a sweet story.  This movie is a great family movie night choice! Pop some popcorn, grab some candy and drinks and enjoy.
B0039A8QVI|5.0|Love this song and hope to order more from Easton Corbin in the near future. He has an excellent voice which in my opinion sounds like George Strait. Which is a great thing!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved it! it was fun but hard, takes a lot of time. I wish there was more levels! I cant wait for more levels:)
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Great game. Love to play it. Have owned it without downloading for longer than a year. But when will there be an update? New cards? New decks? New campaign expansions? I'm ready for more it has become stale.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Fulkner
B00C061HZY|5.0|So I love the record, I'm sure you've heard it, or at least some of it, by now. Maybe you like it, maybe you don't.<br /><br />My review is for Amazon's guaranteed release day delivery. That did not happen. At all. Sure, I moved, but forwarding a package to a new address should not take weeks. It should take a couple days, at best.<br /><br />The worst part is, they're still selling the album for $35 when I could stroll on over to my local record shop and pick it up for about $20.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love Amazon, but when it comes to high profile vinyl releases you should probably just support your local record store, and not be lazy like me, not only will you guarantee you get it day of release, but you'll probably save about $20.
B0081336FO|5.0|I love Sherlock!! And this particular series is extremely well done! the characters are particularly well done! I hope they are planning to &#34;shoot&#34; MANY, MANY more seasons!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have found this app to be quite helpful.  The keys &amp; display are so easy to read.  This is one of my favorite Kindle apps.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|If you are a fan and even saw the movie hundred times, you should get it. I do not like 3D in movies generally but was watching this 80s hit with great interest and pleasure. The takes inside cockpits watched in 3D are really nice. Of course I prefer 2D version much more but this 3D BR disc is just a must have addition for fans!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This was the only one we were missing of all the Harry Potter movies it was great to be able to get it so fast. Thanks
B00B04NJI0|1.0|This is an appalling wannabe-of-a-grindhouse horror. The shorts, tedious and adolescent, cannot be by horror fans, let alone horror directors, so little is there that shows even a modicum of understanding of the genre, its heritage, development or recent movements or trends. These directors haplessly labour under the mistaken assumption that serious horror fans really want to see porn - hence the sad little films about fetishes, the story-less rape fantasies, blah, blah ... tedious, boring - rent or buy Hostel 1 or 2 again, or maybe take a trip down memory lane with 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' revisit Rob Zombie or a classy masterpiece like 'Audition' or, in keeping with shorts, there's always Masters of Horror. Anything with the hallmarks of horror - works by masters who understand that the genre envelops and plays with morality, cautionary tropes, social commentary, gender dynamics - you get the picture
B0053O89JM|5.0|Love House, have all the rest of the seasons, wasnt really happy to find it and get it so fast.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Thr thing I don't likr about the game is if you lose, you cannot start over and do the level again unless you turn the kindle off.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Ahhh! Love this game and I love the movie. It's so cute and fun. Glad they added it to the Amazon app store. They had it on Google play and I couldn't download it because I had no room in my mobile device. This is a great game for any age :)<br />~Cynthia~
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|A great game. You don't want to put it down once you start. It needs more levels. Still loved it
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|When I finished reading this delicious book I did not want put it away.  I began reading it again immediately.  Gaiman has the ability, shown brilliantly in this book, to write on that knife-edge of Let's Pretend without a single missed step into silly.  I can believe his world filled with action and emotion and wonderful language knowing that it is real and not real at the same time, the way a small child can believe two or more opposing realities. What a treat to be in that world.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Awesome app I like to draw with it. Got it because it was free today :P<br />I definitely would recommend this app.
B000002KXV|5.0|A classic on every level.  Background vocals by New York's finest (mostly), brilliant.  So are arrangements.  The songs are quirky, original and juicy.  Back in the day, nobody did it better.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My 7-year-old daughter is having a wonderful time with this one!  She loves changing all the makeup, clothes, hair etc.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|thanks to Disney,  we didn't loose our level when game stopped loading.  They recovered right where we left off. great for the kids &amp; didn't have to spend any money!
B00CUWKHVI|5.0|It's wonderful - very creative and original. The lyrics and other info that one usually gets with a CD can be downloaded, as well, which I appreciate! Otherwise I end up looking all over the internet for the lyrics. And his lyrics are well worth reading - poetry set to music.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The acting and writing on this show is great. I have a huge crush on Benedict. It's true, smart is the new sexy in my book.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. Yes it left u hanging, but don't they always.  Have to hook you into buying the next book.<br />I don't see why everybody is getting pinched about its ending. I enjoy all the crossfire novels. Good job Sylvia Day!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it. I just took a vacation and played this on the flight home. I also play it at home watching tv.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is a great mix of drama, wit, and comedy. I loved seasons 1 & 2 and eagerly await the release of season 3.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like that this game is entertaining even if you choose not to purchase anything. I haven't run into any bugs and I am having a great time playing with it. The graphics are great.
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie.  But am disappointed to report it did not grab my interest, I never even finished watching it.  I was hoping for something with the wit of Magnolia Hotel, but it did not deliver.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|It's a fun upbeat movie, it had me singing 'Footloose' the rest of the evening ! I think I actually like it as well as the original version, lol but don't tell Kevin & Lori :)
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|Of course, these happy hipsters did not disappoint.  This album is upbeat, feel-good, and sure to make you smile.  It makes me want to learn to play the horn.  If you are a true music fan, you should buy this album.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|A different way of telling a love story. The actress Audrey Tautou is superb as well the others actors that help her in this very creative work of surprising images and clever ideas about life and love.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|This book was recommended to me by my brother. The concept is believable and a great premise for the series. The sci-fi elements are not too heavy which makes this book great bedtime reading. There are a lot of science explanations in the book that flesh out why and how humans in the future travel through space. All of these explanations are very believable which makes it that much easier to get immersed into the universe.
B009NY43NY|2.0|What a thoughtless way to end the story line when so many faithful fans made Ms. Harris such a recognized author (she must have known many fans would be dissatisfied with an undefined ending and the road the ending seemed to be headed down).<br />In some chapters it seemed like she had someone else writing along side of her.<br />Ms. Harris (in her remark) seemed to make it clear she did not take her fans thoughts into consideration.  The book, in my opinion, showed she felt she had her fame and monies the series generated and only wanted to fulfill her commitment of a last book.in a series she was so incredibly tired of writing.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|This is a man's movie. No. This is a man's man's movie. Wait, rather, this is a man's man's man's movie. Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins are great together. Burt the bear isn't half bad either. If you like the woods and you like movies, or even if you like movies about the woods, you'll love this movie.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|A new look at communes! It was fun and extremely well done with a look at how much fun it would have been to belong to a commune!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|When I first got my Kindle Fire, I got several games for my grandkids to play -- this one is the only one they will ask to play.  It is also a hit with my hubby!
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Every song on this cd is worth listening to over and over again. It is beautiful.  That about sums it up.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|No movement,no excitement,boring,sucks,navigation poor,subject matter sucks,a bad news app with no involvement<br />Or or or compelling characteristics to entice participant to participate.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|I really like this show a lot, I'm on the final season and am anxious to see how it all comes together in the end.
B000FBFMZ2|4.0|Good mystery, rather hard boiled and gritty. The hero is a badass (sometimes a little overly so, as his \\"conditioning\\" makes him a virtual superman) but still struggles with his conscience. A nice blend of the detective and sci-fi genres.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow some parts you really need to think about it, but the puzzles can all be done.<br />Very fun and pleasant to finish
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Love the look. Love the big numbers. It's a good free application. Quality app.  I recommend this calc app.  Get it!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I have it on my android where it is free. It's fun, but not going to pay .99 to play a game I can play for free on my android, is it worth it? Yes. It can be challenging.
B009C7JS14|1.0|I keep seeing these great reviews on this product but it isn't even accurate. We are in the beginning o  June and it told me the max. Degrees was 29. I am not a meteorologist but I know that's incorrect. After looking on the news I  proved they have no idea what they're talking about on this app.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and puzzling! It's a good game for people with good thinking skills. Sometime you have to keep looking and might get frustrated, but you have to keep trying because you just haven't found the solution. It's a great game and is great for your kindle fire.
B001974DG0|5.0|Couldn't put it down! His best work...did not want it too end.  A must read!  Read it, read it, read it!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 8 year old son loves this game so much that I have to limit his time on playing the game.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|The batteries last and are easy to change. This is the secont one I have owned and love it for small clean ups.  Thanks
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Great mic. Should do the job (I hope). Just tested it at home and looking forward to try it at next occasion.
034580709X|5.0|And what an introduction it is. Harry is one of Oslo's top police detectives on assignment in Australia to find the murderer of a Norwegian woman in Sydney. He's also a totally flawed human being with his alcoholism and impulsive reactions to solving this case with the Aussie team he works with, as he is with the women in his life. The background runs a script of the history of Australia and the treatment of the Aborigines. Crime is rampant in Sydney, as a serial killer picks off women leaving a dead-end of clues. Harry's the one the reader focuses on as he hones in on the murderer in his own driven way and makes sure justice is done.
B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|I've been wanting to read this for a while now so when it went on sale I quickly bought it. Sadly, the first chapter was doubled and I continued thinking I could live with that mistake. Then, I got into the 3rd chapter and the pages were scattered. Not worth ¢.99!
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Seems to get buggier every time I try to use it. Worked great the first six months or so, but not now.
B0020M99LC|5.0|Best chase scene every.  Great character development.  Beautiful settings.  Acting above average for a 007 movie.<br />Above average story for a James Bond movie.
B001I5M9SC|1.0|Sorry Sirs, I am not happy with this buy because I purchased by error 2 items and it was not possible to cancel despite my quick reaction.
B002WJI658|3.0|The quality on this isnt what i expected but the kids still play with it. I was expecting the item to be exactly like the one that is pictured but that is not the case, they are similar but you can tell that it is more low budget.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Thanks for delivering product on time and in good shape. I am expecting to confirm or otherwise all of the critical reviews fo this product that I have come across in the press.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app comes in handy when I need calculations  . It has many features and I love it ! I recommend it to anybody who needs calculations the results are very accurate
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The movie started off a little slow but did exceed expectations. I would suggest seeing it if you have not already.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A lot like temple run but with trains which which makes the game more difficult and fun and a very addictive game :) thumbs up
B007STXHTM|5.0|very nice case, and it works really well<br />i would buy another one if i had to<br />so get it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This could really use some demo for beginners. When I first started I had no idea what to do, so I just started tapping the screen randomly ; and that pretty much you're suppose to do! lol You tap the objects in the room to see if they are possible clues to help you escape. Some of the codes you have to figure out absolutely ridiculous! No \\"normal\\" human being would automatically be able to decipher some this stuff, so I guess I'm not so \\"normal\\" because I was able to figure some of out, that really shouldn't make sense to anyone! And I got really stump I just went to old faithful... Youtube! There actually are walkthroughs on YouTube that will show u how to get through the levels. Oh if you get stuck on level 7, you should know that the colors blocks on the floor in the second room is the key to opening the chest in the first room. If you decide to use the Youtube walk through, know that code the video maker uses may be different from yours. If so, just put in the colors as you see them laid out in the second room, but every time you see the foursquared wooden box, put in the color black : wooden box = black. All in all pretty ok game, really makes you use your noggin Lol.
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|I had the privilege to see these guys back in 2011 and they were absolutely amazing. Hands down, best show I have ever been to. Now that I own this dvd, I get to relive that moment anytime I want!
0345529057|2.0|A Game of Thrones: Amazing Book!<br />A Clash of Kings: Amazing Book!<br />A Storm of Swords: Losing a little steam, but I'm still excited!<br />A Feast for Crows:.....oh, this is going to be The Wheel of Time series again. I'm out.<br /><br />Nothing short of an utter literary tragedy. Amazing work that could have gone down as the first epic fantasy series to stand as a beacon of inspiration and hope for the genre in a long time is shamelessly sold down the river in the name of pumping our wallets as much as possible. I absolutely reject the notion that the author, who is nothing short of brilliant, just so happens to find it in the best story telling interest to drag events down to a crawl by book 4. This is the utterly shameless bilking of a franchise and any reader who can not acknowledge the drastic change is only fooling themselves (and has my sympathy). Such is Mr. Martin's prerogative, he can do as he wishes with his work, but I'll not be a part of it any further. If you can leave a story unfinished without suffering great angst, I do recommend the first two as they are really masterpieces of a dark fantasy world that breaks many stereotypes of storytelling. I might even suggest you pick up the bundle in the odd event Martin gets tired of this \\"game of book sales\\" and gets back to real storytelling. It's just terribly unfortunate to see such an obviously talented fantasy writer go down the same road as Robert Jordan. The TV show might get away with the drivel that is the 4th and 5th books in the series, but I think even that medium will find it a bitter tonic that is hard to sell. Ironically, I think at that point the more they depart from Martin's writing the better off they will be. They already have The Tudors, this just has more death, cursing and some dragons that don't do much.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|great action movie it also had a lot of heart<br />good to see the characters again<br />just the right length
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I hate this game because it takes so long to download and I was looking forward to being able to ride a horse and the people who rate this five stars are stupid and set the bar for themselves pretty low.
B007RRFUHM|4.0|I brought this CD thinking it would be like Gotye's CD.  I was pleasantly surprised by her ability to adapt to any musical genre.  I think because this was her first US album, she did play it safe and give a little bit of everything.  I do believe as she becomes more of a mainstay in the US, she will be more defined.  I do believe she has followed the way of many European/other continent artists that try to break into the US mainstream.  When Kylie Minogue first released a US CD it was nothing like the last one she released.  I can't wait for her next CD.  She has strong vocals which give her songs a magnificent emotional quality that you don't always find in today's music.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I have seen all of the ALIEN films and I still don't know what's going on. That is the charm of the whole concept. To begin with, although the ALIEN and Prometheus films look like SciFi they are actually horror movies, and very good ones. Watching a futuristic SciFi production the science and technology has to be accepted on its own terms and not equated to our everyday experience. Prometheus is good SciFi and excellent horror as well as a pretty good action film. It stands OK on its own but is very meaningful in the context of the original ALIEN shows. Many unanswered questions...are the monsters weapons? Are they meant for humans? Who are the creators and what are they trying to do? All unresolved mysteries. Prometheus cries out for the sequel that was obviously set up at the end. As in the other ALIEN stories, again we get a very strong female character.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|I really love this song.  I enjoyed the soundtrack for the first movie because of Pharrell's creativity.  The lyrics are great.  Kids and adults can get happy to it!
1451626088|5.0|One of Philippa Gregory's best efforts. Anne Neville lived a very short life, but what an impact on the British world in the 15th century and forever. A must read!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I am a huge fan of Jeff Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid series.  However, that all changed when I read this book.  I thought that it was a good idea to do a dance (considering Greg has a ton of trouble with girls), but I think that Mr. Kinney could have done a better job with this last book.<br /><br />No matter how I think of this book, I will without a doubt buy the next book(s) in this amazing saga.  Please do not let me down!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I thought it was a great app to install on my kindle fire.<br />I love it, I always play it. like every day you'll find me playing it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It took a while for me to get into this story, but great it was worth pushing through. I really enjoyed the characters and the plot. Loved the ending.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch albom did it again! Great book! I recommend it to all! It has me in tears as I just finished reading it.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|The movie was thoroughly enjoyable.  Yes, there was considerable violence so I wouldn't recommend for younger viewers but my college age daughter and I both thought it was the best movie we've seen in a long while.  I enjoyed it more than Skyfall and I am a big Bond movie fan.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This was another winner.  If you read the series, you want be disappointed.  This has your history, science, and military to keep you turning the page.  There was a surprise with what happened to some of returned characters. :)
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Hard to put down. Believable. Good character development. All age groups teens and up. Not predictable. Weaves a great story.
B009NY43NY|5.0|If it's Sookie, you've got to read it. And Eric, as the Everley Brothers would say, DREAM DREAM DREAM. Fantasy to wish upon a star for.
B007REV4T8|4.0|A good movie but they seem to get father from a story with all the special effects. Guess I'm just an old timer.
0525425772|4.0|This story shows that the role of activist may be thrust upon somebody through the actions of another.  While Theo has a great deal of sympathy for his friend's family's situation, it is the blatant animal cruelty to his dog Judge that ultimately galvanizes him to act. That he does so with creativity and the support of his friends shows that he is not one to be trifled with (nor are his friends).<br /><br />I especially like the fact that we are shown that he is very cognizant of his limits, the limits of his parents, of the system they must operate under (and it's flaws). Theo isn't a &#34;dumbed down&#34; Perry Mason wannabe. He's a very bright boy who does good things.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Everyone needs to see this Movie. Daniel is great in this part, as is true for all his parts! Buy it!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Joss Whedon demonstrated his directorial skills in this fun western sci-fi series that FOX cancelled after a few episodes.  Nathan Fillion is a favorite and does not disappoint.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is my fifth time reading this book. It never gets old and I always find something new to be amazed by. I love this book series so much that I got an Ender's Game tattoo.<br /><br />Ender's story from small child just trying to get through a school day to \\"saving\\" the human race from buggers catches my mind every time I read it.<br /><br />This time I'm reading this book to my boyfriend who hates reading and he's even captivated by it.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love the transformation that the characters go through as the garden comes to life. I find this book very inspiring.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story, excellent performances!  I love Dame Maggie Smith's portrayal of the Dowager Countess Violet Crawley.  She steals the show and provides the most subtle and delicious comic relief.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|The DVD of the show is very high quality and it is a must have for the Led Zep aficionados out there.
0553382179|5.0|This book was full of ideas and is so well written I read it through within days, and have already shared it with my mom and cousin...I plan to read it again!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is a Great Book of Classic Designs, I would like to try and build one one these, we'll see. Thank you.
0316287059|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone looking to work in a make up counter or even know how to mimic these looks for themselves creating flawless makeup on their own faces daily!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|We so enjoy all of John Grisham's Books. I read them over and over. My favorite so far is &#34;A PAINTED HOUSE&#34;.  Thank you.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a really fun and challenging game. I just wish there were more rooms to go through. Hoping for more soon. :)
B007SGM084|5.0|Great  trilogy, i hate that the story had to end, I'm really going the miss Christian and Anastasia.....I want more;)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a fun game. can't wait for the next levels!<br />I think this is a fun game. I will solve the next levels when they come out.
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|cela faisait longtemps que je voulais revoir ce film dans de bonnes conditions,c'est chose faite avec cette très belle édition!
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Great movie with a lot of historical facts in it. It portrays the good and bad of the Europeans and the Natives.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I don't normally buy instrumental cds, but I couldn't pass this one up. Great cd all around! Each song is different, and flows quite well through the tracks seamlessly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We put this on the Kindle Fire HD for our Grandaughters to play.  They love the game.  Keeps them entertained.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|Chess Free only gives you 5 minutes of playing time before declaring itself victorious. Is there anyone out there who would pay good money for such a stinker of a 'free' product?
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Love this saga. Came in a few days. Perfect for my boyfriends birthday. The case was not damaged or anything.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Was a good app but now it sucks!<br />Not even worth 1 star. Asked me to update and it fails.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Fantastic writing from a thrilling author! Simply wonderful to follow the main character, Ifemelu, through her ups and downs in Nigeria and the USA.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|If you are planning to start a business or you are already in business, it's a great book. What I like the most is the short lesson structure, to put complex ideas in a few words that you will remember.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Looks gorgeous; much better than in the pictures. I was initially worried the silver would be too dull and more of a grey look from the pictures but that is not the case. It is beautifully silver. Trust me, you will like the look of it. Everything works and it is easy to set the time and date. All for $60? Best watch deal I've seen in a long time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book! It is a great story. My original copy was stolen so I am glad I got this on my kindle!
B0059WTMLW|4.0|... and so it's a challenge! Love it! The coloring squares option is helpful as well as the pencil marks, but in the end also: the hints..!
0007477155|4.0|There are plenty to vouch for the quality of the story (its amazing), so this review is on the physical book set itself. On reading the first book the laminent started to peel off the front cover slightly where your fingers hold it. Not a huge deal but kind of annoying given this was only 2 or 3 days after receiving the set. 200 pages into book two and it started doing the same. I expect it to continue with the others as well.<br /><br />This does however seem to be the only set of all five current books that isn't covered with the HBO series adds and art (not that its bad it just wasn't original to the book series).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this set to a friend
1401937519|5.0|Life- changing for me. Personally, because I have/had &#34;incurable&#34; cancer and Anita confirms the fears in my life were the cause as they were for her. But the book is about love and is for everyone, not just the ill. It brings all the spiritual teachings I have studied together in a beautiful book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really cool! If you download it then you will get little mission and go on World Tours!:) There's also missions like finding stuff so you can get Huge Prizes!!!:) My siblings and I love this game You Should Try It!!!:)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is an enjoyable game much like temple run and subway sufers fast pace . I mostly liked the minions because they are so cute.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was amazing<br />Totally amazing.<br />I really recommend recommend this book for kids to to tell the difference from the book and the movie
B00AG297GK|3.0|This is an amusing movie, good and short so that it doesn't drag on. The humor is similar to Borat, but it is not as funny. This is also a scripted movie. Not a bad movie to watch during summer reruns.
0823015017|5.0|This is a fabulous resource for more than just polymer clay aficionados. I'm also a weaver (as well as other arts), and could have used this a long time ago for those hobbies.  The book makes color theory understandable and easily applicable. Many thanks to the authors!
B008KE3960|4.0|It's a good thought out scenario. It can be tough to get the (trail) to go exactly where you want it to go. Using the larger Kindle helps.and the levels increase in difficulty gradually.all in all a fun game.
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a masterful and gifted storyteller weaving magical worlds with real ones with deft and artistic brushstrokes, and The Ocean At The End Of The Lane is no exception. In fact, it may be his finest work to date, compressing so much into a longer form novella.<br /><br />The book is written as a semi-memoir, but most of the story points are woven from the air. The Hempstock family, who have been around the edges of some of his other works feature prominently here with their ancient farm and pond that may be an ocean.<br /><br />The story is about a 7 year old boy, but this is hardly a child's tale. This is a story written for adults looking back on their childhoods, and about how powerless we actually are as children. So, while there are hints of Coraline and Bod in here, the youngster in the story is quite helpless when things spin beyond his control. It's also about finding adults who understand what you are going through and are willing to reach out to help.<br /><br />There was much that I could relate to here. I was that child who preferred books and reading in a corner to most other activities, and whose life pursuits and passions were not the ones that his father wished him to have. So, while the book is about feeling isolated and trapped, it made me feel less alone for a while.<br /><br />The story has the feel of a half-remembered dream, and if we are lucky, that is how we remember the worst days of our lives. Like a lovely summer dream and I loved it.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|Apparently, at long last, Ivan-you-idiot is fianlly maturing, although still a bit impulsive. For me, there didn't seem to be quite the level of humorous chaos that I've come to associate with the Vorpatril's adventures, but it was still interesting, and fun to meet most of the same characters again. And there surely is chaos. I did love the sinking of the ImpSec building!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is super cute! My daughter constantly wants to &#34;do the princess make up&#34;! Fun for the two of us to work on together too.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Patiently waiting for the next book!!!GOOD book so ready for the next one. Looking forward to getting the next book
B0043KK4N6|4.0|This CD is great!  I use it to stay motivated when I work out.  Very up-tempo and the vocals are wonderful.
0718178122|5.0|This is the best book I have heard this year.<br />Having suffered through 20hours of the most appalling writing in \\"50 shades of Grey\\", I found \\"The Rosie Projects\\" to be absolutely delightful.<br />Narrated from the unique perspective of a hyper intelligent, organized to the minute and super efficient, genetics professor, who hopelessly lacks social skills, it's funny, intelligent and cleverly written.<br /><br />To resolve his issue of not having a partner, Don Tillman comes up with an idea of \\"The wife project\\" - extremely detailed 16 page questioner which will help him eliminate the `unsuitable women' (the vegans, smokers, the sports watchers, scientifically illiterate etc)<br />His methodical plan turns upside down, when he meets Rosie and finds himself having `tremendously good' time with her even though she is \\"the most unsuitable wife candidate\\".<br /><br />The story is Romantic but without being cheesy and funny without being stupid.<br />It's a rare Intelligent Romantic Story - something of the sorts of \\"As good as it gets\\" or \\"Closer\\"<br />I do hope it will make it into a film some day. I would love to see Nathalie Portman as Rosie and perhaps Ewan McGregor as Don?
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Better than th  other temple run games so far. Plus you can play in different worlds. So much fun and addictive. Wish there was more characters to play as though.
B00A8KJK7G|3.0|I bought this DVD so my daughter could play it anytime she wanted on her DVD player in her room.  We planned to watch it in our family room, on the Blu-ray/DVD player first.  However, several attempts to get it to play only resulted in it getting stuck in the player.  Other DVDs work in it.  Fortunately, we tried it in another DVD player, and it worked.<br />My  12 yr-old daughter laughed a few times.  Another Tim Burton success.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game can be a mindbender but when I can't get it right,  I just leave it for awhile and come back and try it again.  Very fun game and for those who love scavenger hunts or finding clues to get to the end result........this is the game for you!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Kills time,but I've seen better in this genre of game.  Good thing it was free, I would not pay for it.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Have the new iMac with only USB 3 and Thunderbolt port but have several FireWire external hard drives. This adapter, made by Apple, does what it supposed to do.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun, addcitive game that keeps you thinking. The only thing is that its over at level 8 and you can get through it in about an hour.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|fun game but takes a while to get into and can be glitchy with occasional crashing and loss of ranking for no reason but still addictive
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME...SIMPLY GREAT.  Would appreciate more games like this one.<br />Hours of beautiful adventures.  Played it once before and just had to buy it.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Awesome album.  Nailed it with songs and lyrics.  (My heart is like a stallion, you love it more when it's broken).  They still got it!
B005GIS1WA|4.0|This was entertaining for all members of the family. My daughter found it funny in some places. I felt it was a safe movie for everyone.
B000PC0U1W|3.0|...hoping to find its redemption. Didn't. But one viewers disappointment is another's viewers delight. Acting was superb (english actors usually are) but I found the script lame. Reminded me of of a psycho on steriods version of the Joker in Batman...just less credible. For the low price it's still slightly more curiously strange than most tv shows on cable. I suspect teens might enjoy it the most.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I like how they put American and Russian gun in this game.and I like how you can zoom in and out of the gun
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I started reading this book last night to help me fall asleep...it's now 2:45am! I couldn't stop reading this fun chick lit escape! My only gripe is that it ended too soon!
B00C81LYH2|5.0|Barbie Collector 2013 Holiday Doll, Blonde<br /><br />The Barbie Collector 2013 Holiday Doll looks absolutely stunning in her bright silver gown covered with snow white lacy snowflakes and a bit of white - silky - tulle fluffed around the waist. A single trail of lace snowflakes gently wind up the bodice toward the gown's shoulder strap and a single snowflake adorns it.  The other silver shoulder strap is bare.<br /><br />Nails and lips are a bright (shiny) fuchsia color. Eyes are very life-like and makeup is modern.  (eyeliner, shadow, highlighter) are immaculate, and not too heavy looking. Long eyelashes and brows are also painted on.<br /><br />Modernly styled hair is rooted into scalp and very thick, long, soft and shiny.<br /><br />Earrings are large and captivating -- , a fashion statement that says \\"Hey, Look at Me\\". :)<br /><br />There is also a little display stand inside the box.<br /><br />This is the only Collector Barbie Doll I own, and love it! 'nuf said! :)<br /><br />Does the Barbie Collector 2013 Holiday Doll sound like what you may be looking for? :)  ...a Fantastic Gift idea! I'm just saying...  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I like that this book focuses more on how the world reacted to the zombie attack than actually on the zombies. I usually only read it when I am feeding my baby so it can be hard to remember who he is interviewing with the way the book is formatted. I wish the movie had been more like the book.
1616550414|3.0|Perhaps I should have read the description more thoroughly before purchasing.  But &#34;Hyrule Historia&#34; already me sold!  I was expecting a history of the world of Hyrule and the incarnations of Link and Zelda, but this is more a history of the games itself with a sort of glossary of the various characters and enemies.  It's a beautiful book, don't get me wrong, it's just not what I was expecting.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|Very sad but captivating book. I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to others. One of those books that stays with you after you finish it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loves puzzles&hellip; this game keeps you thinking.  good for exercising you brain.<br />something for all ages. my 5 year old is helping to remember colors and patterns.
1400049628|3.0|This was not as good as WWZ.  A lot of the information in this book is laughably incorrect.  As an infantryman in the U.S. army who holds degrees in military history and ballistics, I recommend ignoring the section on firearms completely.  Anyone who knows Newton's second law of motion should be able to explain why shotguns will not \\"send several zombies sprawling.\\"  I would love to see the crossbow that can hit a head sized target from \\"a quarter mile.\\" And who (that has shot a gun) recommends bolt action over semi-automatic?  (Those are just a few of the more glaring mistakes.)  Also (just asking), if the fastest zombie ever took \\"one step every 1.5 seconds,\\" how is this a threat?  The zombies are coming! Stroll for your life!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|i liked this game alot but if theres one thing i dont like its that you never level up. some people might like that.also i bought it as the free app of the day. i dont think i would spend real money on it.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|I was a little disappointed with the song selections on this CD.  I still love Michael Buble, his voice is one of a kind.<br />I think maybe I was spoiled by previous CD's from Michael.  For me this one did not do it.
B00371V918|5.0|Another good story by Nicholas Sparks. What I liked about the book is how eventually John stands out amid a series of circumstances that are against his pursuit of happiness. You can't put it down.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I enjoyed this game but felt it was priced too high for the time it takes to complete. However, I would recommend this game to a friend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it!  very tricky but in a good way!  not too easy but not impossible  keep going  once you start you cant stop  very addicting
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Can't stop playing with this app...Really love it!  My kids like it as well, we had fun making designs together. Great FAOTD!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|4 yr old loves to play this one. clear graphics and easy to use. its a  pretty cute game for kids.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Thats it? Have been eagerly waiting each new release and the build up of this final book was keeping me up at night. Got it. Read it. Was disappointed. There was no major plot twist. Not really enough closure to call it an ending either. Worth it just to see how it ends but don't get your hopes up.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Pixar really knew how to end this series. This was an awesome movie all around; for the kids and adults!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Took this on vacation for a relaxing read on the beach. Could not leave the room because the phone kindle reader needed a charge so I can read it.<br /><br />Yes, better than the movie. The book digs deep into the characters and you really get a feel for what's going on with the main character and the politics. I'm not a fan of anything politics but this gives just enough to make it interesting with out being preachy.
B005COO1X6|4.0|The characters and the settings are so well developed that I felt as if I was living the story through them. I was a Maine native for my first 52 years, and I was part of the Maine Turnpike original construction, so I could also identify with the location. As usual, Stephen King's characterizations, and geographical details of Maine are so good that they bring on a tinge of homesickness to me (I now live in San Diego).
B0060Q57JW|4.0|I have not been able to view each item but it has been received which is a good thing. It will probable be winter before I get a chance to view all 10 seasons only then will I know if all is okay. I was not able to watch the shows on TV except a couple of them and then found out it has been playing for 10 seasons that just goes to show you that I live my life but not through the TV.
0810989956|5.0|My daughter loves it. Since she received it she had been carrying it around everywhere and it really keeps her interested.
B00B37ET42|2.0|This is probably a worthwhile read, but I found the language and sentence structure difficult to read.  It took way too long to develop into a story.  I didn't finish it.
0345479092|5.0|I don't even have kids yet and I've read this twice. Easy read, fantastic info, realistic approach. She is very balanced and her conversational writing style is great.
