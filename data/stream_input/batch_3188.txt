B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This is the best TV series I've ever watched.  Not the best of the seasons but riveting and worth watching.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Don't EVEN think this film will hold a candle to or touch Judy Garland's OZ!  But that said, it's a fun film, funny, and enjoyable as it's own take as a prequel.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|Funny and fresh.  Great story, easy to follow.  Refreshingly different then recent comedies.  Love the chemistry - just a good, funny movie.

B002BE7JE8|4.0|The \\"chills come thick and fast\\" as voodoo and terror meet within an innocent-looking doll named \\"Chucky\\" inhabited by the soul of a serial killer who isn't ready to die. From the Director of Fright Night comes a \\"clever, playful\\" (The New York Times) and stylish thriller with \\"excellent special effects\\" (Leonard Maltin) and heart-pounding suspense guaranteed to scare!<br /><br />After 6-year-old Andy Barclay's (Alex Vincent) babysitter Maggie is violently pushed out of a window to her death, nobody believes him when he says that \\"Chucky,\\" his new birthday doll, did it! Until things start going terribly wrong dead wrong. And when an ensuing rampage of gruesome murders lead Chicago Police Detective Michael Norris(Chris Sarandon) back to the same toy, he discovers that the real terror has just begun. The deranged doll has plans to transfer his evil spirit into a living human being young Andy after notorious \\"Lakeshore Strangler\\" Charles Lee Ray(Brad Dourif)transfers his soul by voodoo magic into a Cabbage Patch like \\"Good Guy\\" doll after being shot near to death by Chicago P.D. where Charles presumably burned to death in the toy store explosion which was similar to how the wicked murderous Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund)preyed on his victims after being burned alive to a crisp by enemies who presumed him to be dead in the original Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET which was released in the Fall of 1984.<br /><br />Eventually, Chucky discovers from a witch doctor John Simonsen \\"Dr. Death\\"(Raymond Oliver)that the only way he can get out of the dolls body is to possess the first person he revealed his secret to which is Andy whom Chucky desperately stalks the more Chucky becomes human & trapped in the doll the longer he stays in it.<br /><br />CHILD'S PLAY was also released in the Fall of 1988 with moderate success that was produced on a 9,000,000 budget & has now since developed a cult following among fans of the horror genre just like HALLOWEEN, A NIGHTMARE ON ELMSTREET, FRIDAY THE 13TH, etc. along with the fact that \\"Chucky\\" was the most relentless villainous murderer since Freddy Krueger & CHILD'S PLAY did so well during it's theatrical release in November of 1988 that CHILD'S PLAY II came out in theatres in the Fall of 1990 which wasn't too shabby of a sequel in fact.<br /><br />Rumor also has it that the \\"Good Guy Dolls\\" were based on the My Buddy dolls created by Hasbro, but it was confirmed by creator Don Mancini that the \\"Good Guy Dolls\\" were modeled after the Cabbage Patch Kids, plus there were a large crowd of people protesting against this horror flick speculating that it would incite violence in children.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I will read this book again and, probably, again.  one reading doesn't begin to open up the many nuances of this story, this character.  This is a rich and moving tale of a boy/man who is tragic and vulnerable yet one who has all he needs to find love and happiness if only he could stop &#34;living&#34; long enough to recognize himself.

B004ADH1RI|1.0|No idea why others enjoy it so much, and I have no idea why it would be PG. I certainly didn't consider some of the subject references (e.g.: sexual torture chambers, using the rear view mirror to look down her shirt, ...) something I thought my young kids were ready to be hearing, though I guess it passed over their heads. I thought the humor was generally unsophisticated and slightly vulgar (not too bad, but not too good either) and I can see why teen kids would like it but not parents nor younger kids. I turned it off after about an hour and my kids did not object at all.<br /><br />I watched it on prime and the sound quality was poor and hard to understand, but I'm not sure if that was prime or the movie, as this was the first prime film I had watched.

B008JFUNJQ|3.0|PG-13 Review. If adult language insults your well being - please stop now. Not being funny - I mean, stop reading.<br /><br />Never read Orson Scott Card. Never heard of 'Ender's Game' until this movie was produced. I want that clear before anyone continues on and reads this review. If those two criteria are relevant to you - then, again, stop now. Additionally, I don't have a stake one way or another whether this film succeeds or fails. Like the 'Hunger Games' franchise, I can only review what was presented.<br /><br />Tells the story of Ender Wiggin, cadet in training for our combat forces and a potential leader in the making. Growing up in a world where Earth was nearly conquered by an invading species from another planet, it's discovered that only the young have the mental ability to effectively manage the vast interconnected network of automated defense drones. Is he the leader that the training command believes will finally deliver victory? Tested and pushed, Ender, rather quickly, moves from unsure youngster to confident and disciplined digital warrior. Yet, something is definitely amiss. Are his vivid recurring dreams more than just visualizations of missed family?<br /><br />An okay flick.<br /><br />Young actors, especially recently, have been notoriously miscast. Chosen by committee rather than honesty; fully developed on-screen characterization a skill that is seemingly not a requirement to be selected for the lead role anymore. Does anyone still think Hayden Christensen did a great job for Lucas? But let's give credit where it's due. Asa Butterfield pulled off his role with conviction, delivering a believable portrayal as the 'chosen one', the young person destined to lead humanity to victory over our dread enemies.<br /><br />But suppose grandpa and his wrinkly bald buddy just didn't \\"get it\\"? What if the gray ones didn't \\"understand\\" the true nature of the battlefield?<br /><br />This crucial plot element struck me as sycophantic and insulting. Very much a marketing department's wet dream. The salvation of humanity turns out to be a bunch of teenage kids who play video games. And simultaneously making out the older folks as inept and morally blind.<br /><br />Really? &lt;smh><br /><br />Talk about pandering to one's target market. Shamelessly stroking a very specific audience with a very specific message: Old People Need Not Apply. You gray ones can't operate a computer, don't know how to write code, and you certainly can't sit on your backside for endless hours grasping and playing with one's joystick. (Yes, I know, it's a \\"controller\\". But my snark wouldn't have worked as well.&lt;g>)<br /><br />Y-Gen Americans already have a rather warped sense of the world. And how our elders are treated, or mistreated as in this case, is par for the course in this pathetic brave new world.<br /><br />In an irony worthy of a movie itself, whom can we thank for this freakish existence? The Baby Boomers. Those arrogant self-important jackasses that first posited, then reveled, in this ridiculously moronic belief system: \\"Don't Trust Anyone Over 30\\".<br /><br />Thanx Hippies. Payback is a bleep ain't it?<br /><br />Overall, a decent movie with a typical slate of special effects to help offset the incredibly patronizing, shallow screenplay. And my interpretation has always been, if a production 'needs' special effects to make the film ready for consumption - then it's already a failure. In essence, no point with the gravy if the meat is no good.<br /><br />There was real potential here, a chance to really explore and celebrate the concept of youth overcoming perceived limitations; to give the young the chance to be something more than a clich&eacute;. But the filmmakers blew it in favor of a tired boilerplate of a plot that's been done more times than Madonna has been mounted.<br /><br />Screenplay - One. Acting - Four. SFX - Three.<br /><br />Overall - 3 stars.<br /><br />Movie Recommendation:<br /><br />- While this recommendation is nothing like 'Ender's Game' - check out this indie from the UK - '[[ASIN:B005J4TLN4 Attack the Block]]'. A movie that addresses disreputable and broken youngsters who, when given a proper challenge, find their own footing in a way that was both fascinating and entertaining.ing like 'Ender's Game' - check out this indie from the UK - '[[ASIN:B005J4TLN4 Attack the Block]]'.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a pretty fun little game. I like it but it does get confusing from time to time but that is what makes it fun!
B008JFUS5A|5.0|Now *this* is what I was expecting when I screened that first film.<br /><br />Again, until that first installment, I had never heard of the term, the author, the rabid fans - none of it. What the movie presented was all that I had to judge. And I was so sorely disappointed. All that hyperbole had raised my expectation something akin to cinematic tumescence. Energy wasted.<br /><br />Not that I was only seeking bloodshed, but let's be bluntly honest here and say 'Hunger Games' was an insipid powderpuff of a film. I half expected a bunch of vendors outside the theater hawking t-shirts and toy figurines to the kiddies. One of the films I recommended in my original review in the hopes that future installments of the franchise would achieve a similar experience was '[[ASIN:B000WUBVKQ The Condemned]]' - a digital Roman Colosseum with brutal games of death for the sick pleasure of the anonymous multitude. My fears for the second installment, thankfully, was put to rest quickly. This was an exponential improvement. Going way beyond some marginal refinement by touching up the corners of an already weak product.<br /><br />Gary Ross left the project or was shown the door - either way - I'm terribly grateful.<br /><br />The new filmmakers exceeded my limited expectations.<br /><br />Simultaneously - and in true '[[ASIN:B002WCFT0K Rollerball]]' fashion - exposing the social plague that is \\"cultural popularity\\" and the hidden manipulation by the elites as they use entertainment to divert, distract and appease the unruly angry masses. In case you missed it - that's you, me, and all the other 99% regular folk. It's important to remember the elite's mantra for centuries has been:<br /><br />\\"Keep them occupied with bread and circuses.\\"<br /><br />As the powerful have unhappily discovered that Katniss' popularity is working against their purpose, they have decided to break her the same way they made her - by way of the games. And despite promises of a life carefree of such demands, the establishment has devised a twist to bring back past victors in a battle royal. This time no pair will emerge - one lone survivor will be crowned all-time champion. And Katniss Everdeen cannot and will not be that champion. Designed specifically to break her spirit, and by association, the spirit of the people who have discovered in her their own long suppressed voice screaming for freedom.<br /><br />And we finally get to see the actress who won the Academy Award at age 22. Jennifer delivered a superlative performance as the district youngster growing up much too soon. The long dark shadow that one carries inside as one murders a way to false fame and fortune. Katniss finally having to deal with the reality that she killed other children. The true price of her survival now eating away at her soul.<br /><br />Further, by showcasing the revolting clownish existence of Celebrity - a pathetic new world made acceptable by empty-headed twits like the Kardashians and their reality-tv ilk; finally exposing that world for the whorish fame-seeking lifestyle it is. Sadly, unlike this fictional vision, has already infected the current and upcoming generation of Americans. &lt;smh><br /><br />Yes, this is the movie I was hoping for.<br /><br />Finally, given the processed pre-digested PowerPoint presentation of the first film, I had no choice but to dismiss Josh Hutcherson as nothing more than a juvenile automaton; a walking, talking cardboard cut-out. But Director Francis Lawrence gave the young man an actual role to fill; a real performance to execute. And he did so with adroitness. Ditto Elizabeth Banks who, in a few scant scenes, revealed a depth of character and thespian skill peering beyond the garish pancake. A pair of unexpected pleasant surprises to go along with with so many other wonderful elements found in this exceptional sequel.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really, really pleased. It gives one hope that some executive producers are not completely self-involved intheir own navels; the ability see things honestly - without consulting lying marketing departments and their pimps - where things have gone wrong and having the proper insight on how to fix the problem is a very rare thing in cinema.<br /><br />Internally debated this movie review for several days, but I'm now comfortable to defend = five stars.<br /><br />Personal Note:<br /><br />- This is what comes of finding the right director for a project. Not just name-branding or submitting to the rantings of the internet mob - but strength of will to do the right thing. Replacing Gary Ross was a game changer - and the absolute right thing. Francis Lawrence captured, what I understand from perusing forums where hardcore fans congregate, what the Games are truly about; he understood what the writer was attempting. A decisive cleave at the poorer functionary to find the right vision in the right hands of the right creative helm.<br /><br />And this is a perfect example of why I give Disney Corp and their subsidiary Marvel Entertainment such a look of incredulity. You have two major winning franchises in 'Iron Man' and 'Thor'. So what do you do? Change directors and produce infinitely less enjoyable films. Why?<br /><br />Stealing defeat from the jaws of victory.<br /><br />What business school did those morons attend? They could learn something from the Hunger Games team.ir own navels; the ability see things honestly - without consulting lying marketing departments and their pimps - where things have gone wrong and having the proper insight on how to fix the problem is a very rare thing in cinema.<br /><br />Internally debated this movie review for several days, but I'm now comfortable to defend = five stars.<br /><br />Personal Note:<br /><br />- This is what comes of finding the right director for a project.

0316228583|1.0|I did not read the HP series, but had high hopes for work by the author.  I found J.K. Rowling's writing to be just on the edge of very good.  But, she is much too good of an author to have to resort to profanity.  The story might have held my interest, but the profanity was mis-placed and unnecessary to the story or the characters.  I didn't finish the book simply because it didn't hold my interest.  I do believe this author can do better, much better.
B005USZYDU|5.0|What a terrific opener book for the Theodore Boone series. I read all four books and was looking for more of the thirteen year old. I can hardly wait when he is eighteen and passing the bar exam.
B00E59ZROG|4.0|I keep swearing that I'll never buy another complete set of the Beethoven symphonies, and I can't even remember how I talked myself into buying this one, but when it came and I opened it and started listening I realized I'd found something quite enjoyable.  These aren't great performances in the Furtwangler or Klemperer class but the sound is better, the performances are strong and characterful, and it's probably the best set of old style Germanic tradition Beethoven in good early stereo that I've ever heard.  Something in the class of Gunter Wand's recordings but a bit cheaper and a bit more interesting.<br />These recordings have been languishing in separate multi-CD packs for some time and are now brought together in paper sleeves into a nice compact box with a small booklet providing basic information.  No sign that there's been any remastering but the sound is fine anyway.  A good buy for LvB collectors and an affordable starter set for Beethoven newbies.

0553384775|2.0|Disappointed in this book.  The time frame focuses on the collapse of Belfort's trading firm and his drug use.  I would have liked to know more about how he started his firm and how he got it to be so big.  That is completely skipped over. The book starts with a description of his first day as a &#34;connector&#34; working for another firm and skips about 6 years into the future.  I'm hoping the movie brings that into the story.  On a side note, t is difficult to see how anyone would have survived the amount of drugs that Belfort claims to have taken.

0399246665|2.0|the books are divided. The top half is a color or shape and the bottom half is its partner. It is annoying having to search through the book to find what you are looking for.

B008JFUPOY|4.0|Mike and Sulley weren’t always best buds and Disney’s Monsters University tells the story of how their friendship came to be so strong. It’s a classic weak-unite-to-beat-the-strong storyline loaded with laughs and a few heartfelt moments.<br /><br />Similar to the first movie, Monsters University had a message that friends can accomplish more together than alone. Mike and Sulley find themselves relying on each other and a group of misfits for a chance to stay in the scare program. The movie also teaches kids to look past the exterior and see that some of the people we are prone to overlook are capable of the unexpected. You’ll also find a message about honesty and resisting the urge to win at all costs.<br /><br />Storyline<br />Ever since college-bound Mike Wazowski (voice of Billy Crystal) was a little monster, he has dreamed of becoming a professional Scarer—and he knows better than anyone that the best Scarers come from Monsters University (MU). But during his first semester at MU, Mike’s plans are derailed when he crosses paths with hotshot MU legacy James P. Sullivan, “Sulley” (voice of John Goodman), a natural-born Scarer. The pair’s out-of-control competitive spirit gets them both kicked out of the University’s elite Scare Program. To make matters worse, they realize they will have to work together, along with an odd bunch of misfit monsters, if they ever hope to make things right.<br /><br />Overall<br />If you liked Monsters Inc. you will enjoy this follow up. While Cars 2 seemed to diverge from the tone set in Cars (i.e., cars shooting at each other, impossible-for-kids-to-solve mystery element), Monster’s University stays true to the spirit of Monsters Inc. I will say I was a bit nervous though when Mike and Sulley found themselves walking into a party at a frat house, but the scene didn’t feature any of the college shenanigans that you might expect. Monsters walked around with the “red cups” and I recall seeing one monster taking a fall from too much to drink but that was about it.<br /><br />My 5 year old son loved Monsters University. It’s practically all he’s talked about since we saw it. He’s been developing his own movie with some of the characters from MU and a few of his own creations. We are, however, having a hard time explaining to him why we won’t be able to get the same people to do the voices for Mike and Sulley. (We don’t have those kinds of connections…yet alone that much money.)<br /><br />This was a great family movie.king a fall from too much to drink but that was about it.<br /><br />My 5 year old son loved Monsters University.

B00BEIYMTW|3.0|The creators of Disney’s Cars took to the air this past summer with Disney’s Planes. While Cars is heavy on sentiment and story line, Planes soars with action and fun. The movie wastes no time getting into the action as it opens with the eye-popping race sequence.<br /><br />There’s no time for your kids’ attentions to drift with this one. In no time Dusty Crophopper goes from daydreaming Midwesterner to headline-grabbing aerial racer. Where the movie lacks in overall humor it makes up for in high-intensity action and fast-paced storytelling.<br /><br />Storyline<br />From above the world of “Cars” comes “Disney’s Planes,” an action-packed 3D animated comedy adventure featuring Dusty (voice of Dane Cook), a plane with dreams of competing as a high-flying air racer. But Dusty’s not exactly built for racing—and he happens to be afraid of heights. So he turns to a seasoned naval aviator who helps Dusty qualify to take the defending champ of the race circuit. Dusty’s courage is put to the ultimate test as he aims to reach heights he never dreamed possible, giving a spellbound world the inspiration to soar.<br /><br />Overall<br />Disney’s Planes, like its predecessors, has some positive underlying themes. Your kids will learn about teamwork, overcoming your fears, not settling for less than your best and putting others above your own pursuits. There are a few phrases that you might find mildly objectionable, but I think they’ll go over most kids’ heads.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Great read! Immediately captured my interest, characters are connected, plot grabs you from the beginning, and never let's you go - all the way through!  Grisham delivers the punches as always!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I found this book quite accidentally, and let me tell you, it is wonderful. From the very beginning it captivated my attention in a way that books don't often do. It is different from anything I have read before; it's fresh and imaginative, yet real, and I highly recommend it to everyone, especially those who were in a book slump like me!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I purchased this from one of those \\"big box\\" stores a couple of years ago to use with my xbo.  However, I now mainly use this for general entertainment purposes (TV, Movies, Computer).  The sound on this is amazing.  You can really hear every detail no matter the application.  HELPFUL TIP: to easily switch the input device, I would suggest buying an optical bi directional switch like this one from amazon:  [[ASIN:B002L2V8VK Toslink Optical Bi Directional Switch Playstation 3]]  HELPFUL TIP 2: Buy recharge batteries and a recharger.  I have to replace my batteries at least once a week, probably because I like to listen to music on full blast.<br /><br />The only downsides to the headset are:<br />-Limited Range. Spotty reception thru multiple walls, different floors<br />-RF interference when i use my microwave.<br />-Batteries sometimes come loose when I'm jammin out

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good read. Ending abrupt. More detailed ending would have been better. Love John Grisham tho. I think that is all
B00BAXFECK|5.0|A long book and (while a very overused description) truly Dickensian.  I got very involved with the story in the beginning through Theo's eyes and experiences.  I loved spending time in the worlds of painting and antique restoration -- I could almost smell the workshop. I would have loved to join some of the New York characters at a dinner party! I was alarmed to see Theo descend (spoiler alert) into  deception, drugs, and a relationship of compromise.  This book is for those who can relate to loving beautiful art. It will require an investment of time to get through the 800+ pages - but it's worth the effort. I especially love how the author resolved the central issue of the story regarding the painting. I will read more Donna Tartt based on this book.

If you are wanting to open your mind to the world of Japan, I think this movie is a great start. I went through so many emotions throughout the movie ranging from utter happiness to my heart strings being tugged. It is gentle and beautiful and reminds you that deep inside we are all the same. The men in my life like it too! Definitely does not focus on the love story aspect, as it focuses on trails we face throughout life. This is a movie I can watch time and time again!

B0057R5XRG|5.0|I love this collection! The picture quality and sound is so epic on system. The digital copies are a great bonus. I added them on my VUDU account and now i can share them with other family members
B004NIFK9Q|5.0|A classic. Takes you on an inside look at old fashioned ideas about class and how they relate to each other and the world. Of course, we would all like to think class distinctions are obsolete, but in fact, they still exist in our consciousness. This book forces us to read and try to understand each view we have of each other, and it is a valuable lesson to us all.<br />Read the book to see the movie, if you already have seen it. Enjoy it for itself alone, you may see a part of yourself to remedy or admire.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The box is so clean and much better up close in person. Also the movies themselves are protected in thick pages making it feel just like a book.
B00GLX1MG6|1.0|Language was so bad if the beginning of  movie that we would not watch it.  We wasted a movie rental.  The movie was supposed to be a comedy,but I have not laughed yet!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I liked this book because is about the hard life if a little boy that looks different from us. Also i like how the book is written in several perspectives. I would recommend this book to any body in 5th grade. I rated this book a five because i was very intrigued and i would definitely like Wonder to become a series.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Very historic. Maybe a little too graphic on some scenes but it keeps your interest and you just want to see more.
B002UWH8P6|1.0|Too much attention placed two male type major characters. I sick of them by the end of the season. Needed more plits
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I was captivated by the relationship between Lou and Will - how each of them, in the end, set the other one free. The moral question of euthanasia is complicated, yet very evermore relevant as regards our aging population.<br />There is a lot to think about in this book and I highly recommend it as a book club selection.
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|Most families have a story about a relative taking advantage of a will or elderly relative.<br />Some thing never change. If a family says they get along their lying.
B00124DSR0|4.0|A great album for it's time. Because of radio over play of a few of the tracks I don't enjoy the album as often or as much as I used to but there are some great tracks.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|I hate it I can't tell you how much I hate it! It was all blotchy as nd slow and it didn't even let me edit my photos never buy it
B008602KQI|5.0|A great escape from reality.  It really draws you in to the world presented and is interesting from start to finish.
0385537131|4.0|Somewhere along the line I became disenchanted with Grisham's books but I picked up this one because it's a sequel to A Time to Kill.  I really enjoyed it very much, so much so that I plan to read A Time to Kill again as well as some of his other books I missed.  Highly recommended.
B003B02O0A|4.0|A good read with an expected ending. The South has come along way in the past 50 years but there was a time.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I loved it so much I couldn't stop playing. I played and played and played all night and day with my kindle
B0034G4P80|4.0|Good movie.  It definitely kept pace with the first Captain America and at least one of the Iron Man movies.  I originally hadn't wanted to see it, but just HAD to catch it after the Avengers, especially knowing I'd like to see the 2nd Thor movie that's out now.  It had action and humor & I was very please with the movie.  I'd certainly recommend it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|l wanted to see how much battery l had left and it is excellent and l am pleased with it.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I thought that it was Bad but I was so wrong I mean like it took me only one day and I got a six pack!
1579655327|5.0|I read some of the other ratings and was concerned about buying it but after I received it I realized people do not do research before buying items.  If you are familiar with Kinfolk magazine then you will &#34;get&#34; this cookbook.  It is not just about the recipes.  It is about the recipes, the stories behind the dishes and the photos.  It is their magazine in a bigger book.  I LOVE it.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|I have been a fan Bruce Willis for many years. strangely, when he had the television series I did not like him and the character he played.  However, after seeing the numerous movies he has played in I got to really like him.  Action movies is what he does best and the character (John McClane), who is a New York Cop, was made for Bruce Willis in the same way the Conan the Barbarian series was made for Arnold S.<br /><br />This story is about a ruthless criminal who is a computer genius, as well as being a lunatic psychopath.  He attacks society by using his computer skills to shut down the city and threatens to shut down the country if his demands are not met.  There are many twists and turns in this movie as John McClane again defeats the criminals using his wits and imagination, along with his guns of course, in this action packed movie. This DVD has both the theatrical version and the unrated version of this 129 minute film.  If you are a fan of Bruce Willis and John McClane you should check out this DVD.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale  (Author: Predator Hunter: A warrior's memoir)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game, cool graphics and plays very smoothly. The overall idea for the game was creative and my son loves playing it.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I'm joining the voices asking for this app to be made available on the Kindle Fire. Jeff Bezos was on TV today saying his number one goal is customer loyalty. I've been considering upgrading to a larger tablet for some time, and now it seems if I do so it will have to something that will support this app......definetly not a Kindle Fire I guess. Does anyone have an answer as to why it's taking so long?
B0055SWM08|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this game, but it is so much fun and becoming addicted to to it!! No problems with the app and runs very smooth!! Give it a try. It has lots of challenges so it doesn't get boring!
B00005QGAV|5.0|love Micheal Jackson his DVD's are the best I try to have all of them if you can get them you should he is a singer every person should have on in there collection.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|These were needed for co-workers that had special needs and they worked just great! They were able to lower their monitors to an angle that worked better for them.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|Great singer could listen to his music all day would buy more of his DVD's keep them coming Justin Bieber
B0063M22QO|5.0|Enjoyable Mahjong game.  Lots of interesting confugurations. Nice way to pass the time while waiting for appointments, etc. --- ---
B00005QGAT|5.0|love Micheal Jackson his DVD's are the best I try to have all of them if you can get them you should he is a singer every person should have on in there collection.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Very well designed free-cell game. Works well, attractive graphics. My wife loves this version as well. Downloadedd it to her tablet as well as my Kindle Fire.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|love Micheal Jackson his DVD's are the best I try to have all of them if you can get them you should he is a singer every person should have on in there collection.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Now that the Weather Channel has redesigned its interface and teamed up with some points reward app it is less convenient to use and constantly shilling for the points thing.<br />I am not real good at finding unnamed menus. It took me weeks to find sunrise/ sunset hidden under the current temperature.<br />I have downloaded 2 apps for the points thing and after 2 weeks have not 'earned' my $1 Amazon gift card. What's really annoying is that I live in a small town and the check in app 'powered by Foursquare' can't find ANYTHING closer than 20 miles of me, which leaves out a Subway sandwiches in town and a Kroger, a McDonald's and a Hardy's in the town I visit most frequently. I liked TWC better as a stand alone with the info I want 'on top' instead of a pretty part of an annoying suite.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Love this singer I have all his DVD's and will keep on buying them keep them coming Adam you are the best
B001HM1PFO|5.0|This is a classic! I haven't seen it for years but when I saw it on DVD I just had to get it. You definitely need to get this if you are a Tim Curry fan.
B007HO392S|5.0|Love her music she is such a great singer will keep buying her music keep them on coming Carrie Underwood
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Keeps you turning the pages - hard to put the book down.  I will be looking for more Will Robie books in the future.
0061998494|5.0|Love-Love-Love-Craig Ferguson!  He is just as funny in print as he is on his late night talk show! If you are a Craig Ferguson fan and like biographies you'll like this book! I Highly Recommend this book!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|IF you have kids is a kind of movie that you probably would only see once of a time but I still love it...
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|A great app so fun I am fascinated by the graphics sometimes it locks up bot is a good game . Love it
B00571F26Y|5.0|Evidence, and not mere opinions, drives the ideas in this book. I have lost 16 pounds in two weeks by just not eating wheat. Now I know why. I had a wheat belly! And now, no more!!
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I purchased this book but immediately returned it when I saw the references to Newtown.  Completely inappropriate!  I am having a difficult time with those who can justify it, but each person has his /her own opinion.  I was starting to feel like the only person upset with those references.  Glad to see others speaking out about them as well.
B00GX50ZC4|1.0|Absolutely terrible movie with no plot, no twists and an incredibly bland acting job by Ashton Kutcher. I would pay another $6 to get the 2 hours of my life back that I wasted.
B00EJGMCG6|5.0|The best live album Testament has done since live at the filmore. Highly recommended if you are a true testament fan.
0374531269|4.0|School book requirement.  Om mandatory reading list. Interesting read not sure would've read it without requirement but glad we did.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I love this book. It is gritty and honest and shows a real depth of understanding of the characters and issue of living in a small community. As a high school teacher I can say that Rowling &#34;gets&#34; young people - a rare thing these days as our adolescents are so rapidly changing. She has shown a depth and breadth to her writing that consolidates her position as a genuine and serious author. A great read - extremely well written.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Enjoy it, but after getting a good ways into the game, it started over for no reason. Lost all my progress.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love playing a Star Wars themed Angry Birds, it helps pass the time. Everyone in the family loves to play it.
B00BMQDM10|5.0|I really love Kinsella's books, and felt that the few latest ones were a bit disappointing. Wedding night however is a fun read, and reminded my the Undomestic Goddess and Can You Keep a Secret which are my favourites. It's funny, and the characters are really fun to be with. Enjoyed this book very much.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I selected this books to read to my son's, ages 6 and 8.  However, I started reading it first and just couldn't put it down. It was a quick read but made me both laugh out loud and tear up at various parts. Although the ending was a bit predictable, I think this is going to be a great book to share with my kids and will be a good way to discuss a lot of things like what it means to be kind, the true meaning of friendship and to think about life from other people's perspective.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Luckely I Had taken a really short course before were I learned certain things that did not here. I like it because its a fun way to learn, but personaly, when I get a wrong answer, there is no explanation as to why my answer was wrong. Other than that, I like it, and its cool because I also have it in my cell.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Thought I could do more, very disappointing. Not good for streaming anything other than youtube or netflix. Does not work on tablet version of google chrome.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|Five stars if you can help me connect to Facebook. Please help other than that this game is very addicting
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I played candy crust saga on my phone. Now I got a kindle fire hd. It won't download so I can't play it on here. I get want it bigger and better. That's y I give it a 3 out of 5.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|Good story and pretty good clarity and graphics..but I've seen better. Two things though that were annoying...several screens too dark to see well enough and lag time between scenes worsened after I paid to unlock the whole game. Free part was fairly long enough to get u hooked to unlock the full game. For $2.99 was worth it though. That evil little demon boy was all I wanted to get! Looking forward to a sequel.
B0001I561E|1.0|Bought this &#34;new&#34; and it came in already opened! And the disc was scratched. Shame because this is my favorite Disney movie.
B000ID37T0|5.0|This film is Al Pacino at his absolute very best, as a blind veteran trying to find his way in a world which has changed a lot since his youth. Pacino won an Oscar for his colorful portrayal of Col. Frank Slade, a true classic for future generations !
B00589BMF0|5.0|One of the best action movies ever made! James Cameron and Weaver at the top of their game. Well done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME!!!! My daughter also loves it. It's great fun for the whole family! Would recommend this game to anyone.
B00785P2QC|5.0|its a very fun game. I like to see the little trucks drive on the road download this game now!!!!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|The game starts fairly easily and quickly became more difficult very entertaining.easy to use and aiming is critical but easy. Lots of fun
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Not brilliant, but very engaging.  Book club level literature. Many will be able to relate to the state of marriage that these characters portray. We usually look to wives as the secret keepers; this takes a look at the male perspective. Separate stories are eventually woven together, with a believable outcome.  Charming.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This Game is just so amazing!<br />Reasons why I love this game:<br />1) Beautiful Graphics<br />2) The Just-Right Difficulty<br />3) Enchanting Music<br />4) Hours Of Game play<br />5) Good For All Ages<br />6) Fun &amp; Challenging Levels<br />7) Developers Don't Nag You ( at least not me but others might be bothered)<br />8) Very Realistic<br />9) Reasonable Price<br />10) It Keeps You Busy
B005IQZB14|4.0|Never thought this could be a page turner, but it was.  So vividly written, you feel you are on the hiking trail with her.  It makes you think introspectively about whether or not you could do what she has done.<br />There are so many revelations about the different kinds of people there are in this world.  Not that it's a surprise that some are selfish and some are giving, etc., but even in a very specific and exclusive circumstance we find our heroine learning much about what kind of person she is and what kind of person she wants to be, which is really major for just a walking trip. However, there's no 'just' about it. .<br />Trying to gain closure for her mother's untimely death she embarks upon a very rugged hiking trail that takes her through 3 states that she is not really prepared to travel.  She not only ponders how she is supposed to deal with the death of her mother and the death of her marriage, but if the decision to traverse this whole trail might mean the death of her.<br />Unusual and stimulating, it is worthy of your read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I Love this game! It is really addicting and fun! I recommend this for candy lovers of all ages,Thank You Amazon!!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book makes the Fifty Shades tame! I thought it was HOT! I liked the more realistic story of Eva & Gideon. I can't wait to see the rest of the back stories of these two & Cary. I hope they will pull through! time to get a glass of wine for book two!<br />LOVED IT!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The best adventure movie that was ever made by a film-maker in a hollywood !, great actors and beautiful acting! I would really love to watch the rest of this &#34;unexpected journey &#34; story!, thank you.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I can't imagine making travel arrangements without this amazing site!  Great info both positive and negative feedback from fellow travelers. I research all aspects of our trips to find the best rated locations and know what tourist traps to avoid.  A MUST for travelers who want to get the most from their vacations!
B004UPANAI|5.0|I always love to watch wolverine-movies! so I enjoyed watching this movie too! great actors, we all know it is the greatest story from &#34;comics books&#34; that was ever written by a human! everyone loves a very cool looking Wolverine ! great acting all the way throughout  the movie, thank you!.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good book. Plain and simply a good book. Was hoping it wouldn't end. There were a few times I was starting to get bored but then something exciting would draw me back in.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game because it keeps me going for hours on in. I will<br /><br />tell everyone to play this cause it keep you thinking.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This album is really great as it touches all pop genres.  You can also hear how it's different from the other pop albums out now.  After seeing all the performances of almost all the tracks sang live by Gaga,  you can clearly see how she brings out her talents to this album.<br /><br />All the negativity has to stop.  If you don't like the artist,  have the decency to respect their work (^o^) .  .<br /><br />On the other hand if you like their work.,  support them by buying their album and watching their shows.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|arch Werth shrub barber's mom gOt grudgingly<br />at me for flirting with her oops. hehehe luv y'all stay healthy and clean so we won't die when we're young and little and still in school we wanna live our life till we're already 90
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Plays so well on the kindle fire quick to figure out but still a challenge. Fun and enjoyable. Love the story line as well.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|The ending was terrible. It felt rushed. The first two books were so good. Then, right at the end of the third, all these things start happening and I was thinking &#34;Real or not real?&#34; Not real! It's so random it couldn't possibly be real!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun to play a bit at a time, if you do notuse the in app purchase. 4 stars because of the in app purchase, I would rather just pay and not be nickeled and dimed. That being said I did buy the first crystal/ coin package.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Lots of action.  The story line is a bit weak, and definitely does not make full use of the cast.  There are not many surprises.
B00FOWX6NM|2.0|Returning due to the color not being a gold-brown color but rather just an ugly brown.  Case did look like a really good fit though.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Low quality editing, shallow characters, generally needing improvement. Don't pay for it, don't waste your time reading it for free.
B000I9UA8U|5.0|Have always loved this movie - one of the funniest films around.  My 17 year old niece loves it and gets it, but my 13 year old nephew was bored by it.  It helps if you 'get', or understand, British humor and language.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Wish there weren't so many pop-up ads but other than that, it's as good as the regular computer version and it was free!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|First book had a lot of action, then the second books etc up the third with more background and little action, the third book was filled with intense action.  I can't wait to read the fourth book
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The order came really fast and the people I worked with told me to only use the Kindle cord.I also got credit for it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love it except u cant just type where u would love to be that would make it totally awesome am I write
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Back to his roots...small town southern lawyer fighting for justice in a world still ruled by old traditions.  Some may feel the ending a bit too quick and easy, but the whole book was very Geisha me engaging.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|It's a fun story to follow plus the mini games are a great challenge. You should try playing on the hardest level. It makes the game last longer and challenges your mind
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. You can do almost anything in this app. The only thing that I don't is that you only get a little energy a day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME, can't get enoug of it once you start you just cannot stop...this is worse than having Coffee !!!!
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|Best Animated film of the year without a doubt, does not matter what some people have said about pixar lowering its quality in films, Pixar's magic is clearly demonstrated again on MU<br /><br />Can't wait for Inside Out and The Good Dinosaur in 2015, detractors will have to eat their words<br /><br />Pixar The KING of animation forever :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Do I really have to lay it out why I loved this book??  Well here goes, I  am NOT into romance novels one bit.. In fact more like gruesome horror stories or supernatural thrillers.. When I heard all the hype about Christian Grey-and the Fifty Shades Trilogy I thought well I'll read what, why not..  Lets just say, you fall in love.. E.L James brings back all those feelings we once experienced. She makes you want to feel what Ana and Christian are feeling.. You've got the millionaire megalomaniac sadist and the in experienced virgin that reverts back to her conscious and inner goddes for guidance (such a funny, brilliant way to indulge in Ana's feelings). He wants a sub, she wants.. more..  You long for a relationship (as messed up as it is) like theirs..  Its such a gripping story that will leave you in a whirlwind day dreaming about your own Christian Grey.  The end is nothing you'd ever except which makes E.L James all the more brilliant of a writer and you'll be buying the second novel before you can even begin to wonder!!!  Unbelievably incredible story!  All 3 books of this triliogy will make you feel so alive and envious and so on.. Bravo E.L. James it couldn't have been written any better!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Very good character development, and fun to watch! Nice to see yet another unexpected enemy for the survivors to overcome.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Seriously, this is the best game in the world. It's huge and extremely addictive! Big thumbs up for such an awesome experience.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|SO glad to see David Tennant and Billie Piper again :) Lots of fun, and true to the newest incarnation of the Oncoming Storm.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is not the first time I read this book and it won't be the last.  I can't wait to see the movie!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I cannot never watch this series enough!  Now that I am retired I'll be able to watch the entire series from beginning to end.
B004UID2LC|1.0|nothing in this app that can not be gotten by going to you tube itself.  I guess free is a good price for something that does nothing.
0792844890|5.0|The guys at the office are always quoting from this movie!  Can help themselves.  I would do so too if I could just remember all of the quippy lines.
0307272702|3.0|Gary Taubes writes an interesting and easy to understand book. Although he references several scientific studies and a lot of chemistry and biology, he does not write the book in an overly technical manner. It is easy to understand and follow. Taubes is trying to bring awareness to the way we eat, the reason why we get fat (it is not always related to exercise and the what we eat) and the biology behind it all.<br /><br />Taubes addresses genetic predisposition, current dietary choices, diets and exercise. I personally do not believe in diets because it is not something you can maintain. I believe in changing your unhealthy eating habits to healthy ones. I believe in changing the way you think about food and what you eat. That is my personal philosophy. When I picked up this book, I was expecting a book on the science behind fat storage and weight gain. I was not looking for a diet book. Although Taubes espouses certain ideas, this is not quiet a diet book. It is a book about a certain way of eating and the science behind it.<br /><br />Taubes sometiems takes a myopic view at research so that it backs up his theory. Research on nutrition, fat storage and diets are ongoing and previously held beliefs are debunked and new ones are put forth as viable theories. What I am trying to say is that things change, often; new findings come out every day and Taubes tackles those that back up his theory.<br /><br />Taubes promotes a low carb, Atkins diet. There is research to back him and there is research to disprove him. In my opinion, everyone is different, everyone's genetic and cultural makeup is different. Talk to your doctor, see what works and what doesn't. Eat healthy and stay away from overly processed food. Avoid empty calories and if it has more that 6 ingredients and some that you don't know what they are, then it might be a good idea to skip.<br /><br />This is an interesting read if you are trying to get some background about diets.
B0001I562I|5.0|This is a cute movie that my kids always liked and they always wanted me to watch it with them.  I recommend it for all kids.
B008602KQI|5.0|Stayed close to the book. Jennifer Lawrence was a good choice. If you read the books you should enjoy the movie.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Have this on my  Nook, iPhone and Kindle. I love it and its unlimited skips. It easily beats Pandora out.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book! It was entertaining from beginning to end and I thoroughly enjoyed it!<br />I hope everyone enjoys this read as much as I did!!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|I absolutely love this movie but I can't tell you why..that's the rules of fight club.  Watch for subliminal images  :-)
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I have watched this twice and have enjoyed it each time. An action packed film that I would recommend to anyone that enjoys a good action film.
B000WBOV1G|5.0|I loved the relationship between Shark and his daughter. He was the rough tough in the office. However, he played the loving caring parent with his daughter.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have had this adapter for under 24 hours and I am in love! I bought 3 more this morning for every TV in my house including a 8 inch android tablet for a universal remote. Right now I have my phone and computer to play with and it's amazing. Streaming quality is fantastic and very easy to setup. Although it is currently limited with the few apps that support it, I suspect they have only touched the surface. The ability to stream from my phone or tablet via Netflix, Hulu and Youtube to any TV is amazing and media servers simply can't compete.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|So much better than the movie! Love Nicholas Sparks work, this book was quite the page turner. I highly recommend.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|AHS is just a really good show. It's original and the characters? You love them, then you hate them, then you love them again!! Jessica Lange is just an amazing actress!
B00GN76K4Y|5.0|Our soccer fanatic 9 & 7 yr sons love this game, since downloading this is the only game they play
B0073ODRKG|4.0|Good product,It is a good product complies with all the features expected and cost-benefit ratio. I recommend it to people who want to buy
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Solid book with inspirational stories, and specific tactics to implement. I highlighted 50% of the book...it was that good!! I strongly recommend this book to anyone needing the motivation to Choose Yourself and a blueprint to do it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts out very easy. You begin to think there isn't anything to this game, but as you advance it gets very challenging. This is a great &#34;brain&#34; game.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|Family fun with plenty of laughs.  Well acted with a good story of love and relationship troubles.  One of John Wayne's best, well matched with Maureen O'Hara.
B00GNK18X4|1.0|Some of the worst music to come out of one of the worst &#34;bands&#34; of all time.  Everything is produced with absolutely shallow and sugar coated pop lyrics with the simplest hooks.  Granted, the target audience is tween and young teen girls, but even for them, there are better options.  Much better options.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait to read the last book!!!! Very good book, better than the movie!!! I love the series of the hunger games.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|This is a most excellent way to remember the Twin Towers. The story of how this gentleman set about this and another crosswalk is truely astounding. I would much rather watch this each year on 9-11 than the alternative unfortunate tragic truth. This one ends very well, indeed.
B002361MLA|5.0|Every word in this book has come from soul & heart of the author. Very intricate , highly spiritual questions find answers in this book in the simplest of the language enabling even a lay person to understand it with ease which cannot be explained.
147676459X|5.0|Just epically amazeballs and 100% Allie Brosh, it's got the classics which were great to read again, but some of the new stuff is the best stuff I've seen. Loved it.
B00BAXFAJC|3.0|This novel starts off super-strong, very intriguing. The period details are authentic and compelling. But the novel goes on way too long, with the characters getting less interesting as the same story is told from a second point of view. Because the second half of this (long) book is less interesting than the first, you come away with an unsatisfied feeling.
147676459X|5.0|Allie's a fantastic writer. I bought this in hardcover, even though I rarely purchase books anymore, and I could not be happier for my purchase.<br /><br />The repeat comics were still amazing to read. The new ones were fantastic. Even as the book got a bit heavier towards the end, it was honest, beautiful, and thoughtful.<br /><br />Allie, you aren't a s***ty person. You are a truthful, introspective one. You make peoples lives better. You definitely made me think - about you, about your stories, about myself - and you made me laugh.<br /><br />Read this book. It's awesome.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Great period drama of a simpler life :-). Can't wait to watch the remaing seasons. Wish I could watch Amazon Prime on my TV instead of iPad.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great acting and action packed movie.  Aligns well with the book.  Kept moving and keeps your interest throghout the entire movie.
B00C2UUDMG|3.0|Not a bad book by any means but it all felt a bit impersonal to me. It was full of procedural detail, no doubt very carefully researched, but it lacked heart and character development. I'm interested in knowing about the relationship between Harry and Mickey, but not really in knowing the titles of the forms they use in the US courts system...
B00CB3N5DS|5.0|If you like realistic kung-fu action, this is it. Ip-Man is an honorable figure. There is one particular fight scene that is jaw-dropping ferocious and incredible.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was filled with excitement loves action. The diverse whimsical characters and the events and photos made me refuse to put these book down
B00E5N8E2O|1.0|Very bad quality of music. I have been a big fan of Def Leppard from the begining but the quality is terrible
B008NEMN0K|5.0|What a perfect movie to get in 3D you are jumping in you seat the amount of 3D action in this.
0887307280|5.0|Must have for entrepreneurs or business professionals. I read this book in college because it was assigned but was pleasantly surprised at the validity of the information in this book. I keep an updated copy of this in my personal library and use it as a reference or reread it as a refresher for my business acumen.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|Cool product and totally what I expected to get. I think my son will love it and it looks very durabile.
B000I9U9A4|4.0|Great story and acting by Russell Crowe and Paul Bethany ( I think that is his name).  I would definitely recommend this movie.
B003B02PEU|4.0|Mr. Grisham has again held my interest from beginning to end. He continues to amaze me with his ability to keep me coming back for more and never being let down.
B00FJSSK1O|5.0|Once again, Amazon did not ship what was advertised. I received a digipack CD version of this release, NOT the DVD style packaging which is pictured. This also happened on the Testament-Dark Roots Of Thrash release. I wanted what is PICTURED/ADVERTISED so I sent it back. I have a feeling this is going to happen again on the upcoming Nightwish cd/dvd release too. *Update: The Nightwish release I ordered from Amazon WAS the cd digipack version too and I will be sending it back. Also, I have changed my star rating to 5, as my review reflects on the packaging not the contents on the discs inside.
B00ESJICMC|5.0|Classic James Blunt - the more you listen, the more addicted you are to it! There's something about the lyrics and melody that get you hooked!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I Loved this book. It has been an inspirational and amazing journey for both James and Bob. It was a heart warming feel good book from the first page to the last.
B00164GDA0|5.0|Classic, got to share with my grandson. Wonderful story, great acting, highly recommend to anyone who has not seen it.
B00GQ7OPG6|2.0|Cheesy like a soap opera, this season went way downhill.  So many stupid lines that don't make sense.  They should of ended on a high note like breaking bad or boston legal instead of dragging it out to make a few more bucks.  I paid for the whole season and stopped watching after episode 5.  Im gonna request a refund for this season.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! It relaxes me and I'm addicted at the same time. I am so glad I can now play it on my Kindle! It is big and bright and well-spaced for older players like me. Every level is different and a little more challenging. Thank you for Candy Crush.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I Love Hill Climb racing because it is very entertaining, but most importantly it isn't a game that expects you to buy everything to play. You know how it is you get a free game that looks fun until you play it and it is either a demo or you have to purchase things with money in the game, to actually make it fun. It is completely different with this game, yes things that you get with coins from the game are priced high, but the difference is is that you can get up to more that 30,000 coins in a game (the most common is not this high it is about 10,000-15,000 but my highest is higher than 30,000). You will definetly enjoy this game it is fun and entertains for hours:)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am on Facebook at least 10 times a day. I can talk to all my friends at once. What a concept!
1451695195|4.0|Great Book, I bought it in Spanish and English to give to my family. I now want to learn more about this theme.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Hard to believe that this is true in American history. All though we still have a ways to go. Good read
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I don't have to convince anyone that this is the Christmas story of Christmas stories. Dickens was a genius, and I love this story.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Real Steel WRB is a great game b/c it keeps you going buying new robots and upgrading is awesome the only thing is the time it takes for you to fight.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A fun game and none of the levels have been too difficult yet! I have only reached level 75 though.
B00013RC66|5.0|Both Debra Winger and Theresa Russell offer great performances.  This film will not help your world view of the female gender.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|The all star cast is fantastic.  This movie is full of Action and the humor puts it over the top for entertainment value.
630529142X|4.0|Just crazy fun to watch.  You will probably take away lines from the film that will creep into your conversations. One of our favorite lines is, &#34;You da Debil.&#34; Translated is, &#34;You the Devil.&#34; That is what Adam Sandler's mother, Kathy Bates, calls Sandler's girlfriend.  A completely silly movie, meant to be for pure entertainment. No brain necessary. Enjoy.
B00GNL251C|4.0|This is a very engrossing movie when it comes to characters, setting, and action. The movie doesn't simply focus on who wins the next fight, but explores the interplay between the characters in the context of historical events and in the world of martial arts. This Wong Kar Wai film is of course different from the films starring Donnie Yen. But no doubt, there are some great fight scenes.<br /><br />It is a stylish movie with beautiful set-pieces, but does not shy away from brutal fight sequences. I understand the original movie was 4 hours, but was cut down for US audiences. It would be interesting to see the original. And as always, Tony Leung, and Ziyi Zhang are great. A definite one to watch!
B00H1O3Q18|5.0|Unbelievable!! Truly the best drama on any network!! These actors are so talented . How is it that they have not been awarded every accolade available to them? Emmy people - WAKE UP!! Don't let the genre of the series dissuade you from your long denied responsibility. It'll be a long wait till the series returns, that's for sure.
B0091VYG86|4.0|It gave a look at changing vaues in our society in an entertaining way.  Having two well liked stars, Reese and Tobey added to the realism of the movie.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I've been in IT for about 13 years now, in several different companies, some good, some great, some terrible. A lot of this book made me really uncomfortable, reminding me of terrible all-nighters that I pulled at terribly run companies. But by the end, there's a lot of hope and inspiration to be found.<br /><br />The core of the book is that IT can learn a lot from what we've learned in manufacturing - less inventory, less Work in Progress, don't accept work that you can't finish, always focus on the most valuable work, and so forth. None of this is news to most of us, but this book does a good job of tying the ideas together in a really compelling, easy-to-read narrative. When you're done with this book, you'll hopefully be inspired to dive into other reading to figure out how to actually make this vision come to reality.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I began watching current season and loved SUITS so much I wanted to go back get to know the prior first 2 seasons.  It was great.
B00EVPSJOE|5.0|Because I got it quickly and was able to listen to it.  No defects no problems...perfect.  What's not to love?
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|fun to play and pretty addictive easy game that can drive you crazy when you have to start over. thanks
0618154248|5.0|Both kids and adults love this! It is catchy, but also has great lessons in the words in the songs
0694003611|5.0|This book is a classic story for young children and should be in every child's library.  My students in preschool and kindergarten loved it.  The art makes the story come alive.
B000007XUQ|5.0|This album is still one of my all-time favorite Christmas albums.  Karen Carpenter's mellow voice caresses the standard Christmas songs in a way that evokes home and family.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Nice table about family, loyalty and dealing with mistakes of the past.  Love that it all revolves around the heroine.
B00FP1NNJY|5.0|I love the beat and music to this song. I really enjoy the collaboration of Pitbull and Ke$ha, I hope they work together more often on songs. Give this a shot and you'll love it.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|This is a true Coen Brothers classic film.  Hilarious from beginning to end the adventures of &#34;the Dude&#34; unfold in a real laugh riot if you appreciate sarcastic witty humor.  Definitely not a family film because of language and small amounts of nudity.  If you have ever seen a Coen Bros. film and liked it I highly recommend this movie!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great Calculator, uses the Kindle's large screen well making the calculator easy to read and easier to use. I would recommend this to any kindle owner as this does the trick quickly and easily. the calculator comes with the traditional math equations and percentage in a nice looking package.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|very fun game. I really like it and all the themes they<br /> make it. right now it is a Christmas theme and I love it!
B000YJ85BI|4.0|I've now finished the first 3 books.  This is a great finish to the trilogy.  I can't wait for the next series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game requires focus and the ability to remember colors and number and sometimes a piece in order it's a challenge. but fun
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not traditional Kay Scarpetta. The older books were more interesting and had more science, not so much DRAMA. The relationship aspect is nice but I started reading these foe the interesting science cases. She needs to get back to that.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is very enjoyable and good relaxing entertainment.  Can't wait to watch it again.  Have no complaints whatsoever.  It's the best.
B0027ZCQ4E|5.0|Great series of movies.  Very convenient to watch on Amazon.  I like the suspense and the characters in the movies.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We love it.  Can't wait to find more great shows like this.  Thanks for good entertainment at its best. Enjoy!
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|It was a great pleasure and funny. It's obvious Claire loves those Cats and spends lot of time watching for them and their nature. Cats forever!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Super cute movie!  I saw this one after watching despicable me 2 (I think the sequel is better) but still really enjoyed both of them.  Good for adults and kids.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite books I have ever read. Suzanne Collins wrote another fantastic book, and I am so excited for the movie to come out!
B0084670FU|2.0|Love the actor but this movies was very hard to follow, I guess why they called it Bablel<br />Little more of an adult them I believe.  Was not crazy about the Japanese scenes although I love the country and people
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My granddaughter loves them. She like to play house with them. and she play with them a lot she likes the ones that makes noises.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Pretty true to the spirit of the book even if some details are fudged a little. Nice imagery, not as brutal as I saw things in my head while reading the book. Nicely done movie adaptation.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book more than any other book I've ever read! The romance I'm this book is so much better than in the movie!!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|The game is fun makes hunting fun. Love how you can upgrade the guns easily  .makes it easier to kill the game Would recommend to all ages! Thanks
1781162646|5.0|I'm just a stephen king fan!  I got hooked on his first series and have jumped on every thing he writes or does a movie...I know it has no reality, but I just love it for pure entertainment !!!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|awesome movie with a great soundtrack!  if you were an &#34;80's baby&#34; then you need to see this movie!  The colors and special effects are exactly the way this movie was meant to be seen!
B000B589JI|3.0|Smaller than expected. Tolerances for the two threaded ends are way too big. Not a tight fit. I filled with fluid and it evaporated in 1 wk.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|fun to play and easy to download, I liked it and would recommend it to other for a enjoyable game
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|Very cute prequel to Monsters Inc., interesting character development on Mike and Sully. It could have used a bit more development on Randall, who somehow became much meaner by the Monsters Inc. timeline. The &#34;cookie&#34; about the snail-monster was dumb.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I started playing Magic several months after many of my friends, putting me super far behind in the learning curve.  With the app, I am up to speed and can easily compete with more experienced players.  Also, I paid for the co-op feature and playing against friends is pretty cool, too.
1848507836|5.0|Very amazing and interesting memoir of Anita's death from cancer and subsequent cure! God bless her for sharing her story.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Like being able to get on facebook away from the computer, but not as easy as using on the computer.
B00F452NG0|3.0|Not as fast and clear as the game played on a pc.  Its still fun but easy to win because the play is so slow.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is a really good app it takes clear videos and clean pictures.I love this app you should get it
B007EECSFA|3.0|A slow start but I was determined to finish it since the writing was  well done. The ending was satisfying.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Thanks to Josh, we are now aware of the dangers of fracking. I am so glad that this film came into my life during this new century. Josh shows us how to care like he cares. I like the way Josh is actively involved in talking to his audience in the film. He is right there, right with us, involved and telling us his visions.
0385537131|4.0|Slow paced, almost a &#34;shaggy-dog story,&#34; but the last 40 pages had me on the edge of my seat. The ending left me with tears in my eyes. Grisham is a true master, but you have to stay with this one until the end to find that out.
B00514HDNW|1.0|Too one dimensional with an insecure perpetually confused lead player. Didn't want to give up but started scanning instead of reading. Should have just quit.
B009FBX5M0|3.0|Actually not, simply because the title song (unlike every other bond soundtrack) didn't have the theme song.  Not having the song takes away from the soundtrack.  Further I had to order the adelle one (that I was debating between the 2 when I first ordered and couldn't see the difference as I thought both had the theme song) and that is one song. What kind of garbage is that paying 12 dollars or so for one song.<br /><br />I noticed the adele song at one polnt in the song has added a little more than the one in the movie version.  It is either to make more money or perhpas a conflict with Adelle.  I don't know how those things work.  I wish I knew who to contact on these things, as I think my complaint would get lost in the mill of things and nothing would change anyway.  But perhaps I would know why the song wasn't on the original soundtrack.  One other complaint I also see in small print on the back of the cd case that it says it doesn't have the song.  One I ordered on line and even if I had the actual ced I may not have seen it.<br /><br />I don't mind paying for a cd I just like my money worth.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|THE SOUNDS AND THEMES ARE HYPNOTIC - WONDERFUL TO LISTEN TO AND WATCH! HIS USE OF UNUSUAL SOUNDS AND INSTRUMENTS IS VERY INVENTIVE
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a fabulous series and you can't wait to see the next show.  A must have for someone who likes a deep involved story line.
B008RF0M9O|5.0|I thought I would need to buy a new pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones because of the ear pad deterioration until I saw this product, read the reviews and decided that it was worth giving it a try, especially at such an attractive price point. I received the product sooner than I thought I would, and they arrived in good shape. I needed to work on attaching them to the headphones a little bit, but it's not really difficult and quite simple to understand, so in short order I had them attached and ready to go. They fit perfectly on the headphones, are comfortable to wear and definitely improve the sound! Best of all, they saved me $$$$ that new set of headphones would have cost me. At an amazing low price, too! I'm thrilled with these.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Amazing story! What a tragic &#34;real life&#34; ending to our hero! Operatives in war are always interesting and heroic in nature. It's what draws us to their story. &#34;Well done&#34;
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Language turned to perfection around a compelling plot. Ms. Tartt makes one wish for beauty and desire a life filled with art.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What's not to love about Christian and Anna.....love,sex,kink, many firsts, and a story that weaves through it all. The whole trilogy is a winner. All our friends, male ans female, totally enjoyed the books. It;s not &#34;War and Piece&#34; and it was never meant to be! Have a fun read...it's worth it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love being able to do this on my kindle.  I can't believe how much stuff I can do on my kindle now.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I've long wanted to read more about Tesla and this book has given me wonderful new information. Read it in one go.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It has taken me a few days to consider what I felt after reading this book. After being so completely engrossed in the first two books of the series, I followed the plot of this final installed quite carefully. I also was extremely interested in how the author would choose to end the story. After all of the physical and emotional damage done to the main characters Katniss, Gale and Peeta, she could not possibly have just trundled them off to a happy ending and have them ride off into the sunset. Some major things had to happen to resolve the relationship triangle between them. To my mind, Ms. Collins took them down the most logical path, the only one that could realistically happen after all that they had been through. Even more damage was done in the course of this book and that damage made the final conclusion almost inevitable and it was handled with grace and care. I was very satisfied with the ending and it makes me want to encourage anyone interested in the first book or has seen the movies to read this final volume. It was worth the wait and the rough ride to get here
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Can't wait for the next one!  Scarpetta needs her own TV miniseries.  I know I would watch all of it.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is a great show! powerful and exciting! great special features! I love zombie movies and this show surpasses all of them!
B006QPX6IG|5.0|The fact that Kevin Conway wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for his performance in this film is the reason I no long watch the Academy Awards, nor care who wins.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|My wife and me watched and loved the original local TV series broadcasting. Whenever possible we buy some chapters to complete the series.
B007R11DKQ|4.0|It was an enjoyable fantasy science fiction type movie. Acting good, plot interesting, good vs. evil, keeps you guessing, and the end had a good climax.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|If you were expecting justice and honor, then forget it. The ending is dark and confusing and lacking. The end.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I always loved free cell. This is the best version I've played yet. It gives new life to an old favorite.
B004EPYZSU|1.0|While the movie certainly deserves much higher, this rating is for the fact that the digital copy included with the Blu-ray is not of HD quality. If you buy a Blu-ray copy of a movie, you should get a blu ray equivalent digital copy for the cloud. Again another hit against the studios who keep giving their patrons crap. (And the studios wonder why people don't want to give them their money.) At least, it puts a smile on my face to know that piracy provides the studios with a tax against their needless BS.<br /><br />At the end of the day, providing digital copies is a great innovation to incentivize the purchase of films, especially when you can access them in the cloud to play anywhere. But if the studios can't provide similar quality, then what's the point?
B00BY8DIT2|4.0|I loved Boom Boom Bang Bang CD. Personal taste. Seesaw had its great moments. Love Beth Hart. Choice between the 2 CD's? I'd spent my money on BBBB CD.
B005LAIII0|1.0|While the movie itself deserves five stars, I only buy movies these days that have a digital copy. The digital copy in this set is not an hd digital copy which you could use to watch on a big screen tv or even on a 27 inch monitor. In effect the digital copy sent with this set can only be used on small portable players. While that may be ok for most people, I want a digital collection that can be watched anywhere on HD sets without having to lug around the discs. Of course it begs the question, if studios can't provide a better product, why should they ever expect piracy to cease?
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Easy and useful the two things I look for in an app. Helps too optimize my Internet experience. I recommend this app. wholeheartedly
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Terrific book... I have referenced it (and Gladwell's other books) many times in speeches, conversations and in my own books.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|It's an interesting game yet it's very fun. Got it from the Free App of the Day. Works nicely on the Nexus 4
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|It is better than on my pc. Love that I can take it everywhere I go. I should have gotten it sooner.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I wanted a compact yet roomy storage solution for my two cameras, flash, multiple lenses, and accessories.  THIS IS IT!  I love it.  The backpack is not big and bulky. It is lightweight.  It has plenty of room inside and lots of velcro separators that protect your equipment.  It also has two inside pocketse and two outside pockets that hold your extras like memory cards, business cards, cell phone, etc.  It is very sturdy and well made. I highly recommend this for any photographer with multiple lenses and camera bodies.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|it was good, but not as good as the first 2 books. The ending was disappointing, but understood where she was coming from with it, it made sense
B004W1GCNC|5.0|whitty...funny...heart felt  great series i have enjoyed the series and hopes that it will continue the series some time down the road... amazon does have a eye for picking out the great series...thank you
B00G3HSF7O|1.0|Save your money.  Not even worth a dollar. Even a twelve year old would find this silly and absurd.  And I like science fiction.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|HAD MANY PROBLEMS FROM THE START..WITH MY AMAZON PRIME POINTS AND USING THEM TO MAKE PURCHASE ON RESTAURANT STORY...THEN HAVING TO WRITE TO THE STORM8 TEAM AND GETTING A PRE-WRITTEN MESSAGE BACK ..THAT REALLY DID NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM...THEN AFTER MANY WEEKS THEY DID RESTORE MY AMAZON POINTS BACK..BUT AT THAT TIME I WAS DISALLUSIONED ..I DID PLAY THIS WITH MY GRANDDAUGHTER FOR FUN SINCE SHE WAS IN ANOTHER STATE...THEN I RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM ANOTHER NEIGHBOR THAT TYPED PROFANITY ON THE WALL OF MY RESTAURANT STORY AND MY GRANDDAUGHTER SAW AND WAS SHOCKED AND I WROTE AGAIN TO STORM8 TEAM ABOUT THIS AND AFTER MANY MANY WEEKS OF RE-WRITNG ..I GAVE UP AND REMOVED THE MESSAGE WITH THE PROFANITY FROM THE BAD NEIGHBOR AND..THEN THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH  SAME NAME AND I WAS NOT GETTING MY GRANDDAUGHTER OR OTHER MSGS FROM GOOD NEIGHBORS..I HAVE SINCED STOPPED  USING RESTAURANT STORY.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|The stories are intricate and compelling, but without Kindle x-ray I would have definitely gotten lost a time or two. It was a slow start, as he has so much scene-setting to do, but I have a feeling the payoff will be worth it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book is written from the eye of a scientist turned spiritual. His travels and recovery will forever make him a valuable asset to the medical community.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone. Those in the medical community, those who have had NDE and those who want to be inspired.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|These young men are AMAZING!  I purchase one new Christmas CD every year and Buon Natale is my new favorite.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|The story was truly scary, especially when you consider it is about something that really happened.  Also, the sound was good.  Sound is important.  The element of fright is often diminished by overpowering musical score.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am hooked on this game.  So glad I can get it on my Kindle. Good job,Amazon.  you are my heroes
B004ADH1RI|5.0|The Goonies is a Classic movie that should be watched for every generation.  My kids will always remember it and sometime bring up in randon conversations.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|I am a huge Jeff Bridges fan and if you are, you will like this movie. I am generally not crazy about sci-fi and movies that rely on special effects. However, this movie has a great story line and most of us need to lighten up and just be less serious every now and then. Get ready to laugh.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This book was a page turner. Once I started I couldn't put it down. First One I Read by Baldacci and absolutely loved it
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Like reading a class &#34;B&#34;  chick flick! She takes the anticipation of doing something (having some form of a sexual encounter) like a school girl on her first outing. On and on and on of trivial nothings. Thought as a guy would give me some positive guidance of how women relate. I should have known better. If this is erotic reading for women . . . .  then I'm glad men have their own style. Such dribble
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I purchased my Chromecast a few weeks ago and I love the device.<br />I use it mostly to stream Netflix while I am doing my homework or a project where I need to use my laptop. Before I was plugging my laptop up to my TV and in doing that I cannot get the use of my computer at the same time, so this device is perfect for multitasking.<br /><br />I come from a family of Apple lovers so I have received a lot of flack for buying this device and having windows or Android products over Apple products. So it being compared to the Apple TV is a little frustrating at times.<br /><br />Again, Netflix is my top use, the quality is amazing and I like that I can put on a movie and close my computer or open up a new tab and do research. It does get a little frustrating when watching a TV show because sometimes it doesn't register that you have watched it but switching is very easy of course, so it doesn't change how I feel about the product.<br /><br />Streaming my browser straight to the TV does not have a great quality but I do not use this feature much unless the site contains a video or content I want to make bigger to show someone.<br /><br />When I purchased there were not many comments about it or reviews so I purchased it by chance from just reading a small description and seeing what it could do in the commercials, but it is exactly what I have been looking for in a device. Before the Chromecast was released I was looking into a Wireless HDMI but I am glad I did not spend the money to buy that product. The price for the Chromecast is amazing on top of that, I was shocked at how low the price was.<br /><br />UPDATE!<br />I just posted this review but I was looking through comments and discovered that I can stream local content by dragging the file into my browser search bar and it works amazing.<br />I have a lot of video files and being able to watch movies in that format is amazing. Everything I learn about this device make me love it even more!
B009NX1YT6|5.0|Classic for kids and adults.  Olivia Newton.John Travolta have on-screen charisma.  What else can I say?  Good over-all movie entertainment.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|It was a good story and the actors did a great job. Thor was easy on the eyes! and well toned!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|well done, enjoyed it totally...tell a friend tell a friend... why do they require you to write anything at all....<br />I either like something or I don't...do I truly need an opinion? good is good
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was really enjoying this series until I read the ending. I really felt let down after being built up. Oh, well. Probably won't read any more of these works.
B008602KQI|5.0|I didn't want to see this movie; figured it was for 'kids.' Imagine my surprise when I decided to watch on Amazon! I can now see what all the hype is about. The story was different, and I was dazzled by the creativity of the costumes, make up, and the sets. I will be seeing The second installment in the theater!
B00FPH6M82|2.0|Yeah, just a showcase movie for Jaden Smith, that was all......Will didn't do alot in this movie except command his son to do whatever he needed to do, but I just didn't get into that otherworldly feeling.....just didn't work for me.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|One of the best Science fixion series I have ever watched and the best remake I have ever watched! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|It Is Free Cell If You Like Free Cell You Will like This Game Because It Is Free Cell You Play It Just Like You'd Play Free Cell That's It
B00FRN2QZM|5.0|Just AMAZING. Best songwritting I've heard in a long time. Glad there is still great music being created in this world!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is funny from beginning to end - also like the original Vacation movie.  Christmas Vacation shows Chevy Chase as the 'daddy Griswold' at his best where everything that could go wrong does - from stringing lights, lighting them, the tree getting burned down by the grandpa, right down to the squirrel and dog (who chases it) destroying much of the home and the next door neighbor, who also gets in on the fun antics.  A good family movie that's up there with the other timeless yearly Christmas movie traditions like Miracle on 34th St., Home Alone, and A Christmas Story.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this series. I have the paperbacks of the series but had to get it on my kindle too. I have read through it a few times.  Wow is all I can say  this was a fantastic ride.
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|Decibel Magazine Ranked this the #1 Metal Album of 2013, and they were right. Who would have thought Carcass could have come back after 17 years and delivered such a masterpiece? I really enjoy this album alot. Pure Death Metal, pure and simple.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Simply the greatest TV show ever produced.  It is worth watching and re-watching over and over again to see the transformation of Walter White from a cancer stricken chemistry teacher into a drug kingpin with unchecked narcississim.<br /><br />The acting is top-notch across the board.  The characters are deep and layered and the situations they get into are completely screwed up.  You will find yourself binge watching this show - 2 or 3 episodes a night until it is complete.
B00BYKIKJS|4.0|The acting is superb, the story is refreshing. An all-around good film. And, of course, Jennifer Lawrence is in it. Actually, the cast is full of reputable actors and actresses.<br /><br />The only...thing is that watching it is kind of stressful, especially in the beginning. It comes with the context, though. The story is honest, and reality is rarely always painless or frustration free. I'll probably have to wait a while before I can watch this one through again, but I will definitely be watching it again.<br /><br />Anyway, it has a good mix of comedy, romance, family and life. This movie purchase was definitely worth the money and time.
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|Very Good.....Fast arrived in Brazil ... product of great quality .... the only problem was that the box came half open ...but nothing that has affected the product....Thks
B000001DQI|5.0|awesome cd.  arrived in excellent shape. another cd added to my collection of great music. listen to it almost daily.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Well, it's exactly what I expected; a high quality plastic replica. Granted it's not the most detailed work of art, I was surprised as to the different sound effects being played (it rotates through 4 different sounds every time you press the activator). The ink nibs and slider button cap are also rather loose, and of course, it's impossible to activate the lights and sound effects while sliding the head out, contrary to the cannon version. Also, the &#34;swivel crystal&#34; visible through the clear tubing should be slightly thinner and a gold color, not navy blue. But all aside, it's an official sonic screwdriver! Fantastic, really!
B002DKF47O|5.0|Brutal and solid from beginning to end. Superb production. Every extreme metal band should listen to this album all the way through.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|Too long!  Center section was very repetitive.  Was disappointed in the book since it was ranked so high.  Would not recommend.
B00070Q8DQ|4.0|The only thing I could say that I did not like about this album is the vocal production. That's it. It's a brutal metal album in every legitimate sense of the term.<br /><br />...but I would love to have heard the vocal track re-recorded/remastered.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|It's very simple and doesnt toss ads in you're face constantly. I love the fun little achievements you can get as well. Encourages me to play more and differently
B001NLL8LA|5.0|A great story that keeps you on the edge of your chair, start to finish. I have always enjoyed the Reacher stories.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|I adore this collection. This was the greatest show I ever watched and I doubt it will ever be surpassed. So owning this is kind of an event for me, and I couldn't be more pleased.<br />I preordered and received on release date, unfortunately, my set was not packaged well and was pretty much destroyed. I was frustrated, but Amazon processed my refund VERY quickly and I am still pleased with their customer service.<br />Anyway, I went out and bought the set where I could examine it thoroughly first! lol<br />Its a great set, tons of fun. There are plenty of reviews detailing the set and they are accurate. Its great.<br />The only thing is.........I think the printings on the BR holders is a little weird. I would prefer to just have the picture on the top of the case....when am I ever going to take out the BRs to see the complete picture?! Plus, that's how its displayed on the back. You can clearly see the entire teddy bear and Walts face on the cases that have BRs in them...but that is not how it really is. All the BRs will need to be removed and then the case put back together to see this. I don't love it. Am I the only one? No one else mentioned it so maybe so, but I figured there might be another weirdo out there that agrees.<br />But it doesn't matter!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great set!!!!!!!!!!! Prized possession!!!!!!!!!
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Funny movie for 18 and older. Would definitely recommend watching it.<br />Really liked the out takes. More movies should have them.<br />Enjoy!
0525478817|5.0|Holt McDougal has always been one of my favorite authors. I pre-ordered his latest novel to get the much-revered McDougal signature on the inside cover - what we \\"in the know\\" crowd like to call the M-scribble - and I was very pleased. Personally, I can't wait to see what Holt McDougal does next - I'm sure it will capture the hearts of many just as this novel has.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|it is a good game but cant use it because I accidentally un installed it so that kind of stinks
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This is a light cotton candy series that will appeal to your sensual adventurer and your idealistic romantic heart. I found this to be a pleasant escape.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use it for everything!  I am a teacher and I use it for grades.  It's great and I use it all the time.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Absolutely addicted to this series now, really love the prime option, got rid of netflix and love this option. Well worth the 79 bucks a year, plus free shipping on prime items.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the romance and getting the feeling of poverty which a lot of people take for granted.<br />I give this book a 5 star rating for the anticipation that puts the reader on the edge of their seat.
B00G70WLJA|1.0|ok thats it.  Hugh Jackson needs to stop playing Wolverine.  thats enough.  don't make another X-Man movie for about 5 years and then do reboot with all new actors and directors.  nuff said.<br /><br />what we're all thinking it.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|It was funny. Some language and adult content. Didn't really like the whole punch line though but if u like stupid funny this movie is for u
B0012HF5NC|4.0|I borrow it from the library every Fourth of July and never get tired of it.  So I finally bought it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game !!!!!!!!  It's amazing and I can play it for hours without getting bored it really makes it seem like you have your own horse
B00AF6B22E|3.0|Pretty trashy movie for ole Denzel. This airline pilot was a drunk, coke head, meth head, womanizer, smart ass and a pretty good pilot. Be aware, this movie opens XXX rated. I have a friend who wanted to see it. I warned her over and over about how trasy it was in the opening. She was a senior lady. She watched it and was appalled! I told her. He must have needed money to make this movie. MD-80s can not fly upside down. Get past the opening and its a pretty good movie.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|This movie has it all! It has great special effects and it feels as if you were actually there living it for yourself. The gore is really intense.
1468179993|3.0|Sadly, the book provides nothing on how to deliver a TED talk.<br /><br />It does provide public speaking tips (and some good ones at that).  I think if they re-titled the book &#34;How to give a great presentation&#34; or &#34;How to speak in front of a group&#34; they would have an accurate title.<br /><br />Nothing in the book talks about how to prepare for, apply for, and be accepted to present at TED.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|It's just as I remembered it as a kid haha. The story and soundtrack are just amazing. It still makes me cry to this day...
B000F1IQNM|5.0|My favorite Nanny McPhee movie. I have both this one and the 2nd one. Perfect movies to watch with the kids.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|On your alarm clock you have a clock you can set times and check the weather it comes with a variety of choices for the sound I will assure you that you will find it to be a good product as I did
B003L20IJM|4.0|The kids loved this movie and I just wanted to have both the first and 2nd movies to keep the kids entertained. I enjoyed the first one better but this one was good too.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Pro's: graphics are based on device and the quality of it. The better graphics the better chance you have. They are amazing though. Even the cheap ones. Cars are awesome, tracks can test you, but master them then come meet me in the world series!!! You don't win every match but hey I can't tell you all the secrets except that if you want to be on top you have to play hard. Way worth it.<br />Con's: beware the servers!! They can sometimes mess up but hey for this price I give it five stars. It's just keeps getting better. You<br />have to have strong WiFi signal and good battery life if you don't want to get kicked out of live matches. It may take over a lot more of your time because it is so addictive!!! Leveling up takes forever.<br />If you want to be the best you have to race with the best!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A worthy sequel to one of my favorite Stephen King books. The story-telling is expansive and tight, and the scares come early and linger.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is just awsome. Ignore all the negative comments, the app might have been bad last year but now its great, works fine
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book is my favorite book ever and I recomend it to any person who like fantasy books in which the story is more about the chareter and not about killing monsters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game, but sometimes it can be very challenging and I like that. The game holds your interest.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I hate some of the levels, but it's fun and addicting lol! Wish you find  have to buy some of the cool candies, wish you could have a way to earn some ;)
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It is really fun but most of the time your just waiting for it to load, but by the time it loads it's a great game!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Wow, not happy.  I loved the first book.  The second book was very frustrating.  Tris and Tobias get together over and over again just to betray eachother, but the ending was great.  The ending made up for the majority of the second book being frustrated.  So you would think Tobias would learn to trust Trias.  Not so much.  It's like the characters got labotomy before Allegiant, and stopped acting like themselves.  I'm sorry for everyone that fell in love with the first two books like I did, because Allegiant is just a huge dissapointment.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALER**<br /><br />Obviously I'm sad Tris died, but I understand that her stepping in for Caleb is true to her character.  That's basically what she did when shen went to the Erudite headquarters in Insurgent, just this time she had better motives.  So I understand why her character did it.  It just sucks that she died.  Like I read in another review, &#34;Harry didn't die for Peter Petigrew.&#34;  It would have been a buch better ending for me, if Caleb knocked her out of the way and took the bullet for her.  Just saying.<br /><br />However, let's back up a second.  Why did Tobias go along with the first plan to steal &#34;truth serium.&#34;  What happened to the revelation from the second book?<br /><br />Also, how did Uriah get more &#34;coverage&#34; of his death than Tris?  Even if she had to die, it happened so fast.  I kept reading expecting it not to be real.  It happened so fast and moved on before I could grasp what happened.  Not at all happy with this book.
B0001WGIBW|5.0|Very useful set for expanding Brio train track layouts.  Price is better than I have seen elsewhere.  High quality wood.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|love this movie, didnt have it on DVD so had to but it on here to watch for the night
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This was a surprisingly funny movie. I didn't expect to like it so much. Not at all your typical space alien film.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love this game. A must have if you own it on a console to get your unlocks. Dc heroes!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My grand son is 10 and he loves it because he  is a big Dr. Who fan.I would reccomend it.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Wow!  What a fantastic movie!  This ranks up there with the Godfather!  The grittiness and violence make this movie seem very real, and it is based on events that actually happened!  If you lovr Mob films. this is a must have!
0451232852|4.0|Didn't realize it was a paperback when ordered.  Pages were VERY THIN and many times I turned more than one at once.  Served the purpose of preparing to read the 2nd book of the trilogy.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I don't think I have a game quite like this one before.  It is very interesting and takes some thinking.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a game that can not be conquered quickly. I do hope you all enjoy the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|cant get enough! I have a sweet tooth for real. wonder if I can give candy crush out for holloween.
B004J4WKUQ|1.0|Most boring book I ever read. Worst story line. If you dont believe me waste your money. Do not buy
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Save your money, until this app is fix.  I enjoy the Duel of the Planeswalker series,  so I was psyched about getting Magic 2014 for my tablet. Once I downloaded this app and playing it, it became evident that this app has a major bug.  The game will crash regularly after winning a match. And of course it crashes before saving the game, so the bug screws up your progress on campaign mode. Although I like the game, the crash bug and the size of the game (1.4 gb) makes for only a 1 star game.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|It's little more than ridiculously fantastic smash erm' up, bang em' bang em' up and shoot him.up and shoot him.
B004XQO8VO|4.0|great corny movie. the acting is not the best, but the story is a good concept and fun. lot of action and humor.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|This was a good story, well-written, and interesting. I have recommended it to others  have recommended it to others, too.
0962477060|5.0|I bought this because it was recommended by several guitarist I know personally. While it is very informative and can take you from beginner on up, I would recommend someone already playing to introduce you. I am a little past the beginning stage. Well worth the money as I have improved with practices from the book. Now I just need more time to practice.
B0053O89K6|5.0|I love the whole series of House.  This final season series was as good as the previous 7.  Cast is outstanding.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm a horse lover and this is the best app ever nut you do learn the commitment of having a horse
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Cute puzzle game... Nicely packaged collection of puzzle games. However, the linearity ofcthe story basically means &#34;solve the puzzles and go for the ride.&#34; The lack of tangible interaction with the story-line detracts from the experience. Also, a review of the dialog will reveal at least one issue (never is repeated in a phrase...). Good puzzles, but overall experience didn't require this packaging!
0517543052|5.0|this book will absolutely change your life for the better.  take the chance.  it will be worthwhile, i promise you.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|What fun!  The movie &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34; introduces us all to a remarkable man.  As soon as we learned about him, we ordered his cds and enjoy them frequently.  Coming from Reality is my favorite, hands down.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Mikey loves anything to do with this series. He has Downs syndrome, but he does not let that slow him down.  TOM
B003VANOFY|4.0|Sound quality - 7/10 - Average. This is perfectly suited for gaming. Not good for listening to music though.<br /><br />Surround effect - 9/10 - I expected this to be a gimmick but it is not. I was pleasantly surprised to find out how well the surround effect works and is very helpful in gameplay as well.<br /><br />Connection drops - Happened twice.. Not annoying yet.. :)<br /><br />Range - 40 m claimed. Works easily in most living room setups. (Mine's only 10 meters away though)<br /><br />Software - Not too bad. Just had to use it once for setup and then never turned back.<br /><br />Price - I bought it for $50 after some discounts. Full price is $160 which is a little too much for what you get.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|My son MIkey loves the Twilight series. I, personally do not care for these vampire movies, or t.v shows either. He (mikey) watches them over and over again, he just loves them.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A  beautiful story of love, relationships, communication and healing. Well written and engrossing, although a bit predictable. That said, I was sad to see it end.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|The adventures continue. I liked the movie, the budget keeps getting bigger and bigger. The stars get bigger also. Though  Marlon<br />Brando was'nt a cheapo movie star. Good movie, good cast = good movie.  TOM
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Great movie, loved Sandra Bullock's character, loved that it is based on a true story, all the characters seemed natural in their roles (genuine).
0061150142|4.0|Tender, touching and romantic. Written with some intrigue that keeps one turning the pages. Be ready for tears and surprises.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|I play tower defense games more than any other genre and there  is no question that this game and the original Kingdom Rush are among the absolute best. It's endlessly replayable and offers up a lot of interesting and unique extra touches to the standard TD format (eg, the barracks). Cannot recommend this enough.
B00DJ4PIBK|4.0|My daughter loves this set. We bought the Lego Star Wars advent calendar for her brother the past few years, and it was nice to have something similar that she enjoys. (She did not like Star Wars.)
B000SEFNMS|3.0|I read this for a book project I wanted something that would keep me glued. But sadly it keep me wanting more
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Once you play the game a few times, you'll understand this review. That's one more achievement in my collection so far.
B008BTC5E6|3.0|The life and struggles of the ULtra marthonist Jurek from the difficult childhood to adulthood. His search and success of the vege way. Easy to though leaves some questions unanswered
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I have this app on all of my devices. It is amazing how much junk that doesn't normally get deleted. I would definitely recommend!
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Excellent Archer as always. Easy and rapid reading, very enjoyable and gripping. It is very difficult to put down at times. Highly recommended
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I especially like the fact that it is very &#34;local&#34; but would like a little more forecast and rainfall info.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book .  It saw me through a week of the  flu  I wanted a book about President Kennedy.  I have read several Stephen King books and they all kept my attention .  Books like The Shining and The Stand kept me turning the pages , almost too scary at times!  This book however took me back to a past that I remember and also helped me remember things I had forgotten.  Thank you for writing this and for a fine ending.  It's now one of my favorites.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I especially like the fact that it is not so easy as to be boring, but not so hard as to be stressful.  A good pastime.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE......Captivating and interesting read.  Of course I could relate to many of the issues touched on being Nigerian, female, living in the US......I am impressed with how she was able to effortlessly explore experiences in the three separate locations/cultures.  This is a book you want to suggest to (share with, gift to) everyone you know....beautifully written
B00B5HQL50|4.0|David Craig IS BOND!!  The best Bond in the past 15 years.  Too bad that M was killed.  I thought she was the best M
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|This movie explains things as they REALLY are. It is inspired by the events surrounding the JFK assassination, MLK assassination and the Bush administration (911). The clues are in the film and in character names if you study it carefully.<br /><br />[...]
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved it!  Sycamore Row caused sleep deprivation!  I read it until 3am and couldn't put it down.  A must read!
B007URVZJ6|3.0|It is hard to get all worked up about items that that you buy on a web site especially when you required to meet a minimum word count
0670026182|5.0|Beautiful book....enjoy looking at the photos even when I'm not searching for a recipe :)  would be a great gift for any food lover
B008XG1X18|1.0|It is hard to get all worked up about items that that you buy on a web site especially when you required to meet a minimum word count, not my cup of tea
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I started this game and I cant stop it is so fun I just yeah I love it so much!
B00E9A656K|5.0|Not bad, has a few of those requests for real money but what you get from a free game is worth it and every has to make a living. It's challenging and simple all at the same time. Great variety of cars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It has really great devotions and helps me to keep on track.  I love having it on my phone and kindle
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|this is a great way to kill time especially when you have time between flights.  The only thing that i don't like is the battery which means i actually have to put the game down an  wait for it to charge
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This movie has been fantastic time and time again. Don't believe the critics. If you like action, mystery, plot twists, and most importantly, magic you should definitely set some time aside for this one.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Because I  BELIEVE -  still at  my  age ---- the movie  was well done,  the  book, also very good, this  will be a  gift  to  my Grand  Daughters and  I  have  taken  the  Polar  Express train ride - Elkins, West  Virginia.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It does not work  with my district<br />I hate it<br />BOO!<br />Why does happen to me<br />I what to play it
B0063GORYU|1.0|it will not let you move more than one card at a time.............so you can not move a group like 7,8,9 on to a 10 in another pile.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Proving you can make friends in any situation and if you stay positive and work hard, you can absolutely achieve your goals, I think this even topped Monsters Inc. LOVED it.
B00EAZTONU|5.0|I loved the original movie and the extended edition is more of what we expect from a movie like this. I have to admit that some of the extras don't exactly paint the dwarves in a positive light but I think it goes back to why the elves and dwarves don't always spend time together.<br /><br />The figurine came in and looked just like the picture so it was exactly what I expected.<br /><br />The packaging was adequate and it arrived on the day promised.
B00DQR26EC|4.0|Fun to play.  The English is a bit spotty but it is a good old fashioned rpg.  I am enjoying it.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|Its a great game, a little easy in places, but on the most part, great.  A little short though, but I would highly recommend this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much ive had it for 2 years and it is the best app I have ever played. it is so sick. I always join games with my friends when I go outside and I love to download minecraft parodies. also if you could bring back herobrine and add skins every one would love this game also armour in creative thank you notch for creating this you know it is AWESOME LIKE BUDDER. if you don't like video games I gaurentee u will love this one because before I didn't like video games that much so I gaurentee safely that this app is sick and AWESOME LIKE BUDDER
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Probably my favorite read of this year . Moving, colorful, and highly evocative. Read the book before you head off to see the movie.
B00GP1ANXC|1.0|I thought you cloud download maps onto your app it just shows u videos and stuff it would be a lot funner if you could actually put the map on you game :(
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love this clock.  Alarms are so easy to set with a diversity of sounds - and they're loud enough to wake the dead.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|from the looks of it they are copying minecraft and the price is way to high bring it down to atleast 1.50
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book is so disappointing.  I LOVED the first two books in the series, but this one ruined it for me.  I hope the movie producers change the ending otherwise there are going to be a lot of depressed and disappointed movie goers.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Charger works great.  Charged my phone and my wifes phone at the same time with no problems.  We both have iPhone 5S and it works great.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I was looking for a book that had adults and magic in it! I am pleased! I will definitely buy the second one!
0316228532|3.0|Well written but very sad. If you are very happy with your lot in life and need a literary depressant, this book is for you. However, it could work the other way. If you're really depressed you could read this book and think, &#34;Well, could be worse  At least I'm not a meth addict...&#34;
B0067QPVD2|3.0|I really wanted to love this movie. It's not that I didn't like what they were trying to but rather the type of movie made didn't match the type of movie it was acting as a prequel for. The original movie was more of a slow burn, mystery type movie, this was in your face and all action oriented. You could just see everything coming from a mile away. Still the acting was done well and as usual Mark Elizabeth Winstead is likeable in her part but you just don't care. I enjoyed it as a nice flick for what it was but just didn't feel the as I did with the original. The last thing that seemed to start things off on the wrong foot is the whole &#34; We found something and we need an outside expert to look at it, lets dig it up and heed nothing that they say about it.&#34; This seems like the exact smae premise of the atrocious AvP.<br /><br />As a side note the dog in the original was a huge part of the movie... the nonspoken part that really gave the movie a nice feel to it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is a cool game because it is really fun where you play suvival or creative. On survival you can die but t is fn collecting resoures
B002MFULQO|5.0|Well, all of YOU may not realize it and get lost in Oliver Stone's controversial vision. It is a pastiche - a collage - but I can tell you as a longtime Kennedy researcher and everything in the movie is real and accurate and factual and happened - EXCEPT for the meeting with Donald Sutherland in Washington - that never happened. Jim Garrison did not have a 'Deep Throat' to help him or guide his way, and his self-aggrandizing manner is not even touched on in the movie - the main reason he was so discredited and dismissed as a crank just trying to get publicity for himself - it was the way he went about it - and if you read some of his quotes, they do this movie no service. But Oliver Stone does not know who killed JFK - he just knows how it DIDNT happen, that our own government lied to us and covered it up, and that we are ALL owed as Americans to know who killed our president and why. When the National Archives are finally opened up and we can see all of the thousands (seriously, literally, guys, if you don't know look it up) of documents that are STILL deemed 'too sensitive' for us to see and interpret ourselves - lest we get the wrong impression of our way of life, our government, our country, our legacy, and our meaning to the rest of the world - it's that big. This movie is meant to be entertaining, get you up to speed, and open your eyes - with an accomplished filmmaker and an all-star cast, this is easily and adeptly done. Where I live conservatives, Republicans, and Christians still dismiss this movie out of hand - so surprisingly you may find yourself cast as a rebel just for watching it, and will find them completely unfamiliar with any of the facts of the case, and unaware of the glaring inadequacies of the Warren Report. Be informed. Get entertained. It's not the truth - but it will get you asking the right questions - one's we've never been the answers to - and that we are entitled to.
0062082841|5.0|If you are a fan of Guillmero del Toro, you owe it to yourself to get this book!<br />A nice look into the creative mind of del Toro.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game.  I had heard so many people talk about this, that, when it became available on my Kindle Fire, I immediately downloaded it.  Just wish there was a way to continue playing without the wait or without paying for more lives.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was great to the end! It is in my all time favorites and do highly recommend it. Very suspenseful
B00005JLR1|5.0|The best fantasy movie ever about the long lost treasure. Cyber-futuristic, amazing. My 14 yr old LOVES this story! We watch it often. Great lessons in this story too, for all ages.
B00DSO9RMC|4.0|For some reason I found this a little hard to get into initially. I'm generally a huge fan of Pratchett. Having said that, once I'd got comfortably out of the new character introductions and into the story proper, it picked up, and I was unable to put it down.<br />New characters, plus comfortable old ones, and expansion on old political themes really makes this a great successor to THUD!, Going Postal and Making Money.<br /><br />I would happily have given it 5 stars if it had been a bit more grippy at the outset.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I love this app, and can't wait until other publications are added. I got tired of waiting on kindle to be compatible and bought 3 nooks today while they were on sale.  Hopefully it  will soon work on the kindles also.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Too many attempts at taking money.  It's very apparent that's the bottom line and most of the time, you have to be lucky to pass.
B00FGFVMGA|3.0|Finished this game in about an hour. The puzzles were a little too easy for my tastes, but the graphics are great and it was a fun (albeit brief) experience.
B00GGMXSFK|5.0|I have not read Jane Austen till late in life, the more I read the better I like her.  Her insight into the human sensiblilites, even 150 years removed as we are, never fails to impress.  Her wit and satire, so pointedly aimed at the people of her times shows the depth and understanding of our foibles even though the world she inhabits is so long gone.  She lived in a times at once more civilized and less hurried than our own.  We have lost a great deal in the intervening times, and perhaps gained much in the way of material things.  Most of us live at a level of the upper classes of that time, but we certainly lack the sophistication and vision into the motivations and emotions which are the basis of being human.  We are at once closer too and more removed from our fellows.  We know much of what occurs in our world, too much, but lack the insights so clearly delineated by Ms. Austen.  To be invited into her world, to share in the times so long past, to see the world through the eyes of one so eminently a master of observation; this is truly a treat and a gift from a master.  Remember, the things of which she writes, and the actions to which we are allowed witness, were the stuff of everyday life, commonplaces of no consequence to those who lived them; but she saw them as the material of drama, the currents of a tapestry long faded from memory.  How extraordinary.  I wonder what she would make of a trip to the supermarket or a friday night high school football game.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is great! The characters are built up so well. I love how you can see the egos get played out in each actor. I love law and contracts and I like the situations that the lawyers are put through. plus Rachel Zane is a pretty cute paralegal.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Very well put together package - nothing more I'd ask from this set...well other than 3 & 4 be better movies!
0763644765|4.0|My 2 year old girl loves each book we have by Leslie Patricelli, and frequently requests them to be read. Including this one. She loves the last page with all the different panties, although that seemed an abrupt end to me. I think it's the least creative of Patricelli's books that we have but I'm still happy we purchased it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is amazing,addicting you can't stop playing ,but I beat the game and got the award and started over but it gave me a mission to do something I already did it was to buy a nerd repelet. and use it. but I already did that!!!!!!!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This book griped and held me to the bitter end! The writing was so descriptive that I felt as though I could literally &#34;feel&#34; what the characters were going through.  This is my first Donna Tartt book and I cannot wait to start another one.
B004WMKXWM|4.0|Excellent movie, we wanted to watch this and the next film together but Netflicks didn't have them. It helps to watch the two together, since this one is so &#34;gray&#34;, but it matched the book perfectly!
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Creepy Fun! I play these games on my overnight work shifts and scare the crap out of myself every time!
B004JK61K0|5.0|So far, I love it. It is much better than the two other email apps I tried, it lets me sync with my mail when I want it to, not sync whenever it wants, interrupting other things I do. Very efficient and worked well with my Kindle Fire and Yahoo.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Excellent writing, very interesting premise, but slow in the beginning.  Ending is a little trite but given the storyline not too many satisfactory options are available.  Good character development.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I have been a Dr. Who fan for more years than I like to admit. When it came back on I was not disappointed! I loved Christopher Eccleson, he was the perfect &#34;Post War Doctor&#34;. Wish he enjoyed doing it as much as I enjoyed watching, but I understand completely that this was not his bag.
B00005ASHM|5.0|One of the great albums of music. Introduced a whole new sound. The proof is in listening to it. Enuf said.
B00669MFA2|4.0|Fantastic end to the series... true to the book as far as it could go. I will always find the post-battle ending a little wan, but that's not the movie's fault. Good acting, good result. Thanks!
B00FMF3R0I|5.0|Volume 2 &#34;On Air&#34; is great, but the remastered original is barely worthwhile. I can hear a bit of difference (clearer sound on the already better recordings), but if you're a big fan on a budget, don't feel bad for only buying &#34;On Air&#34;. It's about 70% gems, the rest fairly repetitive.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|The details of flying a helicopter in Vietnam combat are brought to life by Robert Mason.  The chaos of Vietnam - on the ground, in the air, and in the rear echelon are illustrated better than any other book I have yet read.
1476729085|4.0|The Rosie Project is the story of Professor Don Tillman, handsome, brilliant, socially inept (as many scholars and brilliant people are). He has had limited to no success with dating. He's quirky and weird. One example is his obsession with guessing the age and BMI of anyone he comes in contact with. That would turn me off completely to a man.<br /><br />Through a series of events, Don comes to the conclusion that it's time to join the marriage club but because of his issues, he concocts a formulaic 32-page questionnaire (16 double-sided pages) (think eharmony) in order to weed out potential wife riff raff. This is a completely scientific endeavor he has named The Wife Project. After each date, he notes mishaps and oddities and rejiggers the project course like a proper scientist would. Of course, Don meets the most unsuitable (in his eyes) prospect imaginable: Rosie Jarman, a perpetually unpunctual barmaid with a mouth like a truck driver. The thing is, Rosie is there to ask Don, as a genetics man, to help find her father, not for the The Wife Project.<br /><br />Don has a lot of issues, including what he calls \\"misdiagnoses\\" of conditions like Asperger's and Autism, among others. There's a particularly funny segment of Don lecturing about Asperger's. As you can imagine, Rosie turns Don's world upside down. But it is through Rosie that Don makes real strides in joining the rest of humanity by learning to accept others as they are and that life is not a science experiment.<br /><br />The author, Australian playwright, Graeme Simsion has written this (darkly) comic look at unconventional and non-conformist people trying to fit into models of social convention. The book moves quickly and the characters, for the most part, have depth and humanity but in a Big Bang Theory kind of way.<br /><br />I'm not 100% sure this book will be for everyone because of some of the portrayals of certain medical conditions and through some of Don's personal philosophies and rantings but it is a fast and humorous look at one man's struggles with love and life overall.it is a fast and humorous look at one man's struggles with love and life overall.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This app is probably for people who like You Tube.  i went on it to search for something I had read about and that's about it.  Haven't used it since.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Boring movie, not much action. The plot was all that it was showed to be. Was highly disappointed. A big let dowm
B009RH9J7W|4.0|I just purchased the basic case for the kindle.  It works as it is supposed to. Nice rotation to work in whatever position you have your Kindle in.  Like the elastic thing that keeps it shut, and the standing feature to keep it upright when using Pandora, or watching movies while in the kitchen.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Play this all the time, helps the grand children learn how numbers go, and helps woth a few shapes and colors
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I used to like the weather channel much more before, then they got all streamlined on me, and it doesn't give as much information as I'd like it to.  Then, there's all these pop-ups that are annoying!  Wish they'd go back to their original format.
B006C45MRE|5.0|Awesome movie, great actors and plot, even the grand kids want to watch it every time they come to visit
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book was wonderful. Picked it up the day before Thanksgiving, and read straight through the holiday. Lovely writing, devastatingly relatable.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Great workout.  Probably geared to someone a little younger  - had to modify because of my knees but did enjoy the exercise.  Don't remember why I stopped other than maybe I found another better suited to this 65 yr old body.  Might even go back to try it again at a later date as I've kept in my exercise library.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I think the book is really interesting. Sometimes it drags a little, but really a very endearing story of a small little girl who really grows up too fast during and in Nazi Germany.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|easy to read and informative. really enjoyable. it's engaging and easy to read. it does not cover the full scope of presidents' accomplishments but focuses primarily on the relationships between the presidents.
006202406X|1.0|If youn read the first two books, I'm sure you are excited about reading Allegiant. But I warn you, it ruins the whole series. A shame because I planned to start back own Divergent when I finished Allegiant. Now I cringe when I see them in my ibook library. I may just delete them all! I pray they re-write this for the movie. And thank God for fanfiction! After chapter 47 I switched to fan fiction and let the fans tell the ending. There are some really good ones out there. In my mind it was a happy ending. But what's beyond the fence was also boring so even without killing the person we are all cheering for, it was a bad wrap up to what started out as a great trilogy. She could of taken this places! Even a fourth book. But she for some reason decided to tank her series so that instead of ranking amongst the best series, it's now on the \\"not\\" recommended list. Just a shame.....
1937053571|5.0|Jennifer is one hell of a story teller, I don't know how she does it.Not only was this book sweet and romantic but jammed pack full of action. I was glad to see enemies put their difference aside and work together and i seen a side of Seth which warmed my soul.
B00AVFO41K|5.0|So addicting. I just want to play it all the time and try to beat my best score. It's challenging and really makes you think...ahead. It is my favorite game on my Kindle.  Sometimes, however, it just stops working in the middle of the game and that's very frustrating when you are about to pass your high score!  Also it will not keep your score unless you are in an area with wi-fi.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing, Amazing device. We use this in the bedroom with our second TV where we don't have a cable box or gaming console for streaming. Recently added HBO GO
B00EPFEY44|5.0|I've enjoyed Bocelli's voice and music for some years now.  This CD is the perfect compliment to my Bocelli collection.
B00EB6ENXO|2.0|I only snagged this cause a friend gave me his Ultraviolet certificate. Horrible movie. The last two thirds are trite, shallow and appear to have been written by a 14 year old.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played.  It's interesting,challenging and requires strategic moves to win the game. Never boring!
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|Just like his last 3 albums this one has 3 songs that are REALLY good, well worth the price of the whole album.<br /><br />New, Queenie Eye and Early Days are superb songs, with that special unique McCartney magic that has made so famous.<br />The rest of songs are fillers and nothing to call home about.<br /><br />However if you are are a macca fan, and you realize how amazing it is for him to still be giving us some awesome music at 72 years of age, you will keep abusing the repeat button on those 3 songs.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|It was a great few hours, but believe me, you will get lost - no worries, though, since it has a map to guide you, and a walkthrough if you get stuck.  Good fun!
B00DYCHPMC|5.0|Wow! Amazing! The extras are well worth the purchase. I just hope they do the same thing with future albums!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm a penny pincher, so I have to admit that when I saw this game I hesitated paying the $1.99 for it, despite it's high ratings.  I wish I hadn't!  It's a stunning feat of computer graphics combined with supreme puzzles.  Escape into The Room this weekend and have yourself a little &quot;stay-cation&quot;!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Really good book and part of our history that I didn't know about.  We read it at book club and everyone loved it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i had this on the computer and now on my kindle. lots of fun but it's very distracting when you can play it any time and any where.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|II loved this book.  It's full of complex, fully-realized characters.  Chief among them is Alma Whittaker, a Philadelphia botanist living in the 19th century, driven by curiosity and a passion for learning, but awkward and unattractive as a woman, but she is surrounded by a family of unique individuals who fairly leap off the page -- her father, Henry Whittaker, a self-made man; her mother Beatrix, a strict and virtuous Dutch wife; and her adopted sister, Prudence, who realizes all too early the dangers to which her unusual beauty subjects her.  Then there is the love of her life, Ambrose Pike, who aspires to be and angel and whose other-worldly spirituality contrasts with Alma's scientific search  for knowable causes. Then there are the people she meets in Haiti.<br /><br />Alma is not only an intellect; she is also a sexual being.  I found it quite wonderful that this novel explores female sexuality with honesty and candor, but without prurience.  Both the plain Alma and the beautiful Prudence find sexuality to be a difficult problem that must be solved.<br /><br />I also loved the descriptions of Alma's scientific investigations, which for me as a trained biologist, were fascinating.<br /><br />Finally, If you are curious about early female scientists, please read &#34;The Discovery of Jeanne Baret,&#34; who was a real female botanist of the previous century and the first woman to circumnavigate the globe.  You'll find it fascinating.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I was addicted to Freecell for years on PC. So excited to fund it for Kindle. Let the addiction commence.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It works effectively and looks nice also it's incredibly easy to use and you can, unlike most other calculators, can do fractions.
0307931803|5.0|Our favorite Dr. Seuss book, we are so happy they finally made it into a board book. Everyone loves reading this!
B005MJFA2W|5.0|Excellent book, the more you read the better it gets... to the point you have to thank Prof. Daniel Kahneman that he wrote a long book... And by the end you say it's a shame he haven't  spent another 50 or 60 year researching, because if he had another 500 pages to write I'm sure they would be worth to reading!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is the best you can not beat it there are none like this. It is so very very awsome
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|So Funny!  What a crack up!.. Watch this movie if you need a laugh! If you like comedy and Jennifer then watch this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun I can't get enough I love it ans my friend love it also. If u download this I assure that u won't be disappointed
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This is my son's review of the book:  Did not like it that much. Was slow so that's why I rated it three stars. My opinion for this book is maybe read if you like slow paced action.
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game is cool it allows you full control over your own city I highly recommend it please get it o my downside is you don't have that much space to work with
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|Fun adventure, beautiful scenery, fun puzzles and not terribly difficult. I was pleasantly surprised by this app and enjoyed playing it. I finished in one sitting and enjoyed every moment of it. I appreciated that clues were available as I did get stuck once or twice. Definitely a worthwhile app to download.
0385350864|5.0|Loved it.  I know others will hate it, but there's a truth to Fielding's writing that I love, even though she may take Bridget to the extreme. Sure, we might not all be LIKE her, but I'd argue there's a little bit of her in all of us. If you choose to read, don't judge.  Just read and enjoy your old friend Bridget.
B007SPPANM|5.0|Great movie...it still holds up after all these years. It was remastered in 2012 and it is quite a gem to behold PROPERLY (finally) on DVD!<br /><br />Great sound, great picture and the story was nice too. Titanic is a modern day classic...there's a reason it grossed so much at the box office! SPOILER ALERT: The ship sinks at the end.<br /><br />My one and only regret/disappoint was that the DVD does not include a lot of extras. The two disc set is for the movie and deleted scenes only. The Blu-ray version is jam-packed with extras and for an extra bit of money I should have went that route. Had I known there were so few special features I would have. Oh well...should've done more research.
B002QQ8HAG|2.0|I HATED this movie. I LOVE fashion, but it was not what I expected. I can see where the movie &#34;The Devil Wears Prada&#34; took from it, but I love that movie! Anna Wintour is definitely no actress, as I did not expect her to be-- but it was so dry and boring. It was entirely too long. I did find it interesting at some points, in regards to the production of the infamous September Issue and the very brief & short moments that Anna Wintour [infamous ice queen] shows a bit of a maternal side by showing a few moments with her daughter. I think this was the part that I liked the most, just because it humanized her a little bit.  Other than that, I was bored to tears. If you're not seriously interested in EVERY in & out of the fashion industry, then pass on this movie... or at least pass on spending any money on it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is WAY too much fun!  Annoying when you get on a level that takes days to beat, but I thoroughly LOVE playing it!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the book! I liked the book better than the movie. This is not always true, as I generally always view each the book & movie as stories that compliment each other, rather than one being &#34;better&#34; than the other. I felt the book let you get to see more insight into Pat's neurotic behavior, rather than him just being &#34;weird&#34; or short tempered.<br /><br />  Bradley Cooper starred in SLP: The Movie, so of course I was going to check it out! lol.  I found this movie oddly disturbing.  It's got a fantastic eerie feeling, however.  The best way to describe is that it &#34;feels like you're always only the verge of something...&#34; - like something big is right around the corner, but it doesn't ever quite happen.  As much as I like Bradley, I found his character a little off-putting. I LOVED that he had no filter. I loved that he made me laugh... But there was something in his delivery; the cadence of his voice that annoyed me!  You'll have to see it. It's a creative love story.  And of course, Robert DeNiro, my favorite Mafia crush, was in the movie. I loved his character, too.  I won't give away the movie, but I will say that it is worth seeing-- but maybe at the Matinee  or reduced price nights.  I think if you only shell out a few bucks, you'll receive it much better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun and also good for the brain.  BUT for us &#34;older&#34; and I probably mean 35 and up.  Clear all the jelly's does not mean - what I call jelly beans - they are see through squares.  I'm still getting use to it but I do like it.  It's very addictive.
030758836X|5.0|I love this book! it's so gripping & keeps you on the edge of your seat! It's one of those books you cannot put down! I love how there are two parts in the book, and each part has you feeling different ways about the characters. There are a few twists & unexpected turns that have you screaming OUT LOUD in shock/ Disbelief/anger, what have you. If you love a great Thriller, get this book!
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|This game is awesome. I would recommend this game to anyone. It's easy to learn and to play. Both my wife and I play this game.
0525952926|5.0|Love his writing. I've waited for this book and was not disappointed. He's a great writer and I will look forward to more.
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|Plot was thin. Wasn't expecting an AA session from the title. Combined with absurd flight scenes, this just wasn't a serious movie.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Great movie. I purchased this as a Christmas gift. Fast shipping and is nice and new. I can't wait for my boyfriend to open it
0321934318|2.0|There is just too much flipping back and forth in this book for me to get a coherent sense of the software and  how to work with it.  LR5 is my first experience with Lightroom in general, so that may be part of my problem with the book...  But as I go step by step... (1) the screens in the book do not match the screens in the software so following the instructions is not possible and  (2) a logical sequence of material just isn't there page by page.. and I'm no further than importing and organizing images.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow I don't think anyone really knew what would happen its good and sad ending but at least very satisfying
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Ok, sometime the screen freezes and you lose coins and bingos. It's hard to get credits. Other then that it's fun to play!!!!!!!!!!!
0399157573|1.0|I, too have read all of Cornwell's books and this one is so disappointing.  The story was contrived and really not much more than a Scarpetta monologue.  It was banal and boring.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I frigging love this series! it was a bit slow at first however, now it is really starting to pick up!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I think the biggest sin of this movie is that it makes the audience pay attention and think instead of just sit back and be entertained.  As such some found this way too confusing.  I did too for the first 15 minutes or so, but then I started to see it weave together like a tapestry and it got more and more interesting because it really didn't have to fit together on all levels to work on all levels.  The movie was a bit long, but it basically needed to be for all it undertook.  I can't imagine how long the editing process must have been.<br /><br />As for the cinimematography....All I can say is WOW!  One of the most visually beautiful film I've eveeer seen...and I've only seen it on my own TV.  I bet the big screen at the theatre was really stunning.<br /><br />If you don't like to think much wwhile being entertained then you'll most likely find this confusing and/or boring.  If you like movies that keeps you on your toes and offers different perspectives than what you're used to....You're going to love this movie
B00CE03UOC|4.0|easy but fun.  helps to clear my mind of other things.  I like all of the flow games.  needs to be a little more challenging.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its the hot stuff and what not. been rocking out with it since I bought it earlier this morning. I recommend it. its better than temple run cuz this has missions to complete
B0091THRCU|1.0|Overpriced! Got a much cheaper product that does a better job. The inside collects dirt very easily. The outside &#34;leather&#34; wears out pretty soon and looks very old.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|nice app it frees up a lot of space for Nova 3 .you need a lot of room for this game....
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Gifted the item, and they love it. Great buy for the price. Easy to install and very smooth streaming. I heats up after a while, which always bothers me.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I'm a movie collector, plus no need to mention that those are great movies. Good picture quality, it has glitches, but then again nothing is or was meant to be perfect, plus I got the indiana jones movies on sale from amazon.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|fun and easy to play. good way to use some free time. I would recommend this to all.  very good price.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|I love this series.  The acting is great.  I know the next season will be even better than this season
1616550414|4.0|Has a lot of fun information.  The reason I didn't give it 5 is because it was decidedly lacking in information on the games before Wind Waker (other than Ocarina).  Especially because my favorite in the series is A Link to the Past
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Shaun the Sheep is probably the best kids show out there.  There is no dialog (so no vernacular your kids can pick up that you might not appreciate), it is clean, it is hilarious, and the humor will appeal to kids, parents and grandparents alike.  This is a good reason to be a Prime member.<br /><br />Season 2 is great.  Much of the same stuff that is in Season 1 with a few new characters introduced, more detailed animation, and HD.
B00G21YLF6|5.0|This is one of the most exciting and enlightening episodes in the New Who.  Up there with other of my favorite episodes like The Impossible Planet and Blink
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I haven't read any of John Grisham's books recently, but, as \\"Sycamore Row\\" is a sequel to \\"A Time to Kill,\\" I decided to venture into that Mississippi hamlet once again. I gave the book 3 stars because it held my interest to the end, although there were a couple of times when I wished the author would just \\"get on with it.\\" Unfortunately, I was not surprised as to the reason the deceased multi-millionaire left 90% of his fortune to his African-American maid, a woman he had only known for a few years: the author was giving out hints as though they were perfume samples at Macy's, but the actual reveal was quite moving. The meeting with the judge at the very end of the book, after the verdict was announced, was strange, and while I think it was a fair resolution it seemed somewhat out of sync with the rest of the book.<br /><br />As usual in a Grisham novel, there is not much in the way of literary style, but no one should be surprised at that. Grisham is an author of popular, best-selling fiction, not of books destined for college classroom discussions except perhaps in a course on popular culture, but he is a good story teller. Character development is not his long suit in some of his novels, and this one is somewhere right in the middle -- but then we already know many of these characters from \\"A Time to Kill,\\" so perhaps the author felt justified in putting more effort into the plot than in other aspects. The maid Lettie was probably the most developed of the characters when she was allowed to have a chapter, or a portion of a chapter, to herself. SMALL SPOILERs: I was expecting the author to allow Lettie to explain, even if only in an interior monologue, an event that had happened several years prior to the opening of the book, an event that was a courtroom bomb shell, as they say. Unfortunately, her reaction was relayed by her second daughter Portia instead of us being allowed to hear it directly. Lettie's drunken husband conveniently disappears from the action in an uncharacteristic fit of remorse. END SPOILERS.<br /><br />I think this one will be for die-hard fans of Mr Grisham, or those who particularly enjoyed \\"A Time to Kill\\" and want to reacquaint themselves with characters from that work.in an uncharacteristic fit of remorse.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best app for anyone who wants to connect with the Word of God on a daily basis no matter where you are. I committed to reading the Bible in a year multiple times in the past but never got it done. This app has helped me actually stay on course and now I'm on day 335. Not to mention the fact that I have been able to use the other plans to help me stay with finding Scriptures that talk about the struggles I or a loved one may be going through. Best app ever!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It is a fine streamer for 1/3 the price of Apple TV or many Roku. The services you can stream from are limited, although they may expand in the future. One real let down is that it only streams from the cloud. I wish it would stream media directly from my devices instead of Chromecast acting merely as a way to turn my phone into a very cool and super cheap media remote control. In our case, we live in a rural place without dependable high speed internet and very limited download bandwidth. So the ability to stream media files locally from my mobile device directly to the dongle would mean I could (for example) purchase a movie in the Google Play Movies app, download the media when I am near a good internet connection (pre-caching the media is called &#34;pinning&#34; in google Play Music and Movies), and then cast them locally to my TV when I get home. THIS DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. Even if I have pinned a movie on my device, Chromecast will still try to download the media content from the cloud, clobbering my daily internet quota. But again, this is a strictly rural issue in the US. If you have great or even normal internet connection capable of streaming video, you have plenty to be happy about with this $35 streamer. If you are rural, or have limited bandwidth, get a mobile device with and HDMI output. That &#34;wired&#34; solution works great with pinned Google Play Movies.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Not too easy and not too complicated. My kids even love to play it! Very fun, definitely deserves 5 stars
B008O9V4C2|4.0|As with his other solo projects, these tracks are similar to Steely Dan material. Co-producer Michael Leonhart contributes on numerous instruments including Trombonium(?).  Some tracks have the funk turned up a bit from the usual. Definitely recommended for Steely Dan fans.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|I loved this. Was great to see 10 &11 working together and fixing their past. And to know that gallifrey is not lost was awesome. I also liked the time lord art. Bigger on the inside.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Modern classic with a blu-ray loaded down with TONS of bonus content.  Not to mention INCREDIBLE sound and picture.  And at THIS price?  Amazing bargain.
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|1. Too many special effects.<br />2. Action scenes are so fast moving, you can't really get into them. When Superman takes off or is flying, its so fast, you can't really see it.<br />3.There are all kinds of artifacts, probably because the camera is pointing at a light source - even in indoor scenes.<br />4. The script is pitiful, Zog has the same lines throughout the movie.<br />5. There are no feel good scenes or humor except for Clark appearing in the last scene - way too late.<br />6. Did they hire someone with advanced Parkinson's disease to hold the camera.<br />7. The 3D affects were pitiful. I don't want to see spears coming out of the screen, but one had to concentrate too see that it was really in 3D.<br /><br />I was very disappointed. The Amazon price should have been $2.50, not $25. And that includes tax!!
032147404X|5.0|I like the way author tries to share his photography knowledge and experience. There is no theory or detailed analysis but surely gives a new perspective to the reader. It is more like a collection of conversations with the expert on important topics.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Great series.  Good price. Husband loves it.  He is zombie crazy.  Loves him some zombies.  So, if you are into this and want to know how to survive the zombie apocolypse, good series.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|good hub but a little big for the computer bag. usb 3.0 seems to work fine but haven't tested the speed.
006202406X|5.0|I LOVE these books. In fact, GASP, I like them better than the Hunger Games.  I am excited to see the movie.  As with any books, make sure you are giving it to an age appropriate/content appropriate reader.  I let my 12/13 year old son read them.  I would let a bit younger age but I don't think they would GET it.  It's not that the content is bad.  But, this series has deep ideas that would get lost on a reader who can't process and understand the connections and emotional trials.  I do suggest talking to your child if you allow them to read this.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book took a while to get into because of the shifting POVs between chapters. Then I did, and it was okay. I felt like the backstory of the Bureau was never explained enough for my liking.<br /><br />I also generally don't like it when two characters seem destined to end up together. Like in other teen-oriented dystopian novel series. But Tris dying was a total and complete letdown for me. I would rather them ended up together. Shifting the focus to Tobias after Tris's death told me that this series was about him the whole time, that Tris didn't matter so much. That was disappointing to me because I felt like Tris was a fantastically strong and flawed character that young women could look up to.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|I am usually not a sci fi person, but I LOVE this show!!!  the characters are well developed, they look after each other and it's hard to pick a favorite.  I also love comedy mixed in with my action!  so sad when the show was over.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever watched.  It is definitely entertaining... Love it.  I recommend this show highly.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Good game to past time nothing difficult. Story line was actually good too. I enjoyed it but there could have been more to it for the money.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was awesome!! I read it In one day from 8:00 am to 8:30 pm. I think this one might even be better then the firs t.even though it was a little bit confusing at the end.<br /><br />XOXOXO<br />Ari
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This is one of my favorite family movies.  Our grandson and grandaughter love it, as do our teenage and college age sons.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Nudity was not necessary in the beginning of the movie and was to explicit.<br />Movie was a good lesson for all concerning alcoholism.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This book was different and fun. Very unpredictable and mysterious with funny, odd characters and intriguing insights into technology and old world. Loved it.
B000T433CO|5.0|I LOVED this movie! It was warm, cozy, funny, heartwarming.  It was everything you want from a holiday movie.  I'm actually going to go ahead and purchase it so I can watch it every holiday season.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I don't even like werewolves but I loved this series. Stiefvater is a great storyteller with well flushed out, beautiful characters, funny dialogue and interesting twists and turns. Love her writing, love this series. Read it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Cute game. Mindless fun, while hubby is watching something that does not interest me in the least. Levels up fairly quickly.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Was hesitant on renting this movie, but it was actually worth the rental fee.  Very funny and has a scene that will make you laugh and yell out loud.
0525478817|5.0|Holt McDougal, a man who swept into the YA scene with the grace and humble nature of fishing boat proceeding into the marina. Instead of the ocean's bounty, McDougal once again brings us a hefty number of pearls, insight into the true nature of life and as death. My favourite line, and one I'm sure I'll quote to my children for years to come was, &#34;I believe the lasagna wants to be noticed. I think that all pasta-based meals are inherently biased toward the consciousness, and it is a miracle of your mother's cooking that her food may possess some form of sentience. And who am I, a mere human, to tell this lasagna that may or may not be smart enough to run for Congress, that it-or my observation of it-is temporary?”<br /><br />I said this to boss the other day, and he replied, &#34;Well, Burt, that's nice and all, but if you're going to tell me the lasagna has no edge I'll take a middle piece.&#34; And then he gave me a promotion, because that is the kind of inspiration and recognition the fans of Holt McDougal instill in others after partaking in his wisdom.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is a delicious all-day sucker of a novel.  It engages the reader from the first sentence and carries her along on a wild ride until the end.  Theo, the protagonist, is sometimes pathetic, sometimes lovable, sometimes aggravating and disappointing, but always gripping.  The other characters are equally fascinating and well-developed.  They are strange and outside our experience, yet somehow believable.  The plot has just enough surprises to skirt the bounds of credence.  &#34;The Goldfinch&#34; has been called Dickensian, and that it is.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Tim Allen and dorky Sci Fi, really does anything more need to be said?  Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub and Enrico Colantoni just made it that much better.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Totally fell in love with this book!  Can't wait to read the following books . I will definitely recommend reading this series!
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|Between the explicit sex scenes and drug taking, I could not watch what should have been an exciting film. Denzel - I expected a lot more from you. You should be ashamed of yourself. Between the drug taking and F words, when did you find time to act?  Give this one a miss unless you like your mind being dragged through filth.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked the game, but I am disappointed that it ended after 10 floors.  I was just getting into it.  Looking forward to more levels.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|1) Not good compatibility with excel spreadsheets<br />2) Poor support to utf<br />3) No support to open document format<br />We are hoping for improvements. I continue, however, to follow this app! But, at the moment, there are better alternatives in the market.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a fun app. It's free. Try it! You won't be losing anything, well.... I lied. I lost productivity time because I don't want to stop playing this app.
0143119680|1.0|I must admit that I'm a bit ashamed of myself for ever having bought this sickening, convoluted, boring ball of fluff.<br /><br />The book starts off interesting enough with a premise I'd never seen before (a witch who unearths a magical manuscript and then gets the attention of every other witch in the world, etc.), but it quickly shifts into a pretty lame story about a thirty-year-old witch with the mind of a fifteen-year-old girl (who somehow has tenure?!) who could believably trip over a ladybug getting tossed over the &#34;broad muscular shoulders&#34; of the world's most incredibly dull vampire.<br /><br />Their passionless romance involves heavy amounts of yoga, eggs and bacon, wine drinking (seriously, the vampire is a complete alcoholic), tea drinking and sleeping (or lackluster bundling...). I found myself turning pages hoping for something to happen only to be blindsided by some sort of immense description of Mathew Clairmont's exceedingly stupid past or Diana's utter weakness (which the author consistently insists is the purest of bravery).<br /><br />Aside from being dull and weak, Diana is also horrible to her family; specifically, her two aunts who she consistently ignores throughout the book until she finally goes back to her home with her vampire husband and attempts to set her loving aunt on fire!!<br /><br />Yeeeeaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh.... ok?<br /><br />I'll finish this cruddy novel on principle but I think I'll spare myself the sequel. I'd advise anyone who loves to read to do the same.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|good app.  Easier to find conncection on the web with this application.  Need a better way to promote this app
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use kindle for reading... no definitions or bookmarking or anything, just simple reading. And fornwhat I need, its perfect.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is incredibly fun.  I especially love the varied challenges.  This was an excellent free game. I highly recommend it.  It certainly makes the time go by fast.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|While I enjoyed the story  - it just wasn't as well written as some of his later novels.  I wanted to go back and catch the origins of Harry Hole.  Story was captivating but I thought all the Aboriginal stories and side tales were a bit distracting and be-labored the point.
B002NXOQF2|4.0|Point: Stories form who we are.<br /><br />Path: The reader follows a band of rabbits who leave their warren in search of a life where they can be free to live in peace. Following their maturing leader the group faces unexpected adventures and is forced to outthink, outrun, and outperform their enemies. All along the way they are encouraged and challenged by the stories of a greater rabbit who once lived, or perhaps who lives very near.<br /><br />Sources: This story is the fruit from long walks on the hills of England, lengthy conversations with scientists, and the imagination of young children.<br /><br />Agreement: Although at times I laughed at myself for listening to a story like this, I grew more and more attached to the characters. I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Personal App: The stories I listen to and the heroes I follow will shape who I become.<br /><br />It would be worth another read and I would recommend it. I look forward to reading it again with my children.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|An awesome story, acting was excellent, sends the true meaning of Christmas. Note that it is not the colorized version. It is black and white, as it was intended.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This item is best value for money that you could get right now. Also it allows you to stream video and music from any stored media on your network. Very cool
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Easy to advance without further purchases. Good game with mini games within the hidden object game. Objects aren't in the same spot in the same scene, makes it more challenging and fun.
1452117160|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3LER7GK5APTC8]]Disney's Frozen is quite a visual contrast from the previous warm and lively Tangled.<br /><br />First thing you should know is there are spoilers in the book. They appear in the form of storyboards as well as concept art for the finale sequence. So if you intend to watch the film, I suggest you read the book after the film.<br /><br />This is a nice artbook. 160 pages. Hardcover. The concept art consist of storyboards, character designs, environment designs, props and motifs. There are also wonderful photos from the research road trip in Norway.<br /><br />The environment paintings are wonderful, especially those by production designer David Womersley, Jim Finn, Lisa Keane and James Finch. Some are really scenic, such as the setting of a castle by the lake in the valley, or the aurora beyond the mountains. The designs for the town houses are also beautiful, actually quite close to the research photos which are great to begin with.<br /><br />Character designs are for the main ones, Anna and Elsa, of course, and also Kristoff the ice harvester, Olaf the snowman, Hans and other miscellaneous characters. They look good, very Disney-like as compared to Pixar. They look like they can be from the same universe as Tangled. Anna and Elsa kind of look like Rapunzel from Tangled except for the very different costumes and hairstyle.<br /><br />There are more than 10 pages devoted to storyboards. While good, personally I would have prefer more character and environment art.<br /><br />The commentary is an enjoyable read that focuses on the story and storytelling. It really gives insight into the characters and film design, on how and why they are designed the way they are, and how they have changed from the story pitching stage to the final CG production.<br /><br />It's a cool artbook worth checking out for fans of the movie.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B0035LMTZA|4.0|Fun action and excitement with an all-star cast.  Not one for thinking about, just watch and enjoy.  Makes for a great afternoon filler.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Touching story unexpected ending.  Interesting perspective told through the eyes of a child. You find yourself thinking about other things that may be happening \\"medicinal sherry\\".
0451419243|5.0|Epic follow to Fall of Giants. Maybe lacks a bit in character development, but it's still an engrossing read and will consume a week of your life.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel is a timeless dude, I first saw him in that show the Pelican Brief.  You just can't but help thinking that if he was in your life that he would be a great friend.  This movie was totally predictable if you are a airline pilot or even a mechanic, the reason I say mechanic is because I was one for about 16 years.  That was the sorriest job I ever had or ever will.  Screw drinking.  I used to have to work 16 hours a flippn day(mandatory), sometimes 3 or 4 days in a row, for s*** money as well.  It's a damn wonder that this s*** doesn't happen more often.  BELEIVE me,  There is not an airline out there that can't kiss my lily white.  Yea I made this about me, so freakn' what!
B003M70O5O|5.0|I started taking my Kindle to the gym so I could ride the exercise bike while watching. Before I know it, 30 minutes are up and I have to start another 30 so I can finish the episode.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love this game!!! The best Trading Card Game i've played. I just buy this game by US$5.00 in Black Friday, and it has become the most played game i use i  my tablet. Recommended for those fans of trading card games.

B003IEJZUG|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down.  It had me from the beginning to end.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B002MFULQO|5.0|Incredible acting by Kevin Costner! Very gripping and heartfelt story to find the &#34;whole&#34; true behind the murder of JFK. I loved this film. I was intrigued and fascinated from beginning to end! GREAT movie, wonderful story, interesting personalities, characters, and a fantastic story.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|This was for my husband to read.  He enjoyed it very much.  Kindle books are easy to purchase and download.  He would highly recommend this book to others.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It was a little bit slow at the beginning and I believe I've read that one person remarked that this is a youth type book.  I could understand this for the fact that it would have be a beginning novel for someone who was interested in this period of time of the Nazi revolt.  I don't know too many teens and from what I see on the shelves it stores that they read is all about vampires.  Sorry but there is more to life then that type of writing.  This is just a nice book to venture into and hopefully I'll get to see the movie.
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|Season 5 is what I considered the best of the series. Taking place sometime after the Season 4 finale Darth Maul and Savage Oppress decide to make a mark on the galaxy and become the most feared force in the galaxy. The season as it progresses becomes darker, for example Darth maul gets his mechanical foot shot off and Savage looses his arm to Obi Wan in the first episode. The series begins to feel like the original trilogy instead of the prequels. The season finale leaves a warm feeling in your heart and if you're a die hard fan will have you tear up a bit. The fights are great and the lightsaber duels are hardcore and have evolved since Anakin and Ashoka's fight from season 3. Season 5 is my favorite season and can't wait till Season 6 comes out!
B00F522C7C|5.0|Perfect, No issues. It was wrapped and shipped brand new. I was happy that I got it for such a good price because target is selling it for 19.99 :)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Do not waste your time reading  Allegiant. This series started off really well and then progressively went from bad to worse.
B0087HT36U|5.0|he likes fighting. he also loves the fireballs.  he loves the oil barrels. he likes the pirates world.he likes helping the peasants and destroying the bad guys. he likes the cannons and the wooden ones.
B00G3P6VA4|5.0|IMHO, An excellent film. Great to see real heroes who are genuine people. Here is my critique.<br /><br /> Nice to see that the main actor  speaks languages other than American English in the film. It was also nice to see that sentiment ,humanism, and morality have reappeared in a very good epic. They even dared to show the influence of a Catholic nun on the young hero's upbringing. How many writers and movie producers have marginalized ethics and religion these days? It seems that there is a strong bias against anything smacking of spirituality and/or religion appearing in films. (With the exception of movies that are called strictly spiritual or religious or fantastic movies about the supernatural. Not that these are bad movies, the point is that we have forgotten our past and the ethical traditions that built Western Civilization.) We need to look at the history of ethics and remember that many brave men and women of the past have derived their faith and inspiration from religion/spirituality. There is  a strong secular bias in our culture against showing characters in movies who are really human and hold humanistic values. Most action heroes focus on violence, revenge, egotism, money, glory.<br /><br />  This hero (flawed in the sense that he was once a thief) changed his behaviour and focused on those he loved and on humanity in general-in fact he willingly gave up his life for those he loved ( a very Christian way of looking at life and an example of practicing your beliefs to the point of death.)
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever made.  It's imaginative and shows what life would be like if it never changed.  Bill Murray is perfect.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I've read  hundreds of books but never one that I've felt so compelled to say something about. Now committed  I'm afraid I can't do it justice. All I can say with honesty and in my most persuasive voice is.....Read this one!!!!!!!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I'm a Supernatural addict.  I like shows with monsters, etc. and I like how the good guys win (most of the time).
1451626088|5.0|Great Read......<br />Love the author and her style of writing.....enjoyed this novel after having seen &#34;The White Queen&#34; on Starz.....loved it and this book as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I know there are some people who didn't like it, but it was great. It really brings into focus what soldiers go through when they return. The horrors they see cannot be deleted, but they are expected to go on as nothing happened.<br />Definitely a fitting end to this trilogy.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|I could not play it on my iMac running Mavericks OS using Chrome browser. how can I play it this clip?
0316055433|2.0|This novel is blessed with a very strong opening for the first several hundred pages at a literary quality that I would compare favorably and seriously to Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\"  That is, the plight of adolescence gone awry compounded by multiple tragedies well perceived and sensitively delineated by the author.<br /><br />Having said that, the subsequent chapters are less well developed and compromised.  There is, for example, a \\"Sidekick\\" who is central to the plot but who converses in stilted and broken English over the course of about 450 pages. Which turns out to be persistently annoying and distracting. Moreover, this character is given a stereotypical, \\"Lovable and garrulous Slav,\\" persona prone to repetitive and long-winded soliloquies.<br /><br />Subsequently, one's head begins to spin as the plot falls from sublime elevations to nitty-gritty thriller material.  Where things get very complicated and confounded by multiple Eastern European types with similar names and nicknames.  Where characters engage in endless philosophizing on the meaning of life and art. I should mention, also, what appears to be an unfortunate misspelling or typo, on page 750, where the word \\"planting\\" seems to be used instead of \\"painting\\".<br /><br />In sum, this novel reads as two different books. And the overall impact is one of disappointment.  I`ve thus far avoided reading any of the 500 or so reviews submitted before this one, but wouldn't be surprised if others have reached the same or a similar conclusion.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Convoluted involved multi-track story that follows believable characters in life-altering but ordinary events.  Woven very skillfully and subtly. Highly recommended.
8866135879|5.0|Perfect for toting in a purse. I take this to and from work every day, and I've found it to be a good size for daily use. Sometimes I wish there was more space for writing, but most days this functions perfectly. Very durable, and the red cover makes it easy to spot in a bag.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|The book begins with a scene from her brother's funeral. Megan is new to this small town, and this isn't the entrance she wanted to make. Instead of joining her brother in the place he now calls home, Megan is standing at his graveside for his funeral. She put of visiting her brother, and then it was too late.<br />You know that Megan is running from something, but you don't know what that something else. It's more terrible than you can imagine, unless you've lived through it yourself.<br />In Pride, Megan finds the family that took in her brother, and they've now taken her in as well. She's not sure that she's ready to stay in Pride, or if she's only staying long enough to take care of her brother's affairs after his death. What she does know is that the family - and town - that befriended her brother are the nicest, friendliest people that she'll be safe and happy for the duration.<br />What Megan doesn't expect is to find a man who wants to be with her, in a way that's very different from the way she's been treated in the past.<br />This is a gripping tale of Megan finding herself, and finding a whole new family as well.<br /><br />1 star subtracted because of poor (or non-existent) editing and grammar. I love, love, love that more people are able to write books because of the ease of ebooks, but it makes for a difficult read, sometimes, without proper editing.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love love love this series out was no surprise how much I liked this book, this book is a great gift for Christmas and good anyone who loves comedy like me once again Jeff Kenny has written an amazing book! Great Work

When I went to log into said either:<br />Error or Its taking to long to log in please try again later.<br />I wish you can fix this app and he  it running again.

B00F35BV64|5.0|This is a good movie, especially if you are a star trek fan.  I would recommend watching it. We have twice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My son and I are having a great time . We were disappointed when it wasn't available.......thrilled when it was!!! Awesome!!! Entertainment and frustrating in a good way all at the same time!!
0307346617|4.0|Do not get this book and expect anything like the movie. It is a good book - but in a format different from what I'm used to. Basically it is a lot of short stories of the same apocalypse from survivor's perspectives. Its a great read -
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is sooooo much fun and very addicting to play you should get it because it is so awesomely amazing
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book and ending to the hunger games trilogy. Wish it wasn't the end but such is the case. Oh we'll
B008K7RGA2|5.0|This opera is one of my all time favorites and when it is performed by such a brilliant cast along with the detailed set provided by the Royal Opera House I can't resist watching it over and over. A great performance to have saved on dvd.
0393343405|2.0|Greenblatt is brilliant in the earlier chapters where he lays the groundwork on the shift from Medieval to Renaissance. That alone makes the book worth its price. But his primary intent-- to impress upon us the pivotal impact of Lucretius' epic poem on the birth of modernity-- sadly does not deliver. There were no cited moment that it did achieve what he claimed it achieved, other than tangential suppositions. And yet the title elevated the claim even higher--&#34;How The World Became Modern&#34;-- hinting at the possibility that the phenomenon is mapped out in the book. No such content. Granted: One can never really know, of course, the exact alchemy of circumstances that have led to modernity, but the overreaching claim of The Swerve set us up for disappointment. I realize, though, that sometimes, book marketers have to do verbal steroids: who would read a book about a nearly forgotten poem written nearly 3,000 years ago in an ancient tongue, without a bit of a pithy tagline?
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I think people want her to be the same old country pop singer, but because shes trying something new people dont like/understand it. This album is amazing and i 100% get what she trying to do and say. The track &#34;Maybe You're Right&#34; Is bassicly telling you maybe you're right shes craz for wanting to change but this is who she is so deal with it. I love the album and i also love Miley.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This the best game I have ever bought you should totally get this game ..... I love it. It is AWeSoMeness in a game!!!!!!!!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|So well done and well acted. Taken from the stories from a real marine unit, and a few of the actors were the actual marines. Amazing series. Highly recommend.
B000YJ54DU|2.0|In &#34;nothing to Lose, Lee Child attempts to make a social and cultural comment on what he describes as &#34;religious conservatives.&#34; His premise is so contrived and unbelievable it soon becomes obvious that no matter how lacking in reality the story is, he forces through his narrative at the expense of a good story. This one is not worth the time. I suggest you skip this one, as it lacks all the ingredients of most of the other entertaining Jack Reacher novels.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|Excellent anime, Warning very graphic and a bit chest bouncy, not for young viewers. Music is amazing, story surprisingly well written.
B00005YUPO|4.0|Baby Einstein is always great... this was one of my favorites for my kids so I bought this one for a friend.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|Classic movie and music by Queen. Over the top acting and sets. Go Flash Go. A movie that needs to be in your dvd library. Great for date nights or just a rainy night at home for a laugh and fun.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It took me a long time to get around to reading this series (normally I hate Dystopian novels), but now I'm really glad I did!  To read more of my thoughts on this series visit my blog and see the 2 posts about it: [...]  and [...]<br />Thanks!
B00847KFDS|5.0|Very strong set of tunes.  Fogerty keeps the faith with Creedence, but does so in his own way, with other singers.  These versions are strong enough to stand on their own, even when they differ from the originals.  I grew up with Creedence playing but I have no problem with this CD--great versions of great songs.

B00CE03UOC|5.0|I am having so much fun with this! Some of the levels are hard, some are easy. Either way it's fun! I can't wait to get to the higher levels to see what they are like! It's nice to have a game that's good enough that I don't feel like deleting it. I have a Sony S Tablet. No problems, no crashes. Enjoy! BTW  - I have a firewall. Nothing goes online unless I want. No problem playing without going online.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Never, never,give up! It's not over, until it's over!  Grisham  always finds a  way of showing  people are bigger than their faults.
B002VECM4A|1.0|Never di anything about the fact it was a dud. My fault. Where I haven't been able to view it, I can't rate it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Wanted an extra cable to charge my Kindle Fire. This does the trick! Awesome product, great length very happy with it!
B00GH4R95C|3.0|Loved the parts about planet Krypton. The story was okay, acting was mediocre. I usually don't fall asleep during movies, but I slept a little on this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 4 years old daughter really luv it. She like to explore on unexplored route. She even know how to use power up!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|beautifully written and also a page turner.  i savored every word. don't be intimidated by the number of pages, you won't regret devoting the time.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Its a joke. Only supports Google apps, Netflix some others (7 total) but no Amazon. Plus the HDMI connector they give you is basically useless as the device is still stuck behind the TV and WiFi reception is poor.  A Female/Female Coupler would be better.<br />Also some youtube videos do not support Chromecast - not sure why so my playlists end up very short.
B00H1O3Q18|5.0|why Herschel! my heart is broken! First Dale and now my man Herschel! What are they going to do without that wise humble bible believing man! not the mention he's one of if not the smartest man in the whole show. It's going to be hard to move on without him. What a tragedy.
B001TK8TJO|3.0|This book is okay.  It basically re-iterates common sense items.  Don't expect it to repair a failing relationship.  It just gives you an understanding into what someone else's psyche may be about.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Very fun! Just wish the tokens weren't necessary. But besides that, there are so many cool options. Great App! Made very well.
140006922X|5.0|Finally a book that is objective and yet gives a historical account of what life may have been like for Jesus. I loved the rhythm of this book with turns and twists giving full explanations of how, what, why and where.  I devour history and being a Christian it is interesting to me to learn where the teachings have come from.<br /><br />There may be some other Christians who will be vastly offended by what is written.  You will not find in this book a sentence that says “Jesus is the Messiah”. If you are looking for that sort of book I might suggest something written by  Raymond Brown, Chris Mitchell, David Rudolph or Jaroslav Pelikanm. If you can rise above all that you as a devout Christian have learned and read this book like any historical view you will come to love Jesus even more.  This book has given me a better understanding of the horrors, trial, tribulations and atrocities that the people around Jesus endured.  This book provided for me a view into early Palestine life, struggles of the Jewish people and the various Roman factions. Learning about the economics, politics and religious views helped me to better understand Jesus.  Helped to connect the atypical bible stories to what may or may not have occurred based on the limited history. The author has clearly researched all that is available to him.  Beware, you will not necessarily agree or even like some of the views, historical facts and opinions but you will have a better understanding of what Jesus must have gone through. Keep in mind Opinion is part of the entire text. The author is not a historian but a creative writer who is writing a piece of history. This makes the writing exciting and well suited to the average reader.  I like connections to the Old and New Testaments. I believe the goal of the writer was for us to see Jesus as human. And in doing so we learn how truly magical, celestial and spiritual Jesus is.  It is not hard to believe that some 2000 years later we are still discussing Jesus.<br /><br />An excelelnt read and audio version too.
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|After a quick re-read I definitely remember why I loved this book. Absolutely hilarious. It's a little odd reading it now that I have seen the movie so many times, but the situations Becky gets herself into and how she gets out of them are so entertaining. Sometimes you need a light, fun read and this book is the perfect choice.
B00F7AP5T4|5.0|Great cast (Chris Pine is growing on me), great acting, full realization of what a futuristic super soldier should be(!), and incredible special effects - this is the franchise revitalization that was sorely needed.  Bravo, Abrams, bravo.  I can't wait to see more!
B005723JSQ|4.0|This was pretty hilarious. I loved Poppy so much. She was such a fun character, and the things she did to &#34;help&#34; Sam were killing me. Ah, and the footnotes were too much. I can't remember laughing so much while reading a book in a long time. The ending was very sweet, too.
B003E88TKS|4.0|So apparently some people would classify this as a comedy, but I would not. I loved this film and I loved George Clooney's character. A film about a man who makes his living by working for a contract company that is hired to handle layoffs for other companies. He spends more time on the road than he does at home and when he meets someone who appears to be in the same boat, they develop a relationship. Throw in Anna Kendrick and you have me won over. I would even go as far as to say that this is a fairly under-rated movie.<br />I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a 'feel good' movie or a comedy.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This one falls into the &#34;really liked but didn't quite love&#34; category for me. I liked Travis. He was honest about who he was and what he wanted, but he was also quite sweet. It was clear how smitten he was with Abby, and although I felt like she didn't deserve him in the first part of the book, by the end I loved them as a couple. Interestingly I never really saw Travis as that much of a bad boy. Yes, he drank a lot, smoked, and slept around, but somehow I just saw this flawed man with a good heart.<br /><br />I loved Travis' Pigeon/Pidge nickname for Abby. I thought it was cute, and it was a clever little connection McGuire made to Abby's history with poker. Travis was perhaps a little overprotective (borderline stalkerish) at times, but I was able to overlook it since I knew his heart was in the right place. His banter with Abby made me laugh, and I loved his relationships with his father and brothers. Those Thanksgiving scenes were very sweet.<br /><br />The first half of the book I didn't care for Abby at all. It bothered me that she was spending all this time with Travis, including sleeping in his bed every night, but she was also dating another guy. Given her past I understood why she pushed Travis away, but I still found her to be quite selfish. When she finally gave into her feelings for Travis and especially when they went to Vegas, I started to change my opinion of her. She was strong and loyal to her father even though she owed him nothing. I know it was difficult for her to overcome that part of her past and be with Travis, but I'm so glad she did because they were great together.<br /><br />Travis and Abby's relationship was very complicated and messy, but I liked the way it progressed and I was happy with the ending. It was real and honest and even made me teary. I have to add that I loved Shepley and America. They were great secondary characters and I enjoyed what they added to the story. I am looking forward to reading the next book from Travis' perspective.
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|Original. A good ghost story. Not gory at all, just good old fashioned spooky.<br />Might give the younger kids nightmares.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was the first Colleen Hoover book I ever read, and to this day I tear up every single time I think about it. This was an incredibly emotional and poignant story that broke your heart and left me breathless. From the start of the prologue to the very page I was completely engrossed in Sky and Holder's story. It was such an amazing roller coaster ride of emotions, and I never would have guessed such beauty could come out of such pain.<br /><br />I loved Sky and connected with her immediately. She was spirited, intelligent, and funny. Honestly, Sky was the kind of person that I would want to be friends with in real life. I felt like I was right there with her as she was tried to navigate a relationship with Holder, and I had butterflies for her as she started to fall in love with him. Then she had her world turned completely upside down, and I was blown away by how she responded. Her pain was so palpable and heartbreaking, yet she was brave and resilient in the face of it all.<br /><br />Holder definitely came off as abrasive in the beginning of the book, but I warmed up to him very quickly. Even though his personality kept flip-flopping, there was sweetness and sincerity to him that was very endearing. I loved so much about him including his protectiveness and intensity. There was a mysterious part to him that intrigued me, and I found myself continuously wanting to know more and more about him. Somewhere along the way he completely stole my heart right along with Sky's.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can put into words how much my heart hurt for both Sky and Holder as I was reading. This story is very well written, and there were so many twists and turns that I felt like my jaw was permanently stuck on the floor. I really enjoyed the lack of predictability in this book. The love between Sky and Holder was amazing. I could feel the intensity of their feelings radiating off the page, and by the time I reached the end of the book there was absolutely no doubt in mymind that they were destined to be together. Their connection was so profound, and the way they supported each other through everything was beautiful.<br /><br />One thing I love about Colleen's writing is the way she adds little bits of humor to make you laugh and smile in between and sometimes during the heavy moments. I truly appreciated those moments of levity. Hopeless will always have a special place in my heart. Every time I think of Sky and Holder I can't help but smile. This is a book that will take you on an incredible journey, leaving you emotionally drained yet full of hope and happiness.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My sons play this on their iPod Touch and told me it's so much fun that I needed it for my Kindle Fire.  It's a match 3 game with many twists.  Some levels are easy &amp; some can take days even weeks to solve.  You get 5 lives &amp; when you fail a level you lose a life.  Every 30 minutes you earn a life, but 5 lives is the most you can have at once.  So even if you fail miserably and lose your 5 lives,  it's never a long wait til another life is earned.  It's very fun &amp; addicting.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|The beauty of Slammed for me was that it wasn't what I expected at all, and I mean that in the best possible way.  This book was so much more than a love story, although the relationship between Layken and Will is beautiful and powerful.  It's about family, loss, acceptance, and living life to the fullest.  I knew nothing about slam poetry before I read Slammed, and now I am most definitely a fan.  I absolutely loved how it was incorporated into the story, and I have to say the slams that were included in this book are some of my favorite lines in the entire book.<br /><br />Layken was an awesome heroine.  She was intelligent and down-to-earth, and her actions and feelings always seemed realistic to me.  I felt like she was quite mature and level-headed for her age.  Even when her youth showed her reactions seemed justified.  I enjoyed walking in Layken's shoes, and I had butterflies right along with her as she was falling in love with Will.  It was so endearing how much she loved and took care of her brother Kel.  Their relationship was very special.  Kel was a great secondary character with fun little quirks.  Their mother Julia was the one who brought me to tears, though.  She was such a wonderful mother who loved her kids with all of her heart.<br /><br />Oh, Will.  I'm not sure how anyone could not have completely adored him.  Will wasn't that much older than Layken, but he had already made so many sacrifices for his little brother.  He stole my heart with his love for and devotion to Caulder.  Will was such a good person who was forced to grow up so much faster than he should have.  I admired how he put his responsibilities to his brother first even though he deserved and needed Layken in his life.  Their connection was so strong, and it was heartbreaking that they couldn't be together.  I loved Will's passion for slamming and how well he conveyed his thoughts and feelings that way.<br /><br />My heart ached for Layken and Will throughout so much of this book.Not only were they fighting so hard to manage their feelings for each other, but then along came another plot twist that completely broke my heart for them.  The last quarter of the book especially tugged very strongly on my heart strings and made me want to scream at how unfair life can be.  In the end this story was moving and beautiful on so many levels.  Layken, Will and their families will touch your heart and make you want to put the emphasis on life.  Slammed is hands down a must-read book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app/game is amazing and fun it's just like subway surfers. This game works for kindle fire too I had no problems with it. I would recommend it for people who love adventure games because that is what this game is.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My three year old daughter has been playing with this consistently for the past year.  I have a lot of fun drawing with it too.  It has very realistic crayon, marker, colored pencil and paint brush tools with varying widths.  It also has lots of backgrounds and &#34;stickers&#34; that you can use to make your pictures.  I like the ability to save our artwork also.  Except one time it did disappear off my Kindle Fire HD and all our previous art was gone.  Hopefully that won't happen again.  It was almost a year ago and haven't had any problems with it since.  I would highly recommend this app to develop creativity.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|Classic movie, happy to share it with my daughter, and it kept her occupied in the car to and from family gatherings for the holidays.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I just love this show!  After the first episode of season 1 I thought, how can this go anywhere from here?  But much to my surprise and absolute pleasure, this show delivered season after season.  I am so glad I watched this after it was over so that I didn't have to wait a whole week or more between episodes.  I just binged on it every night until I watched them all.  I actually loved the humor in it.  I found my self LOL often.  I'm not sure what that says about me, but I really really just loved this show.  What really sets it apart from other shows I think, is the character development.  The main characters, especially Walt, evolve over the course of the series which really keeps it interesting.
B002FVG5EW|5.0|It is one of my favorite movies by the late great Patrick Swayze! He showed so much depth to the character of VEDA and it made me want to know more about her....Plus, having Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo as co stars is what made it so great. And Stockard Channing, well i loved her in it as well.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This has been very helpful to me.  There are so many sounds to choose from, some that surprise me.  There are several Beach sounds... from gentle lapping lake waves up through the ocean crashing with a fog horn and seagulls in the background, and a couple in between.  There are several choices of rain and thunder storms, camp fires, heartbeat, a cat purring, frogs, crickets, farm sounds, driving sounds, white sound, box fan, AC and many others.  I think it's worth the price, and I'm glad I took the chance.
B000P12LWY|4.0|Great movie.  I like see the history of England, even if some of it is made up.  Rough times if you were on the outs with the King.  Off with your head.
B00FPGV3RS|5.0|I have this on my Kindle HD Fire and have watched it several times.  I got a cable to connect to the HDMI on the TV, so I can see it big screen.  It is great.
0143124404|5.0|I am not a professional sociologist, psychologist, or cultural expert of any kind, nevertheless I thought this book was a great education in how many other cultures work and understanding how our culture arrived to where we are now.  I have read Jared Diamond's previous books.  I consider Guns Germs and Steel a foundation book for anyone wishing to understand human history.  It debunks the notion of superior races and does much to dispel the racism that is still rampant, especially in the United States.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Fun little game.  Not too much story, but because you are limited to one or two special powers at a time there is some replay in trying to find a strategy for each power/combination or powers.
B008JFUR10|5.0|To start I should say that Pacific Rim became an instant favorite movie for me and I knew once I saw it that I would be buying it on blu ray. The product shipped quickly and arrived quickly as well.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|It's ok.  Just like every other Angry birds game, but with &#34;STAR WARS&#34; oooooo.  It's annoying that 5 stell blocks can land on a pigs head without him dying, but thats how the physics engine runs.

B004EBT5CU|3.0|It was what I needed and it suited my purpose. Came on time and in good shape and was able to use it right away.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|A lot of action but storyline has a lot of holes in the plot.  The previous Die Hard Movies were better.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Good game.  Uses your brain cells.  Highly recommend.  I play it on airplanes and it help s to pass the time.
B005ZTFPFQ|2.0|didn't work so well, don't waste your time. Controls are very difficult to maneuver, some games do not translate to the small scereen.
B00B5HQL50|4.0|This movie provides an interesting take on Bond's past and the muck that a covert operation like MI6 can generate over time.
B001KQICHG|5.0|You can't beat the price for this classic Genesis music. Genesis was at their creative best in the early 70's.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|I did not find this book interesting .it did not hold my interest .  It lacked true feelings about how difficult it must be to be in prison
B005COO1X6|5.0|Awesome book! Absolutly loved it!!! I was able to read it on my lunch break. Steven King is one of my favorites for all stories, short or long.
B003DEIRYQ|5.0|This is my favorite Foo Fighters album. If you want to get to know the band then start with this release.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Excellent book that kept you guessing till the end. I would like to see another book in this series. Get to writing!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Great series especially if you follow gritty Congressional affairs or live in the Washington metro area! Kevin Spacey is superb! Polished performances by all......
0763668966|5.0|Gorgeous drawings, nice size, well researched. I wish there was a page for every country but I understand that would be a huge book.
B00AQMQBKK|1.0|It's almost impossible to win, even the easiest challenges. Very difficult, and the dice rolls are completely random, not in your favor!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's challenging in a fun sort of way! My 7 and 9 year old granddaughters got me hooked. It's great to have things in common with them.
B00DEFW998|5.0|The best world music I've heard in years and I'm an ethnomusicologist. Her sister, Norah Jones sings on a few tracks. They are both daughters of the great Ravi Shankar.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Play this every day, no kidding!  My friends and family have been roped into playing also :)
0307744434|5.0|This charming, unique story will enchant you. The story is captivating, and the characters interesting. This is a magical tale that keep you engaged to the end.
1476729085|5.0|If you have ever watched Big Bang Theory and know the character of Sheldon, he reminds me of the character of Don Tilman in this book. At 39, his life is run on clockwork and by routine. But he eventually decides that he needs to share his life with a suitable partner and thus begins the Wife Project. But somewhere along the way he meets Rosie, who has always wondered who her biological dad is. Don, who is a genetics professor, offers to help Rosie by testing potential fathers DNA. What follows is the Rosie Project.<br /><br />As Rosie is completely unsuitable as a partner, Don is able to focus all his time and energy on helping her. The book is funny, uplifting and the characters are so quirky, it is enjoyable to spend the day reading this book and reading about the crazy things they do.<br /><br />I loved the book! Definitely recommend this to readers of all ages. I received a complimentary copy from Goodreads giveaway program.
B007BVOF8E|5.0|Fun to watch, but requires attention and brain power. Good ending and incidentally, pretty true. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of his best - felt as though I was visiting old friends from a Time to Kill. Couldn't put it down - needed to know what was happening next.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|This book was intriguing but not edge of your seat like Grisham had delivered before. The plot seemed like it's deep south setting; just runs at a slower pace. There were many things that could have been condensed. Also, none of the character had much depth.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have never read a more compelling and touching book. Zusak is truly a talent!<br />This book is truly a testament to humanity, innocence,and a Nazi Germany I don't think many of us have ever thought about
006202406X|1.0|A truly terrible way to end an otherwise great trilogy. The ending was weak and unnecessary and leaves you feeling sorry that you started reading the trilogy in the first place.
1401238580|5.0|The mask is the better than I expected at that price. It is easy to see out of, and you'll have no problems breathing. In my opinion, the movie was better than the book, but if you're a fan of the movie, and you want the mask, I recommend this bundle.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|great lesson to be learned from this movie, love any movie with matthew mccon. I don't watch movies but one time, but I could watch this one again.
B002Z0TPFE|5.0|Fun movie good action till u puke. Very predictable but it is what you would expect. I would see it again.
B009HXGD4S|5.0|Delightful and refreshing. A sweet &#34;coming go age&#34; for a boy and a girl in the '60's! Wonderful cast and lots of twists and turns! Not predictable…..Enjoy
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|One of my favorite romances of all time.<br />The deleted scenes are so precious &#60;3 I want more of young Kaleb and Sahara!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This book was a book with lots of details. So read it slowly,so as not to miss any details.. it will guide you through Rome,if you pay attention.  I think anybody who has any interest in myths should read this book.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Of course this is the story of all times. We all need a regular dose of this movie. Recommend it!
B002HML6Y8|5.0|Great movie and even better in blue ray wouldn't mind trying it in 3d in the future as ive upgraded to a new 3d tv
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Great book for getting the big picture of how to build a kindle book. I recommend it for the beginner who is launching a Kindle book.
B00BXHE0CI|5.0|perhaps the best bands of the 90's eccept for nirvana this is the best record and they keep getting better the real I highly recommend it definitely see you them live great band and they also exposed me to other mathcore  like botch Architects and I wrestled a bear once
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote daily....To keep myself organized and to keep all my thoughts in one place. I use it for both my job and home. Don't know what I would do without it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a great book,<br />but the first book( The Hunger Games ) was much much better. Still, I would recommend it
B005P59ANS|5.0|EXCELLENT Case.  Worth every penny.  Fell in a stream with 40 degree water and my i-phone never got wet, damp, or broken.  Case got chipped but Lifeproof replaced it right away.  If I had to purchase again I surely would.  It is worth every penny.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can not believe how many new updates they have I mean they title need one more update then they are good but still a really good game look how many play it
B008JGSM6G|2.0|When it works it is wonderful but I keep having to remove from device and reload to keep it working. I may just give up and forget it.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this for a gift for a friend. I already have the game and love playing it. Success in the game is not just based on the roll of the die but on a winning strategy. Yet maintaining a winning stategy does not require so much concentration that one can't enjoy interacting with friends/famlly while playing.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The original version on my Kindle was great -- all sorts of useful info and easy to use.  The updated version is a major disappointment.  I thought to keep it to amass some of the points awarded, but it doesn't appear to be worth the trouble.<br /><br />I have deleted this app and downloaded a different one.  Very pleased  with the new one.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|Interesting movie. The main character is an intensely focused, disturbed, ill, and hunted man.  The movie was not a fun movie; it was somewhat shocking, and that shock value along with the curiosity concerning what's going to ultimately happen to the main character are what make the movie a fairly engaging watch.
0525478817|5.0|TFIOS was great book! Excellent to read with a loved one, conjured up a holt lot of emotions. Great work John Green!
B002RI9ORI|4.0|It worries me a little that the book confirmed a lot of my suspicions about what was going on.  Perhaps because I've picked up bits and pieces of this critical review from different sources over the years.<br />Even accounting for confirmation bias (can you?), the arguments in this book are very compelling.<br />I've started sharing them with everyone I talk to.<br />So the book changed my thinking and, more importantly, my behaviour.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really liked reading this book.  Even though I was crying my eyes out for the last few chapters.  I wish it had ended differently.  I wish people hadn't given this such horrible reviews just because of the ending.
0446560065|5.0|I haven't looked at the whole book yet, I'm sort of rationing it, like a box of really good chocolates.  I wasn't sure I would like Simon's Cat in comic format since I so enjoy the YouTube videos but this book generates just as many belly laughs as the videos.  I will definitely be buying more of these books.
B000FC1MOQ|2.0|This title accurately depicts many experiences commonly reported by alcoholics and drug addicts. Many situations described in the book are believable, and carry much truth in them. While it is now known that the story was embellished by the author, I believe that the storytelling accurately defines the plight of the addict: dishonesty, people pleasing, resistance to treatment, codependency, and other character defects. I recommend this book to addicts and non addicts alike.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert is, in my opinion, one of the most talented singers in the world.  His voice, his appearance, everything about him is mesmerizing.  This album is excellent, as is his first one.
B000YDAYCW|3.0|A pair of good-looking boots and durable boots, too.<br />But, they are too large.<br />My feet length was 260, usually I take 8.5 of shoes and boots, and just a little bit room.<br />I have 3 pairs of timberland boots, these are too large not like other two.<br />Maybe the 7 or 7.5 was OK for me.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Supernatural is a fantastic show.  I have every season on DVD, and I will never get tired of watching them.
0307730700|2.0|DO NOT TRUST THE BIBLE THUMPING 5 STARS. THIS BOOK IS NOT ABOUT SEALS, ITS NOT ABOUT WAR, ITS NOT EVEN ABOUT THE MILITARY, IT IS ABOUT BIBLE THUMPING RELIGIOUS SALESMEN. Im sure Adam Brown was one of the greatest americans who has ever lived, but he didnt write this book. Some schill trying to press a religious agenda used his ultimate sacrifice as a vehicle to gather more followers to his specific way of belief. This book is trying to sell some chuck norris fairy tale version of &#34;Murica&#34; as authentic by using adam browns heroism as its credibilty. This book is 3/5 religious junk and 2/5 of a general overview of being a seal. Im so glad I torrented this audio book for free instead of wasting my time and money buying it.
B0011NVCSO|2.0|The album is great, however the vinyl warped horribly within six months.  The vinyl was stored indoors, in a temperature controlled setting, along with all my other albums.  I probably played this particular album between 4-5 times.  I've had zero warping on any other album I own.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|The movie was not as funny as I thought it would be. I really liked that I was able to watch the movie with my two kids. So I only give it three stars  because it wasn't all that funny.
B00G21YLF6|5.0|My son and I absolutely loved it. It was fun, exciting, and kept us on our toes the entire time. We have always enjoyed Dr. Who and were very much looking forward to seeing this movie, and it surpassed our expectations. We do not get the channel this show normally airs on, so we are extra thankful that we can watch it and other favorite shows here on Amazon.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I love your new series and read this book five times but I did not feel the connection with it like other books and your a other Percy Jackson series so it lost one star... sorry
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham never fails to entertain me.  I am 80% finished with the book and love it.  I grab my iPad every chance I get to read this latest book.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|We All Love to watch suprermen' I went<br />To a few Stores to buy it on Blu-Ray But<br />Cost to much! So I open my Amazon App<br />And Found it at my Price!! Got it with my<br />Prime in 2, Days. Amazon is Awsome.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Great movie. Funny and action packed. Bruce Willis is still a first rate action hero. Catherine Zeta-Jones is smoking hot.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Anyone Who has seen this Movie! U Know it was very good, But!! To own it<br />On Blu-Ray it's the Best way to Watch it'<br />And if u have Prime! Then you'll have it<br />In 2, Days. Amazon Prime!! Is the Best way to Go.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Deliciously disturbing, couldn't sleep with the lights off.  Every time I heard a bump in the night while reading I got scared!  That being said, this book, while good and creepy, pales in comparison to the Shining.  I feel like Stephen King is a completely different writer than he used to be, and this book feels different.  It was good, but not my favorite.  That might be because the ending fell flat for me, and certain scenes just really left a bad taste in my mouth.  All in all, a good read though, and you'll want to check it out if you like King.
B004SBQALA|5.0|This is one of Those Hard to get Movie!<br />But after going into my Amazon App. I<br />Found it and at a Great Price' and Because I have the Prime account I got<br />It in 2, Days! Prime is the best way to go Because anything u buy!! U get it in 2, Days.
B00DGABUIC|5.0|Super cute, great as something to just sit on your desk if you are a Toothless fan. I got mine from Target last week on sale for $3.99. Regular price was $4.99. I'd suggest shopping elsewhere for a bit unless you want to pay double the retail on here.
1935251740|1.0|2 pages of information. 298 pages of bla bla bla, me me me, my life, my childhood, my personal anecdotes! Such a frustrating book. I choked down the entire thing hoping to get a significant scientific understanding, but it is mostly fluff.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Very extremely close approximation of the PC and XBox game.  Pro - can work on your 'ant farm' at your convenience and pace due the versatility afforded by having access to the game wherever you are.  Con - does not seem to be a 'world map'.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I finally started playing candy crush to help my mom unlock something, and the addictivness of this game is exactly why I hadn't downloaded it! The one thing I don't like is having to wait for more lives or pay for them, other than that it's pretty fun!
B00BSN0K1C|4.0|This is a nice figure. My two year old has to have every superhero he sees and this one is the latest. Looks durable and should last a while as he throws it across the house everyday.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I thought this book was going to be the regular girl meets boy, falls in love, and live happily ever after.  Not true here!  The book was written so well that I believed I was right beside Lou at every moment.  It was as if I was watching everything unfold.  Made me cry tons and relate to some things.  Looking forward to reading another one of her books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best app of minions and despicable me love it it's amazing u should totally get it get it get it get it get it
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|A well written series (although some of the story line is a little ridiculous...I mean, really, aliens?) But one of the very few shows that centers around women who are interesting, strong, and well-rounded if evil, demented and misguided.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|All the way through, not one bad song.  I seldom find a CD that doesn't have a cut I want to fast forward. This was truly the exception. Amazing talent!
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|By far the best glow hockey game out there. Controls are smooth, and the settings are customizable.  The pro version is definitely better than the original, mostly because of the two player mode. Totally worth 99&cent;.
B008J34466|4.0|Great CD, typical Pink music. Delivers what you would expect.  Her personality, diverse, high energy, emotional at times with sensitivity and always soulful.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|If you liked &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; then there's no question you will enjoy Sycamore Row. Same formula, same characters and same setting. Still....it works!
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|This is one of the most amazing series I have ever read. Complex complicated human. Steig Larsson writes in a staccato style that drives some people crazy - I love it I found them easy to read and really engaging and involving. Watch the original Swedish version - the characters are amazing. All the people are flawed but Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace make the main characters really alive.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is a truly great story.  It pulls you end from the start and never let's you go.  Usually I can't stand a book in the first person but this was perfect is of the form.  I read this in the way everyone should read it, in one sitting.  Find a quiet place, a comfortable chair and be immersed.  Usually after I have read a book, it's just another number but this one will be read and read again.  Only Stephen Kings Eyes of the Dragon has pulled me in so far as this story did.  I won't sleep for a while tonight, not from fright, but from reflection.
0060899190|5.0|These are from the postsecret.com website - a sample of the postcards people send. Wonderful inspiring and incredibly engaging. A view of the world from the inside.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my nephew and he absolutely loved it.  The coloring is great, it's a good size, has a nice weight to it (not cheap plastic) and he loved the fact that the mouth opened and closed.<br /><br />TRex even has a long red tongue!
B000SEI618|4.0|While the book was very discriptive, I felt that it didn't grab me and I had to force myself to read it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|love love love love love it...very addicting!!  i actually love this dr. who almost better than others, he charmed me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app. is easy to use.  extremely handy.  I find it to be a wonderful tool for many events be it personal or business.  Go a head check it out.  You will love it too.  Likewise its easy to read.  Enjoy!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The best file manager app for android and more, period. I have it in all my android devices. It rocks!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This is a great story and great acting to bring it to life. Funny in spots and poignant in others.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was AWSOME  I loved it it was amazing I wish I could read it again and again just a good book
0345803493|5.0|I love that this book has brought freedom to the genre!  If you love a good steamy Harlequin &#34;romance&#34; novel the trilogy is about 10 notches above!!!!!!
B00FAI2IUM|3.0|It's okay, nothing spectacular as compared to other racing games I have played, seems like they are always bugging you to buy upgrades.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Can you say scary!  I love dramas that you could see happening in today's &#34;America&#34;!  If you like any end time movie, this one makes the top of the list!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|If they don not follow up with this one it will be a miracle. The action is great the idea of super villains and the tie in conversations with other movies is great.
B000HL09MG|5.0|Sensual and adventurous flick!  Cruise and Kidman chemistry is HOT!  Steamy drama for adults only, put the kids to bed and put some spice on!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|A movie you should not miss. Takes a long premise of obtaining what is right through the awe and ooohs of magic.
B00G32OER4|5.0|The story line is a little similar to that of Amityville Horror but is most definitely edge of your seat material!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Watched it twice and had to buy it. The last movie left a parallel universe with the possibility of changes. Kind of like saying the time line is now changed. This movie plays on that and makes a great remake.
1490313370|5.0|Finally a book that gets you thinking and on the road to get you out of your rut.  He simply tells it like it is. Also, started to follow his blog. You do not &#34;NEED&#34; to be anything more than what you are to get going, he has a way of making you feel unique and to show you in your field of interests how to go get more info to make you a shiny star......but you have to go after it.  Love the way he makes you realize that it is simply o.k. if you have screwed up or failed in life, it is o.k. For those of us that have been going round and round as I have in the self help, law of attraction reads, this will then be the book that puts almost an end to that, he has a way of getting you to &#34;snap out it&#34; and Choose Yourself.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It is realy cool...but the only thing is if you dont buy it with money it only lets you have 3 alarms, and im a busy girl i need to have lots of alrms . But other than that its fine a little boring and the sounds are so bad but ya its fine for a person whos not that picky :) :(  ;)  : $  :/
B009YP9L7U|4.0|While the story is predictable, it was still a fun mindless read.  A couple steamy parts that were rather well written and steered clear of being crass.
B00942Y35S|5.0|Great story with an excellent lesson about self-esteem and self love for all children, especially girls.  It even helped me!
B0044XV3R8|3.0|Even though it is subtle, there are a number of places (roughly 7) where the video has jumps in it.  These jumps are very small but they are noticeable. To me it detracts from the viewing experience and I'm surprised that a professional production house allowed it to go out this way.<br /><br />That being said, Avatar is still an epic story with epic imagery.  I just expected the video to be totally smooth...is that too much to expect?
B009S33I68|4.0|I bought this ebook after watching the movie (Mel Gibson) that was based on it. It can be a bit plodding at times, but, overall, it gives you a good idea of what combat is like. These men wouldn't call themselves heroes, but their acts definitely were heroic.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Although I am not proficient with word,I look forward to using this program  Hope to use it for a long time..
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|Enjoyed by my Grandson and my wife. Had a hard time using my Kindle Fire since they dominated the device.
B0016YBFZ8|1.0|I don't like to write reviews - good or bad, but this purchase needed it.  First of all the DVD is not the best quality.  Second, I wasn't aware the DVD had subtitles, that's very distracting.  The case is stamped &#34;Made in Mexico&#34; is that why?  Will not purchase another DVD online again.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Candy and video games- a perfect combination for your sugar rush. Bad guys being good guys and bad guys, a pretty sophisticated plot, so definitely for the older kids.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|This is a great cd, but you would not expect anything but good from this group. I have been listening to them for years and never heard a tune I did not like by them.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|New School Star Trek: heavy on the action, light on the intellectual.<br /><br />I guess if I didn't grow up watching ToS, TNG, Ds9 and Enterprise; I'd LOVE it.  Granted it is an alternate timeline, per the first movie's script/plot, but still it lacks that certain something that hints to Roddenbury's original ideas.<br /><br />Decent, popcorn action-flick. Star Trek, but barely so IMO.<br /><br />Honestly if the special effects were used in conjunction with a &#34;traditional&#34; Star Trek script, I'd love this re-imagining.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love this movie and all went well with my order...very simple  Will order again in the future for sure I will
B003VWU2WA|2.0|I bought a few of these as part of a recommendation for a photo booth software I use. They are clearly not meant to be used a lot. The tension of the button falters after a while. You have to push it a few times to get it to work.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Amazing book. Loved it. I couldn't put it down the whole time. The more I read the more interested I was.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|Unrealistic that a pilot so under the influence of alcohol and drugs could perform at such a high level.  Leads users to think they are not impaired.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Excellent storytelling from Grisham, but it bogged down in details a couple of times.  I'd recommend it to all Grisham fans.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|it is the finest film making (best on television in my opinion) and storytelling of this show to date, and never truer to itself and its commitment to realism.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Love this game but it always freezes my kindle after a few games! Played it frequently when I first got it, now only occasionally.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I have read other Pulitzer Prize winners that seemed to deserve it.  This one did not.  At points it was confusing...and the author seemed to be out of options so far fetched solutions were added.  Did not think it was that great, but an interesting read.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I was able to catch this game when it was a free app of the day, so I would say this game is really fun, but wouldn't be worth the $2.99 price tag. It was quite short, and had a few crashes. The game is easily beat within a few hours of play, maybe a bit more if you have a hard time spotting some of the really small, well-hidden items and refuse to use hints. The spelling of a few item names are off, but not a terrible amount. It would also gets a bit laggy when you select items in rapid succession. One thing that bugs me is using the pinch-to-zoom. There is no helping a penalty click for trying to use the function. Every touch to the screen is either a successful click or a wrong one regardless of whether you are trying to zoom or need to cast your light to try and find items in a darkened stage. Expect to get plenty of -20 second penalties for those stages. Won't completely drain your time, but depletes it unfairly.  Still, it is a pretty neat game. Has some fun, low-stress puzzles. The music is well done. Overall, a good game to pass the time. :)
B004A7OQKY|2.0|this is a decent work out, but this lady is a little weird and it looks like a home movie she made in her living room.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Such wonderful imagination! I didn't realize this was the same author who wrote Coraline, which my children and I loved, until after I'd purchased it. I don't know what made me look up the author before I read it, but I'm glad I did. I think it helped me to know it was by the same author. I knew that it would be fanciful, extravagant, nonsensical at times, and a bit dark. It was all that in the best way! I loved it from beginning to end.
193700788X|1.0|she obviously should have ended up with Eric :p who wants to date a guy who turns into a dog? blech. dumb book. But I enjoyed the rest of the series
B005GSVFAK|5.0|Toy Story 3 is the best in the trilogy. My wife cries every time we watch it. Our exchange student loved it as well. One of the best movies to watch in 3D.
1592402690|5.0|When I first saw the movie \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" if felt as if I was in 16th century England watching the very first performance of Romeo and Juliet. This book gave me the same feeling of eavesdropping on my favorite band's development as musical artists. Very interesting material to work with, giving insights not available elsewhere.  While I was most interested in the accounts of The Beatles in terms of both their personalities and their music, it was good to hear more about the engineering that goes into their later albums and how important the role of the sound engineer is to a final production. Its a lot more than putting some microphones in front of three guitars and a set of drums! It also provides a lot of clues to what to listen for on their best albums, who wrote which songs, why albums got the names they did, some of their friends and associates, etc. A lot of funny lines throughout.  Wonderful to read of the group's early camaraderie, sad to see it unravel. A good history of the sonic development of the greatest popular band of all time.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This was the best Batman in the trilogy. I was a little disappointed in the 2nd but this made up for it. A good way to finalize this set of Batman movies.
B000IOM1YQ|2.0|Let me start by saying that I love the music of Alan Parsons Project. Having said that, I have to say, that I think that Stereotomy is the weakest Alan Parsons album. None of the songs are particularly memorable, and the album lacks that big Alan Parsons sound.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|One of the best musicals yet. I have listened to it several times and continue to enjoy the great music.
B00003CXDV|5.0|One of my favorite movies. A hilarious comedy that pokes fun at the science fiction genre, especially the entire Star Trek phenomenon. Tim Allen is great as the commander.
1567184855|5.0|Great reading. This and companion book Destiny of Souls should be read by anyone that is searching for an understanding of our life cycle.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Portnoy is one of the best percussionists out there.  Richie's voice is awesome and Billy is burning up the bass.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|tons and tons of levels. unique and addictive and playing with face book makes it competitive with friends. you just cant quit playing but be warned you will get stuck but friends can help out with extea lives
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Less action than the first two but still as intriguing! Absolutely loved this series and everything about it including plot, characters, and setting!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Wow, I had no idea that my love of bread was causing a brain fog. I implemented his suggestions and techniques and feel a difference already. Thank you Dr Perlmutter!
0525478817|5.0|I read this about a year ago, and I have read it around 5 times since.  It is an amazing book, and Holt McDougal has become one of my favorite authors!  I haven't purchased my copy yet, because I'm holding out for an autographed copy.  I patiently await the Holt McDougal squiggle!  One day I will have one, whether I purchase it or meet him face-to-face.  Fingers crossed for the latter.  ;)
B001EC0OMM|5.0|I love old movies and Hepburn is one of my all time favorites.  I wish for more K. Hepburn for viewing.  Thanks
B00F9040HU|5.0|Excellent game keeps you going until you complete each level &bull;&bull;&bull; I like that the start off is Greece and moves on to other adventures &bull;&bull;&bull; definitely will recommend. Looking forward to the next level :) Not difficult just keeps you interested in creating whatever is required in order to move on :)
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The best series I have seen since Dallas in the 1980's!  Can't wait for season 4 to begin.  I am addicted!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Excellent direction in the story. Great actors. Good villain. This is a great reboot to a great franchise. Can't wait for the Batman/ Superman movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. Amazing book. So much detail in the words, like you can actually see the things in your mind when described.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|A Unique take of a X-men movie, re-inventing history. Fassbender and McAvoy as Magneto and Xavier are great and they are the best part of the movie. Mystique and Shaw are interesting also. The rest aren't that special but it doesn't matter. Still a great movie.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Ok.. The ending. Ugh. Oliver left so much unresolved! The ending felt rushed to me- like she just needed to end it. I personally enjoyed the love triangle factor, but Julian and Lena barely spoke to one another... he was just kinda..there. Why write a love triangle if she's not going to truly involve the 3 characters. AND RAVEN. Ok. I'm fine with her ending- but it was so unjustified. Like Oliver made her die at last minute- like a quick idea..<br />With Hana. I loved the unexpected stuff within her story. But what happens at the end? Where does she go? Does Fred live?<br />Personally the story wasn't as great as the first 2. If Oliver is going to leave so much unresolved, then a 4th book should be placed.It doesn't even have to be long- 60 pages would give justice to the ending.<br />There needs MORE!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicted!!! I can't put this game down. Love getting the new levels and really love the new spin feature. Keep it coming!
B000VWSINI|4.0|old album is one of my favorites.  Lost old CD and love that i don't have to worry about that ever again since it is all on Amazon music now.
B008602KQI|5.0|Greatest Movie Ever!
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|Bought this album for the one song (Royals) but found that the album as a whole is pretty good.  Not sure i will be a diehard fan but this is a good album.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|The story remains the same but the details and special effects are nice. I enjoyed this version of the story.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|For a free application this is a steal. To make this a go you must actually do them! Enjoy the variety and keep up the work it will be worth all the effort.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Wow, what a great movie! I wanted a copy for my collection. It got here very fast, so now I can see it at my pleasure! Thanks for the great customer service too!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|In some ways, I found the novel interesting.  I thought the insights into another culture were informative.  But, I really did not find any insights into life that were unique or even appealing.  I could see the heartbreak at a little girl being sold. A horror !  How could people be so cruel.  And, actually, that may have been the message.<br /><br /> I did not like the way everything was tied up nicely with a bow.....life is not like that.  Getting used to disappointments would have been closer to the way things happen.  I enjoyed his other books more.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|I have not seen this one yet, it's a gift for my hubby! It will appear with Santa's gifts under our tree! Thanks for saving me money and giving me a great gift ! It got here super fast too!
B002MFULQO|5.0|Great movie and great cast<br />must see movie<br />Part of the American history, makes you think<br />Kevin Costner is amazing
B008JFUO36|5.0|Santa is bring this one home! Thanks for the rapid shipping, Santa tells me it is wrapped and ready for the big night! Thanks for the elf help guys!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I had to read this book to find out why it received a Pulitzer Prize award. I am not partial to fiction but this is a great read.  I will recommend it to my literary friends.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|Wanted my own copy of this one, I love Wolverine and cannot wait to get his new one! Thanks for shipping it so fast, Santa has this one wrapped for the tree !
B000O599ZS|5.0|This story filmed in Monument Valley is another fine example of John Ford and John Wayne working together. Each new their role in the production was of utmost importance and delivered some of their best material. The stark beauty of this everlasting red rock country combine with the primitive sometimes hopelessness of the situation to deliver on of the best performances ever made by John Wayne. No one knew better how to apply Wayne's talents to an old frontier story than John ford and it is done to perfection here. The Searchers is a must have DVD of the old west with John Wayne as the star. If you have never seen it you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
034544678X|5.0|Great book to help with understanding dog behavior. I am able to pick out when my dog is uncomfortable and what makes her happy
B00DONMGH0|2.0|Cute doll but the description is a bit misleading. The size is in cm and not inches so it is much smaller than expected but I wasn't' carful enough in reading. Expensive for the size.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite storytellers.<br />In &#34;Sycamore Row&#34; I quickly get drawn into the story and can't wait to get back to it. The characters are true to life. Even though I'm not in the legal profession, I easily can follow the proceedings and court maneuvers and learned a few new things about probate and wills. The small town venue reminds me of the place I grew up, everyone knows something and rumors spread quickly through local restaurants and stores. I especially liked the sensitive approach to racial issues and the resolve that ends the story. It suggests a glimmer of hope.
0553386794|5.0|1) fast shipping<br />2) perfect condition<br /><br />3) Excellent story line as thick and colorful as a soap opera. I started reading Game of Thrones after I saw the HBO series and fell in love with the dynamic characters.  Martin's female characters are all strong and sometimes cruel and wicked.  It's not very often fantasy novels (or any novel for that matter) has a wide array of strong, female leads.<br /><br />If you are coming to this book after seeing the series like I did, know that it follows season 1 of the Game of Thrones exactly.  Or I should say HBO follows Martin's first novel in the series exactly - practically word for word, scene for scene.  This has a dual effect. a) the book seems boring as there are no surprises after watching the TV show, however,  b) as a fan, it's wonderful to see Hollywood (or HBO in this case) to honor a book for the masterpiece that it is and to not glamorize or bastardize it.  Any fan of the book would be excited to see the small screen bring their characters to life in such. Isn't that one of the biggest complaints readers have?  We get excited to see how  are heroes on the page are brought to life, but are usually disappointed - at least I am  (examples: X-men, World War z, etc.)<br /><br />So, if you are picking up the book after seeing the series, there will be no surprises. (though apparently Martin cannot find another simile for red other than blood nor can he not mention &#34;winter is coming&#34; for longer than 20 pages. Sigh.  give it a break, Martin! I heard you the first hundred times)<br /><br />If you are reading this book without having been acquainted to the TV series then be prepared for hundreds of characters, fast moving plot lines, witty characters, megalomania, and political corruption and deception. The plot never stagnates.
1451666179|1.0|It might be a wonderful book to read but I can't get past the use of the word \\"f...\\" in the first few pages. Sadly, our culture continues to be debased by the printing of books  by authors who believe they need to use vulgar language. You do not need to use vulgar language to make a point unless you have no point to make at all which appears to be this author's modus operandi.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great Buy!!! All the Harry Potter movies in one solid collection. I enjoy its small design for having so many discs. A Must buy for Potter fans.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I have bought and read all the Scarpetta books in the series.  I will not buy any more.  If I read them I will wait for library copies.  I am upset that I pre-ordered this one.  I did not like that Ms. Cornwell placed Kay in Newtown, CT at all.  That entire opening of the book felt like it was added after the rough draft was written.  It did not feel like it flowed with the story and I believe it could have been omitted.  Spoiler alert --- I did not like that more than 1/2 through the book a character's name is introduced out of the blue.  I literally said &#34;that's who they are looking for&#34; out loud. Very disappointing.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Just a great CD.  As a long time fan, it's really great to see these guys still going strong.  By far, their best work.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|This is a very sobering, thought-provoking film.  I wasn't expecting quite the heavy psychological drama, but it was well- and thoughtfully acted.  Just quite depressing subject matter.  It's one of those films where I can say I'm glad I saw it once, but don't think I'd ever choose to watch it a second time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books really are attention getters and very trashy but captures your mind very easily.  I don't know who I would recommend these books to.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|i still give both new star treks 5 stars regardless of the plot issues, they are great movies. i totally agree with die hard trekkies that abrams essentially ruined the franchise by violating the prime directive, and inflating kirks ego far out of proportioin. that being said, the movies are spectacular, and for any sci fi fan (i am not a die hard trekkie), they are execellent additions into any scifi heads library

B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I had forgotten how much fun freecell is!  Classically neat and clean, great graphics, smooth actions, pick out any picture in your gallery for a background (snowy cabin) or a color and off you go.  Easy to redo a move or replay....I'm hooked on free cell again.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Intense storyline and great performances, especially by Charlie Hunnam.  He is not only easy on the eye, but very convincing as Jackson Teller.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, I know what all the fuss is about. This game is fun! It makes the time sitting in an airport go quicker.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Best book I've read in years! A book our entire book club LOVED! The relationships and social issues of their day were very similar to ours today. Circumstances may change, but relationships and family struggles are constants. I read this in 2 sittings.
B00G32OER4|4.0|A cute horror story. More gore than just a ghost story. I wouldn't say I ever felt genuinely scared but I didn't feel bored and was able to stay engaged in the story without feeling it was overly corny. It was worth renting.

B007SGM084|5.0|These books are so much more than a sex book that you hear people talk about! The story line is beautiful. Two people trying to find their way into a relationship and falling in love while dealing with their demons... and don't we ALL have some demons?
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|It was just in time. it is brand new, and my husband will love it=)BTW!the price it is very good.Totally good review.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Beautifully written and paced! I am now a confirmed fan of Ms. Setterfield. This story weaves around the history of a family, a very dysfunctional family. It's been many weeks since I've read this book, but I still think of Margaret.<br /><br />If you love a book with a gothic feel and written in a timeless fashion, you will love this story.
B0046A9MRW|4.0|One of Agatha Christie's best murder mysteries- keeps you guessing right until the end. Hercule Poirot, as usual, is impeccable.
B004Q3UL56|2.0|This movie was way too long.  Good story line but not convincing.  Trite.  Too much Pfizer. Good actors wasted on bad writing.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|Gameloft has done it again. Arguably the best there is at writing free game apps. And definitely the best at making players want to spend a few bucks to get the best weapons and equipment. Great job guys....again.
030758836X|4.0|I hate to admit that I liked this complicated, screwed up story. The book isn't screwed up. It's very well done, and that's what I ended up liking. There are no characters to like here, a cheating husband and a brilliant, crazy wife, Their plots are elaborate but believable, although I believe the police would have been far more involved in bringing charges against both these nutty people.<br /><br />Everyone loves a lovable nut. Everyone feels for a well-drawn person with a mental illness. But these folks are discreetly crazy and amazingly revenge seeking. It's hard to say more without spoiling so I won't.<br /><br />I read it in no time in spite of myself. Worth reading. I think most will be reluctant fans. I'll be watching for the next Flynn, and I suppose I'll read it whatever the subject might be. In my opinion Flynn is that good a writer!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Works good. But I have trouble with some levels. You can ask for help with Facebook if you struggle. It's a great game.
1476727651|4.0|I wasn't a _Shining_ fan, so I didn't expect much here. Yet Stephen King has changed a lot recently with his last two books especially. I decided this recent history required that I give this book a chance. I'm glad I did!<br /><br />This is the story of the grown up Danny, the kid with the shining from King's third book. He's now a drunk whose trying to reform as he lives alone at a hospice in New England. He's a janitor by trade, but his true work is to stay with residents as they die and help them move across into an undescribed after-life.<br /><br />Danny &#34;meets&#34; Abra, as a very young girl. For years, they meet psychically through dreams and writing which suddenly appears on the black board in Danny's room. Later, he enlists the help of her father and few friends in an attempt to protect her from the True Knot, a group of eternals who want to feed on her psychic ability, an action that would result in Abra's death.<br /><br />Okay, it turns into a typical King, too long, sometimes over the top. But this is a much more mature King than the man who wrote _The Shining_. This book is scarier. The characters are a bit better. It's a much better book.<br /><br />There's a lot of AA stuff in here as Danny fights to get his life back. It gets a little old, but it has its place in the scheme of the book.<br /><br />I recommend it for general fiction readers, as well as for followers of King and readers who enjoy the horror genre.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|excellent plot, excellent performance, and excellent song, greater than all bond movie I've ever seen, director sam mendes is gifted.
1451666179|5.0|The majority of negative reviews seem to come from these camps:<br /><br />1. There's not enough all-new, previously unpublished content<br />2. The new content that is there isn't as funny as the original blog<br />3. I don't like the graphic novel-ish format and prefer reading online<br />4. The book contains too many F-bombs for my taste<br /><br />... to which I counter:<br /><br />If you are already a fan of Allie's previous work, support her by buying her book. Regardless of the ratio of new vs republished work, by investing in the book, you can forever own a piece of Allie's work and hold it in your hands, and share it with others in the physical world in a more permanent and tangible way than pushing a button to just send them yet another link. Not to mention that it's the right thing to do. Invest a little coin to support a struggling artist who has been brave enough to bare her soul and gracious enough to previously share her work for free. By buying her book, you send the author a vote of confidence and tell her that her work has value.<br /><br />If you are not already familiar with Allie's work, read the &#34;Best of&#34; section of the Hyperbole and a Half blog first. Then understand that since that blog was written, the author has been openly struggling with debilitating depression and her new work comes from a much darker place. Given that, the raw language and journey into the abyss in her newer pieces may not be your cup of tea. And that's okay. Simply move along, then, nothing more to see here.
B0029VUV70|5.0|it tells us a post-war story in unique way, with psychological depth.<br />movie intertwines two lines together, one is odd sexual relationship between two protagonists, another is the influence of WWII to post-war born generation, which catch up the attention of audience.
B006TTC54A|5.0|This is one of my top ten favorite movies.  From tossing out the cigarette lighter to the Brother's last concert gig.  Classic!
B0041T52S6|1.0|Ok if you are a fan of immoral trash then I hope you change because this movie is garbage. There is nothing decent in this film I would not watch it on a date or with my family. Kids and teenagers should be better protected.<br />Get rid of trash like this
1594202273|5.0|An incredible amount of research resulted in an integrated description of not only the local and tactical events with living personalities surrounding the ONE incident but having this vivid detail delivered within the strategic situation and national policy that evolved from the need to end WWII to the accurate bickering among the &#34;winners&#34; and their children over the global mission of the United States.  Between the &#34;leaking&#34; of data by pouting princes who felt &#34;they&#34; were not being appreciated to the outright treason of those who just fed the data to foreign spies the reader is better prepared to understand the cancer that is killing the American Republic.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|Violent, but excellent series. This series is not for the weak hearted. Season 1 should be seen before viewing Season 2.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|hootie, aka darius rucker, retains the magic he had with hootie and the blowfish. i am awaiting another great cd from him.
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|It was a good book but not great.  I did finish it but decided to look for another series before starting book 2.  There is good detail but a lack of connection to the characters.  You do get to know them, but it takes most of the book to do so.  There just seems to be a lack of connection to them emotionally.  I do like the the originality of the book though.  There are some new ideas about how the world this book takes place in works that are original and the book did have some plot twist I didn't see coming.  Another good thing is that not all the bad guys die while all the good guys win and get married with lots of babies in a huge castle.
B0000028WD|5.0|i saw part of the concert on PBS and loved it, especially the jam session of all along the watch tower. well shot so you really get a feel for the artists and the concert. wish i had been able to get tickets. watching the 'greats' perform, whether i really like them or not, is fabulous.

B000TEPIQS|3.0|I bought the album for &#34;Breathe&#34;. The rest of the songs are nice but not exceptional. I'm happy I have it.
B00C4U9U4Q|3.0|Charli XCX is like listening to someone who just took a bunch of E and wrote pop music. They're not great. Kind of party tunes, but even a little too boring for a party. I like some of them, but half the album is not worth listening to. &#34;Nuclear Seasons&#34; is the best track and if you're only getting one, that's the top pick.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Like another reviewer said, everything you need without stuff you don't.  Easy clean interface.  It did hang-up and lag sometimes on my Kyocera Hydro - could be the Hydro.  Controls are straight forward.  Game is very fun and you win most of time!
B00GLQQ07E|5.0|WOW! The music in this movie is seriously so good. I love how the music ties together the story instead of just being a random aside in the movie. It's so good and it makes me want to go see the movie AGAIN! Only problem here is mixing Idina Menzel's voice with Kristen Bell's. While Kristen is a good singer, she does not have the strength of Idina's. But it's still a fun soundtrack and Let It Go is one of the most AMAZING Disney songs I've heard since Princess and the Frog (that's coming from someone who LOVES Tangled).
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Wow... This book was not what i expected it to be. I was VERY disappointed with it!! I thought Veronica Roth respected us more than this!
B008EEB4TA|5.0|Marina Diamandis is a lyrical genius. This album is sarcastic, dry, and witty. It's easy to relate to and makes you reflect on how tragic and shallow pop culture can be. Wonderful! This album is much more mainstream than The Family Jewels, but I love it! I wish it were more popular!L
B004LROUNG|5.0|I love how the story moves along quickly and keeps you hanging on! I couldn't help but picture Marshall from &#34;how I met your mother&#34; as the main character.
1608871088|5.0|Rise of the Guardians was one of the most beautiful works of animation I have ever seen. This book is pretty good, there's a lot of information on how they planned and executed the film, but I wish there was more character development sketches. I think Jack Frost only got a total of 3 pages and half of each was filled with words!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Way better than I expected. I like a good futuristic story like 1984 or Brave New World and this movie was right up there.

Wish there were MORE pictures!!! I would also love magical pages that popped up for every new Disney movie. Unfortunately, I don't think Elsa and Anna will just pop into the back of the book. Haha
B0091THRCU|5.0|I didn't want to permanently cover up my new gold iPhone 5s with a hard-to-remove case, so I gave this particular case a try after seeing on-line and so far, it's working out just fine.  The elastic strap that helps extract the iPhone from the case had me a little skeptical at first, but turns out it works great.  I mostly use my iPhone indoors at a desk or in my car, so I don't need a great deal of protection, so this case is perfect for my specific needs.  If your needs are similar to mine (protecting the phone in my pocket or that occasional unfortunate &#34;drop&#34; when carrying around in your hand, this case is a solid option.  Plus, its looks are pretty stylish as well.
B009VLXMJA|3.0|I like half the songs on this album. It's pretty Taylor Swift-y in that most of the songs are about romance in some way or another. This one is more pop rock than anything (why is she still invited to the CMA's???). Don't think it's worth all the awards she's gotten for it, but it's alright. A few of the songs are really amazing, then the other ones are just meh.

1416955070|5.0|WARNING: This review may contain (very small) spoilers. (true rating: 4.5)<br /><br />First of all, great cover. Second, it was about time I got into this series. I avoided all the hype when the books first came out and started to become popular, but when the movie came out, I felt it was finally time I look into what the hype was all about. The first thing I did was watch the movie, which was pretty good – if a little all-over-the-place at times. Having enjoyed it, I jumped right into the first book, and without delay, subsequently finished all five.<br /><br />Honestly, overall, and I’ll probably repeat this when I review the other four—I enjoyed the novel series a lot more than the movie. It, (like most book series), felt more complete and put-together. The plot made more sense, and there were a lot of little moments (like Simon being turned into a Rat) that didn’t make the cut into the movie, but seemed to suit the books just fine.<br /><br />Like most YA novels, it had it’s moments of unnecessary drama (that’s just how teenagers are), but overall the writing was clear, concise, and fast-paced. I never found myself shaking my head at the narrative or skimming bits. I didn’t feel the need to throw things at the characters (okay, maybe at Simon), and although Clary sometimes did really stupid, dangerous things, I didn’t get annoyed at her character like I do with some YA heroine’s.<br /><br />I think overall, if you liked the movie even remotely, you should give this book (and the entire series) a chance. The characters were a lot more personable in the book vs. the movie, and their motives, a little easier to understand. Jace especially was easier to connect to in this version of the story, though I think Clary possibly lost a bit of her coolness-factor. Simon still irritates me, but no surprise there. Anyways, it was a good book and I’d recommend it to any YA (or even adult) reader. The entire series is age appropriate for anyone 13+. A little later in the series (towards the last two books) there are some racier bits if you’re considering gifting this series to your teen, but the author was very careful not to go into great detail of any sexual/romantic encounter even that late in the series, and I’d certainly feel comfortable recommending it to anyone 13+ who enjoys paranormal fantasy. The world-building was a nice mix of fantasy/paranormal that leaned a bit towards the grittier side, with conniving not-so-nice fairies, vampires, werewolves, demons, and avenging angels.<br /><br />The –only- reason this book got a 4.5 rating from me rather than a full 5 stars, was because a little later in the series (the last two books in particular) the story gets even better. This wasn’t my favorite book in the series, but it was still a good read. Take a chance, pick up a copy today. This one’s going on my keeper shelf.e later in the series (towards the last two books) there are some racier bits if you’re considering gifting this series to your teen, but the author was very careful not to go into great detail of any sexual/romantic encounter even that late in the series, and I’d certainly feel comfortable recommending it to anyone 13+ who enjoys paranormal fantasy.

B006N9XHLQ|5.0|Wow, I have a new favorite author! This was a great series well thought out and full of great twists of plot. You don't figure these out on page two, and it has three dimensional characters who just happen to be gay. I'm so glad he's written a lot of other books but please continue this series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is an excellent series.  The writing is gifted and always an unexpected turn takes place.  The cast of characters keeps the story vibrant and interesting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a great book! It has left my anxious to start the final book! I'd recommend this book to everyone!
0486275590|2.0|This really isn't the most impressive of classics. The pacing is slow, the plot isn't really thick in action, and the ending is predictable. The redeeming qualities of this story might be the characters and setting, however. The relationship between Silver and Jim was quite unique and curious. But over all, I wouldn't waste time with this book. It isn't engaging enough. Would I read more by this author? Not likely. Would I recommend this book to others? Nope.<br /><br />See the full review on my website, Awesome Book Assessment:<br />[...]
B00881VLCE|1.0|Worked fine until a new update. Lost  the puzzles.I had paid for and now New one I purchase d won't.download.
0399255370|4.0|I was hesitant to buy this after some of the negative reviews but went for it anyway. I like this book.  It's creative and fun.  It does contain whining but I think if the reader delivers the message in an upbeat way, it's not so bad.  I think it's a cute story.  I wouldn't recommend buying it for a new reader as all of the text is written by the crayons themselves and the lettering would be difficult for a new reader to decipher.  If you are looking for a book that teaches a profound life lesson, this is probably not the one for you. But reading this aloud in fun voices provides for a light, fun story.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is one of my most played games on Android. Game is fun, interesting, engaging, and definitely kept my interest long past where I get bored with most other mobile games. I've completed all upgrades and am almost to 10000000 points. Not sure what happens when I get there but I'm hoping for something reasonably satisfying to cap a really enjoyable game. Thanks EightyEight Games, well done.
B005COO1X6|3.0|A little underwhelming.  I was expecting a bit more considering the reviews.  Also $2.99 is a pretty steep price for an 80 page book, even one by Stephen King.  I think he is a great writer but for that price, I wanted a heck of a lot more than I got.  The story itself was good but the ending seemed a bit too simple.  How could that really be all it took to stop the villian?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Went to dinner the other night with a few girls from the office and found out I'm not the only one addicted :) lots of fun to play.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|I like Ryan Reynolds so I figured I'd give this a shot.  It wasn't that great.  Reynolds' character was okay, I didn't much like Jeff Bridges' character.  That cowboy accent of his drove me crazy.  There are a few good laughs in it.  Rent it if you really like Reynolds, I don't recommend buying it.  I don't think anyone needs to see this twice.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Excellent story line and cast. characters are realistic for the period and the costumes and landscape are beautiful. Very realistic.
0439023513|1.0|This would've appalled me if I'd been really into the world and characters, but fortunately, the first and second books weren't good or immersive enough for me to care, so instead I just sat back and marveled at how rushed and thoughtless Suzanne Collins managed to make this conclusion to her popular Hunger Games trilogy. This story reads like it was never outlined and meanders along until it reaches an unsatisfying, meaningless conclusion.<br /><br />Let's face it, the style of these novels has always been high on the melodrama: &#34;Do I really love Peeta? I can't tell. Maybe I love Gale.&#34; This sort of interpersonal drama has been a strangely heavy focus throughout the series, considering the world these characters live in. When you're fighting tooth and nail for survival, is whether a kiss was &#34;real&#34; or not that important? According to Suzanne Collins, this is very relevant to the revolution against the Capital. In fact, Katniss' emotional struggle over which boy she likes best takes precedence over the revolution. The love triangle reaches insufferable levels of sickening and we need to sit through paragraphs of Katniss' internal whiny monologues over which man is right for her. Um... you guys know there's a war happening right? Meanwhile, Primrose Everdeen, the kind-hearted sister Katniss nobly volunteered to save in the first book, is relegated to a cardboard character who's only function is to (SPOILER) die and provide a &#34;darkest moment&#34; for the protagonist, setting up a predictable but hokey climax.<br /><br />Another problem is a lack of character arcs for pretty much everyone, most noticeably the protagonist. Rather than creating an opposition to the Capital that readers can root for and support, Collins opts for the morally grey/black revolutionaries who are just as bad, if not worse. Katniss was once a pawn of the Capital and is now a pawn of the resistance, simply because she was instrumental in inspiring people to rebel. So much fora transformative journey for our hero. This plays out more like a girl's descent into madness as she realizes how helpless she is to control her own destiny. Was that really what Collins was going for? With all the lovey sappiness of this series, I find that hard to believe. Katniss does eventually take matters into her own hands but there is no purpose behind it aside from simple revenge. The one notable choice Katniss makes in the story (hmmm, which bad guy do I shoot?) is hardly character defining.<br /><br />As if the story structure weren't bad enough, the book is just dull and difficult to get through. New characters we don't have time to care about are introduced and brutally killed off before we can get to know them. The status of the &#34;war&#34; is unclear and confusing. The Capital seems a weak and pathetic adversary that crumbles without much of a fight. Gale's character loses all depth and he just becomes a soulless soldier. The setting is bland and colorless (literally). Who wants to spend the majority of a book stuck in a bunker or straggling through devastated wastelands? The epilogue is rushed and doesn't really explain anything about how Katniss went from psycho burn victim to loving wife and mother. Katniss' combat training and &#34;special forces&#34; mission is laughable, even for someone with only rudimentary knowledge of military tactics.<br /><br />Fortunately, experiencing this trilogy should not be too painful for anyone because even though it goes completely off the rails, it was never that good to begin with. Sure, it could have been done better, but it could never have been great. Suzanne Collins is simply not a great author even at her best, at least not great enough for her work to make an emotional connection with this reader.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I saw catching fire and It left me stunned I wanted to find out what happens in mocking Jay and it was awesome it was a great book
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Some surprises but I enjoy Grisham's books always and this is up there with the best of them.  Parts of it are a real page-turner!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it is almost like subway suffers but they have minions instead of people, also both games have diff. costumes. the dave is also very cute in the begging of that video.
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games is just an outstanding read! I loved it so much and the series its self just gets better and better. If you like<br /><br />a book with action, suspense, and intense combat you will LOVE the Hunger Games. It really doesn't get you bored at really any<br /><br />point in the book also. The character development may be a little boring as a negative however. Over all if you still debating<br /><br />whether to get this book, GET IT!
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|I do not think this game is appropriate for little children to play and therefore it should not be popular.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun app to teach children about horses. Great fun for grandparents and grandkids to interact. Have a lot of fun playing with the horses.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|BEST BOOK I'VE READ!  This is one of the best book ever. I liked the book better then the movie. U should read this book.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great game but a lot of grinding unless u want to pay.  The game doesn't get much more complex than the first fight.  Just more robots. Would be nice to see some customization options to make the robots more individual
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game,even if I am stuck sometimes I somehow manage to pass the level sometimes it just takes a while. All the way up to level 370 now and still love it. I have not purchased any help items so you can pass the levels without just need patience and a deep breath here and there.
B00BEIYL6G|1.0|I watched the movie for the first 10 minutes and then close it for good. Kutcher's capture of Jobs with that mutated movement accent strike me as a mockery for his image more than reconstructing the past giant's image. I have high appreciation on Jobs as business person who's almost single handedly bring Apple from scrapyard to the top. I just can't stand seeing Kutcher being bald , hunch his back wearing skinny pants when his eyes are flickering smile anytime hes appearing as the older Jobs.<br /><br />Kutcher's too young, those acting skill that he displayed is counter-productive in this movie,if you would find a actor to portrait Jobs, you find Danial Lewis, George Gooney, or even jokster Jim Carrey would behave 100 times better than Kutcher's premature teenager craps.  Terribly miscast of the century.
0375815996|5.0|Cute and easy read! We love the bird you can move from page to page. Your kiddo will love this as well.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|The Compound Effect shows how important are the little things that you do in life in a daily way and it's effect in the long haul.<br />The future relies on my choices, my habits, my consistency and attitude.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is a great movie to see in 3-D.  The movie of course is interesting enough and 3-D just adds to the enjoyment.
B008602KQI|5.0|It was so much better then I thought going to see the new one this weekend, will watch it again
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Enjoyed the book. It was a fun easy read. The characters were very likable. I would read more from this author.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This made Liam Neeson great again as an actor of the cinema. Really a great performance. Similar to John Travolta in Paris with love
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Too much legal process, not enough intrigue.  I was getting impatient with the story line about halfway through the book.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This is the best season since the 1st season of the series. The girls are really becoming great in the series
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I think it is much better than your last game like real steel 1 but 2 is so much better because it has not yet seen robots and power ups like double damage for 15 seconds<br />And I like how the game just is BEST GAME EVER
B000VNMMR0|4.0|This is the movie that brought back the Die Hard series as relevant action series. One for the collection of DVDs
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the challenges and the differences on each floor as you go up.  Lots of different puzzles and games that are different on every level.
B002413TY2|4.0|Liked movie, but this is better than the 2nd transporter but not as good as the 1st..get this one of the series
034580404X|5.0|Love it.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|An entire new way to look at the Japanese culture and the sport of drifting. Film took a little bit before it got going.
0553381407|5.0|Love it.
B001HN6918|5.0|Top Notch Movie.  Excellent execution by the graphic designers, and it has a great message for the audience:  Let go of the past and live in the now..... or as Seth says, The Point of Power is the Present.  Great Movie for sure.
B006C45MRE|4.0|I like the actors and even though it was science fiction, it was damned good entertainment.  A bit over the top in spots, but the action and suspense was good.  At any rate, it WAS different!!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Very interesting twist for explaining what life means. I was glad that the characters remained the same through to the end. I enjoyed the fact that Theo did not \\"reform\\" his life and end up as a Prince Charming.
0525478817|5.0|I really loved this book.  Holt McDougal is a very talented writer.  One could say that this book is very John Green-esque.  Seriously, if you like John Green, this Holt McDougal is the next best thing.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was concerned at first when I purchased all the books. The reviews for the third volume were way less complimentary. Having read all the books, I can see why some people may not have liked book 3. If you're completely entranced by book 1 and you want to just have life be exactly what you thought it was when you first entered Divergent, feel free to stay there. Be deluded that everything is what you think it is. But Life is never like that. It's never just one layer deep--whether we're talking about the internal or the external world. Life is more complicated than you thought. So if you like being challenged to see a much bigger picture--one that wobbles and shakes, and is most likely going to betray you--then dig into book 3. It's more tragic and yet more &#34;real life&#34; than you might have expected. And it was worth all the investment I'd made into reading the Divergent Series. Besides, humanity isn't much different now from any &#34;then&#34; you choose (in history or future). And humanity will keep making the same mistakes. But it's still worth living.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Wow, what can I say but WOW!<br />I'm looking forward to reading Drums of Autumn. For someone who has never really enjoyed reading, this series has me hooked!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Its Pink Floyd. That's all you need to know. Classic. I liked it almost as much as the Delicate Sound of Thunder concert video.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked this book, but I was a little disappointed by the ending.  This was the first Gillian Flynn book that I had read.  I will definitely read more of her work.
B00G70WLJA|2.0|I just dont understand how they make so many bad to mediocre Marvel movies, when the source material is already out there. They have an amazing character in wolverine, why dont they really open him up and use interesting opponents. This movie is bland, and no better then Origins. The villains are lame and poorly used. Kind of like Spiderman 3.<br /><br />While it was interesting to see wolverine flirt with mortality and become more human, its old hat by now, so many super hero movies try to make the protagonist vulnerable and mortal, etc.. its been done to death.<br /><br />Most of this movie wolverine is fighting yakuza thugs. I mean, my god, open some marvel comics and pick some villains. You have a badass like wolverine and the best ya can do is thugs! This movie is like a lamborghini that doesn't go over 20 MPH<br /><br />The chicks in the movie are not all that attractive, they could have done better, it's not like the acting was so good to warrant them<br /><br />I regret purchasing this, wished I had waited to rent it for a dollar.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am so engrossed in the lives of Eva and Gideon Cross!  I can't wait for more!  The storyline is great!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thought it was the greatest book I have never read. It was a testament to time. I loved it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is the best at weaving stories that are so engaging.  His books make me never want to stop reading.  His character development is so well-done that you feel like you know the characters personally.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|The season was kind of slow but the mid season has shock value. I have loved the entire series.  Cant wait for February.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Absolutely one of her best books I have ever read. Could not put it down until I finished it. I read it over a year ago but I bought it again when I heard that a movie was coming out in December. I am reading it again before I,see,the movie. This is a must read book. I am hoping the movie stays true to the book.
B00GUJP9PG|5.0|I love this app it has multiplayer so u can play with your friends u guys should really get this apps
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Works just fine in my HP CP1525NW color Laser printer.  Cuts down on the amount of time it takes for the printer to process a color print job and helps out with spooling several print jobs at once.  My kids and I use this printer a great deal, expanding the RAM was a very cheap solution to addressing the amount it is used.<br /><br />Very good price and quick delivery.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|The 1st one was awesome to but now they have multiplayer so now me and my bros can play it:-)
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Difficult to play, control the character, no instruction for play that I could find, unclear plot.  This was a free giveaway on Amazon's free app of the day, and while the description was intriguing the play was actually confusing and difficult to control. Uninstalled.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Requires patience but not a lot of skill.<br />Does require some critical thinking.<br />Great way to pass time.<br />reat way to pass time.
B001NA6096|1.0|It was a 24 hour rental and I never got a chance to watch it as it wouldn't play from my ipad Amazon app nor through my computer so I lost the opportunity. Probably would have given it a 4-5 star based upon previous research. I'll go through apple store next time so I don't lose my investment.
B000JIN3J8|5.0|The best casting ever. I think this is the truest adaptation of Pride and Prejudice I have seen, no offense to Colin Firth.
B00006JL1Z|1.0|I imagine that the music is great.....however it is blocked from putting on my MP3 player or onto my computer.  Does this mean that I have to do my run with my boom box on my shoulder?  I am very disappointed, because I love their music....this has never happened to me before!
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I would give this a No Star rating if I could.  What a sloppy book - rambling, overwritten, under edited.  There is some fine writing, there are some interesting characters, there are some fascinating plot lines, but...I found it shapeless, repetitive and tedious, and could not be bothered to finish it.  I loved &#34;Secret History.&#34;  Shame on the editor?  Perhaps.  The hype and rave reviews elude me.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I am a huge fan of this girl!  Her courage, grace and devotion to education for the girls of her country are a true inspiration.  When I started reading the book, I was impressed by the amount of history and the clarity with which she explained the volatility of her region.  I learned a great deal about the situations in Pakistan and Afganistan by reading this book, as well as about her family and her life.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Keep finding myself going back to this one!  Addictive, strategic and the boards progress so you never get bored. Great game, almost out of boards :(
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|This is a fun game!! Add me, my id is FAVKOOT!!! It is a fun game to help you pass time and it is very similar to farmville on facebook.
B00BEIYN3M|3.0|There were some really funny parts in this movie and some pretty lame ones too.  However, no one can complain about a very sexy Jennifer Aniston portraying a stripper!  I love blu ray too!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I was very happy with the quality of this game. It was entertaining and easy enough for the kids to play. I especially liked that there was a narrator who read out loud, but I would like to see I little more interaction and/or more challenging for the $ that was spent. Keep up the good work
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is an addicting game and lots of fun for the whole family.  We've spent hours of enjoyable playing. Try it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and the entire series. 5 stars from me.<br />Oh by the way, I am 67 years old.<br />Good writing knows no age limits.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Mos t little girls dream of having a pony when they grow up, but I'd suggest to their parents to have their kid play this game first. It teaches the responsibility of raising a horse, but with small goal that have rewards. It's encouraging and easy to learn from.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like the game but you shouldn't have a limit on how many lives you have. For example I lost the game pressed &quot;replay game&quot; and it said you have to wait ten minutes to get more lives. That is just screwed up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I think it is great because if you have children you can let them play and they will leave you alone for a good hour or two its adventurous and fun for kids but I must worn you do NOT pay this game in the car while you are driving because you will get sick trust me
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive and challenging but extremely FUN. It's exciting when the power ups start exploding. I guess I'm easily entertained. Good first thing in the morning.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Very very good game I have wanted a game like this for a long time  I am happy I downloaded this game only thing I don't like is energy.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is a great movie for anyone, and it is one of my favorites. It has singing, comedy, romance, and much more. I love it.
B008H6GH8I|4.0|Good movie to watch if your a fan of the series an diffent must have. All I need now is the new movie coming out next year and my collection will be complete. I have resident evil 1-5 plus the two animated moves
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Every time I try to open it it doesn't work!!! It is really annoying!!!  I love the game but it seriously needs an update!!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I am a Walking Dead fan head so nothing that they produce is les than 5 stars for me. A bit slower than the previous seasons but that is good because it allows more depth to be created by each of the actors.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|this app would not install for Me at all. I tried several times but no sucsess.  could creator please fix this haven't been able to use the browser,  something wrong
B0053F042G|3.0|Interesting story line that was supported by good acting. I enjoyed the film. Nothing too exciting to jump up and down about
B002BU0DPE|4.0|One of the best Turtle Beach headsets out there thats wired. You can only buy it online now because stores sell the X-12's now.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|It's Dr. Who - what else is there to say! BBC are getting really good at certain things - drama, British comedy and Dr. Who.....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You guys have the  best game ever I play it almost everyday and it is so fun for my family
B001RUXW48|3.0|Fast paced, good action movie, crappy story line that unfortunately is probably closer to the truth than we would like. Worth watching.
B000IZA9NU|5.0|I love all the star treks, but this is definitely a good one. Be sure to have tissues near by for the ending though! =P
B001P36OY2|3.0|So so story line. acting was okay but nothing special. Good movie if you want to watch something and turn your brain off.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|This was personally one of my favorite video complications madonna has done so far and any madonna fan would most likely enjoy this
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|Good action, great actresses - Kate Beckonsale and Jessica Biel are amazing! Did not bother watching any of the other actors! Story line was not exactly great, but it was passable!
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I got this book because I needed for school and its a book we are reading as a class a home and I really like it I lost mine at school so I got it in Amazon
B0015DROBO|5.0|What a wonderful page turner.  It,s a good thing that I,m on vacation and could take the time to read it almost end to end.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite carnival games. I was so happy when I found this for my kindle fire. Now I can play it whenever I want to.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|A more realistic view of the Superman genre. It explains a lot answers about where the character got his strength, and the backdrop on General Zod. I found the movie different and refreshing.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|The game is exciting and I love shooting the birds, LOL.  I play the game for hours on end.  Fun
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this game is the best this took me months I was looking for this crewmen. game and.

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Every book I have read by Nicholas Sparks has been great, so I knew this one would too. This book was quite different and kept be guessing until the end. I found myself walking around reading because I just HAD to know what was going to happen. The ending is not what you think and it gives me chills just thinking about it. MUST READ!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I seen lots of others saying this is amazing for 1$ or 25$ but this game is really 5$ I hope it's good LOL monster out
B004ODLUGM|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD rendition of the book and actually improves on the story.  I thought the Gruffalo would come off as scary but apparently not to my granddaughter.  Highly recommend both the book and the dvd
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It's a nice app, I use it whenever I'm baby sitting or need to take a nap. It's a dry peaceful way for me to get up with MY music, and not some obnoxious beeping noise. I would recommend it to those who are looking for a nice, free alarm clock that is fairly reliable and can connect to Pandora or your playlists.
1936891026|5.0|I enjoyed learning how artists and others resist their dreams, in this little book. I read it in digestible portions as it tends to pack a wallop. Work will take on a new aura, one may release blocks and you discover just how professional you really are.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Excellent game that has ridiculously awesome replay value. They keep adding more and more interesting things to the game to keep it fresh. I highly recommend upgrading the Boomerang Monkey's hut because one of those can basically get you through the first 40 levels. Ice Tower plus Boomerang Monkey = unbeatable.
B00G3HSF7O|2.0|it was't what was expected for matt damon movie it was not profund enough and the spport actors don't have it
B0027MJU00|5.0|Lots going on here but if you like intricate plots that briskly move in and out of different related scenes, you'll love this one
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use the night and nature sounds to fall asleep every night. I do wish there was a way to control speed at which sound patterns repeat, but this app does offer a lot of customization options, and variety of sounds I haven't found in any other apps like this. Really like timer feature.
B0055D3EOG|2.0|Very '70s-ish.  VERY.  Concept was not bad, but the rest of the movie was pretty close.  Not worth the rental fee.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is amazing!  I cannot wait until the next version comes out.  I have played it several times over.
006202406X|1.0|I can't say anything that everyone before me hasn't. By the time I got to the part that was  supposed to be \\"heartbreaking\\" and \\"controversial\\" I was having a hard time keeping my eyes open. Someone must have slipped me some peace serum. I'm not even angry about how stupid this book is....I'm just irritated and disappointed with how this author assumed that I was so mentally stunted that I would be willing to accept this book as a logical ending. I HATED every character I loved before. I felt NOTHING for characters I hated before. I actually wondered if something with the Kindle order had gotten screwed up and I was accidentally sent a really stupid book instead of \\"Allegiant.\\" 500+ pages later and I'm still clinging to a distant hope that it will have some redeeming quality.<br /><br />Now, this lazy author will get no more of my patronage since she insulted me with this installment. I no longer wish to see the movie adaptations, either.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Endlessly entertaining.  Get all the jewels - then try for the lowest possible moves.  One problem, at least with the Fire HD 8.9&#34; is that everything stores in memory from session to session except the perfect scores attained.  All those hard-fought-for golden check boxes turn back to grey every time the game is restarted - taking away (at least visually) the satisfaction of knowing that you've done well.  At least the colorful jewels remain colorful!

B003B02O0A|2.0|His was a wonderful prequel to Sycamore Row. SPELLBINDING. Another must by Grisham. Reminds us of the culture not too far back in modern time.
B003WJQ74E|3.0|I really enjoyed the story line but there were a lot of drawn out moments. My kids read this in school, the impact wasn't very big but they did enjoy it. It made them sad more than anything.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is so fun I recommend this to any one and it is not just deer<br /> It is also Brighton sheep bears wolves
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It's filled with good action, great storyline. I gave it four out of five stars only because at times the explainations of a procedure or reason why something was carried out, became rather drawn out and tedious. But, I must say that Lee Child's books are interesting enough for me to order the next and the next, and so on!
B000IDEORY|4.0|Well, we are a young couple. However, Me and my wife love this movie!! It brings us back many memories... Super-recommended!
B001EC3JME|5.0|My Husband and daughter use them for hunting and work. They say it is the best holder they have ever had, you don't have to worry about the light coming out it holds what you put in it..
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This app is very handy. I have used it more than most other apps. It is not necessary but it is convenient.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I loved this story as a little girl and it is so good that I can pass it on to my girls. It is timeless right up there with Wizard of Oz. Tho the story is nothing like Oz.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I am almost done reading this book. David Baldacci writes a very good and easily followed main character in Will Robie. Suspensful just as is expected.
B003CSV7TK|4.0|This is more of the &#34;Good Old Fashion&#34; story I like.  It has a good moral to it and the acting was supurb.
0470876417|5.0|Great book for anyone one developing or improving a business idea. Steve Blank teaches a free online course by the same name which uses the book as a guide.
B00G4I11YQ|5.0|Great Movie that tells the story of these Orca whales.  Taking these whales out of their natural (huge) ocean habitat and keeping them in essentially a bathtub for their lifetime is just wrong...
B000ICLRIE|2.0|I never saw this film in theaters, and only gave it a chance due to some friends saying the Director's Cut version of this film was epic.<br />I should NOT have listened to them, because this movie is an overlong bore. I typically like Ridley Scott, but this is definitely not one of his best films. NOT RECOMMENDED
B00EDOS6IC|4.0|I remember what got me into these guys. A post on Sevendust's Chapter 7 album where someone was going on and on about these guys and my response was something similar to thinking they'd be another nickelcraind of a deadman. Well they're definitely in the alternative rock genre, though it's funny I thought that about them given the musicians in the band and what band they were in before. Don't let any of that get in your way. This is a fairly solid band, and this is a fantastic release.<br /><br />I didn't think they could top Blackbird which was a pretty good album, my second favorite of the to date 4, but they've done it here. Where AB3 was full of mostly ballads this one rocks a majority of the way through, which I love. The sound is great, good production. Everyone's instruments/vocals are easily heard. The songwriting is great, and the musicianship is fairly solid.<br /><br />Cry Of Achelies 10/10 starts the album off well with a nice blend of melody and rocking. We are treated to an acoustic intor before a fairly heavy rock set of guitar riffs. The verses seem to mix between heavy and a little softer, and the chorus is catchy, and there's a good solo as well. There's so much going on in this song and this is becoming one of my favorite Alter Bridge songs. This song borders on being prog rock, at 61/2 minutes, though no it doesn't sound anything like Dream Theater nor Rush. Simply an amazing song though.<br /><br />Addicted To Pain 9/10 is the follow up track, and I think first single and it's a good one. Nice pacing fast paced, good rocking song with a good chorus. it's definitely more straight forward than the previous song, but it's a nice change.<br /><br />Bleed It Dry 8/10 starts off with almost a metal sounding riff with fast paced that turns slower drumming. The verses are a slower pace, and there's a decent riff going in there. it's not as heavy as the intro would suggest, but it's still a good rock song with a nice chorus. There's also a nice slower section.<br /><br />Lover 6/10 is the first ballad of the album. It's ok, but when I first heard it I thought I wouldn't like it at all. Well it's decent they pretty much use the same melody for the verses and the chorus, which is kind of annoying, but the melody works really well for both a verse and chorus, so I can see why they did that. Overall it's ok, but not my favorite.<br /><br />The uninvited 7/10 Starts with a slow soft intro that gets heavier. This one's a slower rocker.<br /><br />Peace Is Broken 8/10 This is a slower rocker with a great riff in the verses, and a great chorus.<br /><br />Calm The Fire 9/10 starts with an intro that sounds very much like Muse. The verses also sound very much like a heavier version of something Muse might do. It's faster and a good rock song. The chorus sounds more typical Alter Bridge. Overall this is one of my favorite songs on here.<br /><br />Farther Than The Sun 8/10 is a slower tempo rocker. Again some nice riffing going on there. There are some nice vocal melodies. The song picks up tempo during the solo, which is well played. I like both the solo and the rhythm guitars played behind it.<br /><br />Cry A River /10 is a more up tempo rocker. We've had mostly rockers to this point which suits my tastes just fine. This one's one of the better songs on the album. It has strong guitar work and solid vocals. The rhythm section does their jobs nicely as well. I like the change in drum beats during the extended chorus for the second chorus.<br /><br />All Ends Well 7/10 it's intro reminds me of the beginning of a song from the most recent Creed album. I believe it was the title track. This one's a ballad. Mostly acoustic guitars with some electric in the chorus. The chorus is pretty good. I don't love the build to it, but it's ok. Overall it's a decent song though.<br /><br />Fortress 8/10 is the beast of the album. This one's roughly 7 1/2 minutes, and is definitely proggy. It starts with some soft guitars and drums. This ends up being the first verse. The vocals as usual are very solid. The chorus is heavier and has a good amount of power behind it. The instrumental break gets much heavier and is probably one of the heaviest moments in their career with a nice guitar riff and solo. This is what seperates this from your typical softer Alter Bridge song. then there's another clean guitar part leading to the final verse. This is a very ambitious piece for them and it comes of very well.<br /><br />Overall if you like good modern hard rock or are a fan of the band this is definitely an album to check out. If they keep releasing albums this good they'll be in danger of becoming one of my favorite bands.
B00555X8OA|5.0|This was a surprisingly great read.  I knew the book was a bestseller for some time, and I saw that it was super cheap on the Kindle, so for some reason I got it.  It was really long, and I was not sure about the topic, but once I started reading it, a few things happened.  I realized that a ton of people have quoted it in other books.  This book or the research behind it is highly influential.  Over and over again, a few of the topics were addressed in other works.  This was great because you always want to read the origin of material.  The passed down stuff is never as good.  And if the book has been quoted often, it means it is significant.  Second of all, it was fascinating.  Over and over again, I learned to think better, to understand my mind and the weaknesses of system one or system two thinking, and how these systems can help or hurt me.  It is an academic read, but one that is practical.  You will see your thinking in a better light through this book.  Also, it is a good read.  The chapters are short, which means the book go by faster, for being a long book.  You might think that you do not care about the topic to such a level, but it is easy to read, so it is worth it.  I wish I highlighted this book more, because of the richness of the material.  It was so deep that it is worth going back and looking at again.  There is too much to mention all of the detail, but it is a great read, and I really loved the text.  Give it a try.  Also, it is even cheaper today, it is 2.99.  So of the best money ever spent.
B004G6009U|4.0|I love this movie, but realized while rewatching it that it does reinforce gender stereotypes in some ways. Also, when &#34;mother Gothel&#34; tells Rapunzel she's &#34;gettin' kinda chubby,&#34; it is completely out of place, has nothing to do with what they're discussing, and Rapunzel is very thin. Young girls have enough media telling them they have to be skinny to have value, and there's no reason to put that message into children's fairy tales.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Great book for anyone who wants to read about adventure, taking a stand and life decisions. Interesting story and well written.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Incredible show with up-to-the-moment twists and turns.  Very engaging.  I can't believe we weren't aware of it before our recent viewing.  Can't wait to watch the rest!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Awesome book!  I have run over 100 miles since reading the book just over a month ago.  Before that, a bad back and bad knees had me down and getting fat.  I think this book may have changed my life.  Time will tell.  For now, I just want to run.
B00DBOF5Q6|5.0|Brilliant. Great writing. I was expecting it to be a bit of a one-sided rant, and I am so glad I was wrong.I rebounded out of Barracuda by Chris Tsiolkas into this, and it was a huge relief to find great writing, characterisations and plot. I really did not want this read to end. I think it shows that you can show awful characters and events and yet still imbue them with an empathy.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book is a fairly easy and quick read. Though I would say it is a must read. A beautiful tale of two young children and a garden growing from something not quite appealing to beautiful beings.
1577314808|5.0|This book is a great read, it will open your mind to new ideas that once absorbed will truly change your world experience!
0739352989|5.0|This triology is absolutely amazing! I cannot put it down. I find myself still up at 2am reading it. I love Christian, and I love the headstrong Ana with him. Their passion and love is without doubt addictive. No wonder, this is a novel. I don't think such a man exists - loving, giving, doting, handsome, rich, willing to share..albeit a little overbearing and jealous..he is still willing to give up everything he knows for love. Who does that? And not even a pre-nup. he says &#34;If you leave me, Ana, you might as wll take everything&#34;. I absolutely love him, and cannot wait to read every night. Now I am almost done and wonder what new novel I can read with the same sort of passion to fill my nights.<br />I will get the audio, and then wauit for the movie out in 2015.<br />I do hope Jamie Dornan can play the part well. I have a picture of Christian in my mind - and he is not it. I hope he can convince me otherwise. Doesn't Christian have dirty blonde hair? I am not feeling it for Dakota as Ana - at all. I still think Sean and his fianc&eacute;e (bachelor) should play the 2 parts. It should come naturally for them. They are already lovers.<br />E.L James, you did a good job. Is this from true life events? You seem to have written their sexual encounters in great detail :)
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Best book I read last year. The writing style and time line were great.  It would be easy to see a novel or a movie written about each story I'm the book
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is one of the best episodes of Castle. It was made for fans specifically, the best clip show ever!!!
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|I thought this was a very beautifully rendered point-and-click adventure game. I finished the game in about an hour though. It's only a dollar, so I can't really complain, but I think the game would've been better if it was longer and maybe priced a little higher to compensate. I just feel like it was only half of a game, like they could've done a lot more with it.<br /><br />The puzzles were often too easy, but occasionally far too obscure to notice the connection between the hint and the puzzle. They have a built-in guide to help you in those cases, so it's not necessary to leave the game for outside help. And if you REALLY can't figure a puzzle out, you can have the game solve it for you, so you will never be stuck on a puzzle.<br /><br />No bugs to report, never froze/crashed, etc. All in all, a pretty decent app. Could be made into something better though. Four stars.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Fun and smart and completely absorbing. Best book I've read in a long time. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a whimsical overview of our wild 20th century told via the shuffling feet of a unlikely and lovable protagonist and the gang of misfits he finds on his long journey.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I have never done this but it was interesting.It was really worth the time and effort.  The cost was worth it.
B00F2362IE|5.0|I love teenage mutant ninjas turtle so this game literally made me SO happy! It a lot of fun!! Its also FREE! YES
B008JDAC7G|4.0|The privacy idiots who don't understand how Apps, App Design, and App Verification happen always seem to chime in on how evil the FATD are.<br /><br />Might I suggest those who are serious about reporting on App Privacy, Security, and App Permissions actually something about such topics.<br /><br />For average users - Grab a copy of Lookout. Set it up. Have it perform a real time scan of new app installs. Then stop paying attention to those who complain EVERY day about the &amp;#34;evil&amp;#34; permissions in the FATD.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I did not expect to love this movie, but I did. I have never been a Star Trek fan. I liked the first movie well enough, but thought this one was even better. It's an action-packed, emotional roller coaster ride.
B00E4W40C4|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE!!! cant wait to see it again and again!!!!! if you are a marvel fan or a comic fan. this movie rocks!!!
0785153322|4.0|This will be a gift and has not been opened. I saw one like it and the artwork is very sharp and please the people that are into comics, I mean graphic novels!<br />The box they shipped it in could have had some stuffing in it as one of the book corners got damaged slightly.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Best show ever. I am so addicted to these characters. Each week's episode is intriguing and fun. Keep it coming....
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|We really liked this movie. It was cute and funny with little for the discerning parent to cringe at with children in the vicinity. Overall a good family movie.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is such a fun, smart show. I love the characters and find myself really caring what happens to them and the company. Only wish that Season 3 was on Amazon Prime so I can keep up before Season 4 begins. Love the theme song, Greenback Boogie. (take another piece of pie for your wife).
B0048KXRR6|4.0|It's rare for a sequel to measure up to its original, but this one came close. We liked this story almost as much and recommend it highly!
B00076RT24|1.0|this product was listed &#34;like new.&#34;  That was a joke. The case seemed to have water in it at some point. The plastic covering on the case was also all torn up.  I was very displeased by the way this item was listed and what I actually got.
B00EDY5KTA|5.0|The music in this movie is fantastic and very &#34;broadway-esque&#34; compared to other films. My family and I loved the movie and the soundtrack is just as loved!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|When this says mini pieces, they are NOT kidding. These pieces are so very small. But my nephew LOVED it. He was so very pleased with his birthday present that he had to get into it right away. He loves legos and love mine craft, these two together were genius.
B00GLX0Z8C|3.0|Funny, but not nearly as funny as it could have been! A lot of the jokes and comedy felt &#34;forced&#34; as they went for an over-the-top crude comedic style. Worth watching just for the originality of the movie though so giving it 3 stars.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Excellent book that speaks to old world values so easily lost in today's sometimes 'less conscious' society. Wonderful voices, vivid characters, lovely message. I highly recommend it!
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|IF you've read the book don't watch this! The acting wasn't that good, actors were not what I would of picked, and it did not follow the book well at all. This movie disappointed me.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Purchased this Disney Princess decals with gems along with the Disney castle decal with gems when my granddaughter moved into her Big Girl bed.  It was so easy to stick the decals on her wall and it looked G R E A T!!!!!
B0049J2CKE|5.0|My kids and I love this movie. If your looking for a cute family friendly movie well than this is it.
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|I play this game on multiple devices and my kindle is always the last device to update.  I am on level 25 on my samsung note and level 35 on my kindle.  Due to the continual updates there are more worlds available on the samsung and I am in a continual loop on my kindle with no new worlds opening.
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|look all those people that like this game should know that there is a &quot;more awesomer&quot; game out there by the same developer, and guess what? it's FREE. it is called BLOONS TD BATTLES, and it is much cooler. better graphics, and people to play against. this app is GREAT for the computer, but td battles is great for the tablet, In fact, much better than this one for the tablet. it should be on the recommended apps button. soooooo get it it is so cool and sooooo much better.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was my first book by Kate Morton.  I think the title caught my eye.  Very detailed mystery and it was good to the end.  Now I've read all of her books.
B00GT4V5DM|5.0|It's one of the best anti-malware around. The best thing that MalwareBytes has is the price. Just  thirty dollars and that's it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great for Netflix and Youtube.  Would be 5 stars if I could watch ABC shows online with it also.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|6 yr old grand-daughter wants to watch this every time she comes to my house.  She loves it and I love watching it with her.  Great acting and beautifully done.
