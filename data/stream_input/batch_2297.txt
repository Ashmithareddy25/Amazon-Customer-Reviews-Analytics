B00151G08Y|5.0|Pendulum is an awesome band. I love the music, every song has me wanting to dance.<br /><br />My only problem is that the CD was not in shrink wrap. I am not sure whether I accidentally bought it used, but it doesn't matter, because the disc and jewel case were in like-new condition.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Always awesomely accurate. I love the 15 day satellite because it is usually spot on! This is much more reliable than my local news forecast.
B005V1WVPA|4.0|I've never heard such a mix of metal and electronic music. KoRn and Skrillex make a sound that will rock your skull!
B00005R24K|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies.  I was very excited when I found it online and when I bought it.  It came fast and in good condition! The only thing is is that it came and the case was chipped and cracked. but nothing too bad.
B006R6ZP6U|1.0|Excessive, unnecessary and pointless violence made this film inappropriate for anyone. OK. I get it. The French are bad guys. But kicking a kitten into meat grinder ? This was very upsetting to my children. And how come in all this mayhem, Matt Damon's hair never gets mussed ! All in all, pretty lame.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies.  I was very excited when I found it online and when I bought it.  It came fast and in good condition!
B004GJXQ20|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the book is hard getting into, but once you go over first half there is no putting it down. Great read.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is really fun to edit photos with, I use it all the time. If you've never liked editing photos: well think again! This app is not as complex as the others - I highly recommend it.

B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is one of the most original storylines I have read.  It takes you to our very own future in which the world's fate is put in the hands of children...children that have been raised and trained in zero gravity combat who all just happen to be exceedingly intelligent.  Little Ender Wiggins is our one and only hope as he is forced through rigorous simulated battle and pushed to the breaking point.  You want to help him and root for him at the same time.  It is a story for the record books.  Coincidently it will be made into a movie and released in November.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are amazing. I wanted to try out the cheapest version and this sets a great example. I am so addicted!

B005LAIGN2|5.0|After all these years, The Tuskegee Airmen finally have their story told on the big screen.  Yes, there was an HBO movie and other mini-movies/productions of the airmen from previous years.  I'm extremely proud to know the REAL American heroes, their determination, their battle with racism and never giving up hope.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|addicting so much fun cant stop playing. all the graphics sounds very mesmerising. a must download. and to top it off its free!
B0050DZN4K|3.0|I came over to Feedly as a Google Reader transplant and I like it but it's missing the ability to skip to the next story within a blog. It also doesn't show all the blogs in a category and you end up missing a lot of blogs that a blogger may have posted. It's better than nothing but could be better.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I never read a Kindle book of this length.  Still reading it and I'm only to 9%.  I'm just now getting to the good stuff.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I gotta say... I loved the first half of the book like crazy and totally couldn't let it down. I was almost in love with Holder myself! He seemed like the perfect amount of mysterious, sweet, sensitive, caring, etc. There was definitely quite a lot of confusion with his behavior though. I had quite a good few laughs here and there which always signifies how down to earth the characters are... but 3/4 way into the book it gets totally twisted real quick for a second... a bit dark. You'll read the reveal of why Holder has been acting super in love and happy one second and super angry and pissy the next with Sky. Not sure how I felt about that entirely but nonetheless the book and characters gave a very motivating and moving story. A book about hope, will, strength in the ones you love but mostly yourself.
B00005S6K8|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I have watched Sabrina-especially since purchasing it. Very cute-very romantic and how can you beat Harrison Ford? Condition of the DVD was excellent.
B00ATP24SW|5.0|OK everybody including me, were waiting for this release. Some didn't like it, many did. Rating's speak for themselves, you should give it a listen, you'll not be disappointed! It's truly a great piece of work and clearly shows the direction of Stratovarius.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|This is the Matt Smith's Doctor! He really hits his stride in this one and has found his voice. The scripts are brilliant, the acting sublime, and even the special effects are getting better! This set also includes the best Christmas special to date, 'A Christmas Carol' starring the always wonderful Michael Gambon.<br /><br />If you're a Doctor Who fan, you must buy this set, immediately.
B003E35MQC|5.0|Heard this album when it first came out.  Was completely floored by &#34;wood choppers ball&#34;.  Just as strong today!  Great stuff
B003EV6DBW|4.0|The title of this review seems to contradict my 4-star rating. Allow me to elaborate. This is not David Tennant's Doctor (note the box art). Unfortunately, it seems that no one told Matt Smith this until towards the end of this series. Only in the last few episodes do we get a real glimpse of Smith's take on our favorite Time Lord. However, when it clicks, it really clicks. The scripts are still strong, the new companions are fun, and watching Smith step into this massive role and make it his own is a blast.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|I don't generally watch drama movies but this movie had enough humor and great acting to keep it from being depressing. Most movies nowadays aren't worth watching twice but this movie is not one of them.
0062231375|5.0|I've been told repeatedly over the years that this book is worth my time. All of those people were 100% correct. Bourdain's style is approachable and earthy, while being casually informative and compelling. In this book, he discusses bits of his past, some of his working history, and his thoughts on food and life. As an added bonus, you also get handwritten notes by Bourdain as he revisits this novel a dozen years later. It's an interesting extra layer to an already solid novel. I liked it so much that I've already ordered some of his other books as well.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|**Spoiler Alert***<br />I LOVE this book! It was really interesting and kept me reading until the end. Say what you want,but when Percy and Annabeth fell into Tartarus, it was so sad that I cried a little (ok, I cried a lot) until I found out that they weren't dead. I can't wait until the next book comes out!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I find this app to be quite useful. The speakers on the Kindle Fire makes whatever song you choose really loud, so unless you're a heavy sleeper or really tired, there's no way you could sleep through it.
B008KW43TE|3.0|I'm not sure what all the hype was about with this album. The lyrics sound like a guy that's not very smart trying to sound deep and thoughtful. I'm not that into it and feel like I was duped. I'll give it another try but after 1.5 listens, I'm not a fan.
B000005RMY|5.0|I received all items intact and unspoiled. Package seemed brand new, and all songs playable. No damages or skips to disc
B000W93CHC|4.0|It tends to be a repeat in many ways of The Pillars of the Earth as far as the plot. However, Follett has an amazing way of creating characters that entrance a reader. Very enjoyable read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game will make you put the rest of your thing down and hope on it, to me it is better then temple run, cause u don't have to twist your devices move the character by sliding your dinger on the screen...<br />SO WHAT R U WAITING 4 DOWNLOAD IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Incredible, inspiring movie. This movie really shines a spotlight on the qualities that made Lincoln a great man and a great leader. Just awesome!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a little small on the kindle fire but you can zoom in on the rooms to view them better do it isn't s deal breaker.  Really nice graphics.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I made my acquaintance with Mr. Rodriguez through &#34;searching for sugarman&#34; - and I was totally taken by his lyrics, music and performance. how is it possible that such a genius escaped the public attention is beyond me
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I had pretty low expectations for this film, I'll admit.  However, I found it to be funny and featured some good music.  It's now my go-to movie on the plane since it's basically suitable for any audience and can be watched again and again.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I made my acquaintance with Mr. Rodriguez through &#34;searching for sugarman&#34; - and I was totally taken by his lyrics, music and performance. how is it possible that such a genius escaped the public attention is beyond me
B004XCM89M|1.0|I think this is one of the funniest comedies in a long time, just silly, obscene, and over the top. The problem is, this is not an American blu-ray disk, it's from somewhere in Europe, and wouldn't play in my blu-ray player. I have ordered a few disks from Amazon.com and this has never happened before. I just wanted to write this to warn American buyers. BUYER BEWARE!!!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I loved Denzel's performance in this movie. Along with a great supporting cast, this movie portrays Whip's (Denzel Washington) beautiful struggle with alcohol and substance addiction. It is definitely a slower movie if you're used to non-stop-action-type-of-films, but where it lacks in violence it makes up with complex character development.
B00190OHD6|1.0|I guess it must just be me, judging from the other reviews, but I found this movie extremely depressing.  I cried through much of it.  In the beginning, I felt bad for Gerard Butler's character who was engaging and adorable but who had to deal with a bitchy, self-centered, unreasonable wife.  Then for the rest of the movie the grief process was so painful to watch.  Anyone that has suffered through a painful loss in the past will identify with the wife's pain.  The efforts of friends and family to help were relatively useless and not that enjoyable to watch either.  I disliked the twist at the end, and the assumption that William was the guy for her because he had a nice body was sort of disgusting.  Here she had just gone through a profound grief experience and she is supposed to be all happy again because she falls into bed with a nice-looking guy.  Please.  Gerard Butler was the real star of the movie, and his role in the film was minimal.  I would not recommend it unless you are eager to experience suffering along with the Hilary Swank character and watch scene after scene of her selfish, obnoxious behavior.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Do you like psychological thrillers that aren't necessarily the gruesome kind or the overly romanticized serial killer variety? Then this is for you. Not amazing writing, but who cares? It's addictive to the point I snuck a read at work quite often on Kindle for PC (shhhh) don't expect to fall in love with the characters, but do expect to be drawn into a world of somewhat unlikable people.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Thank you i love it - got her fast and in good timeing. highly recommended thank you very much! - jessica
B006LSZECO|2.0|My kindle fire app had this book on its best books of the year app, so I gave it a shot. I'm usually pleased with most books I read, but in this book, by the end, you end up hating the characters all so much you just don't care what happens. And the resolution was no resolution at all. Not even a good cliff hanger, it was just empty.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I had tried a few battery apps before this. The really didn't do much except occupy space. Some were not giving the correct percentage. I finally stumbled upon this app and I thought it was awesome. It can calibrate your device so you can know how much time you have left until you need to charge. You can even make it tell you what percent it is. It lets you know how much time it will take to charge it at the current level. I recommend getting this app even if you don't care about your device's batterly life!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|so much fun!  Our whole family plays!  There are always new dragons to get and feed.  Easy to follow and fun to play.  You can play all by yourself

0765325950|5.0|I have been a true fan from the start and have read the stories several times, I want to express a \\"Thank you!\\" I loved being able to read the WOT series, escape reality, relax and \\"enjoy the ride.\\" I can't believe it's over. For a fan who couldn't wait for the next book, then couldn't put the book down, I am so so sad it is over. I want more.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is so adicting I can never put it down my mom has to yell at me and poor water on my head to get my attention.  yes it is that good.  its better than mind craftvit is such a great free game you should totally get it if you don't scrue you this game is awesome.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Awesome DVD Set. Perfect gift for anyone that is a fan of the Nolan trilogy. Really well priced. A great deal.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Good book,  however it bothered me that the characters were so young. Grey should've been at least 30. If your looking for believability  that is.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Really liked the story. Was a little different that was is normally made into movies. Acting was good also. I would recommended it.
1451627297|5.0|I'm not a history buff....but this makes you think.<br />His writing is predictable-but I like his words and his creative thoughts are provoking.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Loved it! Can't wait to read book 3. Stop making people write more words. Just just not not fun fun
B003E8P9G0|4.0|This book was really good. I love the way ancient mythology collides with everyday life for Carter and Sadie. Struggling with their loss is even harder as they fight chaos. Both characters have real feelings and ideas. Though they must act as if they were older at times to fight, they are kids. At times they act like it, and at other times they don't.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow this book is breath taking . From the beginning you try to understand what was happening and why . As the story unfolds you realize how much you've come to love Katie and her strength . When she meets Alex you are so glad to see that she can heal and be better . The bug fight at the end just leaves you guessing and hoping that Katie and Alex and the kids will be alright and the suspense in this part is just horrible to live through but worth it . The end with the letter will leave you in tears and make everything worth while . This book is beyond worth reading . I don't regret this at all .
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|When I first learned of a new Suede record on their website forum, I took a deep breath and I braced for the worst. Suede gave me two of the ten best albums of my lifetime in their debut and \\"Dog Man Star\\", but their most recent studio album (\\"A New Morning\\") was incredibly difficult to even sit all the way through - and let's face it... Bands getting back together and recording new material usually doesn't work.<br /><br />When the band's musical genius, Bernard Butler, left the band in a huff in 1994, fans and critics just assumed they were done for. In 1996, however, they released \\"Coming Up\\", a more accessible record featuring a very young Richard Oakes (Butler's replacement) and drummer Simon Gilbert's cousin, Neil Codling, as a new member. This record wasn't on the level of their first two Butler-penned albums, but there wasn't a significant drop-off in artistic quality and the fanbase rejoiced that they had some of the bands best tracks ever in \\"Beautiful Ones\\" and \\"Saturday Night\\".<br /><br />However, in the years that followed, Brett Anderson began to have personal issues and the quality of his writing, especially his lyrics, went downhill. There were a few standout gems in tracks like \\"She's In Fashion\\" and \\"Can't Get Enough\\", but his vocal was overly - and perhaps deliberately - nasal, and his lyrics were often recycled from his other songs (litter on the breeze, etc). By the time \\"A New Morning\\" was released, we could all see that the band had hit a wall. The album featured a single standout track in \\"Obsessions\\" but songs like \\"Positivity\\" and \\"Streetlife\\" were a far cry from the artistic quality found on \\"Dog Man Star\\" and were borderline embarrassing. I'm all for evolution and changing of styles, but this wasn't growth; it was a record by a band unraveling.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2011 and the band issued my favorite hits collection of all time in \\"The Best of Suede\\". Far better than their previous compilation \\"Singles\\", the two CD set showcased the band in their prime and illustrated why they were such a critical band in the 90's and to British Indie - a key reason that they were the primary influence of future bands like Bloc Party. They followed this Best of set with re-issues of their studio albums in Deluxe packages, bundling in each era's b-sides and demos.<br /><br />Twenty years after the release of the band's splendid debut and a decade since their last proper studio album, Suede give us \\"Bloodsports\\". The album's lead tasters \\"It Starts and Ends with You\\" and \\"Barriers\\" are fantastic stompers that could easily give songs like \\"Trash\\" a run for their money. The lyrics on \\"Barriers\\" prove that Brett Anderson has been reinvigorated and can still tell a story. If I'm being honest, I still cringed at a few lyrics like Sabotage's \\"her touch is like a Raven's shadow\\", but the backing music is so fantastic and fresh that you can look past these moments of weakness and praise the band for even being able to follow \\"A New Morning\\" with something this great.<br /><br />The highlight of this record, really, is the guitar playing. The inventiveness and the artistry really shines through on each and every song. It's so good that I was surprised to learn that Neil Codling had actually written a good portion of the album's music. Songs like the aforementioned \\"Sabotage\\", \\"Snowblind\\", \\"Hit Me\\", \\"For the Strangers\\" and \\"What Are You Not Telling Me\\" are all standouts and can hold up to the lead single \\"It Starts and Ends with You\\".<br /><br />I haven't had a Suede album since \\"Coming Up\\" that I could listen to all the way through without the desire to skip over tracks. (You didn't skip over \\"Elephant Man\\" ever? Come on...) More than that, it's the first album by ANY artist that I haven't skipped over tracks since BLOC PARTY's \\"Silent Alarm\\".<br /><br />One side note:  Track 8, \\"What Are You Not Telling Me\\", is mastered very, very loudly. It sounds harsh and out of tune and sometimes distorted. It's a shame because it's a great song.<br /><br />I won't bother using the phrase \\"a return to form\\", but the album is just so fantastic. It appears that we have thought the band were dead on multiple occasions now and they just keep charging back stronger. If you have the opportunity, grab \\"Dawn Chorus\\" - the best of the 4 non-LP tracks. Many will insist that \\"No Holding Back\\" is the best track because it's rare and they shelled out over a hundred pounds for a box set that offers this track exclusively, but it isn't nearly as memorable as \\"Dawn Chorus\\". Also, there have been grumblings by fans about the packaging and quality of the Super Deluxe Edition and the high price for that box set, but don't let that deter you from buying the best album of 2013.
B00433TO52|5.0|This was a fast, easy, accurate transaction! Very prompy delivery, and all at an exceptional price: better than all the rest.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the BEST game ever. It is a bit bad though because i had to completly shut down my kindle before i could play any of my maps and now the game doesent evem work! i have tryed 23 times to get to play my game and it is stuck in the cloud. i blame the minecraft people for that last part. it should be fixed by now.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love this app!  So many puzzles and at any level you need!  The only reason I gave only 4 stars is there is no way to change the back ground color which makes dark puzzles to difficult to see.
B000YDAYCW|4.0|The boots themselves are pretty nice. They look good and the quality isn't bad, especially for the price. The sizing however, is very hard to get right without trying them on. I ordered my first pair a half a size small than what I normally wear, and they were huge. So I returned for a whole size down, thinking that might do the trick, and they're still pretty roomy. I decided to keep these ones and just wear them with the extra room. In hindsight, I probably could've went down a whole two or two and a half sizes smaller than  what I normally wear. I've just never found a shoe that is that far off of actual sizing. Using 1 whole size max for some companies.<br /><br />From my experience with the two pairs I bought, order a size and a half smaller than your true foot size, maybe even size down two.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I am a film student so I have a deep love for movies, and this really hit a home run for me.  Not only was the production design and all of the art direction on point to really sell the era of the film but Daniel Day Lewis earned that Oscar with his performance.  I forgot I was watching a movie about Lincoln and was able to enjoy the story as a whole, from a different perspective learned in school.  A great historical watch, and beautifully shot in my opinion.
B0001WTWCO|3.0|I didn't quite understand or grasp the concept of this movie.The acting was fine I just didn't understand this movie
0439023491|3.0|Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins starts off right where the Hunger Games ends. Katniss and Peeta have just one the Hunger Games. Catching Fire was disappointing after reading The Hunger Games because The Hunger Games has so much more action and goes at a good pace. Catching Fire was going very slow and was not getting anywhere. The Hunger Games was full of action and the Catching Fire was a pause and then Mockingjay was back to action. Catching Fire and gave me less interest in reading Mockingjay. Catching Fire had a lot of hard core romance. I recommend this book even though it was very slow. It still had much meaning and is a good lesson for love. Teenagers from 13+ should read this book.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|GORGEOUS! Michael's silky smooth vocals combined with classic yet unique arrangements will actually replace some of your traditional holiday song renditions! &#34;White Christmas&#34; ~ I definitely prefer Michael's to Bing's now. Who'd have thought?<br /><br />The entire CD will bring you home to love & simpler times.

B0032CVAQQ|4.0|It was a good explanation of people's expectation and ideas of what love should be.  however, it did not hold my interest.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I am so in love with this movie, it's story and the characters.  The music is amazing.  I downloaded many of the lyrics.  Now, I can sing along with every word :) \\"Life is short babe, time is flying, I'm looking for baggage that goes with mine!\\"  There are no truer words. I must own the video; and I must own the soundtrack.  That's next.  My heart breaks for the people who are suffering.  And my heart leaps for the people who succeed.  I cry everytime, especially, if I'm singing.  It's moving and spirited, and uplifting.  Jonathan Larson - thank you.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie rates high with Us. My favorite is still the 10 Anniversary production, but WELL DONE.. We are particularly pleased because of the principal players - Hugh, Anne, Colm, et al.  (Not sure where the 25th Anniversary production and the sundry older movie versions stack up at this point, but happy as a 'pig in slop'.)
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Enjoyed the movie in theater, better to watch at home. Can pause at any time to get a snack or go back to review a previous section.

B005IQZB14|5.0|I could not stop reading this book.  An amazing book of the process of self discovery.  I usually read fiction, but her story was so compelling.  So glad I read it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|What a great book. I can hardly wait to read the rest of the books in this series. My only regret is that Larsson will not be writing more books.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|EL James gives a most gripping account of the emotions that accompany new. As a woman of similar age, I found the character's rationalization to be very much in keeping with her stage of development. There's no way to stay away from the next book after reading Fifty Shades of Grey.
0345803507|4.0|Of course it ends with a happy ending! I still have friends ask me for the book! Don't know if its good enough for a reread!
0316017930|5.0|Outliers is a great book. I loved how the information was presented for the various types of 'outlier' achievers and the analysis was handled by Gladwell. It all makes perfect sense, yet this critical review of the info and topics shared within the book to demonstrate why people become outliers is truly enjoyable (and that great success is achievable!). Personally, it helped me see trends in my own behavior and skills as an entrepreneur and the practicality of 'practice makes perfect.' Highly recommend reading it!

B0000C9V3T|5.0|I recieved my copy of the \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" Cd yesterday, and immediately socked it into the car stereo to listen to on my way to work... Well, I'll tell ya... From the opening notes of Nancy Sinatra's take on \\"Bang Bang\\" to the \\"Ironside Theme\\" exerpt, I was totally BLOWN AWAY by the sound quality and song selection.<br />  As a musician who records his own music, I'm fairly critical about the sound quality of the Cds I collect. Most of them come from the 60's \\"Psychedelic\\" era I grew up with and were transfered from old analog tape masters... Some sound better than others, and I give them quite a bit of leeway considering the available recording methods at that time. However, I expect a certain clarity from \\"Modern Era\\" digital recording methods in my 'newer' stuff...<br />  On the \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\", whoever did the sound levels and mixing, did a FANTASTIC job! I found myself bopping around in the drivers seat to the music as I drove to work. My favorite songs are:<br />  .\\"Run Fay Run\\" (Issac Hates)- The Song grabs you from the first note, and doesn't let go.<br />  .\\"Twisted Nerve\\" (Bernard Herrmann) - Spooky and deiicious!<br />  .\\"Woo Who\\" (The 5,6,7,8s) - Goofy as hell, and a cool drum solo that you can't hear very well in the film.<br />  .\\"The Lonely Shepherd\\" (James Last & Gheorghe Zamfir) - Builds and builds in layers of emotion.<br />  .\\"Green Hornet\\" (Al Hirt) - I defy anyone to listen to this without tapping your toes to it!<br />  I will be listening to this for a long time to come... Great production, Great music, Great song selection! One word of caution, though... Do not play the 'Queen of the Crime Council' dialog track in front of young children because it is EXTREMELY explicit!<br />  I highly recommend this Cd to soundtrack and music lovers alike! It's all KILLER, NO FILLER! Peace.

B00B3HJLX6|5.0|A great album full of under-rated classic rock songs, covered by a band consisting of world class musicians.<br /><br />Much credit has to be given to Russell Allan for his phenomenal vocals and modest interpretations of these songs.  Notable in this vein are songs like Heart's Barracuda, which Russell has an uncanny likeness of is own to Ann Wilson.<br /><br />Equally notable is Mike Orlando (guitars).  Though the metal world is full of shredders who know their way up and down the neck of a guitar, Orlando brings nuanced spirit into his guitar work.<br /><br />A great soundtrack to a road trip or a spring bbq!

B003PJ6UHA|3.0|If you count biocentrism, there are essentially three science based theologies that explain how consciousness, the triumphant crown of creation, came to be in a universe that began with absolutely nothing.  In fact, the odds against the creation of intelligent human beings is simply astronomical. Consider the physics of our universe:<br /><br />There are perhaps a hundred fundamental physical constants. These are things like the mass of a proton, the charge on an electron, the strength of the strong nuclear force, the fine structure constant, the speed of light in a vacuum and the gravitational constant.  For a complete list, Google \\"NIST fundamental physical constants index\\". There is NO physical reason why these universal constants should have the values that they do, and if conditions at the beginning of our universe were slightly different, the values of these constants would have been very different.  But it is a fact that if any one of them was different by as little as one part in a thousand life in this universe would not be possible.  Indeed, if some of them were even slightly different than the values we measure, matter would not exist at all.<br /><br />Or consider the odds against animal life ever developing on the nascent earth, or virtually any other planet (as outlined in Peter Ward's book: \\"Rare Earth\\").  Most stars in the universe are smaller than our sun, so the habitable zone surrounding them would be so close to the star that gravitational lock (One side perpetually facing the star) would guarantee that animal life would never have a chance to develop.  The large moon of earth, a very rare phenomenon,is the only thing keeping the poles from precessing through 90 degrees over the course of a few million years. That size precession would destroy developing animal life.  The planet Jupiter is in a circular orbit at the correct distance from the earth to protect it from life ending asteroid strikes, while the Jupiters surrounding all the other planets we have seen so far are in eccentric orbits (which would likely send earth-like planets hurtling off into space) or are too close to their suns to serve the same purpose as our own Jupiter. There are a whole slew of other reasons that animal life was fantastically lucky to develop on our earth!<br /><br />The three scientific theologies that currently explain these and other unlikely anthropic circumstances of our existence are scientific cosmology, intelligent design, and biocentrism.<br /><br />Make no mistake.  Modern cosmology IS a theology. It may be based on scientific observations, but it is no more provable than the thesis of God!.  The current scientific theology suggests that the universe did explode into existence from nothing.  It explains the fine tuning of the cosmological constants by postulating a \\"multiverse\\".  \\"M-theory\\" (as explained by Stephen Hawking) requires ten to the 500th power, (a fantastic number) of universes.  It needs a nearly infinite supply of universes so that all combinations and values of cosmological constants can be \\"tried out\\", as well as all the one-off circumstances that allowed the creation of animal life and ultimately consciousness.  Most of these universes would never even allow the formation of matter, or, if they did, would ultimately be sterile.  But if you get that many tries, chance should produce at least one human bearing earth!<br /><br />The second scientific theology in the running to explain how we came about is \\"intelligent design\\".  Intelligent design IS based on science and is NOT the same thing as creationism or creation science.  It involves itself with the statistical analysis of biological and physical data and is a major thorn in the side of the scientific reductionists who try to justify scientific cosmology and evolution science.  Biologists had to admit that while Darwin was right about common ancestry and natural selection, the third leg of his theory, random mutation, does not explain how life started in the first place. Intelligent design simply argues that in order for such an improbable species as Man to have evolved on such an improbable planet in such an improbable universe, there must be an intelligence behind his creation. If this argument seems unlikely because of its simplicity (or, if you will, naivety), in comparison with the scientific cosmological theory invoking a nearly infinite number of sterile universes in order to produce the one in which we live, Intelligent design acquits itself quite well.<br /><br />Biocentrism is quite different from scientific cosmology or intelligent design in that it does not postulate a scenario for creation, or any form of history for that matter.  It is based upon the discovery that consciousness is an intrinsic property of reality.  The roll of consciousness in the production of the real world is part of the theory of quantum mechanics refined by such luminaries as Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg (much to the horror of Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrodinger).  Biocentrism argues that nothing exists until and unless it is observed by a conscious observer.  When a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, according to biocentrism, it does NOT make a noise.  In fact, the tree and its noise are really just waves of probability  existing in an undefined state, and do not become actual trees or noise until they are observed by a conscious observer.<br /><br />In order to show how this is so, the author expends considerable time explaining the famous double slit experiment in which electrons can produce either an interference pattern (wave-like property) or a bell curve pattern (particle-like property) depending on how the experiment is set up.  In short, electrons and other subatomic particles exist as probability waves until the wave is collapsed by a conscious observer.  He goes on to explain the improbability of the anthropic values of the universal constants, and time as an illusion.  Essentiallyhe says that the only reason that the universe contains its anthropic coincidences is that living observers looked at it and collapsed the wave forms to create the universe in the only way that it could be created if living observers were there to look at it in the first place.  In other words, life creates the universe, and not the other way around.<br /><br />Regardless of what you think of the biocentrism hypothesis, the author's science is superficial, and he is not very convincing.  His arguments are in accordance with quantum physics, but they don't fit in with ordinary reality and he fails to give the reader any reason to accept them in lieu of ordinary reality.  Without some sort of evidence, it is hard to take biocentrism seriously.  Another criticism is that he inserts himself and his family into the book in various places to no useful effect.  He is a physician.  You are very aware that he doesn't seem to care much for his mother or father, and feels that his sister was badly served by his family.  He describes his rather large estate in Clinton Massachusetts well enough that you can find it on Google Earth.<br /><br />On the plus side, he does describe biocentrism well enough to get the point across. Furthermore, biocentrism has a validity rooted in quantum physics.  Originally, the standard model predicted that the quarks that make up hadrons (protons and neutrons) would have no mass.  In order to give them mass, the theorists had to invent the Higgs field.  With the recent confirmation that the Higgs boson does exist, it appears that mass is not an intrinsic property of matter, but is instead constructed entirely from the energy of the interactions between massless elementary partials, and their quantum fields.<br /><br />The question the reader must ask himself is, \\"Is reality real?\\".  And if, in fact,it isn't, and consciousness creates the reality we live in, perhaps there are other realities created by other intelligences.  And maybe God has a place to live after all.

B005S9EKCW|4.0|I must have seen Les Miz live about 20 times so I was interested to catch up on the movie given all the hype. I also know at least a dozen musical nerds who love the stage version but their opinions were even divided on the film. I saw it and really enjoyed the whole thing much to the shock of my nerd friends who had the following issues.<br /><br />If you're a staunch fan of the live musical, you're not going to be happy about the abridgements made in some of the most popular songs. Additionally, there are deviations from the stage version that are apparently more faithful to the original novel but potentially a little unnerving. If you're a 'light fan' you may not even notice these changes and may frankly thank them for keeping the length manageable.<br /><br />I was personally blown away by Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman in both their singing and performance - clearly stand out, Oscar-winning performances if ever they were any. Nerds were not convinced that these were the best Fantine and Valjean compared to the London and New York stage versions to which I shake my head in disbelief. Seriously, both actors give everything to their parts here and carry the 'emotional necessity' of the roles perfectly. Actually, a big thumbs up to the make up for both characters too - they look truly beaten down.<br /><br />I'd heard that Russell Crowe was a disaster and he was - partly because the other singers are in a different league. Since the entire film was performed live to camera (rather than recorded and lip-sync'd), he clearly struggles and there's no post production on the sound to hide it. But the big shocker is Amanda Seyfried who sings her little heart out in Mamma Mia but crashes and burns with a warbly, kind-of-operatic Cosette.<br /><br />On a technical note, although the sets were excellent, the connecting CGI was dreadful - watching the opening scene with 50 real people in real water tugging a large fake boat wasn't a great way to open. It's a shame since the rest of the scene was really great. Additionally, the camerawork is fairly sloppy throughout - the actors were allowed perform without hitting marks so occasionally the camera operators go out of their way to get them back in the frame and the focus puller is working overtime. Similarly, this causes problems with the lighting so some of the singing scenes are very dark as the camera catches up with the actor.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good adaptation with a couple of flaws but nevertheless was better than most films in 2012. It's easily accessible to those who haven't seen it before all the way up the musical groupies who critique every line of dialog.est of the scene was really great.

B004N66XYE|5.0|Once I began watching it I could not stop until I had watched the entire season in one sitting. The characters are so engaging and the plot realistic. I found myself wanting to know what would happen next so I have ordered the second season. I am only sad that the third season was canceled. If you are a fan of Downton Abbey, you will love this remake of an old classic aired on Master Piece Theatre back in the 70s.

B003BW0CB6|5.0|great,  loved how characters from Harry Bosch novels were cross referenced in this story.  will continue to read other Mickey Haller stories
0525952926|1.0|This sequel is superfluous. The good guys are sickeningly good, the bad guys unbelievably bad. This doesnt really help in developing the characters, there is not one you can identify with or even like. And that makes it boring. All the same, one of them is always present at historical events, and they keep on meeting in the most improbable of circumstances. Like when one of the characters is trying to blow up a German train in France together with the Resistance, and a British plane attacking the train is shot down, only to reveal that the pilot is his half-brother, who then dies in his arms. I'm sorry, you just lost me there Ken. Its all just a little too much. The best thing about it was when I finally finished it and could delete it from my Kindle. I'll refrain from reading part three.

1881273377|2.0|I bought this CD after watching the author on the Oprah show.  My husband and I took the survey,which I had downloaded .  We thought the survey gave us helpful insight about our relationship.  I think it made us a bit more patient and considerate.<br />My single daughter told me that some of her friends had used the book in premarital counseling, so I thought my married daughter and her husband might benefit from the CD. ( I opted for the CD, because I doubted they would read any book recommened by me.)<br />  When the CD arrived I listened to it and was appalled by it's naivete.  The situations were  simplistic and the couples were one dimensional. It seemed preachy.  It's a good thing I didn't give the CD to my married daughter before I listened to it.

B005S9EKCW|2.0|Ok first of I have to admit to being a huge fan of the stage show, having seen it over 10 times I rate it as the best show I have ever seen on the stage. However the movie was very disappointing, I understand the need for star names to sell seats, and to film it in as big a way as possible. The technique of having them sing all the songs live should have been perfect. No doubt Hugh Jackman can sing having been on the stage in his younger years, and he does an ok job here, not great but good enough. Russell Crowe has a good voice but nowhere near strong enough for Javert and the two standout songs his part calls for are very disappointing. Anne Hathaway may be a good actress but she absolutely ruins the songs she sings, and appears to try to act her way through the songs rather than just sing them. Amanda Seyfried is a talented singer, but she appears to have forgotten how to sing in this film. The only one who appears to know that this is a musical and the songs actually need to be sung is Samantha Barks who is outstanding as Eponine, not surprising as she has been playing the same part on the stage. Also they switched the order of several songs for some unknown reason. Overall this was a disaster and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the storyline is great, the views are really well shot and some of the music still stands out despite the attempts of the actors to ruin the songs.

1594203334|5.0|This is my first time reviewing a product on here. I am only doing so because it is not an exaggeration to say that this book changed my life and my whole outlook on parenting. A stay-at-home mom who left a career to raise her baby girl, I have been struggling for months with the idea of being the perfect mother. I read a billion books, researched a ton, and almost literally drown in all of the extreme expectations that American mothers often have for themselves. \\"Breast-feed or you don't love your baby. Buy organic produce and puree all of babies food. Teach sign language. Teach spanish. God-forbid you ever let baby watch tv. Stimulate your baby constantly. Cry-it-out is such abuse. You are a lazy parent.\\" I mean, seriously people. MAKE IT STOP, is all I wanted to do. This book gave me pause. Wait.... you mean I don't have to doubt myself and worry constantly? Wait, it is healthy for my baby if I have a life outside of her? And the best of all... I might actually affect her negatively if I continue to parent her so over-zealously? By chapter 3, I was already being a bit kinder to myself. This is a MUST READ for parents. I will be buying it for every shower I attend. Did I mention that she's funny too?<br /><br />Thank you, Pamela. Thank you for giving me my sanity back.

Some may be confused and not realize that these are different storylines with different characters and settings.<br /><br />'Asylum' takes place mostly in 1962-1965 and features the horrors of the barbaric mental institutions of the earlier 20th century and dark personalities. Briarcliff Manor is run under Sister Jude's thumb (Jessica Lange); a hard-ass nun that may don a habit but is an ungodly woman. Her assistant Sister Mary Eunice McKee (Lily Rabe) is a nervous pleaser who quickly becomes the nun from Hell. Evan Peters returns as a simple husband, Kit Walker who at this dark time in this countries history was married secretly to an African American, Alma (Britne Oldford) who gets framed for a series of brutal murders reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs and Texas Chainsaw Massacre (original version) badboys Norman Bates and Leatherface.<br /><br />Sarah Paulson truly shines in this season as Lana Winters, a devoted reporter whose life becomes quickly becomes a truly terrifying tale of survival. Zachary Quinto returns as Dr. Oliver Thredson, a psychiatrist with more than meets the eye while Joeseph Fiennes and James Cromwell; respectively Reverend and Monsinger Timothy Howard and the crooked Dr. Arthur Arden.<br /><br />There's plenty of craziness to go around, I never found a dull moment. I felt this was an enticing, alluring, even darker, creepier and suspenseful than the previous chapter retroactively titled \\"Murder House\\".<br /><br />A lot of viewers have complaints over what they believe to be unresolved plots, however Asylum raps everything up, some maybe abruptly, but there's a beginning and an end to everyone's madness.<br /><br />TV-MA LSV<br /><br />There is frequent graphic, bloody violence, disturbing images, frightening and intense scenes and stronger language and sexual content than before.<br /><br />Suggested Rating: 17+ for Strong grizzly violence, pervasive disturbing content and images, language and sexual content including nudity.ere is frequent graphic, bloody violence, disturbing images, frightening and intense scenes and stronger language and sexual content than before.<br /><br />Suggested Rating: 17+ for Strong grizzly violence, pervasive disturbing content and images, language and sexual content including nudity.

As You probably know, the Black Dahlia murder is the most gruesome unsolved crime in the history of the USA.<br /><br />I could tell before the opening credits started that this was something I was interested in. As creator Ryan Murphy says, this seasons focus was about infidelity. It did have a great dark suburban tone like Twin Peaks despite it taking place in Los Angeles.<br /><br />I found all the cast to be great, Taissa Farmiga will be great to watch out for. She excelled as the brutally conflicted teenager Violet Harmon, whose mother, Connie Britton as Vivian Harmon is living the American Dream become nightmare whose husband Ben played by Dylan McDermott as a psychiatrist with plenty of his own issues.<br /><br />Other new talents I enjoyed were Lily Rabe as Nora Montgomery; a socialite married to a prominent doctor with some huge demons and Evan Peters as Tate Langdon, the son of Constance Langdon played perfectly by Jessica Lange. A southern belle that believes in old fashioned manners and her own form of justice which makes her the most terrifying neighbor since the Young family in Desperate Housewives.<br /><br />The mini-series is a very well-written, refreshingly original take to the 'haunted house'. Once you finish the first 10 episodes and you understand everything, it's a real mind warp that is disturbingly profound and profoundly disturbing.<br /><br />TV-MA LSV<br /><br />My rating: 16+<br /><br />American Horror Story is essentially as violent as a horror movie would be. In this season the violence is pretty graphic and can be disturbing to younger or more sensitive viewers. There are many 'scary moments', frequent mild profanities, a scene of drug use and many scenes that would disturb people. Episode 6 is I think by far the most graphic and disturbing episode, but I think a 16 year old can handle it.<br /><br />Suggested rating; 16+ for strong violence and gore, disturbing images, language and sexual content including brief nudity.nd can be disturbing to younger or more sensitive viewers.

B000059ZLH|4.0|First of all, I have every DT audio release and several DVDs, and love them all. But this video leaves a lot to be desired. It does not include the entire concert performance, just the Metropolis 2000 performance. I was rather disappointed, especially when the part of the concert covered by the 3rd cd in the audio release is added as \\"additional bonus material.\\" Also, some of the video production looks like something that Iron Butterfly would have produced in 1968, with the terrible over-the-top graphics and multi-screen shots of each of the band members. Some of the screen shots were actually upside-down. I personally did not care for the imbedded videos of the characters of the story.<br />That being said, great concert, great musical performance (only a few off-pitch notes), and I love the story. I still prefer Score and Budokan.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Awesome story, didn't want to put it down. Loved it!  Adding more Gillian Flynn titles to my wish list now.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not every ending should be all perfect and happy and roses all around but this book was awesome with a floppy ending. I wish Amy was caught out because much of it was unrealistic as far as her explanations when she came back. There were many people who could testify about her past and sociopath-like behavior
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Needed a video to keep me awake during my travels. Downloaded the first couple of episodes to get a feel for the story line. Nothing better than an action packed story that flows well. Ended up downloading the majority of the 1st seasons episodes. Eventually as time allows I will download the remainder of the episodes to my Kindle Fire and enjoy.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|This book was ok. I really liked the plot and I loved Julian. His character really jumped out yo me as likable. But the ending was pretty disappointing. It just ends. It didn't help me at all figure out what happens at the end. I was pretty disappointed sorry.
B00BMUYLSE|4.0|With now over 100 reviews on this album I don't think I can add much more accept this. Bowie has always had the talent to change his music to the modern trend and that's exactly what he does here. All of the songs are Alternative rock and Pop. Dont get me wrong this isn't a bad thing, but Bowie has always been glam rock and 60's pop, so to say. This album has great songs but only 1 or 2 might stand out, to me they are: The stars (are out tonight), and Love is lost. In this case, change is good, once you get passed that fact you can very well enjoy this album. 4/5 stars.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I Plan to read all 3 -  I am reading 2nd one now .I  have nothing else to say about it

B000AY74OG|5.0|I purchased this movie to complete my 14 month old daughters Madagascar collection and she loves this, as she does anything and everything Madagascar.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|That is the only description you need to read this book. I would have let him in my bedroom window any t one! Great, sad, moving story. The story is really the greatest part of this book but Holder is the cherry on top for sure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is way better than  the game temple run or temple run 2. I would give this five star rating.
0061928356|5.0|As someone familiar with Indian culture and aware that in remote villages the practice of female infanticide exists, this book was an exceptional read.  I couldn't put it down and loved her style and use of prose.  She transferred back and forth between the characters without losing me, the reader.<br /><br />This is the first book I have read by this author and know she is now on my favored list. Worth the read!
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Oscar Wilde has simply brought to life the many actions that one man will go to in order to keep his youth and his sanity. You learn why such conspiracies were not meant to go against the beauty and power of the arts.
0307278255|5.0|Wish the stories were longer... I loved reading them so much and went through the book very quickly.<br /><br />Her language and style is riveting and as an avid reader I have read all her books.  I always look forward to reading her books.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Game is fun to play and great for short periods of time.  Can't wait to earn more coins so I can customize my ride :)
B005NPCUC8|3.0|Yes I realize this is acclaimed as one of the greatest rock albums. When I hear Pink Floyd now, I wonder why. Their music just comes across as boring. I'm now 50, don't smoke anything. 30 years ago this band had more appeal to me. On sale at $2.99 I'm tempted to buy it. Perhaps driving across a deserted Nevada road at night in my convertible the music may have some appeal.
B005LAII0S|4.0|I had rented the movie first and loved it so I bought it so I could watch when ever I wanted. I love the song at the end.

B0042X9L6A|5.0|Great flash. Would definitely recommend, however we are talking about Nikon. Also lasts a long time on a full charge.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|It was a good book with lots of twists and unexpected turns.  At the end I still wasn't sure what was truth and what was fantasy.  I like Dennis J.Lehane's style of thrillers and this one you really have to pay attention to or you won't know which way is up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is not even in a subway but addicting ausome game fun it is really fun fun fun. Get it please

B000ICXQHE|5.0|Love the action and the plot - very good stuff - funny *and* dramatic - with a great plot twist I can't hint at without a spoiler. If you like mysteries - this is for you.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book trilogy is what got me started  reading. Before I picked up this trilogy I hated reading. A few friends of mine told me to read this trilogy and so I did. Once I started reading it ,I could not put it down. It has opened my mind to the world of reading and now I love to read. I tell everyone I know to read these books. Once you pick them up you will not stop until you are on the last page of the thrift book. It is amazing....you will love it.
B00AMS38YU|3.0|&#34;Premium Rush&#34; has all the makings of the fun, thrill-ride kind of movie, but it just didn't come together for me. I was hoping for more than just 90 minutes of eye candy, but that's pretty much all I got. Still -- I can't say I was unhappy watching JGL bike around New York.
B008JFUNPK|4.0|\\"The Croods\\" is one of those rare family films that is actually about a family.  Like so many of these animated flicks, the plot is supposedly about slapstick humor but is actually about the erosion of father figure Grug's (Nicolas Cage) authority as leader of the family unit.  Throw in a burgeoning romance between his eldest daughter Eep (Emma Stone) with stranger Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and you have...well you have the exact same plot of \\"Hotel Transylvania.\\" Only better.<br /><br />In the world of the Neanderthal, the Croods have to work hard to stay alive, a fact the film never shies away from.  A thrilling hunt sequence concludes with barely enough food to feed wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), baby Sandy (Randy Thom), son Thunk (Clark Duke) and arch-nemesis/mother-in-law Gran (Cloris Leachman). Their brutal world involves spending most of the day hunting for eggs in the desert, and then cowering in a heap in a cave at night. In case it's not clear, \\"The Croods\\" demonstrates that Grug's over-protectiveness is well-earned by throwing, get this, a bearowl at the family over and over.  This is probably the closest gamers are ever going to see the Dungeons & Dragons equivalent of an owlbear on screen.<br /><br />The true threat turns out to be both physical and existential: first in the inevitable separation of Pangea and then the arrival of a boy.  That boy happens to be homo sapien Guy and his pet sloth, Belt (Chris Sanders).  Guy has lots of interesting ideas like fire, puppets, and an apocalyptic vision that piques cute redhead Neanderthal Eep's interest in him.  You can guess where this is going, right?<br /><br />When the apocalypse destroys the cavemen's cave, the family is forced into a land lush with vegetation, animals, food - and predators.  Lots and lots of predators. Where and when the Croods live is undefined, but it's a lot like \\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\\" in that fauna is a mix of two or more animals: mousephants, piranhakeets, liyotes, jackrobats...you get the idea.  Grug discovers that his usual fight or flight tactics are not enough in this strange new world.  It will require flexibility, courage, and no small amount of imagination to reach their new home.<br /><br />Along the way, \\"The Croods\\" isn't afraid to make fun of family dynamics. Grug routinely trains Thunk to take the lead in the hunt even though it's obvious Eep is the superior of just about every character on screen, including the physically weaker object of her affection, Guy.  Much of Grug's motivation is determined by the possibility that elderly Gran will finally kick the bucket. And Eep must learn how to separate herself from her family without losing her identity.  It's heavy stuff for a kid's film.<br /><br />Most of the time the film rumbles along at a breakneck pace, careening from natural disasters to bizarre animals and back again.  But then there's a lot of talk about feelings, Grug threatens Guy, and Guy comes up with a solution involving genre-stretching puppets.  This happens not once, but twice, and during those talky moments my son fidgeted in his seat.<br /><br />But then more explosions happen, the family rallies, and Belt shouts his trademark, \\"Dun, dun, DUNNNN!\\" Kids were repeating it in the audience, so mission accomplished.  Although it's not always a smooth ride, any film where the female protagonist is smarter, stronger, and more creative than her male counterparts is a great evolutionary step forward.t the idea.

B0089AD8IO|5.0|This was my introduction to &#34;Doctor Who&#34; and, as such, I'll always be loyal to Nine and Rose. I love Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper -- not to mention John Barrowman as the sexy Captain Jack -- they make this season a lot of fun. Even though there's not a lot of episodes, there are a ton of extras  (narrated by Simon Pegg), so that makes the DVD worth it.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I saw this in the movies when it came out and immediatly ordered the DVD. Final price was less than the price at the point of order. Can't beat that!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|We love Game of Thrones. We are so excited for season 3 to start on March 31st. The only thing I don't like about this product is the fact that you have to search for the deleted scenes.

1476719071|5.0|**4.5 stars**<br /><br />Let me just start by saying that I was extremely nervous to read Beautiful Disaster. I have owned this book for nearly a year now, but just hadn't taken the leap. I will admit, I let all the negativity surrounding the book to scare me off. I can't say why, maybe it was due to the intensity of the feelings that had me freaked out. But it finally came down to me being practically the last of my friends to jump in, and I hate being left out, guys.<br /><br />So what did I think?<br /><br />I thought Beautiful Disaster was pretty great. There is a certain aspect to the story, and McGuire's writing, that made the book near impossible to put down. I truly enjoyed the story, but have to say the characters are what makes this book shine. I adored Travis and Abby's friends, Shep and America. Their commentary on and reactions to the insanity that is Travis and Abby was hilarious and direct. I found Abby to be a really likeable character. Did I agree with everything she said and did? No, but honestly, I'm sort of tired of the perfection that is expected of characters. Trust me, if I went away to college at eighteen years old, lived in the dorms with no one to hold me accountable, and had the exceedingly sexy Travis Maddox after me... you better believe that I would have been making \\"stupid\\" decisions, too!<br /><br />Travis Maddox. The man is worshipped by some readers and absolutely hated by others. He's abrupt, impulsive, intense, has a wicked temper, and is more than a tad possessive. And though I wanted him to calm down and chill for a beat, I didn't hate him in the slightest. Listen, I am sort of known (and mercilessly teased by my husband) for my own temper problems when I was Travis' age. Now don't get me wrong, I've never been in a fight in my life, but let's just say that I know what it's like to be out of control. Travis is passionate to a fault. And this isn't me making excuses for his bad behavior. This is me saying that sometimes people mess up. They do things they shouldn't and say thing the absolute wrong things. It's just a fact. Now, do I want my character to be held accountable for their bad behavior and learn from that? Absolutely. And Travis does.<br />Okay, sermon over. lol I know that Beautiful Disaster is not for everyone. Just like all books aren't for everyone. But you know what? Beautiful Disaster was for me, and I'm so happy I finally gave it a chance.ss up. They do things they shouldn't and say thing the absolute wrong things. It's just a fact.

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Excellent game, perhaps a tad short at times, but very fun and the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. Well worth the cost.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Reminiscent of the superb &#34;Anne of Green Gables&#34; television series (directed by Kevin Sullivan).  Extraordinary production values:  rich, lush cinematography, scenes.  Most highly recommended.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Tried this on Android device recently and must say it works seamlessly and quick navigation. It even works well on Rooted devices which is what i needed. Rest assured, this app is a must have on every Android's devices. Forget other commercial/free file managers. Just stick with this and you won't be disappointed.
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|This was a very great value for what it cost. The special effects were great, but I wasn't really a fan of the movie itself.
B008YJFF2M|5.0|Excellent collection. If you want the original Bond hits then search no further. Great Bargain!  Well worth the money. Five stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is totally the best game ever!! It is great for long car trips! It is also really addictive!!! I play it 24/7!!! It's a super fun for girls and boys!!!

B00AREIAI8|4.0|its cool fun and the horses are super super cute and the snacks are really cool and the unicorn is awsome
030758836X|4.0|Gillian Flynn creates a fast-paced, enthralling read - part whodunit, part psychological horror - that thrills with movie-ready plot development. Though the writing isn't the best of the best, Flynn's descriptive language has a few real winning moments like the following:<br /><br />\\"So you suffer through the night with the perfect-on-paper man - the stutter of jokes misunderstood, the witty remarks lobbed and missed. Or maybe he understands that you've made a witty remark but, unsure of what to do with it, he holds it in his hand like some bit of conversational phlegm he will wipe away later.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ironic people always dissolve when confronted with earnestness, it's their kryptonite.\\"<br /><br />\\"[T]hat baggy, exhausted, disappointed look that people get in middle age.\\"<br /><br />\\"My thank-yous always come out rather labored. I often don't give them at all. People do what they're supposed to do and then wait for you to pile on the appreciation - they're like frozen-yogurt employees who put out cups for tips.\\"
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app because of all the things that it reports to you. I rely on it a lot when I am away from a charging source.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love Temple Run 2 because I love the vines. I feel like it is a completely different game when I am playing it. I hallways forget about the first one when I play it. I think that temple run 2 is one of my favorote game! I can not wait to play again. Go temple Run 2!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great gripping novel.  I could actually see the movie playing in my head as I read the novel.  Well written and very compelling characters.  I certainly hope there is more to come from the world of silos.
B005KELW26|5.0|I love this cover because of the color, which is a middle color purple...it's light weight, yet still protects your Kindle Fire.  And it's easy to put on.
B004XZR63M|5.0|While I liked his real estate strategy, I thought his mindset was brilliant! You will be hooked by the end of the first chapter! Apply his mind set and you will be set for life.

B007ZGBZHE|3.0|This was my first Pendergast book and I found myself confused at times because I didn't know the backstory from previous books. I enjoy reading these authors works and was able to put some of the pieces together but it was challenging.
B00005JPLW|5.0|the movie looks great and its one of many that have brought my attention and its and amazing movie .
B007MCTTHY|2.0|I would not recommend this app for a Kindle Fire (2nd gen). My daughter played 2 levels and then my Kindle froze. I rebooted it, she tried to play it again and the same thing happened. I removed it within 24 hours of downloading it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, especially if you have down time. It's fun trying to find as many matching diamonds with in a minute. I have it on my phone too, but it freezes up, where on the Kindle it doesn't.

0375869026|5.0|Summary:<br /><br />August is a boy who was born with facial deformity that prevented him from going to school until the age of ten. August wants to be a normal kid, but Via...his sister and his parents protect him a little too much. August will attend his very first year of school at Beecher Prep.

B0042YHC38|1.0|I am a rather big guy.  I don't consider myself a body builder of any sort, but I can barely get my arm in this thing.  and when I add my iphone, it squeezes the heck out of it.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|It is a fun and at times challenging game. the good thing is,  if you get stuck there are hints you can use. Unlike some games that leave you hanging. Enjoy!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Jeremy Renner does a great job with this role. The story itself is action packed and the chemistry between Renner and Rachel Weisz added an element I think the other Bourne movies lacked. I'm a fan of the whole series and I think this installment had just enough to connect it to the series, yet was good enough to stand on its own.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Not your ordinary movie. Thought provoking and beautifully made. Great story line! Leaves you thinking long after the movie is over. Excellent acting and CG. Just see it!

B00A8ECU24|5.0|My kids love this game, important for parents to set time limits on games for children. Good game overall, nothing in content questionable.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I heard about this book after his murder and wanted to read about the man who WASN'T in the news.  He tells his story with grace, intelligence, tact and humor.  I could not put this book down.  He was an amazing person and this country has truly lost a wonderful husband and father.  May God bless his wife, children, and family.  Thank you for your service and your sacrifice, and for sharing an incredibly personal part of your life with all of us.  May God bless you and your family.
B000066744|5.0|This movie came as a great surprise.  The story was legendary/folkloric in nature, showed the vulnerability of human nature, love and fear & the piano music was greatly entertaining.  The excitement of enjoying this movie continued long afterwards in conversation.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A great little app, it is simple, but an essential tool for my Kindle fire HD. I use it every day for my calorie count and I love the memory feature.

B0091REZMW|4.0|It is an extremely simple setup which allows for infinite variation. Small steps and delicate moves means you learn how to play very quickly but can keep playing without getting bored for a very long time.

B00BKTFABE|1.0|I've had this app for 3 days now and have yet to be able to take a picture. Don't waste your dollar on this one.
B0074MZSWW|3.0|Love the music this band puts out. However, they should re-record the sessions done on this disk. Hold On, has a very irritating feedback buzz in the last part of the song. They may have been going for a certain type of \\"sound\\" on some of the other tracks, but this recording does not do the band, and especially Brittany's vocals any justice!<br /><br />Too bad they allowed this to be released sounding this way. Hopefully in the near future they will be able to correct this.<br /><br />The only reason it got 3 stars instead of one is because the music here is strong enough on it's own to look past the crappy production.<br /><br />Other than that this band has a great future ahead of them.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a fun app for for any age.  my child is hooked and now it looks like I am as well.
B00AO2TREY|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this album. The songs are so addictive, so meaningful, and just perfect! With the insanely catchy beats and amazing lyrics and tunes, there is honestly not a single song in this album that I don't like. Not to mention several of them have become my all time favorite songs. What I don't get is how none of these are getting played on the radio! So much better then everything that's in the mainstream right now. If they got some more publicity, I know they'd be massively climbing the charts with some of these songs, like \\"Miracle\\" and \\"Sandman\\" especially. If you're thinking about buying this album, don't consider it any longer. Buy it, listen to it, love it, share it. You won't regret it!
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I read this book because I wanted to compare it to today's vampire novels and films. I must admit that it is a classic for a reason. The skillful use of language and the way the story line pulls the read in is evident from the very beginning. I have not read the Twilight Saga books and do not consider myself a 'fan' of vampire, zombie or sci-fi. But this novel was well-written and very enjoyable. If you appreciate classic literature, whether it's David Copperfield, Jane Austen, or Mark Twain, you'll may enjoy this novel as well.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a very addictive game.  I used the hint often to get from place to place and I didn't want to be wandering around through all the areas; town, woods, garage, churchyard, ecetera, forever, without getting anywhere. When I kept trying to figure it out myself I was constantly going to the wrong places.  The game is quite intriguing.  I recommend it highly for anyone who loves hidden object games.  I solved the mystery of the game but will play it again to see if I can do it on my own without using the hints.
B003QSMC18|4.0|Cute show. The voo-doo was a bit much for the younger kids, but over all we enjoyed it. Kids 18 months to age 8 (plus adults) watched.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|To be upfront, there's some lackluster songs on this album. But the songs that are good are great and worth the price of admission alone. Also, if you have a chance to see this band live, don't pass it up; one of the best concerts I've been to in a good while.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I ripped through these books so fast and couldn't wait to see the movie.<br />great books, and not just for teens!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|it is awesome!!!!!!!!!!! every thing is great about it the graphas the gameing expierence you will love it tottaly worth it
B005WUHAX8|4.0|they are pretty great cases, but aren't indestructible.. for example my daughter sat on an empty case and broke it.  make sure you have an original charging cord for your phone or it won't fit in the case slot.  When my son's case was faulty, they sent him a new one, on two different occasions.  save your receipt.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|The special effects are out of this world! It is one of the most fantabulous movies out there! I would recommend watching and/or buying the DVD.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|All my record purchases from Amazon have the same rating.  I live in a town that doesn't have much shopping choices other than a mall.  With Amazon I get what what I want with a day or two of ordering.  It's more than wonderful! Thank you, thank you for your excellent service!!!
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|It's hard to find presents that will continue to be used months or years later.  But this Nerf N-Strike is still a favorite of the neighborhood's frequent nerf-gun wars.  Indeed, its usually one of the first ones selected.  It has rapid fire capacity and a decent range for any average-sized cul-de-sac.  Just be sure to stock up on extra nerf bullets.
B00AZKCU7G|1.0|Extremely disappointing that there wasn't a director's commentary (made all the worse given that Doris Kearns Goodwin would have been a perfect co-commentator).  I bought the four disc blu ray version and by and large the bonus materials are simply a collection of moments where actors, production staff, etc., all slap themselves on their backs to tell us what a great job they did.<br /><br />Instead of a historical treatment commentary, all we are left with is bonus fluff that completely wastes Ms. Goodwin who we see tramping around various sets with one line comments here and there.  Again, what a waste.  Just buy the regular version and a copy of Ms. Goodwin's 'Team of Rivals'.  The movie is terrific but Spielberg and his producers short-changed us all on the largely lame bonuses.  There are so many opportunities that were lost.  A history major myself, I had forgotten about Mary Lincoln's modiste whose back story as a slave and then a White House confidant only merited seconds of screen time.  And on and on.<br /><br />Updated: One afterthought on the movie is that without any commentary or bonus feature, Frederick Douglas and other African American anti-slavery advocates go unheard and Douglas especially was influential in appealing to Lincoln to change his thinking and put an end to slavery.  Hollywood is replete with movies where the \\"white man\\" saves the \\"black man\\" and this movie is on that same slippery slope by not including Douglas.  The path to the end of slavery like the path to Civil Rights in the 1960s was more than simply white benevolence and Spielberg would have made an even better movie had he included the importance of Douglas and others in changing the hearts and minds of Americans north and south alike.
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|I must say, when I first heard this record I was disappointed. Its not a typical Tegan and Sara CD or music. But it grows on you, and I love it! Its very 80's! It reminds me of all the greats in the 80's. Tegan and Sara are one of my favorite bands, and They never disappoint. I completely recommend this CD
B0067R0APK|5.0|I  have been using the free version for a while and love it.  I read the review that said the paid version is a lower version (the review is a year old) and checked them both out.  They are both 3.2.1.0 now (March 2013)<br />I have purchaced the paid (99cents) to get rid of the ads.<br />As far as the program goes, I find it easier to use than the weather channel one, and it has a 25 day forcast, weather channel's is only 10 days.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|a delight to read. Not that I am a fantasy type reader, yet based on the reviews I gave it a shot, and was not disappointed.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Really enjoyed this book..maybe even more than the first! Loved how Ridley and Link's relationship developed, as well as Lena and Ethan.Lots of action..great ending!
B001BANK32|5.0|haven't finished this book yet(already know how it ends, but still), but so far am loving it! Stephen King is a great writer!
1607066017|5.0|These other reviews have covered Saga spectacularly.<br />So I will just say that I am in love with the characters, story, artwork and am dying for more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|am currently working on book two. Let's get this straight people. We need to take this book for what it is, erotic twilight fanfiction. If you go into this book with that mindset, you won't be disappointed. If you go into it thinking this is one fantastic piece of literature, you MAY be disappointed.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is awesome and has the convenience of a timer to conserve battery power!! I use this daily to help control my insomnia I definitely recommend this to all people who struggle with sleep issues and all ages as well!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a very good game for girls or even boys that love horses or want a horse very badly or even already have a horse.
0689835604|1.0|I read this book to my 10 month-old puppy and every time we get to the belly button I can't help but notice the look of shame on his face. His belly button is covered in hair, unlike the nice hairless human belly buttons depicted in the pictures. He is very emotionally sensitive at this age and I don't think this book is good for his body image. It may give him psychological problems later in life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|a fun mobile. app to play everyday.so continue with subway surfers . it isawesome. so have a great. time. playing
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As this book evolves one is drawn into the electric suspense of survival. It reveals the variety of personalities and envisions the way people respond when cast into situations where only their brains, skills and cunning keep them alive.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this &#34;big&#34; calculator. I even like it better than the actual &#34;big&#34; calculator I acquired two years ago. It's very easy to use. Thanks!
0425263916|5.0|I like this author and this series. I am not a fast reader but have no trouble finishing Sylvia Day's books.  I have started to read other books by her too.  I cannot wait for the next book in this series that is due out in June.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this a lot. Love it! I like to play this game at my table while digesting food after dinner.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I do like to buy the Greatest Hits of various people.  I do like all the songs that were selected on this CD
0812550706|5.0|I bought this for my friend's birthday. Been a great book to read even as an adult. I would recommend it.
B005LAJ212|5.0|One of the best programs on TV.  The plot is so complicated that you need the DVD to keep going back to understand everything.  I look so forward to Sunday nights.  When it is not on every week you can get easily confussed. I have already preordered Season II.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The movie is fascinating. I had a copy before but lost it years before. Now watching it it's still as good
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game. It has great graphics. It's very fun to take care of and compete the horses..
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love this CD!!! Everyone has to see it live. Jackie Burns is my favorite Elphie by far. Ok now go buy it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Why do I have  to write so much, I just like playing it, don't love it just like it. OK
B0070Y46UY|4.0|An instant classic wonderfully written for all ages, with unexpected twists and turns; man against nature alongside the unrequited arguments of free-will versus divinity. A definite must read.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|I use it on my Fire HD, which doesn't have GPS. Therefore I can't take full advantage of the app without manually inserting a location. However, the information provided is interesting and presented in a pleasant format.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|The photography, stories, and acting are all very good.  It's one of those movies you want to watch 3 or 4 times to absorb it all.  And it's of such high quality like The Matrix trilogy.  I hope this movie will become a huge seller on DVD and BluRay, because I don't think it did so well in theaters (not enough marketing and 3 hours long), but I want the movie making industry to know that these types of high quality stories and movies are what people want.  Here's to hoping the Wachowski's continue to come out with more quality movies like this.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|This game is good, but it definitely does NOT stand out as a great, original game. The only thing I find unique is the Safari thing to search around a map to find animals for your zoo. The graphics are relatively good, but I've seen better. Overall, I think people shouldn't get this, it's just not good enough.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|&#34;Life of Pi&#34; is a sorry excuse for a book based on sheer plagiarism.<br /><br />Read &#34;Max and the Cats&#34;, by Brazilian author Moacyr Scliar, published years before &#34;Life of Pi&#34;. There you will find all the same elements that make up the plot of the latter, only without the mambo jambo that Martel's book is full of, as it makes you waste valuable life time reading detailed descriptions of disconnected elements on religion, zoology, and survival in the sea gibberish. In other words, &#34;Life of Pi&#34; extracted its core plot from &#34;Max and the Cats&#34;, and Martel's slight, although meaningless, variations on irrelevant aspects cannot disguise that reallity, once both stories' frameworks are exactly the same in both cases.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, Martel has already publicly admitted that he indeed plagiarized Scliar, who Martel suggested was was a &#34;minor&#34; writer that had wasted a good story, this way adding insult to injury.<br /><br />But the fact is that Martel thinks too much of his own work. And he's been helped a lot by a sort of &#34;dictatorship of the sole-way-of-thinking&#34; we live in nowadays, where &#34;a truth&#34; is manufactured, from one day to the other, by means of some sort of media &#34;synchronized adoption&#34; (bitter sarcasm intended) of certain books coupled with massive advertisement, so people can sheeply swallow and ruminate &#34;the truth&#34; in vogue, whenever there's an urge to purport a fashionable opinion.<br /><br />In addition to the shameful, distinctive plagiarism it bears, &#34;Life of Pi&#34; is plain foolish and, contrary to what incomprehensibly has been spread by the &#34;propaganda&#34; around that book (mainly foster by its publishers), far from containing, let alone revealing, any inspiring message.<br /><br />If you have some sort of painful, compulsive wish towards throwing away money and time, look no further. The sense of being totally decieved that one feels after finishing that book might prove rewarding at least in such circumstance.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|&#34;Love this movie . . . . . Steve Carell and Jason Segal are perfect for this film . . . . KIDZ love it !!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great PBS show.  I was disappointed in season 2 ending. I hope they will make the 3rd season better when characters decided to leave the show.  It just seems they picked the same ending for 2 main characters.
B000AGTPUU|3.0|Really Good story with GREAT graphics . . . . however, it lasted alittle too long . . . found myself fast-forwarding through some of the scenes.
B000ZP6MIY|5.0|I'm not the type to dole out five stars very often, but I must do that here.  These Crocs ROCK.  I was looking for something for the warmer weather for walking around in the spring muddy yard of mine, and these really do the trick.  You can just hose them off after.<br />Make sure you get this style with no vent holes in the sides if you're going to get them all messy, so you don't get dirty feet.  I like the navy blue, too, because it doesn't show the dirt.  They fit a little larger than whatever size you take, so order a half-size down, unless you like them roomy, like I do.  There are little nubbies inside the shoes that massage your bare feet, a pleasant surprise!<br />They are lightweight and easy to slip on, and I love the strap in the back to keep them on.  Highly recommended and I am going to buy another pair!
B003L0R090|5.0|Sometimes overlooked but a good album, a bit mellower than some of their material. I love to listen to this on a quiet Sunday morning.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Fun game, however a little repetitious in levels. Does a great job in baiting you to spend $ for upgrades. Overall a great game to kill some time with.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Igot the wrong movie but they gave me all my mouny back and they let me keep the movie that they did send

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I am still adjusting to the shape of this mouse, after using a G9x for the last 5 or so years.  So my review will be biased slightly because of this adjustment time.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the thumb button gets hit accidentally when held the way my hand wants to hold this mouse.  I need to adjust my hand further forward on this mouse, or use a \\"claw\\" style grip, to avoid that problem.  Both of those are more difficult to adjust to than I expected.  I'm an old gamer, and change comes slow.  Still, if the button were moved up or resized slightly smaller, this would not be a problem for me.<br /><br />I would also make two changes to the DPI button: move it to an easier to access location, and add a second, \\"reverse\\" direction, DPI button (so I don't have to cycle 3 modes forward to get the the previous mode).  I may reassign the thumb buttons to achieve this.<br /><br />The software has every feature that I need: multiple profiles, each with custom sensitivity settings and multiple DPI settings, detailed button mapping, and even adjustable polling rates (though I do not use this yet).<br /><br />The logo illuminates and pulses, which is kinda cool.  It's a good looking mouse without appearing as though they are trying too hard.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|i love this game i have played it sence game 1 but THE GAME RESETS IF I LEAVE IT ON MY REEF SHARK AND I HAVE TH MAKO SHARK!!!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I just finished the book wonder and I thought it was superb. I gave it four stars because I seriously couldn't put my kindle down, literally. It probably one of the best books I've ever read, besides The Apothecary which is also great. The reason it's not five stars is that at one point in the story were they don't even put any capital letters. Basically ALL the grammar was wrong. This is defiantly a story I will remember for a long time.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this app worked for a while and I played it all the time and lately its been not opening I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it still did it after a while so I'm done with it now.

B003AVPV1O|4.0|I wanted to run two additional monitors off of my laptop.  Other VGA splitters had multiple conflicting photos.  I wasn't sure what I was getting.  I needed a VGA splitter - with two female adapters - that could be screwed into by two male units (no pun intended).<br /><br />This unit arrived exactly as pictured.  It worked perfectly as soon as I plugged it in.  There were no ghosted (double) images.  And each display showed the entire output on the full screen.  No portions of the image were cut off.  Unfortunately, the picture quality was significantly DEGRADED.  Both monitors were noticeably darker.  One monitor is a Samsung 22\\" LCD.<br /><br />My other monitor is a brand new Samsung 22\\" LED model, so the image loss was especially disappointing.  This degraded condition remains even if ONE of the monitors is turned OFF.  The only way to restore the picture quality - is to remove the Star Tech VGA splitter -- and to hook-up ONE of the monitors directly to my laptop.<br /><br />This VGA splitter is indeed plug-and-play.  But it's OK only if maintaining brightness and high resolution are NOT important.  If you want to MAINTAIN picture quality - on BOTH monitors - here's the item to buy instead.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000M3CDZU Aluratek AVS02 2-Port VGA Video Splitter]]
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Great movie, kept me interested from start to finnish. Would recommend to everyone. I thought that it was far better than ARGO.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|This allows the 6th Gen iPod Nano to charge instead of running total loss. The connectors snap in firmly, which was a bit disconcerting, as I thought I would break it pushing it in at either end. Works flawlessly. I can still use my steering wheel controls and the buttons on the CD Changer\Radio. Total Bliss!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I love this game my sister said Brooke I got a new game don't delete it so I went to go see what she got I played it I was playing all night long.GET THIS APP!<br />u
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is a hilarious recount of 20th century events through the amazing story of its protagonist. It leaves you with a big smile on your face and the deepest appreciation of the gift of life and everything that might just be waiting around the corner.
B0086700CM|4.0|so its alright but the 2nd is better exept I cant open the app so I like this one more it doesn't kick me off like the other one
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great site if you are looking for ideas for anything from recipes to party ideas to vacation places.  Just type in anything you are looking for and watch the ideas pop.
B009186JNO|4.0|It was &#34;new&#34; and sort of good if you like the early years of the stones! The years while Brian Jones was still alive and with them. Some of it is a little humorous some is sort of ridiculous but at the time fine.<br />So I mostly would recommend this to early stones fans.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I don't normally buy games, but for 99 cents I thought I'd give it a shot.  This game is fun and I find myself itching to get to the next level.  worth the price.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|The delivery was fast and the album was in great condition. I would recommend this product to anyone! Wouldnt care if Frank Ocean dressed in drag, the music is amazing!
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I suggest that you don't. get this app because it the started right when I was about to get the Great White Shark. I hats this game
B005HSL626|5.0|I like this game, my son loves it. My wife doesn't understand why, all is perfect with the world. yup
0718177029|5.0|Well written, with insights to all involved, the end was so sad but it was his &#34;me&#34; that dictated this ending.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Fun all the way through, more focused than some of Banks' novels, and it definitely felt a lot shorter than its length!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I gave this book a four star because once you start reading you can't stop. It is very romantic. I would definitely read it again and recommend it to everyone
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Mark Owen brings some truth to the coverage of the raid on Bin Laden's compound. The official releases have either overlooked a lot of the information or have deliberately distorted it and Owen sets the record straight.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Very funny. My future step-dad says hey babe in his voice and Tom copies it a little higher but funnier. Even when I laugh from my backseat of the car it causes a very high pitched funny voice.<br />It doesn't even get boring.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well all I can say is that as an adult I have never been more into a story written as I was with the hunger games. I started to feel uneasy reading about the lives of the children but the story kept me so engrossed that I somehow dismissed the reality of it and the characters became the main focus of my reading more of the story . Great read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app doesn't only work amazingly but it also always there for you and is way easier than going nonlinear and finding a calculator on the Internet. This app is so awesome and I definetely reccomend it especially because it is free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|a lot of fun and good graphics. great way to spend some time and easy to use. great for all ages
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I thought it might be a disappointing game but I was wrong. This game gives you plenty to do without tasking up all of your time.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|Better then nothing, however difficult to use  need to integrate with calendar and advance if not completed.<br />What do I expect.  Price-free
B00BKTWBMA|5.0|Eric Clapton has been one of my favorites my whole life and I was not disappointed by the rich, wonderful and a little sage voice of a truly great musician.  Age has done him no harm, loved it!
B004IOVGW0|5.0|Timeless.  Entertaining.  Well done.  Basic story on life and what fulfills us and troubles us.<br />One needs to be healthy mentally, physically and emotionally to be truly healthy.  The story shows this.<br />The play is excellent also-on Broadway.
B0035JRVBO|4.0|Bought this for the wife. it's a classic. if she's happy then that's all that matters.not much too say really.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|5 stars for this show. It is funny, clever, original, and full of great characters. Can't get enough, and it just gets better as the series continues. The whole world should know about this show!
B0050PYNO4|4.0|Bought it for the wife. not sure what she see's in it but she does love this movie. if she's happy!!!!!

B007OWG3LM|5.0|To me, this is the Sigur Ros album that affects me in the deepest way. Every sound and vocal melody is stunningly beautiful and comforting, every note is a musical wonder. I'm going to stop here.
B007REV4YI|4.0|For all of the James Bond 007 fans, I highly recommend it.  it was well worth the money paid for it.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Finally all I waited for. Kind of wish the books ended with this one , but I'm going to go on to the next one and find out what happens. Love these books!!
B000002KD9|5.0|This is one of Young's best albums.  The songs range in subject matter from introspection (Tell me Why), to protest songs (Tell me Why), to love songs (The Morning comes) to sing along ballads (Cripple Creek Ferry.)  The sound is more consistent, it's heavily influenced by country and folk music.  Every song is solid and quite a few are Young standards.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn kicks off with one of the most disturbing opening passages I've ever read, hands-down. Immediately, from the very first words, the reader gets the sense that this narrator is a little.... off. The innermost thoughts of Nick Dunne, a husband facing a life-shattering crisis on his five-year anniversary, are attention grabbing, to say the least. And immediately, from the first few sentences, this jarring and off-putting voice pushes the reader in a certain direction, creates expectations, draws assumptions.<br /><br />Nick's chapters are dove-tailed by excerpts from the diary of his wife, Amy. Beautiful heiress and literary household name, Amy seems close to perfect. As the story of her marriage to Nick unfolds in the past, alongside the investigation of her disappearance in the present, I was baffled again and again at how artfully Flynn unravels the mystery behind a truly crazy marriage. Every time I jumped to a conclusion as a reader, Flynn gleefully turned my expectations on their ear once again. My opinion of Nick and Amy shifted dramatically throughout the novel -- not once, but numerous times. And I loved every plot-twisty minute.<br /><br />Before I even finished this book, I had referred it to no fewer than five people. And I will continue to recommend it, because I've never quite read anything like it before. It's a head-shaking character study of a love story gone very, very wrong, written by a master - and I can't wait to read it again with fresh eyes.
B000006NPY|4.0|This is the Pumpkins departure from guitar driven rock into the world of electronica.  It's dark, brooding and filled with Corrigan's haunting lyrics.  The album's primary problem is it's length, some of the better songs near the end become obscured by the many similar tempo songs.<br /><br />At its release this alienated a lot of Smashing Pumpkin fans.  It's well worth a second look now.  It's a change from their previous albums, but it's more of a step forward than a complete break with the past.
0307341550|5.0|Based on the book jacket excerpt, I assumed Sharp Objects -- Gillian Flynn's first novel -- would be my least favorite of her three published works. I've never really gotten the \\"cutter\\" mystique.<br /><br />Of course, this turned out to be just another example of Flynn taking my expectations and completely flipping them on their ear. It's a tough call, but I might have to say Sharp Objects is my favorite of her books. So far.<br /><br />Sharp Objects is as dark and gritty as it gets. There are so many taboo issues at play in the story -- from preteen sex, to pervasive alcohol and drug abuse, to self-harm -- it could feel distracting, or even worse, exploitative. But Flynn is masterful at creating characters who aren't necessarily likeable, but that you can't help caring about anyway. Camille Preaker, cub reporter and recovering cutter, provides a very interesting perspective on a small town murder mystery: She's a small-town girl who moved to the big city, only to be drawn home again to cover a series of disturbing child murders. The crime story is gripping and will keep you turning pages -- and as in her other books, Flynn does not disappoint with the unexpected twists and sudden plot flips -- but the characters in this story felt especially strong to me. Messed up, yes. But strong. I'm still thinking about them.<br /><br />Another thing I love about Flynn: She is a writer who loves words. Her books aren't full of unnecessary purple prose, but she's also not afraid to write a simple passage with some unexpected beauty or surprising handling. The book is full of small moments like this, and even some clever nods to \\"word nerds.\\" Example: One of the most disturbing and cruel characters in the book is named \\"Amity.\\" Priceless.<br /><br />This is a fantastic read, and another title of Flynn's that I'm recommending to everyone I know.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the series of books, i couldn't put it down. Can't wait for another book, hopefully there will be one soon!!
0307341577|5.0|After devouring Gone Girl, I couldn't wait to get my hands on more from Gillian Flynn. After only a few pages of Dark Places, it was obvious that I was going to love Flynn's earlier work just as much. Maybe even a little more.<br /><br />Flynn is masterful at creating characters that aren't the least bit likeable, but completely engaging. For example, it's hard to feel sympathy for the \\"heroine,\\" prickly shoplifter Libby Day, short-tempered, unmotivated, entitled -- and the lone survivor of her family's mass murder in the Satan-crazed '80s. But it's impossible not to want to peel back the layers of her story, to shine a light on Libby's titular \\"dark places.\\" And chapters told in alternating voices, including Libby's murdered mother, Patty, and her big brother, Ben, imprisoned for his family's grisly murders, provide a great way to slowly unfurl the truth behind the night of the killings.<br /><br />Once again, Flynn has captured a single day gone horribly wrong in the life of a truly twisted American family. And once again, I was genuinely blindsided when the author's carefully plotted reveal finally played out. What a great read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Once I read the first book of the series I was hooked and this is a book series that I will read over and over again!! Can't wait for another one!!
006224454X|5.0|Before I Go to Sleep is one of the best things I've read this year. From the very first page, I knew it was going to be one of those books you just can't put down, and S.J. Watson did not disappoint.<br /><br />This tense thriller introduces Christine, an amnesiac whose memory resets every night while she sleeps. Some mornings, the 47-year-old wakes thinking she's a college student -- on others, she rouses and believes she is even younger. She never remembers her husband, Ben, who seems to love her very much and who has built his life around her care and comfort. She has no memory of her career accomplishments or what has happened to all her family and friends. Most of her adult life is a total blank slate.<br /><br />Then, Christine get a phone call from a man who claims to be her doctor, and who urges her to go to the closet, open a shoebox, and recover a diary she has been keeping without Ben's knowledge, as part of treatment she's sought behind her husband's back. Through her own journal entries, we as readers learn Christine's secrets as she does, and unravel the mystery of her condition -- and her strange marriage -- through flashbacks of recovered memories.<br /><br />I loved this book, and can't believe it is a first effort by the author. Watson masterfully doles out small details of Christine's life and meticulously builds a mystery with a twist I truly didn't see coming. And that's my favorite kind.<br /><br />Christine is very likeable and sympathetic as a main character -- although she's not reliable, I wanted to believe her, and I was frantic to put together the pieces of her story. It's creative and very \\"different\\" from most other books in this genre, and I look forward to recommending it to friends who like a suspenseful mystery as much as I do.<br /><br />I hope this is only the first of many books by Watson, and will eagerly await her next release.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Director Steven Spielberg brings the last four months of Abraham Lincoln's life into this focused historical epic that had been long in the works.<br /><br />As the Civil War comes to an end, and shortly after Lincoln has won re-election, the president is faced with the process of abolishing slavery with his workings to pass the 13th Amendment through a very divided and partisan House of Representatives.  The genuine concern of this issue is palpable through the screen.<br /><br />The film serves not only as a political drama, but a deep character study of the Lincoln family through the turmoil of war, political impasse and the serious emotional impact of life in the White House.  At two and a half hours long, the film has a steadied and deliberate pace that certainly doesn't rush, but is certainly more concerned with maintaining both interest and reveal.<br /><br />Spielberg re-teams with former Munich collaborators: cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, editor Michael Kahn, screenwriter Tony Kushner and composer John Williams.  They were all nominated for Academy Awards for their work on Lincoln.  The production design, costume design and editing are absolutely remarkable, as big-budget historical epics rely on the excelled success of depicting the past, telling a story out of time, and making it feel and look accurate.  Lincoln succeeds in a great manor.<br /><br />When it comes down to the film, however, more than Spielberg's directing, the impact of the film relies on the layered and masterful performances of its actors.  Daniel Day-Lewis obviously won his third Best Actor Oscar for his role as the president.  He is a powerhouse throughout the whole film, yet, in his chameleon way, he strives for the restrained dignity and humanism of his character.  However, David Straitharn, Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, John Hawkes, and Hal Holbrook all give absolutely masterful veteran performances as well.  James Spader and Joseph Gordon-Levitt also deliver noteworthy performances.  This is clearly an ensemble film cast and finished by the hands of a master.<br /><br />The dark, brooding look and feel of the film is paired perfectly with its serious, conversational tone.  This is yet another masterwork from Spielberg, which, at this point in his career, his audience never expects anything less.<br /><br />I watched part of the film on my laptop and the second half through my Playstation on the big screen.  The streaming was clear and the sound was even better, probably not as good as the Blu-ray release, but it didn't disappoint. The nuances of the accents and the breaths between the speeches and stories are affecting and rousing.<br /><br />Great film, highly recommended.  One of the few films I had no qualms paying as much as I used to at the video store to watch.  I would love to re-watch in Blu-ray, which always says something about a film that is worthy to view multiple times.ces.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|There are things with the story that I do not like.  Victor Hugo is a Holywood screen-writer before his time.  His characters are one dimensional and he hammers home his message Thor-like.  Sublety and Verisimilitude are not Victor Hugo's strengths.  Just how many people you know are like Bishop Myriel, and how many soldiers you know would shoot Gavroche dead?  How many people do you know are like Javert, let alone like Jean Valjean.  These may walk of two legs, but they're not human beings.  They're celestial and infernal beings born purely from Victor Hugo's dime-store-novel worthy imagination.<br /><br />However, the film has to be true to the source material, and given that limitation, it's perfect.  The maudlin parts are maudlin (The girl behind me was sobbing like her mother and her favorite puppy had just died at the same time).  The uplifting parts were uplifting.  The preachy parts were uncomfortably preachy, and for the most part the singing was great.  I especially liked Eponine's songs.  I believe that the part of Eponine was cast perfectly.  With the exception of Russell Crowe, the singers sang their hearts out and could sing very well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|its awesome game. it kept me very entertained. I honestly wish I could purchase it so I can keep playing.
B002M87V0A|4.0|Enjoyed watching on the computer and connecting to my flat screen.these are extra words needed to complete this review ok.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was amazing and also amazing to read I loved the book it still is a m a z i n g .
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This was a sweet story, and a profound tale. It wandered around a bit in places, but I really liked the message, to follow your dreams.  When Santiago tells the alchemist \\"My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,\\" I thought--how much does fear of suffering in one form or another hold so many of us back?<br /><br />It contained many little truths and snippets of humanity's wisdom, but delivers them in such a straightforward manner, they nearly slip by without making the impact they deserve.<br /><br />A great example of the simple art of an ancient pastime--storytelling, and no doubt, a future classic.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is a game that has a great storyline, beautiful graphics, and is nicely challenging to play.  I would recommend it for everyone.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I was worried about wearing out the micro USB connector on my Nexus 10 so I bought this since it connects magnetically. It snaps in place firmly and charges a bit quicker than using the same charger via the micro USB connector.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My son LOVES this movie. He cant get enough of it and we have only had it a week. Worth it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is way better than most movies you can purchase.  11 hours of amazing acting and plot for $15-20.  The third season is the best yet.  I wish it were twice as long!!!!
B00A14SQBU|4.0|Christina is a good vocalist. Several songs were good. a few were ok. Nothing surprising. Typical style of performer. recommended if on sale
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season was the best.  It supplied suspense and drama plus it brought us back some familiar faces.  I am super excited to see the last episode for the season.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|There are a several good songs on the album and a few okay songs. It's worth it if you like POP music
B00BF123WG|5.0|A movie every American should watch.  Great director, great acting, very pleased it got nominated at the Oscars this year.
B00BO2768C|5.0|A perfect television show for Jedi of all ages. As each season progresses the animation gets better and better. Would have been nice to see where the crew could have gone if given the opportunity.
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|I was so excited to see this movie when I watched it it was just a snoozefest. there were some interesting parts but the rest was boring especially the raid I thought it was going be badass but I was dead wrong. This film was very disappointing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great except for the fact that it constantly update the compititions. Thats easy to fix though, i just dissconect from my wifi and it doesnt update! thanks for the great game!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I really like this cd much more up beat then the last 3. i bought the double and liked 16 out of 17 songs. David Gahan voice sounded great throughout the whole Album. I didn't want to like after hearing Heaven. I thought they were going away from the electronic sound but I was wrong. They have tons of electronics on delta machine. My favorites were welcome to my world, soft touch/raw nerve,soothe my soul.
B008KEQMDC|5.0|I know a lot of people who didn't see this movie on principal - but being 2 months pregnant when it was released in theaters I had to see it! I don't know it I would have liked as much if I was single with no kids to compare the things they go through with... but being a mom of 3 I laughed so hard!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I like all Harry Bosch books.  They are fast moving, entertaining, and interesting. Whenever one is available, I read it.
B008KUQSQC|4.0|Given 41,000 Christian denominations, academic research forums estimate that 22,000 Christian-god belief variants survive in the U.S. today, so in this novel's context--in which Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, Mormon, Restoration, Anabaptist, Orthodox, Pentecostal, Evangelical, and all other conflict-begotten derivations of Mother Church are excluded by Gaiman (perhaps to quell all bellowing that his tale should be posted on some DO NOT READ list) it should not have surprised me that a handful of old gods walk about small-town America in shabby apparel, or partake in health-defying fixes (smoking; junk-food gobbling; soda guzzling; alcohol); nor should I have been surprised at being introduced to gods such as this: ones deflated by jealousy, squabbling over their obscurity in America, or by the end of his story offering up excuses for a murderous sacrifice of innocents; yet Gaiman did surprise, and was full of it--report I, in the nicest way: delusion + fantasy + dreams cleave to the human animal, yet here are elevated to page-turning.<br /><br />Still, there's little to account for my turning all 588 pages effortlessly, and then mulling how it'd be fun to resume at pg 1...immediately. I'd get more from a second go-round, for sure. Yet from round one: Make no myth-take, gods are alive and roam our planet to this day; an irredeemable one takes road-trips to recruit his fellows for a furtive purpose--to displace our modern gods: Television; Internet; credit cards; texting; Hollywood; golden arches; androids, Facebook; YouTube--ones with intensely practical or worldly niches, offering us dynamic and entertaining tangibles. A few of these even make us laugh.<br /><br />Gaiman's protagonist is Shadow, a guy who makes on-point wry asides, such as, referencing America: \\"This is a bad land for Gods\\" -though he's always bumping into one or another of em after his early release from prison--this unexpected freedom resulting from his wife's death, by car crash (a crash she'd caused climaxically by making her boss Bobby, who was driving her home late that fateful night, really rapturously happy) Adapting to Gaiman's cryptic reality, where myth + legend cohabit in 21st century America, a reader is apt to find that going along with him is a kick--providing one can accept Shadow's disinclination to be a tad curious about incongruous stuff, or even a wee bit more skeptical. (Go-an, he's a True Believer, Eric Hoffer) Yet Shadow is observant. However detached he struck me (due, I decided, to his wife's decomposition) Shadow does take a job fresh out of the clink without much thought, and accepts his eccentric new boss, who calls himself `Wednesday,' without reserve.<br /><br />[NOTE: My favorite fiction bubbles up within a very real pot (that's pot, not plot) which includes Philip Roth, Richard Ford, Joseph Heller, Toni Morrison, Michael Cunningham, Steinbeck, V.S. Naipaul and J.M. Coetzee, spilling their literary guts--i.e., fiction that is much less horror or phantasmagorical and far more substantive than this--so may I be forgiven for having wondered: what in hell is going on here, in this story? I'd scarcely recalled ever reading anything like it; the possible exceptions of Terry Pratchett's Going Postal and Tom Robbins' Jitterbug Perfume came to mind. When American Gods was recommended--as a top favorite--I'd failed to ask my friend the genre, so I did not know (my lapse) that this book fell under `science fiction'; and I'm glad I didn't know, as my preconceived notions now wither--as do innumerable gods ]<br /><br />A key obstacle for an ancient god--be he Baldr, Thor, Wodan, Loki, Eastre, Atum, Aker, Ash, Ninevah, Tammuz (you get the idea)--is that over oceans of time + actual oceans his worshipers would tire of or misplace him; new charmers caught their eye; others fancied the latest n greatest--a god who better fit a lifestyle, perhaps. So yes, gods do lose potency, and in Gaiman's chimera it pisses them off; what follows is violence, divisiveness, fear, mayhem--necessary sparks for any god's earthly foothold.<br /><br />Having written all this, there is no recommendation. It's in your corner. So if critical thinking isn't your cup o' tea, then nibble on Gaiman's English biscuits. Gods know he gives readers plenty to savor here (that's savor, not savior)ivisiveness, fear, mayhem--necessary sparks for any god's earthly foothold.<br /><br />Having written all this, there is no recommendation.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm a bit overweight but my main goal for wanting to exercise is to be fitter and healthier. I've never been a fit person, and the fact that I'm out of breath running after the bus despite only being 27 is an embarrassment. I tried exercising by going to the gym - it's expensive, time-consuming for travel, too many people hogging the machines. I tried jogging for a while, thinking I'll at least get cardio in - but I hate running in the daytime in front of a lot of people, the weather is hectic in my area, and running at night isn't safe either due to wildlife. This is when I decided to try the home workout DVDs. I only wanted to try the ones that had good reviews. First one I tried was P90X - I was traumatized for at least 6 months straight. 5 minutes of P90X led me to 2 weeks of burning, unbearable pain. I gave up on that one. Then I came across Jillian Michaels' DVDs, and it's a godsend. It is intensive enough without being overly intimidating. The first time I tried it, I did feel the burn and had about 3 days of intense leg pain. But I went back to it after a week's rest, and it worked out fine. Jillian is right in the DVD when she says \\"your body will adapt.\\" I sometimes lose motivation, but I can always come back to it. Some people say she \\"talks too much\\" - that's what works for me, it's great motivation to push you through. I'm now able to run for the bus without losing my breath!<br /><br />For people who have complained about knee injuries - I noticed that most, if not all of them, were already aware of their health problems/knee weakness - it just goes to show that if you already have major health problems, CONSULT A DOCTOR before starting any sort of diet/exercise programs. This cannot be stressed enough. I have low iron deficiency and I always talk to my doctor before starting any sort of diet/exercise regimes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is by far my favorite site. It has so many great ides from tattoos to DIY. I'm on it everyday and haven't grown tired of it yet. I really love the Home Decor and the DIY sections. They've given me so many great ideas. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Pinterest!!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Wonderful app great and easy to use. It has real satellite maps. But you need Wi-Fi access. I strongly recommend this app.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love this game! I play it all the time. It's a very cool Pictionary-esque game. Loads of fun. My only gripe is that there aren't enough words. Hopefully, the next update will add more.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of those books that I kept hearing about and seeing on various \\"Best\\" lists, but just couldn't force myself to read because the premise sounded totally depressing. The joke's on me because I ended up loving it and understanding all the hype.<br /><br />There is some sadness (how could there not be with this type of story?), but it's surrounded by enough humor and honesty to balance it out.<br /><br />This is a character-driven story and I loved Hazel and Augustus. They're smart, witty, and playful despite being in horrific circumstances. Occasionally, their characters fall into the \\"Dawson's Creek\\" trap of having conversations that are way beyond the language and thought process of your average teenager. And, these kids have read far more serious \\"literature\\" and poetry at age 17 than I've read at age 34. But, who wants to read 300 pages of \\"OMGs, LMAOs, and likes\\", which I'm guessing might be closer to how a realistic teenager speaks today? I want to read smart, witty dialogue even if you sacrifice a bit of reality in the process.<br /><br />After reading the book, I discovered that John Green is also well-known for his video blogs and has a huge Twitter following. As a caveat to my thoughts on his book, I must say that I was not an established \\"John Green fan\\" before reading it (I'm not one of his Twitter followers and haven't seen any of the video blogs)...I just loved the book for what it is.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|A little unrealistic on certain points but still a good story and you find yourself getting very involved with the characters and rooting for them at every turn. I'm not much of a romance novel fan and I'm glad the author added some mystery and intrigue so that the eroticism didn't overwhelm the novel. I would love to see a fourth book from Christian's perspective, considering I finished all 3 books in under a week.
B001B1UO6W|4.0|I actually really like this movie. It's not scary to me (although it might have been if I had seen it when I was younger). It definitely has a horror/ suspense feel to it. I recommend it. Oh and thank you to Mr. Brad Dourif (voice of Chucky/Charles Lee Ray) for all your hard work on this film.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|When I initially heard this movie featured Santa, The Easter Bunny and Tooth fairy (to name a few characters) I thought to myself, \\"skip\\". However this movie does some really fun things with these childhood fantasy figures that are original and compelling. And the entire movie is absolutely gorgeous to the eye. Muted, this movie would be worth watching simply for the beautiful animation. If this movie played on a loop in an electronics store, they would sell more big screen TVs. I'm just sayin'. We laughed, we cried, and everyone of us agreed that this was one of the most entertaining things we've seen in a while.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This calculator does everthing I need it to do. I had hhis ap on my Kindle Fire and I oot it again when I got my Kindle Fire HD. This calculator is huge on the bigger screen! I recomend this ap for whatever model of Kindle Fire you have.
B00BF2RTO2|3.0|To start off, I am a HUGE Iron Maiden fan. I have everything they have released, but I think they hurried this dvd. First off the concert is NOT 16x9 it's in 4x3 aspect. The second is that the new documentry seemed to be hurried. They seemed to have lost focus on this package. The 2 prior packages were AMAZING. I think they could have spent a little more time and made it better.<br /><br />Remember I am a fan and hate writing this. The concert is great and I've been waiting for this to be released for year I just wanted it to be perfect like EVERYTHING else the Maiden has released. Hopefully thet release the 2012 version of the Maiden England Tour on Blu-ray.<br /><br />UP THE IRONS!!!!!

B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie surprised me.  It was a delight to watch and drew me in.  Having read the book, which I loved, I wasn't sure if I'd like the movie but I did.  It was a piece of art.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|It was something, great, horrible, tiring, very well done, hard to watch, intriguing, Musically fantastic, captivating , Russell Crowe was fabulous to hate! loved him. Of course Anne Hathaway was superb. Daniel Huttlestone was such a good little actor.  I watched it three times in the  48 hour rental . wished i just bought it.  It is a must see!
B006Z7XNVK|2.0|The story is captivating and gains momentum throughout but comes to an abrupt and confusing ending as if the production crew ran out of film.  The acting is superb.  This basically views like a UCLA film student's final project.
B003CF0XDE|5.0|I got this as a gift for a german friend.<br />He loves the performer and already has many of his recordings<br />but seemed to enjoy this complete set<br />It was an amazing price for such an extensive set of recordings<br /><br />Although it did seem to take a while to arrive

B00AU2B0DE|5.0|Okay since Justin Bieber came out it seemed like only little girls liked him so I never really caught on to the whole Bieber train, until now... This album is like pure gold. Now I feel kinda stupid for never giving him much of a chance honestly. This album completely changed my view on him. One of the best albums I have ever listened too. Every song is good (which is almost never the case even with really good artists). This is extremely good and now I am kinda confused as to why they autotune his voice in the original Believe album. It's not needed at all. Well now this 20 year old is a Belieber too. :D
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not good not bad kinda slow really boring sometimes I'm 11 and this is what is say to the other kids get this app and see if u like it cuz I dont

B009VIZDLI|4.0|A light, well-written, warm, entertaining love story. It is one of those books that makes you believe that we all have a chance to fall in love, no matter how quirky or different we may be. If you enjoy the &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34; TV series, then you will enjoy reading about the 'Sheldon-like' character and following life and the trials of finding love through his eyes and words.

B009AMANBA|1.0|When political correctness run amok, and lies become truth, then the whole world will have gone insane!<br /><br />I have been a studant of history for over 30 years, and well verse in the Civil War. History has not told the truth of Lincoln's racial views. Licoln did not believe that blacks and whites could co-exist, in fact he had stated that when the war was over, he was going to see to it that all blacks would be returned to Africa. Licoln fought the war for industrial interest, not over slavery. Lincoln believed that slavery was a social issue, and not a political issue and wanted nothing to do with it. The only reason he did, was because the South was winning the war, and he needed an excuse to continue the war, and he chose slavery as \\"his\\" cause. In fact, Gen. Grant and Gen. Sherman had stated that if the war was going to be about slavery, that they would in fact leave the Union and fight for the South. Even Jefferson Davis did not believe in slavery. In fact, over 50,000 men of non-white descent fought for the South, including blacks, Cubans, Mexicans, Native Americans and Irish. But history is full of holes and lies in oder to be politically correct. All of what Lincoln, Grant, Sherman and other and their social views on slavery are in their own words and writings... Filmmakers just continue to subscribe to political correctness, and continue the lies of history.<br /><br />I'll admit, Lewis really does remind you of Lincoln, and may have done an excellent job, but it does not save this film from false history and continues to be re-visionist history in favor of Lincoln and the Union.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first started watching Firefly I think it was love at first sight. I love Sci-fi and have always enjoyed a good story, but with most shows it take's me a while to come to love the characters and really care about what they are doing. Not so with Firefly. From the very beginning I came to care about what each and every character was doing, and their reasons behind it.<br /><br />Its a shame that this series ended after such a wonder first season. Even knowing that, I would recommend this to anyone every day of the week. In fact I just gave this series to a friend for their birthday.<br /><br />The melody of old west, modern corrupt government, old traditions and space exploration made this seem almost real. Its dirty and not perfect, and I wouldn't change anything about it... (except the fact that it was canceled!)<br /><br />I wonder if I could pay for an amazing trip through space for the price of a strawberry...

B0054VVRBQ|5.0|Downloaded and the OSX driver on my Macbook Pro, rebooted and plugged the Express Card in.  Inserted my Micro SDXC (with adapter) into the card and worked great - much faster than using the USB 2.0.  This will come in handy when downloading HD video from my Gopro and NEX-6.  Best is that I don't have to carry a card reader with me anymore.  Finally a good use for the empty express card slot.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|good game good why to pass some time. Five stars for sure better then temple run 1. everyone should upload this game.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|At times It is seriously difficult to put down this book. Jonas Jonasson has written a truly good story. It begins with an old man running away from the old-people-home where he is condemned to live and progresses to include his life long adventures. The inclusions of the earlier episode during his long life, of course interrupt the main course of event after his departure from the old-people- home but it further provide a better description of the old man's character and at the end provide justifications for his actions that from a legal point of view may be considered as in the grey area. Apart from the riveting aspect of the story, it is very humorous and lighthearted. Just the right medicine for the gloomy times that most are grappling with at present.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is fantastic! I enjoyed everything about it. It was very<br />addicting. I wanted to keep playing it. I will play it again because there were 2 puzzles that I had to skip and I will figure them out. Great job on this game! Thank you

B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a lot of fun. This is the first temple run game I've ever played, but i picked up. There is no story line to get lost in our anything so if you haven't played one you can still play this no problem. I also like how the other characters and upgrades are not impossible to earn. With some similar games I've played if you could get new characters it was extremely difficult, but in this one its not hard, I unlocked one after the first time i played. They get pricier as the game goes, but still attainable. I'm not giving five stars, because I reserve those for games and things I can't put down and go a day without. This one, while super fun, is still just a time killer type game. It does offer a lot to come back and play again for, but you won't be miserable if you miss a day or two.

B00BF2RTO2|5.0|Call me sad, but I currently have flights booked and eight tickets for shows on the European leg of the Maiden England 2013 tour. I saw the show when it came to my city and being first to the barrier was nothing short of amazing. But considering one of the shows in particular I have a ticket to- Donington in particular- is an extra special occasion as it's a 25th anniversary show, it'd be a sin to miss it. The 1988 show at Donington Park in Derbyshire, UK was a massive event- the band played to a sold crowd of an estimated 100, 000. Of course, there was a tragedy early in the afternoon- two kids died from an incident in the crowd, and that shook the people up. Yet even still, the sheer response from the crowd was a big event for Maiden, as Maiden they'd headline that park four more times. And it was all thanks to the support tour for Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, aptly titled Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour.<br /><br />The tour was the band's biggest in a long time- since the World Slavery Tour that ran for 11 months and 193 shows, the band's tours became more bombastic and theatrical. This tour would represent the iceberg artwork that decked Seventh Son, meant to look like a frozen lake with icebergs and a mountain in the background. Of course, it's no secret that Bruce Dickinson was critical of the post Powerslave tour sets and even Steve Harris was critical of the STOAST set:<br /><br />\\"We thought the Seventh Son stage show just got a bit out of hand. I mean, the actual Eddie and the backdrops I thought looked amazing, but the giant icebergs and stuff were a bit naff, I think [...]\\"<br /><br />In addition, the road crew hated the icebergs and all the white that covered the stage, as they were nigh-impossible to keep clean. Yet even these stated facts didn't stop the band from going on to document the 1988 tour. On November 27th and 28th, the band played two massive, sold out shows to the Birmingham NEC, which were filmed and recorded for a DVD/CD release. Whereas Rod Smallwood had complete control over Live After Death, Steve had control over Maiden England- his aim was to depict the show through the eyes of the crowd. And boy, does it work well here. There's very few drum kit shots or from the stage shots- the 90% of the show can be seen from the barrier, the balconies, the stands, etc. It's very effective, and at times has a bit of a bootleg vibe, as if it was pieced together from a number of camcorders- this was all Steve's idea, and it worked brilliantly here.<br /><br />THE SHOW<br />The band's performance is on fire here, as they usually are. Bruce had the flu and it's very obvious in his singing, but he still puts on a hell of a show. He still runs and jumps about, messes with the crowd and even plays with a Sooty puppet at one point in a Welsh accent! The key performer on this package is Dave Murray- I've always been biased as his more classical style of guitar was what drew me to Maiden's guitar playing in article, but here, he's must insane. His solos, particularly \\"The Prisoner\\" are just killer. He also runs and jumps about the stage, just like Janick too! Nicko is playful as he always is, and Steve is just bundles of energy personified. This may not be the best performance of theirs, but it's proof that the band has what it takes to never disappoint.<br /><br />The band storm through a 110 minute set that begins with \\"Moonchild\\"- a burst of pyro goes off and the band are in full-on mode. The usual theatricality is there- tons of pyro (gerbs, fireballs, even an Eddie's head on fire), and lighting that sets moods that range from ominous to mystical. There's the usual two eddies- the first makes an appearance during \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" that looks like a scribe, and the second being the usual big Eddie in the style of the SSOASS artwork.<br /><br />Special attention must be drawn to the added encores- in the original release, they weren't featured as of people already had the songs, but here they're backand in full form. The encore begins with \\"Run to the Hills\\", which takes care of itself as it always does. Next is \\"Running Free\\", which is always fierce and fiery, and the band does the usual \\"slowing things down near the end and letting the audience sing along\\" thing they usually do. Last up is \\"Sanctuary\\", and let's just say, this easily justifies the purchase of the DVD. It's as fast and fierce and fiery as it usually is, but one particular part that raises hairs and sends chills is when the lights flash red and blue (emulating police lights) and has the crowd mock the police sirens. Just goes to show you his true showmanship!<br /><br />AS FOR THE REST OF THE DVD...<br /><br />The 5.1 DTS track is the reason to buy the DVD. Mixed by Kevin Shirley, it sums up why I always prefer DTS tracks to Dolby and the sound is just loud, grand and epic. Excellent use of the back speakers with tons of dynamics you can practically breathe in- it'd be a crime not to watch it with the DTS track. As for the special features, the 40 minute documentary does pale compared to the 60 minute one on Live After Death and the 90 minute one on The History of Iron Maiden Part 1: The Early Days. But it's nonetheless entertaining and covers the synth era in 40 minutes- but the most compelling part is when it ends on a chilling cliffhanger where Adrian says bluntly into the camera, \\"I wasn't happy with it at all... and then a year later, I wasn't in the band\\". Bring on the Donington Live 92! The 12 Wasted Years documentary is featured, which is fun to watch, and the promo videos for the hits from both Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son albums, which you most likely already have on Visions of the Beast.<br /><br />In closing, Maiden England '88 is the perfect way to revisit a beloved era for all Maiden fans, and for a number of reasons too. For one, the complete show is available for the first time ever, and it also is just nice to have the show on DVD, PERIOD. Yeah, it does kind of suck there's no blu-ray release, but considering it was shot on video, chances are it wouldn't translate. Either way, this is money well spent! For old fans, it'll be a lovely trip down memory lane, and for the new fans, it's the perfect way to open the door to an era that's considered to be a staggeringly interesting one by even the outsiders.<br /><br />Now, the only thing left I have to say?<br /><br />UP THE IRONS!!!!and in full form.

B005LAII4E|4.0|If you're anything like me you saw the trailer to \\"Retaliation\\" with Snake Eyes and Jinx having a hack `n slash sword fight against a bunch of disposable red-clad ninjas alongside a perilous sheer rockface and you were like \\"awwww yeah!\\"  And then you waited...and waited as the release date got pushed back again and again (presumably to make more room onscreen for Channing Tatum's G.I. Joe \\"Duke\\").  So was the wait worth it?  And does the movie deliver the goods?  Is it at least better than \\"The Rise of Cobra\\"?  Let's review.<br /><br />First off fan favorites Snake Eyes and Stormshadow get more playtime this time around and we dive just a smidge more into their history so, coupled with their frenetic and exciting action sequences, this cinematic aspect of Joe lore satisfies though fans of these characters will still want more (at least of Snake Eyes).  Jinx, a female ninja with ties to both of them, also is an important crossroad connection for these two ninja brothers and her presence (played austerely by Elodie Yung) lends a bit of platonic heart to this testosterone-spewing slug out of a film.  Second Dwayne Johnson is on board as Roadblock, second in command after Duke.  Johnson has that piquant charisma that just commands your attention whenever he's on screen and that's true here but I expected his Roadblock to be a mean mountain hulk of a soldier with pure bullish bravado much like his characters in \\"The Rundown\\" and especially \\"Fast Five\\"; while he has a little of this he is played up more as an intuitive soldier, a man to both have your back and be your friend.  I was a bit surprised by this but Johnson is easy to watch so terrific casting as far as I'm concerned!  And speaking of terrific casting Bruce Willis shows up with a nothing's-ever-so-bad-that-you-have-to-take-it-too-seriously General Joe Colton, the original general infantry grunt of this special ops group.  Willis (who doesn't seem to age, does he?) carries himself with his styled brass and insolence and is a good fit in the Joe universe.  And then there's Duke (Tatum) whose face on the posters just might bring in an extra cache of coin both here in the States and overseas.  (*SPOILER*ALERT*)  As you may have guessed, though, he's not in the film much.  I thought he was a bad fit in the first film, a little flat and certainly not commandeering enough as even a young Duke, but I actually liked him here and was sorry to see him disposed of so soon.  He and Roadblock have an easy way with each and some nice, comic moments together.  I didn't think that his inclusion would enhance the film and I was wrong.  (*END*SPOILER*ALERT)<br /><br />As for whether or not you'll see your favorite Joe or Cobra baddie that depends: Firefly rocks this film!  Zartan (playing the President) is the main baddie and he has a little fun with it.  Lady Jaye (very fetching in a red evening gown; played by actress Adrianne Palicki) and Flint are the other two main Joes that comprise the team and follow Roadblocks command.  Mouse shows up nimbly, and of course there's Cobra Commander but not much is made of him though so much happens because of him.  Unless you're extremely well versed in Joe lore you'll miss the few others herein but you will miss Scarlett, Destro, the Baroness, Hawk, and more as they're not here (or, in Destro's case, you won't hear from him).  The bottom line is that if you dig on Snakes, Stormy, Roadblock, Lady Jaye, and Willis' new turn you'll still be happy even if your favorite Joe doesn't make the roster call.<br /><br />So let's get down to the flint of it.  This movie is a fun booming action fest with plenty of hand-to-hand/ close quarters combat as well as firefights and big explosions galore that satisfies the popcorn muncher inside of me.  And that's the reason to see this slice of the Joe pie.  The formula of a small, tight band of militarized heroes with their backs up against the proverbial wall facing seemingly impossible odds is a winner that's justwritten into our DNA.  (No you won't be wrapped up in an intriguing potboiler twisty turny hard to follow story but it may surprise you as to how it takes its time to unfold; the story is simple--and simply revealed in the trailer I'm afraid.)  The action and the military technologies/ hardware are more grounded for the most part as is the overall tone of this film; largely, though not completely, gone are the fantastical elements from \\"The Rise of Cobra\\" thus giving \\"Retaliation\\" more gravity.  It's a much tighter script and storyline this time around.<br /><br />So in the end was the wait of delay worth it?  If they originally didn't have any scenes with Channing Tatum then I will say that, yes, the delay was worth it as his scenes bring us in quickly to caring for our heroes.  Does the movie deliver the goods?  If you're an action hound you should be pleased.  Is it better than \\"The Rise of Cobra\\"?  Roger that, hoo-rah!<br /><br />[My last couple of comments have to do with the 3-D and some of the scene compositions/ blocking, especially early in the film.  Yes the 3-D enhances the movie but not too much and there are a couple of scenes that show a noticeable downgrade that made me wonder if they missed something in the makeover; I would suggest that you don't really lose anything seeing this movie in the regular format.  As far as the scene compositions/ blocking goes, there are several points when we are given a POV of looking over a person's shoulder or around a person, where their silhouette takes up a good portion of the screen, and this is distracting to the point where you will want to yell at them to get out of the way!  A minor gripe but a gripe nonetheless.]written into our DNA.

B001HN690O|4.0|My review's going to take a little bit of a different direction so please, bear (get it?) with me.<br /><br />Adoption usually gets some bad press in movies; if something goes horribly wrong or some person has an annoying tendency it might just be because they're adopted.  Adoption also is the butt of some admittedly funny jokes here and there but the driving point is still that there is something \\"wrong\\" with the adopted person and so adoption, no matter how noble, is an ultimately doomed endeavor.<br /><br />How frustrating to the hundreds of thousands, millions even, of people who have adopted or been adopted and who are loved and loving.  Adopted or not we all have our faults.  So it is always refreshing to see a movie that doesn't just have a positive spin on adoption but whose adoption plot is an important feature of the movie.  And that's something that we have in Kung Fu Panda 2.  The somewhat dim Po, the lovable titular Panda voiced by Jack Black, is feeling the distance between he and his father goose (yes, literally his father is a goose for those of you who haven't seen this film).  Po loves and is loved by his dad, but he has questions about where he came from and what his biological parents were like and why they couldn't or didn't keep him.  These questions are answered over story's course and the villain this time around, a peacock (voiced by Gary Oldman) whose hidden blades and secrets of gunpoweder are far worse than his bite...er, peck, figures strongly into Po's biological backstory.<br /><br />The violence and some of the heavier emotional tones make this a movie that perhaps is not a great fit for those under 6 although they would be pleased with it visually.  The heavier tones can be felt throughout with the darker color palettes chosen; there are ominous skies filled with dark billious smoke throughout and our heroes often find themselves operating in the twilight and nighttime hours where deep reds and oranges, and darker purples and shades of black abound.  This contrasts significantly with the first feature with its light and sun-soaked qualities.  Also this time around the humor is more forced and it's not quite as funny but I never found the first feature to be a laugh-fest mind you, just a movie that constantly put a smile on my face that stayed there for long periods of time.  By contrast this movie has more \\"funny\\" moments and one-liners, and Michelle Yeoh's character Soothsayer the goat has some of the funniest moments with her calm precognitive knowing which constantly upsets our bad peacock.<br /><br />Overall this is a movie that could be a family favorite.  While I feel that it is inferior to the first on many levels it does possess the purposeful element of using Po's adoption as a bright and important story vehicle that maintains a positive message, and that's something that I truly appreciate.of black abound.

Since it was made for TV, I expected little difference, but they did a great job of cleaning up the film for blu-ray.<br /><br />As far as the story, it's a fantastic one that I've watched many, many times, and enjoyed it every time.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My son saved his money for this and was not disappointed! Lots of detail!  It's fragile though and heavy.  Handle with care!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln is a very good film. One of the best political/historical dramas I've seen. I went to see the film expecting to enjoy it, and I did enjoy it, even more than I thought I would. The second viewing was even better, as I was more able to understand the intricacies of the dialogue and plot. It has enough complexity to keep \\"bearing fruit\\" in multiple viewings, which I see as a mark of a very good film. At first I wanted to protest the title, because it focuses only on the one-month work of passing the 13th amendment. The book it is based on, \\"Team of Rivals\\" is a fantastic book, and covers MUCH more ground. However,the more I thought about it the more I saw that it is still a fitting title. I could see trying to film the whole book would have been a monstrosity. Better to do a small part well, than the whole poorly. The film presents the passage of the 13th amendment as the \\"crowning achievement\\" of Lincoln's presidency, and in a sense the fulfillment of his life purpose. Everything that went before leads up to and prepares for that accomplishment. The producers/director sought to capture the essence of Lincoln in a specific struggle of the hard, painful, and strange work of mixing ideology and politics.<br /><br />As others have written so well, the portrayal of the civil war period is engrossing. It is beautifully done, and so believable that it draws you into the world and you think you are interacting with real history in real places. I was thoroughly taken in with the portrayal of Lincoln's full humanity: his humility, simplicity, awkwardness, humor, pithiness, vision, love of family, and, surprising to me, his mostly controlled anger. Most significantly it displays his love of the American ideal that lies just beyond our reach, but beckons us to strive for it with all our might.<br /><br />I thought the film does a good job of portraying both Lincoln's strengths and weaknesses. Not only does it detail the criticisms of his deepest opponents, true to what somany people admire about Lincoln, it also shows Lincoln agreeing with his critics and giving even deeper self-criticism as he wrestles with the conflict of coming to \\"firmness in the right as God enables us to see the right.\\" The stories, and the varied responses to his endless stories, seemed so true to what history tells us. I understand that much of the South despised him. It's impossible to be great without people despising it. But Lincoln's humble self-deprecation in standing firm on his principles, while pointing out the best in his opponents, must make it hard to be comfortable hating him.<br /><br />The acting was superb. Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed Lincoln as well as I can imagine it being done, which I thought would be exceedingly difficult because of Lincoln's iconic (actually \\"marble like\\") status. Tommy Lee Jones was very good. Ann Hathaway was good in Les Mis., but Sally Field was better in portraying the complex character of Mary Todd Lincoln, somehow bringing out the \\"insane\\" Mrs. Lincoln in the context of pride, love, devotion, and not quite enough tact.<br /><br />I'm not sure what to say about the soundtrack. It is a great soundtrack on its own, but plays very little role (too little?) in the film. Its clear that Spielberg did not want to overshadow Lincoln, because Lincoln does need much support, and Day-Lewis' performance is up to the task.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love zombie flicks, and more recently books, and this one did not disappoint. I liked the different angles, the notes, and the characters. I mainly picked this up because I liked the preview for the movie. Now that I hear the movie takes a different angle, I look forward to not falling into the \\"movie really butchered it\\" pit of despair.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is amazingly fun!! I don't even think that is a word all i know is this game is fun and I'm very happy that I downloaded it.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|The game downloaded and installed quite well on my Kindle Fire HD 7\\". However, that's the end of the good news. There are no instructions on how to use the controls and they are almost useless, even on low sensitivity setting. The graphics and music are somber but not at all scary. Even as FAOTD this game is overpriced.BTW, I would love to know who bas been writing all the 5 star reviews.
0307887898|4.0|Very well thought out and uncomplicated book. I do not know how much of what he says will actually work when put into real world play but I do like the context and will keep this book for my shelf for later use as I grow my business.

0345803485|5.0|I know this series of books is not for everyone but if you can get past the graphic sex, there is an awesome story there.  Christian is very damaged but once he meets Anastasia, he begins to change.  Because Anasatasia is so innocent, he begns to rethink his choices and although his attempt to woo her is over the top and his controlling demeanor nearly costs him everything, in the end he realizes that her love means the world to him.  I've read some other ratings that trashed the series but every female I know who has read the books has loved them and we all look forward to a possible movie.
B00A8OBSX6|5.0|In critiquing this recording, I am going to compare Cencic to Jaroussky, the latter being the best counter tenor at present, in my always humble opinion. Few singers are \\"all-round\\" and can sing in every style that they may wish to or that is presented to them by seemingly intelligent recording label producers and managers (who mainly care about their 15-25% commission).<br /><br />Let me be clear here. What I will be discussing are subtle nuances between great artists. Readers who will not wax indignant at my saying that - solely in my opinion to avoid being sued - Andrea Bocelli, Susan Boyle and Katherine Jenkins are singers for musical simpletons will understand what I am talking about. Those who wax indignant at this point should not read on.<br /><br />I have been following counter tenors since the time of the great Paul Eswood, and very, very few of them were \\"all-round.\\" In fact, the only one I can think of is David Daniels, who is as fabulous in baroque repertoire as he is in 20th century song literature.<br /><br />Having listened carefully to this recording and others before, I will venture to say that Jaroussky is more \\"all round\\" than Cencic at present. That's not to say that Jaroussky doesn't have his foibles, such as the \\"Melodies francaises\\" album which was just totally wrong for him. Cencic is definitely a fantastic counter tenor, but his repertoire fortes are, at least currently, still somewhat more limited than Jaroussky's. I do not recall hearing Jaroussky sing baroque repertoire where I was less than convinced that it was well within the grasp of his vocal technique as well as his musical intelligence. Sometimes, Cencic leaves me in a quandary.<br /><br />Cencic's technique is quite impressive, but first of all, one (and that includes Cencic's vocal coach) should realize that Cencic's tessitura is fundamentally lower than Jaroussky's. Cencic is a fine mezzo castrato voice with a strong top, whereas Jaroussky is a genuine soprano castrato voice. No matter how much Cencic struggles to become a soprano castrato, it is not something he's going to succeed at, so he may as well stay within his comfortable mezzo confines. There are plenty of fine roles for that range, it won't strain him in his passaggio and he'll still sound better than Cecilia Bartoli when she sings baroque repertoire.<br /><br />Taking the arias one by one on this album illustrates my points while I provide some commentary on the orchestra as well. The violins are a bit sloppy in Caldara's \\"Barbaro non comprendo.\\" This aria illustrates perfectly that Cencic needs repertoire chosen more carefully since, perhaps imitating the violins here, he gets muddled up by passaggio transitions that cross from his chest to head voice in a range which Jaroussky is quite comfortable in.<br /><br />Porta's Mormorando quelle fronde is a jewel of a slow, lyrical aria. It has an absolutely delightful accompaniment in the orchestra with two violins obbligato and pizzicato bass to support the singer. More from this composer please! Cencic sounds splendid in the high tessituras in this aria as it is a slow cantabile which his voice can easily sustain.<br /><br />In Vivaldi's \\"A' piedi miei sventato\\" Cencic is somewhat uneven in the scale passages, probably because they lie within the transitions of his tessitura. His opening in chest voice is magnificent and it's only when he tries to traverse the difference between the peaks and bottoms of this demanding aria that his voice is stretched. The orchestra sounds great here, with a bit of Spinosian \\"Bartoque\\" bow attacca in the basses and great spiccato passages in the violins.<br /><br />Gasparini's \\"Dolce mio ben, mia vita\\" is beautifully sung and played, but the music is rather pedestrian. Dare I say that Gasparini is a B-composer since he's dead and I can't offend him? I have been chided  before for calling Kermes a B-aroque soprano and have promised not to do that again to sensitive artists who might read what I write. Since Gasparini is long dead, I trust that I offend no one.<br /><br />In Vivaldi's \\"Anche in mezzo e perigliosa\\" Cencic shows off his extensive range, which, in this particular aria, is better balanced from one tessitura to the other than Bartoli's voice in her Vivaldi album. Here the fast passaggi lie in ranges that fit Cencic's voice perfectly, and he performs this difficult aria beautifully.<br /><br />Giacomelli's \\"Sposa...non mi conosci\\" is a \\"tragic\\" affect aria which, in Cencic's deep voice, is profoundly moving. It has some great passages for the strings with suspensions that make the listener's skin crawl (well...at least mine). A great slow aria to just enjoy with a glass of properly decanted Cote-Rotie '76 - the aria is almost 10 minutes long and allows for some nice swirling and slow sipping.<br /><br />Vivaldi's \\"Io son rea dell'onor mio\\" once again presents some slightly sloppy violin playing and demonstrates that Vivaldi's writing for the voices he had at his disposal doesn't suit Cencic as well as some other composers' arias.<br /><br />Albinoni's \\"Pianta bella, pianta amata\\" is one of the composer's signature beautifully written slow movements which, like in his concerti grossi and oboe concerti, one can tell right off the bat is the stuff in which this composer excels beyond any other of his time, except perhaps Bach. A solo violin obbligato and the basso continuo frame the beautiful melodic line presented by the voice. The balance is not ideal, though, since the violin and basso continuo are slightly too loud relative to the voice. The aria is ideal for Cencic's tessitura though, and he shows off an impeccable skill at ornamenting the reprise of the A section.<br /><br />Vivaldi's \\"Mi vuoi trader, lo so\\" has technical challenges which make Cencic's voice sound a bit hysterical. That is, of course, the affect that the aria expresses. Still, I do not say \\"hysterical\\" in an affected sense but rather as a reserved opinion that the solist goes a bit overboard in his vocal emotiveness.<br /><br />In the following \\"Quel rossor che in volto miri\\" by the same composer, the orchestral accompaniment is delectably delicate and the aria suits Cencic well. The only thing I'd correct if I were his vocal coach is that his dynamics consist of mezzo forte to forte. In other words, more subtlety is called for regardless of the beauty of the voice. At least in most of this da capo aria, since Cencic seems able to sing mezzo piano just before the B section and in the B section. Of course the whole thing may just be a matter of my turning the volume down a bit.<br /><br />Selitto's \\"Anche un misero arboscello\\" is the stylistically most modern aria on this CD. The composer - whose name is unknown to me - happily uses a trommelbass to support the melody in a thoroughly Neapolitan and Milanese fashion. No doubt it was very shocking in Venice at the time, but it does help to emphasize the soloist, as Gluck found out to his substantial profit. Cencic is impeccable in this aria, as is the orchestra. Cencic's cadenza at the end is quite impressive.<br /><br />This recording shows off how different the Venetian and Neapolitan styles were in the first half of the 18th century. It also shows the difference between Cencic and Jaroussky. If I had any say (which I don't) I'd recommend to Cencic's managers and producers that they choose his roles and recordings very carefully. If they do, he will easily achieve Jaroussky's heights of vocal beauty, albeit in a different vocal range.<br /><br />My quibbles are of an entirely technical nature, and if I were not listening with a critically tuned ear I would say that this CD scores an easy 5 stars.te.

B008OOYALE|4.0|I have become addicted to Dragon Story, but there are a few things id like to see changed. First I hate how the android version is different from the iphone one. If you start with the latter, then get it on a Kindle, you miss all the things you had. The second thing I dislike, which goes for all team lavas games is that you make a storm id on the device for that particular game, but then can never use it again. When I reset my Kindle I had to start from scratch on this game because I couldn't access my storm id. So team lava should think about these things.<br />overall though, I love this game and will continue to play it, and would definitely say it is a game for all ages!
B004ZN9R6G|2.0|I've been an unabashed fan of Pink Floyd for the last forty years. I own virtually all of their catalog, including their solo efforts. Having said this, I can say with complete candor that I would rather jam ice picks in my ears than listen to this album one more time. it has all the markings of a term paper suddenly remembered the night before it was due. It seems rushed, unfocused and listless. The only redeeming grace is Water's \\"Free Four\\" which gives us an early glimpse of him dealing with the loss of his father. Also, \\"Wot's ...Uh the Deal\\" has some nice moments in it. Unless you're dead set on completing your collection you might want to back slowly away from this one.
0307341577|4.0|I'm giving this book 4 stars because it was very well written. A part of me wants to give it 3 because I wasn't crazy about how she ended it. I'm confused as to who the bad guys were (aside from the obvious murderers). Maybe that was her point? I felt the same about Gone Girl, although I really felt she rushed that ending much more. I did enjoy the flashback style of writing. She is a very talented writer; I'm feeling unfulfilled at the end of her books though.

B00BDZV9M4|1.0|This album is by far Waynes worst. Hes not trying anymore. Not even worth the space on a hard drive if you got the album for free. Its over Tunuchi or whatever you call yourself now days. Just stick to pretending to skateboard and designing skinny jeans and cheetah underwear.
B00B9366VO|4.0|I would give Sound City 3.5/5 stars if given the choice - Grohl's enthusiasm for the subject is readily apparent while his newness to directing films slightly less so.
B0014BY72Q|4.0|The older I get and the more my body fights me.....the more I talk about this movie and what it represents.  There isn't any fantastic acting and NO it is not or was not Oscar material but the times it has come on tv, I have always tried to watch it.  Never really cared for the television series....guess the movie is the one that caught my heart and mind.  Saw it when I was younger than &#34;30&#34; and now that I am 62 going on 63...I keep waiting for the button in my hand to start flashing.  ahaha

B002SSBD6W|5.0|I've been toying with vegetarianism for a few years now.  It's hard for me, because I don't think that eating meat is necessarily morally wrong.  I just don't trust our food anymore, or our governments representations about our food.  I thought I had read and seen enough, and I wasn't sure what I would learn knew from Eating Animals.  After all, I have watched Fast Food Nation, Food, Inc., Fat Sick and Nearly Dead, Forks Over Knives, Vegucated, etc.  But reading this book is a journey, and I enjoyed JSF's thoughts and reflections, the thought provoking questions he poses, the insights from others in the industry -- especially the manner in which those insights are interspersed throughout the book.  And, I finished the book even more freaked out about factory farming than I was before.  And I knew NOTHING about what happens to fish!<br /><br />(JSF really is a great writer, and his voice come through, and makes a difference here.  Sometimes, the way you tell a story matters.  The way he asks the questions is memorable and effective.  I remember being similarly blown away by Everything is Illuminated.)<br /><br />The book was worth the $10 I paid.  I actually wish I had bought a paper copy instead of a Kindle version, to make it easier to got through the sources at the end.  (This kind of book always inspires me to do my own research.)<br /><br />I don't enjoy cooking, not even remotely, so not a single one of those documentaries, of any of the half dozen books I had already read managed to convince me that I would actually enjoy a vegetarian diet, or that eating meat, now matter how safely and sustainably it was produced, is just plain wrong. This book didn't do that either. I do think that humans are omnivores. But our consciences should make us ask questions about what we do and why, and for what purpose. For that reason, this book was enlightening, inspiring, interesting, educational, etc.  And I HIGHLY recommend it.

B00BESLHEA|1.0|I expected a somewhat better story. The entire movie had in my opinion not much of a story at all. At times I found myself completely lost. I don't believe that others enjoyed this move.<br />What can I say, I didn't like it at all!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game! I just can't stop playing it. I play it so much that my friends say I have an addiction! This game is so worth the seven bucks.
B005H9B44A|1.0|Disappointed.  Love The Avengers.  Loved the Batman movies.  So it's not the whole sci fi thing that I dislike. But this movie is boring, predictable, and the CGI is not very good.  It's not believable enough. I \\"rented\\" it free through Amazon prime, but I wish I had not wasted the 2 hours to watch it.  Don't bother.  Watch something else.

B00B2166BS|5.0|I bought this because I am a heavy user of my Nexus 10. The factory charger worked OK but took about 7 hours to go from 0% to 100%. This charges in about half that time. Just for reference I got about 900 mAH from the factory charger. I get about 1900 mAH with this charger.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It's been decades since I first read Hugo's work, but I think I'm enjoying it even more this time around. Hugo  constructs both scene and mood with great patience, so that the reader is fully absorbed into the setting.  Characters are likewise described with such complete attention to details of appearance and personality that we feel we know them.  The writing is, of course, dated, and filled with antiquated usage; but Kindle clears up most issues with definitions and, in some cases, footnotes.  Maybe that's why I'm enjoying the book more this time.  : )
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|We follow that same myths and only see perversity of others. The hero hallways sees true while overt seekers of truth are locked in their inability to see our universal blind spots unknowable since that is our paradox
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It's an okay game, I mean, I've seen games like it before. This one has its own feel that is good but, still like the others. It's good but, predictable.
B00B9LNJ9I|3.0|Dido's original strength as an artist came from the rich, intense atmosphere of her music coupled with the pain and self-reflection in her lyrics. As someone who loved Dido's first two albums and was disappointed with her third, I was excited to learn that Dido was finally releasing a fourth album, and I had high hopes that the generally poor reception that Safe Trip Home received would drive her back to the spectacular, lush sounds of No Angel and Life For Rent.  Girl Who Got Away is a partial retreat, not altogether disappointing but not entirely satisfying.<br /><br />The good news is that Dido has indeed returned to electronica, which immediately elevates this album over Safe Trip Home's dreary, flat presentation. End Of Night and Let's Runaway are joys to listen to, with audio depth and complexity that complement Dido's fragile voice. No Freedom could easily have been a song originally intended for No Angel, and Let Us Move On and All I See would fit comfortably among the songs contained on Life For Rent.  This isn't to suggest that they are mere replicas of earlier songs, but that they are interesting enough to earn a place among those songs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Love To Blame and Lost sound a bit too much like sleepy cast-offs from Safe Trip Home, and songs like Girl Who Got Away, Go Dreaming, and Just Say Yes never quite reach their potential. Several of the songs on the album sound as though they are unfinished and were created purely to pass along to DJs to round out through remixes.  Many of the songs lack an audio anchor and contain the hint of a build-up without ever offering a release.  They are safe songs that float along and are begging to be completed by EDM wizards in a musical laboratory.  While this may appeal to those seeking a lighter sound, and may make the eventual remixes fun, it leaves at least part of the album feeling hollow and unsatisfying to those of us who prefer the more intense and experimental sound of her first two albums.<br/><br />In short, Dido has returned to her electronica roots but for the most part has opted for a softer, less urgent, and therefore less interesting sound than that which marked the brilliant beginnings of her career.  Putting this album on repeat will be a far more enjoyable experience than was the case with Safe Trip Home; it just won't be quite the Dido experience I had been hoping for.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Great read.! Loved this book.! Intense and captivating.  A wonderful thriller.  Looking forward to reading some more by this author.
B005H29GSI|4.0|My soon-to-be-four-year-old Son is crazy about ANGRY BIRDS, so when we get a game like ON THIN ICE, it's mainly for the bird and pig figures. He doesn't have any real interest in the game itself, aside from building \\"Pig Castles\\" and \\"Launching Birds\\"....The Pigs included with this game are not the same soft rubber as the ones in later games. They're made of a hard plastic, and their faces are printed on a sticker. This game does include a break-away box of Dynamite, which is a pretty cute little extra. Your little ANGRY BIRD fan will probably have a ball with this game.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I bought this game three days ago and I am totally addicted. I could sit and play for hours. I got my whole family addicted too.
0765325950|5.0|It is hard to believe I have been reading this series for about 25 years. But I still remember where I was when I started reading the first book. I loved reading about Emond's Field, and reading about Matt, Egwene, Rand, Perrin, and Nynaeve (whose name I still don't know how to say).<br /><br />Many of the books in this series really dragged but this finally book in the series made up for it. It was the most epic battle I have ever read in a book. Almost all of its 900 pages describe one huge battle.<br /><br />(Tiny spoiler alert here--->) Being a Christian, I also appreciated the fact that Rand turned out be a Messianic figure, knowing that the only way to deliver the world from the Dark One was through his own death.<br /><br />For anybody who likes fantasy novels, this series ranks in my top five series, though I doubt I will ever read it again, simply because of the sheer number of volumes in the series.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Just a Marvel-ous movie!!!  All the characters from the previous Marvel super-hero movies, plus a couple of new additions.  We're waiting for the sequel with bated breath!

B006ZS81GG|5.0|I am totally in love with Lana's voice.  She is gorgeous, her voice is reminiscent of the 50s and so amazing!  Her subject is generally good girl gone very bad so do not listen to around kids!  This is the music you crank in your car after the kids are in school and you need to de-stress!  P.S. Her videos are great too!

If you really want to get a good feel for them, you have to youtube their live performances at the LC in Columbus.  They are wonderful!  I can only hope my kids prefer these guys to Katie Perry (shudder!).
B000N3ST7A|5.0|A very short while ago I was watching a YouTube video of Jesse Stone's performance of the classic Dusty Springfield \\"Son of a Preacher Man\\"  from the UK Music Hall of Fame on 14/11/06.  Excellent video and performance (too bad it is not on an album), but what got me was one of the blog commentaries below the video.  It seems some young man (maybe not) was very expressly expressing his feelings about Joss Stone:<br />\\"i would drag my balls through a mile of glass just to hear her fart through a walkie talkie\\".  Now THAT my friends is some kind of devotion!<br /><br />I have felt that way myself in the day.  That is expressly (again) how I felt about Stevie Nicks in 1975 and for many years afterwards!  I was one of the very first rabid young men drooling, no slavering!, all over the rather non-descript but strange black & white album (see my review) FLEETWOOD MAC.  You see, I had courted Fleetwood Mac for a few years and the last outing I had with them was this colorful almost comic-booky album Mystery To Me, with Bob Welch and Christine on lead vocal duties.  An extraordinary album in its own merits.  Now, very quickly, friends of friends of Fleetwood Mac were passing on in whispers this totally \\"new\\" sound and these magical songs would enslave you forever to the group!  Well darlin', they were not kidding!  And it wasn't too hard to figure out what the \\"new\\" sound meant and credits and Rolling Stone album reviews divulged that secret readily and bunches of us testosterone brimming boys went a-huntin' for that sexy looking Buckingham-Nicks album in droves!<br /><br />Yeah, Yeah, Lindsey is cool, he's the cat's meow, but this here chick, Stevie freakin' Nicks!  She can SING!  Everyone says it nowadays like they just invented it or something, but us Heads back in the day were saying Stevie Nicks can sing the freakin' Phone Book and it would sell millions!  So boys and girls, that is how the general public discovered Stevie Nicks in 1975 and how a \\"discontinued\\" 1973 album on the Polydor label (BUCKINGHAM NICKS) sold out of back copies within a few months of the Fleetwood Mac appearance of Stevie and Lindsey.  Incidentally, BUCKINGHAM NICKS has yet to be released on CD (oh there are some very poor quality bootlegs out there) and if you do a simple search on Google you will find a huge petition to sign to get the label owner to release it!<br /><br />Stevie grew up from a very early age playing and singing along with her grandfather's music (a struggling country music professional) and in her teen years she learned how to belt out a Janis Joplin tune like the goddess herself.  In high school, she and her new boyfriend (Lindsey Buckingham) formed a band and they actually opened for Janis (and Jimi Hendrix too) in the San Francisco Bay area.  The two went to college but dropped out to keep playing their music and were signed to Polydor in '72.  It is almost legendary now, how they were discovered by Mick Fleetwood and literally invited to join without an audition, a package deal to replace the now departed Bob Welch, and the result is rock history of the highest order.  A group as beloved as, and with all the internal turmoil and struggle of, The Beatles themselves.  Stevie became an icon of rock females in only 5 years, her dedication to her music, to Fleetwood Mac, and to us, the audience, got her labeled by Rolling Stone as The Reigning Queen Of Rock & Roll.  She has continued that devotion to her music, the group, and to us, for over 35 years.  She is also (according to Rolling Stone) one of the \\"100 Greatest Singers Of All Time\\".  She has received 13 Grammy Award nominations (8 solo, 5 with Fleetwood Mac resulting in Best Album Award), and has received the Grammy Hall Of Fame Award (2003) and been inducted along with Fleetwood Mac into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ('98).  Stevie has had her share of trials and tribulations, who in her world doesn't?  She is not a home-wrecker, not a witch, and not a bad role model either.  Stevie Nicks is a genuine article, gentle lady, loving and giving, and has a unique voice and talent for musical arrangement that is impossible to mimic or reproduce.  She will be sorely missed by many if and when she retires from the microphone.<br /><br />It's been a very very long time since Stevie kept her visions to herself.  CRYSTAL VISIONS THE VERY BEST OF STEVIE NICKS is an excellent time capsule for those of you who are fans and have vinyl but not resources to replace it all, all the way back to Bella Donna.  Yes there are songs you will miss, so go buy the mp3 as a supplement.  This CD is almost full to maximum capacity (shy by 1 and a half minute) with the best she had to offer us spanning 6 solo albums in 20 years (1981 - 2001), an unreleased Fleetwood Mac single intended for RUMOURS (1977), a 2005 collaboration with Deep Dish (re-recording a dub-mix of Dreams), and two live recordings with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and a live performance of Led Zeppelin's Rock & Roll (also 2005).  The result of this welcomingly long CD is a terrific testament to the STILL Reigning Queen of Rock & Roll, which just leaves you salivating for more.  If you are not afraid your budget cannot handle it, go ahead!  Buy all (7 now) studio albums and even the Sound Stage Sessions Live album.  You will still be missing 6 (more than one third of this album) tracks which are unavailable anywhere else, which means you will be coming back to this eventually anyway.  Yeah Hah ha ha!  She Got You!  I guess she IS a witch after all!<br /><br />Seriously folks, this album is a real gem, a real Crystal Vision.  I even even love how the album is bookended by two versions of her anthem Edge Of 17, the final track being a killer live performance that you want to never end.  The only slight misgiving I have with it is the volume.  I dislike the \\"loudness wars\\" and this one is pretty up there, but I have not noticed any loss in high or low signal, and no noise, I just have to turn down the volume when going from one album to this one (or when a song pops up on random play).  I cannot give Miss Nicks any lower than a Perfect 10 for this effort, she usually is a Perfect 10.  Let's face it, she may not be a witch, but Stevie Nicks is an Enchantress.  \\"it's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams, have you any dreams you'd like to sell?\\"e Nicks is a genuine article, gentle lady, loving and giving, and has a unique voice and talent for musical arrangement that is impossible to mimic or reproduce.

B00000373U|5.0|Item arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />As for the album, its incredible. I have yet to hear an Elliott Smith album I didn't like, but Either/Or sticks out as one of his more signature records. He played with a lot of different sounds throughout his career, but Either/Or, in my opinion, dons a sound that is uniquely his.<br /><br />May you enjoy this album as much as I have.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I originally saw the movie at the theatre so I wanted my own personal copy.  I thoroughly enjoy this movie.  I am a fan of Judi Dench.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read some bad reviews for this book but after the first two I was far too hooked to stop. This book outdid my expectations. The author magically continues to carry you throughout the world of panem and the hunger games like revealing a well kept secret. My emotions were charged even greater than the first two books after forming a connection to these characters. I was intrigued, frustrated, confused, relieved, excited, angry... and elated at a (for me) perfect ending. If you read the first two books you must read mockingjay!

B00821OX98|5.0|If you like The Walking Dead (maybe without all of the gore) and Terminator, you'll probably like this. Most episodes have a good amount of action, the special effects are well done and, gasp, there is even some character development! While there are bits of predictable storyline and typecast characters, it is very entertaining. Who doesn't like the idea of a band of rebels defending their territory from invaders (you an draw your parallels from 18th century USA history). It's not Battlestar Galactica type epic, yet, but it fulfills my scifi needs for the time being.

B00BUL0XYG|5.0|the only song which resembles the \\"old Strokes\\" is \\"All the Time\\" and MAYBE \\"50/50\\". All other songs sound like 80's music, with the exception of the last one, which I don't know exactly what it sounds like. The album opens sending the message right away, since Tap Out has 80's \\"written\\" in every beat and riff. Julian is singing in high pitch a lot, sometimes sounding like a woman. The songs are very \\"elaborated\\", with more than the basic rhythm/lead guitars that were so typical of them in the first 3 albums. The best songs: Tap Out, Welcome to Japan, and Call it fate Call it Karma. Other very good ones: Slow Animals, Chances, All the time, One way Trigger and Partners in Crime. Good but not great: 50/50, 80's Comedown machine and Happy Ending.

Now the mix-up was probably my fault in the beginning, but when I requested a copy in English and sent the Spanish one back, I was shipped yet another copy in Spanish! Needless to say I was disappointed and just sent both back with the request to have my credit card reimbursed. On a good note I did receive the refund rather quickly.

015206396X|5.0|If you combined King Arthur's mysticism with the most exciting, realistic parts of Lord of the Rings, you would get Graceling, by Kristin Cashore. A new fantasy world complete with the Graced, or people born with special abilities, this book pulls you in from the very first page.<br /><br />In the land of seven kingdoms run by seven very different kings, there are people called Gracelings. Gracelings are Graced with an ability. All Gracelings, once they are identified, become property of the Kings. If their Grace is useful to the King, they are kept and used for the Kingdom (special fighting ability, mind reading, controlling the weather, etc.). If it is a useless Grace (ability to swim, dancing, etc.), they are returned to their parents. Katsa, King Randa of Middluns's niece, has been most useful to his forceful control over his kingdom thanks to her Grace for Killing. Even though Katsa is under the King's control and carries out most of his dirty work, she still refuses to allow the people of any kingdom to suffer, and she formed the Council to fight against injustice. It was the secret Council work that led Katsa to Murgon City in Sunder to rescue Tealiff, the father of Lienid's King Ror. As she did so, however, she came across a very interesting Lienid Graceling, Prince Po.<br /><br />Po knows Katsa rescued his grandfather, and together they set off to get to the bottom of his kidnapping. This journey leads Katsa to the truth behind her Grace, Po's Grace, and the very dangerous Grace of King Leck of Monsea. Katsa also comes to the conclusion that Po is more than the other men she has known. Po could be the one man she could trust enough to love, but will he be interested in a woman who never wants to marry or have children?<br /><br />This is a captivating story. Everything from the world of the seven kingdoms, to the different kings and how they run their kingdoms, to the Gracelings makes this story phenomenal. This is a fantasy with just enough realism to keep both feet on the ground and just enough mysticism to entice the fantasy-minded readers. The characters are dynamic, and Katsa and Po worm their way into your heart immediately.<br /><br />Graceling has a strong story that can be a little mature and complicated at times. It might be best saved for grades 9-12, and while the protagonist is female, the story would appeal to both male and female students. There is some violence and a few brief pages of intimacy, but the majority of the story is appropriate for all ages. It is beautifully written, and almost seems poetic at times. If you need a beautiful story in a beautiful and harsh world, Graceling is your story!both feet on the ground and just enough mysticism to entice the fantasy-minded readers.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have always struggled in the gym, just confused about what to do and what are the effective ways of working out. But this book changed all that, I have been very focused and well informed now. Following this book has given me the tools I need to loose fat and build muscles. The beauty of this book is that it makes everything easy to follow and tells me exactly where to begin and what to do to get best results.

1583334386|5.0|Unlike most books focused on achieving goals, this book does not at all rely on the flowery, motivational speaker type encouragements that have come to typify the genre.  This is a book that convinces with science as opposed to attempting to motivate through inspiration.  McGonigal incorporates many references to scientific studies and then she makes suggestions about how to apply this knowledge toward aligning one's rational desires with one's actions.  What makes this a 5 star book instead of a 4 star book is that the author manages to pack in all this useful, factual information while still being engaging and at times humorous.  If you are a person who is convinced more through appeals to logic and reason than by emotional, inspirational appeals, then this is the willpower book for you.  Even if you are more of the second type, this book can be a useful supplement.  Highly recommended.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The other reviews say it all. What I love about this app is that it does exactly what it says. The battery indicator is there when I switch my kindle on so I know if I need to charge it or not. Great app that I would highly recommend!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought this pacifier for my son before he was born. I took it with me to the hospital when I went into labor. The child was attached to it as soon we offered it to him. It's easy to find and you can just throw it in the washer. I ordered him similar ones it but he prefers this on.  He's four and half months now and this is the second one I buy him.
0545123283|4.0|Who said a sequel can't be better? If so, they clearly haven't read Maggie Stiefvater's Linger, a sequel to her werewolf bestseller, Shiver. This story not only makes me like the first book better, it makes me want to move to Minnesota! Now I have never been to Minnesota, so please excuse the judgment, but it takes quite an author to convince me to move to the tundra!<br /><br />Where the first book was told from the perspective of Sam, the werewolf, and Grace, the average good girl, Linger is told from four different perspectives: Sam, Grace, their friend Isabel (whose new wolf brother died in the last book), and Cole, a new wolf who was specially chosen to be turned by Beck, Sam's adoptive father. Last season, when it looked like Sam and Beck weren't going to change back into humans anymore, Beck made sure there would be new wolves to take over the pack. Sam's cure worked, though, and he is no longer shifting; he got his wish to permanently stay a human and be with Grace as much as possible.<br /><br />So when two new wolves surface, Cole and Victor, Sam has to act as pack leader and take care of them. Unfortunately, something is wrong. Cole is shifting into a human too often for such cold weather, and Victor is violently shifting back and forth, without any control over either form. Things continue to go south when Grace's parents, who are no longer thrilled with her relationship with Sam, find the two of them in bed in the middle of the night. Now they don't want Grace to be around Sam, but Grace is growing weaker and sicker each and every day. With no idea what is wrong with her, but a clear idea it has something to do with the wolves, Sam, Isabel, and Cole must come together to help her.<br /><br />This was a wonderful follow up to the first book. With more characters for the first-person narrative, it can be a bit confusing at times. I sometimes found myself wondering who was talking and had to flip back a few pages to be sure of the narrator, but otherwise I liked hearing from Isabel and Cole. In Shiver, it sometimes got annoying to only hear from Grace and Sam, especially when they spent pages and pages mooning over one another. But Cole is a warped character who wants nothing more than to totally lose his human half. And Isabel is just as interesting. She blames herself for her brother's death, and she has no one she can talk to about it other than Cole. The tenuous relationship struck by these two is one you wish would blossom but are worried that both parties are just too damaged for any real trust to happen. Their sarcasm and troubled pasts keep the story interesting and give the story more impact.<br /><br />The writing is the same level as the first book, and the material is very tame, even for YA. There is very little mature content if any. The only snag a student might find with this series is its character driven nature. Any action that takes place is secondary to the character development. I find this to be its most redeeming quality, but for a struggling, insecure reader, the lack of packed action might not keep them reading. This is a great book for middle school through high school and beyond, depending on the reading strength of the student.liked hearing from Isabel and Cole.

0385737947|5.0|Holy Moses, Batman! I didn't see this one coming! The Maze Runner, by James Dashner has been talked about and recommended, but for some reason I didn't pick it up until now. maybe it was the mediocre cover? I don't know why it took me so long to pick this one up, but now I am kicking myself, that's for sure! This was butt kicking story full of exciting characters, a crazy prison-like world, and enemies of all kinds.<br /><br />The Glade is far from perfect, but the Gladers, young boys who all found themselves transported to the Glade in an elevator with no memories of who they were and how they got there, make do with what they have. Every boy works, either taking care of the animals, slaughtering, cooking, basic maintenance, building, or as runners. The Runners are the best of the best- a group of boys who leave the safety of the Glade's walls every day to explore the Maze outside for a way to escape. When Thomas wakes up in the elevator, he is the beginning of many weird things that bring life in the Glade to a new level of terror.<br /><br />Every night the walls to the Glade close to protect the boys from the horrors of the Maze, the Grievers in particular. Grievers are giant monsters that are part creature, part machine. They look like giant blobs with mechanical arms wielding saws, needles, claws, and other mechanical terrors. When Alby, the leader, and Minho, Keeper of the Runners, get stuck in the Maze just as the doors are closing, Thomas runs to help them and they all get stuck in the Maze. No boy has ever survived a night in the Maze with the Grievers. But Thomas' quick thinking and bravery keep both an injured Alby safe and allow him and Minho to kill Grievers- something the boys never thought was possible.<br /><br />When a girl, the first girl ever, comes up the elevator barely alive, the Gladers begin to suspect things are changing. When the sun disappears and the walls don't close, they know they must find an exit immediately or they Grievers will kill them one by one. But what lies outside the Glade and the Maze is something none of the boys could have expected.<br /><br />This is a GREAT book for anyone who loved the Hunger Games series and is waiting (impatiently) for Mockingjay to hit the stores. The books are very, very different dystopias, but they have the sense of excitement and fervor you can't help yourself from being sucked into. This book is so dangerous and exciting, it would be a great way to suck a student into reading. I would suggest the book for high-skilled middle schoolers to high school students. The world of the Glade is intricate, but not confusing. This is also a wonderful book for male and female readers alike.<br /><br />Even if you aren't into the recent dystopia boom that has rocked the YA genre, you should give this book a chance. It is just as good as Hunger Games, but it contains a world that stands on its own with a vengeance. The Gladers, while still trying to maintain order and live their lives, NEVER give up on the hope that they can escape the Maze. This hope is the backbone of this story and will keep you wanting more. The ending is a little abrupt and opens up so many more questions than it answers, but the sequel, The Scorch Trials, is due out in October, and I am willing to bet it will be just as powerful as the first book. So if you need some adventure and an all-consuming read, pick up The Maze Runner. You won't be sorry!ll them one by one. But what lies outside the Glade and the Maze is something none of the boys could have expected.<br /><br />This is a GREAT book for anyone who loved the Hunger Games series and is waiting (impatiently) for Mockingjay to hit the stores. The books are very, very different dystopias, but they have the sense of excitement and fervor you can't help yourself from being sucked into. This book is so dangerous and exciting, it would be a great way to suck a student into reading. I would suggest the book for high-skilled middle schoolers to high school students. The world of the Glade is intricate, but not confusing.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I give it 5  stars. I read it from cover to cover. Excited by what will happen to the characters.  Astonished by events.  I loved the colorful characters.  And this world unlike ours, filled with people unlike ours.

B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I'm a Hobbit fan but not a mega fan like most. I have been a big fan of Peter Jackson and this endeavor of making a trilogy out of the shortest LOR books seemed disappointingly an adventure to maximizing more revenue. It may be true however I thoroughly enjoyed the Hobbit may be even better than the other 3 LORs. Martin Freeman is such an accomplished actor than Elijah Wood and Sean Astin. The latter pair's scenes in previous LORs were just painful to watch. So much eye staring and close ups of them staring into each other's eyes. So even though the Hobbit was at a very slow pace it was enjoyable. I guess I like being swallowed whole into the Hobbit landscape. Peter Jackson said that was his intent to spend more time in the homes and in the company of Dwarves. The acting is of higher caliber and of course the wizard Gandalf steals any scene he walks in. I saw it at my favorite Cinerama in 3D HFR. HFR didn't reveal any costume or make up flaws like some fans exclaimed. In fact I was amazed at the detail and proficiency of the make up & costumes especially through the action scenes.<br /><br />I'm buying the Blu ray, DVD, Digital combo now because I can't wait till Christmas for Peter's excellent extended version. Ugh. Here's lining Peter's pockets. Sigh.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|War is never easy. It is a state of hostility, conflict and antagonism, a struggle between opposing forces with a definite finality goal. Most wars have been based on religion, or, acquisition. Young healthy men, inspired by multiple reasoning, have gambled that they will survive for a specified duration. The powers that be, need the muscles, the energy, the dedication, the innocence, to conquer and achieve. Their goal is to defeat the opposing force, take over, occupy and subjugate the defeated area's people.<br />War is today's form of hell. No matter how it is glorified, or romanticized, it naturally must be ruthless. The old adage always existed: Take no prisoners, leave no witnesses. This spills over to the civilian population caught in the cross-hairs.<br />Navy Seal, Adam Brown didn't know he would die that night in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan. But, he was ready. He was a man of extremes, always the first to volunteer, and his final act led to the ultimate sacrifice. He was a highly trained warrior. Troubled as a youth, his capabilities emerged after he excelled in the Navy Seal training program. This team took down Osama bin Laden.<br />The Seal Team Six Brotherhood also shows how these elite operators live out the rest if their lives as ordinary citizens.<br />The bravely fearless obey the rules superimposed by warfare. This is the story of idealism of youth, the excitement, and enthusiasm for a justified cause. The side most don't talk about is the shattered bodies and minds of those who didn't make it past the goal-post. Excellent wrap-up.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game. Lots of mini games to keep your interest. Awesome graphics and animation.  Story line is top notch too.

1250007208|4.0|Actual Rating 4.5<br /><br />The Story:<br />Cinderella was never a fairy tale I gravitated to, but Marissa Meyer created a version that I adore-- by creating a sci-fi Cinderella. Cinder isn't an exact futuristic replica of the classic but it takes some of the most known aspects (unloved stepdaughter, handsome prince, and a ball) and presents them in an unique way. Meyer gives enough background about the state of Earth and its interactions with the Lunar that you know what is going on but you are never bogged down. Though a lot of the subject matter is unhappy (prejudice, inequality, sickness) the story doesn't have a dark tone but has a hint of hope throughout. With New Beijing as the stunning backdrop, a future where relations with the Lunar (moon inhabitants) are stressed and cyborgs and androids walk the streets...what's not to love? I'll take a dash of Blade Runner with my fairy tale any day. The entire book moves at a fast pace and never failed to keep my attention. I'd set it down for a bit and always end up picking it up even if I didn't have time to read I was carrying it around everywhere I went, just in case. I have to say I knew where the story was headed but that didn't stop me from being captivated. As I got closer to the end I found myself anxious and reading faster and faster the fewer pages I had left. I can only imagine Scarlet is going to be even better.<br /><br />The Characters:<br /> Meyer creates a great cast of characters from Cinder to Iko. Cinder is strong willed and has a great sense of right and wrong. She's brave even when she's scared. I found myself getting a tad peeved at her at parts wishing she'd just fess up about certain things but since I had a good understanding of her life situation I could understand her reasoning. That brings us to our Prince, Kai is well rounded and like-able. He's young and has some lessons to learn but you have faith in who he is as a person and the decisions he'll make.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /> I had really high expectations for Cinder because of all the great reviews and buzz I've heard and I wasn't disappointed at all.had really high expectations for Cinder because of all the great reviews and buzz I've heard and I wasn't disappointed at all.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app beyond words, it is a spiritual experience! Can't get enough of this site. This is a must have!
B005F2BBLK|5.0|This Johnny Depp voiced character is a hoot starting with the name change to Rango down to the Timothy Oliphant's nod to spaghetti western veteran Clint Eastwood's gritty voice. Jam packed in between are lines of feel-good honesty about being true to yourself. Kids will laugh at the antics, but adults will love it even more!

B008CP6RWU|5.0|This is a collect of three games (plus smaller 8 bit games for free).  They are simple games, but the art work is the actual point to make.  Some of the best art in any game out there.  Journey is the best of the three games.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|How can anyone hate this movie? \\"It doesn't have any dialogue!\\" ITS A MUSICAL! Its a beautiful tale told by all beautiful actors and actresses who portray their characters which the highest regard. When it all comes together at the end its quite honestly the most beautiful scene in cinema history. I love this movie, and so should you. I highly recommend it to anyone on the fence of buying it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A dark, but ultimately satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. Leaves you with answers to most questions, but a few go answered.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and was very surprised that I did. For some reason I thought this was was younger readers and then discovered many of my friends had read it also. I was going to order the trilogy and then thought ...I'll just get the first book and see if I like it. Now I wish I had! The end of this book has left me wanting for more...will Peeta get Katniss? This book transported me into another world...another future,  yet it makes you think that this could be our world someday. It is everyone's responsibility to prevent this scenario from ever happening.
1451613512|1.0|This is one of the most anti-American books I have ever read.  All of the problems of the world are blamed on America.
B008H6GHL0|3.0|Not what I thought it was. This is amazing if you are into killer animation. Now that it has all one could ask for!!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Although I felt this film started a little slow in the development of its own story line it was of  explosive to say the least telling the story of Iran Hostage Crisis.  For me I wish they would have give a little more detail of what 'Ben Afleck's' background was before he just woke up and here we go.  All of the characters were 5-star performances and I understand completely why there were so many awards given out for this movie.<br />This will have you on the edge of your seats during the final episode worrying about what is going to happen.  It is to much of a cliff-hanger to divulge.  This is worth every cent you will spend.
B00B1MHXY2|5.0|We have had the album and the cd of Rumors since it first was recorded.  Now I have it to carry everywhere with me.
B000002I2M|5.0|The Doors \\"L.A. Woman\\" 1990 issue.<br /><br />If there is one Doors album not at least a little depressive, this isn't it. That album is Strange Days.<br />Strange Days is a moody album, and though it isn't exactly depressing, it mirrors Morrison's<br />continuous but somewhat destructive relationship with Pamela. Pamela was never Jim's wife,<br />but she was his muse. I don't know what Patricia Kennealy was to Morrison..a kind of novelty<br />because the singer became anamored with Kennealy and the occult. Plus another dimension<br />of the drug culture.<br /><br />L.A. was not really the band's home, that would be, after all of Morrison's schooling,<br />Venice Beach. L.A. was an adopted home, kind of a wild town that the band had as it's formative<br />days. The songs contained in L.A. Woman are about that town and the wild times that ensued. Paul<br />had a full time job keeping Morrison on schedule, There were seven studio albums starting<br />1969, plus several live. The album of poems was written by Jim Morrison and backed up by the band.<br /><br />Despite being intoxicated often(I can relate) Morrison was in touch with the Los Angeles<br />environment. He also knew how to set fire to his audiences in the local club. Based on<br />how often I listen to the L.A. Woman woman, this is my favorite. The screaming in the title<br />tune is awesome. It's all awesome. The last song, \\"Riders On The Storm\\" is apocalyptic in<br />some ways, and mournful. Like Morrison is going out into the waves not to return. As<br />it turns out, the rest of the band see Jim leaving America altogether. Personally, I don't<br />think his \\"coming out\\" had anything to do with Jim Morrison's final farewell at all.<br />The Doors were not really welcome here in the U.S. at all. I guess Miami was why. Or it<br />was because he was more talented than a dozen other singers at that time.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Get it. Cuz I said so. Get it get it get it woooot . I have to keep writing to meet the minimum word requirement.
0812550706|5.0|I love almost all of Orson Scott Card's books. The Ender's series has won well deserved numerous awards. This is a \\"Must Read\\"!<br />I think it would be amazing if schools started having students read different genre's in class. English classes should help develop a love for reading, especially if students are not seeing family members \\"reading pleasure books\\" at home. A book like Ender's Game might help some students develop a love for reading. Lastly, for those English teachers out there: I have seen teaching unit guides for this specific book because it does have many educational properties.

Very beautiful images and it comes with a book with a meaning for the cards.<br /><br />If you are in your Angelic spiritual development, you know will know in due time who is your Archangel or which oracles to buy. Mine just happens to be AA Michael and when I do a reading is always right on.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|fun and will recommend it. easy to play.  fun to play. wish you create your own design. that would be more fun.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Absolutely riveting and a must see! People need to know what unwavering efforts were put into the locating of Bin Ladin. It may be hard for some to watch, put it should be watched and the facts learned by everyone. At no point does it advocate torture, the facts of what happened are the facts.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|No woman should ever be so powerless when it comes to a man. They really shouldn't have that kind of grip on you.
B000FC10MU|4.0|My major concern when I purchased this book was that there was going to be some sort of religious or political motive - i.e. a 'one true God' or 'we are materialistic' kind of book. It isn't. The fact that it doesn't have a motive like those I mentioned thrilled me. The only thing that really bothered me about the book was the obvious grammatical errors that showed up every once in a while (in the Kindle version, I can't speak for the print version). God was never capitalized, and there were some missing articles of speech (I'm not professing to be a grammar pro, but the errors really hindered the flow sometimes).<br /><br />The book itself has a great concept, and is unlike anything I have read. It's a truly excellent idea.
1452101248|4.0|and if you do too, that section alone merits the purchase of this book. His recipes are more jumping off points of inspiration rather than to be strictly followed.<br /><br />Very few food writers convey a love of food as well as he does.<br /><br />(docked a star for being less good than his first book, but get them all).
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Bought this for my son for his trip to Europe about a month ago and it worked great for him.  The dual port allowed him to charge friends' phones at the same time as charging his own.  The charges were quick and never a problem.  Very pleased with price, shipping and quality.

B009AMANBA|4.0|I found this movie interesting, but very long and drawn out. Not a movie in my opinion to watch again another time, but certainly to see once and get an idea of what it was like for a President in that day!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Like many above have said I thought Lincoln was a great movie I am not much for History style movies but I enjoyed it. My only criticsm about this release is how The dvd non Blu Ray gets only 2 special features while Blu Ray gets 5.<br /><br />One of the reasons I wanted to get Lincoln was for the special features and I expected their to be more than 2 on the dvd release. Movie studios please stop screwing non Blu Ray owners out of Special Features.<br /><br />Other than the lack of Special Features I highly recommend this movie.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Alternately inspiring and horrifying, a wonderful yarn of an exceptional life. This story has as much to say about Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism as shipwrecks and tigers. One of the most insightful and exciting stories that I have ever read.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This so challenging but yeat somewhat easy. You have to use your mind to lay out a pattern to solve the level. If you dont get a star on it you should keep trying till you do. A star means you have mastered that level. I have the free level right now. It is relaxing and I love doing it.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I don't know why I thought this was going to be any different than the Lord of the Rings. Entertaining story and graphics but same old drawn out mundane details and scenes of people running across vast landscapes. I knew better than to watch this before the entire series was complete and available to watch all at one time...at least the ending didn't leave you right in the middle of an unresolved story line like some of the previous movies
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great little calculator and even better because it's FREE!  We use it very often as it comes in hand and is easy to use!

B005GIS23I|5.0|Paul was lots of fun though the language eventually seemed excessive and possibly was used to gain the higher rating... other than bad language it's appropriate for younger crowds
B003O86FMW|5.0|The HUNGER GAMES was a refreshing, clean adventure/romance which whetted my appetite for more.  CATCHING FIRE did not disappoint.  Even though this series was written for teen age girls, this 84 year old man thoroughly enjoyed all tree in the series.  It was difficult to stop reading to eat meals.  Suzanne Collins did a masterful job of keeping the adrenalin up.
B0065GC0PG|5.0|As the other reviewers said, well written fairy tale with twists. I couldn't put it down after halfway through. I hope to hear more of Cinder & Kai.

B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Great product, just like most of the Playfirst series. Wish they were longer. This game is a fun time Management game that doesn't take a rocket scientist to have some fun with.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Spoiler alert! well not really,<br />For those that did not read the book or catch this in theaters this is part 1 of 2<br />There are nearly 2 hours of special features that is what makes this film nearly 4 hours long.<br />Be advised You are buying a bit over 2 hours of movie...<br />I found the length misleading
B006OOHYIC|5.0|challenging enough to keep it interesting. I love spatial puzzle type games so it is a nice new option for anyone who likes those
B001NLKWLW|3.0|While this book was well written, it seemed to lack excitement and the characters weren't my favorite.<br />A good read for those who like a more laid back story line.

B00BB8RKH6|2.0|This heavy handed treatment of alcoholism quickly shows the viewer that he or she will be treated to a man reaching rock bottom.  Staying true to this early foreshadowing, it continues down a path which can be predicted at each turn, concluding so sappily that I found myself groaning.  The movie is technically very well made and the use of music is superior, pushing it up to a two star rating.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I downloaded this after seeing &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; at the theater.  I couldn't put the book down!  I would recommend it to anyone who loves suspense/mystery without a supernatural twist.  I would definitely read Lee Child again.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|It was beautiful, heartbreaking, amazing.. I can't find the right words to describe how I'm feeling right now. It was definitely way different from my normal reads and I loved it so much that I cried my little eyeballs out for a good 10-15 mins! There's just so much you can take from this here. This is a MUST read. Worth every last penny and every minute spent reading it!
0786838655|5.0|I think this whole series is amazing and I think that anybody who loves to read about action and adventure should read this series.

0307352153|4.0|In “Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking,” Susan Cain has captured the American attitude about introversion well- in a fast paced and personality driven culture, it is easy to overlook those who are more reflective than loquacious. Considering how quickly our culture has changed in the past one hundred years, there seems to be little time for deep thinking since everyone risks not keeping up with the rate of change in business, entertainment, and means of communication. We have become so comfortable with this idea that Cain suggests “We tend to think that becoming more extroverted not only makes us more successful, but also makes us better people.” Is this really the case in the United States today? Is such an attitude an exaggerated claim about the benefits of extroversion?<br /><br />Cain takes her readers on a cross country journey (and even overseas) to study this compelling observation. She places a significant emphasis on the transformation of American culture from a culture of character to a culture of personality in the past one hundred years, stating that this change has happened primarily because we have become less agrarian and more culturally centered around areas of dense populations. She studies and interviews thought leaders in academia, Evangelicalism, and business to find out their candid attitudes about spoken and unspoken personality expectations. Her findings and conclusions should surprise any reader- regardless of what you have thought about personality differences in the past, Cain will challenge your thinking.<br /><br />People who are introverts will find Cain’s analysis penetrating, insightful, and perhaps redemptive. She demonstrates how unspoken rules about personality expectations affect a career, relationships, and expectations of others. The strengths of an introverted personality can be important assets. However, strengths are precarious assets when wielded effectively since they also expose weaknesses.<br /><br />Her chapter entitled “When Should You Act More Extroverted Than You Really Are?” provides crucial application for managing a common weaknesses associated with introverts. The strengths of an internal fortitude are best revealed when they are publicly displayed- however, this is an exhausting exercise for introverts; knowing how to pace and recharge the energy needed for sustained social interaction is critical in order to communicate with and influence other people. Cain teaches the reader that public presentation of extroverted characteristics at key moments can be as rewarding as it is exhausting.<br /><br />Those who are extroverted will find Cain’s analysis beneficial for understanding and relating to people with different personality types. Families, churches, businesses, and organizations are full of individuals spanning the spectrum of personality types; while it is easier for us to relate to those with a personality similar to our own, we will all be more effective when we can identify and make full use of all the strengths of each of our team members.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. If you are an introvert, be prepared for Cain’s words to cut a little too close to the heart- but continue to read to the end! Your greatest strength is also your greatest weakness; once you can learn to temper the rugged edges of your gift, you will learn to be even more effective in your career and relationships. Under the right light, a person’s strengths are more evident; knowing which light to shine under can be a tricky task for introverts, especially “…in a world that can’t stop talking.”<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think this one is my favorite. It's such a lovely love story. It's only my 3rd time reading it.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Words really cannot describe how much I liked this book. It will make you sad, angry, and even happy at times. Most of all it keeps you engaged. Having finished the book, I feel privileged to have  read the stories of Laila and Mariam's lives. This is a must read.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Read this before watching the new movie and was glad I did since the movie would have been way confusing without the background.  However, all of these paid-by-the-word authors just got way to carried away.  Pages and pages describing every shot fired in the Battle of Waterloo just to set the stage for the thief being there.  Hours of diatribe by the revolutionaries.  Way to much.  Definitely would have been better as a Reader's Digest Condensed version!  But I was very grateful to have this free text-to-speech version!!!  I never would have sat down to read the whole book.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book was just okay. I don't really understand the hype. I understand it is fiction, but a 20 something gazillionaire? I haven't recommended to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game! My 6 yr. Old LOVES this game. Easy to understand, and great if you are a horse lover. Highly recommend!
B002Y5FKUE|1.0|They just re-wrote Bellini. They moved the action to the modern day and set it in a warehouse loft. They had the lead soprano camp it up and play it like a farce. They had dancers do a silly clog routine during the finale. On opening night the audience booed it because the production was SO INCREDIBLY RIDICULOUS AND SO INCREDIBLY BAD! The critics hated it, but the pseudo intellectuals adored it. Welcome to the world of RegieTrash opera.
0307592731|1.0|Incredible story of how deep a person's emotional pain can be and how we need to find our own path to embrace and reconcile it.  Excellent story of perseverance, simplicity, and problem solving.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun with really good graphics. Lots of missions and different ways to play hidden object games. Would like it more if it picked up where I was in the game on Facebook.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Jumps right in where the first book left off. Easy read with a good story line.  You'll definitely want to continue on and read the 3rd book as well!

B00BHMETKC|4.0|As the parent of two children, I rarely get a chance to watch films made for adults so I was glad to find a few hours to watch this on DVD.  This based-on-a-true-story film provides fascinating insight into the real-life events that occurred when six American employees of the embassy in Iran were forced to hide out after the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1980.<br /><br />I'm old enough to remember the crisis itself when 52 employees of the American embassy in Iran were taken hostage.  What I had not heard about was the six Americans who escaped and were provided with refuge by the Canadian ambassador.  This is the story of how the CIA helped them escape from Iran by passing them off as a Hollywood film crew.<br /><br />Truly, this is a story worthy of the big screen.  I strongly suspect that quite a bit of dramatic license was added to create more tension and suspense throughout the film.  In fact, a quick internet search confirms those suspicions.  Still, this is a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours . . . and learn a little history at the same time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing and addictive. Although I think the game should add a feature like easy medium or hard so you don't have to start off slow in the beginning which kind of gets annoying. Otherwise this game is very fun. Also I think maybe the game could have a sign in for different account s so if the game gets erased or something goes wrong you just sign in to the account. Thanks! ~nomadicsugar
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a great book and anyone who likes true stories should read this book. I really learned from this book about a lot of things that I did not know about hospitals research and people.JUST read it, very eye opening book.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|A great alternative rock band, have great potential. Not many music groups start off so well. But this is a definite recommended buy.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Charges in half the time works great, makes it easy to down load off my computer unto the Kendel Fire. Able to use on charger in car with USB port.
B008JFUN8C|4.0|I might not have gone to this movie on my own, but I willingly accompanied by daughters.  And I was glad I did.<br /><br />Oz: The Great and Powerful is the prequel to the classic Wizard of Oz, one of my nostalgic favorites.  If you've ever wondered how the \\"man behind the curtain\\" became the great and powerful Oz (as I often have), this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Oscar Diggs is a small-time magician from Kansas with big aspirations and limited potential.  When he pisses off the wrong people (e.g. the strong man of the traveling carnival show), he attempts escape and flees in his hot air balloon.  But . . . his balloon gets caught in a tornado and he ends up in the magical, technicolor land of Oz.  Sound familiar?<br /><br />Because of his unusual arrival to Oz, he is immediately mistaken for a powerful wizard whose arrival has been prophesied . . . and breathlessly awaited.  It has been foretold that the wizard will help defeat the wicked witch and restore the residents of Oz to their former freedoms.<br /><br />The only problems is that Oscar Diggs is a mere mortal, not a powerful wizard, and doesn't feel much motivated to risk his own life to help this foreign land.  But with a little help from a good witch and a faithful flying monkey, Oscar performs wonders . . . and becomes the man he was predicted to be.<br /><br />As I watched, I found myself thinking how bizarre this movie was . . . flying monkeys, moving trees, strange inhabitants of the land.  I really enjoyed the parts that harkened back to the original Wizard of Oz . . . and then I remembered, the original had bizzare features as well.  Indeed, that is one of the appeals of the Oz films . . . both of them.  I especially liked how this film explained elements of the original.<br /><br />It you grew up with the Wizard of Oz (remember when they played it once a year on television around Easter time?), you will enjoy this nostalgic trip back to a familiar and fascinating (if also bizarre) land.
B000065V3H|4.0|Patrick Dempsey is even more McDreamy as a geek than a doctor. The end gives me chills every time I watch it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game. It is funny and addicting.<br />You should play it because it is good. Everyone will love this game. I really do not understand why I must have twenty words...this is ridiculous.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it its a lot of fun :) awesome that's all I can say. :) kool kool. koool!!!!! This game is really entertaining. my friend likes it also :)
B003XDVVO0|5.0|I love my new Crocs! they are just as comfortable as my old ones ( I have 3 other pairs!) but more stylish.. i have had lots off positive comments on them.
B00BWI3RTA|5.0|I don't understand all the criticism of the new album. It's fantastic. If you're a fan of Dido, if you've enjoyed her other albums, you'll love this one.
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|For anyone like me who saw this tour in 1988, it's nice to finally be able to revisit Maiden at the height of their fame and musicianship.<br /><br />The video quality is obviously improved over the original VHS release. And the 5.1 audio is well balanced, only lacking in the bass response.
B007CMD5EC|5.0|John5 is an amazing guitar player. This disc is a mix of hard rock and great acoustic work. This guy is the next Hendrix!!
B005BOHYW2|5.0|Loved this story, charactors were very good.The sort of book you could read over and over.<br />Hope we get another good read soon
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Great movie, perfect cast it will definitely make you cry. I watch it when I need to have that heart warming feeling. Also Emma Stone is hiliarious.
B000V8A95C|5.0|What a great show! And what great music! This one is played daily in my house.  The cast did a stellar job bringing the emotions felt while in the theater home.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|I heard an interview with Caitilin Moran and was excited to read her book.  I think she is witty and had some interesting points to make, but no real comprehensive analysis about feminism.  I believe she minimizes female contribution to society and is overly concerned with Brazilian waxes and the lack of female lead guitar players.  I did not feel particularly inspired by this book, which I got the impression from the interview was the point of the book. She wanted promote feminism in its true meaning and peel away the stereotypes that have pushed women away from that word.  I am glad she is starting the conversation, I just wish she had more to say.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I enjoyed the reading. I could figure out a few things early on in the book, but the way it unfolds is still satisfying. I liked the characters, the destructive nature of the main character, and the mystery unravels pretty well.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I tried to play this game but it said try again but it never worked. I hats it. don't. get it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book explained the background of the characters. The possible reasons they act like they do. The best of all 3 books.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I loved this book.  It was a great mystery and I totally believed it all at face value.  Needless to say, I was very surprised at the end.  I real a lot of books.  This one stands out as great.
B0027MJU00|3.0|It read almost like an episode of the CBS show Cold Case. I was waiting for the blond and the latin guy to show up with some nice kitschy music from the 80s. It wasn't as good as her first novel. The characters were somewhat interesting, but in the end I was a little disappointed in it overall. I felt it was too linear and unfolded in too predictable of a pattern. The end was a bit too convenient to me. It's a very fast read. Something for a long plane ride, but nothing much more than that.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Awesome game really enjoy how you can change the speed of the car. I also enjoy how you can decide how you want to steer.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like it. Its not too time consuming and it gives me a little break during my busy day. Cute!!
B004SRWW0C|1.0|I read the info and its said it worked with my android Samsung phone.<br />however it doesn't!<br />tech support says call my cell phone provider, they say call amazon...yadda yadda.<br /><br />do not recommend!
B00985E3UG|5.0|Riveting. Written very well, very readable, very accessible. Makes you rethink everything you think you know about food. Does bread really have to have 27 ingredients? Did you notice that ice cream is sometimes called &#34;frozen dairy dessert&#34; because it is no longer ice cream? Who remembers those Breyer's commercials from the 80s where the guy would read the ingredients of a Breyer's container and another competitor? Well, guess what? Breyer's is just as bad as the rest of them now. There are just too many ingredients in the food we eat.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Personally, the only thing I don't like is that you can't earn gems in game. Like every time you gain a level you get one free gem would be nice.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|A great buy  for the real Hendrix listener- who really likes Jimi's music .<br /><br />This \\"new\\" album,may seem weird,to the  loaves and fishes circus fan - that  gets off on only  his signature cuts-live Monterrey,Purple Haze,Foxey Lady,live Fillmore East '69-70,etc.<br /><br />Jimi's sister,Janie Hendrix,who is over of all Jimi's authentic tracks,has selected  these unreleased tracks - and  tracks that  Jimi made either in the studio and in concerts - so  they are all authentic.Some  these tracks,are from  some post humorous albums with Jimi's name on it.The last  album Jimi had  real living orchestration  over,was CRY OF LOVE (1970) a month before  he was murdered(Sept/1970)  by his racist manager Micheal Jeffrey and his goons.They faked a suicide.His death was quite covered up.<br /><br />Personally as a real fan, I enjoy knowing about the person,his roots,and how he became  a  icon.I'm not  interested in  the hater  hearsay negatives.I don't need to get high to listen to his music - and I  don't care  for all his songs and antics onstage. Jimi actually didn't enjoy all the  circus moves onstage  -but  it  was what the  loaves  and fishes fans  paid to see, and  he  didn't want to disappoint them.<br />He also received  boos and death threats from racist audiences - harsh  criticism from  black people, who thought his act was a bunch of noise and clownish.He  was  also pressured to play music  for activists' race hate groups like the Black Panther party.The CRY of LOVE \\"Freedom\\" track, was as far as he would go  with that.<br /><br />I created a honest Facebook page about him and his  music(FANS OF JIMI HENDRIX)that doesn't get many likes - but I like it and thats what matters to me.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This game is alot like Bejeweled, you're still trying to get three of a color together, but it includes extra challenges. The levels aren't long and it saves your progress, so it's a good game to play when you just need to waste a few minutes.
B0061S073A|5.0|I use this app with our 4- and 7-year-olds.  It's easy to operate, and I've come to trust it to allow them to have fun but protect them from harmful content.

B00BLGZDYA|5.0|This is a must see film for any serious artist, filmmaker, and cinephile. It's not mainstream, it's not easy, it's beautiful and complex and filled with metaphors that beg repeat viewings. I saw this film twice in the cinema in NYC, and it's a breath of fresh air. A film that at once is both entertaining and enormously enigmatic, it is without a doubt the best film released in the US in 2012.
B009HNDTPO|5.0|I started watching this episode on DTV but a storm came and it didn't finish recording.  I was so pleased to find it on Amazon.  It was an awesome episode
B00BESNKB8|3.0|This movie had plenty of blood and gore, violence and kung fu fighting. There's humor too though, so it doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good cause this movie is over the top.
0345522478|4.0|I must say that I mostly agree with the negatve reviews. The humor is sometimes immature. The conflict is settled a little too tidy like. The protagonist isn' t as gritty or vunerable as Dresden. These reviewers just forgot to include how much fun of a read it is. I am through book five now and have enjoyed the heck out of this series
B004SOR4H6|2.0|I downloaded it but it didn't work very well for me but I don't know how to use it cuz I'm only 11 but I bet if I was like...... a teen then I would love it but now its not my favorite.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I like a game with a back story, one that tells you WHY you're running and trying to get these fish. Yet few games I actually play and like have this. This game is really fun and I recommend it for any age, young or old!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is great! I swim around eating people and giggling, but watch out for the jellyfish and lionfish! I have this game on my phone and my Kindle Fire HD, even though they're not synced, I'm having a great time growing my sharks!
B00AFEY354|5.0|First of all, the book is amazing.  When I heard that it was being made into a movie, I was skeptical.  However, this is by far the BEST adaptation from a book to a movie I have yet to see.  It pretty much stuck to the book the entire movie.  For some reason, I just found myself smiling during the whole movie.  I was SO happy that is was in tune with the book I absolutely love.  The actors that were chosen couldn't have been any better - they portrayed the characters in the book perfectly.  THIS is how movie adaptions should be done.  If you loved the book, you will love the movie.
B0052T7I18|2.0|The vinyl arrives without external plastic cover. The insert was broken in three sides and the vinyl presents a light mark in the first three tracks of side A.
B008J9EYFG|5.0|it took time to grow on me but now one of the CD's that I never tire of.  She has a special voice and her music lovely.
B00BI745AA|5.0|Of course, with this cast how could it lose? Hugh Jackman is fantastic, the entire cast puts their heart and soul into this version of the classic. Really excellent.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Of course the action with the Seals is awesome. The movie in addition does a great job of showing the tribulations while heroically depicting the good people involved.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is good for a kid to get a lot of strategy and that is what you get from this game.It is neat how we learn different cultures from traveling from country to country.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!!  It's just like taking care if your own horse!! I mean is there any other horse game that has minigames to take care of your horse and make your rider unique and train it and compete in competitions around the world?  I don't think so, so you should defintly get this especially if u love horses (hope u follow my advice if u like horses and hopefully you'll follow the advice).
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Very good game, but some boards are nearly impossible to pass! Maybe I'm missing something, but I struggled to get by a few of them. It's a match 3 game that rewards you with items you need on your journey.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I always love Ken Follett's work.  When I read one of his books or a series of books I feel like I get a mini history lesson mixed with drama, mystery and adventure.  I love the way he builds his characters and intertwines their stories.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hours of entertainment.  If you have two devices, kids can play together.  Good entertainment.  Truly enjoyed playing along or together.
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|As I listen to this cd, being a Bowie fan of many years, I could not believe Bowie would release this drab cd after 10 years.<br /><br />There is no 'I want to sing along' aspect of these songs at all. Same instruments on all songs and no big hit worthy of Radio airplay.<br />Yet there are so many great reviews of this album that I guess I am the minority here. This puzzles me but we are all entitled to our opinion.<br /><br />After purchasing this CD, I did get a little of my money's worth out of it as I now use it as a coaster for my nightly tea and cake binge. This cd isn't worth more than that.
B00BWHAP1E|2.0|Although I've been a big fan of the \\"Die Hard\\" series over the past 25 years (all owned on Blu ray), I was a bit reluctant to see this one. Based primarily on the trailers and some critical reviews I was going to wait for the movie to hit HBO in a few months.<br /><br />While on a road trip with my 17 year old son, he convinced me to go, himself a fan of the franchise. Even at only $4 a pop, it was time better served. John McClane (Bruce Willis, not looking his age) heads to Moscow to find out why his estranged son (Jai Courtney) has been imprisoned. It turns out son Jack did it on purpose to get close to a political prisoner who he hopes to rescue. Oh yeah, Jack's with the CIA.<br /><br />Nothing in the film makes sense in reality and the script is horrible. But at any time you can expect car chases, car crashes and plenty of flying bullets, rockets and fists. I suspect this is one of those films that was storyboarded with action sequences long before someone said, \\"well what's the movie about?\\" They never did figure that one out. My son was more generous and gave the movie 2 stars.<br /><br />The Blu ray version of the film will have a 1080p resolution and 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Audio will include a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 option.  The original package includes a DVD and digital copy as well.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Excellent read in itself in addition to setting up Winter of the World.  If you enjoy historical fiction this is a great read.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Big hit with my niece and nephew.  Love playing the game.  Hours of entertainment and enjoyment.  What big hit.  Would recommend for young kids.
B00A77II0U|5.0|loved it. I am new to this type of entertainment and wanted a game for my kindle. Easy to load; great graphics and story line. Cant wait for the next chapter.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|If you read the other books this one is an awesome third book. I can't wait for the next one!  By far the best book in the series so far.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I watched the musical many years ago from the Broadway theatre. I loved it because it had strong message of salvation. But I found the  movie version was  more entertaining because of the flexible angle of the camera lens allowing the scenes alive as well as the performance of the actors.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Although I had read this before, it was one of my first Reacher novels.  I wanted to re-read it now that I was more familiar with the character. Loved it more the second time.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I have read many Vonnegut novels, considering him to be the moralist we need in this day and age.  This is the second time I have read this book, and with this read, I am still only scratching the surface of the intricacies Vonnegut has left with us.  It challenges societal beliefs in the inevitability of war, and makes the reader question what is truly right and wrong with a war that claimed to truly be good vs. evil.  Read this book now.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I loved this book. I loved most about it was the research and detail the author put into knowing the Google headquarters. I think this author has some friends in high places, or a knack for detail and imagination.
B005HSL626|5.0|If there's anything more entertaining while in a busy airport with nothing to do than this, I don't want to know about it. This is one of my favorite app games ever.

B007FEZQF8|5.0|Totally like the show but a bit more action. This comic was finished in one day totally worth the e eight bucks.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Its an easy game, it can be addicting, my only negative thing to say about it is that I don't like it when you are guessing someones drawing and all they do is write what the answer is, there is no drawing at all, whats up with that.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is an amazing movie a total classic my daughters really love it and have watched it time and time again.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Jaycee Dugard was very brave to tell her story of being kidnapped by a sick individual. I am glad she survived her ordeal.
B002W19I8U|1.0|To the German version fans: this is not a review of that soundtrack!! There is a German version and American one, this is supposed to be the American one, it's not. First two very important songs are not even on here: The theme we hear whenever seeing the Ivory Tower is nowhere to be found, next the song played when Artax dies (how powerful and moving was that) is also missing, and then the \\"Swamps of Sadness\\" song which played as Atreyu was giving up and Falcor rescues him is altered and given some guitar riff, \\"Sleepy Dragon\\" is also altered.<br /><br />It's almost as if the record companies said \\"Hey, this was great in the film, but it just won't fit when people are listening to it at home\\". I understand some just don't prefer the whole 80's style techno theme altogether, but to those of us who do like that style in films like \\"Legend\\" and \\"Labyrinth\\" it is amazing and I am very upset that I can't find the true soundtrack to this film in either the American or German version. I wish Amazon reviewers would review the actual product rather than their childhood memories of the film, it would have saved me $10.
0385738765|5.0|From jaw-clenching suspense and bone-chilling horror to incredibly raw betrayal, James Dashner does it all. Truly -- \\"The Scorch Trails\\" is worth the read.<br /><br />When I first started \\"The Maze Runner,\\" I was a bit skeptical about the story's development; I found the nagging questions Thomas continued to ask (that went unanswered for a short while) to be somewhat annoying. However, I'll save that for my review of the first book on the series. \\"The Scorch Trails\\" was a completely different ball game, and it's safe to say that the series redeemed itself in my eyes 100% after reading this novel.<br /><br />At first, it was hard to picture Thomas as being a mature, capable young-adult. I find that this happens often to me (and many other avid readers) who are older than the main characters in the story. Now that I am older, I feel as though I look down upon those younger than myself, especially narrators. During \\"The Maze Runner\\" I definitely saw the Gladers this way -- as confused, scared children.<br /><br />\\"The Scorch Trails\\" offered a different perspective to me. {Caution, slight spoilers ahead}... Once the remaining Gladers flee the maze and the dorm they are brought to at the beginning of this novel, I began to see Thomas, along with the other Gladers, as more mature, confident, able adults. They are supposed to be \\"geniuses,\\" after all, cut out to be the best of the best, Leaders. Candidates.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the story. The plot in this book was much more exciting than in Book 1. Book 1 was solely inside the Maze until the very end. This novel, however, takes place in the Scorch, and the Gladers travel quite a distance throughout the duration of this story. Many new characters are introduced, and sadly many die off.<br /><br />Characters -- another aspect to be praised about Dashner's writing. I found all of the main, staple characters to be likeable and real. Dashner isn't afraid to allow his more \\"manly\\" characters to express emotions such as terror, fear, sorrow -- his characters even often cry. This makes them seem more realistic to me, and I like that. It's something I look for in books; real, tangible characters who I can't seem to get out of my mind.<br /><br />OK, let's talk about the plausibility of it all. Dashner, as many of you who have read Book 1 have seen, creates totally wild, frightening, and whimsical settings. While some of the things that appear in \\"The Scorch Trails\\" are very real, many are not. This is not necessarily a bad thing, though. I find that my imagination connects the dots when there are implausible scenarios offered through writing. For example {spoiler alert}, the invisible walls that barricade the \\"Rat Man\\" in the beginning scene. What? Random invisible walls? And, what's a Flat Trans? How can you just transport from one place to the next? These are two very common examples of implausibilities in \\"The Scorch Trails\\" and many other books for that matter. But who cares? Invisible walls and teleportation and telepathy may seem impossible, but in the world of literature anything is possible.<br /><br />Now for a few things I did not like {slight spoilers again, not bad though}; the sleeping scenes. Thomas falls in and out of sleep quite frequently, and sometimes I find the \\"wake-up-for-five-minutes-and-then-sleep-again\\" instances a bit too repetitive and useless. Not always, but come on, just sleep. I admit that it shows restlessness, but eh...I still can't make myself enjoy that constant wake-up and sleep-again over and over scenario.<br /><br />Secondly, many disagree with Dashner's occasionally obvious and cliche ways to create suspense. I find instances such as these quite bearable, though. Personally, I love cliffhangers and suspense, even ones as obvious as warning like \\"Bad things are about to happen.\\" Yet, as I have said, I love mystery books as well.<br /><br />That being said, this genre is also one of my favorites. Dystopian YA novels are incredible common and popularright now, and I've read many, like \\"Matched\\" by Allie Condie and \\"Divergent\\" by Veronica Roth. Different stories, yes, but similar. \\"The Scorch Trails\\" was simply amazing -- loved all the action and suspense and somewhat of a love-triangle. Sorta.<br /><br />Book 2 beat Book 1 by a MILE. I just recently started Book 3, so I hope the bar stays set and only raises for this series. I have my hopes. So far I've thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely worth the read!!!!right now, and I've read many, like \\"Matched\\" by Allie Condie and \\"Divergent\\" by Veronica Roth.

0374533571|5.0|Saw the movie then read the book. The book played out each characters beautifully. Anyone could have imagined themselves in the shoes of Pat or Tiffany finding the silver lining in each other.
B008476HBM|5.0|Excellent book. A very good read. Ending is what you did not expect. Very difficult english. One of the best books out there.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|By all means, if you love the Lord of the Rings movies, see this movie.  That said, however, I must add that I was somewhat disappointed by it.  It was great to see Gandalf again, and Golem and Saruman and Elrond, and Martin Freeman, as Bilbo, is a born hobbit; but a good deal of material not in the book has been added, making the movie feel over-padded and overcooked, all to make three movies out of it instead of the one, or at most two, that it should have been.  The book is a charming prequel to the Lord of the Rings, not a rival to it, and so should have been the movie.  Note to Peter Jackson:  Five minutes of Gandalf and his party being chased through underground chasms by the bad guys being good in Lord of the Rings doesn't make fifteen minutes of it with over the top sets and special effects better in The Hobbit.  So much of this movie feels padded and/or over the top, and that's the problem with it.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Before watching this movie I had watched the TV productions of the concert version of Les Miz many times. I know most of the lyrics by heart after listening to the London Cast CD hundreds of times. I thought I was prepared for what was to come. I had no idea.<br /><br />I turned off the lights, started the instant video, and my husband and I began watching. Within a minute we had left our home and were in France watching one of the most compelling scenes we have ever witnessed. There was no going back.<br /><br />We watched and cried, recouped our forces, then cried some more. It was painful yet cathartic, in a strange way, and I was totally unprepared.<br /><br />I can't ever remember being swept into a movie before where I felt like I was actually there witnessing the events. I was cold and damp, in the rain, and warm and dry by the fire. I smelled the sweat, fear, sewer, and blood.<br /><br />It was totally awesome and I was watching it on a fairly small TV by today's standards. I can't even imagine what it is like to see it in a theater.<br /><br />After watching Les Miz, and the other Academy winners, I feel that this film was robbed by the academy. If they could have seen it through my Le Miz-vigin eyes, I think they would have given it far more awards. As it is, I think the movie was just a rehash, to them, of a stage play they had watched into the ground.<br /><br />As I said, I know the music by heart but I've never heard it sung with so much passion. I loved its imperfection and intimacy. It tore my heart into shreds and then put it all back together at the end.<br /><br />I want to thank everyone involved in the production for giving me the movie of a life-time. There is simply nothing more I could have asked of this film. It is simply the best movie I have ever had the privilege to watch.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Fun to play the game and it's fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun and very very very fun fun year and I am looking forward to the next one always complicated and the way of life fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B003O86FMW|5.0|On the edge of my seat!!!! Awesome book to continue the series! Can't wait to start the last book! Exciting
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great movie! It gives you insight on how the operation was done and how much risk was involved from the start all the way through the finish. We should be thankful for all of the people working overseas to make our country a stronger one.
B0052BZ6X8|3.0|...and this fit the bill. It had a formulaic plot, little character development, and lame villains, but is entertainment nonetheless.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Bosch is a great character in the long tradition of good cops defeating evil. Well worth the read of the Black Box
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|This was a movie down very well!  Love Ben Affleck's work.  Very detailed and emotional all around!!!<br />Highly recommend... Definitely picture of the year.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This is a great tool for remote access, streaming videos from other PCs etc.. Works just great and easy to use.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Great app to use if you are a college student. I use it almost everyday. Finds the definitions very quickly
B00992CF6W|5.0|i really like this game, and i like it. but i wished it was more cheaper or there was a lite version for this, cause for i phone and i pad and i pod, they have a free lite version to play this.... anyway, i really like this game, and totally love it!
B000JML7EC|4.0|I have so many of these books in solid books on my shelves, collecting dust. This, however, will not collect dust. It will be in my luggage and in my work bag. Thank you.
B00BN2NQFU|5.0|Maintain the high standards of a Cirque production.<br />Phenominal performances and beautiful story and<br />production..  Loved the music combining all the<br />LasVegas shows in one story.
030771652X|3.0|I so enjoyed this book as I thought the writing was excellent and I enjoyed the science aspect of the story as well. I was just completely disappointed by the ending. After investing all that time in an emotional storyline I wanted more closure, to hear more about what happens after that last night....With Bee, With Kasia, with the killer.......There was not enough closure and I was crushed.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I really enjoy this game!! It's totally addictive. I can't stop playing it. Graphics are great and easy to navigate
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I can not say enough about the great books I have obtained through you for my e-reader. Excited to read.
B009ZOCLD6|1.0|For my purchase, I was torn between this and the one of Sarah Chang (Brahms + Bruch). Concerning musicality, Lisa Batiashvilli prevail without doubt , but the poor quality of the sound has tipped the balance in favor of Chang. Yes, a C.D. is two things, there is the expression and the recording technique, and when this technique is that bad, the frustration is there, we are in the 21st century after all! ...
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Funny. Inspirational. Emotional.<br /><br />I love this movie dearly. Definitely a classic.<br />Like Malcolm X, JFK, and Thomas Jeff., every American should watch this.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|One of the best TV shows we ever watched! The service was super fast, the item perfectly clean. We enjoy it very much. Thanks you I'll look forward to buy more from you guys!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This isn't the type of game I usually play but something about the pictures drew me in. At first I tried to navigate using the touch method on my kindle but I couldn't get the car to respond the way i wanted it to so I changed over to tilting and it worked out well. The graphics are great and I love crashing into things - it's hilarious! The more coins you collect the more changes you can make to your vehicle and driver. I would recommend this game.
B00913DPW2|3.0|I did not enjoy this game very much. The game movement was ok, graphics ok, but it is hard to figure out what to do next. I have not finished the game yet and not sure I will. No hidden objects, which is ok just letting others know. So far the game has been finding objects and figuring out what to do with them. I've actually finished one objective but it took forever. I am just not having fun. I will leave it on my kindle for awhile, but I have already loaded another game. I just felt I had to rate this game for others like myself. If you don't like to cheat and find walkthroughs, you may not like this game because it is really difficult. I had no problems loading, but occasionally had to back out of the game and go back in just to be able to move, it just seemed &#34;stuck&#34;. Good Luck!
B004EWFUQY|5.0|No matter what I eat, healthy or not, I either gain or do not budge. On the first week, I lost 9 pounds. On the second, 3. On the third, 5. This works, I SWEAR. I really really recommend this. This is safe for teenagers no younger than 14/15.
B000BH4YJ0|5.0|The service was incredible fast, the item very well packed &  was brand new! I just love it the songs of my childhood in the voice of one of the most incredible singers of my country.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I have been recommending this to my friends and they have been equally as enthusiastic as I have. Hawkes was should have received more recognition for his performance. The rest of the cast was equally as moving. Great story, great film.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was one of the best I've played. Loaded fine, graphics good, play was smooth. Difficulty was medium to medium hard. Did not need to use help button but once. Recommend this one!
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|If this is Soderbergh's last film he has certainly not disappointed.Both in his film technique, his canvas of acting talent,his straddling of genres and in his subject matter,he displays a mesmerizing thriller set in the ominous,mysterious world of Big Pharma where drugs feed the right to happiness(many with scary side effects),with a screenplay by Scot Burns,who refers to films like Fatal Attraction and Jagged Edge.Soderbergh uses panache,dexterity and pacing in a world of psycho-sexual ambiguity.Rooney Mara's troubled patient Emily Is at the centre of a web of pharmaceutical/psychiatric machinations,she takes her Psychiatrist Dr Jonathan Banks'(Jude Law) prescribed anti-depressants after a deliberate head-on smash following her husband's release from prison.Dr Banks serves as a \\"consultant\\" to a large pharmaceutical company and he is experimenting with the new Ablixa medication. Mara plays her part with inscrutable,dark mysteriousness.There are no foundations to the effects of the drug or the character of Emily.Emily sleep walks and still appears suicidal. Mara is phenomenal.Jonathan seeks counsel from Victoria Siebert(Zeta-Jones),Emily's former therapist,who seems to know more than she is willing to reveal.<br /><br />The vulnerability upon which our expectations of Mara are built are soon switched by Soderbergh/Burns's genre-morphing. As with medication we don't know what the long-term effects of each character's moral ambiguity will be.In the next part of the film Dr Banks becomes the central part of the film. Thrown into scandal when his patient is involved in a tragic accident after taking Ablixa.He slowly unravels as his decisions come back to haunt him,and he has to cross several moral boundaries to get his life back on track in a wrong man procedural(aka Hitchcock).His frustrations expertly played by Jude Law.However everything is never what it seems. At times there is a slippery quality and slickness to the proceedings as there are fakers and bigger fakers,a world of double crosses and blackmail where we ourselves are manipulated. Then tricksy mechanics and narrative pirouettes in an impeccable craft makes the story's centre of gravity elusive,its not the story itself but the way it is presented that grabs us. Despite formal rigour,the human element and emotional empathy is squeezed out.This is a spectacular,intricate and thrilling journey with great performances,forward momentum and abundant surprises with frequent close-ups and the shift in and out of focus of a master.If he retires the landscape will be duller.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like it but when I click it it turns back and goes back to kindle home page otherwise it was awesome
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV. I don't like gore or horror type stuff, but was pleasantly surprised that this show is rich with interesting characters, plot lines and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B0000DD79B|5.0|This is a great CD that includes all of their best hits.  It's a great way to go back to the days when things didn't seem so stressful.
B009IHED0E|4.0|This is not going to be an easy review to write.  I've been a fan of Rob Reed, songwriter/producer of Kompendium's \\"Beneath the Waves\\", since I first heard \\"Metamorphosis\\", by Reed's Prog band Magenta.  This is a truly great album, and I have since managed to track down nearly all of Magenta's albums, live and studio (not an easy task in the USA, where I live).  I discovered a remarkably high-quality and consistent body of work, ranging all the way from Yes-Topographic-style epics (\\"Revolutions\\"), to outrageously catchy pop songs (\\"The Singles\\"), to angst-ridden, Evanescence-style metal (\\"Chameleon\\").<br /><br />There seems to be no limits to Reed's songwriting prowess, so naturally I was quite excited by \\"Beneath the Waves\\", a sprawling, hugely ambitious epic with two choirs, a 30 piece string orchestra, and more prog royalty than you could shake a stick at.  (It's a tribute to Reed's standing in the Prog community that so many great musicians consented to be a part of it.)  Yet, as occasionally happens with such projects, the whole is less, not more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />To be sure, there are many beautiful moments, and it is impeccably produced, as I have come to expect from Rob Reed. But the basic story from lyricist Steve Reed, about a grief-stricken man full of guilt after his wife's suicide, inspired a large amount of slow and mid-tempo ballads, without a whole lot of variation.  Those expecting a rock record are going to be disappointed - The tone is quite lyrical, subdued, and melancholy, with a lot of Scottish/Irish folk influence (Uilleann Piper Troy Donockley from Mostly Autumn supplying most of the folksy-ness).  And, very unusually for R. Reed, there are a couple of weak songs on \\"Beneath the Waves\\".  For the life of me, I cannot figure out why \\"Il Tempo É Giunto\\", sung in Italian with an operatic tenor, is on this album.  It sounds like a bad Puccini knockoff, and since no translation is provided, most listeners will likewise be scratching their heads.<br /><br />The other main problem, as I see it, is lead vocalist Steve Balsamo.  He certainly has a great \\"full\\" voice, and an even better falsetto (carrying him with ease all the way up to \\"G\\", at the top of the treble clef), but like so many pop/rock singers, has trouble negotiating between the two.  One can hear this graphically on the otherwise excellent title track, which lies right on the \\"break\\" between these two registers.  He also has a hyper-intense, emotional delivery that I find tiring as the album progresses.  In my opinion, his voice is more suited to a metal band like Dream Theater (indeed, they already have such a singer) than the more restrained, lyrical muse of Rob Reed.  I keep imagining how much better these songs would sound with Christina Booth (Magenta's superb lead singer), and it is no surprise that two of my favorite songs, (\\"Lilly and \\"Reunion\\"), feature excellent female vocalist Angharad Brinn.<br /><br />Still, even with my misgivings, this is an album well worth having.  Prog fans will be happy with longer tracks like \\"Exordium\\", 'Lost\\", \\"Beneath the Waves\\", \\"Reunion\\", and most especially \\"The Storm\\", a prog tour de force seamlessly combining full orchestra, chorus, celtic folk instruments, and a rock band into a satisfying whole.  These longer tracks make the best use of superb drummer Gavin Harrison (Porcupine Tree), who supplies whatever rock thrust there is on the album.  Excellent contributions are made also by Saxophonist Mel Collins (King Crimson), Guitarist Steve Hackett (Genesis), and bassist extraordinaire Nick Beggs (Steven Wilson, and seemingly, everyone else).  One also has to single out Neil Taylor also for his excellent guitar solo on \\"Beneath the Waves\\".<br /><br />Nor has Reed skimped on the packaging, which features an oversized sleeve and the beautiful, evocative paintings of Geoff Taylor.  All lyrics are included (large enough to actually read!) as well as bios of the many fine musicians involved.The Bonus DVD is a big disappointment - Companion DVDs to Magenta's albums (like \\"Metamorphosis\\", \\"Seven\\" and \\"Chameleon\\") have featured extended interviews with Rob Reed and lyricist Steve Reed that really enhanced the listening experience, plus Rob Reed at the mixing board, \\"deconstructing\\" the album and highlighting many details that would otherwise go unnoticed.  One finds nothing of the sort on the \\"Beneath the Waves\\" DVD, just the various 5.1 surround mixes, three rather ordinary music videos, and raw footage of the recording sessions.<br /><br />One would assume that the majority of those reading this review are Magenta fans wondering about Reed's new project - To them I would advise buying \\"Beneath the Waves\\", even with its flaws.  Reed is still a great musician, and the album contains a lot of beautiful music.  For those not familiar with Magenta, I would start there first.  There is their masterpiece, \\"Metamorphosis\\", but on a slightly less monumental scale is \\"Seven\\", one of the most likable and instantly memorable prog albums since Yes' \\"Fragile\\".  As a matter of fact, you pretty much can't go wrong with any Magenta album - They deserve to be much better known, especially in the USA.  Apparently there is a new Magenta album from the ever-prolific Reed due in 2013, and I for one can't wait.<br /><br />Scott Tisdel
B003L77GGK|5.0|This show instantly became my favorite on tv and I just had to have all the episodes! The characters are believable and it keeps you wanting more!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|When I tell you this is a damn good story that is still brewing...IT IS!!!!<br /><br />Eva and Gideon is my favorite novel couples and trust me, I have quite a few. Sylvia Day is an amazing writer with a great storyline. This book is filled with sex, lust, jealousy, hate, murder, and above all love!<br /><br />Bared to you was the intro to an unique love duo, Reflected in you is the body and I KNOW Entwined with you will be a beautiful ending. This is no Fifty Shades of Grey as most say, even though I liked that series as well. Sylvia Day Crossfire series is on another level. Can't wait till the finale of the third book.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|The ultimate Fleetwood Mac compilation, this edition includes almost every Fleetwood Mac song available.  From Tusk to Daddy, it's got it all.  Perfect gift for the Fleetwood Mac junkie.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Wreck-it Ralph is more suited for children who play video games often.  It is not a horrible movie, however I am glad we &#34;rented&#34; the movie via Amazon Prime and did not purchase the DVD.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|thanks. all is good. The product arrived on time and in good shape. Thanks for your quick response. have a good day.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I liked it. It was one of those books that you read knowing that these characters are going to drive you insane. But you keep reading because you just can't look away.<br /><br />I'm still trying to figure out how they ended up married. The book takes place over two semesters and these two spent more time fighting or broke up than they were together.<br /><br />Abby's roommate was right, they are a disaster.<br /><br />I liked America, she was the perfect friend.<br /><br />I received the next one as an ARC. Looking forward to seeing if they can make it
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Great movie, great soundtrack. You have to watch it a couple times to really get this movie and youll enjoy watching it even more with friends

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Another exciting book from Dan Brown.  This book is set in Washington , D.C.  From the very start this book will grip you and hold your interest from beginning to end.
B0091REZMW|4.0|diamonds are hard to get otherwise you must purchase them with real money and that kind of sucks..if you like finding images in pictures then this will be a fun game for you
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Our entire family loved this film.  We have boys 11 and 14 and they have already watched it a second time.  Sweet story.  Highly recommend it!

B009IEXKXI|4.0|Good read, well done. I really enjoyed it. It was very entertaining and as a nerd I really found it fun...
B0064MGU98|5.0|I found the first 5 seasons on Amazon while searching for something to watch on my I-Pad. Having never watched the series I found myself enthralled. I started last Friday night and have completed all of Season 1 and week 1 and 2 of Season 2. This is interesting, amusing and entertaining.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|The cast is great and the DVD extras are fantastic.  Well worth the price. I only wish it was longer.
0709058764|5.0|Great for pros and beginners alike- book goes into details about things like how to use hide glue and joining slabs for the tops and back as well as innumerable other subjects. Includes detailed descriptions of every step. You will pick up a lot from this book! Book is worth it for the photography alone.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Excellent condition and it comes with a dvd copy definatly the method of choice for home media especially if you liked scott pilgram
B004QX07G4|5.0|I loved this book. I laughed out loud reading it on several occasions, even in public where people looked at me like<br />I was slightly crazy. Ellen is extremely witty and charming and if you have enjoyed her sense of humor watching her on television, surely you will enjoy her as an author as well. She does a great job transferring over her humor into her writing and you begin to feel like she is just another friend. This book I a very quick read that will have you coming back for more.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I recently rented this movie!  Awesome!  I'm not sure what the complaints are about it.  Sure, there are slow parts, but there's also plenty of action.  I saw this same movie at Wally World for $19.  I hope Amazon catches on and lowers the price.  I would rather buy from Amazon.  Also, I heard an extended version is coming out at Christmas.  Not sure if that is true.  I know I double-dibbed plenty on the LOTR movies!  Actually, I may have triple-dipped!  Worth the money, though.  A very fun opener for the new trilogy.
B004QSQML8|5.0|A few reviewers claim that the Ultimate Edition contains only the Director's Cut.  WRONG.  You get BOTH the \\"Theatrical\\" and the \\"Director's Cut\\".<br />> Yes, the director's cut is a bit disappointing in that it really doen't add much.  But it is interesting, and the Theatrical version on Bluray is stunning. Think of the \\"Director's Cut\\" as an \\"extra feature\\"<br /><br />COMPARISON OF THE DIRECTOR'S CUT AND THE THEATRICAL VERSION<br />It is fascinating to compare the two versions.  The Tangerine Dream score in the Theatrical version is much better, except for two horrid vocals, totally out of the character of the movie, which ruin the end and the credits.  The Director's cut drags in places, and is improved in the Theartrical version by judicious trimming, but the Theatrical version still drags in the same places.  On the otherhand, what I felt were key scenes in the Director's Cut are missing in the Theatrical version, such as the explanation that \\"Big D\\" has to seduce Lili, not just \\"take\\" her.  Probably in the next version (in 2030) users will have the flexibilty to mix and match various scenes and scores and make their own personal cut.  Tom Cruise's acting remains pained---but there is nothing that can be done about that.<br /><br />SYMBOLISM?<br />Since no one else seems to have mentioned it, did ANYONE notice that the \\"jewel\\" on Lili's ring (which she gives to Jack at the end--at least in the Director's Cut) is a pearl (or maybe an opal) partially covered with a metal hood on one side?<br /><br />IF IT DOESN'T PLAY DON'T SEND IT BACK<br />My Samsung Bluray player refused to play the first copy Amazon sent me (fortunately Amazon accepted my return and sent a replacement), but in the meantime, my Bluray player refused to play \\"Men in Black 3\\", also a curent release (although the rest of my library of blurays play fine).  Solution, unplug the player, wait a minute and then plug it back in.  My player has played hundreds of Bluray movies---and only occassionally messes up on the newest releases.  Obvious buggy programing of the Bluray discs.<br /><br />NO GARBAGE<br />Fortunately the disc comes without trailers or other garbage at the beginning, which normally really annoys me particularly when both the \\"disc menu\\" and \\"next scene\\" are disabled.<br /><br />EDITORIAL<br />Why is it that the idiots who program Blurays can't get it right?  Why does everybody have to invent a new and ever more annoying interface?  On one recent Bluray, I had to choose \\"language\\" before I could even get to the menu screen.  The first generation of Blurays couldn't remember where you stopped, if you had to stopped in the middle of a movie and turn the player off.  Most later Blurays do.  But the most recent Blurays (like this one) have other problems.  \\"Play\\" isn't enough to resume play on this Bluray if you take a bathroom break---you've got to press \\"enter\\".  Similar \\"Disc Menu\\" is disabled on this Bluray for no logical reason, if you accidentally choose \\"Theatrical\\" and you want to see the \\"Director's Cut\\" instead, tough luck. Why is it that early Blurays load quickly, but the latest, like this one take forever?---and just leave you with a blank black screen while they are loading?esses up on the newest releases.

B0070YDOT8|2.0|It's fun but drags on way too long for the you bit you get to play it your lucky if you last ten minutes playing I think they should value their customers more before they lose more
1401233791|5.0|Really liked the book, currently i am reading the second volume and i think i like this one better. Condition of the book was overall good
B00005JNS0|2.0|Finally got my order and put it in to watch .... it skipped so much ... my son was very upset ... the casing was cut all the way up on one side when received.
1416550534|3.0|The writing is quite good, with interesting descriptions of the surroundings and that era of history.....much like Upstairs Downstairs and Downton Abby in those respects. However, as I had read a review stating that it would be something Downton Abby fans would enjoy, I was ultimately disappointed. I found the book quite depressing, frankly....there was little uplifting development in the story line.....most characters came to a sad end. In other words, if you're looking for a &#34;downer&#34;....this is it.  I had the author's other books in my wish list, but after reading this one, I took them out to think those purchases over awhile longer. I doubt that i will order them, unless I read something more positive about their plots than I've read so far. I don't read to be made depressed...I read for enjoyment, enlightenment, and the sheer pleasure of it. This book offered none of those things. Just my opinion...I know there are many rave reviews. I just don't happen to agree.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I love the kill order. It has everything a great story needs. Of all the books I've read, this is one is one  is in my top five.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its very fun. Its not like any other horse game out there. Only have been playing it for a few hours though. Has trouble connecting to facebook.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a great story I had a very hard time putting this book down.  Great charcters.  Would definitely recommend this book
B00BF11STU|1.0|Anyone that has watched this movie, and given it anything more than two stars must be blind, and oblivious to the reality that this is just a bunch of Hollywood BS. Corny, cheesy, full of cliche's and in my opinion, is a straight up propaganda film. IF this operation EVER happened, all of the fluff in this movie would be classified, making this movie a complete piece of fiction. I don't for one second believe Osama Bin Laden was killed during this op. There may have been another purpose, and Bin Laden's name was stamped on it to make it look good. Osama Bin Laden has been dead since 2001. do a little research, you'll be surprised at what you find. There is more evidence that Osama died in 2001-02 than him being killed by Seal Team 6. If you want to be blind to the truth, by all means, numb your brain and watch this garbage.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my favorite game out of all I've played . The only one I've played that tops This is minecraft on the computer.
B00BHMF578|1.0|I fell into the hollywood hype trap and rented this movie.  It was a very slow moving, uninteresting movie. I have no idea how and why it got good ratings other than the fact hollywood likes to pat themselves on their backs. Save your time and don't rent this movie.
B004KZOWEG|5.0|Excellent and higly recomended!<br />The story os the Congo an Leopold iis not very well known, and the author tells it in a very anusing way.

B0052RDHTM|4.0|Very good book.The ressemblance os the social and historical moments is very acquired,You can read it very easily and you can larn history as well.
0380713802|5.0|First the negative stuff:<br />As a linguist, I find Bill Bryson's works on language to be sadly riddled with errors.  I therefore also mistrust his works on science, and have found occasional errors in his travel books.<br />Now for the positive stuff:<br />Fortunately, I first 'met' Bryson through his travel books.  I have never read travel literature I have enjoyed more.  Bryson is by turns hilarious, thoughtful, irritating and very good at description.  But no matter what his mood at any given time, he is always entertaining.  Neither Here nor There is a wonderful guide to Europe based on three trips Bryson made there: once alone after high school, once with a friend the next year, and the last many years after he had married and settled in England.<br />Notes from a Small Island is a guide to Great Britain written just before he and his family moved -- temporarily -- to America.<br />In a Sunburned Country covers a much larger country, Australia, during which Bryson is sometimes on his own, sometimes accompanied by colleagues, and sometimes with friends.<br />I heartily recommend his travel books, even for those who don't particularly enjoy reading travel books.
B00683JK9K|3.0|Loaded it on my Acer A500.  Fun game but has some significant bugs.  It's slow for starters, it takes several tries to move pieces, and it intermittently crashes meaning you lose everything you've done unless you go back to the menu and re-select the puzzle.
B0046BQ06W|4.0|As always My Chemical Romance delivered an awesome album that changed their sounds & had them experiment more than ever before! I feel they pulled it off but then again I've been a fan practically since they began :) I'm not mad or too upset that they recently broke up, I just felt it was rather shocking...but I want them to be happy with whatever art they continue to make, because they WILL continue to make art, I can assure you that :)<br /><br />xo
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a fun, easy quick read. I loved the passion portrayed in this book and I am sure you will enjoy it too.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have played this for a long time on the computer. I love it on the Kindle. I have not had any issues with it. If you like bingo this is a great game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun connecting the dots. I like the way it teases my brain and gets more and more difficult as you go.
B00BFV1K0M|5.0|Catching Fire was incredibly suspenseful and had some amazing, unexpected twists. Brilliantly written, and can't wait to read the next book in the series!
030758836X|3.0|Crazy but compelling in its own way.  The dialogue is rough, and the plot has its flaws, but one wants to find out how it finishes.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app serves it's purpose with ease of use and conveniant design. The size of the keys are a plus for us seniors that have to look through bifocles.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like playing this game. I enjoy creating my own<br />buildings and villages. I don&#34;t like that it doesn't have any monsters.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|Amazing story! Loved the way it was set out, felt like a true story. Thankyou Amazon for letting me download at such a cheap price.
B00985E3UG|5.0|This book does go into technical detail, however it is still easy to follow.  The takeaways:<br />We eat too little fresh produce. We consume too much sugar. Too much salt. Too much bad fats. Food can be manipulated to be as addictive as narcotics
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't know why everyone was up in arms about this book. I've read paranormal fantasy/urban fantasy that would make this book's toes curl. YAWN.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great follow up from the first book. This is my third time reading it and I grasp something new every time. Great book to read with a older teen and talk about.

B000ZMVAXO|5.0|Wow, this little thing blew away my expectations. Way better then amplitube or any of that crap. When I can't play my half stack 6595+/Mesa at night in uh this I'm and it blows me away how heavy it sounds. It has a very full tubeish sound, flip on the neck pup and you have the les Paul bluesy sound, back on the bridge and play some Metallica Pantera or whatever metal style you play without worrying about the neighbors. Awesome.
B001HQZJPM|1.0|when i need the movies i find i want to order. but don't make me have a minimum of words
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Bought this for my husband. He used it the other day to batton wood, and said it scared the wood apart!!!
B0088W6Y7K|3.0|I enjoyed SG Atlantis as a whole.  When the series first ran i missed it. The only episodes i seen first run was from season 5. Watching those episodes peaked my interest to watch the whole series. I am glad that i did. Back to season 5: it was a recap of the entire series; closing story lines; an effort to strenghten characters personalities.  It was a mixture  of storylines that after watching the previous seasons you may find a bit uninteresting.
B0083ZRAJS|1.0|Love the idea of audio books - but impossible to figure out how to listen to them.  For some reason, I can download on my iphone but not my Ipad?  really?  Too much of a hassle, and will not be purchasing again.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My son can play it and once you get to the higher levels it gets harder. It makes you think.
B004GYNPL2|1.0|Terribly unstable product.  I trusted it to keep my passwords and data safe, but twice so far it has corrupted my data and prevented me from accessing it.  I don't recommend it and will now search for something else that can hold up the claim of allowing backups.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I am not big on reading historical fiction books. But this story really touches my heart and I have no doubt it will touch yours. Liesel kept saying alles gut. But it's not. I dare you to try to read it and feel very emotion she feels. I have done so four times and will reread it again.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved this book years and years ago and still love it after coming back again to relive it. Now I hear they are making a movie out of it as well. Can't wait!
B0044I6FZI|5.0|Season 4 did in my opinion even improve from season 3 and is definitely worth watching it.<br /><br />Streaming in HD whenever I want to watch it is a great Amazon service.
0783225792|2.0|the SD version of this with the red ribbon across the bottom of the case (Widescreen) is of absolutely horrendous picture quality.  don't by this DVD, it's a waste of money.  hard to believe they'd even sell something of this quality.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I only hope that somewhere out there is a man like Jack Reacher.  This is one of the Best yet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a great game. very entertaining. my daughter and I both have this game downloaded to our phones and tablets. would reccommend to any one.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book contains a great amount of suspense and I would recommend it to all my friends that love thriller or mystery books.<br /><br />Go for it.
B0016YBFZ8|2.0|this pertains to the SD version.  paid $5 for this and even at that price, feel i've been ripped off.  picture quality is horrible.  on rear of case at the bottom,in faint light blue says \\"Disc made in Mexico.\\"  that answers that question.  Amazon should remove this from the store.
1476733953|5.0|The fact that the traditional publishing industry failed to recognize and support Hugh Howey is further proof of their imminent demise.  Howey is a writer of exceptional skill and craft and \\"Wool\\" is proof positive of that.<br /><br />The mark of a good writer in any genre is creating flesh blood characters that engage both your intellect and emotions.  Howey succeeds brilliantly in both those areas.  Like so many lesser Sci Fi writers, Howey could have gotten away with the mere creation of the dystopian world of \\"Wool\\" and neglected the all important 'human' element. What makes the \\"Wool\\" so compelling are its complicated and complex, three dimensional characters that draw you in and never let go.<br /><br />I look forward to reading anything that comes out of Howey's brain for years to come.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Greatest TV show/book adaptation of all time. Literally, if you have not watched this/ own it on DVD - buy it now! Like RIGHT Now. Seriously, stop reading these reviews, and order it NOW! Why are you even reading this? Just order this season, and it will not disappoint.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|This movie not only provides some nice moments but also entertains you with great visual effects, good acting and simple amazing entertainment.
B00B7IJDMA|1.0|Wake me when the Bear McCreary OST is released. This seriously should have been Disc 2 included in that version.
B000C8VE14|5.0|Arctic Monkeys are British rascals that like to play loud and fast and that's why I love them!!!! For this being their first album is mind blowing. Between Alex Turner's lyrics of going out and meeting the same girls he did the week before, the funky bass lines, and catchy riffs from both guitars and drums, it's nearyl impossible to not only fall in love with the Arctic Monkeys and see what their other albums have to offer. For anyone who has listened to their White Stripes and Strokes albums too much here is the next step in my generations great rock bands.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|'JT is Killing It on 'The 20/20 Experience!' The Music here is definitely some of the BEST that he has recorded and I LOVE the Sounds, the Looping of the Rythms, the Length of the Songs, the INS&OUTS of JT's Voice and the Flow of the Music on Every track. JT is One of the Most Talented Artist in the Industry and he is the CLOSEST Artist to Michael Jackson at Present. JT is a Consumate Entertainer...Very Versatile! Singer. DANCER. Actor. Comedic. Spontaneous. And, these are the Things that make him Great at what he does and the MOST like MJ! 'The 20/20 Experience' continues to show us that JT is Awesome and that he is on track to give us Music that will make us MOVE and 'Tear Up the DANCE Floor' and Music that is Awesome Today and will be Tomorrow. Timbalands Production is IMMACULATE!!! 'JT, Keep Killin' Em! You have One of your BIGGEST Fans right here!'<br /><br />If you don't have IT, GET THIS ALBUM TODAY and Be MOVED!!!<br /><br />-PM Bishop
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I can find only one fault with this game...the score vanishes too soon upon completion of the game.  But it's good exercise for my brain. I play it a lot.
B00BS4RGFE|5.0|Blake, once more you show why you are one of the top performers of this decade! Fantastic album! Love it!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like these puzzles for those times when you just want something relaxing to do. Love the beautiful epics to assemble.

B008SVS0K0|5.0|Billy Talent is just great. Although frist I was thinking the 2 first albums are better. But once you get used to the slightly changed sound, it's great.
B004I4H8QS|5.0|I had bought this album when it came out originally and could not wait to get this re-issue with the bonus CD. Well, this did not disappoint at all! Fantastic album!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great 2nd book in the series! More action, more twists....leaves me yearning for the 3rd in the series. Sylvia Day delivers yet another great read
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is full of romance, adventure, trickery, humor, and partial mystery. His books are amazing.They are action-packed books. If you have read any of my reviews( reviewer name stormdude) then you should read the book and comment on my reviews by writing on a review. Also, if you aren't a reader, than I suggest reading  his books and you will want to read more of Rick Riordan's books amd others.<br />  -SD
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Great movie, if you haven't seen it, then watch it! Don't forget to watch the first one though! =D &#60;3
B00AECGQF2|5.0|The game is amazing!! But it NEEDS more characters. All the other ones.get boring after a while. So ya. Its still great though.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book was referred by a friend and I wasn't sure what to expect from it. As I got further into the book it became harder to put it down. If I was to compare it to anything it would be mixture of The Power of Now and The Noticer.  I highly recommend this book as it teaches your mind and soul. As well shows appreciation for looking at things from a different perspective.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I think this book was awesome. It was also exciting and was great to read one of his best.... although all his books are amazing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really fun. I would recommend it to people who like games like temple run. a good part is its free!!!!!! adults can play this as<br /><br /> well as kids
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Oh my goodness, it was earth shattering, heartbreaking, heartwarming, and wonderful. I could put it down! It is the best book .  I am so glad I read this one ! I can't say enough good for it. If you haven't read this one read it, it is more than you can imagine.
B009XTF8JM|3.0|There are so many bad horror movies out there.  This one is not one of them.  Without giving away the whole movie, I can say that there are some scary parts that do not lean too much on sight gags and things jumping out at the screen.  The acting is good.  The father is believable, and the daughter does a great job.<br /><br />If you like horror movies, this is a good one for you.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My mom told me I could play on her kindle fire HD and all she had w as this. I told her it would be lame but I tried it and loved it. It's truly awesome!!!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game if u like running.  It's almost the same as temple run but a lot better.
0061353248|5.0|Very useful information at any walk in life.  The author's experiments are very well thought out and found the results worth consideration.  It is always good to be aware of what drives your behavior as well as those around you
B009CF7GRY|5.0|It was almost like the older one but I loved the actor's in this one too thought it was a good movie
1594487154|5.0|Still believing in sales techniques of the 60's and 70's is like listening to music on a cassette recorder. I actually went to youtube and pulled up the famous \\"always be closing\\" speech from Alec Baldwin. I had forgotten how depressing that movie was and the dreary rain outside the window compounded it.<br /><br />As with many others on this site I am a Dan Pink fan. Each of his books have been great reads. In one way they are interconnected and yet they each are different subjects. The new ABC's (attunement, buoyancy and clarity) sum up the major changes we face in the sales or persuading industries. The world in general realizes that empathy is our most needed value.<br /><br />While Dan is not a social scientist by trade he does a great job of curating this information for us.<br /><br />I had the opportunity to see Dan live in Indianapolis a few years back. He is one of the few authors that is as entertaining on stage as he is in the pages of his book.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Don't go into it expecting Lord of the Rings. It is a wonderful story with characters you've grown to love and new characters you will be sure to love quite easily. It's a different tale completely. I think people who don't rate it high simply went into it expecting more of Lord of the Rings. Open your mind and your heart will follow. It's great!
0545425115|5.0|Very interesting concept and indepth characters. It kept me interested (which is hard to do if the story is just so-so).
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I would love to see better rider outfits, or maybe... can you just give an option to hide the hats? I dislike the one of the 10.000 outfit pretty much
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It is a great Movie. This movie stands up to the test of time. I would recommend this Movie to any one.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Pat peoples is as hopeful as Forest Gump,  it's a mix of very identifiable yet bizarre characters that draw you into their world of sports fanatics, honest friendships,  unconditional family love and bonds. Life truly has its desperate moments as captured by this book but that there are reasons and there are closures to be made so we can write that next chapter of our lives.
0307346609|5.0|I love, love, love zombies and this book was not a letdown. Now that I have read this engaging story, I can't wait to see it on the big screen.
B008EEBBIY|5.0|I saw Family of the Year play in San Francisco, and bought this album the next day! Every song is fantastic; even better having the visual of the band playing them live! BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00005K9LK|5.0|They are great. Judas Priest stands up to the test of time. I would recommend this CD to any one.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I love this style of game. This one is really fun. However, I couldn't find any instruction on how to play and pass levels. I'm not an experienced &quot;gamer&quot; so that was frustrating. If I missed where to view instructions, please let me know. Other than that, I'd say give it a go!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|My daughter bugged and bugged me to sit down and watch this with her. I finally relented and was glad I did. This movie is too funny and it is very hard to make me laugh. Highly recommend.
0452273331|5.0|I loved this book! I was totally engaged from start to finish, and wanted it to continue. Regardless of whether you agree with Rand's political views or not, Fountainhead is a well written book that everyone should read.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really liked this book and finished it too soon!! I wish there was more books!! Just sad how the book ended!!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I couldn't wait for this to come out on DVD. This movie is too funny, highly engaging, and even had me drawn into the story line. I love Santa! He was a hoot. I loved the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. Oh, baby tooth, how adorable she was. Awesome movie!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Each story has an interesting ending and I can't wait for the movie to be released on DVD. Hopefully May? The trailer for the movie is what made me want to read the book, so I hope they follow through with the May 14 release date...
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I had goosebumps on my entire body, except face, watching this thriller. Even as the movie closed I still had goosebumps.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I l love it it allows me to get off when ever and were ever I want. Good luck with it I hope you enjoy
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved these characters! Nicholas Sparks is an engaging author! I even liked the villian, Deputy Keith Clayton. It says a lot about an author when he or she can make you like the bad guy. I highly recommend this read!

B004HXIZVC|5.0|I use soundcloud to share my music with others, and I like to listen to what other people have out there.  Great App, and growing community.
B002BBJ52U|5.0|This is one of my favorite romantic movies.  I think Ginnifer Goodwin (Snow White, [[ASIN:B005XN3150 ONCE UPON A TIME]]) is amazing here, Ben Affleck too, everyone in top form, including Bradley Cooper, though playing an unlikable character, and charming Justin Long as Ginnifer Goodwin's love interest (Long played the nerdy teen advising Tim Allen & Sigourney Weaver via communicator-\\"Just push the blue button!\\"- in [[ASIN:B007QA3AH2 Galaxy Quest]]). Though there are multiple stories told, the characters are well-developed, in relation to each other, in many pithy, seminal scenes.  Great, natural dialogue.<br /><br />Personally, I think this movie superior to LOVE, ACTUALLY- more natural, less contrived.  Note, for example, the great subtlety and yet significance of the scene in which Bradley Cooper declines Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette.  Another reason I love this is the strong chemistry between all the characters, friends as well as lovers.  And the ending- where all the loose ends are tied up- not just one happy ending but several- perfectly punctuated by Keane's marvelous \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\", followed by the Cure, wonderful (the music throughout the film is great).  And be SURE to stay tuned for the credits, because the movie continues for a few minutes after they begin to roll, indeed, some of the best scenes.<br /><br />I read a few of the negative reviews and on reflection, I must say that I didn't find this movie funny either- honest, charming and moving, yes- funny, no.<br /><br />I enjoyed the deleted scenes, hearing the director's rationale for deleting them.  They would've detracted from the flow, true, but provide great backstory so watch them if you like the film (btw, the one with Scarlett Johannson singing in the cocktail lounge appears to have been filmed in the Observation Bar on the Queen Mary).  There's an entire subplot involving Johansson's character, with Theresa Russell ([[ASIN:B00AGE5P0U Black Widow]]) playing her mother- intriguing, and very interesting why director Ken Kwapis decided to cut it.  Only one small quibble do I have about the movie, and that involves being taken aback by some of the awful hair styles sported by the women (Goodwin and Johansson in particular), and in some cases, poor makeup (and/or lighting).  Granted, everybody doesn't have to look perfect all the time, but it's quite a feat to make these beautiful women look haggard, as they do in several scenes (not Goodwin, she's radiant, it's her hair that's atrocious).  But that's minor- this movie has romance, heart, charm, and wisdom, in my humble opinion.  Granted, it's not exactly a feminist manifesto, but even so, it makes some VERY incisive observations about relations between the sexes.  I dare say a large percentage of people in this world spend an inordinate amount of time looking for someone to love and love them, the central theme of the film.<br /><br />There was one misstep in that in one scene Johannson storms out of Ben's office without bothering to put her dress back on, that might have raised a few eyebrows.  Lastly, I would have found it satisfying had Jennifer Connolly ended up with Javier, but that didn't happen, darn it.  I think you'll find this well worth your time, and you won't soon forget the characters and what happens to them.g why director Ken Kwapis decided to cut it.

0553386794|5.0|Game of Thrones is an awesome series to read! There are sooo many more details in the book that isn't in the HBO series. The story line is engaging and the characters are well developed. I love reading the book over watching a series being made or a movie. You get a chance to &#34;see&#34; what that person is thinking and the struggles they endure, or what really motivates his or her actions. Excellent read!
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I bought this album to complete my collection of an artist that never achieved the recognition he was due.  This album is good but not as good as his first--Cold Fact but it does have some tasty lyrics.  Also the auto rip feature from Amazon is great.  I downloaded the album immediately and received the CD which is still wrapped.  Makes it great for collectors.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this series, I loved the books growing up and this series does the stories justice. I hope this goes on for many more seasons!
B002BWP49M|5.0|Part one and part two Breaking Dawn are the best in my opinion of the series...<br />Item was shipped quickly...
B0000UJDLM|5.0|This movie is still as good as it was when it first came out! A must see! Bought this for our daughter's birthday and SHE LOVE'S IT!!!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|This is another great Depeche Mode album.  It has a similar feel to the past few Depeche releases, but has a more a blues/goth rock feel to it. I love it! While the book style case design is cool, it is difficult to get the discs out without scratching them. I uploaded them to my digital library, so it's not a huge deal, but it could be frustrating for those who still listen to CDs regularly.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|for those of us who are different yet trendy this is a great cd to play while driving or for friends
B003E2UQMS|3.0|Nice, enjoyable story but too predictable and written in what seemed to me a teenager's English...  Curious to know why so much hype about the movie.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see this film in the theater, and my review is based off of that.  I head grumblings from various people about the very long run-time of the movie (around 3-1/2 hours), but that did not bother me, and actually I learned my lesson once before when I refused to go see \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" in the theater due to its length, and later viewed it on DVD and loved it.  So first off, don't let the length scare you off.  In this case, the length only enhances the experience, as you truly become engrossed in the story...I came out of the movie wanting more.<br /><br />Another negative I heard going in, was that the movie jumped around a lot, and that it was distracting and hard to follow.  True it did jump around a bit, between the different stories told in different time periods, but I found that neither hard to follow, nor distracting.  In fact, I found it masterful the way the stories all tied in to one another, and the flow of the story in and out of these periods kept my interest peaked at all times.  I hate to use the cliche that it is a \\"thinking person's movie\\", but it is.  It is not something to kill a few hours watching for something to do, it is an experience.<br /><br />The casting, the acting, the costume, and special effects were all great, and I would give them all 5-stars on their own, but it was none of those that made me enjoy this movie as much as I did, it was the story.  It was happy, it was sad, it was funny, it was inspiring, and it was action-packed, all in one (or should I say all in six).  I felt a real connection to the characters in this film, which I find to be rare these days.  This is a story for action fans, drama fans, sci-fi fans, thriller fans, it really is a story for a broad base of movie-goer.  The overall grandeur of the experience of this film was like few others for me, and I can honestly rank this in the top 10, maybe even top 5 movies I have seen, ever.  Do yourself a favor and buy this movie, because you will want to watch it again and again., because you will want to watch it again and again.
0307960471|2.0|To begin with, I am not a fan of Jo Nesbo's books.  One reviewer on the cover states that the book is \\"exciting.\\"  After I was half way through the story I was wondering when it would end.  The story drags, has too many unnecessary diversions.  It is these dull periods that disconnect me from the story.  Ian Rankin is a favorite of mine.  He never seems to disappoint.  He holds me to the story he is telling. I doubt if I will read any more of Nesbo's books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I mush it was for free and u don't have to pay 6.99 for it and it is crazy on the price. and I love the game but I think it should also be for free to instead of paying for it!!!!!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This one is a Tom's Hardware recommend and I completely agree.  Games do not use the hyper-threading that the I7 provides, but they do benefit from the overclocking that this processor supports.  Do your research and save your money, get this processor over the i7 and play smart!
B002ZBRSMK|4.0|As a sci-fi buff, and big fan of movies from the 70's and 80's, this movie looked interesting.  Throw in the super-eccentric David Bowie, a young Rip Torn, and a very cute young supporting actress Candy Clark (who I had never heard of before), and this was a must see.  All I can say is that this movie was over-the-top weird and bizarre, but I loved it.  Definitely a must-see for those of you who like oddities.  I seriously don't think this movie would work, however, without Bowie...he really makes it, because he is such an odd character to begin with.  From what I have read, he was stoned out of his gord throughout most of the filming, and that comes as no suprise to me.<br /><br />Overall I liked it, had a few things been different, I could have loved it.  First, I would have liked to see a better backstory, rather than Bowie coming to earth, then all the sudden in the next scene he is already meeting with a lawyer to patent his ideas from his home planet that eventually make him a technology mogul.  The story jumps around a bit towards the end like that too.  The main thing I could have done without is what amounts to basically soft-porn scenes with Rip Torn, and all the male nudity.  Yes, I understand in the 70's this was edgy and artistic, but that doesn't make it any less gross.  That said, I do however recommend the movie to any lover of cheesy sci-fi, or 1970's funkiness.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Mis&eacute;rables is an amazing movie that touches anyone who lays their eyes upon such cinematic triumph. The acting was superb and the singing was just amazing. The story being sad and miserable still has hope, a great message and humorous moments. I bought this movie and already seen it twice, downloaded the soundtrack and it's always in my mind. It's a wonderful movie and its raw emotion leaves its mark on you. Strongly recommend it.
B00AA03D18|5.0|There's a reason why Proof of Heaven by Dr. Eben Alexander has spent week after week on the New York Times best seller list. It's full of fascinating insight about the mysteries of the mind, consciousness, and the inter-relationship of the physical and spiritual worlds.<br /><br />The book is based on Dr. Alexander's out of body experience (OBE) while he lay in a coma in the intensive care unit in the hospital where he worked as a neurosurgeon. He was suffering from a rare form of bacterial meningitis from which recovery is rare. Miraculously, after seven days with no apparent brain activity, he recovers with a jolt, just as his caregivers are preparing to withdraw life support.<br /><br />He returns with vivid memories of his experiences in a heavenly world characterized by a bright vivid landscape where he was guided by an angelic young woman and where he senses the higher powers of unconditional love. Unlike most other OBE experiences, he has no sense of his identity in the physical world and was not greeted by long lost family members. At least so he initially thinks. However, he later comes to understand that the angelic woman who guided him was a birth sister of whom he had not previously been aware.<br /><br />Before his life-altering experience Dr. Alexander was skeptical about such OBE accounts, considering them merely a function of the dying brain. After it he was a changed man eager to record the awe-inspiring world and the presence of God to which he had been exposed. He now recognizes that, far from being an unimportant by-product of physical processes (as he had previously believed), \\"consciousness is not only very real it's actually more real than the rest of physical existence and most likely the basis of it all.\\" His journey of understanding continues to the benefit of his readers.<br /><br />Barry Francis

B00B69UQEO|1.0|I'm only adding a review out of habit, having been a one-time HUGE fan of the group, yet habit seems to the only motivation the band has for continuing to churn out such rubbish these days.  Look, I just simply don't get the positive reviews this albums is getting.  Really???  Are we listening to the same thing?  I've heard better melodies emanate from my garbage disposal.  It's the kind of sound a decomposing squirrel might make.  It's no accident that the song titles include \\"broken\\", \\"slow\\" and \\"should be higher\\".  My guess is most of these songs were collected off the cutting room floor of the Playing the Angel sessions.  Listen, if we stop supporting this, maybe they'll get the hint and stop producing such dreck. Depeche went off the rails after Ultra and this is the absolute smelliest hairball that they have vomited up in the absolute worst decade of their existence.  Boo!!
0765334798|3.0|I enjoyed Redshirts enough to finish it, but on the whole it is not a fabulous book. My great affection for Star Trek is probably what kept me going. Parts of it are four stars and others two. The premise is intriguing and amusing, but it ran on too long. I had a very hard time following what happened to resolve things in chapter 22, but I often have trouble following science fiction TV show plots too, so that's not unusual. I think the book would have been stronger without the three Codas at the end.<br /><br />If you are a fan of television science fiction, especially Star Trek, and like the idea of seeing the Redshirts as the stars for once, you might enjoy this book.
B006IS6CK0|4.0|\\"Mogambo\\" features three of Hollywood's (at the time) greatest stars (Gable, Gardner and up-and-coming Kelly) in a love trilogy set in Africa. What separates this film from others of the genre is, of course, John Ford. At the top of his game, Ford was known not only as a consummate story teller, but an expert in creating a \\"visual universe\\" for the viewer....the Africa he captures transports the viewer to that continent, the sights and sounds becoming part of the experience. Performances are uniformly excellent---particularly supporting actors, and, as always with a John Ford production, the storyline is compelling and fast-paced. Although references to natives as \\"boys\\" and the frequent portrayal of the slaughter of wild animals will make 21st century viewers cringe a bit, the story is superb and worth a second (even third viewing).....Ford was a genius, and this is his picture from beginning to end---to any John Ford fan, that pretty well sums it up.

B007ZTLLMK|3.0|This is a pretty cool game but, you are mostly flying from A to B and landing.  The simulation seems pretty accurate and difficulty is created by requiring you to land the helicopter in narrow spaces.
B000JLTRIQ|5.0|A heart warm movie in based in New York City.The accounts on what happened on sept 2001 at the world trade center it tell you what everyone was doing before the planes hit.It tells what two cops who survived and were trapped for hours until they where found.It also gives you what the families were going through waiting for some kind of word.

B001H1SVO8|4.0|Fight Club is the chaos created by one man with a dissociative personality disorder and it seriously shows the potential for Mental Illness to pervert the world as we know it.<br /><br />The acting was great, I never cared for Ed Norton before this movie but, I really like him as an actor now.  Brad Pitt was cool, reserved and in control or, as in control as the man who wasn't there could be.  Helena Bonham Carter was Marla in a reserved sense but, she still managed to pull it off well.  Meat Loaf Aday as Robert Paulson had a small role in the film but, it was well played and well used to support the story.<br /><br />The screen play was decent but, it lacked some details that helped you understand some things in the movie.<br /><br />For instance, the Mechanic had a larger role in the book than in this story and he helped to explain mind of Tyler Durden as well as being the man who would attempt cut off Ed Norton's Nuts (which wasn't in a police station by the way).  Also, Marla has a series of boyfriends with serious issues and she not only thought the whole split personality was cool but, actually helped Ed Norton stay awake so Tyler couldn't take over his body.  Another point is the fact that the main character realized he had multiple personalities a little more than halfway through the book as the two met in passing, and then he spent most of the rest of the book trying to undo the damage that Tyler had done.  And finally, they left out the fact that Tyler instructed them all to cut people's nuts off if they made any attempt to shutdown Fight Club in any way, and this lead to threats against police chiefs and a fridge full of frozen testicles from people attempting to stop the movement.<br /><br />Overall, they did do a really good job with the movie but, I still recommend you read the book as it builds upon the story and you will actually get a pretty good sense of how the story would really unfold.<br /><br />So, with that said, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you've been living under a rock for the past 13 years and really need to climb out from under there!

0547564651|4.0|This book was recommended to me and so glad I read it.  Character development in children is critical.  I teach high school kids and they lack the ability to persevere and persist when things (assignments, work load, social conflicts) get tough. Although there are no concrete suggestions provided, the author encourages the reader to think about how children succeed and pursue additional research. This book is an excellent read for those in education and individuals outside of education that think teaching is easy.

B008MU8ZNO|5.0|Esta película es un clásico de los creadores de los Critters. Gran película para disfrutar en blu ray. Muy divertida!!!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I found this movie to be awesome! I have read the book several times in my life and really enjoy the story (same with the lord of the rings trilogy). Whenever I get a bug to read these, I start with the hobbit and then read the lord of the rings. When I had heard that they made a trilogy out of just the one book, I was a little skeptical, because I thought they might be milking it. After reading the reviews here, I figured that was what was happening, but it isn't at all! It actually has the depth that the book deserves. It makes me wish the lord of the rings had nine movies (three for each book). Kudos to Mr. Jackson and the crew! Nice job.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Love this soundtrack!  If you liked the books and love the movies, the Soundtracks are a must have!  Get them!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Just like the 1st season, the 2nd season does not dissapoint. Excellent following to the book, and certainly an adult series. I was hooked when I watched it!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I LOVE the Lord of the Rings, and so expected The Hobbit to be good as well. My fear was that something would be different about The Hobbit and that I would not like it as much. My fear was pointless. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was amazing. I cannot wait for the next two movies!
B0055B7K7A|5.0|My girlfriend hadn't seen it so i rented it from Amazon via my PlayStation 3 and she ended up loving it too. The first 10 minutes of the movie is a better and truer love story than most movies can put in two hours.

B0007ZEO4G|4.0|DEEP PURPLE-BURN: British hard rock pioneers DEEP PURPLE were never strangers to change...but when the band rotated members for the third time in less than a decade, few predicted a slam-bang statement like BURN right out of the gate. Lion-maned DAVID COVERDALE's meancing blooze growl, stoked by ex-TRAPEZE bassist GLENN HUGHES' high harmonies, proved a heavy hittin' dream team on the pedal to the fretboards title track, their biggest radio juggernaut since SMOKE ON THE WATER. Deeper tracks including ominous warning MIGHT JUST TAKE YOUR LIFE showcased RICHIE BLACKMORE's and JON LORD's trademark guitar/organ interplay, while MISTREATED, a sleazy seven minute slab of smoldering RNB, smoked with COVERDALE's macho, gutbucket delivery. DEEP PURPLE would soon spin off similar ensembles like RAINBOW and WHITESNAKE, and the group soldiered on in varying formats for decades, but BURN (marred only by the pointless closing instrumental \\"A\\" 200) stands as their last truly great gasp of unmitigated, ball-bruisin' rock and roll.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR CANDLES

B000EHSVS2|5.0|Why do I like this film?  My father once told me a few things about Gen Patton.  Why, you might ask?  For some reason he seem to know quite a lot about this man.  {I was just 10 years old when he commented on Gen Patton}  I learned a little later in life why he knew so much about him.  My father had served under General Patton during WWII.  My father did not have a chance to see the movie but what he had explained to me on what the man had &#34;said, done and acted&#34; were right on.  I was very proud the way it all come together in the film.  I was so true.

0062080237|2.0|With American Gods, Neil Gaiman attempts a very cool premise: An ex-con by the name of Shadow stumbles on the fantastic and often dangerous subterranean world of Old World gods, which is facing the imminent threat of a new order of deities. The novel follows Shadow's Odyssey across America, as he's lead from one curious destination to another by his guide and boss, Wednesday, aka Odin of Norse mythology.<br /><br />Along the way, Gaiman sprinkles in a series of interludes, which flesh out this hidden divine history of America. These sections are far and away the strongest sections of the book; putting Gaiman's gifts as a story teller and knowledge of mythologies and macabre folklore on display.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the main story line is pretty thin. The aggravatingly nicknamed Shadow remains a relatively one dimensional character for the first three quarters of the story, as he is whisked from one inconsequential scene to another by narrative propulsion that relies almost solely on groan inducing coincidences and, somewhat ironically, heavy handed deus ex machina. It's not until the book's final act that Shadow becomes even remotely as interesting as some of the minor characters, and then it's against the backdrop of an astounding anticlimax; putting into question the entire reading experience to that point.<br /><br />It feels like Gaiman wants to say something profound about America, but is never able to articulate himself. The biggest problem is the mythologies the author chooses to focus on. The simple fact is Egyptian and Norse mythology play an extremely minute role in American cultural identity, regardless of the early Viking landings or folktales brought over by immigrants. Meanwhile, the role of Christianity in America or even its role in exterminating, say, Norse, Celtic, or Native American traditions is completely absent from a novel about gods in conflict. Anthropomorphizing modern manifestations of faith like Internet and television is a cool idea, but the fact that the focus of today's major religions are missing (save a brief, unhelpful mention of Jesus)guarantees that the story will remain benign if not downright juvenile; no matter how imaginative Gaiman's use of sex and violence is.<br /><br />Of course, Religion is one of THE hot button issue of our times and it's easy to imagine the ridiculous outrage that would follow a book where Jesus and Buddha were duking it out. At the same time, Gaiman can't even set up a coherent set of rules for his own imaginary universe. Why would a character who does not believe in the gods of Ancient Egypt experience the Egyptian Underworld? Why not the Greek Underworld? Exactly what is the deal with the various permutations of a single God running around the planet? Who in contemporary America is worshiping Odin enough to sustain his existence, anyway? Am I being too critical or this a rather slapdash universe?<br /><br />The biggest problem with American Gods is its posturing as dangerous and edgy when it has absolutely no teeth. It's a big book that doesn't particularly go anywhere, with a premise that never meets its potential. It's a light, innocuous read; the sort of forgettable fluff that's perfect for those long tedious stretches of a cross country trip., but the fact that the focus of today's major religions are missing (save a brief, unhelpful mention of Jesus)guarantees that the story will remain benign if not downright juvenile; no matter how imaginative Gaiman's use of sex and violence is.<br /><br />Of course, Religion is one of THE hot button issue of our times and it's easy to imagine the ridiculous outrage that would follow a book where Jesus and Buddha were duking it out.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The plot thickens and keeps you guessing all the way through. Full of surprises with some disappointment s but a satisfactory end to the whole thing to make sure that you will want to see the movies.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|I wanted to like this so much! I love romantic comedies with some interlaced drama and like both of these actors, but the delivery was super slow, dry and a bit boring. It didn't feel like these two characters had any sizzle, chemistry or future. It was really silly but not in a fun way.

B001VPJYZK|5.0|It was hard to watch Gabriel the first part of this season. I felt so bad for her. But she bounced back. The show was still at its best. I did miss the little kids though from previous seasons. The twins were sooo adorable. But the teenagers added to the show and did a great job.
B00BF11STU|1.0|So many people raved about this film so I watched it. I put aside the fact this is pure propaganda and tried watching this with an open mind, but it really wasn't that good. Even the so called adrenaline packed ending was disappointing. The actors were meh, more belonging to a TV series than an actual movie. And forget about the actual facts, this was just a glossy portrayal of what America does to fight \\"evil\\". Some people were mortified by the torture scenes but I'm sure the reality is much worse. And the raid itself was just a reminder America always acts alone regardless of the consequences.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|I was intrigued about this movie by its synopsis, and after reading others reviews was reluctant.  Dove in and watched it, WOW.  I've never written a review for a movie before, but goddamned.  What a treat this movie was.<br /><br />Spinning the typically bloodly and creepy vampire on its ear, this movie was so much more about the pain that is the vampire life.  Told from a young boy bullied at school, who at first found a true friend, and then an adolescent sexual curiosity leading to true love, this was simply WOW.<br /><br />The cliched glamour of vampires is stripped to the core with this film, as you are prevy to the dark, underside of the life sustained by blood.  Reality is a \\"no-holds barred\\" element, with small doses of human emotion fed to the audience throughout.<br /><br />Look, I'm a fan of horror films for the shock, scare and fear value with a \\"slight\\" penchant for zombie acalyptic genres.  But this movie, was quite possibly one of the BEST movies I've seen in some time.<br /><br />You, the audience, develop a genuine feeling of compassion, sympathy and outright love for the young gal vampire in this movie.  The close up of her eyes at the very end, brought genuine adoration, and the simple blink of her eyes sent me straight over the edge of emotion with a \\"cliched\\" tear from my eye, and big smile of joy on my face.<br /><br />For those interested in horror, there is no shock/gore/japanese spider wall-climbing to be fouund.  But for those who enjoy the genre, this WILL tug at anyone's heart strings as this movie has a spin that I've never seen, nor could conceive of.<br /><br />5 stars, and would likely rewatch soon.

B004BSFSTA|4.0|After a year of solid use to the Marshall Major headphones, I've concluded that these are worth the $93 USD that I had paid for them.<br /><br />I have been following the Marshall company for some time and was happy that they put out the headphones genera. However I wasn't that gun ho about it and let the people buy the headphones and review them first before I even though of buying them.<br /><br />Granted it took a while but the reviews came in and of course they were mixed. However, I took the risk and ordered a pair and to my great satisfaction, they held their worth and price to the dime.<br /><br />It's been over a year and i've shoved them into the bag countless of times. most likely sat on them a couple of times by accident and yet they still held strong like the first time they came out of the box.<br /><br />The good thing about them is that they are extremely portable and versatile. To which I've incorporated the coiled cord many times in the containment of the portability of these headphones.<br /><br />The down side that I've only found so far was that they are tight when you are wearing any glasses of any sort, whether they be sunglass, reading glasses or your prescription glasses. The pressure does build on the ears and will make you take them off frequently if not monitored.<br /><br />However that can be adverted by using any type of head gear ranging from bandanas to beanies to hats of any sort.<br /><br />I would have given a full 5 our of 5 however the glasses issue knocks off a star tot he list.<br /><br />You will get quality from buying these headphones. However don't think that buying these sturdy headphones means that you can then bash them around and abuse them because they WILL FALL APART. Like everything. If you take care of them then you will find amazing results.

081297381X|4.0|In his book, The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable, Dr. Nassim Nicholas Taleb illustrates the truly unpredictable nature of black swan events. He shows how the limits of human imagination and available information hide the possibility of these events from us regardless of the retrospective assertions made by `the experts.' Dr. Taleb goes on to reveal micro-level black swans that influence the day-to-day success and failure of companies and individual employees.<br /><br />The Black Swan brings to the forefront the reality of unpredictable events. Through his proof of their existence, Dr. Taleb creates a mandate for executives and managers to examine and prepare their organization to deal with black swan events at the corporate and employee level.<br /><br />The one shortcoming of Dr. Taleb's book is the absence of a set of guiding protocols or principles for effectively dealing with black swan events once they occur. This remains as an outstanding research and development project for the reader with no initial direction provided.<br /><br />I like The Black Swan for its exposure of unpredictable events and the inferred call to action to prepare one's organization to deal with these catastrophes commensurate with the organization's overall risk profile; making The Black Swan a StrategyDriven recommended read.<br /><br />All the Best,<br />Nathan Ives<br />StrategyDriven Principal
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Have been following all the seasons. Like with any good show that keeps you coming back, the walking dead, keeps you asking the question, who's next?  Did you ever consider that the show is a reflection about the rest of the world? We tend to act like brainless Zombies, don't we?
0143118757|4.0|Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In by Roger Fisher and William Ury recognizes that professionals are in a frequent state of negotiation and provides them with the tools needed to achieve a desirable outcome. This book probes many diverse negotiation circumstances from both sides of the debate and offers constructive, easy-to-follow methods to achieve one's desired outcomes by:<br /><br />- Disentangling the people from the problem<br />- Focusing on interests, not positions<br />- Working together to find creative and fair options<br />- These methods help the reader negotiate with anyone at any level of their organization.<br /><br />I believe that negotiation is a key component to individual and organizational success. Getting to Yes breaks down these give and take situations; providing the immediately actionable tools needed to achieve a favorable outcome and making these situations less intimidating. If I had one criticism of the book, it would be that the authors seek to achieve a `fair' or `equitable' outcome for each side. While this appears admirable, it forfeits an upside gain that an effective negotiation might be able to otherwise achieve.<br /><br />Getting to Yes provides a thorough, actionable negotiation tool set that is critical to every professional and organization's success; making it a StrategyDriven recommended read.<br /><br />All the Best,<br />Nathan Ives<br />StrategyDriven Principal
B007HJ9LXE|3.0|Strange life of a strange artist who projects her pain (and weirdness) through her art. Very visual, and good acting.
0062082353|5.0|The book is hard to put down and is a must read for all that or proud to be Americans.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Don't have (or want) cable. Have to wait for this each season. Wish HBO would offer them an episode at a time (like the walking dead) TNT. Read all the books, and waiting for Martins last book!  Spoiler: Is John Snow really dead?
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Game is not easy, but it brings joy upon solving hard puzzles. It's about making sure that colored train gets to a right color depot without wrecking them and using the least amount of detours or stop sign.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Good movie. If I could watch it all at once id be happy.... keeps timing out every ten minutes.... Somehow Netflix works though. Worst 4.00 I've ever spent... Haven't been able to finish the movie and its been like 15 hours... let me watch 5 minutes here 5 minutes there.. So much fun...
B007PKDW44|5.0|Its hard to find the things my husband likes the most. So I always look on Amazon and here it was, my husbands favorite band and the cd hes been looking for, for months. Very good cd and a band worth giving a listen. :)
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Pretty cool. I like having the option to pick my own wake up music. I like all of the options that are available.
B00005O3VC|4.0|I got this as a gift for my husband because its one of his favorite movies. He told me I was in for a surprise and I was. It was actually a pretty funny movie. It was made in the 70's so you have to over look the bad graphics and acting but it has some really good parts. Worth watching at least once.
B000XUBC5E|1.0|I read and enjoyed several of Coban's earlier non-Bolitar books and enjoyed them, but this one was a real disappointment. The protagonist is essentially the same guy as Mickey Bolitar, and the plot has way too many coincidences that are never justified. I could (and did) put it down.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting!  My only gripe is getting stung by jellyfish or attacked by high level sharks.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Okay so at first this was super fun. TR2 is one with an improvement in every category plus more unlocks. Now every time I boot the damn thing up it crashes. Yay for the Kindle home page... I sure am seeing a lot of it now.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I'm a huge fan of \\"dead\\" films, and yet I've never seen the actual walking dead show.  I decided to get these for my kindle fire hd and LOVE IT.  The story in volume one was just enough to keep you wanting more, to find out why the characters are at this point.  It really makes you feel connected with them also, thinking that they could be your neighbors, co workers, friends....  a must read for anyone,  even if your not a fan of genre!
B00AYR2FOI|1.0|Is Boz Scaggs on smack or something? Virtually no new original music since \\"Dig,\\" which is twelve years old. Couldn't he have come up with one new song a year during that time, thereby sparing us this exercise in self-indulgent, mail-it-in crap? I've been listening to Mr. Scaggs since his days with Steve Miller, and I'll go to see him when he comes around this summer to mine this CD for all that he can, but I'll be praying to the god in whom I do not believe that he'll go light on his cover stuff. \\"I Just Go\\" from the aforementioned \\"Dig\\" has more soul and is more evocative than all the covers on \\"Memphis\\" and on Mr. Scaggs' last two \\"cover\\" CDs put together. I am unanimous in that.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I watched the movie when I had only read the first half of the book.  Big mistake but I still enjoyed the book very much.  At times it was hard to put down.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is the real story....not the Hollywood version.  It is very different from the movie, and it is a great quest story.  It reminds me that it is important to stay true to oneself and keep looking for &#34;home.&#34;
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|A very good book full of mystery and adventure as the group of seven tries to save their friend nico
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|The episodes are well written and the characters continue to develop throughout the first season.  Summer does a good job as a female terminator.  It is interesting how the menace changes.  The cast and supporting players are strong.  The development of John Conner is realistic and supports how he &#34;grows&#34; into the job.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|Really enjoy this movie. Watch it time and again and also a good experience. Jodie Foster's character is well developed, interesting and well acted. Matthew McConaghy's laid back scientist/&#34;man of the cloth without the cloth&#34; is a great foil to her analytical, answer seaking character.
B009A87Z6U|1.0|I am unsure why this Blu Ray/DVD cannot be played in my Australian blu ray playwer as I also bought Casino Royale and this can be played.
030758836X|4.0|I'm giving this four stars because of the enjoyment factor--I looked forward to reading it and found myself wanting to flip a few pages forward on many occasions (\\"What is going to happen?!\\"). To me, that is a great read. There's a difference though between a great read and great book; this is the former and not the latter. As a devotee of the crime procedural dramas on TV and any good British mystery, I found this novel pretty lacking. My recommendation is to read this book if you're looking for something intriguing/thrilling and kind of fun (crazy, even), but don't hold out hope for a fantastic plot with a slam-bang ending.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love to use this app. It is very handy and I love the different tools included with this great application.
B003G4W49C|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this wonderful novel? I regret having not enjoyed it sooner, only discovering it (and the author) in my 30s. It's a timeless story that has aged well after three decades, and will soon be released as a film in 2013.<br /><br />What I like about the story is how the children learn to work together and progress slowly as the story unfolds, so the reader is made to share in their victories and losses. Also like that Card predicted children in future school would use an iPad-like tablet for their lessons. Not the first author to use the idea, but the first as far as I know to use a tablet entirely with touch/voice input. But that's ancillary...<br /><br />The strength of this novel is the character development. By the end, you really can empathize with what each individual child is going through, Ender, Bean, and the others. Highly recommend reading Ender's Shadow NEXT, rather than the so-called official sequel, Speaker for the Dead, which is a wholly different sci-fi story in another vein entirely. A good story, but disappointing if one is hoping for more Ender's Game. Shadow, on the other hand, is a direct parallel story from the viewpoint of Bean!<br /><br />Having read this about 10 years ago now, I intend to read it again on Kindle and go through the whole series again!
B000ZP6MIY|5.0|Bought 2 pairs.  One for me for the kitchen, I am studying to be a pastry chef and feel very comfortable while protect me from hot things falling.<br /><br />The other pair is for my niece who is already doing her practices at a hospital.  Both of us are happy with our purchase.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I completely enjoyed this novel and now consider it one of my all-time favorite stories which I will read again and again! (Up there with Blood Music, Forever War, and Ender's Game). In fact, it's been about a year now, and I've been exploring other authors, but soon I will re-read this and pick up a bunch more Scalzi works now that the publisher has dropped the price of Kindle books.<br /><br />By \\"fun\\", I mean the book is very easy to read, moves along at a very fast pace, and has some intriguing ideas about human rights, the aged, and war. It's not the sort of book that is filled with entendr&eacute;, parallels, complex meanings, and so forth, although it does delve into social issues that seem all too real in a fast-paced and reasonably imagined future, where capitalism hasn't quite completely ruined the world, just that everyone accepts the way things work and have achieved a certain level of civil rights (in other words, it's not \\"Alien\\"-esque i.e. Ridley Scott-style pessimism about the future).<br /><br />There are some parallels here to Haldeman's The Forever War, but only in the sense that it deals with futuristic interstellar warfare. Scalzi doesn't worry too much about relativistic time dilation as does Haldeman, though still present it's not \\"Forever\\", i.e. thousands of years. This is not extremely deep, but perhaps somewhat more like a video game with a well-written plot (admittedly a rarity these days).
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is really good but for $6.99???? Overpriced! But i guess it was worth it. I am going to get PC minecraft when i fix my internet connection.i have about 400 worlds and it gets boring all the time. they need to come out with more blocks in this mode.they also need to add more monsters and animals.i still rate 5 stars because i like this app a lot, and i have a really awesome world
B003H4I4JU|3.0|The point I'm making with my review title is that I felt Speaker for the Dead should have been held in reserve until Ender's Shadow and the other proper sequels had been written. Granted, those were 20+ years later, but the story was just so hard to relate to immediately after reading Ender's Game that my initial reaction was a negative one.<br /><br />This is a solid, grand sci-fi novel that stands entirely on its own without requiring Ender's Game as a lead-in, although the likelihood that someone will read this book first is slim, it likely has happened from time to time. Like I said, I did not enjoy this novel at first, because my expectations were not in line with the author's. I wanted more Ender's Game, more battle school, more stories about the children. Instead, the author sends our hero out into the far reaches of space to a colony planet, never to return to Earth. It's his story, I guess, but I have always considered that to be a very bad decision, as far as developing this beloved character.<br /><br />Secondly, I failed to appreciate this novel because it had religious overtones that I found disturbing. Not just an alien race with a social order/religion, no, what I mean is, Card's religious themes applied to Ender Wiggin, a boy who was raised without religion. In other words, raised without the imprint of fatalism or shame for human behaviors, natural behaviors that religion calls sin or evil. Shame, for instance, is an overwhelming trait of post-war Ender, when no such emotion should exist in a child raised Spartan-style to be a warrior from a young age onward.<br /><br />A child raised in that environment, taught to ignore pain, to defeat an enemy COMPLETELY, so that they can never again threaten you. That is what he did to the alien race that threatened Earth. He was a hero for saving humanity. There was no GUILT or REGRET involved in that action. Furthermore, to exacerbate the flaw in this character, he was not even AWARE that the battle was real, with real lives being lost, and a real alien race wiped out.<br /><br />No, these flaws and inconsistencies are absolutely unrealistic and borne from Card's own religious perspectives, transferred to his character, Ender. I do not pull out that card (forgive the pun) on my own, Card has made his religious perspectives public domain.<br /><br />Therefore, as a result of not understanding or believing the apparent GUILT and REGRET imprinted onto Ender, I had a hard time taking the rest of the story seriously because my suspension of disbelief was lost in the first chapter. The SoD was a greater loss to me than the religious characteristics applied to this beloved hero.<br /><br />In the end, Ender becomes a puppet caricature, wielded by the author, possessing the author's own insecurities, rather than possessing the true confidence of a warrior child --akin to a Spartan. That child would have felt glory after defeating a great threat, doing exactly what he was trained to do. Not guilt. Not regret. Overall, it was just really impossible for me to enjoy it as a result.<br /><br />Back to my premise, about the timing of the story. It may not have won the Hugo and Nebula awards 20 years later, but would have made a lot more sense after the Shadow series had played out, but that too was dependent upon the loss of Ender to space. Irrelevant, but just wishing, perhaps, for a parallel universe scenario in which Ender did not leave.with real lives being lost, and a real alien race wiped out.<br /><br />No, these flaws and inconsistencies are absolutely unrealistic and borne from Card's own religious perspectives, transferred to his character, Ender.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|its an awesome game it's a good influence because it tells kids to not spray paint trains and stuff like that
B0010SKSTO|4.0|I love watching body language and this gave me some important information that I was missing. The best part was reading it on the kindle so I could highlight and mark stuff I wanted to remember and the end I had all my notes in one spot. I appreciated the author's personal stories interspersed with all the knowledge.
034580404X|5.0|I've passed the books on to friends who have read them more then once and bought the series themselves.  I will definitely share the book with more people.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have not read a book that was such a page-turner in years. An incredible story of the best and worst of humanity. Hoping for more!

0805092919|5.0|I got this book for my grandson, they read it to him at daycare and it was his favorite, so I ordered this so he would have his own.  He loves it.  Fast shipping and it was just what I expected.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|We found many of the situations in this film true to life in a quirky kind of way.  A great escape when you don't want something too serious.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Like it and the kids will play it for hours. It runs smoothly and loads fast the game play is challenging while still easy enough for everyone to play.
B00867GK26|5.0|Who doesn't like Nemo? I'm simply giving this a 5 star rating due to the fact that the movie is great and should be watched by everyone.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This is a great game however there's a glitch where it erases my lives after one round of play. which wastes My money.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|One Republic isn't one of those groups that had to grow on me, I instantly fell in love with their music. It seems their music and sound is evolving but for the better. Each album is solid and not muddled with garbage. This junior album is no exception at all, its another solid album by such a fantastic group. From the original cover art to the catchy songs the group has done it again in keeping their sound original and entertaining.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Yep, I'd buy that for a dollar. Best story I've read in a long while. Go Mark Whatney, space pirate
0446547654|5.0|It's easy reading and has a good twist at the end.  Of course, anything by Nicholas Sparks has been good!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome it is way better than temple run screw temple run subway suffers is the best
B007N6NGYG|4.0|I like the game but it can be better<br />Only if you can buy things that could help you win and if it wasn't so hard
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I'm a fan of Craig on tv and I read good reviews on this book so I got it yesterday. Just finished. I read it instead of going to the gym last night, I read it instead of watching the late late show, I read it at my desk at work today, I read while my kids ate dinner this evening. Mr. F turns out is a really good writer and his real life seems like a movie to me. Love this book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun. I would play it all day every day if I could. My friends think it's stupid, but I think it's pretty cool
0761158820|5.0|My son was looking for something other than Legos to build and I found these on Amazon.  What we both liked about them was that they were pre-printed, pre-cut monsters with easy to follow directions and some funny little stories and names for each one.  A hot-glue gun is recommended to put these together.  This would be great for a child who can build independently, or for an adult and child who want to have a fun project to do together.  There are MANY monsters in this book.  Also, there are @10 un-illustrated monsters at the end to color yourself!  Not for little hands, that's for sure, or for many sensitive-to-scary-thing little eyes, for that matter, but the illustrations are not gorey or anything, just think &#34;monster&#34;!  Also, great deal for the price, considering we purchased another paper toy book for a similiar price and there were only five things in it to build.
B00B69UQEO|3.0|I've grown up with Depeche Mode - my mom was a New Wave chick who was in the clubs dancing along with Speak and Spell, while purchasing every DM album afterwards - and I've come to really love their music ever since I bought my first DM LP all on my own way back when (Ultra). So, this album has to impress me if it wants good marks for being a good addition to Depeche Mode's library, rather than it getting good marks just because all the other music acts in stores suck.<br /><br />With that being said, this album is merely okay. I'd hate to fall into the \\"Alan Wilder club,\\" but after he left there was definitely a downward progression of energy within the group. Ultra was a great break away from where SoFaD was taking the band because it was a reaction to Gahan's drug addition, how close DM was to breaking up entirely, and Alan's departure. So, when you compare that mindset to DM's last album, Sounds of the Universe, I gotta dare anyone who's never heard either album to say that they were written by the same people. And while I know that DM has moved away from their sexual innuendo beginnings, they've moved in to a category that I just don't care about - Gahan is more focused with his religious fanaticism and faith than ever, Gore isn't challenging himself and gives us single track minded song writing, and Fletcher's mixes are lazy sounding because the band prefers to let Gahan's voice lead the instrumentals rather than it being the other way around. The lyrics are fine for what they are, but the songs are so far and away from anything \\"Depeche Mode\\" that you gotta wonder if they really have anything to say anymore.<br /><br />There's little energy here. Outside of three tracks (The decent 'Angel', the almost excellent 'Should Be Higher', and the sleeper track 'Soothe My Soul') the album just sounds tired. And honestly, I'm tired. I'm tired of the reflectional music they've been making for a long while now, I'm tired of the slower/methodical tracks that have a deep meaning to the band alone, and I'm tired of not having loved a Depeche Mode album in 16 years. If you want my frame of mind, the tracks I still love and listen to today are 'Lie to Me', 'Nothing', 'Stories of Old', 'Useless', 'Sea of Sin'; and so I'm not looking for another Violator album full of commercial hits. It's just that I've found every album since Ultra has only been able to provide me with one, maybe two tracks, that I really enjoy while the rest are duds.<br /><br />Like I said earlier, this album is okay. But you'll not also be frustrated at all the ballad songs that Gahan needs to sing these days, but also because hidden behind his voice you can hear the original DM sound. It's buried beneath the boring flat noises that Gore and Fletcher use to enhance the singers lyrics, but it's there, and sometimes the best you can get is when it's tailing at the very end 10 seconds of a song on it's very own.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I couldn't find a consistent answer about support for 4 gigs of ram on Synology boxes.  Some people tried and couldn't boot and other people said it worked fine.  I gambled and bought two of these to see what would happen.<br /><br />Works fine.  Boots up and shows 4 gigs total ram.  My box has been running for about a week now but that's also the first thing I did when I got the box so I can't say anything about the performance difference or the long term reliability or anything like that.<br /><br />One note: the stock ram was 1333MHz.  It bothers my inner dork that I've replaced it with 1066.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This was purchased from Bob's Best Offers through Amazon.com.  It has been in use for less than three months.  It broke so I called LifeProof.  Based on the serial numbers, LifeProof was able to determine this is a counterfeit case.  Amazon.com is refunding the purchase price.  LifeProof advised to only buy their cases on Amazon if it states the case is shipped and sold by Amazon.com, not by an outside seller.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read The Secret Garden as a child and my fancy was caught by the sour little Mary and the quiet, magical garden.  Now I read it as an adult and mother with my attention drawn to the suffering Archibald and neglected, scared Colin. It's still the lovely, satisfying book I remember; even more so now for its poignant final chapters.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Not only did this take a long time to d/l (probably at least 20 mins), but then once it is, you don't even get the whole game!!!  Not sure if I will ever d/l a G5 game again<br />because I had another G5 game that also took a long time.  RIDICULOUS!!!!
B00542USJW|5.0|Wow, Michael doing what only he can do in a film of this type. The movie was a hit with adults and children alike.
1558908366|1.0|This item is saying the run time for movie is 119 minutes. It's NOT. It's 124 minutes which means it's not the theatrical version of Pretty Woman. It's got added footage that was not cleaned up well. Very frustrated by this. It seems you can't fine the oringal version of Pretty Woman on DVD (much like Star Wars). Stay away from this one!!!!!

B0091REZMW|3.0|it would be more fun if u could earn more diamonds or buy some with your coins so u can play longer than ten minutes at a time!
B001AW156U|4.0|They are really good for first person shooters and just all around helpful to have to save you from that occasional slip of the shoulder buttons. (PS4 should take a hint and integrate this style) However, note that this was when I bought it for $1.99, not the ridiculous price it is now, $5.99. Would only buy for the low price that I did. If it was 45.99 I would not have bought these. My advice? Wait for the price to go down, then definitely buy it.

B0015AARJI|3.0|So I ordered this, it was dead on arrival (didn't work due to defect at the manufacturer's fault). I got a refund and had to send it back to amazon, but that part was simple. I ordered another controller from amazon, but it's going to take extra days to get here because it could've been avoided if Sony sent me a good controller in the first place. But no, they sent me a defective one so I had to waste an extra 2 days for the replacement to get here. Thanks for wasting everybody's time, Sony.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This is a fantastic second movie in the Sherlock series. It keeps the feel and tone of the first movie. Lighthearted and joking, although it is a bit more violent than the first. I really enjoyed this movie, I have watched ti multiple times, and I think Robert Downey Jr. plays a wonderful Sherlock
