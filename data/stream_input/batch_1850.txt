B003DWC6IQ|5.0|Archer spares no time introducing us to the pivotal event in the first chapter. Thereafter the scene is set for a fast-paced novel of revenge and unadulterated greed with exciting twists that leads to a decisive and gratifying end! Loved it!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book will have you stressing out about the twists and turns.  But one thing that you can't deny is how much you will love Travis!  Loved this book. I cannot wait til  Walking Disaster!
B0090YHSFC|5.0|I saw this as one of the free apps of the day so I thought I would try it out. It is sooo much fun! I play it all the time now. I definetly suggest this app! :)
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I'm a big fan of the &#34; Alien&#34; series of movies and this is a great prequel to them. There is some confusing bits about the movie though, mainly about the chemistry how humans and aliens came into being. Even with that, it is still very entertaining. I hope they come out with a sequel to this movie.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Although, I find the writing repetitive to the point of near redundancy, it works for this novel. A great first-person narrative that engages you in the characters' life and thoughts. Thrilling! A must read.
B003VANOFY|5.0|excellent product , rigth on time and what more can i say muy muy recomendado , se los aseguro vatos neta
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|This album is quite a bit different from her first, but equally amazing!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!!  You won't regret buying it!!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We love this movie and the special message it teaches. The movie is also great. Everyone should have it in their library
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another fantastic book from an amazingly talented author.  This book had it all.  What an intense, deep and emotional story.  Can't wait to read her next one.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I generally like these types of games and have gone back to play this game quite a few times, so I can't really say that I hate it. However, there are a few nagging problems that keep me from really enjoying this game.<br /><br />In the standard mode, the basic premise of the game that each ball/stone you cause to drop (not destroy, just drop) will add to your ammo count. Once you run out of ammo, the game is over. This is a fun little mechanic, but there are some frustrating aspects to it.<br /><br />First, at the end of the round, the game ends before calculating any final combos you might have made. It really should wait for any pieces to fall BEFORE going to the end of round screen, but it doesn't. I swear I would have a lot more ammo in this game if it wasn't for this. Then again, this only happens when you drop a few balls at the very end. If you drop like twenty or so, then it still counts most of them. So, eh.<br /><br />Second, is the algorithm for deciding which color comes next. At the very end of the round, when I only have one or two more colors left, I seem to waste 20 ammo just waiting until I can get the right color to clear the board with. And this isn't me trying to come up with a cool combo, either. It's just that they won't give me the right color to clear the piece attached to the wall. In addition, there are some issues involved with eliminating colors from the map. At the very end when there is only one or two pieces left, I should not be given a color that is not on the board. If the game was going to give me red, but I got rid of all the reds, then that piece should change to a different color. Final issue with the algorithm would be when there is two piece left, one on top of the other, I seem to get the next seven pieces as the top part that I can't do anything with. All I can do is continually make matches of three and just try not clutter the board too much before I can finally get the one color that I need. For the most part, I can't even make cool ending combos because I get seven of one color at a time (and it's not the color that I need, obviously).<br /><br />The second play mode is an arcade type where you have unlimited ammo, but the ceiling gradually moves down until you either run out of room on the play field or clear the screen. The main problem I have with this game mode is that the gameover line is higher up than would normally be expected in such a game. I really think it should be one layer lower, especially since the physics can be sticky sometimes and so you will lose unexpectedly when trying to go for some side shots.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty fun game that could be made great with a few minor adjustments. If you're not bothered by any of these downsides, then it would be worth a buy. Otherwise, I would like them to fix at least one of these issues (any of them would be good) before I recommend it to others.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a GREAT app for listening to stations you are unable to get at your &quot;vacation&quot; location. Then you don't have to listen to boring local radio. There are no good local stations in Northwest Michigan BUT I can listen to Detroit and Windsor on TuneIn.
0547995660|1.0|This book is for children, not for teens or adults. It starts promising but there is just no ending. It goes nowhere. And therefore it was not worth reading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I hate to copy what a lot of reviewers said, but its WAY better than Temple Run! You don't have to constantly move your kindle fire around to avoid obstacles...You just use your fingers! Amazing game! And is worth while.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|This is also a Christmas gift for my grandson. Even though he has yet to open it, he will be very happy!
0375507256|5.0|A thought provoking series of intertwined stories.  Gives one pause to consider the world in which we live, from whence we came and our destiny.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|It is a expetacular box. It is fantastico. Very good for collectors. I recommend to  all lovers of the Beatles
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|Very good graphics...cool story. Kept my attention but can't see paying 5 bucks for a game like this. Would like to finish it tho
B002PMV9K6|5.0|The subject says it all, I got this dvd at a great price, it arrived quickly, and I have no problems with the DVD it was in perfect condition.
B003DPQBQG|5.0|This is a wonderful animation and gives me a chance to practice my Spanish.  There is no entry for this but I have two more to sell.Look for it under the VHS title for Urban Efficiency.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I have this game on my computer so I was quite irritated when I found you couldn't get it for my Transformer Prime or Note 2 from the play store because it wasn't &#34;officially compatible&#34;.  However, I have had no compatibility issues on either of my two Android devices and the game is awesome.<br /><br />My only complaint is it doesn't have all the features the PC version does (Tree of Life/Zen Garden/some missing challenge modes).  If they updated it to include those it'd get the full 5 stars.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This movie had its moments but overall I'm glad I only spent $4 to watch it on Amazon.  The funniest parts were all in the previews.  The flash gordon story line was really stupid and all of the cameos felt forced.  I like dumb comedies, but this one was a little too dumb for my tastes.
B0015AARJI|4.0|I had some reservations about going back to the dual shock, but after using it for awhile I haven' t noticed any difference. The response time seems to be the same and the battery lasts just as long.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The clever Grisham did what Grisham does in The Racketeer.  Pretty soon he will have to write about paralegals or legal secretaries, since he has explored just about every odd situation in which a lawyer can find himself.  So many of his novels are great... it's so nice to have the kindle free trial for when he turns out the odd stinker.
B0017HPHBM|5.0|My son is a Batman freak and this gift set is so awesome. It includes some really cool items and the movie is great.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I enjoyed learning about the various personalities and interactions of the individuals. Lincoln was a greater President and more capable individual than I ever realized!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I bought this because of the author, not realizing it was part of a young adult/teen series. I bought some of the others about Theodore Boone and enjoyed them all.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie.  I like Seth McFarland,and the trailers looked pretty good.  However, I hardly laughed at all, and just didn't think it was funny.  The premise was stupid and it just didn't click with me.
0425252868|5.0|This is a great book, a true World War II story, about two enemy pilots, told by a knowledgeable and talented author, Adam Makos.  My aunt got me this book for Christmas, (thanks, Aunt Jean), but I couldn't wait for Christmas to read it.  And, once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  I loved it, and highly recommend it, and hope that somebody in Hollywood makes this into a movie.  It would be a blockbuster!!! [[ASIN:0425252868 A Higher Call: An Incredible True Story of Combat and Chivalry in the War-Torn Skies of World War II]]
B007T99ENE|4.0|'Sweet Tooth' was more successful than 'Solar' because it was more satisfying that reading a total anti hero in 'Solar'. Again he presents an anti-heroine but sometimes I regret reading about people I don't care for from page 1.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|No more battery drain. Could see right away that recharging works much faster if the Fire is powered completely down first.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Had trouble updating apps. Need more room on SD card. Clean Master did the trick. Phone updates apps again. App did what I had hoped.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome book much much better than the movie! I would recommend this book to anyone that has seen the movie to learn the background of the characters!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|would be better if it didn't keep telling you to upgrade to the full version. other than that I like it.
B00004U45G|5.0|Seems like they had played together for years. Sound was great loved set list and would have loved to have seen show
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Have watched a numer of times with my grandkids ... They loved it, too. This is one dvd that is a keeper for a long time.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|The second to final season of Gossip Girl is a must watch!  Plenty of schemes and drama!  Some very important characters go through some tough and trivial times as well!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This was such a fun movie.  Made me think of my childhood and when I use to go off on adventures with my cousin.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown is a master story teller! His characters are complete to where you feel you know them. This is one of those books that you cannot put down. There is a lot of history of the Masons and of Washington DC in this book. I was so taken by some of the information that I would occasionally stop reading and Wiki it to see if it was factual. Very interesting.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Have watched a numer of times with my grandkids ... They loved it, too. This is one dvd that is a keeper for a long time.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Wasn't quite what I was expecting, but a great movie none the less.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|this was a great movie. i would have watched in theaters, probably better than my HDTV, and been happy to pay for the tickets!
B008M721MS|5.0|I love Skype, now I can have it on the go with my tablet!  I also have Skype on my PC.  I haven't used iy on my Kindle HD yet.

B000I0QL82|3.0|I was so excited to finally find Holiday Inn on DVD and in color!  Unfortunately, the front cover of the box is the only color you will find here.  I just figured since the picture on the front was in color and it was a Special Edition, that they had taken the time to colorize the film as well.  It's a great movie and I am happy to add it to my collection, but my kids were really bummed.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|I am a big Johnny Depp fan, But not his best work. I really hate when you see the previews for a movie, and it gives away all the good parts. this was the case here. in fact the story line was slow and at times tiring, dosed off the first time i watched it!
B009ESIGHI|5.0|Dear Disney,<br /><br />Thank you, Disney, for the care you take in presenting your classic films in their intended original aspect ratio on Blu-ray. I would like to help you make future releases even better.<br /><br />There is a Blu-ray mastering technology called \\"seamless branching\\" wherein it is possible for the end-user to select from multiple versions of a film that which they wish to see. An example of this technology is used the the BD release of Spielberg's [[ASIN:B000VECACG Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]]] which presents three versions on one disc.<br /><br />Using seamless branching, you could offer your customers the version of \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\" they wish to view:<br /><br />  1. The one you want them to see.<br /><br />  2. The one they want to see -- this latter includes the song \\"When Love Is Gone\\" -- which, arguably, touches upon, *is* the heart of this film and is evoked in the closing song -- \\"When Love Is Found\\" -- and revisited in the closing credits which makes its absence all the more keenly missed.<br /><br />  3. The one but few know incorporating now deleted scenes. (Perhaps including the other songs dropped out of the film but included in the soundtrack: \\"Room In Your Heart\\" and \\"Chairman of the Board\\" -- these may/may not have been filmed).<br /><br />This would bring tidings of comfort and joy to your global home viewing audience. And it would also boost sales when you re-release the Blu-ray in, for example, a special Digi-book format! Special features *could* include a separate DTS 5.1 soundtrack for the film score and songs! I love the sheer idea of it!<br /><br />Best Wishes & Happy Holidays!

B007THA4FI|3.0|I could not get all the way thru it. Too boring. Moved on to another e-book. The life of Abraham Lincoln.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie is a great date night movie. Mark Wahlberg is great in it and as always Seth is hilarious. Its got the sweet &#34;see you should do that&#34; moments that girls love in romantic comedy, but the raw &#34;that's some funny ....&#34; that guys like. Watch it!
B008RXYOKY|3.0|Buy this only if you really really need to.  If you have a few firewire drives, then you really have no choices with the newer macs, they only came with a thunderbolt connector.  I will not increase your FW drive's native speed to thunderbolt's amazing 10 Gbps.  I think FW only runs at 400-800 Mbps range This adapter will work nicely until you switch all your peripherals to thunderbolt, I guess.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|For the type of movie that it is, I think it is great.  I grew up reading these comic books.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This was suppose to be a christmas present, but my five year old got to open it early!  This game is fun for the whole family and lots of fun!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story was very confusing, but I was able to follow it for the most part. Many of my assumptions at the beginning were confounded by the end of the book so it gave me a good ride for the money. My only quibble was with the ending--kind of wimpy given the rest of the book.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Not the most stylish but the sound is superb.  This is a baby boomer's headphone.  If you are not into the hip hop style head sets nor earbuds, and you don't want to spend crazy money on a Bose headset, this is for you.  This is the second set I bought in 10 years, and they really lasts.
B008M87GJK|4.0|this app works very well, looks great, and doesn't crash.  It is fun to get the UK perspective on the world.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is very addicting.There really isn't much more to it than that. Flick, Flick, and then Flick again. Why is there minimum word count for reviews. I've said everything I need to in five.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|Moran is scathingly funny in her explorations of what it means to be a woman today. The only quibble I had was the emphasis on Lady Gaga's subversiveness, but that could be just because I don't care for her.
030758836X|5.0|The audio version is read by two actors.  One for Amy and One for Nick.  Very refreshing.  The story is fun but not as twisted and convoluted as I hoped it to be.  Still, it is very enjoyable and a quick read / listening.
B0051T46XM|3.0|My family enjoyed this movie, but that was probably because we are mainly scandinavians(Norway / Swedish) and I have been read my kids stories about trolls for years.  People from the southern counties might think this is a bit dorky.
0345457684|4.0|Great world, interesting new concepts which are well fleshed out. I found the plot fairly convoluted. At one point I found it hard to symphazize with the hero - when he goes on a rampage killing any and all employees at the clinic. I liked the writing.
B0064W652A|5.0|Hush. At first it seemed maybe too simple of an anti hero. A masked  man using all of batmans arch nemesis against him, without even having a back story himself, seemed kind of hard to believe. How could a man with no criminal history show up in criminal kingpin heaven and get guys like the joker to be a part of his game? Well he did and did it flawlessly. There's something every human needs or wants and hush found it in the darkest of hearts and minds. Hush may not have a roll in any movies or have a spot on your batman t-shirt, but he has a place in Gotham city lore.
B004U52VPS|5.0|A very nice addition to  my collection. One of my absolute favorite purchases. Would gladly suggest this to a friend.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved everything about this book ... the writing style, the plot, two different voices. Had all intentions of giving five stars and couldn't wait to finish it so I could review it until I got to the end.... What the heck?  What an anti-climatic, idiotic ending!  I kept thinking the husband was going to outsmart his wife like a mental chess game but it fizzled to a great disappointment. Nevertheless I enjoyed reading this book.  Very entertaining but don't expect an &#34;amazing&#34; ending.
B007HACDLK|2.0|I LIKED ALL VINCE FLYNNS BOOKS.EXCEPT THIS ONE.  IN THIS BOOK MITCH RAPP SEEMED NO BETTER THAN THE ENEMY AGENTS HE WAS TRACKING DOWN. HE SEEMED TO ONLY WANT TO BEAT OR KILL. THERE WAS HARDLY A DECENT WORD THAT CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH. HE LOST HIS HUMANESS.
B009JBZH54|1.0|Why am I being charged $52.99 when it is selling now for $35.96...it did not ship until TODAY so I should get charged the new price...
B004YM6JI2|5.0|A very nice addition to  my collection. One of my absolute favorite purchases. Would gladly suggest this to a friend.
0156421178|5.0|I recently assisted this to my high school history class during our unit on the Spanish Civil War. It provided a wonderful avenue for discussion as a book club in class. My students read it over a 3 week period and found it very accessible and informative. Orwell does a wonderful job of explaining his first hand account of the war as well as providing a historical perspective of secondary event, such as the political situation and international intervention that he was not aware of at the time. Overall it helped to make the Spanish Civil War meaningful and engaging to the majority of my students and helped to clarify and illuminate many of the key standards that I was hoping to address.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|There were simply no flaws in the casting, directing, or acting.  This was one of the all around best movies ever!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|A great story with a happy ending just as it should be. Your family should own it too! ! !
1451695195|5.0|I've recommended this book on my Facebook page and I'm givimg copies as Christmas presents.  The story is credible because the author has the training and knowledge to analyse what happened to him.  I was surprised by the description of the Earthworm's Eye View.  I don't think that is an element of any NDE I've read about.  This book changed my outlook on the end of life experience and strengthened my faith in the hereafter.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Some people say they can't understand a negative review of THIS product!  Well, I have to say, I can.  Just turn on the radio today and tell me...what the crap is that the youth of today have to listen to?  Most of them, if they have ANY taste in music at all...are turning to the \\"oldies\\" stations and listening to the music of the past...from the 50's to the 80's!  MUSIC JUST LIKE THIS...JETHRO TULL!  Why can't they write anything ORIGINAL for the commercials of today?  I suppose that's why they call it \\"rap\\", because it rhymes with \\"crap!\\"  The so-called noise of today (I would not DARE call it music...Beethoven and Mozart would haunt me FOREVER!) is living evidence of the so-called artists of today's \\"waste of money\\" for lessons (if they ever had any!) and instruments!  I wonder if they ever heard the maxim...\\"Silence is Golden\\"?  Dead air would be BETTER than the garbage pile they are heaping on the ears of the youth of today!  Like the old fella said in the movie It's A Wonderful Life...\\"Youth is wasted on the young!\\"  Maybe the so-called 'artists' of today could actually spend some of the money they are ripping off from the youth of today and TAKE SOME MUSIC LESSONS!  (And, maybe even buy some descent clothes for them to \\"perform\\" in???  Just a suggestion!)<br />I will finish with this...<br />Ian Anderson, and MANY of the artists of yesterday will OUTLAST the music of the talentless 21st Century!  They at least have a foothold on the avenue of lasting music, much like Classical Music.  It's been around for CENTURIES!  And, Ian Anderson will outlast ANYTHING in music of today!
B0002BO05S|5.0|This is the best movie made regarding the life and times of Jesus Christ.  I saw it when it came out in the movie houses not once but twice.<br />.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have used a ton of other keyboards and this keyboard replacement finally makes me like my Galaxy S3.  I absolutely cannot type on the stock Android keyboard, and the Samsung keyboard is not much better. I used Swype until I finally found this one and it is the winner overall by a huge margin.  I had so many typos on the other keyboards that I was actually hating to use the phone for texting and surfing and anything that required me to type.  I felt like an idiot (I may well be, but surely I can type on a phone?!) until I got this app.  I've been using it for a year now, best app purchase I've made on the Android platform by far.<br /><br />In short, you can read a ton of reviews but just go try the free version and see what you think.  I think it is the best option out there for Android.  I like the stock keyboard on my Windows Phone devices best of all, but when I have to use Android this is the easy winner for me!
B0034G4P1W|5.0|I think I personally would give this 3 or 4 stars - I like it, but don't love it - but the kids think it's wonderful and we got it for them, so hence the 5 stars! &#34;Fire those long things that go boom!&#34;
B009KS4XRO|1.0|If I could figure out how to delete or uninstall it I would...  a  total waste of space  glad it was free
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I downloaded this on my Kindle.  It was so easy and convenient to do.  The most exciting part was that it was free... Thanks Amazon I will definitely enjoy revisting this classic!
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Funny movie, and super witty.  There are a few scenes that I find inappropriate for kids that age, and can't imagine that parents would allow their children to do that for a movie.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I watched season 1 and I like season 2 almost as much...so far. I can 't wait until Jan for next episode.<br />Signed Addicted

B003XCVQ3C|5.0|it is very good items and i use it in anytime and always need to plug it to my computer
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I have been watching this movie every year, for 12 years now. Each year, it makes me laugh and puts me in the spirit of Christmas. I also watch it just to hear Ray Charles &#34;That Spirit of Christmas&#34; song. The best!
B00A2BTCM4|5.0|2112 is a cornerstone for any Rush fan, one of their top albums.  A mind-blowing title track with five wide-ranging awesome singles completing the album.  The surround sound is just right.  Not too obnoxious with the mix which allows you to pick-out sounds and instruments that you may not have heard before.<br />I sat down to hear just 2112 and didn't move until the end of \\"Something for nothing\\".  I have the Moving Pictures surround mix as well and I must say that I enjoyed listening to 2112 more.  The video that accompanies the music is entertaining to watch as well.  Listening to every song on the disc, I discovered something new.<br />\\"Don't annoy us further, We have our work to do\\" and buy this!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|was very exciting and didn't waste time with rhetoric, also had some humor. Ties in well with the previous movie
B005HSL626|5.0|My daughter loves playing this, it keeps her entertained! It is interesting to watch her play and figure out what to slice and what not to slice!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Absolutely my favorite program and can hardly wait for the 3rd season to start.  Recommend it to EVERYONE to enjoy
B007XHWROK|4.0|My daughter will love this. It is in perfect condition, brand new. Product is well sealed and cannot wait to see my daughter open this!
B009EANE3M|5.0|#3 is a great album. I was thinking ok how are they going to top Science & Faith because it was an amazing album but they did. Good Ol' Days is my favorite song and they are great live!!!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A must for every dysfunctional family.  I must have seen this movie 20 times.  Since getting rid of my VCR, needed a cd.  Love it!
B008QMMEOE|4.0|Could offer more variety in puzzles and activities to do between puzzles. (beyond popping balloons) Good little game though !

B000SEIK2S|5.0|great premise action packed, very true to the reasons we fight. the best of the series in the line. as good as starship troopers
B005UA0FLE|5.0|Beautiful voice, beautiful music--a winner. Michael Buble's version of Christmas favorites is so enjoyable it makes me want to keep playing it even after the holidays!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I thought this was going to be an ok movie but it is a great movie. Has such a good story line and the acting was excellent. Would reccomend this to all.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Great service!! Had my new phone in 2 days. Paperwork was all in order and encountered no problems. way to go!!
B0024FAG5I|2.0|I went to movies once this film came out so many years ago. I've use to chase Gene Hackman's films, on that moment nor Crowe even less Dicaprio were reconognized actors. Once I saw the Blu Ray's movie version I thought \\"What an awesome casting for this movie!\\", so I get it. I am still thinking it is a some great performances on the movie, but I think it has a really bad director. I have to say that this movie's director could not took advantage of a great casting. What a pitty!
B00A62UR96|5.0|i love this book so much. it is about a kid who tries to keep the train from going to the north pole but he did it for his friends.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Sandra Bullock was so good in this movie. It is such a heartwarming story. The acting was fantastic and it will keep you watching. great film. would reccomend this to all
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This entire comic series is great. The author puts you in situations where zombies aren't the biggest fear but society is. It makes you re-evaluate your thoughts in a zombie apocalypse.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|Excellent.  Great looking 'print'.  And Great extras.  It came very promptly!!  It truly is a great movie with a great script and excellent performances.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Great show! Plenty of action, an opportunity to suspend disbelief. The actors do a credible job of introducing you to an alternative perception.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Meryl Streep was so good in this as Julia. She is such a good actress and she nailed Julia Childs. What an actress and what a great movie.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I have always really enjoyed the works of Preston and Child and Two Graves was no exception.  I really enjoyed this book, however it wasn't my favorite.  I can't quite put my finger on why, I think it just doesn't feel like the previous Pendergast books.  Either way I still suggest reading it.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Seiko gets a 5-Star because this is a handsome & rugged watch at a great value. I like the canvas strap with the matching dial color. Plus a reliable Japanese movement!
B00A7CI82I|4.0|In my opinion, no one can replace Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, so I'm glad this wasn't just a reboot.  The story is a bit derivative (like an onion, peeling away the layer of one training program reveals another underneath, one with supposedly better and more &#34;stable&#34; agents.  How many layers will there be in the end, I wonder?) but it detracts only slightly from the action.  Jeremy Renner is in his element as an action hero, and Rachel Weisz is wonderful as the brainy, brave and vulnerable leading lady, as usual.  A complaint I might have had if I didn't know there will be a sequel is that I thought the story ended with too many loose ends.  Another complaint is that we didn't get to see the trademark hand-to-hand combat at the end with the other &#34;super&#34; agent. Can't there be a spectacular car chase AND a brutal fight with an opponent with skills that challenge his?
B001EX81ZI|5.0|These caps are always what I lose first when for the bottles.  This 6 pack was much cheaper through this vendor than at walmart or babies r us.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Most Lego products of this price come in large boxes, this box is not much bigger than a softball. NOT worth the money!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Killing Floor is Lee Child's popular first novel. Unfortunately, I never felt immersed in the storyline. The characters and the strange absence of dialogue created a distance that was left unresolved. It seemed that the author enjoys describing the setting far more than creating real dialogue. At times, it's abundantly clear that Lee Child is not from the United States (i.e., Reacher - the main character and military veteran - refers to America as, \\"the States\\").<br /><br />His word choice and descriptions are abysmal and confusing at times:<br />-\\"It was about as distinctive as the most distinctive thing you could ever think of.\\"<br />-His female lead, Roscoe, is supposed to be a southern gal with a small-town demeanor. But, that doesn't fit her word choice of describing people as \\"dour\\" and \\"lugubrious.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes, the novel is brazenly predictable. In the end, it is still suspenseful.
1589949811|5.0|Picked this for the hubby person, he loves Magic the Gathering, I love Lord of the Rings, so I figured this would be a great compromise between them.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Not my favorite Tim burton movie. I normally love the Tim burton/ Johnny depp movies but this movie was a little to werid for me to get into.
1449410243|1.0|We love our cats even though they often get that 'kill you and eat you look'.  Purchased this book thinking it would be good for a laugh but it's disgusting low humor.  Don't bother...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book....loved the twist and turns. Can't wait to start reading Mockinjay.  Thanks Stephanie Collins for another adventure!
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|great game easy to follow, to short wish more like this.  Enjoy playing the game highly recommend it.  Happy playing
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I like this app it's really cool I always download the app when ever I get a new smart phone
B0041OT9W6|5.0|READ THIS MANY YEARS AGO... WANTED TO READ AGAIN.. AND AM SO GLAD I DID, MEANS MORE THE SECOND TIME.. HIGHLY RECOMEND.
B00ANR2H4M|2.0|Nazis, aliens, demons, serial killers......and NUNS! Aaaaaahhh!<br /><br />They even ripped off Texas Chainsaw Massacre but called him \\"bloody face\\". Maybe Rob Zombie, the king of unoriginality is a writer for the show.<br /><br />Lange is amazing and my stars are for her but I like the demon nun actress as well. Otherwise, the show is absolutely ridiculous but even worse than that. It's an insult. A weave of predictable and boring socio-political commentary disguised as characters and storyline with the \\"hey, wouldn't it be cool to put this in there!\\" mentality produced a pile of what looks like was dumped out of America's garbage can. Nazis and the patriarch church torturing sexually independent women and lesbians with some blood spatter = Asylum = yawn. But don't forgot about the aliens.<br /><br />It's so SHOCKING to see the priest crucified and the statue of Mary defiled.......wait, no it's not. It was so edgy to show Santa as a murderer.....well, not really.<br /><br />The only interesting thing is how arbitrary \\"crazy\\" can be depending on the culture and/or who is \\"in charge\\" determines it, which is scary, but I can just ponder that on my own without subjecting myself to this mind-garbage of a TV show.
B001QB9H10|5.0|Purchased for a male friend who was really happy to get this item and could not believe I had found it so quickly.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was very funny. Rebel Wilson is funny and I love everything that she is in.i like all the songs they picked they really mess good together
B003HE2B9E|5.0|Orianthi is hot! Not just her looks but her guitar playing. Steve Vai says she is very talented. He does a duet with her on track 10 of this album. Grap it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was sorry whem i finished the 3 books. She writes very well indeed. I hope  her other books are just as good.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Was a refreshing look at marriage and the love that returns once eyes open. I laughed throughout this whole movie.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|It was a cute funny. I would probably watch it again in a few months. probably not recommend it though.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|So disappointed with the Facebook app for my new Kindle Fire 8.9.  You get to view about 1/4 of your postings and then the rest are grayed out.  Can't expand them, no way to view.  Apparently this problem has been going on for a couple months now.  Not what I expected for this product.  Hopefully it gets fixed. Soon!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The story is truly one you won't expect or forget. I got so lost in this book, I finished it in a day simply because I just couldn't stop reading it. You will not be disappointed.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|This was a cute movie. About what I expected. Enjoyable for an easy romantic comedy. It had some well written twists and turns that kept it interesting.
B007L6VR12|4.0|The story was quite unusual.  I was surprised at how the relationship developed and that they actually got married like an adult.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|The review by lovesbooks says it all. Even though the prequel novella is engaging and unusual, this book surpasses it in complexity and intensity. This is by far the best book Milan has written and one of the best historical romances of 2012.
B000ZELISO|4.0|...but most movies aren't. This was, however, a very entertaining movie! It's interesting to see the characters getting older. This movie is quite a bit darker than the previous Harry Potter movies, and fight against Voldemort *gasp* has become more urgent and more real. All in all, this was a well done movie and a good addition to the Harry Potter series.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I loved the cast of this movie.  I loved that it was set in the 60's which were so confusing!  I grew up on the water and when scouts were an important part of growing up.  It was delightful.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I like lucy liu the actress and also iike tinker bell the character.  I was curious about the wings and never thought too much about their wings so i bought the dvd to find out about it and enjoyed the plot
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I can't put this series down. And I wish I didn't have anything more to do as I want to read it all the time. The characters are very interesting as you go from one character to another. Wonderful.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|First, be aware that this is only Part 1 of 2 movies that cover the book of the same name. The movie is really well done and highly entertaining. If you liked the book, you'll love the movie.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Picture looks fantastic on Blu-ray. The transfer is in widescreen. Every western movie lover should have this in their collection.
B000NVIXFK|1.0|These guys are rush, they do what they want. They've always done what they wanted. They had to have signed off on how bad this thing sounds. From the outset it is a barrage of sound that hides anything that could be signature for these guys. You have to strain to hear Alex's solo's...what??? Your Alex lifeson.. a guitar legend!!!  Turn up your solo bud!!! Geddy has no precision to his sound. Its blended so well you can't hear any one element.. The same guy wrote the bass lines to red barchetta...ugh...Neils kick is somewhere in the mix but again blended to well who knows. No matter where I tweak this I can't get it to pump without something else sounding like crap. I listen to vinyl run through parametric eq then graphic then through sennheiser headphones. I can put the first rush album on (1974) and with a few tweaks I can make it sound MUCH, much better.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Stupid @#*%ing movie!!! waste of time, do yourself a favor don't watch it!!! Would've gave no stars if i could.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|This was an excellent album to hear after all this time. A true, GOLDEN OLDIE!<br />Brings back wonderful memories!  C-o-o-o-l!!
B003SI9WYG|5.0|I was worried that my 4 year old would think this was spooky but she didn't, she loves Jack and watches this as often as any princess movie.  Recommended for most ages, for most times of year even :)
B008DM4OTA|5.0|my granddaughter loves this game, plays it every time she comes over, even though there are new ones, she always chooses this one
B009YG2ND8|5.0|been a fan of the ff series since the 1st one came out on the nes. game was a little steep in price, but its worth it!
B0016CTX68|5.0|The endGreat album great songs classic Stones?When Mick's voice was solid. MUST HAVE ALBUM.<br />Yahoo day Yahoo day Yahoo dah the end
B009VB97EY|3.0|It was ok, not the best movie, but really, everyone knows the purpose of the movie and its obvioiusly not the plot.  This is exactly what everyone calls &#34;mommy porn&#34; and to be honest, other than Magic Mike meeting a girl, I could not even tell you what the movie was about, but I did like his dancing.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I use it for music and videos and u can download anything on youtube its a great app and u can even get your favorite music for free
B005M5OSBK|5.0|LOVESIT! PINK MARTINI IS SUCH A GREAT BAND AND HAVE THEIR VERY BEST ON THIS DOUBLE DISC ALBUM. CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Although the story lines are new, the actors keep this series fresh and addictive. Sherlock is a recovering heroin addict with a hooded past. Watson is a former (female) surgeon who accompanies Sherlock everywhere he goes to protect him from lapsing into drug abuse. Great chemistry between the actors.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|We did the 48 hour Amazon rental, but it was on the whole time!!!! We will need to purchase, this is such a sweet movie and not to give spoilers but it is such a cute family movie that is girly without being too girly.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|It was easy to load the files/pics and being able to access from other devices, so convenient!  easy to set up and use.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|PUTS YOU IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE, AMBIANCE, AND YOUR VERY OWN SOUNDTRACK TO YOUR LIFE. TWO WORDS, I DRIVE.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This final book in the trilogy brought it to a great close.  I enjoyed the character development and writing style.  It left me wishing for more stories in the world of Panem.
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|Nice app it does just about what it says it'll do. And its not that hard to figure out.. check it out
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|I was looking around for something similar to Glen Cook's Black Company series.<br /><br />I saw the Malazan series recommended on a few different sites, so I gave it a try.<br /><br />Epic is an understatement. While the first three books of the Black Company were good, the rest of the series was good, but not great.<br /><br />I'm now on book eight of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, and I can safely say, the story only gets better.<br /><br />I'm powering my way through the entire series, I haven't read much else since I started these books. They are long, but they pay off.<br /><br />Erikson uses the same recipe in most of the books. Set up a series of almost seemingly unrelated stories and characters. Then through the story slowly bring them closer and closer until they all meet in an epic ending.<br /><br />One of the major themes is confluence. How the use of power draws other powerful entities.<br /><br />Every book has a satisfying conclusion. Yet, characters may drop out for a book or two only to reappear later in unexpected places.<br /><br />All in all, better than the Black Company series. Be warned though, you may get confused but all the characters coming and going.<br /><br />I found it helpful to lookup the occasional reference on the various malazan wikis. Most of the time, spoilers are clearly labeled, so you can get some basic character info without ruining any surprises.
B00011KHTM|4.0|Nothing to complain.    The price is as high as other apple product.    But did what it suppose to do.    However, be alert if you are running Lion or Mountain Lion OS X. The full screen app will look like s*** on multi screen.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Not a bad little game for the price. Don't expect to go to battle; this is a flight simulator for your phone or handheld device.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Good fast read that kept me interested.  Not that it is very realistic, but romance book never really are very realistic.
B0050PYNOY|5.0|Just kidding! Just a funny movie! A silly film starring some great actors and I need six more words to finish this
B004G600A4|4.0|I loved the horse!  It is a pretty retelling of the Repunzal Tale.  I would recommend it to any child.
B009SQQRH2|3.0|Imaginative but kind of difficult to explain multiple Santa's (or a succession of Santa's) to my daughter and not really an adult movie. Plus the character's accents made understanding them difficult (for my &#34;American&#34; ears, anyway)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read almost all of John Grisham books and he has never disappointed me.  I am his biggest fan.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Out of all of the Mitch Rapp books this one is the best one I have read. I highly recomend this book
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The writing and acting is excellect and it gives us a taste of what the English aristocracy was like in the early part of the 20th Century.  The downstairs staff is also given equal time.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes English dramas.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|what can I say? This set is absolutely awesome! My son is going to go absolutely nuts about this set!
B003VS0CWY|5.0|Great product and a great price to purchase from!  Would purchase of them again and they were fast to ship!!!!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It was okay, but not as great as all the hype of course but...what is today with all the companies that lie about just everything. It was good, but not great. Too many flaws in the story I guess is part of it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I see why 10 million people are watching this show! This is one of the best shows on TV. Period!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I found the plot very engaging and witty at the same time. I definitely recommend a read!! Congrats to the author.
B003629IPW|5.0|Great product and a great price to purchase from!  Would purchase of them again and they were fast to ship!!!!
0316228532|4.0|On the surface the small town of Pagford seems to be the quintessential English village with its charming market square, cobbled streets, and centuries-old abbey. But when council member Barry Fairbrother, well-liked and respected, dies of a stroke in his early forties, the town is left in shock. It's also left with a plethora of candidates ready to fill his vacant seat, and that's when the fun, or the trouble, begins. Because the inhabitants of this little town, so warm and friendly to all appearances, have deep-seated resentments and agendas--rich hate poor, teenagers defy their parents, husbands and wives disagree violently, and teachers despair of ever teaching their students anything! This ia a black comedy, well-written and amusing, and if you admire J. K. Rowling of Harry Potter fame, you'll probably like this book, her first adult novel. But there are ao many plot lines and such an abundance of characters this reader, for one, had trouble keeping it all straight.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love it I read it in like 49 mins though so this Is a very small book but it does not .look like it if you like. Lots of Dunn uhh stuff this is you kind . Of book
0547884591|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this book to someone interested in meta-learning. I love the 4HWW and the 4HB, I knew exactly what I was getting and you really got the benefit from all of Tim's testing and experience in both business and fitness. I was hesitant to purchase the 4 Hour Chef because, although I like cooking, it didn't really warrant buying a huge book of recipes.<br /><br />Tim said himself, this book isn't really about cooking, it's about learning to learn. That being said, probably only about 10% of the books content fully addresses this. The rest is pretty much about food or random, boring information (gun facts). I actually really like Tim Ferriss and I will continue to take an interest in his future work, but this is a bit of a let down. Some mention that it's the best book yet, not by a long way.<br /><br />What I would like<br /><br />- Greater detail about how to go about learning complex skills<br />- Tim claims that this is cooking made easy, designed to ease beginners into the process before getting to overwhelmed. And  yet, the very first recipe demands the use of a \\"raw or finished cast iron dutch oven\\". I don't know what that is, doesn't sound like a normal oven to me, and if it is, TELL ME. I'M A BEGINNER!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I have tried multiple times to download angry birds star wars on my kindle fire with no success. I've heard it a great game but after paying for it, I would like to fond this out for myself.
B009ZE27US|1.0|ok terrible app. i'm 8 now I'm 75. really???????????????? DON'T GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My sister tried and she is 1 it said she was 84!!!!!  OK LISTEN TO ME. DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my children love this game since the day I bought this game they were always playing it and when I tried it it was really addictive .
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I think this is one of Grisham's best.  And I've read them all.  The &#34;aha&#34; moment when the plot pieces come together stunning.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I had thought that Ted would be imaginary, but instead in the movie Ted is actually alive (everyone sees that he's alive), so it's a little twist. Very enjoyable & funny...
B005SZNZAY|5.0|Cornell has a phenomenal voice that you can't quite get a handle on with electric music. Here, it's stripped down to it's bare elements and it sounds grand.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This was a real page turner, couldn't put it down once I started.  Gives me incentive to spend the time necessary to master a skill.
140053271X|5.0|My wife loves her Nook. It has her back to reading. She downloads books from the library with ease. She especially likes the fact it brings her back to the same spot she stopped.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|all sounds are tight and and on point!! way better then mercy and ti vs tip. great gift for xmas
B009E3EYS8|4.0|Love this set, and the boys are in fine form. But I can't give it five stars because it took five years to get it out. If you dig Led Zeppelin, you'll be all over this.
B004N66XYE|5.0|Watched the original Upstairs Downstairs, and had to buy the carry on series, If you like the original, you should look at these
0425263916|5.0|Very good book a must read!! The squence of books is great a must read if you read Fifty Shades of Grey.
1440503257|5.0|Good fun for Harry Potter fans. My grandsons will enjoy it, as they are avid Harry Potter fans. Recipes look like they will be easy to follow, even for 9 year olds.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|I stuck with this book to see how it ended. From  the first part, I found errors. She describes Maggie's eyes as green, then shortly thereafter says they are blue. I did not care for the ending, Laurent did not deserve Maggie. Also her parents should have been told the truth and been given the decision to raise the \\"substituted\\" Nicole as their grandchild or not; more lies which could make for a sequel. Not sure I will try this author again.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I lent my copy to some friends, and they've been playing it every couple of days ever since.  I'm glad I played it before I lent it.<br /><br />It's a great story examining family rolls and expectations.  It has a strong lead character and an engaging cast of supporting characters.  While it stresses development over action, the action is great and there's lots of it.<br /><br />It also demonstrates the importance of actually listening and not just hearing... and charades... in parent-child communications.<br /><br />If you're thinking of a DVD for cold nights and cozy couches for the whole family, I'd get this one.  You're going to wear it out.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Fun movie, and this package includes Blu-Ray, DVD, and also an iTunes digital license. Great value for the cost. Especially if you may not always have access to a Blu-Ray player.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Decent action movie, weak plot, not near as good as the first! The cast was good, but just needed a stronger, clearer story line.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Great read! Lots of suspense and easy to follow! well written book i highly recommend to readers! i dont have a lot of time to read but it is easy to pick up after a few days and jump right back in.
B008FPZQQU|5.0|I've been waiting for 20 years for a great remastering of this CD. This one is not Hyped or modernized in any way. It just sounds like the amazing record that it is.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book ever <3 ^_^ Hmm a little to mature for me but I really liked it ^^ I can also relate since I'm a wallflower... o.o
B004VMUS9G|5.0|allows me to wake up to any artist I want and gradually increases volume so I'm not woken up scared. I love this app and the best part is that its free!
B00007KWHG|5.0|Indeed, this CD does provide all ot the best hits of the Four Seasons.  Music you can sing and dance to,  or fun for just listening.  A good collection to familiarize one with the Jersey Boys story.  A must for any collector.
B009PHRIKE|5.0|I've waited 20 years for a decent remaster of Cosmic Messenger and this one is really good. One of the under rated fusion recordings of the mid-seventies.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|my daughter follows the series but didnt have the first season. she was happy to get the history on the families. if you are a late follower get this!!
B007EDYN36|5.0|Best KISS bio of them all!!!!! Love it and have read and enjoyed gene & aces books too, but the honesty in this book without too much trash talk did it fit me. As always drummers and new yorkers do it better..
B00735HGQ6|2.0|I had heard a lot about this book so had high hopes for enjoying it. I felt like the middle got bogged down with the &#34;piped piper&#34; theme and was glad when all the people left him to his journey. I was as tired as Harold at the end of the book!!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love everything about this series. I like being able to purchase it by episode on here because of its convenience.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|C'mon you guys! Three stars?  This may not be Buddy's best,however...can you name another 76 year-old (or 36 or 26 year-old for that matter) who can play and sing with the ferocity of Buddy? This is Buddy in his element, raw and real.  This is no all-star band, just some damn fine players backing up Buddy.  The studio stuff is equally enjoyable.  Buddy is one of the last of his generation and just the fact that he can still perform and make records like this is a testament to his greatness.  Admittedly, I'm biased.  I am a stone Buddy Guy fanatic.  I've been seeing him for 40 years now, in clubs and concert halls, and he never disappoints.  Hell, I'd probably buy a CD of him breathing heavy.  I proudly give this disc 5 stars.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was wonderful, full of strong characters and a compelling plot.  I couldn't put it down, and, months later, I still think about it!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Coupled with the movie.  This was a great background book and it was well written.  Will need to see the movie again to catch all the details that Goodwin showed
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly, and was sad it had to end it was so much fun. Numerous plot twists and a darkly fun portrait of a marriage gone south.
B0026772N8|5.0|This book was so inspiring to me when I first read it 20 years ago that I named my handyman business after it (&#34;Quality Home Care & Repair&#34;).  Pirsig's philosophy of Quality is the main reason I like the book but it is also a good read in that the philosophy is intertwined with a plot of the author's adventures driving across the country with his son and friends.  Don't be turned off by the title if you are not interested in Eastern religions.  It really doesn't directly push any existing religion. It is a new philosophy, and one that will appeal to anyone who cares about doing things well.  It may even convince some people to start doing things well.
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|Enjoyed this book much better than I expected. It was hard to put down and easy to read and hard to predict what would happen next.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I would reccommend this movie to my friends and family.  Love Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Steep together.  Need more like this
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show, It sucked me right in from the first episode, I never thought a zombie program could be so thought out, and the actors are even good!
B00932AA5G|5.0|This movie is very well done. It keeps you engaged throughout the entire story. If you enjoy thriller films with a bit of intrigue, then you'll like this movie.
B0042MEQVG|4.0|I bought this DVD a while ago, and don't remember if it was for myself or for a gift for someone else.  But I never buy online if it's cheaper in the store, so I can deduce that it was a good price when I bought it; and I know it worked correctly.  I think I got it fairly quickly, too.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Loved Jeremy Renner in this show.  The part was made for him. Loved him in The Hurt Locker and look forward to seeing him in many more movies to come.
B002689ATQ|5.0|Great movie! All the right ingredients of a great movie- good plot, good acting, great direction and oh so English!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This movie is very good family movie.  My grandchildren and I watched it severl times the day it arrived. I would recommed this movie for anyones family movie night.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|One of the most impressively designed and beautifully engineered timepieces I have ever owned, this watch sets a standard that is unequalled. Simply terrific!
B0058YPG2K|5.0|It's so complex and intense!!!  I'm addicted!  The idea of a, brilliant, mild mannered, insecure, fumbling, school teacher becoming a deadly meth cook seems far fetched.  However, they make it believable!  You still know he is that school teacher and his insecurities prevail, but he manages &#34;to do what needs to be done!&#34;  Great cast of characters!
0066620996|5.0|All I can say is, &#34;Become a Level 5 Leader!&#34; You'll be glad you did!<br />Very good insight into what it takes to progress toward becoming a great leader at a great company!
B005MLP91C|5.0|I purchased the movie to show to my middle school agriscience students because we are studying about plants.  They really seemed to enjoy it!  They were engaged and entertained.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I felt that it showed a completely different side of this multi-faceted writer. I normally wouldn't choose a novel that is marketed the way this one was; I tend to lean toward more cheerful fare. However, since I am a huge HP fan, I was quite curious to see where Ms Rowling would go with this new book.<br />I wasn't sure how I felt in the beginning, but the characters grew on me and I got sucked into the story pretty quickly. I will say that there are a multitude of characters introduced in rapid-fire succession, so it takes a minute to get everyone straight, but they are all integral to the plot line, and warrant the early entry.<br />I don't want any spoilers, so I will just give my observations of the characters. They are certainly \\"real\\" people, flawed and not particularly likeable. Some were downright despicable, but I found myself able to have empathy, if not sympathy, for most of the characters.<br />Rowling's writing is impeccable and her characters are fully realized and so well developed that she made me feel like I knew them. I could understand why they made the choices they made, even though they often affected their lives in profoundly negative ways. I will finish by saying that I got my happy ending, albeit a dark and twisted one for sure.<br />This is NOT HP, But, read it anyway.<br />Appreciate her great skill as  a storyteller and writer.
B00846REIS|5.0|Another good book by Sylvia Day. Looking forward to getting the next book so I can carry on through all her books
0596522347|5.0|Let's start off with the fact that I've made a pretty good living selling technology for the last 20+ years.<br />I've even had the good fortune to be a student in one of the best presentation skills classes offered in North America.<br />But, like all good things, they change with the times and if you don't keep up...well you know.<br />This is a very complete rendering of the thoughts, preparation, development, completion and implementation of great slide presentations. Worth every penny
B004MC8CA2|5.0|How can u not rate this five stars its the best selling book of all time for pete's sake! if you don't like the Bible its triply sad and distrounting..
0141040343|4.0|I got this for my daughter. The pretty cover made it more fun to give this amazing classic love story.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|We bought the life proof case for my 12 year old daughters IPhone 4. It lasted the high side of 5 days. The cheap made thin plastic sides started cracking and splitting. At the 5 day point it wouldn't even hold the phone. We contacted the manufacturer and they made every excuse possible to not honor the warranty. Buyer Beware! This is not an Otterbox Case! And should be out lawed in the USA. I have filed a complaint with the Consumer Protection Board on the quality vs. cost of this case. And I also question the waterproof ability of such a cheap made product. Unfortunately I don't have the Faith or Guts to test it myself. I am sure it would ruin her phone. For less money I will stick to the Otterbox case which is quality build and lives up to what it says it will do. This case reminds me of something you would get out of a 50 cent gum ball machine! Totally a piece of crap! You'd be better off putting your phone in a $5 case than this thing!!!!!!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Received promptly ... No problems. Our new favorite show! The characters are complex and (most) are very like-able! The cinematography is amazing ... Scenery and costumes like you've never seen before. Don't miss this series! Can't wait for season 3 which starts in January.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Not as good as season one but still pretty good.  Jessica Lange is always very good.  All the acting is rock solid.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|The movie is great.  I love it, and it came just as described.  There were no flaws with it.  I was pleased.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Remember you are watching two young (mentally) characters grow up.  Even though the material is very suggestive, the story line is still interesting.  I probably didn't care for it quite as much as my 2 friends who kept telling me to read, but I did read all three books
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|Did this advance the storyline in any way?  That answer would be a resounding NO!<br /><br />Ky is sent to the place where aberrations are sent to die.  Amazingly, Cassia finds him.  They separate again. They walk, search, see poisoned water, hunger, thirst and find the rebellion.<br /><br />Ky is a lot psycho.  Ky hates that his dad headed the rebellion.  He hates what his dad caused to happen to his family.  He is anti-rebellion.  He purposely made himself invisible and less than average in society.  He is angry with Cassia for trying to help him during the sort.  He keeps secrets from Cassia.  He doesn't want to open up to her.  Yet, he put his picture in as Cassia's match.  He purposely pursues her, even though he knows that by doing so he is turning her into an aberration just like his dad did to him.  He hides information about Xander, because he is afraid that if Cassia finds out she will like Xander more.  He joins the rebellion, even though he hates it to make himself more desireable to Cassia.  He is a predatory psycho.<br /><br />Cassia seems to desire sullen psychos.  She knows that Ky added his own picture in her match.  She knows Ky is not open about his life and is keeping secrets from her.  She knows Ky took a message from Xander that belonged to her, and he never said a word about it.  She knows enough to run fast.<br /><br />And it is made clear that the rebellion is actually led by the society.  A nice way to weed out troublemakers and keep an eye on the rebellion is to actually lead the rebellion.
B003YV64OI|4.0|I read that you can unlock the 4th core on these, however I was not able to on this one. Regardless it is a good processor and fast, 3 cores seems just fine!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a very good deal, and had everything I wanted in it.  It came as described.  I was pleased with this purchase.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Read this one and the first one at the advice of several friends.  Really good storyline if you get past the parts that may or may not offend.  You have to remember this is a grown up story with young slightly immature characters.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is a great cd!  I would recommend it to anyone.  These guys have some incredible talents on the piano and cello.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Can't say enough about it. I never pin, I'm just an observer. I just love to follow people with the same interest as me. It's always something new and different to look at! Like a new favorite magazine that is delivered every day! You have to try it....
B0030IIZ56|5.0|The movie is great.  I love it, and it came just as described.  There were no flaws with it.  I was pleased.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|REad all three.  Wasn't impressed with the fact that the 2 characters were like high school crushes in the way they communicated with each other.  But the story line was good if you could get past the shocking sexual parts.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Exactly what I wanted for my Husband. Got it ordered before he even knew there was a new album. Thank  you
B005NJU8PA|5.0|You'll enjoy reading it, he has a great easy going style<br />And it will only improve your life, through learning to cook or learning how to learn
B00932A2MC|2.0|Aliens attack, they just destroy our planet because they are aliens. Loser with no filters becomes winner overnight due to the alien invasion, boy becomes man, dates daughter of overprotective high ranking military officer who is also his boss, blah blah blah.<br /><br />I really, really wanted to enjoy this movie, but was constantly let down by the very predictable, very far-fetched plot. There were amusing and entertaining parts of the movie, and the effects were really impressive and reasonably believable. The movie was well produced, but in the end it was a well produced movie with good effects and a good cast who failed to deliver equally on story and character development.<br /><br />Two stars because I chuckled thrice and Brooklyn Decker is hot.
0525951652|4.0|Good book, 2nd book of triolgy.  Good ssstory line, historic in nature, lots of research done for this book and even if its fiction you still learn alot.
0307943232|5.0|My husband needed something to listen to on the road. He was done listening to music and talk radio. This was perfect.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The movie does drag a little, and it can be tough to follow, especially because bain is so dang hard to understand, but all in all it's a fitting end to a great trilogy.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|This is a nice Christmas CD by one of my favourite artists. I gave it 4 stars because I was expecting &#34;more&#34; based on having listened to her earlier recordings. Her earlier recordings are absolutely fantastic and they do set the bar rather high.
034580404X|3.0|This triolgy is not for everyone.  I thought it was boring and childishly written. Only read 3/4 of first book, none of the rest. Good part was I sold it right away so I didn't waste much time
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Great CD. Got it for my wife. She loves it. We seen Rod Stewart in Vegas in Oct. He announced his new Christmas CD then. Had to get it.
B000BO0QHW|5.0|Good price  and  Great service!!!!!!! Merchandise arrived promptly and undamaged due to excellent wrapping and packaging. I would highly recommend trading with these folks!.
B008G12ERC|5.0|We all tend to find ourselves looking for more of the familiar and the initial listen leaves us wanting if we do that, if we go in with preconceived expectations.  I remember when I first heard U2's \\"Achtung Baby\\" and had a serious WTF? moment.  But I kept listening and grew to love its stretching.  I think a lot of people who were disappointed by Evanescence's \\"The Open Door\\" were just expecting it to be as \\"singalongable\\" as \\"Fallen\\", but \\"Open Door\\" is far more interesting musically and lyrically, a far richer experience if you let yourself dive into it fresh.  The same thing happens with \\"The 2nd Law\\", and I'm not happy with the editorial review's subtle implication that this work is somehow not as good as previous works and that you should just give the guys some slack for \\"having fun\\".  On \\"The 2nd Law\\" the guys have put at least as much heart and soul and virtuosity and intelligence into their work as previous works.  Yes, you hear echoes of Queen, but it's done better as far as I'm concerned.  Yes, you hear the kinds of things you liked about \\"The Alan Parsons Project\\" back in the day, and Floyd and other timeless artists, but that's not because it's derivative, it's because timeless artists manage to hook into the timeless, and so do the artists who go by the name Muse, appropriately enough.  Buy this album.  Go in fresh.  You will dig it, and better yet you'll support the guys for continuing to stretch and to encourage us all to keep up the fight and to speak truths about human nature and human systems.  And by doing that you're helping to ensure we'll all get more Muse in the coming years.  I haven't been as enthused about new music in decades.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This movie is off the hook amazing in every way. Worth your time for sure. Season one was just as amazing!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|good, keeps you on the end of your seat, would watch again, but don't like batman's voice ,lots of action
B00005N6KG|5.0|Good price  and  Great service!!!!!!! Merchandise arrived promptly and undamaged due to excellent wrapping and packaging. I would highly recommend trading with these folks!.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I received a kindle as a christmas gift a few years ago and noticed the end that charges into the kindle had recently started fraying and was not able to stay connected to the charger port. I contacted amazon's amazing customer service team and they were able to send me a replacement free of charge. The new cable is more reinforced at the ends and has been working great!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The best I have ever read of John Grisham yet, and awaiting more in the coming months.<br />Tricky, wistful and fun.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It's fun because I already like the show.  Agent P is cute.<br />Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla. Sorry but I don't know what else to say.
B0084IRI9G|5.0|Good price  and  Great service!!!!!!! Merchandise arrived promptly and undamaged due to excellent wrapping and packaging. I would highly recommend trading with these folks!.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|I really loved this concert. Britney is great as usual. I don't understand why people thought that they covered her life voice? She is obviously singing life. You can hear the difference between CD sound and this concert sound. Anyway, I enjoyed it a lot and think that every Britney's fan would too. It's one of my favorite DVDs for workout. Boosts my energy and inspired to move faster! Love it!
B000002MX7|5.0|I love this Chaka Khan greatest hits CD. Yes a few songs are left off this Cd , I'm still very happy with what they decided to include.. although an inclusion of through &#34;Love you all my lifetime&#34;would have been nice.. from her later album. I enjoyed hearing this.Chaka can SANG,and this Cd is a must have for any real fan.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|The only thing I give 4 stars is that when I buy I need to wait for 2 weeks and the price is too high for and adapter
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|The gameplay is great - the controls are simple, the characters are cute, and the background music isn't the type that annoys you quickly. The way this application functioned on my kindle was a different story. The game froze a couple times or just shut off completely. After it shut off a few times I decided to uninstall, then download the game a second time. The app worked for a while, but then I started having the same issues. After a third attempt at installing the game, I decided to just give up and uninstall it permanently.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started off with the first book and at the end I just couldn't put it down, so I immediately bought the next 2.  This is a trilogy that grabs your attention and doesn't let go.
B007SGM084|3.0|I couldn't get past the horrible editing , if it was done at all.  E.L. James obviously has never heard of a thesaurus, using the same horrid adjectives and the inner goddess crap was...ugh.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I was looking for an app that would make finding some files I was downloading to my Kindle Fire easier to find. This app was the answer! I am able to create different folders and move files around in the folders. No more searching or wondering where a file is located!
B004SH40BQ|2.0|i ordered this so my ipod could work with my bluetooth head phones. however it does not work says it is not compatible, i have a 6th gen ipod nano, so according to other reviews it should be working. i am going to try it with another ipod nano i have, if it does not work with that one i will be asking for my money back...
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I was set on opera till an update started causing force close issues. Out of annoyance of the opera deal, I had to find something better. Dolphin has a nice layout and is supported by the developers. It will allow you to watch the video in an article you are reading unlike chrome and opera.
B009EEG8J0|5.0|I like robots. It is a funny movie that helps lift your spirits. It makes you laugh at things that we would normally take for granted. Like upgrades ( new clothes) for replacement parts ( hand me downs).<br />It is a really good movie for all ages.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Yes, I am a huge Twilight fan and I love this movie. This dvd came in a timely manner with no damage. The movie is wonderful. Thanks
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I bought this series after all the Emmy's hype it got.  My family thoroughly enjoyed watching it for 3-straight days.  But could not wait for the next season to be offered at the great Amazon price and value
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|if you want try out the game for free, go to [...] (on computer, its a flash game).  I am a mega game critic...and I highly recommend this game...I mean it is totally epic!! its worth the 70$ their selling it for on the computer...this is awesome!!!!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Very useful!!! Especially when my other alarm died.<br />I like the fact that I can use music to wake me up and not just  a loud beeping.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|Same old story line......it's ok and is easy to watch. The whole story was very predictable and one could guess the ending.
B008MILL9G|5.0|Great 3-part story of an all-star cast. Watched it one after the other and enjoyed it much more.  Now I miss Bernie Mac
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game very fun to play. it entertains me a lot. ive been trying to find this tam but I couldn't find at first and I'm glade I did find it
B002BWCJOA|4.0|This is a really cute movie. Alot of kids always say what if? Well, here is good answer to 'what if I had another mom?'. The grass isn't always greener on the other side. I love the talking cat. Very well laid out story.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Perfect condition was sealed when I got one of the best shows ever made cant wait to get other seasons on bluray
1881273377|5.0|This CD was helpful for understanding the nature of choosing your own personal love language. Download the survey to help you learn more.
1451695195|5.0|A cogent and compelling account of Dr. Eben Alexander,a teaching neurosurgeon, &#34;experiences&#34; when in a 7 day brain dead coma.  Well worth reading!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I have seen all the Star Trek Movies. This is another one of those that is great. It has that subtle comedy that Bones has. They used the perfect cast for this movie.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|this app is awesome because you don't have to do it in you head or on a piece of paper.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|If you love megadeth and want to read a great story. Give this a shot, it has a lot of inside information and old pictures that show you what it was like back then
B008XG1X18|1.0|I actually would give it a ZERO!!!  because it won't download to my kindle.  Have been trying to download it for a week now!
B0024SQW2Q|4.0|I really like vampire movies. I started watching the first movie and had to collect the rest. It is a good follow up to the first movie. It brings to light why the lycans are hated by the vampires and vice versa. It also holds the romance within the story well.
B0086700CM|1.0|I could not move my fingers fast enough to complete the game. I think it will work better if a joy stick
B0035V35P8|5.0|This movie was very great! Good storyline and action! I would not recommend this to someone who doesn't like gore or blood though, there's a lot of that. But for me, it was fine. I'd expect someone who likes other ninja movies to like this.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son played this on his aunts tablet and came home and begged me to get it on my kindle.<br />He loves it!!!!
B00005JA2B|5.0|After several decades , i bought this again.I was surprised how good all the songs still are.There is not one track that you want to skip.Even more :'Magnum Opus' must be one of the best prog-rock tracks ever composed.Bravo!
B008N1LL42|4.0|So I'm a big Liam Neeson fan...and that's one reason I bought the movie. But he has about 10 minutes of face time in this 2+ hour movie...so don't get it if you're looking to gaze at Liam through the whole thing.<br /><br />The storyline is good, the CG imagery is top-notch, and it's full of new faces. Gives a nod to our war veterans too, which I thought was really classy.<br /><br />Bought it digitally and stream it HD it from Amazon on my Blu-Ray player. Amazon Prime rocks!
0439023521|4.0|Overhyped? Would not be the correct wording. It is a good book, and i would read the others if i had the time.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Very limited drawing program, I should have known for a dollar. Will continue research and view others recommendations into stronger programs.
B001BW02B8|5.0|This band never ceases to amaze! I was pleased to have the bonus tracks! This is definitely worth the purchase.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a smart game. Makes you think. Can give you hints, but who wants them. Right? Okay, maybe after trying to get through some of the puzzles a dozen times...well...I have peeked.<br /><br />This is a great game. It is really smooth, and has a great look to it. I really like it.
B008M34CSI|4.0|Good movie. Would recommend to action movie oriented people. Lockout is a movie for people who would like action movies.
0099519852|4.0|This is an amazing book! It talks about master coaches and how they affect us through certain qualities they have developed, ignition (why we are motivated to develop talents) and the best way to actually develop talents through deep practice.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|There are so many twists here! I thoroughly enjoyed the story but the characters were especially interesting to me. I highly recommend it. I have already ordered the next part of the trilogy.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I'm hooked on this series. I don't want it as tv series ,I don't want it as a movie I want another well written book
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Worth a 5. Would buy if you watched the other videos. It is very very very very very very very good.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|you can't beat this product for the price from any where on line or off. i will tell all my friends about this deal.
B001I8A76A|5.0|Pink is my favorite artist of all time and I have never been disappointed by any of her albums.  Fun house is no exception to her rule of perfection.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|An antidote for anyone whose attitude about war is based on John Wayne (or Sylvester Stallone) movies.<br /><br />One of the saddest books I've ever read.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|Wire gets in the way. Wire was on the wrong side of where my ps3 was. would not recommend this.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|just a amazing show<br />all should watch<br />its amazing how mr white out smarts everyone and slowly is becoming the most dangerous person<br /><br />once malcoms dad now a drug king pin
6302453356|5.0|Good for entire family.  The actors and actresses do a marvelouse job with their parts. Well worth the money spent!
B003XRELGQ|5.0|More great work by Vonnegut.  His insights into what is and isn't true are profound.  His commentary on the human condition are painfully accurate.  He lets you stand back and see life for what it is.
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|Buy this movie if you have blu ray and you are willing to watch the whole thing. It is terrific.
B009FBX5M0|4.0|why does it not contain the title song. it is one of the main reasons for purchasing it...?!??<br />it contains great tracks from the film itself but it does lack a touch of Bond...while the typical Bond pieces may be in there, they are far too few...but hey, it is another time period for Bond I guess...
B0009HKH6Q|2.0|an all-time great movie and one of my favorites.McQueen at his best.Excellent film work,acting et al.<br /><br />the problem with this item is the item itself.<br /><br />dvd comes in a &#34;slim&#34; case (not a standard dvd case)and plays like an illegal bootleg and not the licensced copy that I paid for.this was shipped amazonprime but is not an amazon product.I would avoid that merchant by all means! The picture quality is good only and the audio quality is so poor that even at max volume on my television, I could hardly hear the dialogue.one of the few total disappointments I have encountered with amazon.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This was better than the last few Scarpetta's...and although I enjoy all her books, they had been veering off course lately- at least, in my opinion.  I really liked the back to basics Scarpetta with an original MO that takes some serious medical examiner skills to figure out!  Kept me guessing.
B00005JLEU|5.0|who hasn't seen this movie? So worthy of paying a lot of money for. Disney strikes again with this movie.
B00633W614|5.0|I recently read Jeffrey Archer's second book in the Clifton Chronicles series, The Sins of the Father. Archer's story-telling technique leaves one anticipating the next book, if for no reason but to see how the situation at the end of one book works out in the next. Having read several of Archer's books in the past, I was eager to dive into another one. One has to admire Mr. Archer's announced plan to cover roughly 100 years in the life of a British family in five volumes. Now that he has me hooked, I look forward to reading the last three volumes in this set.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn,s books I find continuity in the caricatures from book to book berry enjoyable.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift, though it is a gift to us both. I don't mind him gaming at all, but I enjoy not listening to the sounds of guns and such. This way he can play the game as loudly as he'd like while I sit and read not hearing a thing! The sound is great as well, I use it to listen to music on the occasion.
B002361MLA|5.0|My doctor recommended this book to me, I have been dealing with stress at work, this book has changed everything
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Not only is this a compelling story with a few philosophical twists, the writing is absolutely superb. You can read virtually any chapter to someone and it will read like delicious poetry.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|i have a problem believing the whole story - some of which I feel was made up to be able to write a whole book.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like the game. It could be a little better. I think the WiFi could be turn in and off.<br />I like the game it is good over all.
B0017OB12O|5.0|I highly recommend these product, it's a real collectable item, with great extra material. It deserves the 7 Oscars it got in 1958, and it's really a DVD you will want to have in your collection. But don't put it together with your other DVDs, put it somewhere where it's well stored and where people can see it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have this app on my Kindle Fire and I absolutely love it. I linked it to my Facebook account and have never had any problems logging in. I wasn't really ever crafty or interested in recipes until I discovered Pinterest. Now I am totally addicted to the whole site :-)
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My entire family loves this movie (especially my 4-year-old). Family-friendly for all ages and great catchy songs. Good message behind the story also.
B0019O6IWU|3.0|A useful book but worksheets in Kindle format don't really work. Kindle edition needs to significantly cheaper. I wish I'd bought hard copy
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Great film with and now with a great Gift Set.This is a product that should be on the bookshelf of every collector
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My granddaughter loves to play with this app  She is learning how to do some basic cooking while having fun!!!
B0057RCFQS|5.0|My bf has been looking for these everywhere and has had no luck. I finally found them. cant wait till he opens christmas day!
B005KELQEU|3.0|It's a thick, bulky case for a svelte, lightweight ereader. And it doesn't fit well.<br /><br />There are lots of Kindle cases available. My advice to you is, choose a different one.
B008UTV43K|4.0|Is this an album for the jazz purist? Probably not. Is it a record likely to be embraced by hardcore Krall fans who want her to keep doing the same thing disc after disc? Nope. It is, however, a collection of playful, fun songs wonderfully performed and expertly recorded. I like this long-player very much, and I find Ms. Krall appearing to fully embrace moving outside her and, more precisely, her fans' comfort zone, a refreshing change to her typical, albeit expertly performed, take on the jazz canon. Great job.<br /><br />And with that said, there are still enough jazzy gems on this to please the \\"fan.\\"<br /><br />I must point out that the vinyl is beautiful. Heavy, straight and well mastered with good quality control. And it goes without saying that the cover art in the 12x12 format of the vinyl is, frankly, worth the price of admission.<br /><br />By the way, I bought my copy of this at my local record shop (The Record Exchange, Boise) for the same price it is being sold here. Don't forget to support your local merchants!
B00A757EFW|1.0|the controls are awful.  The game is worth what I paid for it.  Which is nothing.  Don't waste your time getting this app.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|My bf has been looking for these everywhere and has had no luck. I finally found them. cant wait till he opens christmas day!
0198711905|1.0|Other reviews have complained of the binding and the printing, but a much more major flaw infects the Oxford Shakespeare (from which the Norton Shakespeare is derived): the editing of Shakespeare's texts themselves. The editors seem to have been driven by a desire to make a splash, even if this meant questionable and arbitrary editing of the texts, and so the Oxford Shakespeare features such oddness as:<br /><br />* Two versions of King Lear, 90% identical and each missing some familiar lines (the Norton has three versions)<br />* A Macbeth that has had non-Shakespearean material added in to it, allowing it to be co-credited to Thomas Middleton (one editor is a Middleton fan)<br />* A Hamlet that has lost some of its most significant passages to an appendix<br />* Significant, damaging cuts to many of the other plays<br />* A Pericles with huge chunks of non-Shakespearean material added in, all of it terrible.<br />* Falstaff renamed to \\"Oldcastle\\" in Henry IV Part 1, though not in Part 2<br />* Wholly new stage directions that have been added in without note<br />* A horribly inept poem, \\"Shall I die\\", near-universally agreed upon not to be by Shakespeare, yet claimed as such<br /><br />So be aware that you will be reading versions of the plays that are substantially different than from what most people have read over the last century, or indeed, the last few centuries. And, usually, substantially worse versions. The changes tend to damage the plays, not improve them.

B001D0BLTA|4.0|I liked this movie but hated the ending. I thought she was better off with Ducky and that the ohter guy messed up too many times to make her happy later.
0525952616|4.0|I enjoyed this book and by the end I was turning pages. It did take me a while to get into it though. For the first couple of chapters I found it a little confusing and there way too many acronyms. That all aside,  the subject of drones was very thought provoking, and timely. I hope that this book is a conversation opener for those in positions of influence.

0199267170|1.0|Other reviews have complained of the binding and the printing, but a much more major flaw infects the Oxford Shakespeare (from which the Norton Shakespeare is derived): the editing of Shakespeare's texts themselves. The editors seem to have been driven by a desire to make a splash, even if this meant questionable and arbitrary editing of the texts, and so the Oxford Shakespeare features such oddness as:<br /><br />* Two versions of King Lear, 90% identical and each missing some familiar lines (the Norton has three versions)<br />* A Macbeth that has had non-Shakespearean material added in to it, allowing it to be co-credited to Thomas Middleton (one editor is a Middleton fan)<br />* A Hamlet that has lost some of its most significant passages to an appendix<br />* Significant, damaging cuts to many of the other plays<br />* A Pericles with huge chunks of non-Shakespearean material added in, all of it terrible.<br />* Falstaff renamed to \\"Oldcastle\\" in Henry IV Part 1, though not in Part 2<br />* Wholly new stage directions that have been added in without note<br />* A horribly inept poem, \\"Shall I die\\", near-universally agreed upon not to be by Shakespeare, yet claimed as such<br /><br />So be aware that you will be reading versions of the plays that are substantially different than from what most people have read over the last century, or indeed, the last few centuries. And, usually, substantially worse versions. The changes tend to damage the plays, not improve them. The Norton Edition removes some of the most grotesque alterations (like Falstaff/Oldcastle), but hardly enough to undo the damage.

B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I am still getting acquainted with this game,but so far the puzzles have benn interesting. Seems like I will keep playing it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a well written escape from reality that always keeps you guessing about who's going to bite the dust next. The acting is pretty good, and the zombies look real. The storyline is exciting and often surprising. Watching the Walking Dead is a good way to spend a Sunday evening.
B000W93CHC|2.0|I loved Pillars of the Earth when it was released and looked forward to continuing the story. I just cannot get past the quality if the writing.  It feels like it is written at a fourth-grade level.  The characters are flat and the story just doesn't capture my imagination. It's a big disappointment because it's the first book I bought with whispersync and I'm not even going to get to use it.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|I purchased for $24.57, but the Bluray inside had a sticker on it for $15.99. That was a little disappointing.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|The blu-ray edition of this is fantastic. This collection had the 3 main variants of the movie and so much extras. I loved the cut scenes and could see how each, if put in, would change the flavor of the movie. In the end it's up to you to decide which version is your favorite. My favorite is the original with narration.<br /><br />For fans, I recommend this. All the detail is there in blu ray. The cut scenes in themselves add so much to the background story and a new depth. Ridley sure shot a lot of takes that are not used.<br /><br />Once I started watching, I had to keep going into the exteas as this brought back do much memories. This still holds up to anything made today.
0312106122|5.0|I find this time and place in history fascinating and Wilber Smith has outdone himself with this particular book. A series follows but none come even close to this one.  &#34;Seventh Scroll&#34; is commercial and unbelievable in comparison for example.  River God sucks you right into Ancient Egypt and the characters become friends of yours, people you care about and empathize with.  The art of historical fiction at it's finest execution.
0743277457|5.0|I would absolutely recommend this to anyone that is serious about certain profession or hobby.  It is a great book discussing how to hone your craft.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Repinning's too hard.<br />On my Fire, it is very difficult to repin. Makes it a pain to use. Don't use it often.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The feed is definitely not working well.  It doesn't show all the posts and they aren't even in chronological order when they do show.  Please fix the feed!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I find this game to be a great way to get a quick game fix and pretty additive at that!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app works great. I love to lay in bed and pin to my heart's content on my Amazon Kindle. :)
B00881VLCE|3.0|I had to subtract two stars because I can't save my game if I need to take a break. Otherwise, I really enjoy the puzzles, especially the ability to choose how many pieces to use.  There is a good variety of free picture collections to pick, making this a truly free app.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I'm a big fan of magazines, and Flipboard lets you customize a feed of stories that might interest you.  Its super easy to &#34;flip&#34; through the headlines and summaries of the stories, then read the complete ones that interest you.  The best part:  its free!
0547884591|5.0|This book has so many things to love I don't even know where to begin.  I'm only up to page 50 and already I feel like this book will have a significant impact on my life - in so many areas.  I'll write a more complete assessment when I've finished it- but for now, let's just say this might be the best book you could give ANYONE on your Christmas list.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|i liked the book alot i would say you should read it also it is such a good book i wish i had the real book i love the book
B001CEE1YE|5.0|If you're a fan its totally worth the price. It's blue ray so you know the picture is great and the price is even better.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoy all the Harry Bosch Novels.  This one rates right upthere as it builds up to the climax.  Just what I like in a Connelly book.  The ending was a suprise.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Quality was great, so convenient having the episodes available for purchase on Amazon so we can watch them at our own pace! I would definitely recommend buying them to anyone, they make a great &#34;night-in&#34; activity or for a rainy weekend! And you don't have to wait for the season to be added on Netflix!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|We try to pick up a new Christmas CD each year, to add to our eclectic collection of Christmas jazz, contemporary and big-band favorites.  Bublé is a favorite in our non-Christmas collection, and his prior Christmas CD - 'Let It Snow' (2007) - is much requested in our house.  So we knew we had to pick up 'Christmas' (2011).<br /><br />Bublé delivers again.  If you like his music -- and if you're in the market for Christmas music -- I think it's safe to say you will like this CD.  In fact, you've probably already purchased it and have been enjoying it.  But if you're considering the purchase, go ahead and do it.  This is a nice sized collection -- 15 songs -- and it includes Bublé's take on a number of 20th century classics: White Christmas, Holly Jolly Christmas, and Blue Christmas, among others.  Just the thing to put you in the mood for a bit of egg nog and snow.  Recommended.
0393327655|5.0|If by the end of this read, people of faith are not seriously reconsidering the doctrines they previously subscribed to then I would feel confident in saying that there is likely no hope for that individual's ascent from the abyss that is religion.
030758836X|2.0|The book just got lucky because while reading I found it to be pretty average. It was lacking in depth and the story wasn't all that different from any other mystery book. I'm surprised that it's been so popular. Just goes to show you can't always trust the \\"best sellers\\" list!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie was just as funny the whole way through as it was in the previews! The cast was a perfect pick! It made me laugh.. it made me cry! I love Seth MacFarland even more now!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The title accurately describes my opinion. It is really fun. Definitely worth downloading. If I had to choose a word to describe this game the word would be fun.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|I normally do not review movies. But i watched this with my girlfriend, and we were both begging for it to be over. Chinese water torture would probably have been better. This film lacks everything thats makes a good film worth watching. I am surprised that so many people have given it good reviews. I recommend not watching it. But thats jut my opinion.
B00005M989|4.0|Prince is prince...misunderstood, confused, but sexy as hell when he is front of a mic and letting go...I saw a youtube interview of him with maria bartolomo from back in the day, and theres no denying she was in love (read lust) with him at times during the interview...you gotta check it out..!
0756405890|5.0|it is the magic ,the msticism and then the brute force of reality that appeals to my imagination.<br />ego -cenntric - not belonging to the social order and knowing he can never submit to the foolish wiles of men<br />must rise aboe for his being is n the esoteric .  QUESTION CAN A THIRD BOOK REACH THE HEIGHT OF EXPECTATION CAN YOU REALLY REACH ABOVE AND BEYOND
0345803493|5.0|Read book one so of course I had to buy book two. I certainly wasn't disappointed. Ordered the 3rd one as well. Recommend it to anyone who likes sexy novels.
B003IDMUX6|5.0|The moment I started reading this book, I wanted to continue<br />Till the end. I really enjoyed it till the end.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Nice, but no real surprises. Not exactly a thriller as most Grishams are, but you can see the ending coming from a mile away.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I enjoy this game. I like games that are fun but you don't have to think a lot to play them.<br /><br />I just get lost in the fun of it.  Most will enjoy this game.
0345803507|5.0|I loved the first book, I loved the second book, and of course I loved the 3rd book. I recommend this trilogy to anyone who likes love/sexy novels.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I feel most ppl can agree the dark knight was masterpiece. That being said this movie had a lot to live up to. Overall this movie had a strong storyline with some epic action. You may hear ppl saying the movie was too drawn out; I personally  did not feel that way. The best news is this movie suggest more sequels possibly<br />.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|Even though the story of Dave Mustaine & Metallica has been Behind The Music-ed to death, this book still offered dozens of new stories I'd never heard before. It also gives a powerful look at the rise of Megadeth, and a humorous take on the drugs, sex & rock roll lifestyle.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This is one of my favorite games.  It is a match 3 type and is easy but a lot of fun.
0345803485|5.0|I ordered the book after I heard all the hype about it. Of course I wasn't disappointed. I've already ordered and read the second and third book. I recommend to anyone who likes love/sexy novels.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|Is one of the best movies ever, I loved it and would recommend it to anyone, a great love story!
B00ADS98FC|3.0|Acting was not well done. It is Glee in a movie. Would be better as a video collection of the groups doing their performances.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|For historians, David Lean's remarkable film fails to accurately tell the story of this enigmatic figure and that's just the way T.E. Lawrence would have wanted it. Lawrence is portrayed as military cartographer seemingly out of touch with the region when, in reality, while still in his late teens he embarked on a dangerous journey,  traveling the region for an entire year, risking life and limb.<br /><br />So, why 5 stars?<br /><br />As a film it's superb cinematic art. A rousing story, exotic locations beautifully lensed with an exceptional cast headed by a star-making performance by Peter O'Toole. David Lean was a master at the top of his game when he made 'Lawrence' and managed to meld a sprawling epic with a highly personal drama. This is the kind of film that was made for the Blu-ray format which preserves the richness and depth of the original 70mm image.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|James Taylor Christmas album is great because I am a big fan of James Taylor, and his music is awesome!
1439102813|5.0|Still Alice is a very informative and thought provoking book about Alzheimer's disease.  It is written from Alice's perspective, a woman in her 50's, who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's and how she and her family deal with the devastating affects it has on their lives.<br /><br />This book helped to establish a great awareness of the early symptoms of Alzheimer's and painted an excellent, but grim picture of how this disease progresses.  This is not an easy disease to diagnose, especially those people with early-onset.  So many times it can be a long and arduous journey when symptoms are mistaken for other illnesses.<br /><br />The storyline did not unfold into a happy ending, but leaves you with a saddened heart.  A beautifully written book that I highly recommend.
0740797719|5.0|This book is amazing.  So much essential information for artists on color and light.  The best part was the way it is presented, very easy to understand.  Each topic is one page, clearly explained and so interesting.  To me, this book is a must have for any artist.
B007STBUIW|4.0|I bought the Blu-ray version for two reasons: (1) the high res version of the film and (2) the included documentary THE SHARK IS STILL WORKING which never got wide release. The Blu-ray transfer is outstanding and the documentary, along with the other extras make this a great collectible.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|i like the idea of fantasy. this was just silly immature humor. rhey could have wrote better dialogue for rhis movie then what they had.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|One of the best shows on TV! Hope they make a few more Seasons and keep it on a little longer.
082300659X|5.0|What I have read and seen in this book so far is excellent.  Drawing is the basis for all art and very important, no matter what medium an artist uses.  While I haven't had a lot of time to work from this book, it and its DVD look to be very well done.  A friend has this book and has done more work with it and highly recommends it.
B003FM1MNO|5.0|Awesome, even after viewing several times! 2nd movie in trilogy and it always delivers. Have to watch all three in a weekend!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|My husband and I play it with my 3 year old. We think it's fun. It took my daughter a few games to get the hang of it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|So far i have really enjoyed it. Great addition to the angry bird collection. Although I have only had for a day and haven't gotten very far just yet
0061650994|5.0|I read this book to my students who are not able to yet handle the complete story.  They just loved this book.  It was a great overview of the story, and the illustrations are beautiful.  One student keeps borrowing it to read over and over.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|my daughter just got the new kindle HD and installed this app for free.. but when i went to check to see if i could get this for the older orginal version it showed i had already gotten it.. but it never showed up on my kindle. why does this only work for the newer version??
B008VBYN80|5.0|I just have to say this is the best game I have ever played nothing is wrong with it<br />&quot;
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Especially interesting coming from a neurosurgeon. The in depth information was excellent. er<br />For &#34;naysayersi&#34; this book is truly eye-opening in regards to what happens after we die.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|How can I not love a game that I can get so engrossed on that I can't play it on a day where I have too much stuff to do because once I start playing with it I'll forget what I'm supposed to ACTUALLY be doing!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I loved being lost in this book.  Great characterizations typical of my favorite writer.  Would love to read the sequel.
B008BYXQJY|5.0|I really enjoy this band! I'm so happy I bought this album because now I can put it on my iPod!
B004HW7JH4|4.0|I like this season as the previous ones. After the end it remain a sort of sour feeling since all the characters have a dark side or are completely dark.
B004529NKC|5.0|I bought it as a gift for my sister because she likes this movie, and I'm looking forward to her opening it on Christmas!
B000IZ7YK6|2.0|I hated this movie.  It was boreing... Though it had a good twist.  The incest in this movie was too much for me.
B005LAIHYU|2.0|What an idea! This is the most stupid (although entertaining) film I've seen these last years. And now what? George Washington a werewolf hunter, Bill Clinton a temporary female worker hunter?...
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I love that I can play and ask for hints whenever I want. Great when I don't want to think too hard.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Best TV show ever. The music, the photography, the scenes, everything is great. Don't miss this amazing tv show. Must
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I love these kinds of movies, but I wasn't expecting such a raunchy movie with an incredible heart.  Not the biggest fan of Family Guy, but Seth made one hell of a movie!  I rented it before buying, but I knew I would own it during the opening sequence with Patrick Stewart doing the narration.<br /><br />If you're not sure, it's worth at least a rental.  Make your decisions then.  More than likely, if you like shock comedy...you will want to own this!  This is the funniest movie I've seen since &#34;pAUL&#34;.
B001CDLATE|5.0|The film is fantastic.  The box it came in is pretty flimsy though.  It actually makes the package feel bootleg, even though it's not.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Fast shipping, excellent condition - just as advertised! what a classic must have, GREAT!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a fabulous sequal to the first book! Ken Follett is an amazing reader! You are going to be sad when you are done with it!
0761169431|5.0|Nice quality and the paper is nice and vibrant. I only wish that I could buy more of the printed papers without buying the whole book again.
0439023521|5.0|GOOD love it. Came fast, works good, look forward to ordering fom here again. Hope this helped you out. (:
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played! Get it now! Seriously, I saw a girl playing it, so I tried it on my kindle fire, and it WORKS GREAT! Again, AMAZING on a Kindle Fire!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Rodriguez was also known to us in the late 1970's / early 1980's in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), a small country north of South Africa. At that time our country was undergoing a civil war and a lot of children were schooled in Boarding Schools, as it was safer living at school than living at home on farms, as farms ran the risk of armed terrorist attacks.<br /><br />As idle boarding school teenagers we listened to COLD FACT on our communal record player nearly every afternoon, scratched vinyl 'schkt-schkt' included.<br /><br />As teenagers, these wise words and lyrics were correctly accepted at life-truth's and philosophy lessons - listen carefully and mull over the words.<br /><br />Now, more than 30 years later I see this touching story unfold further. A truly wise man who superficially seemed to 'fail' in his resident country, yet unknowingly in other parts of the world (Southern Africa, Australia and parts of Europe) in places probably unknown to him, he was a huge success at positively influencing and teaching thousands with his wise words.<br /><br />This story fittingly reminds us that LIFE works in strange ways.<br /><br />Mr Rodriguez, I salute you and I thank you.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT DICKENS' CLASSIC THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN SAID? NOTHING.  GREAT STORY.  MY CHILDREN ALWAY LOVE READING THIS BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  DON'T BE A HUMBUG AND DOWNLOAD THIS.....IT WAS FREE AND SCROOGE WOULD DEFINITELY LOVE THAT!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had resisted watching Downton because someone is always on TV urging us to &#34;get into&#34; a certain series, &#34;It;s the best, it's profound, and such&#34;; however, Downton really is profound.  The British are so good in the detail needed in a period piece.
B003PJ6UHA|1.0|I did not enjoy this book because it uses all sorts of scientific criteria to criticize standard scientific theories (which as such is a very good thing) but then he goes on to pose the most exotic theory himself but 'forgets' to apply the same hard scientific critique to his own theory. This book is no better than any old new age sort of hocus pocus! Not convincing and not scientific despite the use of scientific language!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Just into the book it is like every other Vince Flynn books..........you don't want to put it down. I have enjoyed ready his books and have read everyone that he has published. I highly recommend reading this book for sure.....but also read the other ones too......you will not be disappointed....
0553207083|5.0|This is a classic book about man and why he does what he does. First book that taught me why some folks wash their car and some don't. Explains well how the western culture missed the quality boat, accepting ROI numbers--excel sheets loaded with BS numbers--smoke up the back side--- quantity instead of QUALITY.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Constant interruptions while playing the game, not after a level. When the ads don't even load and end up closing the program, progress lost an  frustration sets in. WHY PLAY ADS ANYWAYS, I DON'T OR WON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM AN AD, EVER!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This book is ok, I thought that there would be more time on the raid itself than all the training etc.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|this game is great but it takes up lots of storage. it may have big price but is definetly worth it. anyone who enjoys sonic or likes adventure games this is the game for you. also their is a retern of an old friend tails. PLEASE CONSIDER BUYING. and if you loke this game i advise you buy the other sonic games created by Sega of America. enjoy&hellip;
B001RIY4WE|5.0|T2 skynet edition is the best version yet includes all versions of the movie this blu ray has it all awesome quality everything good about this blu ray T2 will always be my favorite sci-fi movie no other cybrog movie can make you cry like T2.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|Well..Some Disney movies are cheesy when you get older but...Lemonade Mouth is not the one it's so good I could watch it 24/7.<br /> I really like Bridget Mendler in this movie she is one good actress.<br /> Adam Hicks did a really good job to he's just a nice guy in the movie and just you start to love him.<br /> This movie is great I totally suggest buying this movie.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This is a look at the foster care system and its impact on not only foster children,<br />but all the participants.  It has a nice story with good characters. I did not find the coincidences<br />or the changes in the characters always believable, but that might what makes it a &#34;novel&#34;.
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|I gave the HD camera a four star rating because I am very impressed with the quality of the photos it takes.  The only reason I did not rate it five was because it can only take photos looking at the screen.  But, they are of good quality.
B000062V9C|1.0|Had to return the movie.  It did not work. Tried it in three different players.  Bought the movie for my grandson and will try buying it again.
B0063IH60K|3.0|When it is time to start another game, the tab is slow to respond.  Otherwise the game is okay for fun.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Disappointed with the language.  Rowling has already shown she can write without profanity in the Harry Potter books but for some reason has chosen to believe that an adult book must have juvenile coarse language.  Didn't get past the first chapter before putting the book down for good.  Too many expletives.
B000NJVWUA|3.0|As an old APP fan, I look back on this album as the first sign that the Project was beginning to decline.  It's not that the quality of musical performance or production was lacking; it was the selection of material that got me.<br /><br />There are five good-to-excellent cuts on this CD.  \\"Prime Time\\" and \\"Don't Answer Me\\" were both deserving top-40 hits in 1984.  \\"You Don't Believe\\" (which actually first appeared on the \\"Best Of\\" album that preceded this one) charted top-50 in 1983 and fits well with the first two. \\"Dancing On A High Wire\\" and the instrumental \\"Pipeline\\" are both quite listenable.  \\"Prime Time\\" might be my favorite song this band ever recorded.  So - half the album is, at the least, very good.<br /><br />Countering these are four absolute turkeys:  \\"Let Me Go Home,\\" which tries to be a rocker but comes up short (to my mind, this song is very much like Gaudi's \\"Money Talks\\").  \\"One Good Reason\\" just doesn't appeal to me at all - especially on the rhythmic side. There is an interlude that is entirely bass-and-percussion which was gag-inducing.  The hideous \\"Since the Last Goodbye\\" tries to be wistful, but only succeeds in gelding itself.  And \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" - what were these guys thinking?  It came across like someone rewriting the lyrics to \\"New York, New York\\" to make the song praise Lubbock, Texas instead. Epic?  Nuh-uh.<br /><br />By advice - go ahead and buy it for the good tracks, but don't say you weren't warned about the flops.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like that I can put in more than one location, but still have my home as my favorite.  Also, I like that I can get lots of detailed information on any location.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love it. Couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to read the 2nd which I'm about to download. It's almost as good as fifty shades of gray.
B000NJVWTQ|2.0|There are really only two (well, three, if you count the reprise) high points on this album: \\"La Sagrada Familia\\" and \\"Standing On Higher Ground.\\"  Most of the rest of the work is theme-based in theory, but seems unfocused and actually rather dull. \\"Inside Looking Out\\" is a snooze-fest that ends in a babble of voices leading into the repise of \\"Sagrada,\\" and \\"Money Talks\\" doubles down on the Pink Floyd references (and is not even remotely close to being as good or imaginative as the original \\"Money\\").  If you can get the three good cuts elsewhere, go ahead and get them and leave the rest of it; you're not missing much.
B00AHCF9E8|5.0|Of their three UNO DOS TRE albums, this one is by far my favorite. It has a little more of the sound from American Idiot and Breakdown, which I really liked.
0061537969|5.0|One of the best book I ever read. You cry and laugh...in the end, you realize what &#34;unconditional&#34; love is.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I thought this one was just as good as the others, and I actually liked it better than book 4 because my favorite characters are back.  There were surprising twists and turns, and I became even more invested in the characters.  Can't wait for the next one!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I d/l this app yesterday after two other weather apps refused to work on my Kindle Fire HD.  This gives me accurate up to the minute weather information that is quite accurate.  I just hope it keeps working.  Thus far I am very happy with it.<br /><br />Knight68

B009PNQUXO|1.0|IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!! i was very disappointed.  I love to have my kindle next to me while I am working on my computer and Pandora keeps stopping and Iheart radio (eh not sure if I like that one either) - but you tube you can pick and choose was music adn/or videos.  So again, what a disappointment!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I love The Walking Dead.  Season 2 looks great on Blu-RAY.  Great addition to my collection. Definitely recommend to my friends.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Very good points brought up by the author.  Pretty easy read even with the science support discussions to back up the claims.  Worth anyone's time trying to live a healthier life.
B00APUQJLO|4.0|A strange movie, you'll like it or loath it, probably no middle ground here. I really like Cronenbergs work, so I wasn't too surprised at the movie. It's not for everyone :)
0061906220|3.0|It's ok.  I must not be in love as most people are with this book.  It repeats the same few words over and over again but that is good for kids to learn I guess. There is no lesson with mixing colors that's for sure.  We read it but it's not our favorite by any means.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have nothing to say that hasn't been said by all of the other reviewers. I don't know if I've ever read a book that's affected me like this one has. I cried (four times, unusual for me), I laughed, and most importantly, I fell in love with these characters and felt their pain with them.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|One of my family members talks about this movie almost every time we see them.  So this is going to be a great present!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I do not like the app! You can only read about 10 (or less)  statuses in the news feed. The fb app is very limited to say the least.
B003EY9UZU|5.0|1080p would be terrific!!! Picture quality is a must, Don't know why it can't be better? Everybody want's picture quality to be at it's best. All pay movies should be 1080p. Also newer releases would help to view more!

B002N5N5LG|5.0|Community is a great TV show. I recommend this DVD to fans and new comers alike. You will not be disappointed. It's hilarious, heartwarming, and has great themed episodes. You will fall in love with these characters! Not to mention the actual packaging of the DVD set is amazing. It makes it even more worth the money.

B001IMFHTS|5.0|I have many DVDs of these symphonies, but not all nine in one set. Abbado is a great conductor, leading a great orchestra with<br /> feeling and inspiration. The music speaks for itself but the rendition is absolutely superb. Buy the set now.
B00A2YAY3C|5.0|One of the best war movies were made. Very true to the real event . Filmed at the actual location, fantastic cast
1400067820|5.0|Fascinating and mind changing. Don't read it. Study it. Probably one of the best books I ever read. Taleb is a master and \\"Antifragility \\"; will change the way you think of things and life. It is  not a book for leisure reading. You need to put all your concentration into it with definite positive results. I feel enriched after reading it.
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|This is a great light, beach read. Don't expect a literary masterpiece. It's fun and lighthearted - similar to Bridgette Jones.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Took awhile to get into this one, but turned out to be a decent book. This wasn't the best book I have read, but not too bad.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Pretty good book, keeps you interested throughout, but not as good as the first 4 or 5.  Had a little bit of &#34;Red Storm Rising&#34; mixed in with generous doses of the John Clark/Ding Chavez action.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Simply brilliant! There are so many relatable and relevant life lessons in this book. A must read for any teen.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Many of the stories and anecdotes are mirrored in &#34;The Pacific&#34; miniseries, well written and you really get the feeling of being there.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Floating in space.  My ship adrift.  I never should have listened to River and went outside.  Now look at me.  I have only one question:  When is Fox going to realize this series needs to start back up?  Okay...not gonna happen.  After all, it is Fox.  This series was way too good for them.<br /><br />If only I had watched it when it first aired...maybe I could have...yeah, right.  I didn't/don't have cable or satellite.  I've only recently upgraded my outdoor antenna...and now I do get Fox.  A little too late, but there it is.  Yeah, the series ends truncated...but the bounty hunter, Jubal Early...floating in space, was perfect.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a wonderful family Christmas gift that will yield many hours of educational entertainment.  We purchased this along with &#34;The Blue Planet&#34; and look forward to sharing some quality time with the whole family while we learn more about our Earthly home.  A great gift for a fair price.  Thank you Amazon.com.
1400069289|4.0|I am reviewing this book as part of the 12 Books group discussion which focuses on a business book each month.<br /><br /> The Power of Habit is a well written, logically organized and interesting book. Duhigg divides the book into three sections addressing habits of individuals, successful organizations and societies. Throughout the book he presents several relevant examples of the processes he puts forth on how habits develop and how they can be changed.<br /><br /> In Part One of the book the habits of individuals are addressed through the habit loop, the craving brain, and the golden rule of habit change. The habit loop addresses the three steps in the loop: The cue or trigger, the routine that individuals then fall into and the reward they receive at the end. The craving brain presents the process for creating new habits. The author uses Pepsodent and Febreze as examples of how companies were able to identify cues that changed the habits of individuals through having old habits replaced by new habits. The golden rule of habit change explains how transformation occurs and uses examples of Tony Dungy's coaching techniques and Alcoholics Anonymous. The author goes on to explain that there is no specific series of steps that are guaranteed to work as belief of the ability to change is a major factor.<br /><br /> Part Two of the book starts with the relevance of keystone habits - those habits that matter the most. Duhigg uses former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Michael Phelps as examples of how developing keystone habits will lead to successful outcomes. The next chapter revolves around Starbucks and the example of the development of automatic willpower creating a habit of success. The keystone habits important to the development of automatic willpower tie in nicely with an another book in the 12 Books group - Reviving Work Ethic. The author then discusses how a crisis can cause leaders to develop habits through accident and design. He uses a hospital in Providence, Rhode Island as the prime example in this chapter along with the London Underground. The final chapter addresses how companies can predict and manipulate habits. I found this chapter very interesting and could relate to many examples in my life where I can see companies trying to manipulate my buying habits.<br /><br /> Part three looks at the broader picture of the impact of habits in society. The author uses Rick Warren's Saddleback Church in California and the Montgomery bus boycott in the 1950's as examples of how movements development. The final chapter addresses the subject of whether or not we are responsible for our habits.<br /><br /> The Appendix takes the reader through a four step process to developing new habits. The steps are identifying the routine, experiment with the rewards, isolate the cue and have a plan. In addition the author has several additional resources available on the website: [...].<br /> I strongly recommend this book as it guides the reader through the development and changes in habits in an informative and interesting manner.the prime example in this chapter along with the London Underground.

B0076DELIG|5.0|Those of us who have been with him from the beginning appreciate the fact that the author has allowed Harry to age, to grow and mature.  He has become a thoughtful, well rounded human being -- a great character.  As always he advances his theory that either everyone matters or no one matters.  Good read!
B005NJU8PA|4.0|From my first listen to 4 Hour Workweek, Tim began to change my life. Suddenly my dreams about lifestyle enjoyment, efficiancy and leverage became vivid and doable, and I've been accelerating ever since.<br /><br />Now, with 4 Hour Chef, I'm diving into the scary, dark, dangerous room called cooking that I used to fumble around (with frequent mild injuries and much anxiety). While I've always been told when I try to cook, that I have some natural inclination to it, without knowing what I was really doing, I felt apprehensive.<br /><br />Now, my confidence is improving. I recently cooked my first Chili, threw out the microwave, and whip up eggs, French Toast and Pancakes for my kids with confidence and enjoyment. Next up: Osso \\"Buko\\" a la TF.<br /><br />From another proud Long Islander, I lift my glass to you Tim. Well done (haha, an unitentended pun, the best kind!).
B009VB97EY|3.0|Its a pretty bad movie,but its all worth suffering through it if you enjoy Channing Tatum and his dancing skills.
B008FOB124|4.0|Nothing new here folks except a solid reintroduction of DCD for folks who have been waiting for a LONG time to hear more.  The first track, Children of the Sun, seemed to get all the initial attention.  However, as I've played this album the two tracks that really stick out to me are Agape and Amnesia.  The first is Lisa Gerard at her middle-eastern best, while Amnesia plays to Brendan's melancholy singing style that had me hooked back from Aion days.  If you like this album and haven't really sampled DCD before, I highly recommend picking up copies of either Aion or Into the Labyrinth.
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|Its ok. Movie is one of the better step up movies, but I think they should definitely retire the movies and not make any more sequels
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|This movie stripped away almost all plot elements and left behind a string of boring action chase sequences in its place.  What little plot it did have was full of logic flaws.  I felt the only thing that would have made sense was for him to wake up at the end and realize it all really had been a dream.  Really disappointed.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Horrible, not worth my time or money.  I had such high hopes for the movie and it did not deliever.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Really brought the famous opera to life in an easy to understand and follow format!<br />I would recommend this movie!!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is my absolute favorite show and I watch the episodes over and over again. Highly Recommend to anyone looking for high quality comedy show. If you like the office or how I met your  mother I think you will really like this.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|I am not in to Coldplay, or actually I have to say \\"I wasn't\\". There are those rare bands that you just love everything they put out.  I also grew up in the 70's, so this band is a bit different.  I suspect if they were on American Idol they would get the boot.  But wouldn't Bob Dylan also??? LOL.<br /><br />There is something unique about his performances, and I LOVE particular songs, in part the last 6 songs on this DVD.  I also love a few now on this DVD, which IMHO makes me a Coldplay Fan.  THe fact I am on Amazon looking for more COldplay DVD's says something.  I have a huge DVD collection.  I have passed up many DVD's by artists I love because the damn video engineer either \\"Normally does hockey games\\", or \\"is on speed\\" and can't maintain a camera angle for more than 2 seconds.  And there are many runs of the camera changes where you get 1 sec and 7 camera's in 7 seconds!  THey just don't get it!!  We want it to be like we were there and had one<br />of the best seats in the house.  I would love to see more \\"Multi-angle\\" DVD's and let us direct the video!!  If I had to buy the DVD again however, I would.  But I am hoping I find some more Coldplay DVD's on Amazon where the video is not a speed freek Hockey engineer.  Sadly their most recent DVD that I had on pre-order turned out to be the same type of camera work.  Somehow I suspect these are video engineers that just don't understand that \\"Less is more\\".<br /><br />On the talent... Dylan is not the greatest singer. I mean, he could be in the greatest singer in the \\"I have 1 lung Category\\", but he is Dylan, unique. He has inspired so many bands in the 70's, 80's 90's and continues.  Chris Martin often singing above his key, and his movement style, plays multiple instruments, you can see he is so in to his work as an artist, he is a genius, there is no doubt.<br /><br />So if you are not a Coldplay fan, but like some of their songs, THIS IS THE DVD to buy.  If you really in to Coldplay, this is a must have as there are a lot of hits on there.  There is also 5 songs with multi-angle where you can pick the camera angle. Sadly<br />the 5 or so multi-angle songs are NOT the ones I love the most. This is about as honest a review I can give.  TO be 100% honest, I really only liked one or two of their songs.  I am now up to 8 that I really love.  I think over time as I take the time to listen to more, they are growing on me.. a lot.  There are some which I think for me will always be \\"Filler\\", but yea, this is worth buying.<br />Can't want for the concert.  Yep, I love music.  Worth going to a concert to see them play Yellow, Clocks, THe Scientist, Talk, Trouble , Viva la vida, Speed of sound...<br /><br />BTW, nothing shows more passion on this disk than Chris's almost \\"I am in my own universe\\" movements and total expression of when they play Yellow and The Scientist.  One can only imagine the endorphin rush he must be feeling at that time.  Awesome.
B007HO392S|4.0|Carrie Underwood is one of my fiance and I's favorite country female singers. She has delivered another great album that we have enjoyed over and over again. The only thing I can really say bad about her songs is that they get played over and over again on the local radio like most hit songs now days and makes it boring to listen to. Overall thought its a great CD and I think many Carrie Underwood fans and Country Fans alike will enjoy it.
141659521X|5.0|Typical Vince Flynn...keeps you on the edge of your seat and very good tactically.  Good gun stuff.  I can't wait until the next book comes out
B008QE9XD2|4.0|This movie could have been so much better. It has a good story line and it is funny in a dry way, several good one liners. But it gets slow in places and the special effects are not very good. I love Johnny Depp and agin he plays his part great. But the movie could have been so much better if Tim Burton had directed it.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|s mi hija le encanta se entretiene mucho con estes juego. lastima que sea tan dificil adquirir cualquier coward alli.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This movie was surprisingly good. It is British and I am from the south so I have to really pay attention to what they are saying. I have watched it 4 times now and I hear something new every time. Grandfather Santa is the cutest and his geriatric reindeer. Santa is a little slow but Mrs Santa keeps him on tract. It's has a very sweet ending and is left wide open for #2. I hope it's as good as #1.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I usually play solitaire on the computer and I enjoy playing the game on the Kindleeven though I have not used it that much yet
B005LAIISA|4.0|It has some funny parts but its not as funny as the other ice age movies. I think it's run it's corse.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I didn't realiz that you had to purchase an app in order to use the camera and it seem a little silly that basically you can only take pcictures of yourself or whoever is holding it
B005LAII62|5.0|I thought the story line was good but it's very dark and I think a little scary for young children. It's about a town a lot like Salem with a curse on it and the man that has kept the curse from happening for many years dies and Norman has to take over. The caricatures are well done, and comical I just don't think it's appropriate for small children.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I have been waiting for Fire availability and it's just as good in here as it is my phone. This is such a fun strategy game and it's constantly changing. It isn't free on here, but well worth the 99 cents.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|This was my favorite movie growing up and I'm glad I can now share it with the younger generation with the tech norm of their time. Definitely fun times to re-watch in 3D.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this all the time now. It is one of my favorite aps. The screen is large, making the numbers easy to see. The calculator is very easy to use. I love it.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|Like Rayman Origins on Wii.I didn't buy this this app but I think that it would be really similar 2 Raglan Origins.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Countless number of games. I would recommend. I would like to be able to change the tile graphics. Gets kinda boring seeing the same ones over & over.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The case fits perfectly, good pricing. Does It's job protecting it. Doesn't make it bulky & looks great. Haven't had any problems like some of the others did :)
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I'm only half way through the book but I'd already give it 5 stars. I made the Sexy Time Steak and my wife loved it. Also, learned a lot from the section on knife skills. Looked forward to the rest of the book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|AMAZING!!! I have no words to describe how I feel after reading this. Colleen Hoover had done it again! I think this is my Favorite. I started reading this last night and after a long day I was so tired but I couldn't put it down. I kept reading until my eyes could no longer stay open. Falling asleep think of the characters in this book then awakening only after 4 hrs asleep,I had to get back to this story right away. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Once again I am speechless and I will continue to think of this story for along time to come. Thank you Colleen Hoover for another Great Book!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I always enjoy hearing explanations of NDE from a medical perspective, like this one.  This author/doctor went through an amazing struggle and survived to tell the tale.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This CD is awesome. Every song is great. I can't stop playing it. Great music to keep the stress level low. My kids even enjoy it!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Classic feel good movie, you really become attached to the story's characters and find yourself cheering for the robot underdog. It ends so well that you almost wish for a sequel until you realize a sequel would only take away from how the movie ended.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Very easy to use and it helps me set timers for everything I need to be reminded of! Also love that I can use a song I downloaded for the alarm
B0056031VY|5.0|This was on my daughter's wish list for Christmas. The price and availability through Amazon is much appreciated. She loves this version of Mansfield Park and getting it in Blu-Ray is a bonus.
B0072PUC7W|5.0|Love the songs... got product very quickly ...no problems.. would use this source again in future.  Thanks for great product
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is a birthday gift for my grown son who is addicted to the Game of Thrones show. Was happy to be able to get it ordered ahead and know it will be here by the time his birthday comes. This was hard to find any where else.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm struggling to find the best word to describe Colleens writing abilities and how once again she manages to suck you in starting with the very first page. My world literally stopped until I finished this book, once I started reading I couldn't put it down until I finished. Such an emotional read and WOW I totally fell in love with these characters, what an amazing connection they have. Colleen please never stop writing.
B004XZR63M|5.0|For most people life consists of suffering through school, suffering through a job you hate and then eventually retiring too tired and too poor to do any of the things you've always wanted to do.<br /><br />I was headed this way myself...Till a friend suggested I read this book.  At first I was sceptical at best, and totally dismissive at worst....Until one night, bored at work, I found the copy I had been given in the bottom of my bag.  I started to read it and only because I'm stubborn did I read past the first few pages.  At first all I could see was some rich guy rubbing my nose in the fact that he had heaps of money an time on his hands and plenty of it to waste on writing a book....I told my friend this and he laughed saying that many people think this at first.<br /><br />That was when he introduced me to the game CASHFLOW (based on this books lessons and information and also made by the same guy who wrote the book.  After playing the game for only a few minutes, suddenly some of the stuff I had read in the book started to make sense.  It couldn't be that simple could it?  Some guys book and a game can teach you the lessons you need to let go of the old way of doing things and not only free yourself from the endless wheel of work to pay the bills but make you money start to work for you the way it should!?!?  When I asked this same questions of my friend, he just smiled and said,&#34;Now read the book again&#34;.<br /><br />Over the next month, I went back through the book, taking notes and highlighting parts I wanted to explore more.  I did a lot of research (and then got this book on Kindle so I can reference stuff easily)...We've since passed that old copy of the book onto several other people and whilst all of us are still working, our mindsets have changed and we are all making serious inroads into getting OUT of the rat-race.<br /><br />Thankyou Robert Kiyosaki, you have changed our lives.  I cannot stress enough how much this book is worth.  Highly recommend it to anyone sick of &#34;working for the man&#34; and getting nowhere fast but always feeling tired.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I actually DO like this game.  The only reason one star is off, is because the people are weird looking.  If maybe they made it look a lil bit better, this would be five star.  But, I like it way better than the other ones!  The 3D effects are well done, and so our the other things.  I like this game, and it deserved my money!
B003JRD5JO|5.0|Takes me back to when I was younger.  I have always loved this album.  Great deal on it and couldn't pass it up.
1596434252|5.0|is the better gift for my girl, i´m so happy because it´s a beautiful book and everything is so cool.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|This book was easy to read although sometimes depressing.  It has me rooting for the murderer to be caught the whole way through while still showing what loss does to a family.
0547884591|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I thought Tim was way over his head.  A book on not only learning, but becoming world-class in any skill in six months or less?  After reading through the book and cooking my first major meal with delight, however, I am now a true believer.<br /><br />As alluded to in the subtitle of the book, this book is not simply about cooking.  It's about breaking down our prejudices and assumptions about what we can or can't achieve.  The common assumption about learning is that it not only takes a lot of time to become good at something, but it requires lots of hard work.  Tim Ferriss shows us, however, that 80% of the results that we want to produce from performing a skill come from 20% of the work we actually put into performing it.  The real challenge with learning is simply figuring out what that 20% is.<br /><br />In his usually, ADHD manner, Tim provides us, in the first part of the book, concrete (and humorous) examples of different skill sets we can master while breaking down the process of effective learning, all the while directing us in a \\"Choose Your Adventure\\" format that allows us to jump around to different subjects that we might be interested in.<br /><br />In the second part of the book, Tim packs six months of culinary education into fourteen simple, yet elegant meals (with actual prep time being 5 to 20 min) that represent the 20% of the culinary arts.  In addition, Tim provides us with countless other recipes and side-topics, from hunting and cooking in the wild, to dessert, to how to shoot a three-pointer in basketball.<br /><br />My only criticism of this 670 page mammoth of a book is that I wish there was more.  A truly great read, one that you can and should return to over and over and over again.
B008NW67E0|5.0|i would recommend this cd to anyone who is a mumford and sons fan. definitely enjoyed it, especially the cover of the boxer.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is just brilliant. I was nervous to start reading this book because I loved Slammed and POR and didn't think she could top herself, but I was wrong. So different, but so beautifully written and original. I loved it!
B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie is a standard now, everyone should watch it.  Interesting weave of real history and Forrest's life.  Tom Hanks is especially wonderful here.
B007SGM084|5.0|I wasn't sure about reading these books. Everyone was talking about them like they were incredibly shocking or something. I enjoyed them. Some of the intimate scenes aren't for those who are uncomfortable with anything out of the ordinary, but they are all well written. There is also a good plot and the story is more important by the second and third book.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|i love this simple, poetic record.  An Awesome Wave won England's Mercury prize for a very good reason - in a year of OUTSTANDING musical efforts - this is really the best of the best.  Give it a chance - it might take 3-4 listens before you agree - but agree I predict you shall...
B004PGAQMW|5.0|Great kids movie with a great soundtrack. My girls which it all the time and it doesn't drive me crazy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of THE best Indie releases from 2012! Thank you Colleen for gifting us with another brilliant book.<br /><br />Once again Colleen Hoover has left up standing under a puddle of tears. I'm not even ashamed of the fact that some folks saw me ugly crying while reading this book. I was so swept away by the devestatingly beautiful story that is Hopeless. Hopeless is about so many things like love, friendship, family, betrayal, survival, regrets, forgiveness, courage, and last but not least, hope. It was beautiful, heart-wrenching, devestating, and inspiring. It was everything I wanted from a Colleen Hoover novel and so much more!<br /><br />I absolutely cannot wait till Hopeless comes out on paperback. Hopeless will be going right up on my top favorites shelf sitting right next to Colleen's other wonderful books, Slammed and Point of Retreat. I know I say this about a lot of books that I read but if there is one book you need to read, it would have to be Hopeless. You'll be amazed by how much Sky and Holder affect you and how much you learn about friendship, love, courage, and hope from these two young and beautiful characters. Colleen Hoover just has a way with her words that will engrain themselves in your hearts and your minds and will stay with you forever. I can't say any more about this book except for you must read it!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Brave is very well done and the storyline is perfect.  Although Pixar doesn't do these types of movies that often it is very well done!
B007TUAHVQ|1.0|We bought this very expensive set at Walmart after I swore I would never buy Halo products again for my son.  The kit is missing pieces and one piece is broken.  The Halo directions leave much to be desired when compared to Lego and the pieces do not fit together without using adult strength or pliers.  Beware of these sets as they are likely to leave your child frustrated and angry!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|All in all - a great book, the method of writing from a point of view of a person and cycling through all the character makes it a bit hard to follow (espessially for those with ADHD :)  )<br />Very hard to put down after starting to read it, now starting the next one !
B003O86FMW|2.0|It was good and i recommend it to those looking to read a thrilling novel! it is worth to buy!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I could not stop reading - constant action, gory but insightful to human nature in such a different world.  Great Fantasy, super and easy reading.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Totally different from Season 1, but just as good.  I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys horror with a twist...special appearance from Adam Levine was really unexpected and entertaining. Also, the acting from Jessica Lange reminds you of why she received an Emmy for Season 1.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I spent a month in India, and yes, India is infectious.  I read Shantaram after trekking Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan  for month and reading this book took me right into Delhi and Varanasi inner town(s) - the slums, where I stayed at the cheap hotels and touched the every day life of Hindu people.  It is an amazing country, society, democracy, corruption and all that is so incredibly portrayed in this book.  I highly recommend even if you never went to India and never plan to go there.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This program doesn't work with Kindle Fire HD. I thought it would be a good app addition  but, no luck.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book reads like an absolute chaos...so many characters and it is hard to make connections between them.....I read 16% of the book and know only that the guy dropped dead and different people have different feelings about his death and different expectations from his death...so what?<br /><br />Boring and confusing
B0076DELIG|5.0|My favorite author, ever!  I always love his books.  Fast paced, Harry is always present and he doesn't go off in a tangent on some other character or scene in which I'm not interested.  I think that is the key on why Michael Connely's books are so good.  I am a little concerned that Harry is getting old, though.  I want him to go on forever.  For me he is the perfect cop.  Not perfect, not necessarily one that I would want to stop me for a traffic violation, although very honest, I believe he would do anything for a victim, even bending the rules.  The Black Box is another top notch book by Connelly.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It definitely is an easy read.  Kept my interest.  Good banter!!<br />I do want to read the rest of the trilogy.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I love that I can organize & choose where files go now. My main reason for dowloading this was so that I could get a flash player on my Kindle Fire Hd, so that I could watch tv & certain videos that require it. Works great!
B00A31UXLW|3.0|I have read all of Michael Connelly's books but have been disappointed with the last couple he has produced. He has always been one of my favourite authors but the standard of this book is not the same as his earlier fabulous works such as 'The Poet&#34; and &#34; Concrete Blonde&#34; for example. The characters did not have as much depth as in previous novels and I found it hard to get attached to them, I also found the story itself was not as gripping as in earlier books he has written.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I got this app for my kindle fire hd. It works great and I've had no problems with it. Recommended.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I have rated this only 3 stars because I don't want an egg and I cant throw it away. I have an egg waiting and I want to go for an elf dragon and I cant because I have to wait for this stupid other dragon egg that I really don't want. I think that they should make that an option because I'm not wasting my gold bars on a stupid egg I don't want. That is why I only rated it 3 stars.<br /><br />p.s: 3 stars was a generous contrubution
B008XG1X18|5.0|Got this app for the Kindle Fire Hd. Works great. Love this app/site. No problems to report. Would recommend. .
B005SDB6RK|5.0|Sick. The footage and the music work very well together. We get an inside look into Travis Rice's mind and work. You will watch this over and over and over again for years to come.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I got this app free for the Kindle Fire HD. I absolutely love it! Works great. Crisp, clear tiles. You can choose different boards & it automatically reshuffles the board if you run out of available matching tiles, which I love. Other mahjong games would just end the board when this happened! This is a good one!
B002LFAHBO|5.0|One of the best movies ever - we watch it over and over again, especially at the holidays! So glad I have it on Blu-Ray now!
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome app I can play this app all day I wanted the Pc versoion but its awesome but its great.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I bought this series on here for two reasons - the price and plus it's just a dang good tv show to own!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I was disappointed in this book.  John Grisham has written some amazing page turners.  This is not one of them.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|cant put it down! this is by far the best book ive read in a while! you must read it!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|The movie was great till the end. hate how it ended but the movie up until then was great. Worth watching.
B00957T6X6|4.0|I started reading the series after seeing some episodes of the first season. It is very bloody, so if you don't care for slice'em & dice 'em adventures then this isn't for you. The many twists and turns suffered by the Stark family are a continual surprise. The varied seasons and landscapes are intriguing as well as the vast array of characters. Very few of the villians are completely bad and none of the heroes or heroines are completely good making it a believable story. I am eager to read the next installment of the series.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|My Kindle is very secure with this case and I like stand.  It makes the kindle alttle heavier which that doesn't bother me.  I like the security of the unit.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|\\"It is what it is,\\" which is amazingly addictive, and arguably at its funnest form on the Kindle Fire. No real advertisement problems like I've had to endure on my girlfriend's Driod and it's pretty seemless. I'm definitely not breaking any ground here, but there's my two scents. It's still enormous amounts of fun laying waste to all the pigs I can before bed or what have you.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I have a friend that loves the Bourne novels and films.  He thought this film was horrible, that it just didn't measure up to the other Bourne films.  I didn't read the novels, and I barely remember the films.  I remember I loved the first film, but the second and third weren't that great to me.  All I really remember about those two films is that I couldn't stand the shaky cam action scenes.<br /><br />This film does away with the disorienting use of the shaky cam.  It's there but not in a really noticeable way.  The best thing the film had going for it were the action scenes.  They were creative and engaging.  As for the plot, its a typical cat and mouse plot, but I still liked it.  I had very low expectations going into the film because I didn't like the previous two Bourne films, and this one exceeded my expectations.
B006YXTRHY|1.0|I just don't get the infatuation everyone has with this movie. The actors are lousy, the special effects cheesy, and the story poorly told. To be fair, the book was not my favorite either but this movie took it to a new low.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|pretty crazy story...the cast was pretty awesome, good to see Riggs from FNL back haha<br /><br />scenery was great too for CA
B00005JMXX|5.0|This movie make you think about how we are treating this planet.  The consequences of your actions can make mother Earth say it time to clean house,  Green house effect is real and this movie hit home about that.  The acting, story line was very good an the actor all my favorites.  I had to have this for my collection.
160774273X|5.0|I found the Forkish \\"Flour Water Salt Yeast\\" whilst browsing through Amazon books.  Both my husband(retired chef of 50 years) sounds an awful long time, but whatever,we are still active, with many hobbies - back up,and I- LOVE BREAD.  When I saw the cover of this book just had to order it and just see.  Ken Forkish has produced a wonderful, accurate, foolproof book of the most wonderful recipes, for those who really LOVE BREAD. Mind you, there are no short-cuts, one has to stay precisely to the recipe.<br />My German husband is slowly working his way through the whole book and highly recommends to all.

B009GEAPYW|4.0|There were a few parts of this that were slow for me. Batman is old in this one but still kicks a lot of butt.
1419702203|5.0|A beautiful book and a great addition to any Beatles or George Harrison library.  Mostly unseen photos and stories from the family make it even more special.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I only rented this because I want to learn to use a bow and arrow. This movie will definitely get you excited about picking up the sport.
0739337270|5.0|I bought this as a audio book, and with all the Christmas music and activites, I have been battling my guilt over listening to it over the other.<br />This is so captivating and if no one is with me in my vehicle, it is on full time.  This is a wonderful story, and unfortunately, so realistic that it breaks my heart.<br />If young people today (especially, but not only) could get a little slice of heart and story of the history of our world, they would never feel they have problems like those of the people in this time.<br />The thing I absolutely loved about this book is that it is from an insiders look of being German, surrounded by Nazi when they don't have the evil in their hearts, so they live in constant persecution, loss of work and possible death if they show they are sympathizers for Jewish Germans-but they do anyway.<br />The reader of this book is amazing and I feel so blessed that this book jumped in front of me to read!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I love the show Castle - so for fun I googled Rick Castle I had no idea that the books are real - I will not stop till I read them all - BEST SHOW -BEST BOOKS - GOOD FUN!!!!
B0032O6S4I|5.0|This zoo is quite detailed. My daughter (20 months) loves all of the animals. We put away the MANY detailed small pieces until she is bigger and can handle them safely, but the rest of the zoo is amazing! There are also so many options to add on. We LOVE Playmobil.
B001383XT8|5.0|It does exactly what i expected it to do.for the price its of good quality.was a gift for my son and he has no complaints.
0385342039|5.0|I got this book to meet my shipping minimum and didnt expect anything but I will now buy a bunch of other books by this author. It was light hearted, entertaining and kept me hooked. I loved the characters and story line and strongly recommend it!

B0074MZSWW|4.0|Awesome album by a great group of musicians.  I love the way this all blends together.  Really looking forward to seeing what come next from these guys!
B007EE564U|5.0|There are few authors that can match Vince Flynn's pace and intensity. His books are the kind you read in one sitting. The Last Man was not quite as good as the previous two books, American Assassin and Kill Shot but it is still a great deal better than what the other writers out there deliver. If you are a Mitch Rapp fan, then you will obviously want to read this book. If you are not yet a fan, this book will still be a good read, although I recommend going back and reading the series in order.
9889979942|5.0|China: Portrait of a People is a magnificent look inside a nation most Westerners know little about, and it accomplishes this in the most delightful way--through photographs. These are not your generic, Internet-type photographs. Rather, these are personal, one-of-a-kind, unique peeks inside the soul of China.<br /><br />In the Year of the Monkey, 2004, Tom Carter left San Francisco to embark on a four-year quest to connect with the Chinese. From the southwestern subtropical jungle, to the frozen wastes of Siberia, across deserts, and beneath Hong Kong's neon blur, he tramped through China by train, bus, boat, motorcycle, mule, and on foot.<br /><br />What he discovered was that China is not one people; but rather, it has 33 regions and is made up of 56 distinct ethnic backgrounds, each with its own unique personality. These cultures come through in over 600 color photographs. You'll discover the face of a farmer harvesting green tea, an Akha woman with burgundy-stained teeth from chewing the narcotic beetle nut, babies and goats riding in bicycle baskets, lovers kissing in the park, and hipsters with bleached hair and piercings. You'll look into the eyes of the elderly, joyful children, families, and business people.<br /><br />One day, Tom Carter found himself freezing half to death. He was unprepared for the bitter cold in Northern China, the Siberian region, in winter. As he sat on the bus, his entire body was in complete and utter pain; and he couldn't stop shaking. Two elderly Chinese woman came alongside him, covered him with their Army blankets, and warmed him inside this \\"tent\\" with their own body heat. It was an incredible act of kindness from strangers who communicated on a deeper level than words.<br /><br />One cannot fully understand a people without seeing the dwellings in which they live. You'll discover homes so close together, you can barely see space between the rooftops as well as simple thatched-roof village homes.<br /><br />If I had to select one photograph as a favorite, I'd have to say it's the one that shows women along the banks of the Yalu River doing their morning wash by hand; right behind them stands a long row of modern high-rise buildings. It's such a contrast. How is it that women are scrubbing laundry in a river in front of tall structures with high-tech amenities?<br /><br />The book is organized according to the 33 regions the author visited. There's a map, short explanation, and captions to go with the outstanding photographs. Highly recommended for hours of viewing pleasure and insight into the mysteries of China. This book is perfect as a gift or for your own library or coffee table.one photograph as a favorite, I'd have to say it's the one that shows women along the banks of the Yalu River doing their morning wash by hand; right behind them stands a long row of modern high-rise buildings.

B0031RS2HC|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. Jack Reacher has a no-nonsense direct approach to tackling the bad guys. I enjoy readers such as Vince Flynn and Brad Taylor, and Lee Child belongs in their company.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Good for time wasting.  Needs better instructions though.  I like the graphics for a free game.  I wish it were better at letting a person play without needing a lot of money spent.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|My grandmother and I really love this CD, however she lost our copy a couple of months ago.  So, I got this one a a Christmas present for her.  I'm sure she'll be happy with it.

0307352145|4.0|This is a well-written and well-researched popular nonfiction book that I found hard to put down. A minor qiuibble -- Cain says that people are complex and that there isn't just one type of introvert. This is surely correct. However, throughout much of the book, she contrasts people who fit what one might think of as the sterotypical introvert personality profile with the rests of folks, whom she characterizes as extroverts. I am happy to say that this problem turns out to be a quibble and not a flaw as she point of the book is to explain the biological basis of introverion, and to then examines introversion through the prism of social, economic, and cultural expectations.
0446554995|5.0|A new Pendergast novel is always a treat!<br />I've enjoyed quite a few of the stand-alone books, but nothing compares to Pendergast.<br />The book wraps up the Helen trilogy in a way I found highly satisfactory, while creating a new direction for Pendergast to go.<br /><br />I finished this (in two nights) and already I can't wait for the next entry in the series!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love this series. However, I'm too cheap to do the pay per view thing. I don't watch much HBO or Showtime so I won't be able to catch the second season until it is available on Amazon or some other pay per season distributor.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|A good King novel; not on par with some of his better works (IMHO) such as some of the Dark Tower books or The Stand.  The premise of the novel was a good one, and well executed.  Characterization for some of the secondary characters wasn't quite as in depth as it could have been.  I would give it five stars, but the ending seemed a little flat.  The plot was moving right along, and then just kind of stopped.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I had been looking for an ap that would allow me to utilize my Kindle Fire without Wifi access. It allows me to download videos from YouTube for viewing when out of Wifi range!

B0031YJFCQ|1.0|Of the three books  about The Girl Who......  this is the dullest.The story is embedded in tedious descriptions of the Swedish secret service and other local institutions. I was glad to finally reach the end.  This despite the fact that  I like the principal very original character . Unfortunately she was mostly incarcerated and the story  focused on the institutions  and people surrounding her.
1439196834|5.0|This book is exactly as advertized- made a great birthday present for my boyfriend. A very fun read and supplied lots of laughs.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|Having trouble figuring out how to delete unwanted items but like having a rating system for items maybe once I store more materials I will find it more handy.

B001HC8516|3.0|I bought he's just not that into you but I really didn't need to if you've ever seen him on television you get it. He's just not that into you. You don't really need a whole book for that just remember the title that will answer a lot of those nagging questions running around in your head about someone you're dating who's acting a little strange. Why is this person treating you weird. Why my darling it's simple<br />(He's Just Not That Into You)<br /> I bought this along with  [[ASIN:B0071AS0M2 Dating]] another book called Dating by Gloria Jean.<br />I think it's a good thing to know if he's really not that into you. Sometimes you just don't get the obvious.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|Loved this movie as a kid and still enjoy it as an adult. The picture and sound quality on this Blu Ray were awesome! Really nice extras too.
B006H5120E|5.0|very good picture, the sound is a little weak, but with a surround sound connect to the tv, it should be good

B00AJRQLTI|3.0|only because the MP3 version was $5.00. I was not going to buy it at all until they release the full recording. There are quite a few songs missing especially \\"Little Fall of Rain\\"
B00AMBH70S|1.0|This thing is in search of more than a director; it needs a story line. An ending would help too.

B0014D6PCO|5.0|Great movie! So much better than the previous movies from the 90's! See all the 3 new ones!! You must see!
B004MPESSY|3.0|I have now watched both the original as well as the remake.  In my opinion the remake is noth as intense as the original. If you really wanna feel some sense of disguist check out the original and save the 2010 version for somebody else.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|This product is very overpriced for what is included.  I guess it is the mindcraft name.  If it had not been for my grandson I would not have purchased.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|This was a blast for my grandson and myself to do each morning before the bus came as a count down to Christmas.  It only takes a coupleof minutes to complete each task. The plus was the almost 8 year old was able to read the instructions for each day.  (No candy involved was a great plus also.)  Wonderful project for all ages!!

B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is one of the all time great Christmas movies. We make a point to watch it every year. This version is awesome because it has the original black & white as well as the colorized version (which I have never seen).  It is a wonderful movie for all ages & one you can watch every year.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|Bigger Leaner Stronger is a great read to learn about overall fitness and what anyone can do to get in to great shape in a healthy (no fad diet) way.  In addition, I had several questions after reading the book and emailed Mike Matthews, he responded quickly and clarified the areas I had questions on.<br /><br />I've been following the strength plan outlined in the book for two weeks and I am already seeing results!  A great book with sound logical advice.

0670026182|5.0|The title was so catchy...I HAD to try it for myself, and I am THRILLED I did. Like another customer said...food porn? I would not go THAT far, but this book is UNIQUE in it's STYLE, it's PHOTOGRAPHY, it's RECIPES, and it's WORDING. I love the introduction by Katie Quinn Dunns. She is  REAL, and humorous. One thing I may caution...I would not buy or recommend for the beginner!  And that is perfectly okay! I always tell everyone, you need to learn the basics before you start on the harder recipes,- and there are PLENTY of those books available! I LOVE how Katie took each recipe as it was the most IMPORTANT THING TO HER, and showed us in photos, and in the writing of the recipes themselves. This is the most unique Cookbook I have to date, and I will covet it and ENJOY EVERY minute reading, cooking and sharing my love of cooking with others. THANK YOU KATIE QUINN DAVIS for the LOVE you put into every page! IRELAND should be proud of 'THEIR' girl Katie!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A masterpiece by Colleen Hoover!! This book took my breathe away. It was an emotional roller coaster that left you drained after reading it. I LOVED IT!! She draws you in.. Takes you up and down, this way and that way.. Ways that I didn't even see coming.. It is what you want when you read a book. She has it down to a science.. She writes it in a way that you become Sky and feel and go through everything that Sky does.. Just AWESOME!! READ IT!!!
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|The first couple time that I did this it didn't work. The real trick is the temp of the water after u put the cut in the glass.. I had a large pot full of ice cold water, and another one with hot/boiling water- the better contrast between the temps of the waters will increase your chances of a perfect cut!

B0065AR71E|4.0|The book is very well made and has sturdy construction. It gives much information that might not have been found or understood as I do not have much time to devote to gaming. I was pleased with the information and graphics. Very helpful
B0000C8AW7|5.0|Bob Dylan is amazing to me. This is unlike any other album of his I have heard. It's like he has mixed his origins with all the styles he has incorporated into his music over the last 40 years. It's enjoyable...makes me laugh in some places as his lyrics are creative and, well, surprising in some songs. Heartfelt. Soulsy (if that's a word). Bluesy...AWESOME!! :)

B0052RDHTM|4.0|This book tells the stories of all of the countries involved in World War 1. Mr Follett tells us what effect it had on not only Americans, but British, German, Russian, Austrian families. How their governments reacted to one another and how all of these people were inter-related. Just imagine your country being at war with your closest cousin's country.<br />How people who grew up together actually had to fight each other. I am ready to read book 2 to see what happens to them all.
B005LAII62|5.0|My family loved this movie! We saw it originally in the movies and after it was over, my youngest asked, &#34;Can we see it again?&#34; Highly recommended! :)
B00005JMFQ|4.0|the movie is one of my all time favs! but while watching the movie there were 2 or 3 skips in the film.....no idea if that was the dvd itself or our old dvd player, but it wasn't so bad that we had to stop watching it.

B00AJRQLTI|2.0|I don't understand why the most touching song \\"Do you hear the people sing\\" (original french song: a la volonte du peuple) is not included in this CD. Very disappointing. very very sad. So sad that the collection is not the best... much worse than I expected.

1451638450|5.0|The usual high rating for books in this series for me. I've followed the series from the beginning and this is a very good addition. Clever development of a character who has been a minor supporting character throughout the series mostly distinguished by the phrase \\"Ivan, you idiot\\" to a mature, well rounded individual with surprising depth.
0399226907|5.0|Everyone needs to have this book in a children's library. The artwork is beautiful and the story is a good read at any young age, and not too long
B0036EH3XE|2.0|I loved seasons 1-5. I even enjoyed the first two part episode of season 6. However as season 6 dragged on, the episodes lacked the tenderness and emotional drama that made Lost so popular amongst its fans. In addition, the intrigue and fascinating mysteries of the Island were either sped along and thrown into the audiences face with what seemed like no passion, that it just left a bad taste in how the show was handled.<br /><br />I got the sense that any criticism that could be deemed legit toward the writing and handling of the last season would be merely put in \\"you can't please everybody\\" bin. While that may be true, I believe the ratings and reviews this season gets as demonstration that this final season was a big let down for many Lost fans.<br /><br />Oddly, I would still recommend this show. Lost was one of the greatest shows at character development and creating emotional stories, but the show faltered when it created this huge mythological backdrop for the characters to add suspense and mystery to the show, only to fall flat with many fans in the final season when the characters have been developed, and they had to go through the motions of doing their best to answer certain mysteries.<br /><br />3 episodes standout for their dramatic appeal and demonstration of why I loved lost; LA X Part 1 & 2, Ab Aeterno, and Happily Ever After. Ab Aeterno was probably my favorite episode of the season because it not only had a compelling story to tell for an important character on the show, but it incorporated revelations about mythological mysteries of the show as well.<br /><br />Seasons 1-2 are by far the best. Season 3-5 are great seasons as well. So despite my disappointment of season 6, the previous seasons make this show well worth the watch.<br /><br />I gave this season 2 stars because it felt rushed, many episodes had characters traipsing through the jungle with no dramatic effect, and many episodes seemed to lack creative passion when dealing with the revelations of the Island.
0446554995|4.0|After reading Preston and Child's latest Agent Pendergast novel, \\"Two Graves\\", I was surprised by the dichotomy among reviewers.  True, this novel is a mixed bag but, all in all, it is a fun Pendergast adventure which depicts him in a totally new manner at times--indeed, emotionally crippled, keeps the pages turning for the reader, and introduces new elements into Pendergast's life that will have significant future ramifications.  But mostly, \\"Two Graves\\" answers a lot of questions from past novels, ties up a lot of loose threads, completes the trilogy regarding his wife, Helen, and the Esterhazy family, and thusly, clears the decks for new directions and new focuses in future novels.<br /><br />The novel picks up where \\"Cold Vengeance\\" ended with Pendergast and his thought-to-be-dead wife Helen briefly reuniting...but she is quickly kidnapped and whisked away as Agent Pendergast mounts a furious and resourceful effort to track her down and save her.  The results of this tragic episode have devastating effects on Pendergast's ability to persevere.  He quickly alienates all around him, including his buddy, Lieutenant D'Agosto who wants him to get involved in a case featuring a NYC hotel serial killer who is so skilled, so physically adept, and so formidible that even Pendergast becomes flummoxed.<br /><br />The narrative ultimately leads Pendergast to a secret enclave in South America where a decades-old conspiracy awaits him to finish him once and for all.  This evil conspiracy from Pendergast's and Helen's past serves to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the three novels that fans are calling the \\"Helen Trilogy\\". Indeed, Pendergast is forced to face the evil conspiracy and two people within it who are forever linked to his and Helen's past and future.<br /><br />Gothically atmospheric at times, horrifyingly modern at times, and grotesquely reaching into the past at other times, \\"Two Graves\\" in many ways, ends Pendergast's past story while redefining itin new shocking ways. There are two subplots woven into this novel that seem relatively superfluous, particularly the thread dealing with Corrie and her search into her background and a resulting mystery (BTW, when did Corrie emerge as a \\"regular\\" in this series?).  The sub plot surrounding Constance Greene is also unnecessary to the main thrust of the novel but it does provide for explanations of her mysterious past that also help to wrap up loose threads and answer questions within the totality of the Pendergast novels.<br /><br />\\"Two Graves\\" is like most novels in that it has its highs and lows.  Pendergast remains a great character in contemporary thriller fiction and his adventures almost always entertain and provoke emotions within his readership.  This novel does attempt to complete a trilogy, does bring new light onto Pendergast's character, and does end a number of continuing threads, while developing a whole new direction for his future.  For those reasons alone, this book should appeal to any loyal longtime Pendergast reader.
B009OA57MI|3.0|This is an awesome game on my galaxy s..the new update has some1 talking has great new graphics & everything but my kindle is still on the old version..pleez update 4 the kindle & while ur at it add an f-16 & f-15....sincerest REPEAT CUSTOMER
B00555X8OA|3.0|Evidently I am a slow thinker! This book was WAY over my head! I have to read each page twice. BUT if you take the time to read it all, it does make sense.
0375851569|5.0|I bought this collection for our grandson.  These are the books I used to teach our children how to read before kindergarden.  The rhyming helps and it is great for learning site words.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|My 2 year old daughter really enjoys this movie, she especially is fascinated with alligators and crocodiles at the moment.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good app for solitare. Doesn't force close graphics are great. You should be able to use your own pictures as backgrounds and card backs.
B000NJMJGG|5.0|I love this movie. I loved this movie as a kid and I still love it. Now I get to share it with my little one :)
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I loved this version of Wuthering Heights, the acting is great and it's as close to the novel as you can get.  Not to mention the haunting music score and scenery.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants to be swept away into a classic love story.

B008EEBBIY|5.0|I feel in love the song Hero, then I got the entire digital album and I listen to it during my workout, very cool music.<br />Great Vids too.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I'm 22 years old and I downloaded this because I enjoy cute games with animals, and Gameloft hasn't steered me wrong yet. LPS is a simple game of animal care and home building that lets you choose from a multitude of adorable pets to create a pet town paradise. Unfortunately, you need a certain number of pets to progress, and it's incredibly easy to hit a button to spend real-money currency by accident. Most items cost bling, the gem-like currency you need to spend real money to accumulate.<br />A note to parents: make sure to enable password protection for money purchases in apps, or you may end up with several hundred dollars in charges. I'm not exaggerating; some items cost over a hundred by themselves.<br />Overall a fun app, but one you need to be wary of if you're downloading it for a child.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|Great watch, nice to add to my Collection, I love all Invicta watches, this one is great quality and the blue stands out
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I'm a brony (or pegasister technically)  so naturally a free pony app for my kindle was pretty appealing. The opening story, complete with original voice cast, had me colored impressed. I loved the initial building, mini games, and pony introductions. I really felt like I was rebuilding Ponyville to unlock the Elements of Harmony.<br /><br />But then I looked at the shop. I'm level 27 after several weeks of daily grinding, but I can't really progress because everything is just too expensive. Part of unlocking the elements of harmony is welcoming back the ponies who represent them. Unfortunately, a couple of the mane six that you absolutely need to progress in the game cost real money, and no, it is not avoidable. To build up the amount of gems you need to purchase Rarity, Rainbow Dash or Fluttershy without spending real money, you'd probably be at it for a couple of years at least and that is not an exaggeration.<br /><br />The mini games get really old really fast, especially when the apple game decides to throw nothing but rotten apples at you, which can be devastating if you spent gems for a point boost. Bits (the standard currency) do not accumulate quickly, and when it costs 8000 bits to clear a rock, it's easy to become frustrated.<br /><br />Overall this game seems like it was meant for bronies with how much things cost, but with gameplay too simplistic for a ten year old. Hopefully future updates will bring less extravagant prices, but until then this game loses its appeal after about a week.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Took a while to get into the book but once I did it could not be put down.  More twists and turns and all unexpected.  Loved the book.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|The premise is unique and the characters intriguing.  Although there is a long term, underlying plot development (Red John), I like that not every episode attempts to advance the underlying plot.  I also like that the romantic entanglements of the two main characters is kept to a minimum and unintrusive.  Simon Baker is great in this role.  He is flawed, not perfect but a really good guy.  He is not intimidated by wealth and we chuckle when he takes the obnoxious, arrogant (often wealthy), and just plain wicked down a peg.<br /><br />Best series on prime time in a very, very long time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow free is very entertaining and alot of fun to do with your grandkids.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|I like Maroon  5..not there best, but a lot of catchy tunes. I like change  in my music  so don't  mind when a band diverts from their normal  format.

I bought this for him for his birthday and he adores it.<br />The sound quality is amazing<br />The battery life is fantastic<br />It's remarkably comfortable<br />Excellent Sound-Cancelling Capabilities<br /><br />We have two small kids at home so our house is occasionally noisy. All he has to do to mute is flip up the microphone.<br /><br />Overall... this thing is great. I highly recommend it.
B008476HBM|5.0|There's not much new to say about Jane Austen though in my experience readers of classic novels either love her or hate her.  When I was younger I found her books to be too sugary for my taste but now I find her work to be very enjoyable.  Perhaps it comes with age :-).  It's a great love story to read on a stormy night in front of the fire.  Wonderful character development.  If one prefers more angst I'd recommend something like Rememberance of Things Past :-).
B008LV05EG|5.0|Every person that says Rita is the new Rihanna hasnt heard this album. Rita's sound is completely different. New, fresh, sexy and happy. One of the best albums released this year. Totaly worth it!!!

B009HV2JT8|3.0|A good action movie. Not much more, I liked the concept but the plot is noting that great. I would still recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed all the books. Quick read. Easy to get into. Fun story line. Passed all the books to my little sister.
2245267346|5.0|This is an extraordinary book to appreciate life, to remember that the great things comes in small packages. To open our hearts at every moment during life.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|First, I am the typical show choir/a Capella geek.  I love the songs and mash-ups, the only thing that would have made this soundtrack better would have been if they would have done full length or longer versions of the &#34;Bella's&#34; Songs and not so many of the treblemakers.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|This was a feel-good SciF love story, and those are rare.  FREE WILL -- mankind was given it and proved again and again we were not mature enough to be left on our own, we still needed babysitters to keep us out of trouble.  Based on the state our world is now in, I found this concept  believable and also a bit comforting.<br />The story was light hearted and easy to follow, not slow to get started, just fast paced enough to not bog down, yet not feel rushed, it was a relaxing science fiction movie - again a rare quality for this genre.  Simple but effective special affects and concepts.  Enough character development to care what happens to most of them.<br />What I most enjoyed was the chemistry between the two lead actors, which I give credit to good writing & good acting.  But I very much got a sense the two actors very likely developed a platonic friendship while filming.  The chemistry felt that real, with their witty banter and how they instantly clicked.  We've all had that happen in our lives, usually that person ends up being a long standing close friend, and if we're lucky, they end up our lover, our partner as well.<br />I've only written a few reviews and I know it is not my strength, however, I felt compelled to write one for this movie, as I really want people to not pass this movie over, to give it a try and I am confident none will regret they did.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|It had the action of the Bourne movies, but the romantic part seemed to dilute it a little.  This one was a disappointment compared to the others.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|i love this season the first season with my favorite doctor matt smith. this was the season that got me hooked on Who. :)
B008PALH0E|5.0|With a excellant line-up of soloists, a massive chorus of over 1,000 and two combined orchestras, this will knock you out of your seat!  And the chorus, including a huge children's chorus singing from memory, stands for the full 90 minutes. The excitement is visceral, as one wonders if this huge performance might come off its wheels, but Dudamel seems to be channeling Mahler himself, and delivers a performance of a lifetime.  Oh to have been there!<br />The added feature is very nice, showing how the two orchestras worked together, like two families sharing one daddy, since Dudamel conducts both the LA Philharmonic and the Orchestra of Venezuela.
0316069434|2.0|This is heavy with dialogue of little interest to the general reader. The story's detail lacks relevance. Never finished the book.
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|why do i read these? i had such high hopes for this book and it just didn't cut it for me. i will read the last one for the sole purpose of being able to say i finished the series... the only thing i did like about this book is that it didn't flash back to the first one like most series do. so i did not have to re-read any information i had already read. i found myself skipping over the descriptive parts of the book out of boredom.
159420411X|2.0|A waste of time. Silver apparently trying to make money capitalizing on his new fame. He does this with many mind numbing pages on data and events. The more pages, the more that can be charged. Never saw any new insight. His wisdom is that predicting is difficult. No kidding.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|The item arrived on time and in good shape. Plan to use this item as a present for christmas afet the movie comes out.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this game. It is a blast, and the Star War's sound effects remind me of younger days. Fun!

B008QTVNUI|4.0|Homeland owes a lot to Jack Bauer and &#34;24&#34;.  Same Genre, lots of plot twists.  Has all the uncertainties and ambiguities of &#34;X Files&#34;.  Good cast.  Pretty racy.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I was looking forward with much anticipation to the release of this book and was not disappointed.<br />A great follow up to Fooled by Randomness and the Black Swan.<br />His ideas and writings are refreshing and highly relevant.<br />You can disagree with him, but he gives you reason to think.
0316228532|5.0|Casual vacancy sounds like a great book.  I haven't read it yet.  I am taking it with me on my vacation.
159102594X|5.0|After having read quite a few fantasy and sci-fi books over the past years, it's a delight to say that this is one of the best I've had the pleasure of reading. It's on my Kindle, my iPad and my iPhone -- whenever I can I'll snatch a few lines, reread a paragraph, fret about not being able to read more.<br />Abercrombie is doing for Fantasy what Stephenson did for SciFi.<br /><br />This book (the trilogy really) is simply fantastic. Firstly, the characters are amazing. They have real personalities, in the sense that they are not action driven (plot doesn't dictate what characters do). Each one expresses him(her)self differently (don't you hate it when all the characters in a novel talk the same way?), acts and reacts differently. Each one is a different experience. I found that are no boring characters (the feeling I got when reading the Sansa or Onion Knight chapters in Game of Thrones, which I would skip with a groan). It doesn't matter if you are reading a Ninefingers chapter, or a Glotka, or Ferro, or West... they all are engrossing, and all add to the story.<br /><br />The writing is also superb ... well written, with some deeply thought-out ideas (I agree with some critics that verbalizing \\"oofs\\" and \\"unghs\\" is bad style, but there aren't that many to lose the 5 star rating).<br /><br />Magic is sort of there, but you don't find the complex, convoluted magical systems present in other novels. It just happens (but mainly, it's more about steel and stone, than hexes and spells). The idea about the Other Side is interesting, if (unfortunately) underdeveloped.<br /><br />The pace is perfect, although the author could have spent some more time on general realm politics (the Open and Closed Councils are lightly described, at best).<br /><br />This books is leagues ahead of Lynch's Locke Lamora Gentlemen series (ugh!), it's much better than Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicles -- does it compare to Martin's Fire and Ice (Game of Thrones), which are a must read (although avery dull read in the last 2 novels)? Not the same kind of book. This one isn't as \\"epic\\" (if that is a plus, which I'm not sure) .. but just as fun.<br /><br />My advice: buy and read without hesitation.

B0066WJLU6|5.0|great way to get around the house at night when you dont want to wake your family up.I also use it to walk home at night from my friends house.
B004WR125O|4.0|When hooked up to my Onkyo receiver, this little wireless LAN adapter works perfectly with my home network.  When selecting &#34;net&#34; on the remote, the receiver will initialize itself and sych with my network.  This makes it possible to then select from internet radio stations, pandora, and so on.  I usually use Pandora and have had no problems with skipping or buffering delays.  For the money, this little add-on device was well worth it.
B00479SVBU|5.0|My CD player stopped working in my car and this was the perfect solution.  The capacity of the SD card makes this infinitely better than just having a CD player.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the book until the ending.  The ending was not realistic, as was the book.  Everyone I've talked with regarding the book has had the same opinion ie. my best girlfriend and my daughter-in-law.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Wow, this was a book filled with intrigue and suspense.  However, I felt the ending was too long after I knew what happened I wanted it to end but I still loved the book!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is one of my favorite Grisham's books.  The reader feels the pain of an unjust system and is relieved about half way through the book that all is well.  Justice has been served or has it?
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The movie was just amazing! It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time and enjoy the creative adventure. By the way, it was almost like the book!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok for what it is. never spend more than 5 minutes on it but... its a fun 5 minutes. probably more fun for little kids.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|It was a bit boring and repetitve! Although I enjoy J. Depp, this movie didn't do him justice! I enjoyed his make up though!
0307592731|3.0|It was not a book that kept me wanting to read without stopping.  I enjoyed the descriptive nature, but found the book long .
B0002IQOZA|4.0|CA has a great voice, if you like her sound.  The CD had some pretty bad reviews, and I can understand why.  However, it's a Christmas CD.  She does some interpretation on traditional songs, but her voice is so powerful it's worth a listen.  Festive listening, but not the very best one we've ever heard.  Good for the little ones in your life who like music.
0143039482|3.0|I will be anxious to hear what my book club has to say, it was a sad ending.  The author did create a very interesting character.

1401322786|4.0|This is a story about counting, and about time and about love.  It is written in the Mitch Albom style.
B007MDB71O|1.0|i bought this movie from a freind for 3 dollars cause he was gathering money for crack... it was a horrible peice of poo of a movie,the acting was poo-ish the actors looked like poo... i dont recommend it to anyone...
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book is much better than the HBO series would have you believe, not that the show is bad. It seems as if they leave out quite a bit of the detail that is built up in the novel, if you are looking for an engaging story and devious plotline, this is it.
B009CPE424|5.0|Nice sequel. The kids loved the cultural tie in of the quinceañera and family unity. We would have loved to see more of Delgado.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Both my daughter and myself are enjoying the series, so much so that we are competing for Kindle time while on holiday.  Im not sure if these a full copies or abridged though???
B000006YCU|5.0|my son is into dream theater,he even has the decal on his vehicle window,so this cd help complete his collection.very nice and a good deal
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I really enjoyed this and went onto buy the 4 book package in the series -  I havent read the 3rd or 4th yet as Im competing for time on the kindle with my daughter, who is a book ahead of me.
B000002HK4|5.0|also purchased for my son to help complete his collection of<br />dream theater.i think he now has every album.good purchase<br />and glad to find these albums
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|During a famous live recording in Texas recorded for the tour in support of this album, Plant famously declared he was attempting to create &#34;A new style of music&#34;-And he suceeded definitively. All three of his first solo albums are masterpieces of originality and musicianship-Where some would have been devastated by the tragedy of the loss of his friend and bandmate John Bonham, he rose from the flames with a strength that few have matched. Like many, as I listen to these first few solo albums, I can't help but wonder what Led Zeppelin would have accomplished had Bonham lived, but the point is moot-And what we got from Plant far exceeded anything you would expect from a man who's string of personal tragedies could have left him broken. If you shut the door after going in through the out door, you are missing sheer brilliance.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Hot hot and romantic! I just want more and more. I love keeping it fresh with the different story lines going on all at the same time
B000002JKA|5.0|This review will take the reader through a critical review of Dream Theater's third studio album, and their second with James LaBrie. This would also be their third and last with keyboardist Kevin Moore.<br /><br />1. 6:00 - This song serves the album well as the opener, the lyrics written by Kevin Moore. One of Dream Theater's darkest albums, this is undoubtedly the darkest song one the album. The song starts off with random chatter and a high octoban riff, followed by keys and a hard-to-beat Portnoy drum riff. The song, about Moore's reservations regarding his staying in the band, shows a man torn between obligation and happiness. Overall, the song works as a strong opener and a true showing of Dream Theater's metal side.<br /><br />2. Caught in a Web - While not the strongest song on the album, this LaBrie/Petrucci lyrical work tells of a similar story as 6:00, very dark, yet able to make the listener under stand the emotions evoked. While the chorus's melody is somewhat awkward, the song is a typical Dream Theater show off piece, well deserved after their top-ten hit \\"Pull Me Under\\" off the album Images and Words.<br /><br />3. Innocence Faded - A softer song, the piece is written by Petrucci about his dying friendship with Moore. The song is well song, and well written, best portrayed on the album Score, and is one of their best \\"soft\\" songs. There is not as much riffing and less showing off, as the song simply gets right to the point, and perhaps could have been a well selling single.<br /><br />4/5/6. A Mind Beside Itself - What a treat. This three song suite could be considered the start of their \\"rock opera\\" stage, with the next album containing \\"Trial of Tears\\" and the album afterwards a full blown rock opera, the Part 2 to the song Metropolis Part 1, The Miracle and The Sleeper.<br /><br />1) Erotomania - This instrumental is definitely one of their best works on the album. The combination of Portnoy's drums, Moore's intense use of synths, Petrucci's riffs, and Myung's hard \\"balls to the wall\\" style of playing is show at it's pinnacle on this track. The song is mostly in 5/4, and contains numerous changes. The prelude to \\"voices\\" and \\"The Silent Man\\", this song is one f the best Prog instrumentals ever written.<br /><br />2) Voices - Originally written by Petrucci after he read about a man who thought his skin was inside out (no doubt being insane), the song tells of a religiously insane man who questions whether or no he should bring himself from isolation to be a part of society, even if it means not being \\"pure\\". While the song is amazing lyrically, the music is a little lack-luster. Still a part of one of their greatest suites, the song is very thought-provoking.<br /><br />3) The Silent Man - A surprising acoustic song that really is the conclusion to the suite, bringing about a sort of resolve. The whole song was written by Petrucci, and the music video is amazing. While the song didn't sell the greatest (it was a single) it is unique and a great song overall.<br /><br />7. The Mirror - is no doubt the heaviest song on the album, and the first released song with lyrics by Pornoy. Tackling his alcoholism, like he did in the \\"Twelve Step Suite\\", this song is considered the prelude. The song is about a man (Portnoy), who looks in the mirror and hates what he sees. He vows to be a better man. The song is simpler than most, and gets right to the heart of the matter. A fan favorite, the intro riff is on the live album Once in a LIVEtime as \\"Puppies on Acid\\" and the original version is Live Scenes From New York. The song is one of their best and an overall success.<br /><br />8. Lie - This song was originally a simple ending riff on the song \\"The Mirror\\", the the band felt it was strong enough to be it's own song, strong enough, in fact, to be released as a single. A music video of the band looking badass is also cool to see. The lyrics are by Moore and make little sense, other than being about deceit. The track is strong, but best when played with \\"The Mirror\\".<br /><br />9. Lifting Shadows of a Dream - Myung's lyrical contributions are amazing, but the song is weak, much like \\"Scarred\\" and the song is one of my least favorites by Dream Theater. It has a nice softer edge, however; and may attract listeners who liked \\"Surrounded\\" and \\"Space-Dye Vest\\".<br /><br />10. Scarred - Easily the weakest track on the album, this song is more about showing off than anything else. Passing the ten minute mark, I would consider the song more filler than anything, but to each his (or her :P) own.<br /><br />11. Space-Dye Vest - Moore's final contribution to the band, he wrote the whole piece, is much different than any other song the band ever released. Based off of the picture he had of a woman in a space-dye vest, Moore wrote the song about how he felt the love he had for her would only work if she 'stayed on the page\\". While the song is an odd one, it is definitely a nice song and reminds me \\"Wait for Sleep\\", the other song only Moore wrote.<br /><br />Overall the album is one of Dream Theater's best. Like it or hate it, here's a slightly biased ;) opinion of the album Awake by Dream Theater.
044042321X|1.0|If you are a parent considering allowing your teenager to buy this graphic novel, don't.  It is not like Dark Knight novels or those similar.  This graphic novel contains a lot of nudity and the description does not notify you of that.  I allowed my teenage son to purchase and was thankful I thumbed through it prior to giving it to him because I found the nudity within the first 10 pages.  It was promptly returned.  Thank you to Amazon for making the return policy so easy.  My son took the refund money and bought several Star Wars novels instead.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|Works perfectly, it screws onto the inner thread of the lens so it won't pop off.  This really is an afterthought, I think Olympus thought people would be ok with the plastic cap and realized their mistake engineering the lens without a cover.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|I got this app because of the great reviews. I like the functions and actually has great effects, clip art &amp; options BUT not being able to connect with Facebook is a downside. Plus, now that Amazon unlocked the camera I was even more excited to take photos &amp; edit, but no matter what I do the camera is always orientated upside down. Pretty hard to take a photo with your view off. Hope that gets fixed soon.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|The Dark Knight Rises is a great movie! The acting is solid, the action is good. My only complaints are that it starts off a bit slow and its a little too long, as well as it has some plot holes. But overall, this is still a very entertaining fun movie in my opinion.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is a good, sturdy product that fits and protects the Kindle Fire nicely.  The orientation issue that others have complained about is minor if you don't use the camera much in the propped up position (namely, unable to charge while closed if Kindle is inserted with the camera on the right).  Just insert the Kindle with the charging ports facing outwards (camera on the left).  The screen rotates and there are no hard buttons on the face of the screen, so really there is no right-side-up or upside down.  The automatic screen off function does still work in this configuration (at least on mine it does).  I personally like the strap closure over the magnetic one as it provides more protection when placed in a purse or bag.  The only slight complaint I have is that I don't care much for the textured leather surface, would rather have it smooth, but that's just personal preference.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Works perfectly, excellent quality.  I can stand it and listen to the radio at work all day, at home I can even sit it up to read.
B008VBYN80|5.0|good game very fun highly enjoyed great for killing time easy to play loads quickly highly enjoyable glad to have downloaded
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The book presented a dilemma:  I wanted to learn what happened to the characters, but I did not want the book to end.  There  were several incidents that seemed a bit dragged out; but the plot moved along and the characters remained true to themselves.  Even Daisy's transformation seemed believable; and Carla was a true heroine.  You could enjoy this book without having read Fall of Giants, but I'm glad I did read it.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|For any Julie Andrews fanatic and/or Sound of Music worshipper! I NEVER get tired of watching this and this gorgeous edition does this great film justice. Now if it only included snapshots of the stars themselves, I would die happy. A must-have for any decent family who wants to bring back the joyful pleasure of this film classic!
B006ZNRD06|1.0|It seems like it will work great at first. Then it starts taking screen shots for no reason. Made my kindle act wierd. Froze it. I couldnt even shut it off at first.
0596007124|5.0|Headfirst books fit my brain.<br /><br />Not all the Headfirst books are 5 stars, but this one is. The examples are written in Java, but can be applied to any OO programming language, IMO.
B00AC8ZJ6K|2.0|It was only about the last 10 minutes that were &#34;exiting&#34; and engaging, where it started to really look like halo, using the same characters.  The rest of the movie was VERY long and DRAWN out.....too much time spent on details of character building that had no consequence to the theme/outcome of the movie.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|This is fun and wickedly difficult. I can only stand it for 45 minutes before I have to put it down for a bit. I haven't gotten to the end yet. I keep coming back though.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|This book hooked me on Morgan's work and the Kovacs universe. I highly recommend it if you like hardboiled sci-fi. A little like effinger's Budayeen novels. Great worldbuilding, great read.
B006O6F932|5.0|The product is very nice my daughter was so satisfied about it! Always happy-I will buy it once more everytime!
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|Even though I really wanted to find out the final outcome of this book and decided to finish it, I found many parts so boring and wordy that I did a lot og skimming.  Much of the info that went on and on was not really necessary to the storyline.
1426209584|5.0|This is a truly remarkable book - first class all the way. All of the many pictures in this book are stunning. Having lived in Papua New Guinea for over a year and having observed most of the PNG species I can truly say that this is a must have book for anyone interested in these magnificent birds. The layout of the book is excellent. Starting with photographs of all 39 species it goes on to describe and show us, by means of photos, the remarkable evolution and courtship displays of these unique birds. The book also treats us to many historical anecdotes touching on the influence they continue to have on the many tribes that inhabit this fascinating but hostile land. The book ends with summaries of the life history, distribution and status of all 39 species not the least of which is a summary of the photographic equipment used. Terrific. Thanks Mr Laman and Scholes for your hard work.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is a fabulous movie....Happy I bought it! . . . . . . . . . . . .
B002JVWQT6|5.0|this show just cracks me up. Can't stop laughing at how true alot of their story lines are. Can't wait to finish all three discs.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is really great.  I think it has the power to reach accross generations.  I wish that I would have read it when I was in high school.  Even today it has the power to open my eyes to something I knew was their but couldn't see.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I enjoyed the story of Fifty Shades, however it was very repetitious.  3 books could have been condensed into one.
B0027MJU00|5.0|loved this book!  i decided to give Flynn another shot, as I was really disappointed with the way 'Gone Girl' had ended.  I'm glad I did.  I had a very hard time putting this book down.  The story is really well written (from the perspective of different family members) and she wastes no time with unnecessary dialogue.  I have to say, though, that you'll find it difficult to feel sympathy for any of the characters- the mother was an exception for me though- but despite that, it's a twisted and engaging story.  well done.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This season as the previous seasons did not disappoint! I always learn something new from this show. Especially Dr. Reids character. Always entertaining and educational! Excellant!
0385424736|5.0|Appreciated and enjoyed by recipient who is a huge John Grisham fan!  Would recommend for all fans of this author.
B001FB4VY4|5.0|fast responder. sent with care. great packaging. item was as discribed to a tee. would give recommendation to others. A+++ service.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Received on time as promised for a huge Grisham fan, who has not received it yet, but I am sure it will be enjoyed and appreciated.  Would recommend for any fan of this particular author!
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|fast responder. sent with care. great packaging. item was as discribed to a tee. would give recommendation to others. A+++ service.
B0085YNML2|5.0|It is the same idea as Cut The Rope and just as fun. This looks and works great on my Kindle fire.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|This is a very good price for this watch even though the stated retail was much higher than ShopNBC has the watch for.  However ShopNBC has the power to buy hundreds of the same watch.  I used to have a Pro Diver which was lost in a house fire a few years ago.  So this will serve as a very good replacement.  Plus I can always pay ShopNBC for a 5-year extension plan on the watch in case the quartz battery needs to be replaced.  All together I am very pleased.
B004Q0SQ24|5.0|My 15 month son loves Wilson and all the chuggington chuggers! We got him the imaginarium table for xmas and were scared that the chuggington trains wouldn't fit so we tested them all out and they fit the imaginarium table (wohooo) I have heard they don't fit some of the Thomas bridges and tunnels but rest assure they work with imaginarium! YAY! Can't wait for my son to open his table on xmas day! and FYI the Thomas wooden trains also fit/work with the table (we collect both).<br />My only complain with Wilson is that his paint is chipping off, however my son always took him everywhere! I've since bought him the die cast Wilson since their cheaper; he's allowed to take that one out.
0525952926|5.0|The price was great and the condition was great too. What more can I ask for when reading a wonderful book.
B008LOSGUI|5.0|First: it's LEGO brand. 2nd: it came right to my door exactly as ordered. Same thing as in the store. Good product, durable and you won't even have to find a parking spot!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Not appropriate for all audiences, but if you think Family Guy is funny, than you'll really like this.  Highly recommend.
B0002ZDVF4|3.0|I didn't enjoy this Bourne as much as the first one. I am still glad that I purchased it so that i will not be out of the loop when I see the third.
B001M0HGR2|4.0|Good sound and special effects.  Relatively boring and predictable though.  The first one was a little better, but nothing new as far as sequels go.
B001XRLWPQ|3.0|It is an enjoyable series but not quite as engaging as I had hoped. I would recommend it as long as the price is right!
B007PBL9KC|5.0|I realize with that heading...I may be in for some criticism but... these guys and gals are really something! Yes I have seen them live at their first U.S. appearance in Columbus Ohio. Wow! Now they don't really sound like Fleetwood Mac, I'm just comparing because the band is a blend of male and female musicians, songwriters and vocalists. The end result is compelling. Of course everyone loves &#34;Little Talks&#34;, but the album as a whole should be explored. The songwriting is top-notch, the harmony vocals are quite impressive and the instrumentation is eclectic.( Trumpet and accordion for example) Overall, this band is a refreshing breeze in the wake of so many sound-alike bands. They are unique enough to catch your ear, and relevant enough to merit real attention. I was never on the Bjork train but with these folks I'm all aboard. Go Iceland!
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|I liked it ,and I bought it because I have the first one,I really didn't like this one as much as I did the first one.I do find it hard that Robert Downey Jr would agree to act in either of these two movies.But again this is just my thoughts.
B0014DCTCY|5.0|This is a half-speed mastered version of the Black Keys first real &#34;produced&#34; record. If you don't know, half-speed mastering is a process that results in really killer sound. Essentially, it sounds more &#34;punched&#34;....more bass, more subtleties , more dynamic range...in a word Awesome! There is no better way to hear the Keys than this. ( Except of course Live) Furthermore, at this price it is an absolute bargain. Most half-speed mastered records cost twice the price. Buy it!
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|I liked this movie .I was intrerested in the movie through out the complete film.I am glad I bought this movie.
B004TACMZ8|4.0|This stud finder does an excellent job finding studs in the wall, I have had bad experiences with many others however this one is the genuine article.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I liked this movie when my kids were small, and now I can share this movie with my grandchildren.  Amazon has the best customer service that I have ever encountered.  I have told so many people how quick my orders arrive, and how easy it is to order gifts.  I have severe arthritis that limits how long I can walk let alone stand in lines.  I now have no excuse not to shop when I can do it from my computer.  My grandchildren are going to be so excited with the gifts they are receiving this year.<br />Thank you so much for great choices and quick shipping as well as the customer service representatives that I have spoken to when I ordered incorrectly.  Both online and telephone made the refund exchange so easy.<br />Thank you,<br />Jean Cyford
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie was indeed excellent, a good closing or opening to another film if they choose to make it. Good job Amazon having it for a good price to watch!

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|visually stunning. kept me on the edge of the seat. looks amazing in blu ray. haven't even begun the overwhelming amount of extras. put the digital copy on my ipod. good story. good acting. made me want to watch alien after.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Saw the first movie in theaters.  Loved it.  Decided to read all the books.  Loved them more.  Read them all again just to make sure I didn't miss anything (I did).  This movie is the culmination of all the previous experiences of young Harry, and adequately covers the necessary material from the literary version.
B007PKDW44|5.0|I love this CD.  Way better than I expected.  Usually there is only 2 or 3 good songs and the rest are crap...not this one!  All good.
B001TODCII|4.0|Can one man take on scores of bad guys, and come away with little more than a few scratches and bruises?  No.  But any dad who watches this movie will see himself doing the same thing for his daughter.  The characters are believable, but the action sequences are not so much.  The thing that detracts from the realism, that many movies are guilty of, is how the lower-level bad guys get taken out of commission with one punch or kick, while the bosses take several minutes to incapacitate.  I didn't see it in the theater, and I don't regret that decision.  It's a great action flick, but not on the level of a Bourne movie, or a Bond movie.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Halestorm has done it again!  Their Sophomore CD rocks!  I have nearly worn it out already...can't get enough!  I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to hear some serious talent!
B008VBYN80|4.0|good game to play lots of fun not hard great game to play when you r bored just started so not sure how far u can go
B005NS0VNU|5.0|Legends of rock and roll.  This CD just epitomizes how great this band is!  Brings back a lot of good memories.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|It is rare to get wisdom from a book. Taleb's approach to the world we live in gives the reader understanding that I wish our nations leaders had.  The fact that they don't or won't act accordingly if they do, means that we all need this understaning to protect ourselves and our familys.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I have this game and we play it all the time.  I have given it to family and friends, and it is always a hit.  Great for ages 6-106.

Eventually the knee pain went away, but it took a long time. Her warm up and cool down stretching are not enough. I always had to do additional stretching otherwise I would be too sore the next day.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|If some one rated this one star then don't listen to them!!!!!! at the beginning of the game it does tell u if there r any specials on gems ( the things u buy with money) but that is all. if ur child keeps seeing it they might be accidentally clicking on the gems and ( even I do it and I had it for a year) it brings it up.  THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER GET IT AND TELL EVERYONE HOW GREAT IT IS

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Hazel has cancer and is going to die. Isaac has cancer and will lose his sight. Augustus has cancer and has lost a leg. These teenagers find each other at an adolescent cancer support group convened in the Literal Heart of Jesus. They explore the possibilities and limits of life and love and mortality. Their author presents his characters as precocious, perceptive and extremely articulate, using gallows humors freely while feeling a tad bit guilty they take advantage of Cancer Perks. This is poignant, rather than sad, which doesn't mean you won't need tissues a couple of times. The ending is a bit rushed, not matching the thoughtfulness of the rest of the book. It was only after I finished the book that I realized this was written for the youth/young adult market.  Still a recommended read for adults.
B001EQPD8S|3.0|To have music this good and singing this bad together is a real crying shame. During the instrumental parts, you realize how talented this band will become. But the singing is so bad when it is there that you literally want to take a hammer to the CD. This is a one time listen and then put this CD in a deep dark drawer never to be seen again.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Vintage Tom Clancy.  Fast moving.  Lots of interesting characters and believable action.  Once again, is Clancy a few months or years ahead of the newspaper headlines?
0545123275|5.0|I just read the most incredibly beautiful and well-written young adult novel I've ever read. Maggie Stiefvater is an amazing story teller, her prose captivating and compelling and her stories completely original.<br /><br />Shiver is a love story, between two people, a boy who changes into a werewolf as the weather cools and the girl who has loved him since the day he saved her life from his pack. As the story unfolds the point of view changes with each chapter as they each tell their story.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|Van Morrison writes music for music lovers. This album is so beautifully produced and recorded, but the instrumentation, arrangements, melodies and clever hooks and licks will put this album in heavy rotation in your song list. Morrison plays and writes music for music's sake, but never turns out anything but thoughtful, high quality work. Intimidating. Buy this album, it is a great value.
0545425115|5.0|With over 10,000 reviews and a hit movie, there is little left to be said about Suzanne Collins' \\"The Hunger Games\\".  I admit I'm a little late in coming to the game, but I'm glad I finally got a chance to read this book.  It is an incredibly hard to put down book that will leave readers gasping for more.<br /><br />Everyone knows the basic plot.  In a dystopian world, two tributes from each district of Panem must compete in the Hunger Games.  Winning means becoming rich; losing means certain death.  When Katniss Everden hears her sister's name called at the annual selection process, she volunteers herself.  Unwittingly, she finds herself a favorite among the Gamemakers, especially after her fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark, declares his undying love for her.  Katniss has incredible prowess with a bow and arrow, but isn't looking forward to facing off against Peeta to win the games.  The longer she stays in the games the more she questions the rules that regulate their existence - the hardships that people face in the outer districts compared with the ease and frivolousness of life in the Capitol.  Can Katniss find a way to win the games but subvert the intentions of the Gamemakers who see nothing wrong with making children kill each other for sport?<br /><br />Collins has crafted a unique dystopian story that will appeal to male and female readers alike.  So many young adult novels seem to be directed towards one or the other, but \\"The Hunger Games\\", even though narrated by Katniss, will certainly be enjoyed by male readers.  Collins keeps the action going, causing readers to push ahead at breakneck speed and thirsting for more when they reach the end of this first book.  I cannot wait to read the second in the trilogy to find out how  this disturbing dystopian world can change.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This is fantastic! the story and everything about it is a must for adults. I have seen the movie 2X before, but it is soooo much better in Blu-ray.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Great show. I was surprised by its premise at first but I'm hooked! Can't wait to catch up on episodes.
075669812X|5.0|It is the Ningago series which my grandson is into big time. It will let him compare what he has in this collection and what he needs. It's fun for the kids and helps them with their reading skills also.

B003B02PFO|3.0|A good book which in a backwards way reminded me of the importance of Christmas and not to get caught up in the commercial aspect of Christmas.
0553108034|5.0|I'm so enjoying this series that I had to buy the book. I even donated it to the library so the 60 or so people waiting for it have another copy to circulate.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|I love this movie! My family and I watched it via Redbox about a year ago. I had forgotten all about it until my mom mentioned it again; I knew I had to purchase it and add it to my collection immediately!
B005HSL626|4.0|More addicting than angry birds. I know I'm a little late downloading it but...I was bored. Than I couldn't stop playing.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|I have to admit I'm a little distracted by her beauty but I sure love hearing her sing! I purchased \\"come away with me\\" not too long ago and I listen to it quite a bit. She sings realistic songs of love and life,..sometimes a little bittersweet but never depressing. She's both professional and personal which to me is a rare trait. She really is a beautiful person through and through!

B00A757EFW|3.0|Was nostalgic for me.  A little difficult to move without the joystick that is why I gave it 3 stars.<br />Difficult for the young ones.

B005DOL0R0|2.0|This is okay for protecting the k fire when you want to transport it, however an actual cover that does not have to be removed to use the kfire would have served me better
B002KJX4IE|5.0|I grew up with this movie so I am probably biased and experiencing nostalgia but I love it.  It was nice to have it upscaled also.
B001RNO79E|5.0|I was skeptical of the color when I ordered them but they turned out to be a nice brown instead of redish. They are solid, comfortable, and appear<br />To be very durable. They seem to be breaking in nice just by daily use. Glad I bought them.
B007SGM084|4.0|A fun and sexy read!!  I was shaking my head in disbelief a lot - LOL.  Was a lot of fun.
0802130208|5.0|How anyone can honestly say they did not think this book funny, and that they did not laugh out loud,  I simply cannot understand.  I have read hundreds maybe thousands of books in my long life, and this is the best of the fiction.  Too bad it has not yet been made into a movie.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|The product is as described. The case is slim and attractive, and the attached elastic band holds the case securely shut during travel. The Kindle mounts and is held firmly in place by four snap-in plastic connectors. The case can be adjusted to have the Kindle desktop display in the landscape position, it does not allow for portrait displays. There are no speaker vents/holes, speakers sound muffled when case is held in hand, desktop the speakers sound fine. The case also allows for mounting the Kindle with micro-B connector/micro-D connector exposed or protected by the closed case. Overall very satisfied.<br />Amazon price was very competitive, I received a very good case for the money. Delivery was free 3-5 day and arrived in 4.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A neat game or shall I say puzzle, it makes you think and is fun to do, it is a good download.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|my daughter is a fan of super natural she has all the rest so this completed her collection so thanks
B009WO7NQO|4.0|until you figure out how the gravity/lack of gravity works.  But figuring these things out is half the fun of playing the game. I enjoy it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is truly the best in this detective novel genre.  His writing is crisp, the plots and characters well-developed and always believable.  &#34;The Black Box&#34; is the latest in the Harry Bosch series and perhaps one of Connelly's finest.  The further development of Bosch's relationship with his teenage daughter and the dynamic of Bosch as a single father makes the book more than a cop drama and adds to the reader's interest in the crime story being told.  I just hope we are able to continue to read about Bosch and his daughter over the next several years as Harry carries on in Cold Cases.
B0035G0U2O|4.0|Actually, the concept is pretty cool on how the Earth changes may happen (and may still be valid, actually, just not today).<br /><br />Some really good acting here, pretty good editing and reasonablly succinct dialog.<br /><br />Without trying to add any spoilers, I find it interesting that the world depends on the Chineese (and LOTS of money) to save selected humankind and animals.<br /><br />Bottom line, one thumb up, 4 stars, if you like disaster movies and can suspend beleive for awhile, this is worth a watch.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I was fooled into thinking that with all the 5 star ratings that this would be a good book!  WRONG!  I didn't even make it through chapter one!  I am not sure what it so \\"sexy\\" about a guy who sleeps around, has a vulgar mouth and is violent.  Whatever happend to wanting a good man, with morals and willing to treat a women with respect?? Good thing for me I borrowed it from my library and didn't waste any money!!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read I recommend it go  all ages. It tells of the fun kid who lives in a mysterious world
0262731541|3.0|Whereas Sheldon explains everything so you can understand it, this book seemed like it was too indepth.  No disrespect to the author, it was just too much information for me to &#34;grab and go&#34;  on the topics I wanted to learn about.  For now I'll stick to Bicyclings guide to bikes.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|This is very a slap stick humor movie - and I knew that going in. Not my style of humor anymore - but I watched the whole thing anyhow because I loved a few actors in the movie.  If you like slap stick humor - this may very well be the movie for you.
1593082037|5.0|Got this for our second daughter.  She will blaze through a book an inch and a half thick in a matter of hours!  I got her this because she was halfway interested and to get her into what I call &#34;actual literature&#34;.  She took a break from the Hunger Games and Harry Potter and actually enjoyed this book.  I like it because you get so many stories all in one place.  This keeps the clutter down in her room. Ha ha.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|If you like espionage thrillers this series is for you.  Showtime has surpassed all their other series in this serial drama.  Each episode builds on the previous episode and you will find yourself watching it in a marathon.  Some of the plot directions may seem implausible but the writing is so good that it all feels like it could really happen.  It is definitely like other premium channel series in that it is adult only, not a show to share with the kids.  I can't wait for the season 2 DVD!
B001P4IQSI|5.0|This classic masterpiece will live on forever. Like an old friend or that comfortable pair of jeans, listening to this classic is a reunion between your ears and greatness.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This is a beautifully constructed book, like a school text book had a wet dream. If a great website went analog it might look something like this.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|If you are a fan of Les Mis you will not be disappointed. And Amazon's price of $5 for the mp3 version is a steal!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I bought this at the recommendation of a friend who raved about it.  I thought it was a well written book and good read but it didn't grab me emotionally like I thought it would.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|I have watched this movie and really enjoyed it.  It's very cute and has a great message. Especially compared to many crappy animated Christmas stories, this one is pretty cool.<br /><br />I just don't get why I could rent it a week ago and suddenly it is on \\"rental pre-order\\"?
B005LAJ16I|5.0|we made every excuse to stay home and watch this series of Homeland, it absolutely caught us up in it...
B008XG1X18|5.0|Works perfectly! Very easy to navigate and search for other pins and you can pin from the browser too. Love it!
B000M341QE|1.0|Well, I finally got around to watching this movie; had it sitting on the shelf for years.<br /><br />OK, the plot had some holes and the movie really leaned on cell-phones as an important plot device.<br /><br />But several times I muttered to myself \\"what a good movie.\\" Some really over the top acting by an all-star cast. Lots of tricky movie fun.<br /><br />Then, what, in the last 15 minutes the movie crashed and burned into arch silliness. I mean really dumb. What? Did the scriptwriters run out of paper, or something?<br /><br />Was this really Martin Scorsese? Of \\"Goodfellas\\" fame? I expected more; much more.<br /><br />Bang, bang, bang, bang. The sound of a painfully bad ending. It really does ruin the movie.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|I think the title of the review is enough said, the movie is just another a different kind of funny.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Always liked a few tunes from Maroon 5, but I find myself replaying this one constantly. Bought a few for Christmas gifts, too!
B002VHI8J0|1.0|Original, clever writing.  The use of futuristic ideas was interesting. Overall I found it all a bit morose in the reading, a bit defeatist.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Kate Morton isn't a prolific writer.  So it is a real gift when she does publish a new book.  Typical of Kate Morton, there is a mystery to solve and the book jumps back and forth in time as a little more information is exposed.  Fans won't be disappointed.  A very satisfying ending.  I never guessed.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|It was ok. I think the franchise should quit now unless the story line and scripts improve. I would reccomend it only if there is nothing better to watch.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|Over a year later I'm still conflicted about this record. To be honest, I think this my be their weakest album to date. That's not to say that it isn't skillfully done or lacking enjoyable tunes, but at the end of the day there seems to be too much thrown into the mix.<br /><br />I appreciate that the group is continuing to progress. I loved Viva La Vida and really felt the band had upped their game by branching out and doing something unexpected. However, I had fears that this record would be a rehashing of that release and I'm happy to say they did something different. Does it work as well as it did on the last album? Personally, I don't think so but kudos for trying are certainly in order. I simply don't find many of these songs memorable. \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart\\", \\"Charlie Brown\\", and \\"Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall\\" are all excellent and build to exciting climaxes in typical Coldplay style. Unfortunately many of the tracks fail to really leave an impression and feel bloated. There are certainly some neat soundscapes on this record but they don't compliment the songs. \\"Princess of China\\" shows some promise until Rihanna's nasally vocals kill the momentum, while \\"Major Minus\\" and \\"Paradise\\"  are somewhat catchy but offer little else to keep me coming back. In short: these songs seem to lack the heart and passion that the band is known for. No amount of synthesizers and electronic sounds can lift these songs to the next level. Artists like U2, Beck, and Radiohead are able to do this quite well but it seems Coldplay is struggling to find that balance. They make a good effort here but it doesn't have the desired effect of taking you somewhere else.<br /><br />Perhaps my biggest gripe is with the album's mastering. It's painfully loud and distracts from the textures used throughout the record. The loudness wars have been getting progressively worse over the years and this album is unfortunately another victim. I think many of these songs would have benefitted from more room to breathe and far more dynamic range, something that the band's other records had on their side. Sadly, the sound quality really kills whatever momentum this album might have going for it.<br /><br />Overall, Mylo Xyloto isn't a bad album by any means, nor is is a great one. It straddles the middle, offering some amazing tracks with a hefty dose of filler along the way. It's enjoyable for what it is but fails to leave the lasting impression one might be hoping for.rom more room to breathe and far more dynamic range, something that the band's other records had on their side.

0553382179|1.0|This book is clearly geared toward people who do not work and are basically severe hoarders.My husband and I work full time and I was hoping for something that would provide tips and tricks for making housework more efficient and for keeping better organized, so that we spend less of our free time cleaning.  Instead, I found an entire chapter devoted to getting out of bed and getting dressed each morning.  Um, I've got that taken care of, thanks. If you are the average working person and just want some tips and tricks, don't waste your money on this book.
0547884591|4.0|I did like this book.  However, I don't remember the last time I got a 10 lb. book in the mail aside from the old school Sears catalogs or a hardcover Webster's Dictionary.<br /><br />I appreciate why the book was so long since it includes a lot of \\"how-to\\" with recipes and other nitty-gritty information about food including how things are made (i.e. the process in which balsamic vinegar is made, how to kill a chicken, etc.).  But, quite honestly, I didn't buy the book to learn how to cook.  I hate cooking and I still do.<br /><br />What I did like about this book would be about the first 100 pages or so that teaches you how to learn anything at super fast speed.  This includes languages, dancing, cooking, or anything else you want to learn...and fast.  Tim is the first one I've ever seen to illustrate that you not need to have 10,000 hours of practice to become good at or an expert in almost anything provided that you understand how the \\"crash course\\" methodology works and Tim puts methodology together for you.<br /><br />And he explains it quite well.<br /><br />What I wish he would have done was split this into 2 books where he could teach people how to cook in one book and teach people \\"how to learn anything in 6 weeks or less\\" in another book.  I would have bought the 2nd book and not bothered with the cooking book at all.  It seems that the cooking part actually got in the way.  Just when he was getting into the swing of things with how to learn something at a super fast speed, he'd throw some cooking crap in there and I'd have to find myself skimming through it just to continue on with what he was talking about with learning faster.<br /><br />I really did like his 2 principles of learning fast which are:<br /><br />1)  Failure points - addressing the tripping points and how to work to eliminate/overcome them.  These are the points in which people give up on any endeavor because it's too hard, complicated, etc.<br /><br />2)  Margin of safety - picking the most important elements of whatever you're trying to do and making sure that if you choose well, even if your execution is off, you'll still be successful.  He illustrates this by having you choose recipes well so that if you fail to make it even near perfect, the result will still be awesome.<br /><br />He also makes it clear that if you are going to become successful in anything, you have to give yourself an ultimatum of sorts.  If you fail, what are the consequences?  People who have no consequences for not meeting their goals usually don't meet their goals.<br /><br />He has some pretty awesome points on success that I've never read in any other type of book before, and I read a lot of success books.<br /><br />For that reason, I recommend this book.  Even if you have no interest in cooking, read the book anyway for the first 1/4 of it where you can really learn how to change your life through learning and becoming successful at anything you want to in the shortest amount of time imaginable.st important elements of whatever you're trying to do and making sure that if you choose well, even if your execution is off, you'll still be successful.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle having heard how good it was and women loved it. Wow, I won't do that again without finding out more. The first couple of chapters I couldn't get over how poorly written this book is. For example, when doing a photo shoot at a hotel a woman directs someone to \\"call housekeeping for some refreshments\\". The writer obviously has only stayed in hotels where refreshments are delivered by housekeeping rather than room service. But I kept plowing through. Ana uses all these golly gee phrases - really? Is she from Mayberry? Then comes the smut. Pure unadulterated pornography. And this woman Ana is a college age virgin falling for this crap? Right. I couldn't delete it off my Kindle fast enough.

B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I downloaded this for my 10yr old daughter and she loves it! I don't play it  but she has pretty much murdered my kindle fire playing it!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I really love this show. The DVD came exactly as advertised. There's nothing more that really needs to be said.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Just what I wanted.  Have been a fan of this series since it cam out in the 80's, yes, I'm that old.  Have it on VHS, DVd, and now Blu-ray.  Am very happy with the quality and responce time.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|There were parts of this book that I couldn't put down then it would lose me for awhile. I don't know if I was ready for Proof of Heaven. I lost my husband not that long ago and had some trouble with some of the medical parts. My husband to had no brain activity and I had to make that hard decision. sometimes books like this make me wonder if i should have hung in there a little longer. It does help that Dr Alexander experienced Heaven and helps me feel that I too will see my loved ones again.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Perfect addition to my library.  Not to mention that I love the whole series of films.  I don't have many Blu-ray movies in my collection, so I was happy to add this one.  It's all you promised!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Received before Christmas to give as a gift so we haven't opened it yet.  Hopefully the gift receiver will enjoy it.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Just didn't live up to either Alien nor Aliens, but the others didn't as well. Characters were just not believable.
B001NZX69S|4.0|I have on 8 track or cassette tape. One of those albums that rocked back in the day. Check it out.
B00936A0ZW|5.0|Not what I expected. Is way better than what I thought would already be a great CD. Didn't know Paul Gilbert could sing like that. This CD has blues, prog, rock, instrumentals, great vocals, keyboards rock, Thomas lang tears it up and of course the guitar is awsome.. super impressed...
B004EPZ070|3.0|Kate Hudson's worst character but she made the film with enough electricity, eccentricity and elan to compensate for the weak willed wimpy others, so far so good.... never been to the Hamptons so got the seXy beach tour for a plus, liked the 90's music redux, with the closed caption option on you get to see the lyrics which I was completely unaware of and made me appreciate the artists of that time, was surprised the women had such muscular legs and they were constantly wearing mini-skirts....  had such low expectations for this film, so every staid plot device made it just amazing to see how NYC apartments are decorated, lol  ending seemed to scream sequel, how lucky can one get???  something blue....
B005LJK3AC|3.0|This is a movie working people can relate to. The main characters, men with white-collar jobs, hate their bosses for good reason. Even Dale, a dental assistant who’s sexually harrassed by his hot chick boss, is justified because he wants to remain monogamous to his fianc&eacute;e. Those constant advances are supposed to be funny, and sometimes they are, but the sexist double standard they take advantage of isn’t lost on me.<br /><br />As far as malice goes, the dentist is by far the least horrible of the three bosses. She is at least attracted to Dale in a positive way. His two best friends, Nick and Kurt, have to put-up with bosses who seem to hate them right back. So, sitting in a bar one day, the three goofballs come-up with the idea to kill their bosses. Once that plot point is set, you’re hooked in, waiting to see how everything is going to turn-out in the end.<br /><br />Too bad the story doesn’t go for real suspense. It’s built upon a simple yet potentially brilliant concept that could’ve worked wonders in a serious movie. As a comedy, one that’s consistently almost funny but never really funny, everything from how horrible the bosses are to how the workers go about planning to kill them is caricatured to unrealistic proportions. The ending you wait an hour and a half for is especially ridiculous.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B002JVWR4U|5.0|What can I say, I already own season 1, heheh.  No, in all seriousness its I like it.  I like Joss Whedon's stuff and Eliza Dushku is hot.
B004FECNIO|2.0|Intelligence? Not so much. This movie, which lasts for about two and a half hours, is stupid most of the time. That starts at the initial premise, the creation of a robot child; a mecha; designed to \\"love\\". It's a loaded term that is never clearly defined, but, judging by the behavior of the boy, it apparently has to do with romantic obsession. The fact that it's his adoptive \\"mommy\\" he feels that way toward gives the story an incestous underlining. The ending, in which the two spend the day together and gaze into each other's eyes to dreamy orchestral music, gets downright pedophilic. I was waiting for them to start having sex right then and there.<br /><br />But their creepy relationship and the things that happen around it during the first third of the movie is the best part. It leads to a genuinely despondent abandonment scene, one of the few times in which puppet-master Steven Spielberg's heartstringing actually works. From there, the tone changes from psychological drama to action adventure; the boy, his toy bear and an expendable mecha-man must find their way to The Blue Fairy before being killed by the evil humans; back to a different kind of psychological drama. It's that last third, in which Steven Spielberg goes for an extended epilogue, that comes across as meandering and pretentious.<br /><br />If Artificial Intelligence is supposed to represent some big important metaphor or make its audience ponder deep philosophical questions, the effort is lost on me. My questions have more to do with the logic of the plot. How, for instance, can the boy survive for years under water if he breaks when he tries to eat a few spoonfuls of spinach? Why do the \\"parents\\" even bother to sit him at the family dinner table with a plate of food if he can't eat? Why was the child programmed to love only the mother and not the father? They're petty arguments, I know, but asking them is more fun and engaging than anything this new-age Pinocchio has to offer.<br /><br />marcellee.com.com
0316023744|4.0|I would truly rate this book 4 1/2 stars for it's content and completeness but I have read many other WW II books that were much more compelling to read. This book simply didn't have the \\"page turner\\" appeal to me. I found the author's emphasis on certain events,such as the asian influence of the start of WWII, interesting since most other WW II summaries have focused more on Europe. The author also did a great job of truly making every chapter separate and with a different focus of the War which was needed due to immense amount of information.There are just so many great books written about the War that for me to truly rate this 5 stars I would not be truthful. It's a solid book, just simply not one of the best.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Most interesting, mainly because the doctor's higher brain functions appeared ravaged by disease. I haven't seen other &#34;heaven&#34; by a person who appeared brain brain dead
B0076DELIG|5.0|Enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Thanks.  I thought the plot was excellent and as always Mr. Connelly does a great job on character development.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|A very delightful movie, with excellent songs. Even after many years still a great story about truth, beauty, freedom and above all love.
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|The first Daniel Craig, Bond film is better. If you are a Bond fan, I recommend Solace, as Daniel Craig, in my opinion, is the closest to the Sean Connery Bond! Hoping the next one surpasses the second.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read the book after I had seen the movie, and I loved both. It made me think and think, which is a good thing. I am not sure if I understood everything the author was saying, but I really loved both.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a beautiful looking app for the kindle fire. It gives you a lot of info and useful tools. Definitely pick this app up.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|My husband always has his head in the clouds, and now he can see the stars and constellations too.<br /> Actually this is the first app that we've ever bought and we love it!
1416563156|5.0|Super cool.  This journal has the look and feel of actually being Indiana's journal.  The size is a little bigger than I expected but not huge.  This will be fun to read with my little Indiana Jones fan.  Although, it's so nice, that I might keep it up on a shelf, rather than let him play with it.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Great picture. I RECOMMEND THIS PICTURE TO ALL ADULTS. Screenplay, directing and acting are outstanding!! This picture will bring you to tears!!!
B00866JL96|5.0|this product came in very fast. i deff love it. i recommend this movie to anyone. such a good story
B0082EOJYE|3.0|This movie was creative in concept, but the &#34;silent treatment&#34; didn't work for me. I am rather surprised it won the best picture oscar last year. I would recommend this picture only to college film majors.The lack of audible dialogue made this movie very tedious.
B005LAII12|5.0|came in as soon as it came out! awesome product. came with digital copy too! recommend to everyone! love it
B00622B3MY|4.0|My 3 yr old boys love the original Cars movie so one day when we had nothing else to do I bought them Cars 2 via Amazon Instant Video.  The story is a little too deep for 3 yr olds with not enough to keep them interested.  The sequel seemed geared toward an older audience and personally I enjoyed watching it.  Oh well, 3 yr olds shouldn't be watching TV anyway, right?!<br /><br />UPDATE: My boys are now 4 years old and all of a sudden love this movie so I had to give it another star.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|came in very fast. love all the songs! greats quailty and i would recommend it to anyone who loves taylor swift!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I never get bored doing the same puzzle over and over.  The finished picture is almost in 3-D.  I also like the variety of pictures to choose from.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very useful and non-invasive. as battery apps go, i would have paid for it. i especially enjoy the artist bubbling of the battery level and how it comes up when i plug my kindle. even tells you useful activities you do and how long your battery will last doing them (such as reading time, chrging time, etc). awesome app.
0375842209|5.0|As a Sr citizen AND a former teacher I have read thousands of books in my life. I put this book in my top 5 of all time. A heart rending story that places you in it. Ever read a believable story narrated by the Grim Reaper? This is it.! Zusak builds his characters to make them as familiar as your neighbors and in light of historical facts of WWII  a strong feeling that the story is true. A voracious reader myself, I can relate to Liesel's stealing of books no matter the risk but I am thankful  her life is not mine. A 'must read' for people who have had an easy life or do not value democracy.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|I enjoyed the movie however, I read the book titled the same name and the movie didn't follow the story line of the book at all.<br />I picked up the book because of the &#34;Bourne&#34; title.  I found the book was more in the vein of the previous &#34;Bourne&#34; movies.<br />This movie, to me, was more of a &#34;prequel&#34;.  The movie was a good one for the excitement but I was expecting more of the books story line.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Keeps you watching thats for sure. This is a greAT SHOW THAT i UNFORTUINATLY CANT FOLLOW ON tv, AND HAVE TO GET IT ON kINDLE WHEN AVAILABLE.
B005T87QCI|5.0|If you played with those things when you were little, you've got to watch this movie. Great action with a nice story underline. Good all around movie about not giving up.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a great app to have. have used it multiple times since downloading it. recommend it to any and every one.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I enjoyed the way they constructed the storyline of this movie to lead up to the original Aliens movie. Very well done with pretty good drama between the characters and intense action. It answered some questions as to where the aliens came from and why.
B0092ZEIN4|5.0|I bought this in December of 2012. I couldn't get the darn thing to connect to my phone but I recently decided to give it a shot on my Galaxy and it works like a charm! Not only does it work in all my emulators and a hand full of games, it functions as a mouse. I get a kick out of this. After a year and a half I can finally get some use out of it. Also, ignore the app, it is pointless.
0316069434|3.0|Harry has never been Mr Popularity but since coming back to the force after his retirement he seems to like no one and no one likes him.  That's OK, but the case he is called upon to solve is from 20 years ago, during the Rodney King riots, and it's one in which Harry himself was a witness.  Right away I didn't buy it, not exactly.  Seemed like too much of a coincidence.  I mean, come on.  Harry was right there on the scene and met all of the killers and he didn't have a clue.  twenty years later, I figured it out in no time, and I'm terrible at this sort of thing.  But soon as I heard about a pleasure party of demented Desert Storm vets on a boat, I could see it all.<br /><br />What I didn't expect was how Harry cracked the case wide open on the slightest of clues.  The case could have gone any way, but he settled on Stanislaus County as the center of evil, and so it is.  He figures out who is the weak link in the chain, and he has three hours to break it, and he does.  None of this is the least bit plausible.  Why are people giving this one five star reviews, I don't understand?  Connelly used to be great, but by now he has forgotten about characterization.  I can't remember all the women in his sad old life, forgot about Hannah, forgot about where he got his daughter from, though dimly I remember something about Las Vegas, and the whole daughter plot about who bought the beer for Harry is like something out of Who's the Boss or Family Matters.<br /><br />I smell a new romance in Harry's life, though.  He's older than Clint Eastwood by now but he still scores with the tough chicks.  In the meantime he has made an enemy of the Tool, the Kevin Spacey-like assholeboss who hates him with a passion because of his own inferior weakness.  O'Toole sees only numbers, not the \\"cases and faces\\" that motivate Harry, who grows more phlegmatic every year.  Starting now, I'm on O'Toole's side.
1401235417|5.0|Batman The new 52 Court of Owls read it was unable to put it down after i started best batman i have read in a long time can not wait for vol 2
1594202842|5.0|Ok, I read the WSJ article about this book, read the comments on Amazon and was determined to read the book. Two favourite notes from the book; nothing is fun until you are good at it and if you don't win anything, there really is nothing for you to be humble about.<br /><br />The best thing about the book it shows a mother's dedication and actions to help her children succeed. Do people actually realise it takes lots of love, devotion and care to work at excellence in a child? Is it not more convenient for parents to let tv, video games and sports do the parenting?<br /><br />If I could only spend half as much time and dedication as Amy did shown with her two children, I would have achieved a lot with my two boys. Each child is different but they all need to be pushed and encouraged to excellence. The easy route is always the default route, even the bible says that.<br /><br />This book is a good read for people who are interested in knowing about how to do well by their kids.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|The lightest of the Jane Austen revivals, it's thoroughly charming.  Visually bright and cleverly directed.  Gwyneth is lovely and perfect for the role - a bit too sure of herself, but reflective enough to see her faults.  Jeremy Northam is dreamy as Knightley and believable as a foil to Emma.  The supporting cast is full of treasures (Sophie Thompson and Juliet Stevenson stand out).  It all works and the music scenes are terrific.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|It's the usual for this type of game, neither more nor less. Some objects couldn't be found without a hint because they were obscured by the frames on the game. But, it passes the time.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Although I question Gwyneth's Oscar, she was delightful in all her roles.  Unfortunately, Joseph Fiennes hasn't matched this since, but I'm hopeful.  A knowing, witty, delightful, and charming screenplay with a game cast make this work and it's ultimately affecting.  A very creative take on Romeo & Juliet.
B000HC2PCM|3.0|the hag was supposed to have jesus take a hold i couldnt see songs listed i feel like i was mislead
B00006DEFA|4.0|Although over-the-top, this is a marvelously entertaining version of the play.  Unfortunately, many of the particular incidents portrayed in the film are not historically accurate, but as long as one keeps in mind that this is not a biography, but rather a not-so-quiet meditation on the difference between talent and genius. it's a colorful and enjoyable romp.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|The feat of shooting at something over a mile and being able to hit it with one shot is pure talent!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|While slow-paced and with little action, let alone dialogue, it's a very sad story of thwarted love, universal, and not just the &#34;gay cowboy&#34; story it was marketed as.  Unable to be together, but unable to be themselves apart, it can apply to any type of relationship.  Seeing the movie in the theater, I was left feeling somewhat disappointed, as if there should have been more.  Although I thought it was excellent and that Ang Lee had once again captured a place and time so well (and without the usual movie-cliche' touchstones) that despite how foreign it may be to me personally, it seemed very real.  However, as I left the theater I felt rather numb and by the time I got to the subway at the corner, I burst into tears.  Every time I thought about the movie over the next few days, which was frequently, I did again.  I could not say why at the time, but there was something very, very deep in this movie that went to my soul.  When I purchased the DVD, I did so partly as an experiment to see how I'd react seeing it again.  I was a puddle of tears almost immediately and was so for quite a few more viewings.
B00122J3S0|5.0|I love almost everything Michael Bible sings.  His smooth style and passion for the music make every performance a special event.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|Dreamy, romantic, poetic, and beautiful.  I've always been at a loss to understand what people saw to dislike here.  Perhaps the leads are not conventional, but two of the best actors around make their passion believable.  Oh, and the other actors are among the best around as well.  To describe it as &#34;love knows no boundaries&#34; doesn't do it justice.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed reading and the action and think it gives a good sense of what it means to be in prison, but the end was less ellaborated than in previous novels by the author.
0790734850|5.0|A complex police story, brilliantly told, demonstrating that everone has their price, their own degree of corruption.  The cast is great with the exception of Danny DeVito, who seems to be visiting from another movie.  I even liked Kevin Spacey, so Curtis Hanson must have known what he was doing.  Despite a very cynical theme, it's surprisingly uplifting.
B003TTJ55U|5.0|JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THESE LADIES..... MISS U WISTERIA LANE..... I got into this show 6 mos after the series finale and MAN am I hooked.
B00005MP58|5.0|The best screen version of one of the most delightul books ever written.  Although I found the palette of ochres and browns a bit dreary, it's otherwise a lively, charming, and truly romantic version of what is usually described as a &#34;comedy of manners&#34;.  It's so much more than that, for Austen's genius was in showing human interactions through how they related to personal expectations as well as mere social conventions.  What works especially well here is how you view Darcy through Elizabeth's eyes and how her opinion of him evolves.  One of the most beautiful, romantic, and almost erotic scenes ever is the look they exchange when she covers for the startled Georgiana at the piano when Miss Bingley makes an ignorant jibe at Elizabeth, unknowingly injuring Georgiana.  It would be lost on lesser actors, but Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth do wonders in that little moment.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|great show...was skeptical to watch a zombie show but the characters and morale dilemas they're faced with is very entertaining
0800141660|5.0|A great adaptation of what can sometimes be somewhat dreary.  Although Hugh Grant is and odd choice for Emma Thompson, he's good and she's outstanding.  Her screenplay was meant for Ang Lee to direct.  The supporting cast is almost uniformly perfect as are all the costume drama elements.  Not a bad moment to be seen.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Boring, too many names and characters, keep putting it down, can't get into it. Read 200 pages and i'm only 46% done. Want to finish it but can't get into it.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|the bourne legacy,  lots of acion, and thougt jeremy renner was great. i just have to learn when i want to take a break to pause and not stop,

B00AE2LJVS|3.0|For a true story it leaves you wondering...Really??<br />People get hurt, people die, nothing happens. Stills are smashed and closed everywhere except for one place. Everyone seems to know where it is except the crooked cop.<br /><br />I was disappointed.

B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I hated it .it stinked .i thought it was horrible because the teddy bear was cursing all the time.do not watch this movie at all.even the kids were cursing. I'm just saying don't watch it at all.i thought the movie was bad because as soon as the movie started I just hated it!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I started reading. I was hooked immediately and the writers character development was captivating. I kept wanting more and was constantly surprised. It's everything a book should be. I read obsessively until I finished. I'm going to read many other Gillian Flynn books.
B009A87ZKG|5.0|First class screenplay, performances and film direction.  It also follows the historical chronology pretty well. A great way to teach a kid about WW2 - perhaps the last truly moral war America ever fought.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed this book but would not give it 5 stars.  I actually enjoyed the beginning, and middle more so than the end.  I would give the first 2/3rds 5 stars.  I feel it \\"wrapped\\" up in a rather hurried manner, rushed in the end.  I would have rather seen more attention devoted to the last \\"part\\" of the book. (yes I do realize the omnibus is made up of 5 novels but I feel it was more like a 3 part story......just my opinion).  I believe the author will enjoy great success and applaud his talent.  I'll be exploring some of his other books that  I've recently purchased and hope to at lease enjoy them as much as I did Wool Omnibus edition.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! What a fantastic novel! As we follow a couple through some tense moments, we find it difficult to believe that something like this could actually happen. Yet, on the other hand, considering the minute detail that DeMille has included, you end up believing that you are actually there in Yemen with them; and getting scared along with them. And worrying about your life along with them--especially when you finally learn just exactly who your enemy is. &#34;The Panther?&#34; Maybe... Definitely a major page turner. So-o-o, quickly boot out of this review and find &#34;The Panther&#34;  as soon as possible. You will NOT be disappointed. Charles Reap ReadAReap.Com
034580404X|1.0|Virgin college grad meets incredibly handsome rich guy. Gee, there's a plot line I've never encountered. Except for the sex scenes, this is every Danielle Steele, Harlequin romance, and Lifetime movie ever written. I couldn't believe Ana is actually a college grad; she is very immature. Yet, for a virgin, she was incredibly adept at sex. I read all 3 books, hoping that she would mature, but she didn't. I have nothing against this type of fantasy, if that's what you like. And I certainly don't have a problem with sex or porn. But this series was way over-hyped. And I'm embarrassed that I bought into it.

B009186E3O|1.0|Why can't the Stones release the audio cd's at a reasonable price. Why must you have to spend 70 bucks to hear songs from almost 50 years ago ? So many reviews are about the dvd's. I can see all the stones video i like on you tube. The 2009 remasters are a joke . The Grrr hits are all available on better cd compilations . They finally release something that maybe worth a listen and it's 70 bucks. So typical of this corporation.
B00344EAFA|3.0|Leo is wild in this movie. The blu-ray release seemed random but Leo is a star so why not. The gf had a crush on the guy so I bought this to satisfy my need for edgy cinema while entertaining the misses
0307719219|3.0|The authors look at the political and economic institutions of nations throughout the world. They claim that \\"extractive\\" institutions disfavor economic growth, while \\"inclusive\\" institutions promote growth. Yep, I buy it. But there are other factors that determine economic growth as well, right? Yet the authors blindly insist that institutions are the only things that matter. I found this mindboggling. This book would benefit from peer review -and perhaps from different authors. 3 stars.different points in time! How can two MIT/Harvard economists not see this alternative explanation??? I am puzzled.<br /><br />I found this book worth reading, but I was disappointed by such flawed reasoning, especially from such prominent economists. I was surprised that many of the reviews I read (with the exception of Jared Diamond's review) failed to mention these flaws and instead, took everything at face value. I have seen this book called one of the most insightful economic books in history. REALLY? It would obviously benefit from some kind of peer review. Also, I feel like the authors should refrain from trying to make such sweeping generalizations, when it is likely that none exist.
B001C4CI8A|3.0|Decent movie and the Blu-Ray quality is great. 1080 is the way to go, the only thing we need now are bigger external hard drives

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille never fails to entertain this reader.  The main character of most of his books, John Cory, views the world through a  prism which captures the essence of a situation with a cynical humor.  John's wife/partner, Kate, is a perfect foil for his tough New York City cop perspective. The dialogue between the two is quick witted and droll, leaving the reader smiling even through scenes filled with danger and chaos. Kate is FBI, and prone to following &#34;the plan&#34;. John survives by following his gut, which often puts him in conflict with the rules. Naturally, good triumphs, despite desperate situations and near-death experiences for the main characters.  This book was lots of fun, and hopefully the end of DeMille's writings is not in sight.
0553801473|5.0|My grandson is reading this series. So, had this book on his Christmas wish list. He has been trying to talk me into giving it to him early since the day it came in.
B009B4ZEMA|5.0|Christina is so amazing and her cd is even better! Seller sent this fast! Glad I purchased this...love it! DISREGARD all the BS about how terrible this cd is...she is amazing!
0553386794|5.0|My grandson had read the first 3 books in this series. He borrowed book 1 and purchased books 2 & 3. He put this one on his wish list in order to complete the set.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|Not only do I love Tim McGraw but I loved Gwen can really sing! This movie has a very touching and heart felt connection followed up with great music that will keep you going all the way until the end! High recommend the movie and the cd is superb!
B009LREA1S|3.0|After the second Batman movie I expected a blockbuster and I and my wife were disappointed.  Too much down time.<br />I will watch it again to see if I might change my review.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is by far one of the best vocalists out there. Her saultry voice and pop talent leaves to wanting to listen more!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|The game is great but the ad screen freezes and I have to uninstall and reinstall to play so I lose all the levels I finished already. If that gets fixed I will gladly give 5 stars
B005G4TJUC|5.0|My youngest to my oldest love to pop this movie in. Great visual effects and computer graphics...great theme and very entertaining.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Love this CD.  Played the music at my daughter's wedding reception.  Great compliment to the  wonderful movie.  Purchase it... you will not be disappointed.
0767817478|5.0|Love this movie! Love the updated feel and computer imaging that was put into this movie! A real classic for years to come!
B004IQ78HA|5.0|A classic Disney movie. I rented to get through my daughters tattoo appt. She has a sleeve tattoo of the Alice In Wonderland characters. That day she was getting some characters colored in.
B00005JPFH|4.0|This is a great movie to pop some popcorn and enjoy with the whole family. There is some graphic content so parents beware.
B0013UIUBC|5.0|I have no complaints.  It is a very good movie.  It is pretty sad though.  The acting is good, and it has a good atmosphere.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|This is an amazing album by Onerepublic. Strong vocals and pop charm harmonize this album into a great listening experience!
B009K45Y62|5.0|We pre-ordered this from amazon and got it the day after the release date. There were only about 35,000 of these made and we got number 10,259. The cowl is not life size. It is probably somewhere in the range of 1/3 scale or 1/4 scale. There is no tray on the back of the bat cowl stand, the discs are held in a disc shaped clam shell holder that you can take completely out of the bat cowl stand or store in it. We did not buy the The Dark Knight Trilogy because the packaging for this one was so cool. We are also waiting for the Ultimate Collector's Edition of the trilogy due out in 2013. My wife and I never got to see this in the movie theater, but we both thought it was worth the wait. Just when you thought the Joker was menacing and unpredictable in The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan has made Bane go even further in The Dark Knight Rises. The movie overall, is just great. I have nothing bad to say about it.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|Fun, crazy and is free free. I BEEN PLAYING for hours non stop hopefully my kindle fire won't burn the
B009RI4FRU|4.0|It was a pretty good movie.  I was glad I watched it, but I probably won't buy it.  All the actors did great, the atmosphere is unique, definitely worth watching.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved this book and could hardly wait to finish it but hated the fact that it was the end.  I would really love to read more as I have read all of Kate Morton's books.  Thank you
B000T433CO|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long to watch this movie.  All the actors are great.  The score is by Hans Zimmer, so it's awesome.  The atmosphere is very warm and snugly.  You will probably need some kleenex, so get ready.
030759565X|5.0|Great book,full of easy recipes and fun reading. I have made several of the salads and entrees already and all were great. THe photos are also amazing.
B0000541B2|1.0|The price was good, but I was looking for a controller to use with my playstation 3. I thought that this was one that worked with the ps3. Shipping was okay. The description led me to think it was what I was looking for.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I have heard the phrase \\"hard to put down\\" whe referring to a book, but it is true about this author.  There is always something to keep your interest on every page.<br /><br />A friend told me about Lee Child's Jack Reacher series two weeks ago and I just finished my 4th book.<br /><br />Now there is a movie out with Tom Cruise, who is about 5 foot six playing Reacher who is 6 foot five. Just another Cruise ego trip, but I hear it is pretty good.<br /><br />I'm going to the library to pick up another of Child's book. A bit cheaper than the $9.95 Amazon charges although I did get two of his books on Amazon and it is nice to have books with me on my smart phone.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is fun and atrctive. I love playing it when I feel horde or when I have nothing to do
B003JA5NUA|5.0|If you want to see Billy Burke before Twilight and Revolution....check him at in the Gilmore Girls....very hot!<br />I love the fact you can download just certain episodes!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Because it one of the best book. Most read this book it is very important and lovely please read it it is my pleasure to  tell you about  this  magnificent book
B001H1SVO8|5.0|movie came quickly, great price, no damage, great movie over all really enjoyed it. will be purchasing again. word limit... really?
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  I play HO games for relaxation, and this one was hard enough to be interesting but also not so hard that I was totally baffled as to what to do next.  The few times I got stuck the strategy guide was right there (I didn't have to try to find something on the web), and I got back on track right away. I only had to use hints twice.  The only complaint was that the pictures in the strategy guide were too small to see on my Kindlefire.  Other than that, a very enjoyable, interesting game.  The end was kind of sad, though.  I should mention that I played the regular, not expert version.  Since I play for relaxation, I don't like to have to worry about the time I'm taking.  I will look forward to a part II.
B0086700CM|1.0|I downloaded this to my polaroid tablet and could not play it as the tilt function does not work on the tablet. I also have a zeki tablet and same thing - no tilt mode.  Oh well, at least it was free
B004JQN4WM|4.0|Though it was smaller than I pictured it, I admit, I didn't really look at the dimensions. My son thought it was the best gift he ever got.  He plays with it constantly, and when he's allowed only one toy for a car ride, he always chooses his ankylosaurus.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book, the characters were so real, parts of it were difficult to read because of the content;  but were well written.  I look forward to reading more of this author's books.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Great old tunes, but I'm starting to appreciate the term &#34;digital remastering&#34;.  Item was in great shape and shipped promptly.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I love this game when my sister got it on her ipod I played it and loved it and went to my kindle to be disappointed it wasn't in the store but now I can get it and I'm very happy
B009HEJXFS|5.0|We had a great time watching this movie with our two gradeschool girls.  They have not seen the other films in the series, but enjoyed this one none the less.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Another DVD to add to the growing library... this one was a steal through Amazon. Thanks So Much for offering this great Product
B009O2XY12|4.0|I like it. It's a lot of fun. Easy enough to play. The little bubble creatures are very cute, they make me smile.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this for my grandson back in April 2012 for his birthday. he hasn't complained. It works great. I received it i just 2 days.
1400052173|5.0|This true story was filled with interesting information.  It covered how poor black people have been treated by the mostly white medical establishment.  It examined the complex relationships in a large family some of whom moved from one poor segregated formerly plantation-dominated town to another very different but primarily poor black town in a different but nearby state.  It also explained how one woman's cancer cells could continue to live & divide and spread all over the world of cancer research to this day.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|i totalt love this gsme i can play this all day and night so i realy realt recomend this game to 16 and undder.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very entertaining show with unexpected story changes.  Good acting and many zombiies getting wasted!  The name made me think of the living dead movies many years ago which do not compare.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I Love this series but I feel as if the end petered out. How the characters were just gone and her decision on who she loved was quick and ended the book.
1400049628|5.0|Exactly what my boyfriend wanted in his stocking!  Came here super fast and will be perfect for the family members awaiting the zombie apocolypse.
B009M8TA20|4.0|Oh wow! This was SO different than I expected. It isn't about the Zlatan we see on the pitch. Not at all. It turns out he is very introspective, funny and passionate. He loves his family and actually sounds pretty down to earth- he just happens to be one of the best in the world in a sport that is the best in the world. Of course he is cocky!
B001NTLYKC|4.0|Humble Pie was one of the great blues/rock bands of there time. I did get to see them live in 1973 and this record took me back to that day. If you love live recordings and you don't have this in your collection you need to get it, it will make your day.
B003FM1MNO|4.0|I've been reading the novels, so I thought I'd watch the movies. They're very good if you're interested in this fantasy genre, but they're still a little corny. If you're not interested, you might find them unbearable.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present as she and I both like this show.  Sure she will enjoy it as she has the 1st season.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was so amazing. How a spear of the moment decision of marriage could eventually lead to love. I picked this rating just because I liked the story and I couldn't put it down. Well I could but I didn't want to.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I just love the sound on this CD<br />he is quite talented! reminds me a little of Sam Cooke<br />It's my new favorite
B001HN697M|5.0|I love the Underworld flicks and this is one of my faves.  This is the precursor to the story in the first Underworld film and has a totally different female lead.  A lot of the male actors are the same as in the later (in the timeline) films so the continuity is maintained for fans of the franchise.  I really enjoy female action flicks and this is one of my favorites!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Perhaps the most powerful documentary I have ever seen.  A true must see!  Beautifully told, amazing subject, and surprises at every turn.  If it wern't completely true, you couldn't have made this up
B009X2CVXA|5.0|Good story lines. good writing and well crafted story. lots of detail and the unanswerable mystery left to the end to be revelaed. a hard to put down story.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Beautifuly told story with just enough quirkiness.  My favorite Wes Anderson work- just more fun than the others. Outstanding cast.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|great fun! can animals and humans co-exist? Can religions and humans co-exist? leaves lots of questions only you can answer.Also a very good story of the silliness of religious opinions that yours is the only true one. am looking forward to the film.<br />a story to be read and re -read on many different levels
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I feel like I'm at a cheap amusement park with this game. there is little interest to keep you interested in the game
030758836X|4.0|This book was recommend by a friend of mine. She warned me I would hate the ending. Really got into this book and could not put it down. The wife you want to kill, the husband you feel sorry for. They are both so screwed up-meant for each other. But what the hell is with the ending?? Really, it's like the author didn't know what else to write, so she just ended it. That sucked big time!  I had to go back to the last page and re read it twice because I just could not believe it. I won't read anymore of her books. That just did it for me.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love Preston & Child books, particularly the &#34;Pendergast&#34; series.  While I cannot say &#34;Two Graves&#34; is my favorite Pendergast novel (that still has to be &#34;Still Life With Crows&#34;), it ranks up there in my top 5 Pendergast books.  This book seemed like it took forever to be released (come on publishers!), and I finished it in one day (though I DO read quickly).  I couldn't put it down until I reached the end.  My first thought upon finishing it was, &#34;What comes next?&#34;  I hope this story line is continued in the next Pendergast novel, which hopefully comes out SOON!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Harry Bosch expose -- the best of LA's finest both procedurally and geographically -- Connelly captures it . . . .
B0076DELIG|5.0|Riveting, as all the others are!  Michael Connelly never disappoints and this is no exception.  No disappointment here, ever.  With any of his protagonists.
B006G2124E|5.0|Great movie.  Great performances.  Well worth the money I paid.  I will definitely buy more movies from Amazon instant video.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I loved this series.  Couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend it.  I loved the characters and storyline. Well written and fast-paced suspense.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is another great one.... Will probably have to buy it as we enjoy it that much... go pigs
