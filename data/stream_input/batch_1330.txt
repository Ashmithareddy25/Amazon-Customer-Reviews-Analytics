B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I ordered this post Christmas 2011. It came in lighting fast via UPS, thanks to Amazon.com. The MicroShell Folio fit to my son's kindle is snug, the feel is smooth and non-abrasive, and the opening and closing is easy. It is just what we needed for the kindle.
B003Q6D25U|4.0|With a much bigger (if still small by Hollywood standards) budget than the excellent original, this upstart does it again. We discover that this is really a prequel that sets the stage for the who, why and when all this ghostly stuff occurs. We move beyond the young couple in \\"1\\" and here see a complete family unit. A father on his second marriage - with a teenage daughter in tow - his new wife and their newborn son. After strange sounds and events begin the couple installs strategically placed cameras throughout the house. This of course is how we see all the spooky stuff...but not any physical beings...until the end. Plenty of gotchas of course, but genuinely creepy. Stillllllll! At some point don't you call 911?<br /><br />This 2 disc combo pack includes the theatrical version and an unrated version which includes 7 minutes of \\"found footage.\\" Also it includes an unrated DVD version as well as a digital copy.  All presented in glorious DTS-HD Master Audio in addition to Dolby Digital 5.1.

B004A8ZWWY|3.0|Maybe the best thing about this traditional heist movie is that Eddie Murphy returns in something other than slapstick schlock.  Granted, his is not the good performance he had in \\"Dreamgirls\\" but it surpasses most of the fare he's been associated with recently.  The film is pretty standard stuff along the lines of the \\"Oceans\\" series.  Not as good as the best but certainly better than the worst.  Hotel manager Josh (Ben Stiller) decides to go after a Madoff-like bizillionaire investor, played by Alan Alda, after he loses all of Josh's money along with the entire hotel staff.  Josh enlists several of the staff members to help him as well as parolee Slide (Murphy) who Josh knew from grammar school.<br /><br />Shaw (Alda) is believed to have a large sum of money hidden somewhere in the hotel/residence (played by Trump Tower) where he lives.  It turns out it's not cash, jewelry or bonds but something less obvious and in plain sight.  The movie does have some very funny lines, many of which are delivered not my Murphy but by Matthew Broderick in his role as accomplice, Mr. Fitzhugh, an evicted tenant and former broker.  The final act however goes beyond the laws of reasonability and becomes ridiculous.  Overall the film is a pleasant time waster and not much else.<br /><br />Although this film is mildly entertaining, the transfer to Blu ray is top notch.  It is in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio and looks great.  Even the small details are evident.  The colors are good.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 is equally impressive.  The speakers really come to life in the final sequence.  Extras include a director's commentary, 2 alternate endings, several deleted/altered scenes, a gag reel, a couple behind the scenes featurettes and more.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|The only thing that made me unhappy about upgrading from an ancient and unsupported Palm Treo 680 to an Android device was the lack of calendars comparable in look and functionality to the Palm calendar, which was unquestionably the best mobile calendar I've ever used.  This is the first one I don't utterly hate. The interface looks good, functionality and visibility is great, and everything syncs through Google to my Pimlical desktop calendar. If there was a desktop version of this, I'd junk Pimlical in a heartbeat.  I have only one tiny quibble - that, in order to see one category/Google calendar at a time, I must darken all the others manually. I'd like to have a tap or pulldown function to select a single category for visibility rather than for invisibility. But it's a small thing, really. Otherwise I'm finally happy.  Now if only somebody would do something for contacts ... *sigh*.

B005QBKXOQ|1.0|Okay, Chris we know you can sing the sappy \\"Love Songs\\". You have demonstrated that far too often. I was once again hoping this album would be more along the style(s) of your debut. WRONG!!! With the exception of Renegade, there are no rockers. The rest of them, I have heard on all of your previous releases, just different words. The same beat, same story line, I mean.....C'Mon Man! As one of your biggest fans when you were on Idol, and was in the front of the line to get your debut, I can state that once again I am unimpressed. Although I have about worn out your debut CD, this one will go into the rack to collect dust with the others. I guess from now on, instead of pre-ordering, I will wait, listen to samples, then buy songs singley.

B006W5JF9Y|2.0|Some of these covers are wonderful (Avett Bros./Johnny Cash, Adele, Sting, Carolina Chocolate Drops, Elvis Costello), but the vast majority of these songs are intolerable (Ke$ha and whoever it is that butchers \\"Song to Woody\\" immediately come to mind). At least the proceeds go to charity, but I'm not sure that excuses all of these bubblegum pop musicians taking some of the greatest songs ever written and reworking them into radio-friendly (and sometimes even club friendly) pop tunes.

B000ATQYT2|2.0|There is no question that this movie is a well-written and well-directed re-make of Charles Dickens' classic.  However I am used to The Muppets' TV shows and other movies being very, very funny.If a lot of light-heartedness is what you are expecting from this film, you will be disappointed and maybe caught off guard.If you are sad/depressed during the winter holidays and think that this film will lift your spirits- no, it probably won't.It has a few scenes that will make you laugh.Much of this movie, though is a very grim,in-your-face, reminder of real life situations that we often  hope to escape briefly during the winter holidays, such as being trapped in an abusive workplace,of having a child with a serious medical problem from which they may not recover,or of the crushing agony of a broken love affair or marriage.Additionally the scene in the desolate,deserted cemetery is quite a bit longer than it needs to be for a Muppets movie.  The music is beautiful, but some of the selections are about such excruciating,bone-scraping pain that I doubt they would even be appropriate for a funeral.  Yes, the original Dickens classic is partly about the above-mentioned, painful situations.Yet I have seen extremely lighthearted renditions of this play done very well by other performers and there is no reason that The Muppets couldn't have lightened the tone of this considerably.  If one wants to see a very funny re-make of this movie that still manages to make a strong point and touch viewers' hearts,I recommend instead, \\"Scrooged\\" from 1988.  If one wants to see the subject matter of the play taken more seriously, perhaps the original version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" would be a more emotionally uplifting choice than \\"The Muppets' Christmas Carol.\\"
B000FVE3A2|5.0|I have bought many things in my life and have appreciated as well as regretted the purchase. It is very seldom that one can buy something and feel you got more than what you paid.  This watch for me was a very good purchase. I have been looking for a decent Automatic watch and even considered getting a Tag at one point. Then my need for a new surfboard brought me back down to reality. I searched and searched and although there were several choices of automatics in the Invicta line, the Grand Diver was just the right size, look, and price was unbelievable.  Thus far, I have gotten several compliments and double takes. I currently have a TAG Kirium and have never gotten the reaction. I think the size has a lot to do with it.  The only thing i would love more is if they made a chrono auto version of this and sold it at a price comparable to this watch. The only thing I could find was the 6892 which was 6 times more expensive.  Value = 10  Style = 8 (chrono would be better)  Build = 8.5 (everything lines up well, not perfect but way better than a $140 watch should)
B005LJK3AC|1.0|I rented this movie as the trailer looked cute, it was so vulgar that we could not watch more than 10 minutes! I do not know anyone who swears as much as they have on this movie.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|I thought I would try a magazine on my Galaxy Tab 7 Plus to see if it was worth the subscription price. (National Geographic) Luckily I only purchased one magazine and not the whole subscription. I figured that since both the Kindle Fire and the Galaxy Tab 7 Plus were both Android I would get the same experience as Kindle Fire. I was wrong. I appears that the Kindle Fire as a different Kindle app than what is available for Android tablets and the Kindle Fires gets all the pictures with the articles where the Android app does not. It appears that the Android version only gets a few of the pictures but the the Kindle Fire gets all that are included in the original article. There really should be no reason for this since the Kindle Fire is Android based. Because of this, it is a deal breaker for me to cancel my regular magazine subscription to National Geo Graphic and going with the e-Mag.  With the exception of the magazine experience, Kindle for Android is excellent. But could use a few more improvements to give a full Kindle experience that the Kindle Fire has.  I understand that the Kindle Fire is Amazon's own creation and the \\"Kindle\\" experience will be slightly different than with it's stand alone apps. But watering down content is not something that I would expect in a magazine subscription. It should be equal across the board in that regards.
0375507256|5.0|Cloud Atlas is an ingenious and ambitious book.  As other reviewers have explained, the book is structured like a pyramid, with five half-stories, each tenuously connected, rising up to the acme, where a single story provides the book's climax, and following which each of the prior five stories is completed, in reverse order, on the way down.  What I most enjoyed about the book was Mitchell's take on the evolution of language, as a reflection of the culture and morals of a society.    The first story takes place in the mid-19th century, and the language is an older version of our modern English, replete with spellings and turns of phrase no longer in use.  Slavers and the enslaved are classified by strict class divides, by racial and tribal differences and pre-conceived notions.  In the subsequent stories, each set in a later time period, the language and references evolve accordingly, but the circumstances are recognizable. The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish brings the reader to the present time period, and then the next two stories go forward from there.  I am not a science fiction fan, and usually dislike stories set in the future, but in this case, I found that the evolution of the language to suit the future settings was fascinating.  In An Orison of Somni-451, one only has to imagine a world taken over by Korea following a few generations of texting to understand how the new language and customs came about.  In the pinnacle story, the language has devolved even further, but as the reader tackles it, the language again brilliantly reflects the time and circumstances.    What goes around comes around.  In each story, there is a power struggle, and the battle of the weak versus the strong, the real versus the clone, the empowered versus the enslaved.  Each story suggests reincarnation, or perhaps a hall of mirrors where one cannot be certain which is the real one, and which is just a somewhat distorted version.  A particularly good example was in the secondhalf of The First Luisa Rey Mystery, the music of Robert Frobisher, protagonist of Letters from Zedelgehm, is revealed to be titled the \\"Cloud Atlas Sextet,\\" a work structured identically to the novel.    Cloud Atlas was a challenging read, but well worth the investment.

B005LAJ1O0|4.0|I gotta say, American Horror Story was an interesting show with an original concept. I like horror movies, shows, and stories, and AHS kept me watching week after week. It's definitely a series to start at the begining, and try not to miss any episodes so you are not left in the dark. I can't say every episode was a homerun, but they were all well above average considering our reality littered tv landscape nowadays. The entire concept is not meant to go season after season, so be prepared for this storyline to be finished and a new cast and location is supposed to start season 2. I thought the actors/actresses all did fine jobs, with a few standout performances (Lange and Peters in particular). The show does end with some questions, but it reminds me more of short stories that leave enough of a thread open so that the reader can think of their own ideal way for the story to wrap up. The writers did a great job of answering most questions, and the series ends solidly enough that I wasn't left feeling cheated. I don't know that I would buy the whole season (not sure how many multiple viewings it would get), but it is at the very least worth renting and watching.
B005UKJX4E|2.0|Weird, dissonant, over-achieving. Probably appeals to those who view the film as existential art attempting to answer the meaning of life. Felt like I was watching an unexplained, long episode of \\"Nature\\" or \\"Nova\\". The only redeeming factor that kept me from turning this off was the mesmerizing cinematography and CGI.
B0069GRIHW|3.0|I rank LA Woman as one of Rock's great swan-song albums (along with Skynyrd's \\"Street Survivors\\"). Top to bottom, front to back, just a great recording. From the wonderful opening fat funk base line of \\"The Changeling\\" to oh so smooth ethereal fade-out of \\"Rider's On The Storm\\", this album has hardly a weak spot in it. Morrison's raspy vocals - raw and, at times, weary - serves as a great counterpoint to what he delivered on their eponymoous debut: strong, clean and youthful.<br /><br />What is so disappointing with this release is how lackluster the presentation is. At first I thought that there wasn't any liner notes or booklet was included. It took a while for me to find it in the center fold section. As already noted, the booklet has a few pics of the band recording and a nice little review by David Fricke. Big Deal. Granted, the price is reasonable. Even so, you'd think that they'd celebrated the occasion of the essential classic rock albums a little more definitively than this (see ROLLING STONES: \\"Some Girls\\" or \\"Exile On Main Street\\",PINK FLOYD: \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here\\"). Gawd! There is a cheesy bonus CD include that features forgetful alternative takes of several of the songs along with a couple of the infamous \\"previously unreleased tracks that sport some pretty poorly recorded vocals (for gawd's sake turn the gain down!). So there's nothing really to get excited about here. The Bonus CD is more useful as a drink coaster than anything worthy of a spin in CD player. The Doors do have a horrible track record with reissues of this particluar album; some where they tried to tweak the original mixes and ended up just butchering the tracks! At least this reissue didn't try and tweek the original mixes as stayed true to original release.<br /><br />So while the album itself is a 5-star-stuck-on-a-desert-island-essential, this reissue only rates 3 stars because of failure to meet expectations. The price is right for a first time purchase, it's just the extra's, overall package, etc aren't up to the occasion. Poor Job Done! If you already have a copy, don't bother with this one.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way - am I just being dense here or aren't we a year late for the 40th anniversay of this recording's release? (Actually 9 months). It was released April 1971. Wow!! Guess they really did take a lot of LSD back then. Couldn't get year or the month right. Too many nights in the Soul Kitchen, eh bro?overall package, etc aren't up to the occasion. Poor Job Done! If you already have a copy, don't bother with this one.

1401229921|5.0|I am not going to review the Hush story itself.  If you are looking to buy this book for the story, I would recommend getting the real graphic novel full of great inking and colors.  This book is for those who have read the story and are interested in the artwork of Jim Lee or artwork in general.  This book is fantastic at showing not only the great lines of Jim Lee's work, but the comic artwork process as well.  I never realized how good a job inkers and colorists do until I saw Jim Lee's artwork.  I'm not saying Jim lee's work needs inkers and colorists, because te work it gorgeous.  But when you compare the work side by side and is interesting how good a job they do.<br /><br />As for the book itself, if you want to see the original pencil work, then here it is in all of its glory.  You can see (in my opinion) a better view of how Jim Lee set up each panel.  Which parts he put a lot of effort into and which he left for the inkers and colorists to fill out.  For example, if it should be black, Mr Lee did not shade it in, he just placed an x in the location.  What this does it give more white coloring than darker shading - not what I was expecting.  I loved every page.<br /><br />I had two nitpicks:<br />1) The book is tightly bound.  And since the story is a lot of issues of comics, there are some pages where you just can't get a good look at the full panel.  I felt like I should break the binding just to get a better view of the pencil work.  The Hush colored version I have is two graphic novels and was easier to see the internal parts.  I'm not sure if the single edition of Hush has this same issue.  It does mean the book is good quality, but I would have liked to have gotten a better view of some pages.<br /><br />2) Some drawn lines seemed blacker than I would have expected from pencil.  This could mean that Mr Lee used multiple pencils (one very tight point that draws a deep black and one that looks more normal pencil color and is a little thicker) or it could be part of the copy process which maybe darkened some lines.  It looked to me as if some parts were penciled and some parts had a little ink (usually more noticeable in background buildings or when Mr Lee had drawn some technical device that had a lot of detail).  Or it might just be my eyes.<br /><br />In any case, I highly recommend this book.h maybe darkened some lines.  It looked to me as if some parts were penciled and some parts had a little ink (usually more noticeable in background buildings or when Mr Lee had drawn some technical device that had a lot of detail).

1451648537|5.0|This excellent biography was a real eye-opener! I can see how devotees of Steve Jobs could get upset and defensive with Walter Isaacson's portrayal of their hero. Like many others, I bought the carefully scripted and crafted public image of Jobs while he was still with us -- genius, visionary, creator. But this book shows the dark, disturbing 'other side' of this complicated, not-very-happy man. He was quite often tyrannical, cruel, vindictive, abusive, petty, and even bizarre. He appeared to be a dreadful man to work for, given his scary, arrogant temperment and unpredictability. Half of the time, he seemed completely unlikeable -- given to judging people unfairly and deliberately making them miserable, under the twisted guise of 'making them work harder and smarter.' (What kind of example does this offer young people regarding real leadership, character, and ethics?) I'm surprised that none of Jobs' family or few close friends or co-workers ever suggested that he get some sort of psychotherapy for his many dysfunctionalities! Plus, the technicians and workers at Apple and Pixar should get the much larger share of the credit for their marvelous, innovative products and successes -- credit that Jobs grabbed mostly for himself. (I should also note that Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Microsoft's Bill Gates come across as much more balanced and reasonable people in Isaacson's research, by way of contrast to Steve Jobs.) I'll be further analyzing this captivating biography with my library Book Club soon! Thanks, Walter...
B005VTGB0S|3.0|I have few iPad 2 cases and I use them for different reasons. My default one has a bleutooth keyboard, which is nice for typing but not really for watching videos. I have a green one that attaches like a magnet which makes it a little more portable, but also isn't really that great for videos.  This AmazonBasics case is the best iPad I've found for watching videos. It's by far the most adjustable case I own, so you won't run into any glare problems with this case. I found that it works well with almost every surface.  There are some downsides to this case though. Typing isn't as easy as it could be, even on the front notch. You have to be careful with how hard you type because you might push the iPad back. I'm also cautious with how much I would trust this case to protect my iPad while traveling.  I wish this case was a little cheaper so I could fully recommend it as a video watching case. But with the price it has now, I can't really justify it as a purchase. Some iPad cases are pretty pricey, but they are meant to protect a very expensive product. You might want to invest a little more money in a case.
B004H7QICG|2.0|I can't give it any lower than 2 stars, as it's a very well-built case, and is backed by years of reviews.  Unfortunately, as is hinted by the \\"years of reviews\\", the design is too dated, and for the repeated, non-stop disappointments, ultimately leading to another case purchase, I can't give it more than 2 stars.  As others have mentioned, there is no USB 3.0 header, so in order to make use of the front USB 3.0 port, you must drag a USB 3.0 cable with the A Male plug straight out the back of the case onto one of the motherboard's external port.  This is possibly the most inelegant thing I've seen in years.  Minus 0.5 star.  The v183v3 places its PSU on the bottom, and relies on power cables to be routed behind the motherboard.  This is not an entirely new concept, and it's perfectly fine.  Unfortunately, cable management is less than ideal, as they force all cables through a 1\\" choke point in the middle of the case, which forces all cables to *not* take a direct path.  Most other cases have a wide-open area under the motherboard for direct runs.  This resulted in the CPU power (P4/8pin) cord from an OCZ Modular 700W PSU not reaching, and I had to buy an extension cable.  Minus 0.5 star.  Once I moved on to install the 2 SSD's, I found that the SSD's would only fit in the center 2x3.5\\" hard drive cage, as the other 4x3.5\\" slots were designed to only mount drives from the side.  For some strange reason, Antec only included 4 screws for 2.5\\" drives, so I was forced to install 2 SSD's with 2 screws each.  I can't use regular screws, as I have to use the extra-long screws that are compatible with their silicone dampers, which are really unnecessary, as SSD's have no rotational parts.  Minus 0.5 star.  I then moved onto the GPU's, and found that any modern-day, 11-13 inch GPU would not fit in the case without removal of the center, 2x3.5\\" hard drive cage.  Trust me, I was speechless.  For the price Antec charges, they must certainly assume that they would attract Enthusiasts, and that they would purchase a full-sized GPU, right?  Well, unfortunately, the only way I could get a single GeForce GTX in there was to pull the center 2x3.5\\" hard drive cage, and end up with 2 SSD's on my desk.  Are you kidding me?  Minus 1 star.  So now I'm down to 4x3.5\\" slots from 6x3.5\\" slots, and my 2 SSD's need a new home.  I open the box of my OCZ Vertex 3 SSD's, and find that they only included short 3.5\\" adapters -- meaning, they are designed to use the two, adjacent screw holes in a standard, 3.5\\" slot.  While this would not be a problem for a normal case with 3 screw holes on the side, the Antec v183v3's 4x3.5\\" hard drive cage only has the two, outer end screws, so I can't use the bundled OCZ adapters.  Minus 0.5 star.  I reach for my Icy Dock Dual SSD adapter (MB990SP-B) in an effort to solve this issue and to also save a hard drive slot, and of course, it, too, relies on the two, adjacent screw holes in a standard, 3.5\\" slot.  It turns out that many of the 2.5\\" to 3.5\\" adapters are of the short variety, and I ended up wasting some time before I found one that was full length and would hold 2 SSD's.  So finally, the system is built.  However, by this time, I'm realizing that I am now stuck with a high-end system that can only support 2 SSD's and 3 hard drives.  This does not make me very happy, as I have 4 hard drives sitting on my desk.  I realize I could purchase a 2-slot 5.25\\" hard drive cage that takes 3x3.5\\" drives, but once I see the price tag of $150 on such an item, I realize I'm far better off paying that same price for an Antec P280 that has *NONE* of the limitations that the v183v3 has for effectively the same price.  If you're only planning on using 1 or 2 hard drives and on-board video, this would make an excellent, silent case for you.  The build quality is excellent, acoustics well-thought-out, and looks great.  A bit large for a HTPC, but a lot more quiet than a tiny-case HTPC.  If you are planning for a high-end system, overclocking, SLI/Crossfire, and 4+ hard drives, look elsewhere.  I ended up getting an Antec P280.  Same price, *none* of the issues mentioned above -- except it wasn't available when I purchased the v183v3.  Hope this helps someone...

B004SUWR2C|1.0|stupidest app ever why is it in the amazon app store if its not compatible for the kindle fire unless you whant to give up80 mega bytes stupid I shan't my money back or amazon could get rid of the 80 mega bytes
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I LOVE the you version Bible. I like how it reads to you and how you can manage your devotions and Bible time. the only negative thing about this app is that , with the kindle fire, you cannot use it without Internet access. the place I go to youth group is at a house who does not have wireless so I cant use it there.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it because it has a lot of games and some are hard and some are fun and some are easy

1904994768|1.0|I was really excited about getting this book and once I opened it, I quickly discovered that this was NOT what I was hoping it would be!  If you're looking for \\"records\\" such as \\"Best-selling LIPS track\\" or \\"First Xbox 360 Movie Karaoke Game\\" then you're in LUCK!  And yes,...those ARE, in fact, actual records included in this book.  You can find records of best scores and such, but they are included at the very end and are hardly even recognized.  All in all, I should've sent the book back, but maybe my 9 year old nephew will like it?!
B005TPSBIE|1.0|Everything else works on my TV - the home theater, the cable, the other stuff I get via Roku - but not the HD video from Amazon.  Amazon has no answer - they give me a generic reply that is meaningless.  None of their HD gives any sound.  At least they did give a refund.  How annoying.

In particular she cites DeMarco and Lister's Coding War study where the authors demonstrated that developers who had privacy were more productive. What is missing is the circumstances around it. DeMarco and Lister weren't studying teams and so the results don't speak to teams.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I slipped my Kindle Fire into the elastic bands and it is a nice snug fit.  I love the soft tan leather cover that is so classy.  I got it to close properly just by placing a nice large hard back on top of it whenever it was not in use.  The 'new' scent was a little unpleasant, but it soon went away.  Heartily recommend the cover!

(And Steve was extremely picky)  I had to read this cover to cover in a matter of a few days - OK, it was more like a week.  My wife is now reading it - she wants to see what I was so excited about! Highly recommended!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I was a Xbox 360 owner from day one, I was brand loyal. After three consecutive years where may 360 had the RROD at the same time of year I was out. The PS3 was the only real alternative, so I jumped in, for the most part I was pleased, but the PS3 controller was uncomfortable to say the least, I hated the thing with a passion.  I ordered up this little controller and straight out of the package it felt great, felt familiar. After charging it up I synced it up with my PS3, no problems. I have used my controller now for a couple of weeks, no problems at all, battery life seems to last a bit longer than the PS3, and I am using this much more than I ever used the PS3 controller. If and when this dies, I'll buy another.  Only negative is that you cannot power up the PS3 with this, what a shame, I have to get out of my recliner....call it exercise!
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I love the details on the cover. It looks so pretty and its not plain. The only thing that could make this better is if it could stand like all the other covers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Pretty good game for free. Once you get past a few stages they get harder to unlock levels since the point requirement is so high. Its still playable and worth the 0 price tag. I would download more.

B005HSG3U6|4.0|I was a little wary of this product based on the reviews but ordered it anyway. Today it arrived and I feel that it is perfect. It seems rather sturdy but light and sleek but stylish. I tried the stand feature and to my surprise it stayed right up no matter how much I disturbed it. Also the contrast of the white back and black front really suited my taste. Lastley the rubber-plastic material doesn't seem \\"cheap\\" at all but strong and tight to the Kindle instead. Only problem is that the cover's inside felt material picks up EVERYTHING it touches. Overall very pleased.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Excellent app, easily kills all programs.  I use it for my Kindle Fire AND my Evo Design, and used it for my Samsung Moment.
B001IBIQU6|1.0|Yes, this record came out almost three years ago, and I still have a bloodlust. Yes, I've got all the whiny DM classicist fan trappings, and the influence of their classic material on my listening habits makes me an unobjectionably biased reviewer. But, come on guys, something has to change. Get it together. Depeche Mode have completely lost their way, and forgotten everything about what makes their music work, while genuinely seeming to believe that they've never sounded better.<br /><br />I really thought Depeche had figured out how to save a sinking ship by taking the route they initially did after Alan's departure, and after Daniel Miller stopped messing about internally. \\"Ultra\\" and \\"Exciter\\" largely still sounded vital and becoming of Martin's songwriting strengths, while leaning heavily on the unmistakable styles of the respective producers they collaborated with, in order to forge a new plan for continuing their careers into the future and into a comfortable old age. \\"Ultra\\" sounded like maybe a Seal, Madonna or Bjork record of the mid-90's, back when it was cool to have a hybrid rock-band/electronic sound palette with string sections and stuff. And the sober, vocally-trained Dave never sounded better, technically speaking. \\"Exciter\\" was basically an LFO record with slide guitar, the Bible, sunglasses and tuxedos. That tour had them moving about slowly onstage, but looking old and looking cool doing it.<br /><br />But then this young whippersnapper Ben Hillier (who came into the Playing the Angel project with no advance history of listening to DM... which I wouldn't object to, if it didn't turn out the way it did) seems to think that if he throws a few percolating arpeggiations and thick Moog sweeps like confetti all over a track that he has done NOTHING as a traditional producer to shape and understand and turn into something palatable and coherent and narrative, that that will make it interesting. These songs just plod on and on and on. The chord changes happen at the top of every bar, clock-like, as though they themselves are belabored and bored of the song. No huge repeating hooks, no inspiring, sampler-based sound design to voice soaring contrapuntal instrumental melodies, just totally unprocessed guitar playing half-realized little snippets of phrases and \\"dear Diary\\" lyrics and/or Jesus' disciples references (depending on if Dave or Martin wrote the song) that never end.<br /><br />The fact that the band thinks this music both resembles and stands up to their 1986-1990 material is embarrassing. The album is engineered like garbage, too... it's spectrally muddy, amateurishly mixed and lots of things were tracked clipped (in a lazy and quick sort of way, not in an aesthetically consistent way). There are long stretches mid-song where, just... nothing happens. Lots of little cut-and-paste tidbits of aimless synth wankery peppers the stretches, but everything just slaps against the wall and slides off. It's a really difficult record to get all the way through. It's more ham-handedly executed than the records of all the awful synthpop bands that came out in the 2000's, claiming New Order and DM as their lineage, thinking that a few mailed-in presets from a Microkorg and a Nord Lead 2 were all they needed to capture those bands' essence.<br /><br />I am the younger brother of another rabid DM fan in his 40's, totalling three decades of obsession between us. We left a 2005 Seattle Touring the Angel performance depressed at the inherent sadness of the image of Dave Gahan spinning around in circles with leather pants on. It seems we are in for a future of Depeche Mode records that are unforgivably dull.every bar, clock-like, as though they themselves are belabored and bored of the song.

B006NFKUF6|5.0|Got the free version on my kindle. Thought it was gonna be boring but after the first five seconds I fell in love with it. If you like fighting robots and villains then this is the game for you. The only issue I hav with this app are the controls. Its kind of hard to aim but overall a fun fighting game with awesome comics and graphics.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|This movie was GREAT to me! This movie actually made me like and tolerate Charlotte Bronte's plotting skills for the story-line of Jane Eyre.  Before, I felt she had none.  Being a HUGE fan of classics, I've tried, seriously folks, to palate the Bronte' sisters books and found them as lively as watching paint dry under the influence of prescription cold medicine.  I just can't do it. I've read Jane Austen.  LOVE HER!!!!  I've read Louisa May Alcott, adore her writings and not just Little Women, I also like Little Men, and Jo's Boy's the sequels.  This movie, however, maybe because it may be a departure from her original book, I loved! Don't really know, just my opinion.

B0061TQBRK|4.0|While the band has wisely chosen to return, in part, to the dark, more gothic-leaning composition found on their earlier albums (Comalies and Unleashed Memories), their continued reliance on the latest nu-metal producer-du-jour Don Gilmore makes them sound like a hundred other bands. Pummeling the listener with detuned, Korn-like bass rumblings and double-bass drumming is unnecessary when the composition of the music itself is generally heavy enough. Still, a welcome change for the better. And their continued ability to make a cover song their own (as they did quite admirably with Depeche Mode's \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" and Dubstar's \\"Stars\\") continues here with their interesting take on another huge hit, REM's \\"Losing my religion\\". Whodathunk you could make a heavy, gothic statement with that one?! Additionally, album closer \\"My spirit\\", written as a tribute to former tourmate Peter Steele of Type O Negative, further shows that the band hasn't forgotten it's gothic roots. (And they sure did on the last album Shallow Life, so this is step in the right direction!) Think of this as 35% Comalies and 65% Karmacode.
0446567337|5.0|This is by far my favorite story by Nicholas Sparks, with The Last Song being a close runner up. I actually watched the movie first and fell in love with the actors because they did such a great job portraying all of the emotion this story contains. Since I loved the movie, I got the book. This is the first time I can honestly say that I loved them both the same. The funny thing is there are some significant differences between the two, the ending being the most critical, yet I loved the way the movie ended and I also loved the way the book ended even though they were very, very different. I've never had that experience before.<br /><br />Since this book was entirely in the first person POV of John, the only person's head you are ever in is John's. I think that was one of the things that made the book so poignant for me. It was so decidedly male in regards to the perspective of the story, but in this book Sparks shows a side of men that you can only experience from reading John's internal thoughts. You can't capture that on film, and that was what made the book so powerful.<br /><br />This is a love story in it's purest form and I found it truly inspirational that John gained so much insight and maturity from his relationship with Savannah and their experiences. He learned from the pain as well as the good times, but for John, the painful lessons made him stronger and gave his life another layer to it that he embraced. That was truly inspirational for me. The way John concluded his thoughts about what real love is would make even the toughest of hearts melt. It wasn't sappy either, but truly insightful and touching. If you've never read Sparks before and you want to see some of his best work, start with this one. It's not depressing, but rather hauntingly beautiful, and I loved it!
B005LAIGN2|4.0|It may seem a little strange for George Lucas to self-finance an action movie about the Tuskegee Airmen. But it's a true story with all the hallmarks of an epic tale: downtrodden heroes, lots of adversity, an enemy we love to hate. Red Tails makes for compelling film material.<br /><br />For an epic tale, Red Tails is in many ways narrow in scope. There is little backstory. We begin in Italy, where black airmen are already flying missions. There is little to no information about their backgrounds and training, though it is obvious they are well-educated. There is some story on the ground, enough to keep the film moving and interesting. But it's also cliched and a little cheesy in moments, in the ways you'd probably expect. And that's okay.<br /><br />Take one part Star Wars and one part Top Gun and you've got the feel for the battles in-flight. I am not a big action fan, but I enjoyed them.<br /><br />Red Tails is not going to win many awards. But it's the kind of movie that needs to keep being made. In a nation full of reality television vapidity, Red Tails is a movie that exposes people to true American heroes who embodied excellence and were willing to sacrifice everything for a country all too ready to count them out. The Tuskegee Airmen were men of courage and of faith. This film honors their memory and is the sort of story that inspires and will continue to do so for many years as children watch it for the first time and are inspired to learn more about their history.<br /><br />Lucas has mentioned that as he contemplated the project for over two decades, he eventually envisioned the story as a trilogy (surprise, surprise!) However strange it sounds, I would love to see a prequel made that explains the background and training of the men before they reach Europe. A sequel that shows what happens when they return home would also make a worthwhile film. Though Red Tails does stand alone, it feels incomplete, there is just so much story left to be told.<br /><br />I'd commend Red Tails to you and I think it is more family friendly than the rating (PG-13) implies. The language is pretty clean and the romance is not nearly as racy as 90% of PG-13 movies. The rating is for the violence of war, which is less gruesome in the air than other combat movies.re family friendly than the rating (PG-13) implies.

0743497465|1.0|I am a fan of Dan Brown's unique mixture of adventure, history and suspense in DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons.  While the writing itself was generally workmanlike, his creative, action-driven plots certainly kept me interested and turning pages.<br /><br />No such luck here.  This reads like the worst science fiction/romance novel you have ever not finished.  The plot is ridiculous to anyone who knows the least bit about either science, our government, or Washington D.C.  The writing would make a good high school English teacher cringe.  Brown uses every cliche imaginable at least once.  His characters are largely one-dimensional caricatures - I really  couldn't care about any of them.  And the book is waaay too long.  It is the worst book I have read in several years - I only kept going out of a perverse sense of seeing how much worse it could get!<br /><br />I can only guess that this was his 'practice' or warm-up novel for his later successes.  From that perspective, it might be interesting to hard-core Brown fans simply to see how far he has come in mastering his craft.  But otherwise, please don't waste your time, which may be better spent re-reading The DaVinci Code.

B004QITJC2|4.0|It's hard to believe that Human Remains took thiry years to see the light of day. I never heard any demos  from this band, so perhaps this is a result of Andy Sneaps production (Blood of the nations best metal album in last ten years) and guitar playing.Incredebly heavy. A must have.

B00715RG3Q|3.0|this was once one of my absolute favorite shows.  hugh laurie was an absolute favorite actor.  however, this show is treading water in the same old storylines week after week.  only the diseases change yet they all have in common that they are incredibly esoteric with patients who have messy personal lives as well.  this week's episode involves a man with apparent early alzheimer's.  his wife can't take it anymore and is ready to walk out on him.  house and forman are in competition to solve the case.  wilson and house have a side bet on yet another case.  ho hum.<br /><br />part of the problem may be that i am watching some wonderful films lately which are up for the Oscars plus some tv shows from other countries.  the originality is so refreshing. however, one thing i know is true about this show.  i now drag myself to watch House every week as some kind of duty rather than the pleasure it once was. i'm hoping i just give it up shortly.  i wish he'd stayed in prison.  at least it would be a fresher take on this show.

B006FTCH2E|5.0|i was not expecting much from this movie. ironically i suppose this is because i was a huge sci fi fan as a kid and young adult.  however, i got rather burned out in the genre by the explosion of special effects movies over the decades.  so i thought, ho hum, another razzle dazzle sci fi movie.  no, it isn't.  it has a significant sci fi element to it but the bulk of the movie is about her attempt to redeem herself with the man whose family she killed at a crossroads traffic collision four years ago.she was somewhat drunk from a party and looking up at the other earth planet when she plowed into their car.<br /><br />her brilliant future at MIT is smashed to pieces as she serves a four year jail sentence. it is then that she seeks out the man whose life she ruined.  simultaneously, she writes an essay so she can be one of the people allowed to go on the first flight to the alternative earth.  she sees that as a way of redemption too, after she fulfills this first redemption.  this very much reminds me of an art house feature which at one time i would have seen at the film society.  nowadays i see it online.  i highly recommend it.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B004LR5K0I|5.0|I purchased this set from the UK on Amazon marketplace.  I am very happy with it.  The price was bargain basement!  Worth the wait of it arriving from the UK.  This new version is in a compact format.  The cds are in the covers and not very secure so I put them in paper sleeves.  The liner notes are great but hard to read as they are imposed over pictures.  Even with these quibbles I am very happy to have this set.  I had purchased the 50's and 60's sets but not this one.  I have always been fond of this period of Elvis and had originally bought a lot of the albums this covers.  RCA vinyl in this era was less than desirable so the cds are an upgrade.

B006CDCWDM|3.0|At the beginning of the book, Rafa says he's not a product of a rotten childhood where a parent lives through him and pushes him mercilessly. Hello???? It seems to me that that's exactly what his Uncle Toni did. He never praised Rafa, only told him the other player played better than he did when Rafa won a tournament. Uncle Toni seemed to me to be a relentless \\"pusher\\" of Rafa, urging him to play even when he was terribly hurt. Granted, Rafa had the talent and the will to be a great athlete, no matter what sport he chose. I'm enjoying the book, but it makes me feel sorry for Rafa.

B000BTJDGC|5.0|The Exorcism of Emily Rose has got to be one of the best films of its kind. If you watch at night it may scare you a little bit but truth be told its not really a horror movie as much as a film telling the story of a girl who gets possessed. There are parts that are done so well that you'll get chills and goosebumps. Its just an all around great film a must buy! on a scale of 0 to 10 I'd give it a 8 and a half
B0054JZC6E|4.0|While some of these games are slightly annoying most of them are quite entertaining. The ads get tiring but that's okay it's 101 free quick games.
B001609SQA|2.0|This movie is trash compared to the original Alien, which is beautiful. Aliens (2) is full of cliche stereotypical James Cameron mainstream storytelling. It tries to turn a horror movie into a family movie, with goofy dialogue (though some of it is humorous), a prominent \\"poor and innocent yet optimistic and brilliant\\" child role which is really annoying, another cliche annoying \\"I'm stuck up and will do anything for money\\" character, a cliche \\"Hero\\" character, and crazy meaningless numb violence. The only good things about it is Bill Paxton is fun to watch and there are a few neat special effects. Do yourself a favor and watch the original Alien, again if you have to.

B006QVRVJK|4.0|i think we can all remember back to our schoolyard situations.  there was not a phrase then like \\"what happens on the playground stays on the playground\\", but there should be! that's what gets the whole thing going.  one kid ends up with two knocked out teeth and those parents ask the other parents over to their apartment to discuss the situation.  they try being pleasant for a few minutes but then they make the big mistake of socializing a bit over dessert and coffee.  the four of them get progressively incensed from there.  towards the end they add liquer to the mix and all hell breaks lose.<br /><br />the thing i liked best was the male character who was using his cell phone to live his life.  not a minute went by when his phone didn't vibrate and he got involved in some consultation.  i was ready to kill him myself as nothing drives me crazier than cell phone abuse and overuse.  the play and the actor captured this phenonomenon to perfection.<br /><br />the two mothers, played by jodie foster and kate winslet, are more over invested in this dilemma than the fathers.  as it goes on, the fact creeps out that both men believe duking it out on the playground is a rite of passage into manhood. the mothers are more like the united nations, trying to find a method of appeasement to the hostilities. frankly, i think the fathers probably are correct.  i'm not sure parents ever do anything but make this situation worse by interfering.<br /><br />there are a few problems. it is very stagey.  you can tell it was a play. also, it is way too short.  it needed at least another fifteen minutes of script.  it has a dream cast, however, and on the whole is very good.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

159514188X|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is an amazing book.  Though  Hannah Baker (main character) had committed suicide and some parts of the book had been a bit disturbing it was very well delivered. O couldn't ask for it to be any different. Before I had written this review I wanted to say something rememberale or something beautiful but all I can truly say is, wow.
1451627289|5.0|This book grabs your attention from the beginning and doesn't let it go.  I read it in two days and couldn't put it down.  I have liked some of King's work in the past and this one ranks with \\"The Stand\\" as some of his best work.  Even if you don't like Kings work , you will like this.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|not bad some games fun some a bit poor. all in all above average for the games gust are good.
B006WT2TZC|5.0|A Scorpion fan for over 20 years. Love this album my old favorites plus great covers. This one will be on my mp3 player for a long time.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|would buy it again in a heartbeat. far exceeded my expectations. ive tried the.other two il camera apps, buy this one.  its the best
1423389387|4.0|Wow, what a story! Mr. Rothfuss can sure spin a tale. While some parts of the story did seem to drag on a bit, the story still held my attention. It's beautifully written and Kvothe is still a very likeable character. I learned more as the book progressed and I was still left with some questions, which I'm hoping will be answered in the 3rd book. I will say that I didn't enjoy this book as much as the 1st book, TNOTW. But it was still worth my time and energy. I can't wait for the 3rd book and a note for new comers: this book is not a stand alone. Book 1 (The Name of the Wind) should be read 1st.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|There isn't a bad song on the album, a little different from their previous albums, but in a good way. I can listen to it over and over. Super happy with the sale. Shipped earlier than projected. Completely satisfied!
B006A819AG|5.0|after all these years, the roots continue to inspire me. deep lyrics, beautiful music, amazing production. undun is five stars from start to finish.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|It will make you get up and dance! I like to change up the tunes to match my moods! Yeah!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|my 9 year old and 6 year old like to play this on the kindle fire. my 6 yr old likes it more. glad i purchased it. tons of fun.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Great for protection,lightweight and simple.  My issue is that the case does not convert to a stand as the pictures indicate.  My husband and I wanted a case that we could use as a stand for visual displays for our toddler and the lightest touch sends the Kindle crashing.  Good case, poor stand.
B005HSL626|5.0|bought this for my 9 year old on his kindle fire. Seriously? Slicing fruit? Yes and lots of fun. his friends like to play this on it as well.
B006NXIO0Q|5.0|This is about a women who is almost unstoppable.It is a must see, she is like a super hero. This is a great movie, and I am not really in to action movies.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|my 9 year old and 6 yr old like to play this. neat graphics. well worth the price i paid for it. kindle fire
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I never thought I would be reading the Bible.  This app makes it so simple.  Just chose your plan and now you can set a reminder too!  Absolutely love it!  I would (and have) recommended it to others!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I am very satisfied with this product.  It looks professional, feels nice in your hands, and holds the Kindle securely.  I am also hoping that the natural, book-like appearance will deter theft.
1451627289|5.0|Ok, So I'm a Dean Koontz fan who found the title of this book interesting. I gave it a try and wow what a book.  I just finished it. A lot of time and effort went into this book. The book has a great story and is in great detail  that keeps the reader interested. Great job Stephen King.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is awesome if you are a Christian  it has all the books/types of the Bible also and its also like facebook or flail but for facebook in a good way ... so if you are a Christian GET IT! Which i love people who are Christians.
1455510319|5.0|While definite more deliberately paced than his other novels, the ending more than rewards the reader's patience. It was every bit as interesting as his earlier works. Honestly, I found the amount of one star reviews shocking, as one star should be reserved for a poorly written novel with a nonsensical plot, IMO. Perhaps many American readers are in \\"need\\" of thrill a minute page turners, and have lost the appreciation the for the art of storytelling. Many of many favorite authors are British, where the pace is languid, but it all ties together in the end. Connelly is excellent, and I look forward to reading his other works!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I think this app is awesome,love the 7 day forecast as well as the radar map :) weather is always up to date and very accurate
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Love this movie! Great music and dancing as well as costumes. It's a wonderful tale about being yourself and \\"going for it\\". I highly recommend it to anyone interested in music. Paul Mercurio is also insanely handsome.
B0042RUMH8|5.0|This was actually my first time buying a complete JLO album, and for the most part I love it. I like her voice, I love her Spanish version of On The Floor with Pitbull. And I love most of her beats, they sound awesome in my car. There are few songs that I don't like, or frankly cannot stand, but perhaps if you were thinking of buying this, I'd say, for the most part, whenever I buy full albums, I don't like all of an artist songs. But honestly for the price, I'd say go with it, so ya got maybe one or two, or maybe even three songs you wouldn't like, you still have the rest of the cd. I'd say preview the songs either on Amazon, or Itunes, see if you like a majority of them, if so, buy the cd. If ya can't stand the beats, or the lyrics to a couple of songs, then don't buy it.
0307887960|5.0|Listen, Dr. Dukan is a respected doctor, and this diet works. Period. So don't listen to the naysayers who are skeptical... listen to all the people like me who've lost weight! I've lost 30 lbs. and kept them off, off, off. FYI, I'm 55, post menopausal, on hormones, don't exercise and have a lot of stress in my life: I just lost my beloved 16-yr-old dog, who grew up with my 2 sons who are now leaving for college at the same time. Triple WAAHHHHHH! But yes, I've kept the weight off. I didn't even follow the plan exactly. I kept my favorite flavored Coffemate Creamer, I didn't eat the bran (still pooped just fine, thank you!), and I stayed on the protein-only regime longer because, frankly, I love steak, chicken, tuna, turkey, lean (90%) sausage, non-fat greek yogurt (yes, the flavored kinds, like Chobani!), cottage cheese and milk. I've never been a big veggie fan... I'm a carnivore! After a week of lean proteins, I lost all my cravings for bread, donuts, pasta, tortilla chips, chocolate mint oreos and fruit, I was no longer bloated, and I felt \\"cleaned out\\" (you know what I'm talking about!) My cravings didn't return, even after I started cheating 1 day a week (the eat-what-you-want day). So basically, I didn't even do this diet the EXACT way you're supposed to, and I still lost 30 lbs! Just go total protein, skip the FAT, and you'll see, it works!
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I loved this cd, it's a little bit more edgy and of course that's right up her alley. So if your looking for something to listen to in the car, preferably with the windows up (As the cd is quite,.....well dirty is how I'll put it) then this it. Otherwise I'd say if you have children, or are a bit more conservative, don't get this cd. Buy the clean version or some of the nicer singles off Itunes or something.
030014332X|5.0|When I first heard of this book, an English translation of a German version, my thoughts immediately turned to a book I'd previously read which was also written in German originally; [[ASIN:0394702689 Memories, Dreams, Reflections]].  I recall no reading experience filled with as much agony as this particular book because of the poor translation and content.  I happen to believe dreams reflect nothing more than meaningless meandering subconscious thoughts suppressed during waking moments that surface in sleep.  Obviously Mr. Jung begs to differ.  Well, \\"A little history of the world\\" was neither.  The translation was very readable, and the content relevant and kept my interest throughout.  My second concern was the oversimplified content, since the author had written this book for the young; read no further than the title of the book.  I was not disappointed in that regard either.  I can't imagine what youth Mr. Gombrich had intended as his audience, but they must have been nothing short of youth prodigies.  While the writing flowed very well, the content was above high school level in my opinion.  In 1935, Mr. Gombrich wrote, \\"There are many millions of people on our earth who cannot find work and every year millions die of starvation.  We all hope for a better future - it must be better!\\"  According to UNICEF, 7.5 million children die of hunger every year, and the CIA Factbook states 8.8% or over 600 million people were unemployed in 2010.  More than 40% of the world's population or 2.8 billion do not have access to toilets (CNN:  The World Needs More Toilets, Nov. 19, 2011).  It must be better, but unfortunately, roughly 80 years after Mr. Gombrich's wish, it is not better.  We shall continue to hope for a better future.  \\"A Little History of the World\\" is a pleasant read, and I highly recommend it for the youth as well as adults.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I am far from a prolific reader, but I've probably managed at least a few hundred novels in my lifetime.  There are plenty of reviews here which preview the story.  I'll simply state that this may very well be the best novel ever written.  As I stated to the person who recommended it to me, \\"I will have to punish you for recommending that book.\\"  \\"Why? You didn't like it?\\"  \\"I loved it. It may be the best book ever written, but it is so painfully sad.\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is very challenging and soo very versatile! I definitely recommend this one. With so many different types of games you can play for hours at a time.
B001KMB6X2|3.0|Babylon AD was actually pretty good, alot of people seem to not like it on here but its not to bad. I bought it and I'm actually happy that I bought it and just didn't rent or catch it on tv. The plot overall is actually good I dont want to say to much but without giving anything away it takes place in the future and is about man hired to transport a girl to new york whom is worth alot (for a unknown reason until the end). If your a fan of vin diesel or if you liked doomsday or escape from new york, you'll probably enjoy this film. I will say there were parts that I didn't really care for and could it have been done better? yes but it still was good. On a scale from 0 to 10 I'd give it a 7 and a half
B00632HWOG|5.0|I really like this app but they should put &quot;compose message &quot; on it so that it would be easier to view and send messages.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|a mix of racing and business Sim mixed together. very entertaining game. the controls worked fine on my kindle. very good graphics. wish there were more levels.
B005HSL626|5.0|Best game i have ever played. i play with my frends and they enjoy it a lot. maximum players you can play is with 2 players. it is very fun to play on the kindle Fire!!!!! GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!
0307946711|3.0|The author uses extreme characters and ramps up stereotypes, but they accomplish his goals. I loved the historical backdrop and the references to key events over the last 20 years. I would recommend it to the open-minded.
B000002QWD|5.0|Bing Crosby<br />Merry Christmas<br /><br />If you're going to play Christmas music, you have to have this CD.  This has been a classic for decades and will remain a classic for decades to come.<br />Five Stars.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was looking for a cover/case for my Kindle Fire and read reviews on every single option out there. I finally decided on this one and I'm very glad that I did. No, it doesn't swivel or do any other \\"extras\\" offered by other products, but it's:  *light weight  *free standing  *it protects the Kindle--without covering up any portion of the screen  *it virtually doesn't take up anymore space than the Kindle itself, because it fits like a glove.  *not over priced  *doesn't have a bad odor or any odor at all  *doesn't cover decorative skins on front of Kindle (will cover the back skin though)  In addition to those accolades, I also like that it's environmentally friendly (including the packaging it comes in).
B00000DR5D|4.0|Tangerine Dream<br /><br />Ricochet<br /><br />(Virgin 1975)<br /><br />This one showed a few signs of the less ambient and more creative album they were to being creating, but only a few signs.  However, the whole idea of a LIVE Electronic Music concert was enough to stretch the perceptions and possibilities of musicians in 1975 who thought that this could ONLY be created in the studio. Yet, Larry Fast (Synergy) was already releasing more dynamic and influential albums.  Tangerine Dream was going to change (and for the better) largely in response to Synergy's \\"Electronic Realizations...\\" album.<br />Four Stars
B006C1DH92|5.0|If you like fruit ninja, this is a game you shouldn't hesitate to pick up. It is Fruit Ninja with a Puss in Boots flavoring. Not much else to say. Same easy gameplay. Well priced at a buck. Worked perfectly on both my EVO 3D and my Galaxy Tab.
B002MW50KO|3.0|Bob Dylan<br />Christmas In The Heart<br /><br />One of the strangest and most strained albums in Dylan's career.  Although the profits from this album will go to feed the hungry, it's hard to imagine they will be making much profit from it.  It is a curiosity album for the Dylan fan and a few (like me) will even find a couple of gems in here, but for the general public, this is one to pass up.  It is certainly not one you will want to play for guests at Christmas time.<br />Three Stars (2 ½)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|What a throwback to my childhood and countless hours of playing Missile Defense. Updated graphics and tapping on a screen is a LOT better than using an old Atari Joystick. I wish they had this technology when I was a kid. Worked perfectly on my Galaxy Tab.
B00005M989|3.0|Bought in a cutout store bin, this one gives me the eight important (and fun) hits from the eighties.  The rest could have been left off.  Three Stars.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|It's like that song on Sesame Street: \\"One of these things is not like the other.\\" Now instead of pointing at a TV you can interact on a phone or tab and pick for yourself which you think is different. Kept my little (hyperactive) niece occupied for fifteen minutes, I think that speaks volumes!! Worked without issues on both my EVO 3D and my Galaxy Tab.
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|Pink Floyd<br />The Final Cut (1983)<br /><br />Having already make their masterful album The Wall, which was partly about the insanity of War and the insanity that it breeds, they return to the subject on the occasion of the recent Falkland War.<br /><br />The Falkland War was fought in 1982 between The United Kingdom and Argentina in a sovereignty dispute over the Falkland Islands and the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, which are located just east of Argentina.<br /><br />Roger Waters saw that war as an futile attempt by the U.K. to keep the last bits of a kingdom where \\"the sun never sets\\", no matter how useless those bits of land may be to the U.K.  As a commentary on that War, with several references back to The Wall, this is a brilliantly written and executed album.  This is a Five Star album.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|Got excited to see an HD version of Mahjong. Downloaded right away!! But it crashes on my Galaxy Tab. I should have got my money back but waited too long.
B000669GAI|4.0|Pearl Jam<br />rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991-2003)<br /><br />This 2 CD set has all the songs we remember from the radio and several fine examples of their overall work.  This is an important set in the history of the `grunge' movement but as a hits package, I like it more than love it.  Four Stars.
0061969656|4.0|Uhtred is back in the sixth installment of the Saxon series. King Alfred (later known as Alfred the Great to us) is dying and is dead partway through the story, leaving the kingdom open to attack from different opponents, especially the Danes. But they don't attack right away and this puzzles Uhtred so he goes off exploring into Dane territory as well as seeking the input from a witch. Of course, more is happening than Uhtred realizes and don't worry because there will be fighting with Danes. That said, there isn't as much as in the previous books which was a bit disappointing to me. This novel focused a great deal on the politics and may have been a setup for the next novel, I suspect. As usual we get the gore, dirt and tense shield walls of the period. Cornwell is arguably the best author for military historical fiction so if this period is of any interest to you he's the one to read. Because the battles were a bit on the low side I gave this novel a notch down from the previous ones. STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; PERIOD/ACTION SCENES: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN READ: January 2012.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Swype wasn't installed on my htc incredible 2 so I tried using the beta instead. This keyboard is much better!! It's perfect for correcting rapid, sloppy typers like me :) Love this app! I got it for free but I would pay for it any day!
B0034G4P80|4.0|Thor surprised me because I was expecting Captain America to be the more entertaining superhero movie of the two releases in 2011 by Marvel.  Not only did it keep my attention for the entire length of the film with good special effects, great acting (Natalie, Anthony, Chris, and Tom), and decent superhero story, but there were several funny moments that make it unique.  A couple examples without giving anything away but to look out for are the multiple car incidents and the coffee cup scene.  I'm a big fan of Marvel comics so I can be critical of the translation to movies, but this movie was done with justice.  As a result, I have added Thor to my elite DVD collection.  I look forward to Thor 2 and the Avengers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so worth the download. some of the games are challenging but fun at the same time. so worth it.
B0061S073A|5.0|Greatest app in the world!  The only way I would give my fire to my 2 year old.<br /><br />You pick the apps they can use.  They can't change anything including installing, deleting, getting to the internet, or the volume!<br /><br />I install it for my friends now so they can protect their phones.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Brand new and feels like it.  Needed a second controller for multiplayer, went with an original.  I forgot how nice a new controller is.  Fast shipping, works great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|just starting out...so far so good! fun games! not too hard for most of them but not super easy either. thanks!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great variety in games, dont have to spend any money if you dont want. games are fun and help pass time. loveeeeeeee it!!!!!!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|A must see movie!!!! Rented it & immediately after purchased it! Very family friendly. Puts EVERYTHING into perspective for you!
B002BU0DPE|1.0|This item might be a great price, but the item is NOT very durable. After just a month the item broke at the ear piece from taking them on and off. This item needs to be better designed and with quality product [not flimsy plastic]
1575666286|5.0|This information in book is amazing! It teaches you all about how to eat to \\"treat\\" yourself with nutricion. It also teaches you how to prevent disease before it occurs by following a simple diet. I have always been a health nut anyway, but this book radically changed my eating habits and I feel great! This book even helped me convert a friend of mine who wasn't a healthy eater at all. She now also eats mostly organic foods and gave up meat!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love this cover!  It's very easy to use, the Kindle just popped right in and it fits perfectly.  It's also very sleek and lightweight, which is a plus.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it works very well I don't even have to open the app I can just go to notifactions for temperture cert easy app worth it for free.
1593272790|5.0|I got this for my 9 year old son & he loves it, just wishes it had come w/legos & the motors for some of the contraptions... Other wise he loved it..
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is very nicely done Bible app. I would recommend this to a friend.  Scripture look ups are easy. Plus can listen to while on the go. Thanks for the app.
B005TF24GO|5.0|Kung Fu Panda 2 was as great as the first one. So glad they made a 2nd, to show where Po came from.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun time passer and its good for everyone of all ages especially the first mini game this is my first 5star review
B002VX0A40|5.0|I was so in love with [[ASIN:B004BSFC6E Lamaze Play and Grow Rusty the Robot Take Along Toy]] that I immediately had to buy my baby girl more friends to play with! Dee Dee is so freaking cute with her dorky teeth and colorful body! She is not quite as educational as Rusty but I think Dee Dee will be just as fun for her to grow with and be BFF's with in the end!<br /><br />BTW we now have added [[ASIN:B002VWZU7S Lamaze Early Development Toy, Captain Calamari] and [[ASIN:B000I2MRLK Lamaze Play and Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy]] to the crew!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After reading the 'back cover' I was not so sure why everyone was recommending this series to me.  But I can tell you, it was a wonderful surprise.  I was worried about the extreme violance these games would include, but it is so tastefully written.  I finished all three in a matter of week, and now I am wondering what I will ever find to hold my attention!  There are so many lessons to be learned from this trilogy, but I am not sure a younger audience is mature enough for some of the content. I can't wait for the movie, just hoping they make it true to the story and don't mess up this great work!
B006TLFIAQ|2.0|It is obvious at the start of this film, the budget was blown on the actors.  Writing, exposition and overall delivery fell short of the amazing lineup on the bill. This film does not deliver and is a colossal waste of time.  I'd have turned it off- but It was like a car wreck I couldn't walk away from.  Robert DeNiro- he's on the cover- but disappears for about and hour and a half during the crux of the story-line.  While Statham is generally compelling to watch, and Owen is convincing- they cannot hold up this bag of hot air.  Seriously- go vacuum your rugs- it would be a better use of your time.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Cars is one of the kids favorite movies. Got here fast no scratches, kids loved it.. Definitely some improvements in quality from the dvd
B004H3C2TI|4.0|Very nice packaging an bonus materials. The Litho set is awesome!! There are a few things missing from the DVD to the Bluray and Bluray to DVD so if you want all the bonus feaures you have to watch both discs.
140053271X|1.0|As a librarian, I can not and do not recommend this product to my patrons.  The product itself is faulty, and the customer service and return policies are very poor.  My mother loved her Nook Color so much, she offered to buy me either the Color or the Touch.  I went with the Touch, thought something simpler would be nice, since I work around computers all day.  I was wrong.  Within the first 20 days, my Nook started to devour battery power.  I was told when I bought it I had 30 days to return it for a new one, but apparently, they changed that.  I was offered a refurbished product to replace a brand new one, which I thought was really cheap of them, and not good customer service.  Then, I was told it was a software issue, and would be resolved soon, so I held on to my Nook.  One software update and two other fixes later, and it STILL drains the battery by the minute, lasting only about 8 hours, instead of the promised 2 months.  I was told to call the warrenty dept, but that was a wasted call - they only repeated what had already been said, and also pointed out I'd now had the unit for 90 days.  Well, yes I did, but it didn't work MOST of that time, and I only kept it because they kept saying it would be fixed!  And yes, the wifi was OFF, it's rarely on, actually.
1451627289|4.0|I don't read much fiction; I probably should read the stuff more often. This book reminded me of what a pleasure it is to read a good yarn that causes you to keep turning the pages until sleepiness forces you to put it down for the night. I've never been much of a fan of the time-travel gimmick in story-telling, but King makes it work as well as could be expected in this story. His descriptions of 1958 and succeeding years ring true to my own recollections. Only a couple of anachronistic clunkers come to mind, such as having one of the characters from \\"the Land of Ago\\" talk about the Chicago Bears winning the \\"NFC\\" (there was only the \\"NFL\\" back then; the NFC and AFC were not created until the NFL-AFL merger of 1970.) King is excruciatingly detailed in describing physical injuries that people suffer as a result of accidents or assaults, perhaps drawing on his own experience of being run over by a motor vehicle. He always excels at the small details in his descriptions. I don't think his usual feel of authenticity quite comes through in his descriptions of love and sex scenes, which are fairly ordinary and predictable. I always have felt King is better at short stories and novellas than long works like this, but there's only a few spots where this one lags; this may be because the very nature of the storyline propels the book forward to its inevitable climax. Certainly I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun read, especially anyone who - like me - has personal memories of 11-22-63 and all the speculation and conjecture that followed.
0786888628|5.0|This is my second reading of Halberstam's study of the Korean War, and feel his interpretation of the first half of the conflict, and long term impacts, are spot-on. He accurately breaks down the failures of leadership (on all sides) to understand the geographical conditions and needed logistics, the strategic and tactical ramifications of their decisions, while providing enough anecdotal details of combat from generals to privates to keep the reader interested.  This is great reading for those interested in the dynamics of command. Some might take offense at his analysis of aged General MacArthur, but that does not change the supportive facts within Halberstam's writing. He vividly describes MacArthur's organization and communication dynamics that led to the failed effort to secure the south bank of the Yalu River, and the horrific retreat which followed.  He also accurately describes the difficulties that can befall \\"top-down\\" leadership models which ignore \\"bottom-up\\" information contradicting the presumed model and plan of action. His writing describes all the strategic leaders: MacArthur, Truman, Mao, Kim Song Ju and Syngman Rhee. It also reviews leadership at the headquarters, corp and staff level that had tremendous impact on the ability of the division/regimental leadership to get the mission safely and efficiently accomplished.  It also describes the courage of leaders who thought through the environment and situation to save their men,and also, sadly, describes those who did not.  I have found few writers who can frame a conflict and interpret the long term results and echoes that follow the conclusion of a regional war. Halberstam has succeeded. You will not be disappointed in this book.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|This is filler. Plain and simple. 80% of the chapters made no forward progress in story line whatsoever, and the other 20% were drawn out and still managed to be boring. The two best characters (the ones completely missing from the last book) made a few out-of-character bad decisions, but were mostly just blown about randomly by fate and fortune. The two coolest fantasy elements (dragons and Others) were almost completely absent. Bran finally made it north, only to spend the rest of the book literally as impotent as a whisper in the wind.<br /><br />This is why I hate filler. If an author feels like delaying a story to build up tension (or to buy time, or to fatten their wallets) then write back story. Pre-histories. Any number of fun entertaining stories can be told this way. And since they are sufficiently removed from the main plot line THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE DEVELOPMENT. Fillers can't go anywhere, because at the end of the story you need to have everything essentially the same as when you started. Making the whole exercise nearly as frustrating as the \\"it was all a dream\\" trope.<br /><br />The press release that George Martin thought these last two books were actually required (and couldn't be shortened) is very disturbing. Hopefully, it is just a lie used to squeeze some money out of readers. The alternative is that he really doesn't know where he's going with these book anymore and they will go on like this till the (tv) series is canceled.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was excited to read this book because of the thought of exploring an alternate history.  While that exploration is not very long, I was surprised to find that I was more compelled by the love story that takes place through most of the book.  Also, the thriller-esque portrayal of trying to change the past is gripping.

B001G0MFOM|1.0|I finally rented Season 6 off of Netflix, although I had already read recaps so kind of knew what to expect.<br /><br />It was worse than I imagined. I agree with many other reviewers that it started going downhill Season 4/5- definitely Season 5. The show stopped being about a dynamic, interesting, and likeable group of women, and became this strange tribute to Jenny Schecter- as if this young woman actually had the amount of power over this group of ladies that she was portrayed to have in Season 6? None of the characters' actions or reactions make sense by this time. Season 5 I quickly lost interest in; as it was already pointed in this direction, sadly.<br /><br />Ilene Chaiken has certainly lost the respect of many fans with what she chose to do to the show and how she chose to end it. I believe that she is as delusional as the doomed Jenny Schecter, and really, I wonder if that is the character she most identified with. If so- no need to explain further.<br /><br />I refuse to view Season 6 as actually happening, and while I am at it, I'm going to just leave the world of the L-Word at Season 4. And hey, in my world, Carmen and Shane get back together :)
0156347113|1.0|The General Theory of how to economically bankrupt a country through deficit spending and racking up high debt. All for what purpose to replace capitalism with socialism or communism? Instead for fiscal responsibility and social conservatism read Pius XI's On Social Reconstruction and Leo XIII's The Condition of the Working Classes. Vote Newt in 2012!
B003E6K1VK|2.0|I bought this to power my new Beats Pros and after about 12 hours of runtime at 20-45(out of 60) volume the thing died. It would no longer produce any sounds at all at any volume out of any headphone from any source, dead.  While it did work the thing sounded amazing and was very powerful, enabling volume boosting for my android phone and tablet (notoriously weak volume devices). Volume on this thing seems to surpass an iPod touch 4G at about 40/60. The audio quality was very smooth and very full. Bass boost worked well but a mid and treble control would have been nice for the price. Very nice metal external build quality.  I am almost tempted to buy another one because it could have been just defective but I have yet to decide. If I do I will update.
B0054W4JQK|1.0|Before I Go to Sleep just doesn't make any sense.  You've got Christine, an old woman who wakes up thinking she's a young woman and that it's the mid 80s, she's naked in a bed beside an old man, she can't remember a thing about how she got there and she just waits around every day after she wakes up for him to give her a spiel that he's her husband.  Surely she's going to wake up at different times every day, with a bladder at different points to busting, depending on what she did the night before and won't go into a bathroom every single time to look in the mirror and at photos taped to the wall. At others times the guy is going to be awake first but at least one morning she'd be freaking out as to why she's naked next to an old man who she admits in her mind she wouldn't voluntarily have sex with, so drugged and date rape is going to enter her mind and she's going to run out the door until she finds someone outside in the streets who she can trust to let her use the phone and call the cops, her parents or at least whoever she remembers as her friend to tell her what happened last night.<br /><br />Plus even if we somehow accept the waking going into bathroom every morning calmly waiting around to be told the spiel was plausible.  Christine's writing a journal of what goes on each day which a doctor who has contacted her secretly, and who tells her the husband does not approve of him, has told her never to let Ben her husband know she's writing it and which she's even written on page one in capital letter Don't Trust Ben.  She often starts off each day's entry saying Ben is downstairs, he'll be up any second and I don't want to miss writing anything down that I've remembered before I go to sleep otherwise I will never remember.  Then each time she starts writing a lengthy synopsis of what happens each day as if she's writing a novel, complete with lack of typos (or whatever you call pencil mistakes) spelling mistakes or grammatical errors.  If she was really concerned about having to get everything down and that her husband could cut off her memories being recorded she'd be writing in dot points, or at least using the inverted pyramid style like journalists do in newspapers where the most important things you write first in case that's all that appears, or the reader stops reading.<br /><br />Instead Christine just waffles on for pages such as when she first remembers Ben, the entry wasn't I remembered Ben for the first time he was doing this, I was doing this... Instead it was something like - I was in the car with the doctor on the way to the house that he says I used to live in, he glanced at me while driving and for a moment I thought he was into me, then I realised he was looking at me the way a young person looks to give comfort to an old woman. I was instantly depressed, (continues on with car journey observations for a while) When we arrived at the home I noticed the grass was 3cm long and was shocked that it was pointier than the grass of the house next door. Would I have lived in a house with pointy grass? Green sure, I mean I wouldn't have lived with brown, but pointy? The front door was wooden and the paint was peeling. I noticed an insect fly by but couldn't tell if it was a bee or just a big fly. I realised the doctor must have knocked on the door while I was distracted by the insect. I hope he didn't notice I was distracted and regretted bringing me here.  A woman opened the door, she was in her late 30s and she was wearing a brown jumper, I think there was a thread hanging out of the left sleeve. Her pants were.... The woman offered us a coffee, I said I don't feel like a coffee, she was clearly disappointed. We walked into the hallway, the tiles were brown in colour, the woman mentioned she had ripped up the carpeting and that her biggest regret was ripping out the fireplace.... As we were walking up the stairs to the bedrooms I told her, you know I wouldn't mind a glass of water. The woman's face lit up, \\"Sure!\\" she said, and we walked back down the stairs into the kitchen where the woman opened the top right pantry door and selected a medium sized glass which was sitting beside shorter glasses which I would have assumed she would have selected but maybe that is because my mind is stuck in 1984 so maybe I'm not down with beverage guest offering etiquette these days. She filled the glass up by placing it under the tap and turning the tap handle. As I was drinking the cool clear water which is made up of one part hydrogen and two parts oxygen you know, I suddenly saw an image of a much younger Ben naked in front of me.....<br /><br />Not to mention at another time she sleeps in a different room so she can write the journal entry and hides it in there, yet when the doctor rings her the next day telling her she is writing a journal and it is hidden in her bedroom wardrobe so she doesn't hang up on him she has managed to find it there. Even though she's living in the future from her minds point of view there's no Marty McFly fascination walking around town seeing what has changed, what new inventions are around.  You also work out what has been going on way before S J Watson stops with the daily journal adventures for another hundred, hundred and fifty pages or so.e walked back down the stairs into the kitchen where the woman opened the top right pantry door and selected a medium sized glass which was sitting beside shorter glasses which I would have assumed she would have selected but maybe that is because my mind is stuck in 1984 so maybe I'm not down with beverage guest offering etiquette these days.

0307887960|5.0|This book is great and the plan works.  It is nothing like the talk shows say the diet plan is.  You never go back to eating anything available to you.  You eat in moderation and only add some foods two days a week.  I like the idea I am away from fruits.  Fruits give me joint problems.  Vegetables never bother me and you can get all the vitamins you need with vegetables.  Great eating plan for life.

030788743X|5.0|This is one of the funnest books I've read in awhile. Irreverent, obscure, geekily nerdy and sometimes hilarious or sad, this book hit the nail on the head in its portrayal of online society. Being an online gamer myself, including some massive role playing games in the past, I can say that the characters in this book were very easy to relate to. In the online gaming community there are a wide variety of people from many different backgrounds. These online games provide an outlet for those people who are socially awkward, physically unattractive or just shy by allowing them to be who they want to be and escape for awhile into a world where they can make friends and have adventures they otherwise couldn't in real life. Religion, race, class and physical traits mean nothing in these made up worlds which the author touches on beautifully.<br /><br />The author used our current economical crisis to paint a dystopian future where people escape into Oasis, an interactive internet/video game. I see that happening in todays society as people become more and more reliant on the internet and games get more and more immersive. Oasis is free to anyone who has access. The Oasis has unlimited data, including every book/cd/movie etc., available to everyone.<br /><br />When the creator of Oasis dies, an evil company tries to take control over Oasis and start charging its users. This is mirroring what is going on currently with companies trying to overprotect their media. The Oasis creator leaves his fortune up for grabs for anyone who can solve his puzzles using 80's pop culture lore. The author sets this up perfectly in a sensical way.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sci-fi, dystopia or fantasy. I also recommend it to nerds, geeks, 80's kids, pop culture freaks and video gamers of all ages.

B005MMYPR0|4.0|1st Note: The first two-and-a-half paragraphs are my original review. The last sentence is my updated review, as I have now seen the entire series.<br /><br />2nd Note: I saw all the episodes with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />This series is intriguing for several reasons. I. It's the story of King Arthur as you've never seen it before, II. It stars Joseph Fiennes (\\"Shakespeare In Love\\") as Merlin, Eva Green (\\"The Dreamers\\") as Morgan, Jamie Campbell-Bower as Arthur and Claire Forlani (\\"The Rock\\") as Igraine and III. It has violence, sex and sorcery (but not the kind we're used to reading about in Le Morte D'Arthur and seeing in John Boorman's interesting, but very freely adapted film version of the classic story by Sir Thomas Malory, \\"Excalibur.\\")<br /><br />Like \\"Excalibur,\\" this series departs radically from the well-known version of the legend, as told in Le Morte D'Arthur written by Sir Thomas Malory and published by William Caxton in 1485. An example: Arthur is a good-looking womanizer. I've no problem with Arthur being handsome, it's just his depiction as a womanizer. It doesn't go with the story, as Sir Ector was a knight and therefore skilled in courtly behaviour and against using women for sex, which is something only a base person and no true knight, much less a true king, would have done. Though Sir Ector tells Arthur not to use his anatomy and always to use his mind & heart when making decisions, it falls flat based on the opening scene. Arthur is nothing like his father Uther in the legend as told by Sir Thomas Malory, whereas here he is exactly like his father, seducing Guinevere even though she is betrothed to another (and it is NOT an illicit affair with Sir Lancelot this time around, either). That's my main issue: Arthur depicted as a womanizer. Also, the dark sorcery which borders strongly on satanic worship is a problem for me. In the legend, the magic does not even approach satanic worship, nor are pentagrams ever mentioned. The acting is great.<br /><br />Final analysis: Interesting series, but Arthur as a womanizer and the dark sorcery are huge minuses.<br /><br />It's a shame that the series has been cancelled, as it ends on a cliff-hanger. I hate it when they do that to a series, cancelling it despite strong ratings and or a great storyline. My reservations of this show aside, it's really good.Interesting series, but Arthur as a womanizer and the dark sorcery are huge minuses.

0385344228|5.0|This book will reel you in from the start.  As others on the US review boards have noted, there ARE a few contrived and predictable twists in the plot.  Even so, the book is well worth the read.  It IS a very intense story about a communty divided and a family torn apart by violence.<br /><br />William Landy is a gifted author and his legal background as a DA makes for a very taut, plausible account.  The story takes place in Newton, Massachusetts which is an affluent bedroom community where professionals reside and the school system as well as the local private schools boast a high academic track record.<br /><br />Things change when a 14-year-old local boy is found stabbed to death in a neighborhood park.  The fact that violence has struck this community has changed the residents' comfortable lull into one of high alert and fear.  No longer do the good townspeople take personal safety and that of their families for granted.  While glad that notoriety has not followed them, but terrified that violence has, residents have revised their view of Newton.<br /><br />Andy Barber, the First District Attorney has a son named Jacob who is the same age as that of the murdered boy.  Jacob has been accused of killing the boy, Ben Rifkin.  Due to state laws, Jacob is tried as an adult for the crime of first degree murder.  Andy Barber takes readers along a harrowing legal and emotional ride and sadly unearths some devastating family secrets that have the great potential to tear his family asunder.  These secrets have a harmful impact on Barber's wife Laurie.  College sweethearts now spouses and parents of a boy convicted of a heinous crime, they have the additional burdens of surviving media attacks and ostracism in their community.<br /><br />Landy is a brilliant writer.  He paints word pictures and his writing style immediately seizes readers' interest.  He compliments his readers' intelligence by using the format of legal documents and court reporters' transcripts.  There is NOTHING extraneous in this story and his gift for giving his characters believable voices is like an arrow hitting the bull's eye.<br /><br />Still, Jacob remains an enigma.  Many questions arise throughout the book, one of which is whether or not Jacob is guilty.  Other questions such as whether or not Jacob is mentally ill; violent; able to conceal a darker side follow readers to the very end.<br /><br />DEFENDING JACOB is an unforgettable book and one that will leave readers thinking about for a very long time.  I highly recommend it.s gift for giving his characters believable voices is like an arrow hitting the bull's eye.  Still, Jacob remains an enigma.

B004LROMWU|5.0|How could any sci-fi/horror fan not like this?  A spielberg produced, compelling story with well developed characters facing an horrible plight!  Without giving away too much, most of these characters have already endured more tragedy then most leading men and ladies ever have to face in 10 years on normal TV.  Regardlesss of the fact that the villians are essentially mindless to this point, the story already has me on my seat wondering what makes them tick.  I am sure you will like this series if you get caught up before season two.  My only criticism is that they left us hanging too long.  After only 10 episodes, we have had to wait nearly a year to see more!
0470932139|2.0|This book is completely useless for an aspiring or an actual commercial photographer; it is a good text for food bloggers and beginners; it teaches the amateur photographer how to photograph food without getting an unpleasant result.  The lighting techniques explained are uncreative and fail-safe; resulting in dull photos that wouldn't sell a dish in a restaurant, but wont look ugly either; all of the lighting techniques listed in the book are a redundancy of using ultra soft back lights and big reflectors; thus loosing texture detail, specular reflections and color; resulting in a photo that is beautiful, but not mouth watering.

B000O59AFW|5.0|Having seen all 4 of the M:I films, and having read rather negative reviews of M:I-2, I have to set the record straight.  This is the best one, but only if you pay attention.  To the plot, to the way the scenes ebb and flow, to the style, to the way the whole film is put together whereby the sum is greater than the parts.  You must understand that John Woo is enamoured with old-fashioned Hollywood, and is Chinese, so honor and love and good versus evil really matter.  Hence, the \\"corny\\" dialogue, and the doves and the fire and the crashing waves symbolizing the monumental battle between good and evil.  If you appreciate old-fashioned movie making, where the good guys are good (albeit flawed - they make mistakes too) and the bad guys are bad, then you will appreciate this M:I film in particular.  Yes, the action scenes are great, but so are the characters, and so believeable are they.  The bonus: the bad guy is a really good, obsessed bad guy.  And what action movie (other than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which is much more than an action movie) has the female lead playing such an important, and strong, role?

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|This movie was incredible.  Wolverine did a great job fighting the machines.  It was refreshing to finally see an x-men movie that stayed true to the comics.  There haven't been any sentinels in any of the previous like 5 movies.  I guess it must have taken place either in the future, or a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.  Speaking of, wouldn't that make Star Wars a historical documentary instead of a science fiction tale?  Anyway, wolverine trained these robots to do all his fighting in this film and apparently used an Xbox Kinect to control them.  And this is where it seemed to deviate from the comics.  Instead of Wolverine using his adamantium claws to destroy the sentinels like in the comic books he captured and programmed one to fight the other ones, similar to John Connor in the terminator movies.  I didn't see the end because I had to leave early due to a meeting with my parole officer.  It was a stupid law.  I got arrested during a martial arts expo I held at the city park.  I dressed up as a ninja and would jump out of trees in an effort to train pedestrians in the ancient art of sword defense.  Swords would have made this movie better too, gone with more of a highlander type feel...in thunderdome, \\"There can be only one after two men enter!\\"  So that's it, the movie should have been called \\"Wolverine the highlander battles terminators in thunderdome.\\" And then it would have conveyed all the entertainment this movie had...and jedis, it needed jedis.

B004UXUUDA|5.0|I hadn't even heard of Sarah's Key, probably because it's French, but it was one of the most pleasant surprises I've had in the past year.  This is a fictional story based on the real events during the round-up of Jews in France during the Nazi occupation of WW II.  In a way it covers a lot of the same ground as Schindler's List from a few years ago.  However, while Schindler's List told an actual story about the real people involved, Sarah's Key is a much more personal story about one fictional girl and what happened to her and her family.  Of course, it's an allegory about what was actually happening to real people at the time.  However, because it is such a personal story about one girl's experiences, it carries much more of an emotional impact than I got from watching Schindler's List.  That's what makes this movie such a great story - emotional resonance.  I think most of the other reviews here are also five stars - and that's what this should be.  This is just great movie making and great story telling.  Highly recommended.
B006O5Y09C|2.0|This movie was a big disappointment. Like most Woody Allen movies, which are too witty for their own good, I did not enjoy it.  In fact, I stopped watching it before the end.
B005FI6IRG|5.0|I fully agree with other learned reviewers that this album is likely to be a hot contestant for 'awards'.<br />Indeed, this is the most satisfying vocal album out in the market for quite some time, and we wonder what really could be bettered in future 'products' of this genre.<br />Firstly, the choice of programme is truly exquisite.  Historical information aside, the works are well chosen and well sequenced, apart from immculately performed.<br />Secondly, the mixing of timbres of soprano falsettist (my term) and alto falsettist of Jaroussky and Cencic respectively works wonders in these works. Christie recalls back in 2007 when the two soloists joined forces in the baroque operatic masterpiece performance Saint Alessio (Landi), that really paved for their subsequent collaboration.<br />Jaroussky's voice is pure and angelic, agile with well- arched phrasing. Cencic's voice is wondrously full and expressive, with the earthen shadings fully nuanced. Both have perfect intonations, and both own immaculate coloratura techniques and terrific musicality that make their collaborations truly jaw dropping in the duet pieces.<br />It is indeed hard to find two countertenors with such well-matched artistry. And as William Christie remarked once, it is difficult to say if any castrati really surpassed these two singers if they are here to sing for us today.<br />We must count ourselves very lucky indeed!
0062082353|1.0|I was a Marine Corps sniper.  Chris Kyle is a religious fanatic.  Like most fanatics he has no problem reconciling his actions with his beliefs even though they are so obviously contradictory.  Most likely he is also a sociopath.  That is the only way he can say that all of the people he killed deserved it.  There is also no acknowledgement that we fought in an illegal war based on lies that had nothing to do with protecting the US.

I can't wait to see how the brothers are in season 7, but I feel a little sad because when the season 7 comes,it means there's no more Supernatural.  Nothing more to say...just watch it and see for yourself.

B006W5JF9Y|2.0|I expected these to be 16/44.1 flac files that could be converted to WAV or AIFF, and that they would then sound the same as the CD. BEWARE! These are crappy mp3 files which sound like crap on any good hifi. This doesn't make sense to me.

B005SNP6FS|1.0|I hated this movie; thought it was ridiculous, especially its ending. It left me thinking I'd wasted 2 hours of my life. I didn't see the point to this movie and keep waiting for more...only for the movie to end without any climax. Don't see this!!!

0441003257|4.0|Pratchett and Gaiman:  Why don't you just knock the chair out from under the entire last millennium of religious history? Oh. You did that already!<br /><br />The omens are not particularly good, nor is the evil especially foul in this lively if a bit lengthy story.  Maggots do some destruction, the sky is split with fiendish sounds and colors, and Agnes Nutter, the nice and accurate prophetess of whatever Gaiman and Pratchett wish, predicts the coming Apocalypse. And the youngster Pepper is full of the milk of human kindness.  As a whole, though, the book is a spastic romp through the pages of Western theology filtered through a spray of laughing gas, a healthy disregard for Christian dogma, and a witch's brew of British humor, a few newts and toads, and a charred Bentley.<br /><br />In the tale, the authors attempt to anthropomorphize Good and Evil by giving us an angel and a demon who are spectacularly poor at their jobs on opposing sides of the karmic fence.  An ancient, fading feud between them does not generate much heat when Armageddon finally arrives.  Indeed it takes outside forces -- including the Four Horsepersons and a gang of British kiddies -- to make the reader sweat a bit at the climax. Armageddon is waiting at the stage entrance, but it is after all only a stage.  God and Satan are opposite sides of the same character, gripping a Rosary in one hand and a scythe in the other. Which face you see depends merely on which side of the street you're walking down. I kept expecting the two protagonists to create more spiritual fury, but instead the authors offered pleasantly off-the-wall banter. Some of it had me LMAO, but somehow the fictive premise and the action on the page did not quite mesh.  It was as if they set the reader up for Hamlet, and then delivered Two Gentlemen of Verona.<br /><br />The reason for that became clear eventually: there is no seriousness allowed in here. The book is a satire on everything holy, but behind the nervous prattle of Pratchett and Gaiman's spiritual confusion lurks a fundamental goodness. This is the grace that raises Good Omens above the level of sophomoric spiritual mockery. The truth is, this rendering of theology actually reinforces my personal belief that nothing really matters very much other than basic human kindness and decency, that everything is a coincidence, and most obviously, when you're dead, you're dead.l confusion lurks a fundamental goodness.

B006H3MIV8|2.0|I rated this 2 stars only because I can't rate great songs worse than this. But these renditions are really awful for the most part. I think a few of the artists here (Patti Smith, Johnny Cash, Brett Dennan come to mind immediately) seem to really understand the body of work and do a pretty nice job of interpreting the songs into their style.  Sting? Holy cow. Can you ruin Girl from the North Country any more? If you want a mix, I'd suggest picking a few off of this cd for download, then go out and get Leon Russell and Joe Cocker's version of Girl from the North Country, Roger McGuinn's version of Chimes of Freedom, The Byrds \\"Mr. Tamborine Man\\" if you don't have it and make a custom mix that does justice to Dylan's music.  If you're a little lazy and don't want to be bothered, just pull out some of your Dylan CDS or LPs and enjoy!

B005RYF5JA|5.0|Saw so many reviews of the performance as seen on PBS - great, but now have received and watched the actual DVD and I can't get over how much is delivered. Sure, I wish it were Blu-ray (after all I watched a bit of the PBS broadcast in 1080p high-def.), but when you get into the concert you stop looking for detail in eyelashes. There are 22 songs. (A Tribute to Broadway is listed as a song, but actually is made up of two: I Dreamed a Dream and Circle of Love.) With the DVD at $12.99, that's $0.59 per song. Use your remote's \\"skip to next chapter\\" button if you don't want to hear and/or watch a particular one. If you own their New Journey DVD and thrice-played it or more, then this is a refreshing set of new songs, extremely well done. I Believe that if you came across this DVD as your first introduction to Celtic Women, you'd be wowed with the amazing performances and staging, along with the quality and variety of songs.
0920668372|3.0|Robert Munsch, &lt;strong>Love You Forever&lt;/strong> (Firefly Books, 1995)<br /><br />This is one of those kidlit classics that pretty much everyone who has ever had young children seems to have on their shelves, that pretty much everyone in the entire world has read, etc. I somehow managed to avoid it until, as what seems a matter of course, my wife ordered a copy when we had a baby. And so, after all this time, I finally got round to reading it. And as much as I hate to say it, I really don't feel the love. I mean, it's a decent enough book, not at all badly written (though it seems to lack some spark; I haven't sat down and analyzed it, but I think my main problem was with the rhythm of the language), but as is often the case when I sit down and read something it seems like the entire rest of the world raves about, I found myself wondering where the fire was when I finally got through all the smoke. ***

0525478817|4.0|Spoilers below.  In my favorite scene in this novel, the narrator, a sixteen year old cancer patient named Hazel, reflects on why she did not want to kiss her love interest, Augustus Waters.  She can't make sense of it--he prepared an over-the-top, Netherlands-themed picnic for her.  He memorized a monologue in which he proposed a trip to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author.  He is cute.  She likes him.  So why, she wonders, did she feel awkward when he touched her face?  Why did she not want to kiss him?  It was too much, Hazel realizes.  He was trying too hard.  He was being Romantic, instead of romantic.  It is that scene, that use of capitalization, which pretty much sums up how I feel about John Green as a writer.  John Green is very, very talented.  I have always had a high regard for his work because he never talks down to his intended audience.  His teenager characters are deeply complex and interesting.  He introduces difficult topics about identity and one's place in the world, about the meaning of heroism, etc.  He respects teenagers as intelligent individuals capable of great understanding, and it's wonderful to read.  Unfortunately, Green, like his character Augustus Waters, often goes too far.  An example:  in one scene, Hazel worries about the ghettoization of eggs.  I fully believe that many teenagers have thought, \\"Hey, why are eggs only served at breakfast?  Why can't they be an any-time-of-the-day food?\\"  I just have serious doubts whether any of them have ever used the term \\"ghettoization\\" to describe that phenomenon.  The argument could be made, of course, that using large, unfamiliar words in such a context is an excellent learning opportunity for young readers.  It challenges them, pushes them to use a dictionary (or, you know, google) and expand their own vocabulary.  I can't really argue with that.  I will, say, though, that it's the use of terms like that that make me see a bit of John Green in Augustus Waters.  In his determination to challenge his readers, he tries a bit too hard; it feels stilted, rather than authentic.  Romantic, rather than romantic.  I have always believed that John Green has it in him to write one of the great American novels; he writes with such a distinct voice, with such compassion and humor.  I've read all of his books, and I have enjoyed each one, but none of them has, of yet, lived up to what I believe is Green's potential.  The characters are often pretentious, bordering on unrealistic.  It makes it difficult to relate to them; they are like the people I wish I were, rather than the person I actually am.  Furthermore, huge, grandiose events seem to always pop up right at the end of every novel, taking you out of the reality of teenagers dealing with actual problems.  Life, not life.  I went into TFioS with low expectations, and with a single capital R, John Green won me over.  Yes, the issues I have with his writing remain--the teenagers are too eloquent, too clever (for goodness sake, how many sixteen year old girls have Prufrock memorized?), and some plot points flirt with improbability.  But, for the first time, I saw self-awareness in the funny yet implausible dialogue.  This is the most growth I've seen in Green's writing, and it's really great; I hope it continues.  I want to see more of lower-case-r romantic John Green.  The Fault in our Stars is romantic, funny, sad, and sweet.  It is a good read, and I would recommend it to everyone.

B005LJK3AC|1.0|The premise of this movie seemed interesting, however, it was unwatchable. We couldn't get past the inane dialogue and the idiotic characters. I think there are enough people that have realistically horrible bosses that could have been the role model for this movie (ie: Office Space) that would have been much funnier than the unbelieveably stupid ones seen here. If you're looking to have your intelligence insulted, rent this.

B006VA57CY|5.0|This is really a soap opera in disguise. I'm a 65 yo male and hate tradtional soaps but this drama is truly addicting. Wonderful period recreation (1912-15) with great character development and terrific acting. I happen to be doing a course on WWI and this fits in just great. Almost like a doccumentary. Also intersting study of the English social system just after the turn of the last century. Highly recommended!

0553801473|3.0|Although I love the series, I have to say that A Dance with Dragons was a well written story with a major content problem. To be fair, the book had some highs, and I was thinking \\"YES! Finally the story is getting good\\" but then I was massively disappointed. The book has a confusing and unpleasantly startling conclusion that leaves me wanting more but dreading the end of the story! I still am in love with the series and I think Martin is a brilliant writer.... but I just need to have faith that he will finish the story with the same awe inspiring brilliance that he started it with.

0312600844|5.0|Franzen has gotten quite a bad rap from many people for this large, complex book. I disagree with most criticism of the book. But, I will confess that I can't vouch for Freedom's relation to The Corrections. All I can say is that Franzen's characters are true at their core and he perfectly amplifies their traits to exemplify some very relevant corners of American society. I also appreciate the treatment of Mountain Top Removal and the repugnance of warmongering.  Oh, and his sentences are beautiful.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This app is truly awesome but I wish a? Amazon would update it, android market is on version 1.7.4 and amazon is still on 1.6.0. It's kinda embarrassing when someone shows you a feature on the app and you pull out your phone all excited just to find out your old amazon version doesn't have it.  Very disappointed amazon. The 5 stars is for ezpdf reader which is a truly incredible app, but I rate amazon's lazy app updating a 2.
0439023513|3.0|The first two books of this series I literally inhaled. I couldn't sleep because at the end of each chapter a hook would be drawn out and I'd have to keep reading. As I dove into this book, I was expecting the same exhilarating suspense that make me stay up all night reading the last two, but it just wasn't there. I think the author's path was actually a good one and I think her plot was thoughtful, though I know some people were looking for something lighter. The author just crammed it all together in this somewhat difficult to understand blob instead of drawing it out slowly like the last books.  Anyone who is a writer will tell you that the end is the hardest part to write and that's why so many authors seem to screw up even the best books at the end. Either the book gets rushed as the author tries to tie up all the loose ends and get across the main message of the book (especially this one where the real message only comes out towards the end), or the author drags it out way past the reader's attention span so you find yourself skimming to get to the resolution (like Breaking Dawn, which seemed to be the least edited book to ever be published).  Long story short: The plot is good and the message is good, and the overall series is fantastic. This book is the weak link and not the greatest writing, but it served its purpose and tied it all up.
0545123275|3.0|I have been wanting to read this for about a year now so I was really excited when it was the group read for the month. I really wish I could say that it was all I hoped it would be, but I was kind of disappointed. I think that this is a good story, but it is by no means great. It has a lot of potential, but I found the story slow and lacking in passion.<br /><br />The characters could have been better developed and had more personality. I found the main character, Grace, to be a very flat, blank person. I wish that the author would have put more emotion into her. My favorite character was probably Sam because he had the most depth. The other characters were interesting, but once again, I found myself wanting more from them.<br /><br />Overall, this story is good, but I was hoping for great. I will read the rest of the series and hope that the story develops more.

B000FA675C|1.0|What was all the fuss about? Apart from the central idea regarding Jesus's lineage, which is interesting (but isn't exactly original) this is a tedious old read, full of dumb cliches, unbelievable characters (especially the villains) and with these ridiculous childish anagrams and puzzles peppered throughout which, I'm guessing, are supposed to flatter the reader into thinking he/she is some sort of genius cryptographer. Complete garbage.

B0015DROBO|4.0|Everyone has probably said it already, so I'll just say that the Trilogy is an entertaining and undemanding read which, like all good books, keeps you turning the pages. I could have done with less description of technology (which dates it terribly) and a bit more description of people and places, but that's just me. Enjoyed this one (the first of the trilogy) the most.

B005FMZX9Q|3.0|For starters, this is the same model as the 1512, but with a white dial. I have to say, the white dial gives this watch an interesting look, so it can be used with business clothing with no problem. As with other Invicta watches I own, it draws a lot of attention and gets a lot of compliments, a co-worker even asked me where I got it so he could get one for himself.<br /><br />It includes a stop watch function and can also be used as a tachymeter. Included in the box is a set of instructions on how to use all features, which I found a little cumbersome to figure out.<br /><br />Now, there are two issues I found with this watch. I wear my watches on my right wrist, so the fact that the crowns to set it up are on the left side rather than the right, became an issue. The crowns are sized accordingly to the size of the watch, so activities such as driving, make this an uncomfortable watch to wear (I added a couple photos to the product page showing this)<br /><br />The second problem I found is, as other reviewers have stated, the hands are white... on a white dial... it is not impossible to read but it is definitely not ideal.<br /><br />As with the 1512, it is not as heavy as it looks and the band is quite comfortable.<br /><br />I think this is the first Invicta I give only three stars because of this. It is not a bad watch at all, it looks great and well made as it should, if you like it and don't mind those two things I pointed out, you will not regret getting it.

B006WPSQVC|5.0|While \\"Courageous\\" definitely has a Christian perspective, one need not be a Christian to benefit from the film's message - namely, to take fatherhood seriously. Actually, every parent should see this film at least twice: once to get an overview, and at least once more to better absorb the many ways parents can better connect with their kids.  Although \\"Courageous\\" lacks \\"name-brand\\" actors, the all-around cast fills their roles even better than in \\"Fireproof\\" and the acting is solid and natural. The storyline also involves more subtleties and was nicely carried throughout the film.  While one could argue that the next-to-last scene is actually the climax of the movie, the final scene is powerful in its own way and is a fitting way to end.  The story is funny without being corny, intense without being too graphic for children, and poignant enough to make even this fairly crusty guy puddle up at several points throughout the movie.  I came away from \\"Courageous\\" ready to make some needed changes in how I relate to my wife and our children. We're also going to buy our own copy of the movie so we can re-watch it whenever we like without having to rent it again - because I think this is one we'll be seeing at least several more times over the years.  This is a movie I can't recommend highly enough!
B000W796OM|4.0|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition) is the third movie of the Harry Potter series and this time it is a bit darker. Serius Black, an infamous murderer has escaped from Azkaban and the adventure begins. Compared to the prior two movies it is not as long and I feel that at times it feels a bit rushed. The music is as good as the first prior movies and I love the performance of Radcliffe, Watson and Grint. A very good fantasy movie that is to please many children. Some scenes might be a bit scary for small children and a parents hand or a teddy bear can be there for comfort. Recommended. 4/5.
0062059882|5.0|The Good:<br />A complete and satisfying story with a very complex structure, yet it was told and written with simplistic beauty. The characters are strong, multidimensional, & necessary they are all connected yet still individuals. The themes & symbols are seamlessly woven together. The timing of reveals and reversals made the book's pace perfect. The book's meandering plot was good, sometimes it was a bit much but the pay-offs made it all the better. The setting was amazing the use of Midwest American towns and their little gems is truly original. Overall, this is a masterful story of a hero's journey.<br /><br />Things some people may not like:<br />There is gore, sex (one scene with homosexuals), and cursing in the book, although I thought Gaiman described them tastefully (as tastefully as one can, it could have been a lot worse). I found the use of these things necessary to present a true representation of the story world.<br /><br />I've never read Gaiman before and I found this story to be a great introduction. I will read more from him and recommend his books to friends.

0439023521|5.0|I have read few books that invoked such emotion to the point of tears streaming down my cheeks, and actual shouting back at the book/characters.  While I have re-read other novels, I have never done so immediately.  This was the case with The Hunger Games.<br /><br />If you are wary due to some negative reviews, I would recommend you take the risk.  I'm actually going to quote Heather Grace, another reviewer because I think this summed it up the series; \\"They are not comfortable, but very good literature is not meant to be comfortable. It is meant to make you think, to evaluate yourself and the world around you, and to unsettle you enough to wake you up.\\"<br /><br />If you must have sugar fluff, cliche, happy endings, or morally sound and unflawed one dimensional heroes/heroines; definitely look elsewhere.  These characters are tragically flawed, confusing, infuriating, heart-breaking and endearing while their circumstances are brutal, hopelessly dire, and insurmountable.  This book won't make you a better person, but it makes me hope to be a better person and highlights how we all should be better human beings to each other, sacrifice for those we love and cherish them all the more!<br /><br />How much would you be willing to sacrifice for those you care about?  If you are self centered / self absorbed, you won't like this book.
0062060554|5.0|The story starts like a train. Slow as it leaves the station, builds up speed, then hits the top limit with warning horn blasting. It's a thrill ride.<br /><br />Christine Lucas could not be more unreliable as a narrator. She has a brain injury which has destroyed her short term memory, even though unusually she retains her waking day until she sleeps. In awakening, she must learn who she is and where she is and what has been happening to her for the last 25 years. All she remembers consistently is events in her childhood. This significant disability is made clear through the mechanism of Christine writing in her journal, which relates her life for 2 weeks and we see in these pages.<br /><br />She is a married woman who has no memory of her marriage. She had a son she does not remember although every morning, during the usual panic of not knowing where she is, she sees the stretch marks on her body in the bathroom even as she is still processing that she is not 20 something as she thought but closer to 50. She spends an hour every day relearning the same shocking and horrible facts of her past. Every day.<br /><br />Her journal is fascinating. It is her only connection to events previous to her waking up. It is not boring. However, awful as her brain injury is, something more is occurring. Through her journal, Chris is understanding that Ben, her husband, is lying to her. Fortunately, Chris is intelligent and brave, and she becomes determined to find out the truth.<br /><br />I did not see the ending coming. Many reviewers do, but I did not. I assumed the worst, but I had no idea of the twist the plot takes until I was reading it. I read the book in 3 chunks - the last in an all-nighter because I could not stop. This is really a neat book to read.
0547260695|5.0|I am reading this to my kid a chapter a day, who got it as a present. In the end could wait and read ahead.  I don't french (nor pretend to know it), so cannot compare how it is in a different language, but still it is a very good read.  I am sure my kid would be reading it as he grows up and one day understand deeper messages in it.

B004HO6I2E|3.0|This is a movie that's been done before in films like \\"Big\\" and \\"The Parent Trap\\".  However, I don't know if its been done between two grown men so maybe that might be where this is different.  The film is entertaining mainly because of the performances by Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds.  The female supporting cast is top notch as well, Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde who is beyond stunning and no surprise she's going to be in a movie called \\"Welcome to People\\" playing Michelle Pfeiffer's daughter.<br /><br />The male leads were fun to watch as they take over the other's persona.  Ryan Reynolds is a pot smoking slacker who stays home all day having sex and has zero goals.  Jason Bateman plays an unhappy married guy with a young kid and 2 babies.  His life is his miserable lawyer job and his way of finding happiness is buying more cars and houses.  Naturally both guys envy the other one's life.  Jason's character dreaming of spending the day doing nothing like his pal.  And Ryan's character envying that Jason's character has a family who looks forward to seeing him when he gets home to a place crammed with nice things.<br /><br />Both of them get that opportunity to switch into the other's body one drunk night as they're urinating in a park fountain.  Ordinarily they'd be slapped with a sexual predator ticket for doing that and done again in a mall in front of kids which was very strange that it was written that way, but obviously the movie pays no mind to those real life rules.<br /><br />The movie is also crude, crass and plagued with never ending foul language.  Maybe that'll be fun for a teenage boy, but for me it was wearing thin because it simply was not working each time.  There were places where it was warranted and it was funny, but then its sprinkled throughout so you're thinking, 'o-kayyy, what does that have to do with anyone?'  I've been known to curse like a sailor and sometimes no other word will do, but when it's forced in every line then it just comes off forced.  Jason Bateman was top notch in this and really belted out a great performance.top notch in this and really belted out a great performance.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|I expected not too much when I ordered this but unlike a couple of other reviewers found the bonus tracks to be great.  I do not own any boootlegs and these 9 are all worthy of release and the 1st 7-the alternate versions sound amazing.  This may be for the hardcore fan if u own this in other configurations but I was pleased for 11.99. Also this happens to be my favorite Doors album.  I might take away half star for not including bonus tracks from 40th anniversary 07 mix and the alternate of Hyacinth House from the box set but overall am happy to have this. I also enjoyed the subdued \\"Rock Me\\" which was quite different from the numerous live versions out there. I don't really get the complaints...I saw a review of the 30 dollar import set with all the anniversary mixes....5 dollars a disc is a ripoff????For people that don't have them-I am not one-it's hard to find value like that... Great release.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|I was a huge fan of Plants vs Zombies on my ipad, so I jumped on it when I got my Samsung Galaxy. But it's constantly crashing. Not only crashing but completely locking up my phone so that I have to actually take the battery out in order to get it started again. Complete pain in the butt and complete waste of my money and time. Very disappointed.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I have found this series to be wonderfully written. The characters are rounded in a way that, even most of the side characters have depth. The story itself lends itself to an almost campfire atmosphere. You find yourself wondering what will happen next. I haven't been able to turn the pages fast enough.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|The film may take many historical liberties, but it delivers a solid emotional portrayal of the times. The costumes and actors were magnificent. This movie may just turn me into a medieval film fan! Cate Blanchett gave an incredible performance - it's been many years since I've been so enthralled. This is one of the few films I will likely watch multiple times. I think I fell a wee bit in love with Francis Walsingham, the character played by Geoffrey Rush.
B0061TQBRK|5.0|Following the absolute triumph of their breakthrough work \\"Comalies,\\" Lacuna Coil succumbed to the the lure of commercial success with two lesser subsequent efforts. \\"Karmacode\\" was quieter and almost mallcore. \\"Shallow Life\\" dipped even deeper with unnecessary experimental flourishes and the vocals too prominent at the expense of the guitars.  Long time Lacuna Coil fans protested both works and it is obviously the band took into account while working on their next effort.  The result is \\"Dark Adrenaline,\\" Lacuna Coil's heaviest and most satisfying album to date. \\"Trip the Darkness\\" and \\"Against You\\" greet the listener with a one-two knockout punch that serves as a good introduction to what is ahead. Vocalists Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro have never sounded better, and the crunchy guitar sound has been restored to their previous prominence in the mix.  Anyone who winces at the thought of Lacuna Coil covering REM's \\"Losing My Religion\\" should listen first. The Coil totally remake the number with enough force to make Michael Stipe hide under the bed.  The album concludes with the majestic \\"My Spirit,\\" which soars despite a misplaced spoken bridge.  Long time Lacuna Coil fans will welcome \\"Dark Adrenaline\\" as a return to their previous greatness.

B004EPZ02A|2.0|First of all, the movie it self really wasn't that bad. But I think that it is wrong to show people a trailer of a movie like this to get them to watch it or buy it, and then when you watch the movie for yourself your expecting to see those scenes in the movie, and you never do or they change something about it. They were alot of scenes that were cut out of this movie that were showed on the trailer letting people believe that what they showed on the trailer was in the movie.    I'm not going to go into much detail. But one of the scenes that I'm talking about is the bathroom scene with the two little girls. Not what the trailer showed at all.    If they are going to cut the scenes out of the movie that were on the trailer that your expecting to see, at least they could show them as deleted scenes or something like that in the speceal features.    Movie did have good sound and picture quality. If it was not for the misleading trailer. I would have given this movie 4 stars.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is King's best novel since \\"IT\\". I've read most of his work since then, but, until now, it's been bland to me.  After Duma Key, I had decided that I would read no more of his books.  But the plot of this one really peaked my interest!<br />11/22/63 is fresh and exciting, and the only monster is time!  The whole story is well thought out and researched, and the writing makes it so believable!<br />I give it four out of five, only because of the hokey conversations. That's always been my biggest issue with King. The way his characters converse. Sounds like bad actors in a retro b-movie.  That's why Duma Key turned me off.  Who talks like that???

0439023521|5.0|Wow.  Just wow.  I know I am way late to the reading party on this and I could probably (as a former teacher) write an extraordinarily lengthy review, but right now I am just in post THE END mode and am anxious to start book 2.  I must also add that while I normally am not a fan of first person style writing, and had to get past that initially, the story drew me in so deep it no longer mattered after the first 10%.  Well edited also.  I did not catch one solitary mistake.  This story is dark, disturbing and unbelievably for kids??  Published by Scholastic?  It's Dickensian and Running Man and Heart of Darkness and The Truman Show rolled into a captivating page turning tale that unnerves you and still you cannot stop reading!  Maybe my imagination fills in a lot of blanks, but I don't know that I would want anyone below the age of 15 or so reading this.  The final death is...disturbing to say the least.  So few books, especially for youthful readers feature a really strong heroine.  Katniss is that.  She is vulnerable, yet smart and calculating and still has a little bit of innocence and naivete that make you want to protect her.  GAH!  I need a time out.  For a minute.  And then on to book two.
B00006AW2G|5.0|A dark cloud of ominous chords greet the listener as the opening track begins as Mick Jagger laments that if he doesn't \\"get some shelter\\" he will \\"fade away.\\"  Not to be outdone by Bo Didley who would Not Fade Away, but that's a different story for another time.  Thus begins a wild ride of quintessential Glimmer Twins lyrical observations on life, served up in the classic 70s FM rock style.  In fact, if you were around in the 70s and anywhere near a radio, you heard most of this stuff.  Plus one of the weirdest album covers ever!  What happens when the record-changer tries to play the pizza or the cake?<br /><br />A transitional album for the Stones, Let It Bleed features two songs each with Brian Jones (his last Stones album) and Mick Taylor.  This rockin' classic is a real fan favorite and an essential part of any Rolling Stones elpee collection, or classic rock in general, ca 1970s.

B003VIWO9I|5.0|My husband is a huge Terry Pratchett fan and I when he upgraded his Kindle, I inherited his old Kindle 2G with this book still on it. I am glad I read it! It's different from his other Discworld books and is actually the 4th in a series centered on the main character, young witch Tiffany Aching. I was concerned about starting at the end of a series but my husband insisted I could read it as a stand alone book without having read the rest of the series and he was right. Tiffany is a wonderful character and the Nac Mac Feegles who accompany her everywhere are additional comic relief. They may be annoying but I sort of wish I had my own set of Nac Mac Feegles following me around! Story is more serious than other Pratchett books but still manages to remain lighthearted and quick-moving. Another classic Pratchett tale that leaves me wanting to read more of his books

0385534639|5.0|Wow. It's been a while since I've read a book that had me staying up past my bedtime because I could not put it down! This is a love story like no other... it's not a plot line I've read before either. It is based in the late 1880's - early 1900's and centers on an enchanting, mystical circus that only takes place at night. It is appropriately called the Circus of Dreams. Morgenstern is impeccable at describing her circus - I could envision it in my head and wished I could be there in real life. She is just as good with her characters. I was sad to see she has only written one book and anxiously await to see what she publishes next. Her writing style is enthralling, beautiful and unique. It has been a while since a book has been able to transport me into its world & characters so deeply as The Night Circus did. My only complaint (and it is a minor one) is that it got a little confusing because the chapters flip between narrators and times and even geographical location (at times they are decades apart) but this issue was easily alleviated because the chapter titles typically told you the date and place to help you get oriented. A highly recommended read!
0553582038|4.0|Hard to disagree with some of the criticisms of this book, but it's important to keep in mind that this is just half of the story -- Dance of Dragons will fill out the narrative.  I can imagine how frustrating it would have been to wait six years for the second half (DwD) to come out.  Martin is an amazing writer, and this book expands the narrative even further. Lots of unresolved plotlines, but now I'm ready to jump into the fifth book of what has become one of my all-time favorite series.
0061122092|2.0|I read The Alchemist by Pablo Coehlo a few years ago and remember it as memorable and a good read. With this in mind I picked up his more current book, By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept. The story moved along swiftly at the beginning but then the philosophical issues presented kept repeating themselves and the language continued to be so \\"flowery\\", that I lost interest in the characters. Maybe because I am not religious and am not overtly spiritual but even for those of you who are, I think the characters become tedious. I feel like the book repeated itself and nothing new was introduced in the second half, nothing dynamic happened and the climax of the story came and went without much notice. I could see potential but I felt like I was just let down. If you are spiritual, you might enjoy this but when I read the last page I felt like Coehlo had gotten lazy on this novel.

From the perspective of an avid glee fan i can attest to the fact that SMASH is radically different from glee not only in song choices and portrayals but also in direction and development of storyline.  AMAZING!
B006MQRLSA|3.0|The story and concept is interesting, but was how it was told was not as exciting. I kept asking my brother who read the book to help fill in the blanks for me.  The overall movie didn't keep my interest more than a typical made-for-TV film.  There are some glimpses of potentially great moviemaking, but it's inconsistent and sloppy.<br /><br />Many critics also said you don't have to be a fan of Baseball to like this movie, but the only two out of five of us who watched this movie together that thought it was great were baseball fans.<br /><br />I am also a hug fan of Aaron Sorkin and was excited and optimistic when I learned he co-wrote this movie, however was disapointed. It lacks that Sorkin style that was able to make \\"The Social Network\\", another story that could potentially be boring on film into a great movie.<br /><br />I thought Brad Pitt's performance was great, one of his better and deserves the oscar nod.  However, Jonah Hill contributes nothing to this movie and even slows it down. I can't believe Jonah Hill recieved an Oscar Nom for this film!  Phillip Seymour Hoffman does a fantastic job with a very small part in this movie making me wish he had more screen time.<br /><br />In short, worth watching. It's interesting, but nothing to rave about. If Brad Pitt wasn't in the movie, I doubt it'd get as much attention.

1451627289|5.0|I started reading Steven King when his first novel came out and loved it. Then I read a bunch after that. In the past 15 years I have not really read anything by him. I had forgotten what an incredible novelist he is. He can take the unbelievable and make it believable. I read this book in a long weekend. However, I can not get it out of my mind. I wish I still had more to read. I think I will pick up some other Steven Kings books, that previously i had not read because I thought they were too much like science fiction. He takes science fiction and makes it seem real.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|This is really nicely done. The list of extras is not extravagant, it's really centered on the film. The packaging is well designed and feels luxurious for a DVD, but the content is what makes it great. Make sure to see the interview with Peter Sellers where he goes through all the different regional accents in England and compares them to american english. His facility is unsettling, and it underlines his real dramatic skills (Being There) that usually were given a back seat to his his comic work (anything Clouseau)

0385339607|4.0|While `The Firm' still ranks as my favorite Grisham novel, `The Rainmaker' makes it into my top three, mostly for its humor. Unlike Mitch McDeere in `The Firm', Rudy Baylor is a two-bit rookie lawyer going nowhere quickly in life ...he's a grafter among a colourful bunch of friends/associates who add to the fast pace of the novel. The earlier part of the book was in danger of reading like a mini biography of Rudy; despite same the reader is entertained by the array of different characters and subplots that had me wondering what thread would ultimately take centre stage. By the time it becomes clear that the core of the story revolves around the David & Goliath case, as in Rudy Baylor vs the Great Benefits Insurance Company, the pace of the novel noticeably slows. To buy into some of the courtroom antics that follow, a few leaps of faith are required, such as the behaviour of the replacement Judge and how Lady Luck completely embraces young Rudy. That said, you are rewarded with tight writing, memorable scenes and what most people want - the big guy taken down by the minnow with truth on his side.  The secondary thread involved Rudy hooking up with a battered wife...I guess this unlikely relationship was conveniently made to work so that our hero could be rewarded with a lasting slice of happiness beyond his moment of glory in court. Throughout the book, there are plenty of LOL moments, some of which stretched the imagination, but not enough to undermine the story itself. The ending was not up to Grisham's usual high standard...several pages clipped would have added more punch.  In summary, the novel's strength is that it works well at a number of different levels, driven by quirky humor and overall good pace. Apart from a few shortcomings, I highly recommend this novel as yet another good insight by Grisham into the legal world.
159514188X|4.0|Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher, is a beautiful, thought provoking teen novel dealing with the issue of suicide. But more than that, and the reason that I believe it to be a must-read for every teenager in America, it's a focus on the consequences of our actions and our effect on others. I think that the biggest point that the author was trying to get across was that our actions have an impact on other people, whether we want them to or not. While someone may appear to not care or to put aside the way you treat them, it will inevitably affect the person in some way. We can never know the entire story of what is going on in someone's life, and therefore do not know the context in which our actions will be received, and I think that is what Asher really wanted to bring to light for readers.   The novel is written with two narrators, a format that I found created even more suspense in the story. The first is Hannah Baker, a teenage girl who committed suicide before the story begins. The second is Clay Jensen. Clay is a boy who was in Hannah's class, who knew and worked with her. One day he receives a shoebox full of cassette tapes that Hannah made before she killed herself. The tapes give a list of thirteen people and thirteen reasons why she chose to end her own life. After listening to the tapes, each person is supposed to send the box to the next person on the list. Throughout the story, Clay listens to the tapes and follows Hannah's voice through the town as he visits places where the events of her story unfolded.   So many others have praised this book, calling it \\"eerie, beautiful, and devastating.\\" There is even a website, thirteenreasonswhy.com, where readers can post their thoughts and comments on the book and very few are negative. I must say, I have to agree with them; it's wonderful. There was so much about this book that I absolutely loved. Being a teen novel dealing with the extremely touchy issue of teen suicide, it was already high on my list before Ieven opened it. The way Asher went about it only moved it higher in my opinion. It's always hard to write about sensitive issues like this, especially if you want teens to read the book. Asher created the perfect blend of characters and suspense as to keep you reading and thinking about the issues without you even realizing it! He focused on the characters caught in the middle to allow you to imagine being in their shoes, and thus deeply thinking about the issue at hand.   Which brings me to the absolute best part of Thirteen Reasons: the characters. Asher's characters were real, relatable, and believable. He also created them in such a way that just about every reader can identify with someone in the book, or if not, at least something that happened to one of them. Maybe you were the new girl like Jessica, or always making nice like Courtney. The minor characters, I think, really contribute to Asher's message about the smallest of actions making the biggest of impacts.   And the two main characters are amazingly complex and wonderfully crafted. From the beginning, I knew Clay was on Hannah's list. I didn't know if I was supposed to like him, but he was so caring and empathetic that I couldn't help myself. His reactions to the tapes were so pure, so realistic and genuine. Then, when I found out why he was on the tapes, I felt relieved; \\"I knew it all along,\\" I said to myself.   The most intriguing character of all was, of course, Hannah. I read one woman's review saying that she didn't like the book because she couldn't bring herself to like Hannah. In response I say, \\"I don't think you're supposed to,\\" because, honestly, I didn't either. I think we are supposed to like Clay, but his feelings for her made me pity him for caring for someone so crazy, more than they ever made me want to like Hannah. In the tapes Hannah comes off as spiteful and vindictive, but I think that's what makes her such a realistic character. She's a teenager; of course she wants them to hurtlike she did. I think it shows a stage she had to go through before coming to terms with what she had decided to do. Towards the end of the tapes, however, Hannah was much more accepting and resigned to what she was about to do. She wasn't trying to make anyone hurt anymore. She was done. She was giving up.   I think the value in this book lies in its ability to make the reader think. I believe that Asher intended it to be a novel that causes you to examine yourself and the way you treat other people. That's why the minor characters are so key to the big idea of this book. You are supposed to be able to see yourself in this book. And if that makes us, as readers, make changes, or even better understand what another person is going through and show compassion, then I think, Jay Asher,that you have succeeded indeed.
B0007YNRTK|5.0|When I was a child, my older sisters and brothers often had the radio on and more than often I would hear the sounds of Bobby Womack coming across the speakers.  I was naturally drawn to his music because I love poetry and am a poet myself but after watching Bobby Womack UNSUNG, I realize that there were some songs that I didn't remember hearing before like, \\"If You Don't Want My Love\\" and there was another one but I can't remember the name of it now but it was a song that I hadn't heard before either.  So I found myself ordering this cd and another one.  I saw him once at the Blues Festival in Columbia, SC a few years back but I couldn't get close enough to even wish for an autograph because the man that I was with was threaten by this singer...imagine that.  I was in my 30s then and Bobby was probably 60ish but I waited close to midnight just to hear him sing, he was the last performer and the only reason that I went to the concert (nothing against the other singers though).  I also learned that he is a very accomplished guitar player as well.  The fourth song on this album is an instrumental but it got me to moving in my room when I played it.  I love the 70s era, its fashion, its music...so maybe that's why I was drawn to him, his voice, his style; I have a bit of an old soul...and his music, his soul (which I believe plays an instrumental part in writing his songs) speak to me.  I was also impress with his pick of artist for his tribute album by Calvin Richardson, if you haven't heard it...you should get it.  He's not Bobby Womack but he will make you fall in love with him all over again.  Like Bobby, Calvin Richardson, can blow!!!!!!!!!!!!  Keep singing and performing Bobby Womack cause you definitely have a gift and an audience both young and old!!!
B004S3X9ZS|5.0|Joseph Mount lynchpin behind Metronomy comes from Devon & presents that area as an \\"English\\" Riviera, a romantic destination where magic happens. The sound of seagulls opens & tracks build up through to 4th number 'The Look' which is brilliant (also a fab video)...melodic & original. 'She Wants' trundles along & keeps the mood going whilst the gentle 'Trouble' favours some light guitar before bouncing into life. 'The Bay' with its brill oriental start is perhaps referring to the Torquay coastal area but could apply to where ever you are at the time...\\"cause this isn't Paris, and this isn't London, & it's not Berlin, & it's not Hong Kong, not Tokyo\\". The album is a form of futuristic electronica indie pop though seems inspired by the sounds of the 60's in terms of melody & could imagine as a backdrop for 'Dr Who' or 'The Avengers'. The haunting 'Loving Arm' with some simplistic shifts creates a mood for the coast & cliffs. 'Corinne' along with tasty female vocals & fine ideas creates a beautiful soundscape. As with all forms of genius there are parts that irritate like 'Some Written' but probably they had to do this to get through to the other side. 'Love Underlined' hypnotically rises through several counter rhythms coming together into a finale & is another slab of brilliance. This album has across the board appeal & though not the album of 2011 (that goes to The Jezabels 'Prisoner') it comes close.
B004EPZ02A|4.0|This one certainly has alot more action than the first two.  Where they slowly build up to the ending in a put you to sleep pace.  This one after 20 minutes starts up the activities heavy.  But still doesn't explain at the end exactly what is doing the haunting?  Witches?  Bloody Mary?  Demons?  Largely leaves the events of the first two still up in limbo.  A bit deceiving as they don't have many of the scenes from the trailer in the actual movie just like they did in the second one.  You know where Katie walks into the room from the bathroom in the second one.  The third one does this even more.  The bathroom scene with the person showing after they say the words.  Not in movie.  The pyshic guy from the trailer.  Not in the movie either.  A bit dissappointing that you use cut scenes to advertise the movie.
B002UXRH10|5.0|this album is amazing.  it wasn't recieved well by a lot of \\"rihanna\\" fans but i think a lot of the people who consider themsleves rihanna fans are more like radio fans.  this album delievers a gritter more hip hop darker verison of rihanna.  its one of her only albums i don't have to skip tracks to enjoy.  there is more of a street vibe on this album, and contrary to the common review it isn't a poor me album or an album that derived from what happened with chris brown.  this album is a must have!

THE DESCRIPTION DID NOT SPECIFY THIS ACCURATELY. UNFORTUNATELY SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON A DVD THAT CAN'T BE VIEWED AND DEALT WITH A DISAPPOINTED NEPHEW.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This show is perfect blend of fantasy and medieval political power struggle, watched the first season in a week. Please ignore the reviews that say it's too graphic. This is made for adults. Violence is graphic but not glorified. There are consequences to stabbing people with sharp objects. Watch Twilight if this is too complex or adult for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it and it is very fun and cool and I just loooves it  btw I wants.to play it.more.and more
B004MC8CA2|4.0|like the app especially the reading plans. easy to use. the only issue is that in many verses the first sentence repeats.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Beware. I bought this hoping it would help out with my small living room. I refuse to move my sectional every time I want to play. Did calibrations several times and just can't seem to get this thing right. Tried playing games and the hand movements are really erratic. Jumps all over the place.  My Kinect is mounted on top of the tv. I can't mount below because I have a 5:1 surround sound and can't place the Kinect infront of speaker.  Save yourself the money. Do not buy. Wish I didn't open it and returned it instead. Wishful thinking I guess when I opened it.
0061992860|4.0|I hope I never need this.  Its a good size for having on hand.  It covers most normal scenarios.  However, it does not seem to cover surviving the aftermath of a nuclear blast.  So, it did not cover everything I wanted.  Its good to have around, but I'll still need something that covers surviving after a nuclear attack. (No, it didn't cover the Zombie Apocalypse either, but just watch \\"The Walking Dead\\" a few times and you'll have that covered.)
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This use to be a good app but now every time I use it if freezes on the first or second level. I am running this on the verizon samsung galaxy nexus. Please fix this asap, and I will rate it 5 stars again
0920668372|5.0|I bought \\"Love You Forever\\" for my now 8 year old son when he was a baby. It is a beautiful, poignant story that documents the profound bond that exists between mother and child. It ends by completing the circle into the next generation between father and daughter. Everytime I read this book to my son I get choked up -- and that doesn't happen often. I plan to read it to my 18 month old daughter very soon.  I was both amazed and flabbergasted at how some view this book. But the world contains all types of people with their own unique ways of thinking. Perhaps people who view this book as warped or perverted are judging the book through their own warped and cynical view of the world. Or maybe some folks just take things very, very literally. At any rate, it's a shame that some just don't get it. Simply put, it's a great children's book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game sometimes a bit frustrateing at times tho, but still a good way to pass the time. includes tons of different games.

1616416106|4.0|This a great book to introduce children to the many famous stories of Sherlock Holmes as they are such an important part of mystery book history.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I just got this little (about 1\\" x 1\\" x 1/8\\": tiny) device. Once I figured it out (with the help of some reviews here) I'm impressed with the sound boost and clarity.<br />For anybody who can be technically challenged like me, some hints:<br /><br />* Charge the unit using the USB connection. It won't work with zero charge.<br />* To turn it on: Press UP the switch and hold until the unit lights up.<br />* Push up and release to change settings. Flip the unit over to find the tiny blue/red/purple light.<br /><br />I wish instructions came with the unit. At first I thought it didn't work :((
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I'm writing this on behalf of my computer store selling and supporting mac and PC.  1st, this comes with softwares for operating system that are 4 or more years old.  2nd, comes with mini disc that will only work in PC with tray loading, so mac users need external dvd player.  3rd, it doesn't have softwares for wither win 7 or Mac os x 10.6.8 or 10.7 even though it says it does.  4th, looking on realtek website, none of the download link works for the drivers.  I wasted an hour of my super busy schedule and even if it works after that, its worth less piece of product for the headache and buggy software.  ZERO STARS!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is the type of game for players of all ages and interests. From chess to D&D to Halo this is a cool game that has much more strategy involved in it then you would think. We started playing a few weeks ago and have played a bunch of times since then. Bought the 5-6 expansion and have a blast with the kids and their friends (17-18). It was really a great find and I truly think it's a perfect way to get families and friends back to something simple and fun!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I play this game everyday it is so addicting and not just for younger kids. I would reccomend this game for anyone that needs to waste a ton of time. :)... I hate this word limit though....
B005DZ35RC|5.0|I enjoyed the modern-style refresh that they gave this movie and thought that Johnny Depp did a great job in the lead role.  The other characters did an admirable job at capturing the personality and character of the original cast.  This makes for a nice complement to the original to have in your collection.
0307477479|4.0|I usually do not read reviews of books before I read them because I like to form my own opinion. However, this is one book for which I wish I had made an exception. The book is heavy on literary technique. I was about half-way into it before I realized that the book read as a group of connected short stories. At times it was frustrating navigating the non-linear nature of the book as well as keeping track of the many, many characters (the book is NOT mainly about Sasha,  Bennie, and Lou as some reviews state). As I read the last chapter, the author's theme of the nature of time and its passage were fully realized. By the end of the book, I was reflecting back on my own life and the changes that have come as well as the many people who have touched my life either in a large or small way. The fact that this book lead me to my own realization of the \\"goon squad\\" left me feeling as if this book was an absolute work of genius.  Seldom has a book lead to such a personal response from me.
0812550706|5.0|A buddy of mine recommended this book and I love him for it. I'm not a big sci-fi reader but this book kept me locked in from start to finish. I was proud of myself for figuring out the end before it was revealed but I think that is why I enjoyed this book so much. I think Card and I are of like minds. I loved the unorthodox strategies that Ender implemented and his siblings controlling the political fight at home while he controlled the battle out in space was just great. I think my face still hurts from not being able to stop grinning the whole time I read this book.
1594744769|5.0|I loved this book. Not a horror story as I expected, more Mystery/action type. Have already recommended it to friends.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|I have tried many plans over time and have been able to keep my weight the same as it was in high school.  I am now 62 and menopausal.  I had tough fat to get rid of even though it was only ten pounds that I am talking about.  The protein worked and the maintenance is great.  Items I used to want I don't, even though I am now allowed to have some.  I did have items that are traditional Thanksgiving and Christmas season foods and did gain two pounds back but now I just use the plan for a few days and they melt back away.  It took me longer to loose than it should have but I cheated and had one to two glasses of wine while still loosing.  No alcohol is the real plan in the beginning, but if everything else is followed with walking, etc. then it worked, at least for me.  Good solid nutritional advice and life long plan that works!
B004QK5N5W|5.0|This product is excellent. I really enjoy streaming different video feeds and watching them directly on the TV. It is very convenient and works great.

B004YXE438|5.0|I do love this app. I only wish the peaceful music also played during the puzzle. Can't install last update tho.
B0040HJNKC|3.0|I know complaining about a cd sounding \\"too contemporary\\" when it came out in 2010 is somewhat retarded on my part. Here are my reasons for not liking this particular cd all that much.<br />I'm really into Buddy Guy and blues in general. There is a particular sound which I indentify most with, like a Magic Sam or Luther Allison or Albert Collins. I own 5 other Buddy Guy albums, all are \\"older,\\" and I really like those as well. After my first listen to this CD, I thought it sounded way too overproduced and like the bumper music you would hear when Jay Leno goes to a commercial break. Very just, plain. It sounds good, but I don't feel it has any SOUL to it. I didn't really strike me in a way that other great blues CD's had. The songs are all very well put together and the lyrics and singing and guitar playing are top-notch. This is just my opinion, and I was highly persuaded to buy this CD based on the reviews, and it just turns out to be not my particular taste based on it sounding too overproduced and soulless. I would highly recommend his other album \\"Hoodoo Man Blues\\" instead. This is obviously not a criticism of Buddy Guy's entire catalog and shouldn't be a review based on that,for or against. It's just a review of this particular album. Obviously a lot of people like this album, and it's not bad, but if you're into a more \\"dirty,\\" old-school type of sound, you may not enjoy this CD that much. If you are into newer sounding, bombastic, highly stylized, \\"noisy\\" blues, you will very much love or appreciate this album.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ok game...pretty fun makes time pass. you do have to unlock the games but that makes you more determined and the game a little more fun!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game!&lt;3 its perfect for wasting time!(: its one of the best free games I've ever seen! you should definitely download it! ! !
B004WR125O|1.0|I bought this adapter because I liked the idea of being able to access files on my computer. On installation, it offered two set-up methods; auto, & manual. I opted for the manual 1st since I used a WEP password. It wouldn't connect. OK, so I tried the auto. In the set-up it has two options, a push button WPA set, or the option of entering an onscreen code into the router. My router doesn't have the button function, and I couldn't figure how to put this code into the router.So I returned to the manual set-up to try again, but it was no longer \\"seeing\\" my wi-fi network. It had a message saying \\"access point not found\\". I switched back to auto set-up, and now the code is missing. So, somehow this piece of worthless junk has managed to render itself, useless. I have a Mac book, Kindle Fire, and a Vizio HD TV that all stream wi-fi with no problem at all. If you are thinking of this type connection, you may want to try the TP-Link wireless adapter mentioned in another review. I can't comment on that one as I haven't tried it, but it seems to have solved his problem.
B00005JLKB|5.0|This product was very well priced and it came in absolutely pristine condition for a used item. I would highly recommend this.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|I upgraded to an iPhone 4s from the 3G recently, and purchased an OtterBox Defender case for it.  Suddenly, I couldn't dock my phone anymore in my Sony ICF-CS10iP clock radio.  With this, I can dock my phone and use my alarm clock again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is similar to the game on most computers..very enjoyable..and, besides...it is free..a nice way to kill time anywhere.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|A classic, timeless album from the greatest rock and roll band the world has ever known. This 1965 release is the first in the series of great albums from the Beatles.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|This thing is great. I don't have to take off my otterbox to listen to Pandora on my ihome. I do try and have something behind the phone because it sits up a bit higher than it's supposed to without the stubz. It charges my phone and is exactly what I was wanting. Thanks!!
0525478817|5.0|Never in all my life has a book affected me the way 'The Fault In Our Stars' has. I became so enveloped with the story, the characters and their strength. After I finished reading, I felt as if I lost my best friends. The quotes in this book are fabulous as well as the lessons the characters learn. I will forever keep them with me.
B002KGKH5A|4.0|I was not a White Stripes's fan, but I became more interested in their music after seeing Jack in the movie It Might Get Loud.<br />I love that movie and I found this one very interesting too. Jack is a very clever guy and he is very in love with guitars and rock.<br />The scenes off stage and on stage are very well balanced and I loved the Northern landscapes and atmosphere.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game cannot put it down I play it every day and every night but do not play a random play because you may not be able to win.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I really love this movie, I already saw it three times. I never was a Led Zeppelin fan, but I always respected Jimmy Page. I liked U2 until Zooropa, then I moved on. I like White Stripes, even if I think there was too much hype on them. But after seeing this movie my respect for all these three guitarists grew, and I am back to listening some of their things.<br />I the movie they interact in a very funny way, it's cool how they are different in everything, age, origins, look, everything besides being in love with guitars and rock.<br />The movie is well built, showing in parallel three different approach to music and guitar.<br />I don't know about other people, but if you like guitars this is a movie you should mot miss.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is better than angry birds!All they need to do with this on kindle fire is do all the updates on apple I touch.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. It has many choices of games you can unlock by using points you get in the other games. Best of all, you earn 5000 points every day when you get on.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this 101-in-1 game is awesome. there are so many games so you wont ever get bored with it. The only bad thing about this game is the amount of point you have to have to go to the next level of games but all in all its a really fun game.
0439023521|4.0|I had no problem suspending disbelief with respect to there being no significant rebellions in the book which deals, after all, with a mere microcosm in the space and time of the story arc, nor did I have a problem with the rationale for the \\"hunger games,\\" which seems to recapitulate the typical historical explanations for the gladiatorical spectacles of the Roman Empire.  The only bone I have to pick with the author has to do with the protagonist's (Katniss) temporary loss of hearing in one ear.  This should actually have been a very serious problem, of which the author is obviously not aware, since it occurs at a critical juncture in the storyline.  Deafness in one ear would mean that she cannot tell direction of sound, a possibly fatal condition for Katniss, since she is in a life-and-death struggle, not only as a hunter, but as the hunted.  In stalking her prey and being stalked, however, Katniss seems to magically hear stereophonically anyway.  I enjoyed the book in spite of having a problem suspending disbelief on what was to me a very important point.  I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
B001BFFTO0|3.0|I've had these boots for a little over a year now (burnished brown, size 13) and think they look fantastic. Unfortunately, I've had to take them to my local shoe repair guy twice to sew the tongue back on; once for each boot. I'm also concerned with how quickly the soles seem to be wearing out. I only use them for hiking and driving to the slopes and the midfoot of both soles is already bald. Luckily, they can be resoled. Maybe it's just a one off incident with my boots, but I feel like boots that cost $160 should require a little more mileage before seams to start tearing and soles need repairing.  They do look pretty damn sexy though.
B000J103WK|5.0|I'd give it 10 stars! This was the first High-Def video I purchased (back when HD/DVD was still around) and it absolutely blew me away! The picture quality is beyond superb and the 5.1 audio is the best I have ever heard. My surround sound system does not do it justice! Watching this video makes you feel that you are there in the audience. It really is too bad it has not been released in Blu-Ray (yet? Ever?). I use this disk as my demo disk when I really want to show people what High-Definition is all about. If any Eagles fans read this, it would be worth it to try and find a HD/DVD player (they should be pretty cheap these days) and get a copy of this disk. Believe me, you won't be disappointed! Oh, I forgot to mention, the concert itself is priceless!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for quick break; options to personalize for difficult or easy as well as pick card design and background color.

B000ASATZ8|5.0|Tremors...first date my wife and I went on was to see this. We watch it ever year now on our anniv. Subtle and over the top funny mixes well. If you tend to take things a little too serious then it might not be for you. Tremors 2, 3 and so on not as good, but sort of cool to see how bad Hollywood is welling to go to make a little extra off anything they can. Waiting to see if they remake this and what it would look like. We'll see.
0062011847|1.0|This book shouldn't have been published - it's not the Discworld Pratchett's fans have grown to love. The characters are mean and crude is the best way I can describe the problem and the story jerks along. I'm very sorry Terry Pratchett's suffering from Alzheimers - I've seen that first-hand and it's devastating. Pratchett's fans are lucky in one respect and that is there are many Discworld books to re-read anytime we need a break from now. I wish Terry and his family the best.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Sure most of you have never heard of this little move series before, but do not be put off by it's ability to fly under the radar. It was actually pretty darn cool. Considering that it was based on a series of books(?)...do people still read? it was surprisingly entertaining. Honestly, if you don't know about Harry Potter and need to read a review about it then you should probably try and get out of the giant cave you've been hiding in since Y2K. Seriously, you're still reading this? Go. Go away. Beat it. Go watch this and you can then write a review for others to get bummed on...or like. Whatever.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This is just what I wanted for my Kindle Fire.  It's great looking and protects my device.  I like the fact that it has an old book look to it and if I lay it down, it seems to work well in my decor rather than make me look like a slob.  The one I received fits the Kindle snug and was not at all difficult to get into the tabs.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this case. It fits perfectly, while I was a bit concerned before I got it based on some reviews, I have to say that it works great. It is a bit tight when first putting the kindle in it but it sits secure in the case. I also love the fact that when I am holding my kindle it looks like a book. It is so pretty and \\"old world\\" elegant.  I thought there would be a problem with it being opened and in the way but I flip it back, inside out when holding the device and put it right side out when done and it holds it shape very well.  I have to say that besides my kindle fire, this is the best purchase I have make in regards to accessory items for the kindle. I love it so much. It is also durable, little hands don't seem to damage it and with a damp, no overly wet cloth, one can wipe it down.  I would recommend this product to anyone that has a kindle fire and wants to keep it safe and nice. I had bought a skin for my kindle but i keep it in this cover all the time so the skin was a waste of money, oh well!  This case is a great addition to your kindle purchase...oh and the straps do not block the sound at all.
0646497855|5.0|I only had one day to prepare for IELTS. Mostly due to my job and procrastination. So the day before the test I panicked and bought 2 IELTS books from local library and I must say, without this book I would not have scored 8 ! The other books had all the CD and many practice tests but was not as good as this one.<br /><br />Yes the book is not very wordy and it might have been better for some people, but for people like me who already speaks english but do not want to suffer in the listening and writing, this is the best book to get. And having lesser page was rather helpful for me since I had very little time.<br /><br />Buy this book if you have little time and read and practice at least once - you will surely get at least 7 if not 7.5 or 8.<br /><br />Edit: Years later in 2015 I had to go for IELTS again and this time I had even lesser time (a night before test!).<br />Went back to the book again and this time I scored 8.5
0765348276|5.0|The idea of rejuvenation, somehow extending the human lifespan, is enormously appealing as a science fiction trope (it does double duty as an apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic trope). The only way this idea can work in reality of course, is if we have someplace (a lot of someplaces would be nice) to put all the extra people (we already have that problem on a small scale and no good solution... thus the whole apocalyptic genre). Off world travel, off world colonization, is one (and probably the only realistic) long-term solution. But.. we've lost our way on that front... apparently preferring to froth at the mouth about homosexuals and religion as our world ever more rapidly sinks into the cesspool of our own waste, mismanagement and over-exploitation, etc... but I digress...  [[ASIN:0765348276 Old Man's War]] John Scalzi; an updated version of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers with better technology (or at least updated), better characters, a better storyline, a better love story, and of course the potential for sequels... this was a reread for me, but I haven't read any of the sequels so I thought I would start over at the beginning (plus I recall really liking the story, so I didn't mind rereading on that account as well).
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a really fun app.  A nice alternative to regular solitaire or Free Cell!  I can't stop playing it.

0142414999|5.0|I still can't stop smiling because of this book. Seriously, it is one of the cutest books ever! Go read it. Now. You're wasting your time reading this really short review when you can be smiling about how amazing the book is.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|My husband & I watched this movie over the weekend. I was pleasantly surprised as I had purchased & recorded it for myself, figuring it would be a \\"chick flick\\" that my husband wouldn't be interested in. However he ended up watching the movie with me & we both really enjoyed it, as a matter of fact he requested I keep the recording instead of deleting like we normally would.    I have read many reviews of the movie & book & while most are glowing reviews there, as always, are naysayers as well. It seems that most of the complaints have had to do with not going into enough detail with serious issues that were going on at the time. Yes there were serious issues that were happening & there have also been many books & movies that have dealt with things that were happening at the time. However I think that it has a pretty accurate portrayal of how life actually occurs. When there are issues taking place in the world is that all you talk about & focus on in every day life? Not most people, there are serious issues going on now. Does everyone spend all day, every day talking about the war in Iraq or Afghanistan?? Do we spend all of our time talking about & focusing on the awful mess our country is in financially? No because as much as it may concern us we have our lives to live. Working, raising children, making dinner etc. We can't spend all day every day dwelling on it & we spend time with our friends having fun & laughing. So yes while it does skim over the seriousness of the Civil Rights movement taking place at the time, that is not what the movie/book is supposed to be about or claims to be about. It simply states that it is SET in the time period. It is meant to be about the black maids & that's what it is. Skeeter, while the main character, is not meant to be a heroine. She is simply a writer trying to make her way after college & thinks the story of the help will be a good one. No not all of the characters are deeply developed but since when are ALL of the characters ever fully developed? There are always people who drift in & out of any story, some we could do without & some that we wish would get more time.    Other complaints were things like telling Skeeter's problems & trying to put them on par with what the maids went through. I don't think it did this at all, it just simply was showing that we all have troubles. You & I might not have the same problems does that mean that mine or yours are any less meaningful? I think that many people writing awful reviews expected something different & when that's not what they got were very upset.    Over all I would have to say that this movie is about the relationships between black women & white women set in the early '60's. It shows the good & the bad, there are hard times & there are laughs along the way. It is in no way a historical reference to the civil rights' movement. If you are looking to watch a movie that will make you shake your head, laugh & maybe even cry then you will enjoy this movie.
0553801473|4.0|While I disliked having to wait five years for A Dance with Dragons as much as anyone else, I wasn't too disappointed with the experience of reading it. In fact, I was thrilled just to be immersed in George R.R. Martin's gritty, living world again, and to revisit my favorite characters (Tyrion, Jon Snow, Daenyrs, and a few others) and locations. I couldn't put down the audiobook (well, the device containing it).<br /><br />In case you've been living under a rock for the past decade (or don't read much fantasy), I join the many readers who regard the first three books in The Song of Ice and Fire series as landmark works in modern fantasy, rivaling Tolkien in the sheer force of vision behind them. Of course, Martin doesn't *write* like Tolkien and the nature of his vision is very different. His world hearkens as much back to Robert E. Howard's Romantic Conan the Barbarian mythos, which never needed an explicit good versus evil struggle to define its characters. Martin's is a more grown-up version of that universe, recognizing that there's plenty of drama in humans as they really are, in the constant struggle between survival, pleasure, codes of honor, and realpolitik.<br /><br />The first three books were tough acts to follow, and Martin can be partially forgiven for falling a little short on books four and five. However, the chorus of frustration from fans isn't without merit. Martin kind of painted himself into a corner back in 2004, when he realized that the book he was writing had gotten too long. Rather than edit it down to a more manageable size, he split it in two. A Feast for Crows wound up being an immense novel of in which lots of hitherto minor characters got placed into new intrigues, along with some new characters. Was there was a larger purpose to these minor adventures? Or had the author just gotten swallowed in his own world, convinced that what the reader really wanted on this bus tour through Westeros was more stops, with no roadside stand or historic marker not worth a visit? (Hey, it worked for Patrick Rothfuss.)<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons doesn't really resolve those questions, but at least we get the major characters back, and the things eventually start to pick up steam and head somewhere. Tyrion hitchhikes his way east by a few less-than-ideal arrangements. Jon Snow tries to do his duty while dealing with the conflicting demands of an impatient king. And Theon Greyjoy makes a return, in *very* changed circumstances. As always, the \\"living, breathing\\" world remains brilliantly vibrant and alive, its drama infecting everything that happens in the foreground. For example, there's one sequence in which soldiers are sent on a dreadfully misplanned winter mission, not unlike Napoleon's troops in Russia. While this sequence could have been shorter, the details of cold, starving, weary men were so vivid, I didn't really care -- I was just along for the ride. And the chapters with Daenrys in Myreen illustrate the difficulties of ruling a \\"liberated\\" land in a way that seems not unfamiliar (apparently Martin turned on the news during the past five years). By the time the dragons in the story finally come into their own, we're feeling as ready for it as she is. Too bad so much ends on cliffhangers -- hopefully it will take only three years before we find out what happens.<br /><br />I agree with a few other reader complaints. Martin has slipped into the bad habit of repeating catchphrases (\\"words are wind\\", \\"my name is Reek...\\") and important pieces of information multiple times, from multiple angles, rather than trusting readers to see the connections themselves. The new characters he introduces aren't terribly interesting, and there's little tension (for now) over the possibility that our old favorites will die, as they have in the past. I wouldn't have minded a little more exploration of strange and wondrous things (e.g. the ruins of Valyria). Finally, while I think that the level of violence and cruelty inMartin's world has been necessary in shaping his characters, there are places in this novel where it borders, unsettlingly, on gratuity.<br /><br />On the audiobook experience, I had very mixed feelings. Overall, Roy Dotrice's grandfatherly tones are a great fit for Martin's writing, but, to my ears, he gets some voices horribly wrong. Young women sound like old hags or Monty Python members in drag. Too many knights sound like Long John Silver, and Tyrion could be a leprechaun. For the first hours, I was tempted to give up and get the print edition, but, luckily, my ears adapted. In general, I'm pretty tolerant of less-than-perfect readers for audiobooks -- your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Yet, all that said, I remained hooked on the series, and even a flawed entry is one I can't put down. Martin has tested us with two long novels of buildup, buildup, and more buildup, but I remain hopeful that the tour bus will be getting back on the highway and heading towards the big destinations that his fans signed on for.<br /><br />***1/2
B004IZMQI2|5.0|This is a must-read for any writer, artist, athlete or anyone else who's struggling to overcome fear and resistance in order to do something great.  The book won't give you a ton of practical advice on how to do it, but it will help you understand the feelings and fear that are keeping you from it. And it will inspire you to push past it.  The last section of the book gets a little strange and spiritual. Some might find it \\"out there\\" a bit, but if you can open your mind and understand what the author is trying to get across, I think you'll still find he makes some good points.  As a writer, this book has been recommended to me so many times I felt I had to read it. It didn't disappoint. Everyone should read it so they can understand how they sabotage themselves and stop doing it.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I listen to lots of music. But I rarely write reviews on music that I have listened. That's because I don't think good music can be described by words. There are two types of music I most often listen to, extremely masculine music such as heavy metal and thrash metal, and extremely feminine music with angelic female voice such as Celtic Woman. Before I bought this CD, I had watched Celtic Woman's concert titled \\"Believe\\" on PBS. It was an absolutely ravishing performance. I think they really should make a blu-ray version in addition to the DVD version. While all four performers have beautiful stage presence and incredible charisma, Chloe seems the leading type. Compared to their first concert, which was more purely singing, their recent concerts including the \\"Believe\\" concert have more performing elements, which brings more viewing pleasure. While I like all the songs in this album, I have been particularly enthralled by \\"A Woman's Heart\\". I was completely carried away by the performance of that song. I look forward to their live concert in Houston on April 16. I noticed some complaint regarding the video quality of the DVD. I feel so fortunate to have recorded every Celtic Woman concert except the first one from PBS through my Tivo device. I have burned them into disks. They have 1080p video quality.

0307346617|4.0|I did like this one surprisingly. I say surprisingly because this is ultimately a documentary of what happened in 'World War Z' and had great potential of being boring. I thought it was a nice change up in writing style. Considering the fact that all of these personal statements, made by different individuals involved, were conducted after the war was 'over' it didn't have the excitement or in the moment terror that I always love in a zombie novel. Despite the fact that I didn't enjoy the political aspects, they were nonetheless extremely interesting as they were detailed and very thorough. Everything was covered quite comprehensively in this book; it could be an actual testimonial of a real zombie war.<br /><br />I had attempted to read this book before but failed to get very far; I found it hard to read something written in such a way. The audiobook was completely different for me. The audiobook added more to the story than was present in the `print' story. Each individual making their statement regarding what happened was spoken by a different individual rather than the narrator alone using different voice inflections. This was my favorite part and what made it even more real for me.<br /><br />Definitely a winner for any zombie lover out there.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I guess I had expected this movie to be mostly a comedy as I had not read the book. Instead I found it to be a powerful drama with wonderful performances and beautifully directed. In some ways it reminded me of another movie about that time in the south, The Long Walk Home. Sissy Spacek was also in that movie giving another amazing performance.  The Help is a true jewel, a perfect picture of that time in the south. I know because I lived in the south during that time. I lived in Montgomery, Alabama during the bus strike. And, as the movie states, Mississippi was, indeed, the longest hold out state with the worst conditions for blacks. I believe that a movie like this is very important now when enough time has gone by that a lot of people don't even remember what times were like back then. Even young African Americans don't really know what it was like or having been told by parents and grandparents don't really believe it. I bought this movie expecting light entertainment and thinking I would be disappointed that it wasn't better but I was  very surprised at the way it was done. This is an excellent movie, very moving and heartbreaking most of the time, and very funny at other times. It was very honest in the fact that the young man who was interested in her deserted her when her book made her \\"notorious\\" in his eyes. She just didn't fit into his idea of what a southern woman should be like.  But, she kept her eye on her future.  An excellent movie, more than lives up to the hype. I recommend it to everyone.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|From the very first chapter, you feel the unbelievable upheaval that the Hunger Games bring to Katniss Everdeen's life. Over the course of three books, the author takes you to the ultimate high, down to the emotional lows of losing friends, family, partners, and even enemies. This series should make us all take a second look at how we view both war and human suffering. Great read all the way through, and I already can't wait to read it again!
B0053B347M|5.0|This is a nice white led strip for soft ambient glows.  Works nicely for a 22 in LCD monitor.  I purchased 2 for my monitor and it looks nice.  The light lvls are of course a personal preference and some will like it and others will not.  But for under $10 these are definitely worth a try.  I had to move my lights a few times until i found a lighting configuration that i liked best but still the best under $20 ambient lighting I have found.  Pros!  -Cheep  -Double side tape  -6 decently bright LED's nicely spaced.  -USB plug and play NO drivers needed!  -Can be plugged into a monitor with USB capabilities for power.  Cons!  -no on/off controls.  -some may say to dark/bright no way to adjust brightness.  -They stay on if you have them plugged into your PC's USB even with the PC powered (due to the constant power being supplied to a MOB by the PSU).  A little Tip.  For those who had not noticed like i did, there is a protective thin plastic strip that covers the entire LED strip.  it is thin like cellophane.  Once removed the lights seem to be exceptionally brighter and clearer just a little FYI if you guys hadn't noticed.

I love reading about them but at the same time thanking everyone i know and God, too, that this is not my life...<br /><br />There is not any spoiler here in saying that a young boy is found dead in a local park.  It is a well to do supposedly safe community and this still happens...a week goes by without a hint or clue as to who might have done this.<br /><br />Now we come to Andy Barber.  He is the district attorney with a lovely wife and  a son in the same school...same grade...everyone is grieving but at the same time thankful that it did not happen to them.<br /><br />Andy and his wife adore their son...who in the opening pages seems a bit aloof and off.<br /><br />Later...Jacob...the son...is accused of murdering his classmate.<br /><br />OMG...sounds horrible in real life...but mesmerizing in a novel.<br />The book gets intense...and by that I mean literally heart pounding from the moment Andy begins reading his son's Facebook pages...to secretly searching his son's room and finding what will ultimately cause his life to destruct.<br /><br />I truly hate doing this but I can't really say much more...this book is one of those page turners that is almost impossible to put down.<br /><br />I have read and fretted over every word in this amazing book...<br /><br />It is thought provoking...it is sometimes difficult to read but you will not be sorry that you did.  You will be involved with this family until the explosive conclusion.

0061969656|4.0|I am a long-standing fan of Bernard Cornwell, having read everything he's written, and always looking forward to the next book in a series.  The  latest installment in the Saxon series, however, was not my favorite.  This is definitely not the book to start off with, as there are just so many characters and back stories.  I am hoping Cornwell will move us farther along in  Uhtred's life.  The endless bickering and tribal warfare has gotten a little repetitive, and I am intrigued to learn more of Uhtred's later years.  We get several hints about his family and his eventual recovery of his home Bebbanberg: This would be very interesting to me.  Historical novels do portray historical events, but it is the ongoing characters that keep me interested. I don't know anything about the actual personalities of Edward or his relatives, and who could at this distant date?, but very much want to know how Uhtred manages to regain the fortress that was his home.  I still gave this 4 stars , however, because Cornwell is such a great storyteller that I was intrigued and hated to put it down until finished.

0312641893|3.0|Cinder is one of those books that had me hanging on every word one minute but then I was able to set it aside for a few days the next.<br /><br />It starts out fantastic when we are plunged into the crazy cool world of futuristic New Bejjing and meet a truly unique protagonist in Cinder.<br /><br />\\"The screw through Cinder's ankle had rusted, the engraved cross marks worn to a mangled circle. Her knuckles ached from forcing the screwdriver into the joint as she struggled to loosen the screw one gritting twist after another. By the time it was extracted far enough for her to wrench free with her prosthetic steel hand, the hairline threads had been stripped clean.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm sure I'll feel much more grateful when I find a guy who thinks complex wiring in a girl is a turn-on.\\"<br /><br />At first I was utterly enchanted with this retelling of Cinderella. Who wouldn't be? Cinderella as a gifted mechanic cyborg with a metal foot replacing the glass slipper, her Prince Charming - Kai, forced to rule his country before he is ready, a dash of dystopian with a steampunk vibe in a plague ravished New Bejjing plus a potential war with the Lunars from the Moon Empire.<br /><br />Then about halfway through the blending of genres weighed down the story. The dark gritty overtones that I enjoyed early on clashed with the pivotal lead up to the \\"ball\\". It felt forced to me. As in Cinderella, the ball is where all the various threads are tied together and it felt like no matter how bad things were getting around them people kept getting sidetracked by this ball as a chance to snag a dance with Kai. There are a lot of interesting concepts going on that I felt didn't have the time to be fully explored in this novel. Particularly the alien Lunar people. I also didn't feel like the author utilized the setting of futuristic Bejjing very well. Aside from a few references to things like bonsai and emperors  there wasn't much to immerse me in this unique culture and setting. I almost felt like the story was taking place in the US at times.<br /><br />There is a big mystery as to who or what Cinder really is but most readers could guess the truth very early on with the heavy dose of foreshadowing. I'm not sure if that was the authors intent but it took away some of the mystery and interest for me as a reader.<br /><br />The story is told mainly from Cinder's point of view with occasional chapters from Kai and other characters POV's. Everyone is quite likable/interesting. Kai and Cinder have a slow blossoming relationship which was nice but almost everyone was just ok in my opinion. I wasn't irritated by anyone but there wasn't anyone who stood out for me either except for Iko, Cinder's funny cyborg BFF.<br /><br />The ending really amps things up and is a bit of a cliffhanger but a tolerable one. I particularly liked Kai's reactions to the fallout out from the ball. It wasn't your typical YA hero response but was more realistic to me.<br /><br />I honestly can't say anything bad about the story or the writing. Cinder is a good book that I think will appeal to most readers but for some reason it just didn't grab me and hold my attention. I would probably read the sequel at some point just to see where the story goes.times.

B006LNOOW0|5.0|This is a delightful animated movie largely due to the very excellent voice acting of Jack Black as the panda, Po. Mr. Black really animates Po, who's big-hearted, loyal, ingenuous and resilient. Gary Oldman as the villainous peacock, Shen, is also great. The animation is superb, as is the soundtrack, and the 3D is very well done. I liked this movie much better than the first though I know there's some difference of opinion here. I hope that if there's a third movie, however, that the Furious Five will be given more lines and more involvement. Their characters need to be more developed . . .

0439023521|4.0|I really enjoyed the audio book, but one thing started to really annoy me. The author *constantly* used the word 'say' or 'says' in the dialogs.<br /><br />For example, a common dialog would be:<br />\\"blah blah\\" says Peeta<br />\\"blah blah\\" I say<br />\\"blah blah\\" says Peeta<br />\\"blah blah\\" I say<br /><br />It's not always necessary to mention who is talking. If there are only 2 people in a dialog, it's obvious who is talking without having to use the word \\"say or \\"says\\".<br /><br />And she could have used other words, such as:<br />\\"blah blah\\" I laughed<br />or<br />\\"blah blah\\" Peeta pointed out<br /><br />But she constantly used \\"say\\" or \\"says\\" and it sounded so amateur. It started grating on my nerves and I starting cringing whenever I heard it. Maybe I was overly sensitive about it since it was an audio book.<br /><br />Besides that, I liked the book although I can't understand why it's considered a young adult book. No way this is the type of book for young adults!!!! Just because the book is about a 16 year old, doesn't make it a young adult book.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Here is an example from page 40 that shows what I mean with the overuse of the word 'say':<br /><br />\\"Yes, there's usually some,\\" I say.<br />\\"Katniss, it's just hunting. You're the best hunter I know,\\" says Gale.<br />\\"It's not just hunting. They're armed. They think,\\" I say.<br />\\"So do you. And you've had more practice. Real practice,\\" he says. \\"You know how to kill.\\"<br />\\"Not people,\\" I say.<br />\\"How different can it be, really?\\" says Gale grimly.<br /><br />6 lines of dialog...the word 'say/says' used 6 times!

B004EPYZU8|1.0|I love action movies. I love fantasy. I love giant robots and samurai. I love over the top mashups of steam punk awesomeness. This movie wanted to be those things, but turned out to be the most boring movie I've seen in a long time. Yeah, that's right. Boring. There was no characterization for build up so the climaxes and dangers didn't seem real or important. Plus most of it was happening in someone's head, and it was totally unclear if there were any consequences until more than half way through the movie.<br /><br />It was more like watching extended fan service. Here's the thing though, fan service is good because you're already a fan of something and it's hidden in between an actual story. This was just a lot of shots of robots and panties and boobs.<br /><br />I'm not even going to touch how uncomfortable I was by thinking that these women were escaping the horrors of strip clubs by imagining they were dying in a war somewhere to weird techno remixes of old classics. That was...awkward.<br /><br />I've been told I didn't like it because I didn't 'get it.' No. I assure you I 'got' the shallow, uncomplicated, psuedo-pschological bologna sauce. It just wasn't good or interesting or well written. It was like someone let the director film an extended version of his sexual fantasies and no one at any point said, \\"This is a terrible idea.\\"

B004V6MWFU|5.0|If there's one thing which is undeniable about pearl jam's lead singer is how much he has matured through his 20 years of ongoing career.  His lyrics were already incredibly well written on their debut album but as the years went by, for those who followed, his writting  just kept improving. This CD is not just a proof of that but also a proof of how talented Eddie Vedder is, going from his Rock and intense tunes  to smooth and charismatic Ukulele tunes. This CD is a MUST for those who followed and even for those who are just getting to know this amazing  musician and human being.
B005VTGB0S|4.0|I have a few iPad 2 cases.  One, a Speck HandyShell, cost about double this one.  The other case is an inexpensive silicone &#34;gel&#34; case which offers general protection, but no stand options.  I really like the Speck case and its &#34;beer tab&#34; easel option which allows for a lot of angle flexibility when standing the tablet up.  But again, it does cost almost double this one AND it lacks a front cover.<br /><br />As far as the AmazonBasics case itself, it appears durable and the leather feels rigid enough to offer protection, but still soft to the touch.  The inside is a soft gray &#34;velvety&#34; material.  The case has a &#34;portfolio&#34; look to it, and looks professional when bringing your iPad to meetings, etc.<br /><br />The iPad fits into four elastic corner holders so it is protected completely on the back, and on the front when the case is closed.  The sides of the iPad, although technically exposed, do not extend beyond the case edges, so for most purposes the sides are protected as well.  I say most because rain or other moisture could get to the iPad from the sides if you are standing in a downpour.<br /><br />As far as functionality, the case easily accepts the iPad and the stand/cover works well, folding to either cover, or allow angled viewing of, the iPad.<br /><br />Like most covers of this type, the corner holders tend to make it hard to operate the physical power or volume buttons.  That is not an issue on my other cases as they provide a membrane area or outer button to access the iPad controls. There are no cut outs on the case, such as for the speaker. These &#34;control access&#34; issues are minor trade offs for more overall protection of your iPad.  Still, if you tend to use the buttons a lot, take note! The rear camera lens, on the other hand, is completely covered when the iPad is in the case, so that's a big minus.<br /><br />The case also has an outer elastic band which wraps over the case to secure the front cover when you are not using it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very reasonably-priced case which gives the appearance of being more expensive than it is in both looks and feel, but with a couple of design flaws (partial obstruction of buttons, complete obstruction of rear camera).are not using it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very reasonably-priced case which gives the appearance of being more expensive than it is in both looks and feel, but with a couple of design flaws (partial obstruction of buttons, complete obstruction of rear camera).

B000JMKQX0|3.0|First off, I enjoyed this book. Fans of zombie lit will enjoy this book. The book is written as a documentary of interviews with survivors of a zombie plague and as such the book is really best described as a collection of short stories. In most short story collections a few really stand out and a few are forgettable. I found this to be true with this tale. The drawback to this style of storytelling is that the potential to love or hate characters never completely develops and ultimately you move on to the next scene and start over. The stories are not interrelated other than the fact everyone is dealing with zombies which adds to the short story collection feel. It's a zombie tale, there is plenty of gore and thrills, enjoyable read for zombie fans.

B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|The Walking Dead is based on a best-selling comic book, and the first of its kind to hit basic cable television. Never before has anyone pushed the envelope to actually incorporate the intensity of zombie apocolypse violence on cable tv, as the idea of zombies has always been left to full-length motion picture filmmakers. This only pushes the character of the zombie to further affix itself to modern culture hopefully as much as the vampire has. Usually many television shows can easily bring vampires to public audiences, and even to Disney channel ones, only because the violence factor of vampires has always been relatively mild. Anyone doing anything with zombies though, would need to amp up the violence/gore factor, which is perhaps why no one has dared to do it; until of course, The Walking Dead.  This is a fairly short season, consisting of only 6 episodes, and that is a good thing, considering that a season running about 15 to 20 would be way too much. Regular dramas can do this only because the meat of the show itself, killing zombies, would become way too old if overdone. This season feels more like an introduction to the zombies and our characters more than anything else. With that, we have the typical zombie storyline - world becomes overrun at the offset, one protagonist must find his missing family, we meet others along the way, people fight, split, separate, etc. If you have been watching zombie films since George Romero's classic \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" this storyline will not be anything new. What we do look forward to is the characters, their likability, the special effects, etc.  Now, while TWD works, it doesn't revolutionlize anything. The zombies are the star of the show here really, no really our characters. Zombies are made up of a mix of CGI and make-up, making the characters themselves very real, but lots of their guts and gore mostly all computer generated. It is noticeable, and a bit disappointingly so, as I still cannot fathom how even after all these years of CGI we still cannot make splashing and squirting blood real looking enough. Anyway, while the gunplay isn't to the point of a video game splatterfest (although THAT is a full-on action episode I would LOVE to see... even though it would only work for ONE episode, after which it would just get old), it still is heavy enough where a good number of our characters die in some pretty gory ways. I myself was a bit shocked to see such gore could even be shown on television, which is good considering this show really is doing something new. This is definitely for mature audiences, and I wouldn't recommend any children under the age of 17 to be exposed to it (15 if they can take it).  Still, even though our zombies make a good show, our characters and their plots are simply PRETTY good to OK. They all play their parts well, but nobody really GRABS us, makes us jawdrop or wows us in any way. They are just basically people trying to survive, and admist some standard dialogue, mixed with a flair of cheesy writing, we never really are found rooting for our survivors. I must say though that the writers do geniunely try, they just haven't really found that magic as of yet; maybe they will 2nd season.  By the end we sort of end up where we start. I won't give anything away but we are left at the end of the season with simply a good INTRODUCTION to our show, not really much else (really just ONE thing we know will lead to a plot twist in season 2, but just one).  Yet this is a good show, I have to give them credit for their guts (in more ways than one), and one zombie fans will enjoy and take pride in. I'm just hoping for more plot twists and character development as the seasons go on, as this season does it very minimally. As far as a decent drama, it's there, and you can't beat the gore, you really can't. 4 stars really for a progressive idea, ambitious storytelling and action.  As far as extras, it's your pretty standard fare, which isn't bad: interviews with the director, cast and creators, behind the scenes footage of make-up, etc, a run down of each episodes behind the scenes features.  If you want a bigger content of extras I would recommend buying the 3-disc special edition, featuring lots of featurettes about zombies themselves. This I would think more enjoyable considering it most likely would go into the history of zombies in filmmaking, hence talkign about the culture of zombies and them as creatures beyond what this show presents to us. A little pricier but I would think well worth it for the zombie fanatic. All others merely interested in only this show, this BD provides enough.
072325804X|5.0|A beautiful book, the illustrations in it are stunning, the stories wonderful! the paper is thick, makes you feel like you are reading a very old book!  Highly recommend this book!!
B000F8O35U|5.0|It is a good quality movie, arrived fast and is what was expected.  Love the movie and so do my children. Good time to buy while the price is down, before it goes into the vault.
0547391005|5.0|It's a beautiful book, we just got it in the mail and have already read 2 of the stories in it! the fact that it comes with an audio CD of the stories is also great, my youngest loves listening to it on her cd player, i hear giggling as i write this because George is getting into mischief :)  This book is a GREAT buy!!

B000002UAC|1.0|I received the CD promptly and is appears in good shape but the re-mastering was botched. Not one song is clear. Guitars sound like banjos and the vocals sound gravelly. Didn't pay much and not worth much
B004EPZ02A|3.0|I just got the movie and watched it.  Pathetic.  Only word for it.  I graded 3/5 because as a stand-alone movie, it's decent.  As a continuation of the series, it absolutely sucks.  PA1 was great.  PA2 expanded upon PA1, answering some questions and opening up more.  Then we get PA3, which is about as boring as possible.  The first 90% of the movie consists of objects mystically moving on camera, doors mysteriously closing, etc.  Where have we all seen that before?  The ending is at least somewhat interesting, though it's also so obvious what's going to happen it takes all the suspense out of it, which just kills it.  This movie contributes nothing to the franchise other than the revelation that it was the grandmother who made the deal with the demon, which really means nothing since we already knew it was a previous-generations relative.  Oh, and the cliffhanger at the end of PA2, \\"Katie and Hunter's whereabouts remain unknown\\"?  Not answered.  Not even addressed.  Not even so much as an indicator the filmmaker's even remembered it.  I suppose they're just leaving the door open for PA4, which I pray is better than this.

B0059XTUMC|5.0|Who would have thought that in 2011 one of the best movies of the year would be silent!?<br /><br />Old silent movies required the actors to overact, \\"mug\\", to express emotions, let the viewers know what was going on. The \\"Jazz Singer\\" changed all that and revolutionized the movie industry. Acting became much more natural. Many popular actors and actresses were suddenly out of demand as tastes changed with the sound revolution. (Clara Bow, the inspiration for Betty Boop and great sex star of the twenties springs to mind). This movie captures that revolution.<br /><br />The Artist is not quite like the old silents, viewers now are more sophisticated, so the actors don't overact quite as much, there is a sound track here, mostly classical music. The plot seems much more touching. The plot touches upon elements from \\"Sunset Boulevard\\", \\"All About Eve\\" and various Fred Astair movies. Both leads are quite effective in making the audience feel their emotions.<br /><br />Jean Dujardin as George Valentin, the aging silent heroic movie star looks a bit like Clark Gable or Errol Flynn. B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo, as Peppy Miller, the talking newcomer, is charming and funny like Fannie Brice. French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius appreciates the good qualities of black and white silent movies without asking for overacting from his stars.<br /><br />With all the noisy car chases and ultra violence of today's movies The Artist is a refreshing welcome change. A movie with feelings! A movie that will leave you happy. Highest recomendation.

B0059XTUB8|4.0|The protagonist, Eddie Redmayne plays Clark, his story is predictable. A well connected young British university student becomes the assistant assistant assistant director (a go-for) when Marilyn Monroe is in England shooting \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\". He is assigned to follow around the difficult Marilyn and do her bidding. He falls head over heels, but maintains his distance like a medieval knight protecting the Queen.<br /><br />Marilyn is the most popular actress in the world, but full of self doubt. She thinks she's a floozy only hired for her sex appeal.  She hires Lee Strasberg and his wife as an acting coach. (Far as I know, this really happened, or much of it).<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh plays Sir Laurence Olivier, lead actor and director in \\"Prince\\", who has little patience with Marilyn's self-indulgent, druggy ways - full of booze and barbs - arriving hours late to the set. He assigns Clark.<br /><br />The revelation here is Michelle Willliams as Marilyn. At times she sputters, plays Marilyn as a bit too withdrawn and too drugged, but when she connects, when she is firing on all cylinders, Williams is electrifying, you could swear you are seeing the real thing! Doing a little dance for photographers, playing with the smitten Clark.<br /><br />The movie is worth seeing just for these occasional  flashes of real Marilyn

1400052181|2.0|I don't feel, after reading the book, that the Lacks family was mistreated.  Cells are just cells, we don't earn them, they aren't accomplishments.  I know everyone here disagrees with this statement and Amazon wouldn't let me post my first review of this book.  I'm not sure what word I used that was unacceptable since I used no profanity or name-calling.  I guess I didn't come hard enough on the side of poor, abused Lacks family.  Maybe it was that I stated the obvious -- Henrietta had a bad, short life due to her promiscious, diseased husband.

B0053TMP24|5.0|I've got one word to describe it: EPIC!!!!! I loved the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series and was hooked with The Lost Hero. When I heard in The Last Hero that Percy was missing, I thought \\"What happen to Percy this time?\\" and was intrigued by Jason, Piper, and Leo. When I finally got my paws on The Son Of Neptune(via borrowing from good friend) I couldn't put it down. It was exciting and the humor was great. Though I was surprised by Nico being in the Roman camp(though I still wonder where else he goes when he disappears). My favorite new character from the book is Terminus(sorry Hazel and Frank). The Roman God of Boundaries is my kind of comedic character. He is OCD and when he got mad at the giant for crossing the boundary with a weapon, I laughed so hard I thought I was going to split. I recommend this book to all Percy fans and mythology lovers!

B004LWZW4C|2.0|Other than some blatant artistic liberty with the storyline and characters, this was overall 132 minutes of attention keeping X-Men fantasy.  It was a feature I was going to enjoy watching with my kids.  Unfortunately, this movie is soured by the single line uttered by Wolverine during his 4 second cameo. It could have been handled (or written) so much better to fall in line with a PG-13 feature. I'm no prude, and served in the Marine Corps, so I have heard it all, but this F-bomb is SO out of place. I just don't understand why the makers of a film marketed for fans of the comic book franchise, that includes younger kids, would feel the need to push the limits of a PG-13 rating and make it less family friendly. So disappointing. Anyone interested in a slightly used Bluray?
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I am always skeptical about buying any items online.  I've had bad experiences before (never from Amazon.com) .  I looked at all the stores in my town but always they were out of most or all of their cases for the Kindle Fire.  Always plenty for Nook.  So online was the best choice.  I read all the reviews for every case there was to feel good about my purchase.  I narrowed it down to a few but my favorite look and design was this case.  I especially liked having so many colors to choose from, I chose pink, and that it had the stand but was still lightweight, the Kindle Fire is already heavy enough.  I was nervous from all the negative reviews on this case but what made me decide to buy it were the reviews saying how great it was and how they couldn't understand those first few negative reviews.  I received this case yesterday, along with the Amazon Basics Stylus (which is awesome), and the package felt like it was empty it was so light! I couldn't believe how light the case was and yet so sturdy that now I'm not worried anymore if the Kindle gets knocked around a bit or a lot!  It doesn't interfere with using the Kindle and the soft rubber texture feels great. It is very well made!!  It is exactly as was described and it's exactly what I wanted.  I watch TV episodes and movies on my kindle all the time which is why I wanted a case with a stand.  I do not know what the people who have commented on the stand not standing properly or coming out of the slot are talking about!  I've had NO problems!  I have even worked with the case in the stand position sitting on my lap, and not once has it even tried to slip out of place.  I will definitely recommend this case to everyone with a Kindle Fire.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.
B00178I1PU|3.0|I bought this for my five year old for christmas. The quality of the toy met my expectations. I like the wood products over the plastic. My main complaint is that this is pretty dificult to use. There isn't a lip or anything to rest the arrow on, so I had to spend an hour or more teaching my son to shoot it with his finger holding the arrow in place. So he lost interest pretty quick because its already difficult to shoot before even attempting to learn how to aim this thing.

0307352145|5.0|This is the best book on introverts I've read since The Introvert Advantage by Marti Olsen Laney. Cain starts with a history of society's movement towards over-valuing extroversion and then moves on to look at how this is affecting ALL of us, and not just the 1/3 to 1/2 of the population that is introverted. She covers business, education, relationships, and raising children, and shares current research. In each of these topics she covers what is lost when we forget, or refuse to acknowledge, the value of introverts. For example, the CEO of an investing company would benefit from a team that has - and has mechanisms to involve - introverts as well as extroverts, because they offer different strengths for different situations. Perhaps if we had been able to hear from the cautious quiet thinkers we wouldn't have gotten ourselves into quite the economic mess we are now in.  Much of what Cain describes resonated with this introvert reader, showing me \\"myself\\" from the outside, sometimes to a surprising amount. She covers the questions of how to encourage your introvert kids and when to let them be, and how much and when to push yourself as an introvert adult. For example, if an introvert is in a career that necessitates them acting extroverted all the time with no time to recharge, they are going to burn themselves out. But if they can balance their time, and if the reasons they are taking on an extroverted role is for a purpose that resonates with them, then that should be fine.  Sometimes books about introverts can make extroverts look like the dominant boorish counterpart. I appreciated that Cain does not paint with too broad a brush. She talks about the benefits and troubles that both types have, and what they can learn from each other.  This book is clear, readable, and has discussable examples, and I am looking forward to sharing this book with all my fellow introverts (and the extroverts who love them) and their coworkers, and especially parents of  introvert/shy/sensitive kids.  (This review was written for LibraryThing Early Reviewers.)
B00008G7UF|5.0|Meg Ryan, Kevin Kline, Lawrence kasdan, Paris and the South of France...How does it get any better than this?  I saw and loved this film when it came out and recently picked it up at the library.  I rarely watch a film more than once and have, on many occasions been disappinted at seeing a once-favorite that didn't stand the test of time.  But last night when I needed a respite from the worries of the day, I put this in the player and was again, immediately transported to the land of delight where a really good film can bring you.  I won't relate the story---just to add my applause to the others who have enjoyed this film so much.  Meg Ryan shows her remarkable range from sensitive woman to outrageous clown.  She's not afraid to show her vulnerability which endears her so much to the audience. (In my opinion she is a much underrated actress by the \\"professionals\\" who often equate physical beauty with lack of talent.)  Kevin Kline is every bit her match, even more so, as the French bum who fulfills all of her worst stereotypes. In short, he is hilarious! This ia a match made in Heaven and although we know how it will end, these two keep us in the palms of their hands as we watch the drama unfold.  Some here say the script is limited but I found it just complex enough.  There are times when you want to sit back and enjoy the scenery and this is one of them.  And the music---again, just right.  Play through the credits and you'll have the treat of hearing Kline sing \\"La Mer\\" in French.  Someone wrote that Gerard Depardieu refused the part to which I say \\"merci beaucoup.\\"  Meg Ryan was lucky and so were we!  I liked Ryan's two \\"chick-flicks\\" with Tom Hanks but this one far surpasses them.  Kline can act figure-eights around Hanks and does so here.  In fact I think it's a diservice to call this a chick-flick; it far transcends the genre.

B006PZBR8S|4.0|REAL STEEL is a clever movie in that it takes a video game concept (though the idea is from a short story by Richard Matheson interpreted by Jeremy Leven, Dan Gilroy and written for the screen by John Gatins), keeps intact the videogame lovers' approach to fantasy and action, and introduces some adult versions of acting out  that make for a solid message.<br /><br />At first the movie seems trite - a grown man, ex-boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman, buff, surly and in fine acting condition) buys and sells and enters robots who perform in a circus style boxing arena where years earlier real men boxed. We soon discover that this is future-set story where robot boxing is a popular sport and centered on a struggling promoter (Jackman) who thinks he's found a champion in a discarded robot. During his hopeful rise to the top, he also discovers he has an 11-year-old son Max (Dakota Goyo), in the midst of a custody battle with Charlie's deceased wife's sister and husband (Hope Davis and James Rebhorn).  Charlie, ever on the outlook to pay off his debts and find financing for buying new robots to train for boxing matches,  makes a deal with the couple, and agrees to care for Max for a summer while the couple visit Europe.  Max wants to know his father but on his terms.  The two males are aided by the owner of Charlie's training gym - Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) - and it is her intervention that helps the two males join forces and become involved with a discarded robot, Atom, they make a champion by working together.<br /><br />The tenderness of the film takes a while to settle in, but in the end it is not easy to deny that the story of a reluctant father and a self sufficient son finding that arm platform of relationship, able to endure disappointments as well as triumphs.  Jackman and Goyo are a terrific team and the other cast members, especially  Lilly and Anthony Mackie, are solid. Shawn Levy's direction deserves credit for pulling the whole thing together. This is not just another silly CGI flick: there is a core a beauty to the film that makes it not only entertaining but heartwarming, too.

B005LLSZNM|5.0|We have gotten hooked on this series! We have viewed all of the season's 1-3 and saw season 4 was available for purchase. There aren't many good movies to watch/rent out there this winter, so we went with this and have been watching on our ROKU2. I would recommend going with the full season purchase vs. individual, saves you lots of $$. Plus - the streaming is awesome, goes without a glitch! Thanks Amazon!
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|While watching it, I recognized the story from an episode from the twilight zone. This was a remake for kids unfortunately I am not into such movies.  It is a father and son story more then a science fiction story.  The acting overall was a bit wooden. I thought that Evangeline Lilly could have done much better, she is a good actress as could just about everyone else except Hugh Jackman, who acted well.  The filming was very good, the special effects are very good and for this reason I gave it four stars.  Would I recommend it, only to people that are into father and son type movies, would I see it again NO!

0439023491|4.0|Suzanne Collins captivated millions of young readers with \\"The Hunger Games.\\"  Her heroine, Katniss, beat the twisted system imposed by the brutal overlords of the Capitol by winning the Hunger Games - a toxic brew of Thunderdome, the Super Bowl, and Stephen King's \\"The Long Walk.\\"  Not only did she win the Games, she became a symbol of freedom for the millions of oppressed residents of the 12 Districts who toil under the Capitol's merciless iron boot.<br /><br />But just as the Empire came looking for Luke, Han and Leia in \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" the evil Powers That Be in the Capitol seek revenge against Katniss - and they play for keeps.<br /><br />I stayed away from any spoilers before reading \\"Catching Fire\\" and honestly did not predict how evil the Capitol's plan for revenge was.  I saw Katniss as essentially invulnerable after winning the Games - she's a national celebrity and by the rules of the Games, she's entitled to a life of luxury for the rest of her days.  Not only that, the Capitol has a vested interest in keeping her alive, as any untimely death would be deemed suspicious and could cause unrest among the Districts.<br /><br />But thanks to Collins' twisted imagination, the Capitol comes back with a vengeance and a diabolical plan to solve their \\"Katniss problem.\\"<br /><br />If you're thinking that \\"Catching Fire\\" is going to focus solely on Katniss trying to pick between her two suitors - her longtime friend Gale or her Games co-victor Peeta - you couldn't be more wrong.  True, there is some emotional struggle as both Gale and Peeta vie for Katniss's heart, but suffice it to say that Katniss has bigger fish to fry.  There's enough romance here for a legitimate subplot, but this is far from a dreary teen-love tale.<br /><br />This is a worthy \\"Hunger Games\\" sequel - fast-moving, violent, and bleak, filled with fascinating characters and sinister villains.  Highly recommended for mature younger readers.

1451648537|4.0|My wife surprised me with this book for Christmas.  Not something I would have selected on my own.  I found the book very entertaining, inspirational, and at times frustrating for setting the table for a big event and then moving on to another subject.  It was surprising how many times Jobs screwed up, whether it was being ousted from Apple or his misadventures at Next computer.  He lucked out early by connecting with Wozniak and took full advantage of their relationship for the rest of his life.    His attention to detail and focus on perfection was all at once amazing and foolish.  As a business owner, it's inspiring to know that a billionaire makes the same mistakes I make, and it's also something you can learn from.  For example, why fret for days over the precise color of the machines on the assembly line in your factory. On the other hand, his drive to put out amazing products and his demands that all the people around him be A players created one of the worlds best brands, Apple.    The last quarter of the book, during which Steve battle's cancer, is a bit sobering.  Easy to imagine yourself going through that while trying to maintain normalcy in your day to day life.    Bottom line:  Worth a read, especially if you are a manager or own your own business, or are a fan of Apple products.    Doug M  [...]

1585104205|1.0|Not really sure where to begin. First off, the lack of understanding the author creates when it comes to the grammar is beyond frustrating. When I took Latin using this book, it was the end of the 1st semester when I learned that there were things like Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, etc. It was frustrating enough not knowing what these words meant in English, but in Latin...forget it. Secondly, sometimes the pictures were not that clear. The only thing that saved this book from receiving 0 stars (besides the fact that you can't give it 0 stars) was the hilarious picture on page 299.

It can easily hold it's own with any game of it's type, including anything you'll find on the PC. Also, they must have updated, because I have no issues with text in the briefings. The worst thing about Anomaly is that it's spoiled me for other Android games. Worth it's $3.99 price tag and then some. Can't wait to see more from 11 bit studios!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I have the iPhone 4 in white and wanted to actually be able to see the white part of the phone while still having a quality case.  This one fits the bill.  The circle design on the back adds some interest while still being able to see how cool this phone looks.  It's super easy to put on, provides great protection (I've had the case for 24 hours and I've dropped my phone on concrete twice already), and allows enough clearance around the headphone jack for me to plug my headphones in without removing the case - something that my old case from Speck wouldn't allow me to do. AND this thing cost me $8.99, free shipping with Prime.  Can't beat it.
B004LROUW2|4.0|I've read reviews around this book that fall in both sides of the fence, some believe is a masterpiece while others feel it falls short on its promise.  I believe it is not a traditional novel, specially because of the \\"sweep loose plot strands under the proverbial rug\\" issue some people seem to have a problem with.  I agree to some extent, it is hard to imagine a 900+ page novel that fails to resolve some of the most intricate plot issues, which leads me to believe that the author didn't fail, he simply chose not to. And I think that is part of the power in the novel, at the end there are so many things unresolved that you feel like a 4th book is required, yet, if it doesn't exist its ok. The atmosphere at the end leaves no need for further explanation, the 2 main characters reveal their thought process to be beyond the needs for additional input, they are on their own and it will work just like that. All the remaining plots can develop in my head as I wish, so even though the novel is over, the story can continue.  The narrative is extensive, the details exquisite, the ability of the reader to immerse in the world presented by the author will determine the joy experienced or the excruciating pain of going over hundreds of pages with little advancement on the main plot. I thankfully belong to the first class so I don't think I can recommend this book to everyone, only to some people that enjoy losing themselves in a different world, a world with different rules, rules that they can accept as true just because such a world exists.  I feel that if you know more from the author this might not be the best book to read, and I say that because I didn't know anything from the author before taking the book with me. So maybe that helped in that I wasn't expecting anything beyond a good book that would keep me interested from start to finish.  Highlights:  - Narrative  - Thought process of the characters  - Overall ambient
1433502410|5.0|This is my favorite Study Bible and I have several others.  I would recommend it to everyone.<br />I like the fact that the Notes are just below the text, so no flipping and fumbling. I don't like to turn to another page to get a Note or Explanation.<br />Excellent binding, illustrations and pages.<br /><br />This volume is so nice I hate to make any marks in it, but I jot down notes and underline.<br />Price from Amazon NEW is so reasonable I may buy a 2nd one to read and not mark it up.<br />BEST EVER!!! I am a bible scholar with hundreds of religious books and bibles, so I appreciate a great version/publication when I find one!!!<br />John Lapoint
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|My boy's LOVE cars, so it was only natural to get them Cars 2 on blu ray. The picture is pristine and vibrant. Great quality. The plot to the story is completely different than that of the first movie. More of a \\"mystery\\" and they can't get enough of it. Totally recommend.
B001KN6C9E|5.0|Chang does a fabulous job of offering an analysis which at at once personal for readers, and objective in its treatment of history. She places blame where it ought to be placed: with the individual Japanese soldiers who committed the atrocities rather than with an entire culture.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|There's very little I can say about this book that hasn't already been complained about a dozen times over. However, there were some things that really bothered me more than others.  First off, there's Finnick's demise, written in such a way that I had to go back and reread it a few times to make sure that's really what happened. Very unceremonious, and the reactions were not believable. The fact that Annie seems relatively calm is unsettling, to say the least.  Katniss's mother not visiting her reeks of a woman who has completely abandoned her eldest child, but it didn't happen then, no, it happened years before and Prim was the last thing holding her family together. Frankly, I don't see why she wouldn't try harder to stay by her side at that point, since Katniss takes after her father so much.  Prim's death made little sense. They were thinking of training her to be a doctor. She was essentially already a nurse. She was not military material and yet they toss her in with the medics. I'm sorry, but even field medics have to be up to military standards.  Actually, pretty much the only death that had any thought written into it was Boggs. All the others I couldn't bother to care about because I can't bring myself to believe they're dead when their finales were that poorly written.  And most of all, what irked me most was not the choice for Katniss's partner, but the lack thereof. Gale essentially completely abandons her, which makes little sense if he loved her as much as it hints. I try to justify in my mind that he probably desired her for the reason of not wanting someone to steal his hunt, his game. He noticed her as a love interest when someone else was hitting on her, he only thought about telling her when she was being taken away (And he still failed at that), and he only ever did something about it when she is involved with another guy, whether it was fake or real. No matter what the reasons, he could not have loved her that much if he so readily drops her for a shiny, fancy job in 2. Though I suppose them becoming less close was already pretty obvious from the second book.  I do, however, admit that Peeta's hijacking made things more interesting.  Surprisingly, the actual end did not bother me. Sometimes, a broken person can only ever cling to someone equally broken, as that is the only kind of person who could understand them.  I don't even mind Katniss running off and hiding all the time, I just wish some of the parts were better written. There was so much that I didn't understand because of poor wording.  There were, however, some parts that brought a chuckle or even a laugh. Like Finnick posing in his underwear and the resulting comment from Boggs.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It is fun just like the original. I gave it a five star marking just because I think it could use one.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I was skeptical about getting this one at first, as I had read a few other books rated highly on Amazon and they were simply awful. But I took the risk, not expecting much. I was surprised to find myself absolutely absorbed in the book quickly.  Overall, the book was very suspenseful and I had a really difficult time putting it down. The plot twists were well done. Additionally, the book had several ethical dilemmas which were well done and a nice break from the suspense. I thought the characters were fascinating-with the protagonists drawing cheers and the villains were chilling.  I was delighted to find this book was part 1 in a trilogy, and I look forward to reading the rest!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The trilogy box set must be one of the best ways to to read the entire trilogy, because when you get to the end of one book you don't want to have to wait to get to the next book.  The first two books end with some pretty dramatic cliffhangers.  Start to finish this is one of the most engaging stories I've ever read - that is if you can keep from being distracted by the weak premise of the plot.  Maybe i just think better of people, but I had a hard time wrapping my head around that possibility that civilization can get to a state where one reason uses teens fighting to the death as a form of entertainment or that the sharp contrast between the haves and have nots could persist for as long as it does in the book.

B00000JLWW|1.0|I just received several movies on Titanic. In my opinion, this version  which I saw in the theater, was the poorest of all remakes. The producers  had grealy added romance into the film that it over shadowed the real  facts.  Unfortunately, Amazon does not indulge their Customers to give a \\"nul point\\"  to rate the products. Otherwise, I would have given this movie.

0312641893|5.0|Now I have a confession to make to you all, I'm an absolute sucker for fairy tales. I know, I know, I'm a grown women, I'm supposed to have realised by now that fairy tales never come true, right? I just can't help it though, there is just something about getting lost in a story so far away that from reality that really draws me in. So of course when I heard that Marissa Meyer was writing a retelling of Cinderella with cyborgs I just knew that I had to get my hands on this book.<br /><br />Cinder is one of New Beijing's best mechanics, but much more than that she is also a cyborg. She is viewed as beneath everyone else and detested by her stepmother who blames her for everything that goes wrong. When Cinder encounters the Prince at the market one morning her whole world is thrown upside down and she becomes involved in a intergalatic battle and an inner struggle much larger than she could ever have dreamed.<br /><br />Sometimes, in fact sadly more often that not, fairy tale retellings end up being a disappointment as too much emphasis is placed on the original story and not enough on making the story stand out on its own. Well Cinder by Marissa Meyer, was definatly not a disappointment, in fact it was such an interesting read that I was completely drawn into the story and unable to put this book down. I love that Marissa Meyer created such a unique retelling of Cinderella, which although predicatable, as we already know the story of Cinderella, had its own twists and turns. The creation of New Beijing where Cinder lives is so creatively brought to life that I was instantly swept away in this futuristic world of disease, cyborgs and Lunars.<br /><br />As a heroine, and our very own cyborg Cinderella, I adored Cinder. She is such a strong, smart and totally brave character, who screams independance. She really wants to stand on her own two feet and overcome the obstacles that are placed in front of her. What a role model for any girl reading this novel! All the characters within Cinder stand out in their own right and are multi dimensional with so many different layers, you will constantly be questioning who everyone really is.<br /><br />Overall, Cinder was an enticing, unique, beautifully written story of disease, heartbreak and evil queens. This is Cinderella on a more gritty level, you definatly won't find any glass slippers or fairy godmothers in this retelling. Cinder is the first<br />novel in the Lunar Chronicles series and I cannot wait to read on with the next book to find out what happens next. I would highly recommened this book to everyone, in fact go out and buy it now, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Georgina<br />Chick Litaholicn their own right and are multi dimensional with so many different layers, you will constantly be questioning who everyone really is.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was really attracting, making the readers wonder about the story of the character's grandfather. But I think that the ending was too abrupt, and it does not really tell us how the remaining characters from the orphanage lives. The ending causes me to wonder if there will be a sequel, because if not, I do not really like this ending. Other than the ending, this book is intriguing and fun, the photos matches perfectly with the words. I really like this book as a conclusion, but i hope that there will be a sequel to it.

B0057UA4FY|5.0|This was an excellent purchase! I'm a die-hard Star Wars fan, and this piece of Star Wars canon was a wonderful, well-priced edition to my collection. While it would have been nice to see some of the stars from the films do voice acting, the back story is a welcome expansion to the Star Wars universe.  While I enjoy this because of my fandom, it does not require a serious devotion to Star Wars to be enjoyed. The show is family friendly, maybe PG (I believe I heard the word \\"damn\\" once or twice), but a great purchase. People of all age groups will enjoy the action, the well-rendered animations, and the stories held within this DVD series.  I would reccomend this to all my friends looking for a good TV series, in addition to anyone running a Star Wars RPG campaign set during the Clone Wars era. The additional weapons, stories, characters, and events can certainly help to flesh out a game.

0739358049|4.0|In 1992 Christopher McCandless, a top student of the University of Atlanta, known to be strong-willed, idealistic, and an exceptional athlete, walked away from his family never to be seen by them again.  It was soon to be discovered that Christopher had given away his entire savings of $24,000 to a hunger charity.  Later yet, his beloved car was found abandoned with a note on it basically saying \\"finders... keepers.  It's yours.\\"<br /><br />Four months later he was found dead inside an old bus in the Alaska wilderness.<br /><br />What would cause a young man with such a bright future, a good home, family and friends who loved him, to shut everyone out without a reason why?<br /><br />His diary which was found at a remote camp site tell a tale that is so unbelievable - it has to be true.  Chris (who changed his name to Alex at this time) writes of odd jobs he found along the way to earn enough to get by, the people he met, and continued to connect with, the loss of his car, no food for days, and eventually moving into the Alaskan wilderness believing he would live off the land - catch and kill what he needed to eat to survive.<br /><br />Into the Wild has been a book that has interested me since I first heard about it.  Christopher McCandless was someone I wanted to know more about.  I could imagine the pain of a family not knowing where there son was, and I was curious about a boy just graduated who could walk away from his family and not look back.  Not so much as a note to say \\"I am ok\\".<br /><br />I found Chris' story - as told from what he left in a dairy of his journeys to be one that was both sad and fascinating at the same time.  I was sad for his family and could not imagine what it felt like to not know where there son was... and I was fascinated at the decisions Chris made along the way... for a while it seemed like quite the adventure.<br /><br />Even after listening to this book on audio, I am still left with questions.  Did Chris have a death wish?  He had not packed properly for his journey, not even having a compass.  And no one knew where he was.  No one.  Or was Chris just a boy with an over inflated idea of himself and his knowledge to survive away from people and the comforts of home.  He had several books on identifying edible plants after all....<br /><br />The world will never know... but I like to believe the latter.<br /><br />An audio that astounded me.  I was held to listening to it long after I should have been running my errands, or moving on to another project.  It is a rare audio that stops me to just sit and listen... and that is what I didompass.  And no one knew where he was.  No one.

0312641893|5.0|Cinder is 17 and works in the market of New Beijing as a gifted mechanic.  In this new world Cinder repairs many things among them, androids.  When the handsome and kind Prince Kai's stops by her booth in the market with a request for a repair, and sparks fly.... (in a good way)<br /><br />What Prince Kai does not know that Cinder is not just a pretty girl who is handy with a wrench... she is actually a cyborg from the result of an accident she had as a child, lives with her step mother who treats her like hired help and has two-step sisters one she adores and one.... well... not so much...<br /><br />What Cinder does not know is that her destiny and Prince Kai's are about to collide.<br /><br />Did I mention there is going to be a Ball?<br /><br />When I picked Cinder up a couple of nights ago, my plan was to just get a feel for the book before I went to bed.  But Cinder grabs you from the start and before I knew it I was 176 pages in and having to put the book down.  I finished it the next evening.<br /><br />Cinder is the first  have read like this and I loved how incredibly well done the book is.  Marissa Meyer weaves between this Apocolyptic time and the storyline of the original Cinderella I am amazed at how she does it.  All the key elements are there, the crabby step mother, the prince, the ball, the dress, and even something orange to arrive in but I wont tell you what.... ;)<br /><br />AND.... while all this is going on it does not feel forced but flows nicely and made me want to cheer \\"Go Marissa Meyer Go!!!\\"<br /><br />Cinder is going to be a part of a series and it does leave you at an exciting point of .... \\"WHA???  WAIT!!!\\"\\"  so I warned you....  I even went on-line to see if I could get an idea for the time line for the other books and here is what I found:<br /><br />Cinder is based on Cinderella. Scarlet, the second book in the series, will be based on Little Red Ridinghood. Crest will be based on Rapunzel. And, Winter will be based on Snow White.  Cinder will be the main character in each of these books and you can count me in on this wild Apocolyptic tale ride!!!n on this wild Apocolyptic tale ride!!!
B00386EZJU|4.0|On the whole, I agree that it is one of the best soundtracks in recent years. The Oscar nomination for the music writing was well deserved, if not an actual winning. The music is atmospheric, very much attaining to the respective scenes and visual imageries -- from dramatic to intimate, spooky to triumphant. High standard movie musics as in other John Powell compositions, although there are apparent hints of repeating himself as compared with his musics in \\"Ice Age 2\\". Repeated listening of these two discs really started to confuse me.<br /><br />The quality of the recording is also above average although the recording level seems a bit on the high side, so dial down the volume before playing. It has very wide sound stage and sonic spectrum, well tallying with the effects needed in the movie itself. Listening to the soundtrack gives one an impression of watching the movie. Not that there is any surround effect as compared with playing via movie discs (the audio of that blu-ray is equally good in an A/V perspective), but the broad sonic imaging conveys at times the feeling of riding on Toothless. The bass, however, tends to be a bit too much that it appears to be less \\"musical\\" than the rest of the notes. This is especially obvious when playing the musics in low volume. So once one has got used to the high recording level, provided one has some very tolerant neighbors, playing in higher volume does help balance that out a bit.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are \\"Test Drive\\" and \\"Romantic Flight\\". How I wish John Powell could have singled these out to expand them into full-fledged symphonic poems or incidental musics of some sort.<br /><br />For people who like this movie as I, this is a disc to enjoy.
0800141865|5.0|... to be elected Censor of this New Roman Republic of America, Flynt would get the nod. That would have been true even before I watched this film, not because of any regard I have for Flynt or for Hustler magazine but because of my contempt for Jerry Falwell, for his extremism and bigotry, and for his involvement with Charles Keating. Perhaps I should recuse myself, therefore, from reviewing this film, since I couldn't possibly react impartially to the evidence in the trial of Flynt for libel and the subsequent appeals processes that took Flynt and Falwell to the US Supreme Court.<br /><br />As portrayed by actor Woody Harrelson, porn-publisher Larry Flynt wasn't a guy you'd want for a son-in-law. He was loud, crude, sleazy, narcissistic, sociopathic, greedy, and a bully. Harrelson makes him terrifyingly real; I'm sure if I met the real Flynt, i'd be perplexed and wonder why he didn't look like Woody. There's a lot of very skillful acting in this film, and brilliant directing by Czech-American Milos Forman, whose previous films had included: Loves of a Blonde, The Firemen's Ball, Taking Off, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Hair, and Amadeus. Honestly, I would never have watched \\"The People vs Larry Flynt\\" if it were not for my respect for Milos Forman as a director.<br /><br />But I have to confess that the first fifteen or twenty minutes of this film left me skeptical. Flynt is obnoxious, the sleaze shots are nauseating, the whole scenario seems pointless ... until the \\"good people\\" of Ohio, people including Charles Keating, resolve to make a martyr of Flynt. And then the film becomes increasingly powerful even while Flynt himself becomes increasingly unpalatable. It is a film about civil liberties, about freedom of expression, about the right of any individual to resist the oppressive of any self-proclaimed \\"Moral Majority\\". Actor Edward Norton delivers some ripping good rhetoric in favor of freedom-of-conscience in his portrayal of Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacson, in front of the Supreme Court. Flynt's personal life may be seen as a tragedy with laughable elements -- he does get shot and paralyzed, his wife does become a junkie and an AIDS victim, and he does become mentally unsettled -- but the film is has a triumphant happy ending.preme Court.

B005J7K964|5.0|At the time it was released in the 1980s, Moroder's Metropolis was the most complete version of the film available.  Although purists might look with disdain on this then contemporary soundtrack and use or tinting and subtitles; these additions do nothing more than enhance the film.  The score gives the movie a futuristic feeling, while effectively conveying the mood of each scene.  His use of subtitles, elliminte the jarring use of intertitles, the tinting helps to enhance the emotions of each sequenced.  Modorer did extensive research before adding these things; he found very old copies of Metropolis  with both tinting and subtitles used and copied the original tinting for his restoration of the film.  Although more footage from this classic  has since been found, some people might actually perfer the compactness of this version.  The story is fully understandable and though we don't have every nuiance of each character's moltivation it's easy to understand the themes of social elitism, love at first sight, the battle of virtue and vice, and the hope that true love will conquer all.<br /><br />Although silent film purists may like some of the more recent restorations better, this version provides a great alternative.  I think this movie is especially good for fans of movie science fiction, who want to enjoy the slendors of Lang's vision of a rapidly approaching futre without sitting through a much longer presentation.

0307959856|1.0|In short this book is a fine example of how a great idea can totally fail.  I love Jane Austen and I love mysteries so I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations.  It's characters lacked the charm of Austen's.  It seems that the writer was trying to appeal to Austen fans while at the same time putting in lots of detail from the original book so that new readers would know everything that had already happened.  The result is bordom for both groups.  In addition to all of the problems identified in earlier reviews, there are just stupid mistakes.  For example, when everyone is out during one long night,  the author describes the full moon lighting the scene.  She then describes the rain hitting a character's face as he exits the carriage.  Then she goes back to describing a moonlit glade. And then the rain again. I don't know about the rest of the world but here in New England, if the rain is hitting your face at night, there isn't much for moon light.  And a full moon doesn't stay high up in the sky from early evening to the pre-dawn hours either. It rises and falls much the way the sun does.  The physical inconsistencies described in the book bothered me so much that even if the rest of the book had been well written, which it wasn't, I wouldn't have been able to enjoy it.  Really, whoever edited this book bears as much responsibility for letting it be published like this as the author does.  They wouldn't have let their mother walk out of the house trailing toilet paper without saying something so why would they let this book be published as-is? They need to rethink their career choice.

If you've ever thought or said that, check out these guys. The vocals and melodies will certainly remind you of Led Zep (not surprisingly, given Mr. Bonham's presence), and the keyboards, courtesy of my Armenian cousin Mr. Sherinian, are incredible - think Jan Hammer and Rick Wakeman, but with a rougher edge. Outstanding production that almost sounds like analog days.  This CD isn't perfect, but in 2012, it's a superb homage to the finer days of rock, performed flawlessly by incredible musicians.  I will defintely explore their subsequent CDs - can't imagine they suffered a sophomore jinx.

B005COO1X6|2.0|I'm 45, and grew up reading, living, thinking and absolutely thriving on the works of Stephen King. I've read and re-read all the classics up to and really enjoying Buick 8.  I take no pleasure whatsoever in saying this one was a let-down for me.  In fact, I actually found myself wondering if he had someone else ghost-write it for him, sad to say.  No joke.  Where his<br />characters, dialogue and setting used to draw me in, keep me there and seem so realistic, in this they seem to struggle along, and as the reader, I struggled along with them.  I'd say it's possible I've grown out of SK's<br />material as I've gotten older, but his older works still grab and move me<br />as much as they ever did.  Maybe he's grown out of it(?)  My opinion, of<br />course, and I've read the reviews where people say this is \\"classic\\" King returned, but for me...think I'll go back and pick up The Shining again.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|My best friend has 2 of these he bought locally, and I really like both knives. I do like the 2nd generation better though. If I order this knife from Amazon tomorrow will I be shipped the 1st or 2nd generation knife? I can save 15 dollars if I buy from Amazon, but I would rather pay the extra 15 to be sure I do get the 2nd generation though. I have used my friends 2nd generation knife on a couple of camping trips and it is a very tough knife. It has a very thick blade and feels perfect in my medium size hands. Although i don't yet own this knife I can say without a doubt if you like fixed blade knives that will last a life time then you will not go wrong with either the 1st or second generation. I just like the look of the 2nd generation better.

It's hard to believe that Ms. Hoover is a first-time author--I'm thinking she has a bright future ahead. As I began reading the book, I thought \\"oh no, this is going to be a teenage angsty drama fest\\". I kept reading though, and discovered that her writing style is extremely appealing to adults as well. The characters seemed like they could be people we all know, and she pulled no punches when it came to feelings and situations. I am looking forward to her next book!

Either the whole thing warps up like a bowl when snapped together, or the middle starts popping out.<br /><br />I figure that this might happen occasionally so I requested an exchange from Amazon.  They sent me a new copy and I immediately took out the pieces, put them together... same problem.<br /><br />If you manage to get a board that fits together, this is a really fun game, but clearly this edition has some issues with how they're cutting the pieces and I'm not the first to complain.<br /><br />I'll be returning this copy and waiting for another edition to be released or a local shop trying to get rid of one of their third editions.

Picked up for free on app of the day but would have paid for the app quickly after a trial period. Should offer a trial to test produce even for 24 hrs. 5 min would be enough to decide if you need this.
0312427646|5.0|The Uncommon Reader is a novella by novelist and playwright, Alan Bennett. The story starts with the Queen coming across the mobile library van parked near Buckingham Palace, where Norman, a young man from the kitchens, is choosing a book. After making small talk with the driver/librarian and the kitchen hand, she feels duty-bound to borrow a book. Which she, of course, dutifully reads and returns the following week for another. Soon enough, she has Norman transferred from the kitchens to assist her in her new favourite pastime, reading. This delightful dose of British humour speculates on what happens to the royal duties and the royal household as the Queen gives in to her obsession. Full of laugh-out-loud moments, especially the last line.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|Never thought to review anything before, but this knife deserves it.  Shaving sharp out of the box and a beautiful polish on the blade.  Only light tool marks on the edge grind, otherwise the knife hasn't a blemish on it.  Unlike previous review, the knife is held tightly in the sheath - a little too tight actually.  I'm hoping it will loosen a little with use.  It's got a nice heft and balances right at the finger guard.
0060786523|5.0|A Suitable Boy is the second novel by Vikram Seth. It is the story of Lata Mehra and her mother Mrs Rupa Mehra (Ma to her friends), who is intent on finding for her daughter \\"a suitable boy\\". It is essentially a story of love and family, but set in the background of immediate post-partition India, the early `50s, and portrays vividly the tensions between races, classes, castes and religions at a time when the newly independent country was struggling to deal with the challenges of famine, mass poverty and uncertainty about its future.  Among the many prospects for Lata are: the love match, the (Muslim) Kabir, son of a mathematics professor, whom Ma is decidedly against; the indolent poet Amit, with whom Ma is also unhappy; and the English-educated shoe businessman, Haresh, who seems ideal to Ma, although Lata is less than convinced.  When the reader first picks up this brick (it's almost 1500 pages and Seth even jokes in his Word of Thanks that it may cause wrist injury!), it may seem a daunting prospect, but the writing style makes it surprisingly easy to read. There are a lot of characters, but the family trees kindly provided at the beginning help to keep track of them. This book has humour, horror and heartache; there is tragedy and triumph, passion and politics, violence and victims, grief and guilt; Seth's depiction of the Indian way of life at this time in her history is interesting and informative. This novel has an imaginative plot, and a range of fascinating characters: the emotional Ma; the arrogant Arun; the matter-of-fact Haresh; the precocious Aparna; the intelligent Bhaskar; the absent-minded Dr Durrani; the insouciant Chatterjis with their flippant couplets. Seth is a gifted poet and another delightful touch is that the Word of Thanks is in verse and the Chapter (Part) Headings are rhyming couplets. This novel had me laughing out loud many times, but moved me to tears more than once, as well. It may have taken me almost 2 weeks to read it, but I lovedit, and I look forward to the imminent (2013?) \\"A Suitable Girl\\".

These guys on this record made what should stand as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, American Heavy Metal record of the 1980's.  It was what Judas Priest should've been doing if they didn't get caught up in trying to be commercial, and I would even say it went on to influence what they did on the Painkiller album.

B005OK721G|1.0|At first I was going to give it two stars, but after thinking about it some more, I just couldn't bring myself to do it and downgraded it even more.  As someone else wrote in another review - to the director whether something makes sense is completely irrelevant and unimportant in a movie.<br /><br />First of all, I am Colombian and I have been in Colombia many times.  Sure there are ghettos like that, just like there are some here in the US so let me say one thing and maybe you can see where my view was \\"corrected\\".  The early scenes are filled with gun battles in these bad neighborhoods.  No cops show up and people just run through the city shooting and chasing with everyone just looking on or barely paying attention before going back to their TVs.  At first I though - hey, they are really doing a hatchet job on Colombia.  Even in the ghetto - you start a gun battle and the authorities will show up and NOT the police but the Army instead.  They don't have laws against the Army being involved in civil matters like we do here.  And the army is very well armed and trained for such events.  So like I said, at first I thought that this guy knows NOTHING about Colombia and he is just ignorant (which he is) but then soon after we end up in Chicago.<br /><br />Well, another scene occurs there and then I get it.  This director is just a total imbecil.  Another scene with shots ringing out, the police in this case DO show up but of course this guy and the little girl just walk away without any of the 50 onlookers pointing at them for the police to do anything.  The movie was just filled with garbage like that.  Yeah sure, in a US jail you can get around from room to room through the ventilation system.  Just open a vent in a cell and get almost anywhere you want to go.  Sure, enter a cell and have hair pins and stuff like that to pick a lock, because when you get arrested they don't take EVERYTHING away from you - minus your clothes because picking a lock with a hairpin is something the police have NEVER thought about themselves.<br /><br />Firing a high powered rifle from a building without being found out.  An Uzi 9mm that fires bullets as if they were from a 50 cal machinegun.  It just goes on and on.  What is the point about talking how stealthy she is when.... well, remember the Monty Python movies where the knight is seen in the distance and he keeps running towards the two guards - when finally he comes out of NOWHERE to kill them both.  It is JUST like that.  Sure, it is funny in a comedy - but this is not meant to be a comedy.  Yet when you use that type of stealthy maneuvering or camera cutaway scenes, it is just plain stupid.  If you are going to talk English then please don't do it with a stupid accent.  Either speak Spanish in the native tongue or speak English fluently please rather to than giving them some kind of stupid accent to make you think they are speaking Spanish.<br /><br />RPGs don't create fire like that either - that is not what they are designed for.  Why did she enter the shark tank in the first place? She got everywhere else she wanted to go by walking alongside walls, through vents, and sewer lines - how did she get into the pool in the first place?  Oh - for a cool effect! Being illogical isn't cool, it just takes you out of the fantasy of the movie.  Someone else mentioned in another review that women don't do all of that - shoot so many people without herself getting shot to pieces.  Well, to be fair NO man does that either without becoming Swiss cheese.  I am willing to give an action movie certain leeway (just like I would give any movie) when it comes to suspeding logic - but this goes WAY too far.something the police have NEVER thought about themselves.<br /><br />Firing a high powered rifle from a building without being found out.

B0067QPVD2|2.0|..to see a \\"mostly\\" prequel to Carpenter's '82 version of The Thing, then you might want to see this.  But if you really like the '82 version, don't bother.  This film is pretty much just back story to the '82 movie, and it's got a lot of flaws in it that simply don't align well with the '82 version.  It's literally like the writers and director decided that they wanted to show exactly how some things seen in the '82 movie occured...and some other things that were seen, they said, \\"forget that, I gotta cooler idea!\\"  For example, the bloody axe at the Norwegian camp, they show exactly how that got there; The use of thermite to uncover the alien ship?  Nope, the ships' own engines, turned upward, to melt the ice.  It's a real WTF? moment.  It's not a bad movie, just kinda boring.  Some scenes are actually quite good.  And others made me think to myself, \\"now that's just stupid\\".  It would have been better if they HAD made a remake.  Or a sequel.  That way, they could have done what they wanted to in the movie, and it wouldn't have mattered.  So this is definitely a rental, or, at best, a bargain bin buy.

B004UXUX4Q|2.0|The best rating I can give this movie is a Good God.  If the theme music hadn't been so inappropriately jaunty, if the themes hadn't been so schizophrenic, if the characters had been more believable and sympathetic, if the plot had been coherent, if the film as a whole had a notion of where it was going, if the alky/druggy teenaged daughter hadn't made such a dizzying leap into mental health, if George Clooney's eyeliner had been more subtly applied -- then this might have turned out to be a halfway creditable effort. But noooooo.  As it was, this movie resembled a bunch of trailers jammed together under a common title, all starring the same basic troupe of actors who had read the script months before and promptly forgotten the plot. The director/producer/scriptwriter had conflicting ideas of what they wanted. Not one of the lot seemed to really understand the grinding sadness of the situation. It warranted a treatment much like that given IRONWEED but got anything but.

0307887898|5.0|I selected this observation by Drucker (1963) because it continues to suggest caution when deciding what to do, how and when to do it, etc. Michael Porter also offers a helpful reminder: \\"The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.\\" This is especially true of those who are either planning to launch a start-up or have only recently done so. Given the number of Four and Five Star reviews of this book featured by Amazon as of this moment (136 of a total of 153), Eric Ries has clearly attracted and rewarded the attention of those who share his determination to \\"improve the success rate of new innovative products worldwide.\\" He offers a method by which to achieve that objective, based on five separate but interdependent principles best revealed within the book's narrative, in context.<br /><br />Ries suggests two primary reasons for the failure of most startups. One is trusting indicators of likely success that are either inappropriate or unreliable such as a good business plan, a solid strategy, and thorough market research. A startup is by nature and unknown quantity, Ries points out, as are its prospects. Also, many entrepreneurs and their investors become impatient, then frustrated, and abandon traditional management practices.  I agree with him that all startups must be managed and only those that are managed well have a chance to survive. It is also important to keep in mind that, at one time, each of the \\"Fortune 500\\" was a startup, launched by one or more entrepreneurs who would not be denied.<br /><br />Credit Ries with pursuing what Jim Collins and Jerry Porras characterize in Built to Last as a Big Hairy Audacious Goal or BHAG:  To provide \\"a new discipline for entrepreneurial management\\" that takes into full account \\"the chaos and uncertainty that startups must face...I believe that entrepreneurship requires a managerial discipline to harness the entrepreneurial opportunity we have been given.\\" Here's the BHAG: \\"change the entire ecosystem of entrepreneurship.\\"<br /><br />The Lean Startup movement's size and impact seem to be rapidly increasing as entrepreneurs worldwide embrace the tenets of a manufacturing revolution that Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo are credited with developing at Toyota. These tenets by no means preclude traditional functions such as vision and concept, product development, marketing and sales, etc. Rather, what Ries advocates (if I understand him correctly) is a new way of looking at the development of innovative new products by accepting a new way of looking at the management process by which that will be accomplished.<br /><br />As I re-read this book, I realized that despite all the attention that Ries devotes to startups, much (if not most) of the material in his book is directly relevant to almost all organizations, whatever their size, nature, and birth date may be. This is what Jack Welch had in mind when explaining his reasons for admiring small companies. Here is a brief excerpt from his remarks at a GE annual meeting about 20 years ago:<br /><br />\\"For one, they communicate better. Without the din and prattle of bureaucracy, people listen as well as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other. Second, small companies move faster. They know the penalties for hesitation in the marketplace. Third, in small companies, with fewer layers and less camouflage, the leaders show up very clearly on the screen. Their performance and its impact are clear to everyone. And, finally, smaller companies waste less. They spend less time in endless reviews and approvals and politics and paper drills. They have fewer people; therefore they can only do the important things. Their people are free to direct their energy and attention toward the marketplace rather than fighting bureaucracy.\\"<br /><br />As Eric Ries concludes his book, he wonders what an organization would look like \\"if all of its employees were armed with Lean Startup superpowers.\\" What indeed.Startup movement's size and impact seem to be rapidly increasing as entrepreneurs worldwide embrace the tenets of a manufacturing revolution that Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo are credited with developing at Toyota.

0307387178|4.0|I had to read this book for my AP English class. I found it to be a very interesting account of a very tragic story. Towards the end it did seem a little repetitive, but other than that Krakauer does a very good job of retelling the sad story of Chris McCandless. He also has a variety of different sources for the telling of the story so the reader can get the full experience that McCandless did.
030788743X|5.0|As I am writing this, I have now read the book once, and listened to the Audiobook twice.  I can without a doubt say this is now one of my favorite books.  The book itself was a joy to read, even if I didn't always get some of the references.  It made me laugh out loud, and maybe even cry a little.  A must read for any true video game or movie geek.  As for the audiobook, Wil Wheaton brings this book to life amazingly well.  I can bet he loved doing it.  I spend nearly three hours a day in a car, and started listening to audiobooks to help ease the drive.  This is the first one, that I had to keep listening too when I got out of the car.  It was just that good.
B005DI994W|2.0|First let me say that as a former military man, I am a great fan of this movie. I am also aware that when writing a review of anything here, there are too many ad hominem attacks, and not rebuttals of the review, which make me reluctant to comment on anything. Having said that, I must admit that I am very disappointed with this Criterion issue of the Four Feathers.  I have always thought of Criterion DVDs as the best, and I thought that the blu-ray edition would be absolutely spot-on, however, that is not the case with this one.  I own an MGM edition of the film, and found it to be overall superior to that of Criterion's.  I do not know if I am just unlucky and have received a bad copy of the film, but I am going to send it back to Amazon and stay with my MGM copy.  Issues to mention:  The Criterion edition, although sharper, has a very spotty color transfer, overly bright in some places, and with some discoloration in others.  There are no subtitles in the Criterion DVD, but the MGM version has them, in several languages.  I noticed that in several parts of the film the color fades in and out, and the backgrounds appear washed up, as if the film had been colorized.  As I mentioned, please do not attack me personally for this review.  If your copy of this film is better than the one have I written about, then good for you.  I will still return the DVD to Amazon and leave it at that.  This is only one man's opinion.
B001DPHDCY|1.0|When I purchased this movie I was so excited to watch it with my 2 year old. When I received it, my 2 year old was super excited to watch it.

It is only to put on your computer or something. This is not what I paid for!! I am soo angry about this. Now I have to send it back and buy it somewhere else. I am so tired of buying movies from Amazon. 9 out of 10 times they are messed up, broken or ruined!
B001TODO54|5.0|It is truly rare to find a flawless book, however Graceling by Kristin Cashore may be the closest to such perfection that I have come across in a very long while.  Written in a sword and sorcery style without delving into the all-too-common absurd, this book completely achieved a suspension of disbelief that allowed me to live in their world while learning to love the character I met.<br />We begin this journey on a dark night in a dungeon while our hero is breaking out a prisoner and taking down scores of guards without breaking a sweat, or any of their necks.  This pace and energy it fairly constant though this work, ebbing and flowing as the narrative allows, but the backbone of a living tale.  Katsa is hero Graced with the ability to fight a legion and burdened with the guilt of having doled out her uncle, The King's, punishment.  To balance the scales a bit she creates her own council of peers to save the persecuted, and not just punish them. It is with this premise born into our minds though the first few scenes of this work, that we enter into the recue which weaves through our tail; that of a grandfather of the Lienid nation, father to a foreign king, rescued out of the dungeon of one of the seven kingdoms, with no clear idea why he was abducted.  It is in such inauspicious surroundings, running to beat the guards return to consciousness that we meet our second hero; and where the first cracks to Katsa's belief of herself as a monster form.  It is here that we meet Po; right before Katsa knocks him unconscious.<br />The rich tapestry that the author manages to weaves with such seeming effortlessness it truly humbling.  Throughout this work there were several places where I feared it would devolve into inanity...become all about court intrigue, or implausible romance, or some other oft-trodden path.  I am happy to report it did none of those, and while I am sure some could argue it is in its essence a hero tale and in such has been told; I would happily argue back that a hero tale it may be, but I have never read one like this before.<br />This is a book for which I will be seeking out the companion novel, Fire, without delay and eagerly await whatever tales such a gifted author chooses to cast my way in such a living world.at a hero tale it may be, but I have never read one like this before.

B004JN1D2I|3.0|I bought this Kindle edition of the first four volumes as a set and read to the end of volume three, A Storm of Swords. I consider the story a five star read, but when I started the fourth, A Feast For Crows, I found myself reading words that I had read before, with characters that I had seen die in events that I had witnessed. I am sure that if I buy the separate version of volume four I would be able to read the story in proper sequence, but I am unwilling to buy the same book twice. I would borrow my brother's printed copy or request it from our public library, but with a paralyzed hand and arm it would be very difficult to hold and turn the pages. I may give up and start on book five, hoping to guess at what I had missed, but that would be very unsatisfying.

B0061US58C|3.0|as most of the reviewers, I was disappointed.  We all loved the first Cars movie and couldn't wait to watch this one.  This one has a lot more action and a lot less heart.  I watched it twice with my 3 and 5 year olds because my three year old fell asleep the first time.  The second time around, he completely tuned out about half way through and went and played with his cars.  I guess my 5 year old liked it enough, but not nearly as well as she liked the first one.  It's worth the rental cost I guess.
1592802974|5.0|This is the 6th book I've read on my way to becoming a great trader. This book is long and took me some time to get it read. I highly recommend this book for any trader just starting out. Most of the traders in the book are commodities traders but they all have a common theme of cutting losses early except for one. There was one trader who said not to cut losses right away once you are hit with a big price shock, it's best to wait until the volatility calms down. For example if you are down 10% it's best to waited it out and take a 8% loss. This of course takes a strong stomach and great discipline.<br /><br />Other notable lessons learned from the book is one trader said if he does not make a profit right away from a trade then it was a bad trade. I find this very interested because a lot if my trades start off in the red and they seem to work for me. Another trader said that he sells half of his position if down for a week and sell the other half if still down the following week. The book depicts a lot of strategies but mostly talks about how they all got started.<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />Dmonk

0062060554|1.0|I discovered this novel on a \\"Best novels of 2011\\" list and am astonished to discover the enthusiasm and hyperbole in the majority of reviews. This novel is quite simply one of the worst novels I have  read in 2011. The plot is ridiculously implausible, and it relies on coincidence and the isolation of the amnesiac Christine. Christine's amnesia is inconsistent and she conveniently recovers fragments when the story needs to move on. Unfortunately the story doesn't move on with any of the momentum a thriller needs to keep the reader in suspense. The writing is plodding and banal, and the resolution is ridiculous and saccharine. While the author acknowledges that he used the famous amnesiac and former musicologist Clive Wearing's life for inspiration, I found it distasteful at how closely he reproduced the tragic attempts Clive Wearing made in his journal to make sense of his life. His protagonist Christine also records the relentless \\"waking up for the first time\\" comments in a diary.  Painful, slow and far-fetched.
B00005T7I1|1.0|A boldly literal interpretation of what was, at the time, sixty-year-old source material, Dick Tracy was dated before it had even commenced filming. In today's world, it's a painful reminder of what happens when badly misread cultural trends, aging showbiz producers and a full committee of writers collide on-screen. Visually it's a day-glow disaster, combining recklessly outlandish wardrobe, distractingly obvious matte-painting backdrops, startlingly grotesque makeup effects and an odd mix of kids' primary colors with ink-black noir lighting. The cast is so stale, weak and one-dimensional throughout that not even an A-list staff of Hollywood's elite is able to play life preserver: Dustin Hoffman, James Caan and Al Pacino are lost amidst the flood of stilted dialog, Madonna sleepwalks through a rotten performance as, basically, herself, and Warren Beatty is so squeaky clean and unrelentingly straightforward in the leading role that it almost works on a purely satirical level. Clearly someone, somewhere, saw the runaway success of Tim Burton's Batman around the corner and chose to grant a similar treatment to a character they recalled from the funny pages of their own youth, without stopping to consider if Tracy's story was as relevant and trans-generational as Bruce Wayne's. The splashy colors and simple, hackneyed plot make it a no-sell to adults, while the abundance of sex and violence also makes it tough to buy as a kid's movie. Genuinely awful from start to finish, I had to watch in three installments because it kept putting me to sleep.

B00122OCQI|5.0|What a great album.  I had this tape back in Jr. High.  Yes I said tape, believe it or not there was a time when there was no CD' or MP3s.  I use to listen to the entire album over and over.  I just purchased the MP3 album and will do the same thing.  If your a depeche mode fan or like the \\"new wave\\" era music, check it out.
B0055SWM08|5.0|just enough difficulty to keep me engaged. not so hard though that I lose interest. well worth every cent in my book
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a very fun game but they should have all the games unlocked. it is annoying that you have to use coins to.unlock games.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|If it would actually work in my church this would be a great app.  Too many times it will not connect with the server. I cannot take notes or even read the Bible during the sermon.  Hope they can fix this.bug.

0525478817|5.0|I, sadly, am not as articulate as the masterful John Green, but I will try to describe how wonderful this book is. I think the best way to describe how this book made me feel is to use what John Green said when he answered a question about how this book was supposed to make you feel: You feel all the things. I found myself, multiple times, literally laughing and sobbing at the same time. This is one of those books, you know? That you know will be a big part of you for a very long time. And I do sincerely feel that everyone would be bettered if they were to read this book.

B006MQRLSA|4.0|Moneyball, a smart and entertaining drama directed by Bennett Miller, would appear at first glance to be a traditional underdog sports film in which a ragtag group of players come together as a team and against all odds become champions.  Except that's not what this movie is about.  Not remotely.  Moneyball is instead a fact based and ultimately honest depiction of the business of Major League Baseball, a sport where teams with deep pockets and endless resources are able to buy their way to championships while small market teams must struggle and scrap to compete.<br /><br />The plot of Moneyball deals with Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), the general manager of the small market Oakland Athletics.  Following a successful 2001 season in which the A's lose in the playoffs to the big market New York Yankes, Beane faces the seemingly impossible task of rebuilding the team after the loss of star players Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen to richer teams.  Without the payroll he needs to replace these players, Beane embraces a radical approach to assessing talent that is promoted by his new assistant general manager, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill).  Brand, an economics graduate from Yale University, suggests that Beane should focus on buying \\"runs\\" instead of specific players.  Using a system based on statistical analysis of players tendency to get on base, Beane and Brand fill the gaps in the A's lineup with undervalued players who they believe will help the team produce more runs resulting in more wins.  Not surprisingly, the two men meet with fierce criticism and opposition from eveyone from the A's player scouts to the team's manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Things only get worse when the team gets off to a horrific start.<br /><br />Yet as the season wears on, the system starts to work and the team eventaully goes on a 20 game winning streak and returns to the playoffs.  As I stated earlier however, this is not an underdog sports movie.  Beane's method does help the A's compete with the richer teams in baseball and changes the way that teams evaluate talent, but ultimately the same problem remains.  The wealthiest teams will always have an advantage over the small market teams.  Moneyball never resorts to preachiness to make this point thanks to an excellent screenpaly by Steven Zallian and Aaron Sorkin.  The performances are strong as well.  Brad Pitt, no longer able to rely solely on his good looks and charisma, does some of his best acting yet and Jonah Hill gives a nicely understated turn as the much maligned assistant general manager.  In the end the Oakland Athletics don't slay Goliath and become the stuff of baseball lore, but they help to change the way the game is evaluated and keep hope alive for underdogs everywhere to compete with the big boys.  And maybe, just every once in a while, to beat them too.pete with the richer teams in baseball and changes the way that teams evaluate talent, but ultimately the same problem remains.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's okay,something to pass time when bored but not legitimately  fun.  for what it is it deserves three stars. I still play it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read the series and am having withdrawls.  Oh how I wish there were more books in the series, but I have to wait for the movie.  I hope it stands up to the first book.  I loved these characters like they were my children.  I know they were written for Young Adults, but they are just so entertaining, I couldn't put them down.  I have recommended them to all my friends and family.
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|\\"Anomaly Warzone Earth\\" is the type of game that when you read about it you think that there's no way it's going to be fun...no way it's going to even really work.<br /><br />But once you play the first couple of missions, all of your doubts are erased and you're enjoying a great genre from a completely different perspective.<br /><br />\\"Anomaly\\" takes the tower defense formula and completely reverses it.  Instead of placing towers and other defense elements to eliminate an enemy from creeping into an area, you are instead creating units and choosing directions to help your units creep into an area around the AI's towers.  Basically, instead of defending with towers, you're attacking with the moving units.<br /><br />What helps the game succeed so well are all of the amazing qualities of it.  The presentation is top notch, the sounds are on point, and the graphics are great.  But what really steals the show here are the controls.  They just work so well, and your abilities to change strategies on the fly are awesome.  Need to add some new units??  Just bring up the \\"Buy\\" screen and buy what you need, and they get drop shipped in directly behind your current convoy.  Need to upgrade one of your crawlers so it's got more firepower??  Hit \\"Buy\\" again and do what you've got to do.  Realize at the last second that you probably made a poor choice in your direction planning??  Hit the \\"Plot Course\\" button and change your course on the fly.<br /><br />The controls work flawlessly and make the game a pleasure to play.  The graphics, audio, and story that go with the controls are just icing on a delicious cake.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001CC7PPI|3.0|I purchased this DVD in 2009. Just a short bit ago I purchased the 2005 [[ASIN:B000A1INJE Alfred Hitchcock - The Masterpiece Collection]], which includes the DVD of \\"Rear Window\\" (along with all of his other greats!). Tonight I wanted to watch \\"Rear Window,\\" so I started watching my Legacy Collection DVD and noticed that it looked \\"fuzzy\\" to me on my HDTV (a Sony Bravia). I decided to compare it to the \\"Rear Window\\" DVD from the 2005 Masterpiece Collection, and discovered the image from the latter was remarkably superior! It's difficult for me to believe the newer DVD (copyright 2008) is lower quality, but it most certainly is. If you are a Hitchcock fan, even if you already own several Hitchcock DVDs, I highly recommend the 2005 Masterpiece Collection over the individual Legacy Series DVDs. The quality of the Masterpiece Collection DVDs is amazing, the list of extras is impressive, and the price - particularly per DVD - is very good.  The movie, of course, is wonderful!
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|I'd been meaning to read this series for a very long time. I heard about it years ago but was initially worried about how I'd like the sequels. Would I fall in love with the other brothers? Would I enjoy their stories just as much? I now know that I had nothing to worry about! If you still haven't read the books, grab them now and stop putting it off! I fell in love with the main characters immediately and being a long-time fan of gang/mafia novels, I was very pleased with how Perfect Chemistry was so well-balanced between the actual plot and sexy romance! Who knew that the meeting of Alex and Brittany would set off such events?!  Although Brittany Ellis is a white girl who's beautiful, rich, privileged and, of course, very popular, never would she have imagined falling in love with the dangerous Alex Fuentes, who's connected to the Latino Blood gang. If you're worried about some star-crossed insta-love, think again! The two despise each other greatly and it takes a lot of effort for them not to stab each other when they're in the same room. Just like everyone else, Brittany's afraid of him and Alex can't stop hating the perfect snob who thinks she's better than everyone. With each scene, not only does the romance slowly grow stronger but we learn more about the two as individuals. Brittany isn't the mean girl everyone thinks she is and Alex isn't involved with his gang because he likes it. I loved the entire journey Elkeles put me on with these characters and I'm sure you will too!  Alex Fuentes is hot. He knows it...and he uses it to his advantage. Don't pass out when he's whispering in Brittany's ear or propositioning her for a less-than-inappropriate ride in his car. I'm warning you! The two strong personalities collide yet mould together perfectly and this couple is passionate at an A-grade level. While their relationship does go through some complications with predictable outcomes, you'll still be able to really enjoy the story.  Throughout Perfect Chemistry is the conflict Alex has between Brittany and the LB gang. They simply can't co-exist. No matter how much Alex wants to leave his gang, it's impossible, and the novel is filled with shocking revelations, twists, fights and more! It's so much more than just a romance and I think this book was a great start to the series. While Alex will always be my favourite Fuentes, his younger brothers, Carlos and Luis, are certainly very likeable too! Perfect Chemistry has a wonderful ending and paves the way for the sequels very well. If you're up for some heart-racing romance and action, this book's for you! ;)
B005MMYHFK|3.0|Characters are not true to the time. Arthur has no gravitas, Guinevere acts too \\"modern\\". The times are depicted in unrealistic manner. Yes I know this is mostly legend, but at least give us a more real backdrop. Otherwise, OK.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well it takes to.long to her the point u need to get a new game. so what I would do is make the games less and maybe a little bit easier.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|If you're an A7X fan, this is a great purchase. The cd itself is ok. The songs are catchy and different, but nothing spectacular. However, the dvd is spectacular. The band puts on a great performance while including personal elements which make it extremely entertaining. It's as much fun to watch the guys' chemistry as it is to listen to their music.
032147404X|3.0|This book was a decent photography 101 book for Digital SLRs.  However, if you don't have a tripod or aren't shooting with a tripod most of the advice is not relavent.  Still, you do get some good ideas for framing your shot.  We just returned from a trip to Hawaii and I read most of the sections I was interested in on the plane ride there.  I had his advice (that I could use without a tripod) in my head throughout the trip, and I think it enabled me to shoot less frequently and get better results when I did actually take a shot.  The book is organized by the type of pictures you want to take (Landscape, portraits, weddings,etc). This is helpful, because you don't have to bog yourself down with unnecessary information.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is wonderful and works just great. I use this app on a daily basis and it hasn't. failed me yet.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really looked over the selections, over a couple of days. Spent a lot of time. Finally I just ordered this one (the first one I looked at). If you want a protective cover that doesn't add any weight or bulk you should love this one. It is just as advertised in the video, tuff but supple, and fits perfectly. It came in two days with my trial Prime acct. Couldn't be happier with it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|lots of game although some repeat themselves with variations. the more games you play the more expensive the games are and sometimes its hard to collect enough coins to.purchase a game.

0385738765|5.0|After reading through the first book in The Maze Runner Trilogy by James Dashner, my instincts and book club gal pals were right.  I feel he hit his literary groove by the end of book one and keeps it going all the way through book two.  It was action-packed and kept me turning the page.  I felt the anxiety of the scenes being set and creeped out in all the appropriate places.  You really feel you are in the same boat as all of the main characters: totally confused about what is going on and ready to stand up and pound your fist on the table while demanding answers from someone, but you'er not sure who!  All of the dream-like/flashback sequences keep you feeling as though you have some answers without giving away too much.  The only problem is...I still don't have any answers.  I have just begun book three, The Death Cure and there are a slew of ends to tie up.  I like my stories wrapped up like a pretty package in the end, so I hope Dashner can put a bow on this series for me.  Normally I demand happy endings, but that is not what I am saying here.  This story isn't about feeling better, it's more about gaining closure for these kids-even if they are fictional.

B004GXKBFQ|5.0|As a 1st time buyer from Amazon, I tried this one out of the many films since I miss this film since it's not being rerun in movie channels anymore, so I gave this one a shot. Yes, there's no bonuses at all (due to this being a basic Blu-Ray, but it supports BD Live and I say- for a Blu-Ray beginner- that function was a good start, and I read somewhere that select Blu-Rays with this function can update via the 'net so you get new trailers from the company that did this.), but if you only care about watching the movie and not looking for bonus content, you'll be at home with this. Sound and Picture quality are great. The price is so affordable. Not to mention I'm happy I got to see this again. Thanks Amazon! *gives a Kamen Rider Kuuga thumbs-up*
B0059XTUVI|1.0|This was the worst lost opportunity.  So much of the movie was spent in her present day dementia talking to her late husband Dennis.  The Cold War was not even covered except a shot of her dancing with Reagan! We get it - the artistic license to illustrate how we can miss a truly great person in a store and only see an old woman.  Got it.  Could have illustrated that in 4 mins.  Instead it became the most boring time spent with a woman we don't know in her apartment.  The point of a movie is to TELL A STORY.  Not ramble about in present day - we can do that at the mall.  And this is one of the most exciting stories of recent times!  This woman lead a REMARKABLE life.  Yet, you could not find ONE event in the Cold War to cover?  You could not spend more time in her years in Parliament?  It was so boring.  Last year's King's Speech illustrates all that this movie is not - do not stray from the story.  Just chronologically move through the storyline.  The story is already powerful - let it speak for itself.  It is Oscar material and they missed the mark.  And Meryl Streep was AMAZING.  But she could not save the boring travesty that this script reveals.  The screenwriters on this film should never work in this industry again.  One of the WORST.  I wish I could get my ticket price and 2 hours back.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I do a ton of research before i buy anything and one thing i have learned over the years is that you may sometimes be able to get away with a cheaper version but you almost always get what you pay for.<br /><br />This case is still affordable but by far the best one out there.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Thin, it barely adds any bulk or size to the tablet.<br />Weight: It barely adds any weight to the tablet<br />Design: It conforms perfectly to the tablet<br /><br />Cons:<br />None
B0015DROBO|1.0|I am an avid reader, and there is only one book in my life that I did not finish. This book was almost number two. The only reason I continued to read it was because I kept thinking it would get better and I could find out what all the hype was about. Well, there goes several hours of my life that I can't get back. Unfortunately, I made the supreme mistake of downloading all 3 books at once. I won't waste time forcing myself to read the other two. A waste of money, but I won't make that mistake again. Don't waste your money or your time. Paint a wall and watch it dry. You will be much more entertained.

B002HFJ77S|5.0|I first got hooked on Sophie when I read the Shopaholic series. After I read all of those I went on and bought whatever else I could of hers. It took me a while to read this book. Mainly because my sister bought it first and told me I would cry. I have a bad habit of avoiding anything someone tells me will make me cry. I am SO happy I finally purchased it. i got zero sleep, but it was very much worth it. This book is full of self-discovery, humor, life, and everything else. I was able to relate to, and connect to, the characters. I highly recommend this book! I do admit I was able to predict a few things, but I think it's only because I read so much, it takes a lot to stump me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great time killer. controls are a bit shaky on some and a lot of reskinend games. d b f r
B0034JGBM0|5.0|One the best bands of our time, comes this classic DVD, not only a tour doct. but a day in the life of the thinking process of the great song writers of our time,  truly underated, group over all.  Most people try to copy the sound now.  But don't come close. Kind of like Neil Young, and Janis Joplin, and the fem version of Tommy Lee, drum style. Anyway, great drink songs, for any time of the years.

0446402389|5.0|I can't remember when I've found it so hard to put a book down. Seriously, I couldn't be bothered to eat in the 24 hours since I started it, afraid something else surprising would happen without me.  At first I thought it was a translation from the Russian because, as one reviewer pointed out, it does have some jarring grammar. Usually, such awkwardness is enough to put me off, but I was soon so engrossed in the plot that it didn't bother me, and in terms of dialogue, the unadorned prose works very well. The author's experience as a screenwriter shows.  If any book screams for a movie version, it's this one. Oppressive atmosphere, relentless suspense, compelling action, yet it's the interior struggle of the main character that makes for the most interesting journey - what happens when the 'unexamined life' gets ruthlessly examined. What qualities in a person can sustain one belief system and just as logically its antithesis? We discover that unimaginable hardships cripple their victims in highly individual ways. Terrific read, terrific way to lose weight.

B005Y4241K|5.0|5 words:    A MASTERPIECE OF BEAUTIFUL PERFECTION!    -----    I do have to agree that -in my humble opinion- the video editing was, for lack of a better word, crappy at times.  This was most obvious with the faster songs (which unfortunately included my favorite \\"Set Fire To The Rain\\") ---> [...]    What I want to see is Adele's every expression and feeling as she sings her songs.  A shot of the audience or the orchestra/backup singers here and there is perfectly fine... Instead, I got dizzy and headachy watching the screen pan from shot to shot (most not even of her!) with every note.  Did NOT like that at all.    But, IMHO, this DVD still deserves 5 stars because... come on, it's Adele!  A true real and amazing talent in a world of fake pop \\"talent\\".  It is a joy to watch her and listen to her when she talks (potty mouth and all!), sings, laughs... and cries.
0061537969|5.0|Read the kindle version of this book on my iPad -- liked the story so much, I went back to Amazon and ordered 2 hard copy books, one for me and one for a friend to enjoy. Story was a tad slow for the first few pages, but it quickly grabbed my interest and I stayed up till the wee hours in the morning just to finish reading the book.  The story revolves around a young couple who are in love but have some challenges arise -- and the best part, it is all narrated by their dog, Enzo!  There are great twists to the plot.  This is well written, with great flow and ease.  The characters were well developed and I fell in love with little Enzo.

Peeta, and of course, Katniss. i couldnt believe how ALIVE these characters became, and how attached i got to them. i couldnt believe it when one of the characters lost their life, because i had become so attached to her by the end. it had the perfect ending. i loved it so much, and i would read it over, and over and over again.  Katniss Everdeen. The Girl on Fire.

I will keep a close eye on future sales as I would most definitely buy another Invicta in this style or something like it.  Great job!!

I expected it to go faster, but I was tired and had to do things, like sleep.<br /><br />I picked up this book on the recommendation of other members of the Paranormal Romance & Urban Fantasy Fanatics Group. I know, I know. There is nothing Paranormal or Fantasy about this series, but their enthusiasm drew me in. Had I known ahead of time, this book was classified as Erotica with BDSM, I would NOT have read any of them. I am glad I did not know. It would have been a grave mistake to not have read these books.<br /><br />This series is one of my top favorite all time series. The emotions and angst, the damaged Fifty, the strength of someone so young as Ana to take hold and prove her love for him was truly unconditional, it was a roller coaster (run on sentence, but can't help it!!!)<br /><br />My only regret is that it is over. I'm not much for re-reading books, I get bored, but I may even consider re-reading this series... eventually.<br /><br />Thank you E.L. James for sharing your talent!
B0053KWDES|4.0|Overall an excellent portable amp. I have been using it for a while now with a combination of a Sennheiser 555HD and Klipsch S4i headphones.  Soundstage is drastically improved with this device and the overall listening experience is vastly improved with the amps assistance.  The battery life though leaves much to be desired in that it only lasts a few hours and you cannot use it while charging.  Other than that I would recommend it if you want to improve the listening experience on your MP3 player, tablet, and/or phone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is such a great app. It works so well on kindle fire. The games are a great thing to kill time with. It is most definitely my new favorote app. The games are not only fun but creative, and at times the right amount of challenging. At least for me :)
B00288KNJU|5.0|I fell head over heels for this movie when it was first released, and I thought the DVD version was amazing. I am so HAPPY that I bought the Blu-Ray, and for no more than a little spare change to boot. The Blu-Ray looks marvelous, and has got to be the demo disc to end them all. If you want to showcase to friends and family how Blu-Ray has modernized video and audio quality, you have to get this. It comes with a DVD copy of the film and the packaging is very nice too. 5 stars for Universal. Amazing, Mind-Blowing entertainment, and quite tripped-out too!!
0525478817|3.0|\\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" currently has almost overwhelmingly positive response, pretty much everyone I know has given it 5 stars, thus I'm certain no one would want to read my sour musings, except me and maybe a couple of other like-minded and unimpressed.<br /><br />What I'd love to know is this - what makes a writer to undertake the topic of cancer? So much has already been written about it, so many Lifetime movies filmed, so many tears shed. It literally has been done to death. What new did John Green have to bring to the cancer table?<br /><br />The way I see it, nothing. Having your terminally sick characters be ironic about their illnesses and swap cancer jokes isn't groundbreaking.<br /><br />\\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" isn't a bad book, but it's a standard cancer book, and, sadly, a standard John Green book, with standard John Green humor and standard John Green characters.<br /><br />You have a witty and intelligent protagonist (this time 2, Hazel and Augustus - a female and male versions of Miles/Quentin/Colin), a funny, slightly pathetic sidekick (Isaac - another version of Hassan/Chip/Marcus), a mysterious, unhinged girl, Gus's dead ex (Alaska/Margo clone), and, of course, the signature ROAD TRIP. I can't help but recognize these people and this plot, I've read all of Green's novels.<br /><br />I understand why so many readers would have such an emotional response to the book. Nothing will get the ladies crying quicker than a kid dying of cancer. Add in some long farewells, painkillers, eulogies and funerals - you can collect buckets of tears. But, IMO, here Green aims for the most obvious, the most easily accessible emotions, for the most typical \\"life lessons.\\"<br /><br />Frankly, I think \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is Green's weakest work to date, weaker even than half-baked \\"Zombicorns.\\" Because this, unlike his earlier works, feels commercial and intentionally tearjerky and insincere. It will probably sell the most copies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game besides the ads. Once you get used to them though, there's nothing bad about the endless supply (almost) of mini games! It's so worth it!
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This movie was everything i thought it would be. Better than the older versions, and  much better than 2009 version. Everyone who likes \\"sify, drama,etc; should purchase this movie for watching over, over, and over again. The price I paid to buy at Amazon  is a difference of about $7 less than any place ii buy dvd's.[[ASIN:B004LWZW4W Rise of the Planet of the Apes (Two-Disc Edition Blu Ray + DVD/Digital Copy Combo) [Blu-ray]]]
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Kindle Fire user. A great free game with excellent graphics, gameplay, and sound effects.  The music in the Western stage was suitably reminiscent of Ennio Morricone.  Nice touch!  I personally did not find the ads obtrusive...they definitely did not obstruct view of the pinball nor flipper control.
B0031MA7RA|5.0|A brilliant book.  I've bought several copies and given them away to deserving friends who could appreciate Jill Bolte Taylor's masterpiece.  Dr. Taylor had a stroke; a bleed started in her left brain and her database was all but wiped out.  She had enough courage in the morning when the bleed started and her thought processes and data were being wiped away, to call a colleague at Harvard Medical School and was able to make him understand that he needed to send help.  With the support of her sensitive and intelligent mother, she started the very lengthy healing process back to health.  Dr. Taylor learned a great deal about herself during her journey back which inevitably changed her.  She became more sensitive, more humane, more human and, if anything, even more intelligent, coming to understand differently how and what to achieve.  It's an overwhelming book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is by far the best game or 101 games I have this game is really great, I would reccomend it to anyone who likes fun.
0375826726|1.0|Read it when it came out, and I just saw that it had remained on my wish list from before its publication. I instantly deleted and am writing this review to warn people off...  While reading this book I constantly had to push myself to read page after page of plot lines which in the end proved meaningless, and unless they are useful and explained at some point in the fourth book (FOURTH????) they will remain utterly pointless and -to me- not entertaining. Eragon as a character while interesting in the first book, grew less so in the second one and lost my interest completely in this one. As indicated above I was surprised to find that Mr Paolini published a fourth book in the series (which after reading Brisingr I am hardly inclined to buy).  Overall, this was the book that turned me off this series completely so unless you are completely enthralled with the previous two books and the characters then you could definitely spend your money on something far more enjoyable and well written.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|well worth the 2 bucks. combines turn based rpgs with sn well structured money system. different classes and skills give it amazing replay value. Ive never beaten the game but I love it and am writing this review. that's how good this is. a must have for any rpgs fan.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I bought this movie to see the first story before watching Sherlock Homes 2 in movie theatre. The quality of the vision is so good, and story is also exciting.
B00003CXBK|4.0|i ordered this movie on DVD because i had it originally on VHS. the shipping was fairly quick and i was happy about that. the only problem was a few times in the movie it would freeze. only for about 4-5 seconds but still, i was a bit unhappy about it. other than that its a great movie and was very easy and convenient to buy
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I was really enlightened  as to the History of the Progress the African American Women have made through their suffering and humiliation, at home and workplace ..I was raised in the North during the 50's and 60's and went to integrated ( maybe 4 or 5 Black Students ) school, so didn't realize at that age the racial problems..I nowe live in the South and I don't think this Movie even made it to our Theaters , if it did it may have been their a day ir two..Whil reading the Book, I have had several people comment that they also loved the book ,but the movie never played in our area..
B005EYP8PO|5.0|First, I'll say something that will get a few people PO'd.  If you are listening to this disc on a stereo system whose total cost was under $5,000.00, (minimum) or God forbid through an MP3 player, then you can't even begin to appreciate the genius of the mix of this album.  These are just the facts, don't shoot the messenger.  Is the new \\"upgrade\\" worth it ?  Yes, but don't expect to be blown away by things you have never heard before. (Look to the upgraded \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" for that effect)  \\"Achtung Baby\\" is sonic perfection, and was way ahead of it's time, much like The Beatles' \\"Abbey Road\\" was in it's day.  But, it demands a quality system to bring out it's glory, and most cheaper stereos are simply incapable of doing that.
B003TJR2HS|2.0|i bought a Sony dream machine during the black Friday sales last year for my ipod touch 4g. i thought it was going to be compatible for my ipod, but it wasn't so i wasn't able to play my music or charge my ipod. someone told me about this thing and said that it will work. i waited and waited for this thing to come and when it finally did it did absolutely nothing. save your money and don't buy it.
B005T87QCI|3.0|love it. it is really hard though since you pick from bad robots. I could barely even get past the first few rounds.
0525478817|5.0|This is John Green's best work yet. It has everything his fans have come to expect from him: great writing, lovable, witty characters, complicated lives, oodles of literary references, and a philosophical twist, all wrapped in a highly readable story about life and love and fate. I laughed, I cried, I tore through this book in a day, and I was sorry to see it end.<br /><br />I was a bit frustrated with the lack of development with the Peter Van Houten character, as something seemed rushed or missing there, but otherwise, this book was everything I needed from a young adult read. I am going to miss these characters, and I'll be waiting to read whatever John Green writes next.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|YouVersion app is absolutely amazing. I can synch multiple devices and continue my reading without flaw or delay. it it wonderful for my daily devotional for my personal spiritual growth and truly is amazing. God continue to use this app and the folks behind it for His Glory!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was a great game and I love wasting time on it its really a good use of time when your bored. everyone try it! -love
0007166311|2.0|I want to listen to this book, truly I do.  And I know that I'll like it because it's right up my alley.  But I could not get through the first disk.  Why do some authors insist on reading their own books?  Is it to save a buck?  Is it because they think they can do it better justice than an actor?  Well, they're wrong in most cases.  I couldn't get past the dramatic (or otherwise) pauses this author used, sometimes between every word in a single sentence.  Usually, I hang in there and even an annoying voice starts to grow on me or becomes tolerable.  This was painful though.  So I guess I'll have to do it the good old fashioned way, and download it to my Kindle.  :-)
B004JN1D2I|3.0|I loved the first two books in this bundle, despite the continued loss of favorite characters and repeated cliff hangers, but began to struggle with the meandering plot and abject violence in the third and was wrung out and defeated by a lack of plot progress in the fourth book. As much as I want to know what happens, I don't think I'll subject myself to the fifth book right now. I'm exhausted by this series. There is no doubt the GRR Martin created a rich and fascinating world, filling it with many memorable characters, and a highly complex plot, but this began to feel like The Lord of the Rings without a soul after my marathon read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think.it takes too long to unlock games but it's pretty fun.  for free it's pretty awesome. I'd reccomend it
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|I love this movie and can watch it again and again without getting bored. I love the actors, the plot, and the writing. It was a great mix of sweet, sad, and humorous. Even though my fiance actually doesn't usually like romantic comedies, she loves this movie too!
B003H6KRIE|5.0|First, you know that the movies are amazing.  The action starts strong and never lets up over the course of all three films.  Aside from one or two quibbles (why does mr superspy who memorizes every liscense plate in a parking lot at one glance need to have something implanted in his hip to remind him of his bank account?  Just in case he loses his memory?) the movies themselves are wonderful.  Here are the pros and cons of this particular edition of the films:  Pros:  -the blu ray transfer is good, with a fine picture and sound.  -the extras are fun.  Cons:  -These are the single-disk versions of the movies.  No dvd or additional disks such as digital copy.  -At times the picture quality was not as good as I might have hoped.  Still very good, but a bit off.  All in all, highly recommended.  If you like Bourne, you will like this package.  If you like action films, you will love Bourne.  If you don't like action films, then why are you reading this at all?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|After playing this game for hours, I still am yet to get to level three. I have been earning sooo much money that other people have been asking me to play for them! I have never played a game that was THIS addicting!
0670022411|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, so I kept reading and expecting something to happen and for it to get exciting somewhere. But it's like watching a movie that never goes anywhere, and when it's over you wonder why you wasted those hours of your life on it. The main characters manage to go through the entire book without even consummating their \\"marriage.\\" That shows what little happens in this story. There are very detailed explanations of architecture, libraries and how things smell and look, but that's about it. And her witchcraft kept reminding me of watching the show \\"Bewitched.\\" I definitely won't be reading the next two. For a trilogy to be interesting, there needs to be 3 different and very interesting stories. This was like the first act of a bad play, so I'm leaving during intermission.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Everything runs smoothly. No glitches and I've played long enough to know if there were going to be a glitch. Very addicting card game.
B005HI4LLY|4.0|4 stars = Classic<br /><br />An instant classic!<br /><br />\\"Tucker & Dale vs. Evil\\" is a hilarious black comedic spoof of the demented, murderous, redneck/hillbilly sub-genre. Not what you'd think it is, but a clever original twist on the whole post \\"Deliverance\\" hillbilly maniac theme, with a million winks, nods, & guffaws, to all those movies that make you afraid to go out in the country.<br /><br />Funny stuff!
B003Z2LAAO|2.0|I guess I should have paid more attention to the actual title of this DVD. As a new Sony 3D LED owner, I was looking for something reasonable to show off the 3D capabilities of my new TV to friends and family. The other reviews on Amazon gave it high marks for its 3D effects and that sold me. Less than 5 minutes into the video, I realize it's a product of the environmental movement that seems to think we should put everything back the way it was 50 years ago. One example early on is a statement that environmental activists are debating the pros and cons of tearing down the Glen Canyon dam so that the silt that is prevented from traveling further down the Colorado River can be reintroduced. I noted on the cover as soon as I opened it that it was narrated by Robert Redford and on the back cover it reveals that Robert Kennedy, also a known environmental activist, was one of the principle characters. One or both of them make references to global warming as though it's accepted fact when we know that's not the case...even scientists can't agree it's happening. All in all, I'm quite disappointed in this Bluray DVD, and I think if I ever watch it again, I'll turn off the audio and just enjoy the scenic shots.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|This book was unbelievably sweet. It sat on my virtual kindle shelf for a few months before I finally got around to reading it. Once I started, I kicked myself- all those months, and this pleasant read was just a few unsuspecting feet away! Lola is a lovable character, quirky and alive and endearing. Her situation gave me that same feeling I often get when listening to my own girlfriends talk about boys- that the obvious truth of their feelings is often sitting right in front of them in plain sight. It takes a few good friends and a pair of supportive fathers for Lola to find what she's looking for, but by the time she does, she'll have you cheering her on. This story really brightened my day- I loved it! And Cricket Bell...don't even get me started...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think it is fun and so do my kids...we love trying to finish one game just to be able to move on to the next game and also like to try to beat each others high scores.. I'm glad it was a free download also.. love it..

B0063IH60K|4.0|love this game. Its fun. its your typical solitaire game. settings are also pretty good. graphics are not bad. would definitely recommend this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|you get what you pay for. probably best suited for times when you are just looking for a little brain down time.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Fantastic app to help remember things when I am out and about. I run Evernote on my PC, my phone, and my Kindle and it is amazing to have all of my notes with me for easy recall.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was, indeed, a great movie and great  history lesson.  I recommend it for every-  one.  In addition to the story itself, the  acting was excellent.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I'll part companies with some other reviewers, there is nothing redunant about this outstanding series. I own the Planet Earth videos and a number of other amazing BBC nature documentaries (including all of the Attenborough ones). New footage, new ideas, and it follows the natural development of life forms (particularly animals) by continually flashing from present to past. Amazingly done, and Attenborough is one-of-a-kind!
B005HWUCMC|4.0|I like Rihanna's music and acually already had this cd, it was skip'n cause i didnt take care of my cd i couldnt take it anymore so i just had to order same one again. Good cd.
0439023521|5.0|This book series is amazing. Suzanne Collins has you hooked in the first sentence. I heard a lot of people talking about this book and knew nothing about it, so I decided to download it to my kindle fire and started reading , I found myself not able to stop. I fell in love with the main character Katniss, she is skilled and smart and I love the way she thinks. The book is about Katniss who volunteers to take her sisters place in the hunger games , which is this competition where a boy and a girl from each of the 12 districts  are put into a large arena that could be anything from a desert to a forest and they must fight each other to the death until their is only one left. This book is packed with action, love, sadness, pretty much all human emotions. Collins has created this amazing world that isn't too far from reality. Even if you are skeptical about reading it or it doesn't sound like something you would read , I would highly recommend reading a preview of the book, I did and I ended up loving it.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I feel as if I've just returned from a long journey...one where I traveled with someone from vacuity and solitude to repletion and felicity. This trilogy is written from the point of view of the heroine; but to me, it's a summation of the journey of the hero, Christian.  The further glimpses of Christian's past that the author gives us in this book reminds us of a sad fact: that the story of his childhood is painfully similar to one many people could tell...of abuse, neglect, and heartache. Admittedly, he is extremely lucky to have been adopted by the Greys, a wealthy and loving family. But is that the true deciding factor that has made him so driven to succeed and be in control? Or is it something else, something from within himself, that gave him the impetus to succeed beyond anyone's expectations?  To contrast this, the author has given us Jack, who has a very similar story to Christian's for his childhood...and an almost enviable outcome for Jack's family resolution. Yet Jack made a choice to become something truly malicious, allowing his painful-set-in-stone-past to control his oh-so-malleable present and future. Sure, Christian had his 'issues' to deal with, and 'singular' tastes, but he recognized that and made a choice to hold himself to a standard (i.e., contracts and hard limits--all lifestyle choices of consenting adults, not a psychiatric disorder, as per the good Dr. Flynn). Of course when Ana came into his life, all that was turned upside down :) and he had to make new choices, new decisions about what he wanted his life to look like.  I am reminded that we all have tough times in our lives, some much worse than others. To quote a favorite song of mine(paraphrased) \\"Yesterday is a wrinkle on your forehead.....This is your life and today is all you've got now, and today is all you'll ever have....This is your life, are you who you wanna be?\\" We must make the choice at some point in our lives to either let our past control us and dwell upon it, laying the blame for any misdeed we wish to perform at it's ugly, calloused feet (Jack)...or to accept that the past has made us into who we are today, but that it can be overcome and dealt with in a manner such that it doesn't interfere with our goals in life (Christian). In this final book, we see Christian struggle with more decisions as he makes additional adjustments to let go of his past, to realize that he is a good person, and that he can obtain happiness with Ana.  Ana shows growth as well, she learns not to be so demanding of Christian for information, and how to assert herself with her husband's plethora of admirers.  She grows from a shy, insecure girl into a self-assured young lady who can take care of her own interests.  What an inspiration, as well as a wonderful love story; the events and dialogue will likely stay with me for a long time to come. Thank you, Ms. James, very much, for sharing Christian with us all. xx
B005IU1OMA|5.0|\\"The Art of Flight\\" Represents State-of-the-Art Blu-ray  (Interview with Joel silver by Robert Archer CE Pro Magazine, January 24, 2012)  It's amazing how driven audio and video enthusiasts are to find the next great audiophile recording or reference-level video release.  Joel Silver is president and founder of the Imaging Science Foundation (ISF), and a massive home theater enthusiast. So it's not surprising when he says that custom installers have to know about a specific video because its quality is so good.  Silver's latest video recommendation is The Art of Flight, and according to the industry's leading video authority, this Blu-ray is the newest ISF reference disc for sound and picture quality in a home video release.  The Art of Flight is a documentary from Red Bull Media House and Brain Farm Digital Cinema that follows the exploits of extreme snowboarders Travis Rice and his friends as they tackle some of the most mountainous terrain in the world.  Silver notes that the video was edited in post production using Dolby Laboratories' PRM-4200 Professional Reference Monitor that employs the company's Dual-Modulation Display Technology. He adds that it was released with a dynamic Dolby TrueHD 7.1 soundtrack.  Silver says that Dolby's new display and companion display technology is truly state-of-the-art, and that because of the monitor's capabilities the post-production team was able to create one of the best-looking Blu-ray videos ever released. \\"Dolby flexed its muscle with this disc,\\" he says. \\"Dolby used the disc at CES [International Consumer Electronics Show] and I'm using it at my house. Right now if you visit me, you'll get a glass of wine and this video on my screen.\\"  Narrowing down his choices of what scenes he suggests to use as demo content was not easy. Silver points out that everything about the video is good, but he mentions the fourth chapter is a good place to start. \\"Chapter four has a chopper and a plane that are dropping the extreme snowboarders onto a mountain peak,\\" he explains. \\"At this point, make sure you have enough light output on your video and a good audio system that can handle low-end content. It is a rare system that can handle these elements. Look at the contrast and listen to the sound ... the color saturation.\\"  Emphatically, Silver summarizes The Art of Flight by saying, \\"there isn't a bad part on this disc. This is a 7.1 production done on a state-of-the-art monitor with great camera work ... this disc has it all. I don't know of any Blu-ray discs that look this good; this is what Blu-ray discs are supposed to look and sound like.  \\"Dealers have to have this disc, I'm not even a snowboarder, but it makes me want to jump on a snowboard.\\"
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|And it's terrible. The real Missile Command was a fun game, but this is far from it. The look of it is the same but the interface is horrendous. It's a free Atari game that is basically an add for everything they sell. It's trash, don't DL it please.  Ruckischmuckle
0446573019|3.0|I've read everything Baldacci has written to this point, and have enjoyed it all. I looked forward to this latest offering with a pleasant anticipation of intrigue, suspense.<br />Unfortunately, this book lacked the flow and voice of Mr. Baldacci's prior books. For me, it fell somewhat flat. Characters were introduced and dropped, left undeveloped, not usual in his prior books.<br />A heroic military intelligence detective with family issues sent to help the locals investigate mysterious, seemingly motiveless murders of a DIA agent and his family in rural West Virginia. A sheriff's deputy is murdered, more bodies turn up, bombs go off, drugs come on the scene, a terrorist angle is thrown in, yet no further federal assistance is sent.<br />Events often seemed disjointed or disconnected. Characters weren't as fully developed after introduction as in past Baldacci novels and many of them quickly discarded. Clues, as they were presented, seemed less part of the story and unimportant.<br />One of the things that made it less believable for me was that the U.S. military wouldn't send enough personnel to conduct thorough investigation. Puller was competent, but sending him alone to deal with the situation was a potentially disasterous PR decision. Never mind the fact our government is notorious for OVER investigating every little thing.

There were plenty of bookmarks and the ability to add your own in anywhere. Overall it was a great book app and a great read to boot. I have no regrets and it was worth every penny.  Ruckischmuckle

B005PYZG6E|1.0|Impossible to stabilize with my t2i with 15-85mm lens. I had to put a 2.5lb free way on the bottom to 'sort of' stabilize it. Even the 50mm 1.4 was barely manageable. The gimbal is terrible and is nearly impossible to get a fluid side to side shot. You end up with the thing rocking even when you slowly come to a stop. Dont waste your money, I read the reviews and took a gamble.
B0017VG69U|5.0|I bought the first and second seasons of the original series, and I love them. The extras are also nice, including interviews with surviving cast members, but it is the ability to have the entire season, uncut and minus the commercials, that is really great. If you are an original series fan, you can't miss with these DVDs.
B002BWP49M|1.0|I saw this movie for fun but did not expect it to be the worst in every aspect. Everyone including main and supporting actors need to re- evaluate their acting abilities and I know it is not their fault to a degree but breaking dawn was super embarrassing and painfully hilarious to watch.

1573225517|5.0|Hornby has hit the proverbial home run with this novel.  The characters are likeable, strike a nerve, and provide power for the reader to grab onto.  Their eccentricities and testosterone inhibited brain power combine for an unforgettably all too real expose on male/female relationships.  Hornby delves into the methods of male thinking that most likely all or at least 90% of us have at one time or another used to get us into more trouble than the answers we were seeking were worth.<br /><br />As the main character floats through life from one relationship to another, he gathers into himself the rationalizations that we all at one time or another utilize.  As you read them in this setting, you begin to relax and realize that maybe, just maybe you aren't the only one in the universe with these tendencies.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book for anyone that wants to read something that push their minds into the past for a look inward at themselves.  To top it off, the writing is superb.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game keeps me occupied in my spare time. It is way better than having to reset the cards every time on a table.

B001R10BMS|4.0|I purchased this movie to add to my collection of James Bond Movies.  I know this is not one of the offical James Bond Movies, from the UA franchise but it does star Sean Connrey so I wanted to add it to my collection.  A bit more cheesy considering his past 007 movies, but I enjoyed it just the same.

1451627289|5.0|I can't recommend this book highly enough. It contains all the trappings of great fiction - suspense, danger, love, the possible end of everything. Written in first person, it's witty and full of great nostalgic bits from the late 50's - early 60's. If you had to take just one book to a desert island with you, take this. I only had it for a week from the library but I'm going to buy it. Too good not to take off the shelf and just open and read.

B0041KKYDI|4.0|Aron Ralston goes hiking in the canyonlands of Utah where, in a freak accident, his arm becomes trapped underneath a boulder. With little water and no hope of rescue his survival depends on a cheap, blunt pocket knife and a lot of courage.<br /><br />Directed by Danny Boyle, 127 hours is based on [[ASIN:1849833907 a true story]] and is one of a small genre of factual \\"man vs the mountain\\" survival films such as [[ASIN:B000S399II Touching The Void]] or [[ASIN:B000059H2A Alive]]. Now, by their nature, these stories rely for their dramatic value on /how/ the protagonist survived, rather than /if/. Ralston did it by cutting off his arm. I'm sorry if that's a spoiler but if you are even a little squeamish (as I am) you really do need to know that because the amputation is presented in graphic detail. What's more, it's probably not enough simply to look away at the crucial moment - you may want to block your ears as well.<br /><br />Thhe film is beautifully directed; I don't know Boyle's work very well but there seems to be to be some very strong parallels with another of his works - [[ASIN:B000S6UZEM Sunshine]]. Thus he effortlessly trades between huge, majestic and colourful landscapes and intimate, even claustrophobic, shots. His eye for the surreal also comes through in this film in both his depiction of the stunning canyon landscapes and Ralston's increasingly fragile mental state. There are a few strange \\"Dallas\\"-like split screen scenes; I'm not entirely sure what these were meant to convey but they give the opening scenes a false, somewhat soapy feel. By contrast, a brief apeparance at the end by the real Aron Ralson (and wife) grounds the film nicely in reality.<br /><br />Boyle described the film as an \\"[[ASIN:B00007KGCK an action movie with a guy who can't move]]\\" and, concentrating as it does, on Ralston's five day predicament, the cast is understandably small. James Franco plays the leading role rather well, starting with a rather bumptious, self-assured and mildly unlikeable character and, having taken him through a wide range of emotions, brings him out the other side in a much more sympathetic light. He stands up well to Ralston's punishing dilemma and also to Boyle's intrusive camerawork and his performance was widely and justly praised. He doesn't negotiate the film entirely alone and the appearance, in various flashbacks and hallucinations, of his friends and family detract somewhat from the central premise (in my opinion).<br /><br />In the final analysis, this is, for the most part, an absorbing and enjoyable film, which explores the subjects of despair, hope and strength of spirit. A strong constitution will be needed to negotiate the \\"money shot\\" but it's well worth it in the end.d, having taken him through a wide range of emotions, brings him out the other side in a much more sympathetic light.

B004E9SU14|4.0|I'm not going to be one of those people that pretends they know more about music then they should. They get on their high horse and make up rubbish about why something is good, bad, or how it could be better. This album is one of my favorites to come out of the past year. It has a cute Beatles-esque feel to it at some points which I enjoy. Generally, it's just an entertaining pop album.

B005C7SXMS|3.0|It's quirky, it's funny, and I genuinely enjoyed it. That said, it's certainly not ground breaking or particularly memorable, and I'd say one viewing was plenty. Cinematography is nice enough, and the picture looks pretty good, and I could understand everybody through their accents, so the sound's pretty well done also. I like the design of the cover, though the title might throw some people, as there's not much to do with submarines! Worth a view on a lazy afternoon, but nothing to get too excited about.

0545265355|5.0|I did not read these books when they came out, I actually had never even heard of them until my sister was reading it and out of curiosity (and after seeing the trailer) I decided to read them. I read all three within about a week!The books were SO amazing that I read them all once,&I read them again just to make sure I didn't miss a thing!! And I have never read the same book twice..never really understood that concept until now. I won't tell anything about the books because that is what the description is for. I would suggest them to anyone, any age. I cannot stress how obsessed I am. I know they are being compared to twilight and honestly I don't understand the comparison! A lot of people have said they won't read them if they are compared to twilight..but who cares. If you are bothered by a book becoming a HUGE hit then I wouldn't suggest reading any of them because I'm sure thats what will happen once the movie is released. I personally don't care if the movie is great or not because the books are still amazing!! and the more popular it is..the better the movie quality will be I hope! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
1451648537|2.0|This book is clearly meant to \\"make a buck\\" off of the recent passing of Steve Jobs. It has been quickly put together as there is no flow to the book. It's jumps from one story to another with no continuity. It does try to follow a timeline but each chapter is so isolated from the other you loose track of where you are in Mr. Jobs life. While reading some of the passages there are quotes and lines in there from previous publications. A lot of what you read is simply a rehash of old news. The book can use a serious re-write.  Reading this is like reading a Magazine article. Quick, simple and to the point. No depth, no insight and it doesn't read like a well crafted biography. It's a bunch of reused interviews and snapshots from Steve's life that have been collected and quickly put into print so the masses can read it.  Does it get the job done, yes. It it selling like crazy, yes. Is it an educational and thought provoking book that tells me what Steve Jobs was all about and what makes him tick, not at all. For such a powerful and influential person, this book is hollow and only scratches the surface of what his biography \\"should\\" be like.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|I must disagree with many of the prior negative reviews for this product. Dylan fans can be merciless critics of anyone that attempts to cover his songs and as such, it is not surprising that there are so many Dylanphiles coming out against this set of CD's. I would argue that this is not a CD for Dylan fans, instead it is meant as a celebration of his songwriting craft and an examination on the ways in which his songs have become interwoven into American popular music. No other songwriter, save perhaps Gershwin, could claim to have had such a huge impact on American song, and what is amazing about Dylan is how relevant his work still is. While Gershwin songs might be inextricably linked to his era, this album shows just how well Dylan's songs integrate into the modern day. Just the fact that former-Disney tween sensation Miley Cyrus could produce a potential hit with a Dylan song today is quite amazing.  The songs on this album are cut in almost every imaginable style of American and World popular music. There are folk songs, torch songs, jazz ballads, blues songs, bluegrass songs, country songs, rock songs and indie rock songs. As such, no listener will probably like every one, but I will go so far as to say that every single song on here is worth hearing at least once. I imagine that every song will have fans of one sort or another. It is also interesting how, based on prior reviews at least, there is clear evidence of a generation gap among this album's listeners. I would actually vehemently disagree with the concensus of the older fans here who believe that the older guard of artists (Baez, Patti Smith, Knopfler, Joe Perry, et. al.) do these songs better. I am much more intrigued by the ways that the younger artists from all over the world handle themselves on the album. Just as many older music fans tend to write off any contemporary music as uninteresting, many older Dylan fans have little time for the younger artists on this set because the modern styles arenot to their liking. If you have an open mind about these fantastic songs, it is amazing the ways in which many of them are brought into the 21st century, often in unexpected ways--the beautiful harmonies and tones of Boots of Spanish Leather for instance or the intriguing electronic instrumentation of I Want You. Granted, neither sounds like Dylan did them, but that's the point of the album, to offer updated interpretations of these wonderful songs. This is the album to play for those who say that Dylan is primarily a lyricist. What jumps out about these productions is the sheer musicality behind the songs which takes even the lesser songs like I'll Remember You (which is embarrassingly bad on Empire Burlesque) into eye-opening new places. Highly recommended but only for those who can approach these songs with an open musical mind and accept the fact that Dylan's songs will be taken in experimental and contemporary directions.

0439023521|5.0|I didn't have the highest expectations of this book, but immediatlely became captivated by it.  I can definitely say it's the best book of the year that I've engorged myself in.  I do hope that readers go away from it with lessons on the corruption of too much Corporate or Government Power, the loss of individual civil liberties, and the immorality of enormous discrepancies in wealth.  The Hunger Games will leave a lasting legacy on issues of violence and injustice in our society.  While it can get quite dark for a 12 year old, I would highly recommend it to all adults.<br /><br />Paul Harris<br />Author, \\"Diary From the Dome, Reflections on Fear and Privilege During Katrina\\"
0780626966|5.0|A must have for Freddy fans. All of the original films on dvd with the original Matthew Peak poster designs on the cover (except part 6). Can't beat that. I only wish that some deleted scenes would have been included, and that part 5 would have been the uncut version. Maybe in the next box set?

The little frog/lizard has some entertaining animations. And, the little gulp sound open eating a candy is great.  The developer adds new levels often providing a good amount of bang for your buck. Easily one of the best games on the Android platform.
B00005KHJV|5.0|This is the version that I grew up with. As a kid I originally saw Halloween on TV, so those extra scenes are quite nostalgic for me and I'm glad that Anchor Bay has inserted them back into the movie. This is the way Halloween should be seen!
B00008G7UJ|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I'm a dude but I love the way it's shot. Sure I'm a 5-starring fan boy but this movie deserves more credit than IMDb gives it(6.8 right now, AYFKM?)<br /><br />It's a MOVIE, Shakespeare is not lounging back watching the play. This is an INTERPRETATION of Shakespeare's work and it is a MASTERPIECE in it's own right. Leo does a GREAT job as well as Claire Danes. It's excellent, eerie, unique, and very interestingly shot and portrayed. It is pretty uniform with the way it was worked too, despite being shot in California and almost not looking like it... though I've never been to the West Coast so I don't know too much. LOVE this god damn movie.
0634022296|5.0|The book every guitar-playing Beatle fan should have. After years of buying books with various songs, finally, a book with \\"just about\\" all the songs (194), and the chords are spot on and in the original keys. Thank you, Rikky Rooksby.

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great DVD for someone that's just starting out.  I started this DVD about 20 days ago, and I am now on Day 15 of the workout.  I can't stand Jillian, but she's pretty good at what she does.  More often than not, I mute the television and turn on regular music so I don't have to hear her voice.  Before I started this DVD, I was completely unfit, and hadn't regularly worked out EVER.  I've purchased several workout videos, but never stuck with them.  I think this works for me because it only takes about 25 minutes out of my day, yet I feel like I've actually accomplished something. It's really great when I think about how unfit I was when I started, and how much I've advanced in just 15 days.  I think that this is definitely something I can stick to, and I will continue working out after the 30 days are over, whether it be with another Jillian DVD, or something else.  This workout has helped change my outlook on working out regularly.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I think this is the first thing I have ever reviewed on Amazon, and that's really saying something.  I have been a Prime member since the first day it became available in 2005.  I have ordered so many things on Amazon, and have never felt inspired enough to write a review...until now.<br /><br />I preordered my Kindle Fire the very day they were announced.  I have had my Fire since the first day they were delivered, and it has hardly left my hand since.  I love it and use it constantly.  I originally had a zip sleeve for the Fire, as I have never really been a fan of covers for my K3.  But, after realizing that I wanted a way to stand the Fire up when I was watching a video, I started looking for a cover.  I looked at this one, at first, and was really attracted to how slim it was.  I liked the fact that it was protective, but added almost no bulk at all (I like to hold my Fire one-handed).  It was, however, $39.99 at the time and that seemed like too much.  I wound up going with a less expensive model from another manufacturer...big mistake.  It was hard to get the Kindle in and out of it, and when the cover was folded back it made it way too thick, so it was uncomfortable to hold one-handed.<br /><br />I finally came around and ordered this cover from Marware and I am so happy that I did.  As soon as I took it out of the packaging I knew I was going to love it.  My Fire snapped in place in seconds and feels incredibly secure.  I really like how snug it fits, and the base of the cover has got the rubbery sort of feel that the back of the Fire has.  It has a very pleasing feel.  I like that the base is slightly deeper than the Fire is thick so that, when the Fire is in the case, the base provides a slight lip for a little added protection.  If your Fire was in this case and landed screen down, the screen would not hit the floor.  The slight little lip would protect it from direct impact.<br /><br />I also like the covering flap.  The microfiber interior really does help to protect the screen from scratches, and it also helps to remove fingerprints as they accumulate through ordinary usage.  I love the way you can fold the cover back completely and tuck it under the elastic strap.  With the cover folded back, and as a result of how slim the base is, I can hold the Fire in one hand just as easily as I can without the cover on at all.  That's exactly what I wanted: a cover that would protect, but be practically invisible.<br /><br />I have also experimented with the stand functionality.  The cover came being very flexible right out of the box, so I have had no trouble with getting the Fire to stand correctly.  Having said that, though, you really will need to use the stand on a hard surface.  It's not really cut out to be all that effective on a soft surface.<br /><br />Again, I love everything about this cover.  I should have gotten this from the very beginning.  If you are hesitating at all, then stop.  Add it to your cart and check out...right now.  You won't be disappointed.m scratches, and it also helps to remove fingerprints as they accumulate through ordinary usage.

B005KDWUFA|5.0|This cd, \\"Wicked Game\\", is awesome, the reasons being the songs are lovely and done in a fresh way and the singers  have never sounded better in my humble opinion.  'Crying' (Llorando) is the best song on the album, and \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" a close second. Urs, Seb, David, and Carlos, don't stop doing what you do!
0385738773|3.0|This book didn't have nearly the suspense of the first two. I still think Maze Runner was the best. *SPOILER**** This book deals with the kids escaping from WICKED, they are no longer in the trials, or being set up, or anything. I thought a perfect ending would have been for the kids to be on the island, and the island was itself still part of WICKED and they were still being tested while on the island!! Just when they thought they were safe, they were still being watched!! That would have been sweet. I don't feel this book \\"added\\" to the trilogy. I would have been just as happy to have only read the first two books.

B0012GMYUU|5.0|Jeff Beck is a master of the electric guitar. This recording is yet another excellent example of his brilliance. Just like BB King he began his career by building his own guitar out of the odds and ends he could find as a child displaying an overpowering need to make music that is still apparent in his playing today.  The shivering, jagged edged guitar work on \\"Dirty Mind\\", hard driving energy on \\"Loose Cannon\\", and frenzied licks on \\"Rosebud\\" by Mr. Beck, send a spark up the spine straight to the brain. The relentless, deft skills behind \\"Dirty Mind\\", counterpointed by the wonderfully innovative and spontaneous British singer Imogene Heap, is an example of what a brilliant 55 year old guitarist is capable of.  Jeff Beck is a living legend whose chops can still be considered an obbligato for the electric guitar.

0525478817|4.0|This is an incredibly powerful story that rings true to anyone who has dealt with cancer in his or her life.  The quotable parts are too many to mention and the tears just kept coming for the last several chapters of the book.  Although there is plenty of sadness, the tears for me were more about the reality of the situation and the way in which the author handled the subject.  My only complaint would be that both Hazel and Augustus seemed too unbelievably articulate and clever in everything they said.  However, this is a minor complaint given the overall impact of the book.

B006OFN0BQ|5.0|First, I must start by saying that I'm not an uncoditional fan of either Clint Eastwood or Leonardo DiCaprio. I find many Eastwood films excessively solemn and on the service of somewhat melodramatic material (like the overrated Mystic River). As for DiCaprio, although his seriousness and commitment to acting has never seemed in doubt, he has seemed somewhat lightweight or miscast in many of his role.<br />But this time, and despite being ignored by the Academy, Eastwood and DiCaprio, aided by a superb script by Dustin Lance Black, have stricken gold. DiCaprio has probably never had a role as demanding as this and Eastwood brings out the best in him.<br />And the material perfectly suits Eastwood autumnal, melancholic tone this time, as we are talking about an American Epic, and the history of one of the most powerful men in the history of the United States. One of the most rewarding aspects of Eastwood's history films (as with Flags of Our Fathers), is that the director makes you take a fresh point of view. At this point in history, Hoover is equated in most of our minds with power mad, cross dressing, closeted bad guy, and then the movie reminds you of the man's instrumental role in building the FBI; yes, his tactics were nasty and he always took all the credit, but he helped bring crimefighting to a whole new level. The movie does a good balancing act of showing Hoover the Brilliant Man and Hoover the monster, if maybe at the end the portrayal might feel a little too sympathetic or apologetic. This would be more directed at Hoover the person, than at Hoover the politician, who is shown blackmailing several presidents and wiretapping Martin Luther King.<br />When it comes to his personal life, the movie stirred quite a bit of controversy, as some people felt that the fact that Hoover was most likely a closeted homosexual could have been show more forcefully, and that it was just suggested; in fact the movie seemed to me quite clear on the subject.<br />DiCaprio immerses completely in the role, and we finally can forget Leo the pretty boy, and watch the actor: awkard around women, smitten by a handsome new colleague, ferocious and bombastic speaking in public, shameless in playing hardball with people like RFK. It is an amazing performance and probably the best by an American actor in 2011. Equally fine are Arne Hammer, as Hoover's longtime companion, and Naomi Watts, as his lifetime secretary.<br />It is impossible to come out of a biographical or historical picture with a comprehensive view of its subject, at best it's a starting point to delve deeper in the subjects it explores. In this, J. Edgar does an impressive job, and kudos to Eastwood and DiCaprio for embarking in such an ambitious venture.merses completely in the role, and we finally can forget Leo the pretty boy, and watch the actor: awkard around women, smitten by a handsome new colleague, ferocious and bombastic speaking in public, shameless in playing hardball with people like RFK.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|I have purchased a number of Blu-ray movies, and this Star Wars set is one of the better quality transfers.  However, the book packaging (instead of the standard plastic Blu-ray jewel cases) caused me to give this product only 4 stars. Over time, the book will soil, ding, warp, and peel. It is also difficult getting the discs in and out of their cardboard sleeves (and the bottom of the discs are always scraped whenever I do).  I hope this is not the future of Blu-ray packaging. The pretty pictures printed on the book aren't that important; the safekeeping of the discs is.

0739341243|4.0|I enjoyed this well-written book but found there to be one glaring oversight, at least in my opinion on the subject of introversion.  This book had me thinking more than once, \\"maybe I'm not an introvert\\".  Of course, I am.  And that was the main problem I had with this book.  Does preferring a \\"quiet walk in the woods\\" to listening to a blaring television spew the same commercial 10 times in one hour mean that I don't like to be stimulated?  To me, there is nothing stimulating at all about blaring the prime time line up or listening to someone go on (again) about that time he blah, blah, blah, blah.  And my quiet, un-stimulated walk in the woods is anything but.  What I experience is a symphony of soundscapes created by nature that are coming in every direction and never sound the same way twice.  While my extrovert walking buddy is bored stiff.  Different strokes for different folks.  Saying introverts avoid over stimulation is misleading.  As an introvert, I can honestly say that most extroverts I know would not be able to handle the inward stimulation that I prefer as much as I would avoid the outward stimulation they prefer.

B004ZNB12O|1.0|First, I agree with other reviewers who state a true best of PF would have to be a multi-disc set...

B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I was a little dismayed when I saw the rating for app. After reading the reviews, it seems like non-Fire users were having the most problems. The app seems to work fine on my Fire. I think it is a good app for what I use it for, looking up contacts.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|There were a lot of things that felt like they were kept secret on purpose before sitting down and viewing The Grey for the first time. The trailer hints at the movie being nothing more than a survival thriller starring Liam Neeson as he struggles to survive not only the unrelenting cold elements, but also the ferocious wolves that inhabit his surroundings. The Grey is written and directed by Joe Carnahan, the man who brought us Smokin' Aces and The A-Team. The movie is also produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, which you think the marketing campaign would jump all over but doesn't even mention. Not only that, but there is quite a bit more to the movie than the trailer and TV spots let on.<br /><br />As the movie begins, Ottway (Liam Neeson) narrates a letter he's writing to his wife. This segment just made me realize what my life is lacking most right now and that's a Liam Neeson voiceover for every thought that crosses my mind. Think about that. It'd be the most amazing thing ever. The trailer reveals a few major things: that Ottway is stranded in the middle of nowhere in the blistering cold thanks to a plane crash and that wolves stand in the way of him actually surviving this ordeal. The plane crash itself is one of the best executed in recent memory. The way it's filmed and edited is downright ruthless. It's as if you're on the plane as it goes down. The Grey doesn't just place you in this blizzard-ridden hell infested with wolves, it kicks your teeth down your throat, laughs in your face, and throws you into it with everything it has.<br /><br />The movie gives new meaning to some of the simplest things. Seeing your breath in cold weather takes on an entirely new definition and the way The Grey deals with death just feels incredibly powerful. Ottway questions faith right from the start and takes matters into his own hands throughout the movie. The events that transpire take a toll on even the most religious plane crash survivors. Death is more of a relief than something worth distancing yourself from. Ottway describes it as being a warm sensation and thinking about the thing you love most in life before completely giving yourself into it. Many of the campfire conversations are entirely more impactful than they have any right to be. The conversation about faith in general hits you like a potato sack full of cinder blocks.<br /><br />The Grey manages to shout its message even when there's nothing being said on-screen. One of the images that stuck with me long after the movie ended was the shot of blood flowing into the paw print of a wolf in the snow. There's a scene by the river that strictly relies on sound and the way you succumb to it is nothing more than brilliant. There's another shot at the end of the film where (and I'm trying to avoid spoilers the best I can) Ottway is arranging some objects in the snow. The way Liam Neeson's fat, sausage-like fingers delicately wrap themselves around these objects and the way his hands tremble as he does this illustrates not only what this man has been through, but also that he's at the end of his rope. Plus the movie will make you want to look over your shoulder the next time you consider relieving yourself out in nature somewhere.<br /><br />That level of greatness The Grey eventually achieves isn't around at all times. Some lame dialogue does squeak through and characters manage to do really stupid things at times (John Diaz, played by Frank Grillo, especially), but that seems to help the movie more than anything. People, real people, occasionally do stupid things especially when they're scared. So this kind of made the characters feel more genuine and made it very clear that certain characters were caving under pressure.<br /><br />There was a movie that came out back in 2000 that was called Vertical Limit. It was one of my most trying times at the movie theater. I fought vehemently to leave about halfway through because I hated it so much, but I was with people at the time whowanted to stay until the end. It was probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had to pay for. The Grey is basically everything I wanted that movie to be. The cast is fantastic, their actions are mostly believable, and there's this meaning to everything that really speaks to you.<br /><br />The Grey is a grainy thriller that knocks the wind out of you on more than one occasion. In fact, it's rare that the movie actually allows you to catch your breath. Everything is such a raw, vicious, and brutal test of faith. It's fantastically violent and Liam Neeson is superb. If The Grey is anything to fall back on, then 2012 is going to be one hell of a year for movies.of the worst experiences I've ever had to pay for.

0062082353|5.0|I have had the pleasure to read and review numerous books on the U.S. NAVY SEALS and this one is one of the very best I have ever read on the training of a Navy SEAL Sniper.  This book compares to the book THE LONE SURVIVAL by another Navy SEAL.  If you are interested in learning the truth about what it takes to be a U.S. NAVY SEAL Sniper, this is a must read book.  The most amazing thing is that this is a true and real life experience of what war is all about and the role the SEALs play in the field.  All I can say is that it is a fantastic read.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale( Author: Predator Hunter: A Warrior's Memoir)

B005L38QK2|4.0|You will almost certainly, as other reviewers have noted, end up disabling the buttons on the side of this mouse.  Inevitably you will hit them when you don't intend to, resulting in entirely unintended effects in different games and applications.  While I have not (yet) played Diablo III, I absolutely intend to upon its release, and look forward to using those same buttons for quick and easy access to potions -- until then, they're simply (for me, and apparently for others) sort of a poorly placed inconvenience.<br /><br />That aside, there's not much to dislike about this mouse.  It's well designed, comfortable in the hand, the same rubberized feel you're going to get with a lot of higher end mice, with a low profile and lighter (nimbler) feel in the hand.  It is as precise and clean in wheel and button function as any normal gamer might require.  Casual users may find the lights a little more garish than they'd prefer in a non-gaming environment, but the aesthetics stop well short of being distracting or intrusive.<br /><br />This is, all around, a great mouse even if one doesn't intend to tether themselves to Diablo 3 long-term upon its release.  It offers many of the features and feel of more expensive options while providing an extra edge to that particular game.  The software is easy to work with, those side buttons easy to disable (rendering any complaint I might have about them nearly moot) -- I'm simply (quite) happy with the mouse and the value it represents.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is great.  I play this game a lot, when I have nothing to do, or am just bored.  I would recommend this game to all my freinds.
030788743X|5.0|In 2044, the real world is pretty awful. Poverty, hunger, and unemployment are even bigger issues than they are today. The only shining, wonderful part of life is called OASIS, a free virtual reality massive multiplayer online game that replaces many aspects of real life: shopping, games, vacations, communication, leisure time, and even school. One of the creators of this innovative technology  died a few years ago and willed his entire enormous fortune to the person that can find three keys and the hidden easter egg in the vast OASIS. After five years, no on has found anything until Wade Watts find the copper key. Wade, in real life and in the game, is poor and looked down upon. In real life, he lives in one of the treacherous towers of mobile homes with his abusive aunt and whatever boyfriend she has at the time. In game, he doesn't have enough credits to travel and he's stuck with a few low level items and the default avatar skin. Suddenly, the whole world is looking at him, including the  IOI cooperation bent on finding the easter egg to make the OASIS cost money and saturate it with ads, effectively destroying it for much of the population. Can Wade find the easter egg before IOI? How far is IOI willing to go to get it?  I read Ready Player One because a few people recommended it to me and they had a cool booth at San Diego Comic Con. I expected a cool, nerdy story that I would enjoy, but it went above and beyond my expectations. I read it in only a couple of days and I felt glued to the book, needing to know what would happen next. The first thing that really impressed me was the OASIS and its huge impact on the world. The possibilities are infinite in that world. You can be whoever you want to be ad experience it as if it were real life. Even in school, no one will ever really know who you really are unless you let them know. All of that life is experienced through screen names and avatars. There are thousands of planets that depict anything from schools to worlds from sci-fi films to night clubs. To the people of the time, it's better than reality and a way to escape. The huge differences between the virtual and real world were interesting to witness. In the OASIS, there are infinite possibilities and hope. In the real world, one can be enslaved in never ending indentured servitude for unpaid credit cards or live in a precarious tower of mobile homes.  The characters were all dynamic and develop throughout the novel. Wade is the quintessential underdog on a quest that is seen time and time again in science fiction and fantasy stories. He used the OASIS for school and to escape his horrible life full of abuse, pov I, and I'm sure many people, related to him because of his outsider status and nerdiness. His knowledge about James Halliday and his various obsessions was vast. The narrative was peppered with references from science fiction and the 80's in any media imaginable. Although I didn't get every single one, they gave the story an added depth. Wade used his obsession with everything related to Halliday and his intelligence to get through not only the obstacles in the game, but the ones in real life as well. His circle of friends were also endearing. All of his friends only knew him online, but he developed real, lasting relationships. It was interesting to see who they were in real life, behind their avatar facades.  I absolutely loved Ready Player One. I didn't want to put it down and I always went right back to reading the first opportunity I could. If you like science fiction, the 80's, and fun adventure stories, this book is definitely for you.
B005J6LKVI|4.0|I just upgraded to a blu ray player and wanted to start collecting some blu ray disks.  I had not seen this movie but enjoyed the book so I ordered it for my collection.  The quality is amazing and love the extras.  The casting and acting is perfect.
1609611543|4.0|I ended up buying Wheat Belly on the day before my 30th birthday.  I was disgusted with myself and my weight in particular.  I went to the book store seeking a book on emotional eating, but they did not have the book I was looking for.  I saw Wheat Belly on the shelf and immediately thought to myself that it was another gimmick and figured I'd open it up to see what the new \\"diet of the month\\" was going to be.  Once I started reading though, I was hooked.  What Dr. Davis presents in his book is some very scary information.  I stopped eating wheat that same day and I haven't looked back.  I do feel better, so much so that I was able to get off of anti-depressants.  I also have clear skin for the first time ever (I never had severe acne, but always had a pimple here and there).  It has been 2 1/2 months off of wheat and I don't ever want to go back to my old diet again.  That said, for me at least, wheat was only the tip of the iceberg.  I did not lose any weight by eliminating wheat alone, which was a huge disappointment, especially after reading the Wheat Belly Blog success stories.  I have a lot of weight to lose, too (I started out at 5'6\\" and 190).  So, while I think Dr. Davis's book is full of important and necessary information, I think it sets a lot of people up for disappointment because after reading it you think \\"Ah ha!  I have the key!  Now all I have to do is avoid wheat and my weight problems will be a think of the past!\\"  Not quite.  I've gone on to eliminate all grains and legumes (so peanuts, beans, hummus, etc.), avoiding dairy as much as possible, and using only good fats.  It was not as simple as eliminating wheat and then suddenly finding good health.  I think this book is a good starting point for anyone serious about getting healthy.  It was through this book and the Wheat Belly Blog that I found Mark's Daily Apple and The Primal Blueprint.  From there I found Primal Body, Primal Mind.  It's by incorporating the advice from all of these sourcesthat now I'm making real progress.  I want nothing more to be in a 2 piece swimsuit on my 31st birthday and I think that, for the first time in my entire life, I have a plan in place that will really get me that and I can stick with for the long term.  So, I definitely thank Dr. Davis for that.  Just as an FYI, I have been overweight my entire life with the exception of a few months here or there.  I lost a significant amount of weight for my wedding (55 pounds), but was completely miserable in the process.  This time I'm not miserable, and that ia a huge differece.

1451627289|5.0|First let me say that this is a very LONG book.  Thank goodness I got the Kindle version or I'd probably need assistance carrying it around.  However, if you are a Reader and looking for a compelling book that pulls you in and takes you along on the ride, this is the book.  This is King doing what he does so very well:  storytelling.  That's at the heart of every really great book and yet too often neglected by many authors.  King has long ago mastered it.  His books have the pacing and rhythm that keep you turning pages, and 11/22/63 is one of his finest.  It's not just about the Kennedy Assassination, and you don't have to be particularly interested in that event to enjoy this book.  Because what it really does is ask you to speculate along with King about what might happen if you had the ability to change history, both the major and very minor events.  Is it possible at all, and if you could what else might change?  Would those changes really be for the better, or would they be for the worse?  And is it the major events that really shape us, or is it the every day stuff that we pay little heed to?  This book asks you to speculate \\"what if.\\"  These are the questions that the hero of 11/22/63, Jake Epping, faces.  Epping is a very real, quite average guy that most people can identify with, and the reader grapples with the questions, and the adventures, right along with him.  He's trying to do the right thing, if he can figure out what that is and if history will let him.

B005V2EVBQ|1.0|After watching a video for this product and being fairly abusive on electronics I felt this case would be the most protective. The cover is flimsy because it is meant to fold if used as a stand. If there is a front impact I would not trust it to protect the screen. When used as a stand the cover easily slips out of the slot. I bought the leather case and found it to be much sturdier and more protective...for the same price.
0375701427|5.0|This was my first Philip Roth book and I was quite impressed.  The three sport star athlete turned successful businessman reminded me so much of my Dad (same age).  Just move the NJ setting to pastoral Indiana.  I thought the reunion scene was quite good.  It was a very well told tale and in my view deserved the Pulitzer Prize.  I think my only \\"difficulty\\" with the book was the extreme nature of the daughter.  I didn't quite get her total downfall.  But all in all a great tale of a time in America, family, business, the decay of our cities etc.  Roth is a fine writer.  I followed up this book with The Human Stain and The Dying Animal.  Enjoyed both very much.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is another in the stable of the people who did fireproof and facing the giants, and I have to say that this might be there best one yet. It offers a believable tale and a God-center response. To me, this made it a little bit more real world than the other two movies. All of them were good, but this one just seems more authentic than the others. Plus, by this installation the acting is much, much stronger than in the previous movies as well.  The script it really great and their call to act as real men of God is much more moving (to me) than some of the other messages. All in all, anyone could profit from watching this movie. Get it and be enlightened.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|This movie has it all! Originality, excitement, character development some violence and a great soundtrack. I would strongly recommend to adults only and I have not seen a better movie out in 2011!
0439023521|4.0|This book struck me as being very similar to Battle Royale.  Both stories have teenage kids fighting in an arena until only 1 is left.  Of course, the selection process and even the staging of the fights are different, but in many ways the principal emotional hooks are frighteningly similar.  But to start with the good aspects.  Hunger games does have an engaging if naive heroine who presents a hardened emotional song to the world.  She's draw as being from the lowest of the low, a poor fatherless girl who's been doing what she can to keep her family alive.  The story looks over her shoulder and into her mind as she is driven into the contest and then strives to survive.  The emotions in this area are often raw and gritty, making the story quite fun to read.  For that, I can give the story 4 stars.  *** warning spoilers ahead*  Unfortunately, this story is not Battle Royale.  The emotional hooks of this story actually didn't grip me very tightly.  Part of this was the main character, who is both too naive nad too detacted to make me believe she was in the games themselves.  Then Suzaane Collins  tried to avoid making the fights in the games real.  Of the 22 characters that die in the games, 4 are actually killed on the page and with a weapon.  2 more die of insect stings (admittedly after the heroine unleashes a hive of wasps),  1 dies from eating poisonous berrys (that the heroine's friend gathered.).  The rest are merely reported as dead by the game controllers.  And much like Battle Royale, this game ends up with 2 survivors.  But the difference was that in Battle Royale, they escape.  In Hunger Games, the game controllers first tell them that they can win together, then try to rescind the deal and then reinstate it when the duo threatens to perform the final act of Romeo and Juliet on live TV  (well, both eating poisonous berries, rather than using a knife, but same concept.)  I know this is the first book of the trilogy, and knew that before reading, but unlikeBattle Royale which had a sequel because the first book was solid, Hunger Games was written with the sequel planned, and the marks of this are spread throughout the later pages of this book.  The story lost a lot of its magic for me.  This is a good book, and I can see why many people rate it highly.  I had the fortune to have read the much stronger Battle Royale first, and could see flaws in this story that will have me avoiding book 2 and 3 for the moment.  it's hard to make a story like this carry through a trilogy and the fact that Suzanne Collins not only did, but twisted her writing to leave the hanging plot threads makes this book one I recommend cautiously.  It's good, but for many, its not going to be the best choice for an afternoon read.

B002GHIPYI|1.0|Well I purchased these headphones, once again going based off what everyone was saying, to find it looks like most people on Amazon again are not in the realm of my tastes in sound.  These are nice headphones in terms of sound fidelity, I can hear all the details of most of my music (sourced from FLAC on a Sansa clip) quite well over my previous, non-professional headphones, except there's one serious drawback: the mids are not there. They're just non-existent. It's similar to a pair of Sony V6 Studio headphones I tried that sounded the same exact way. There's highs and bass pretty much exclusively and it gives them a very filtered sort of sound.  Now on the matter of the highs, they're ridiculous. These headphones are to highs what a lot of those Beats by Dr. Dre sort of headphones are to bass, they boost them so extravagantly that it is seriously uncomfortable to listen to at an enjoyable volume. They're shrill and just not realistic, which is really stupid considering these are supposed to be monitor headphones. That paired with the lack of mids is enough for me to give these headphones a 1 star review. I have absolutely no interest in promoting headphones that assault my eardrums.  Those things aside, they're comfortable and seem well built, but it's not like any of that matters if the sound isn't good.

B003XM70B4|5.0|ahh the Goonies, this movie came out in '85. One year after Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, now you may ask why that's so important, because steven spielberg thought that Temple of Doom was too violent. And asked that ratings board to come up with a rating between PG and R, thus PG-13 was born. Goonies is PG, I won't go through the plot since that's been done a thousand times. This was one of my favorite movies growing up as a child, and now that I'm married with a child on the way. I hope this movie becomes one of her favorites, who didn't dream of finding a pirate treasure map, following it. Going through all those traps, and finding the ship at the end, with all that gold. Priceless, considering it's directed by the same man who directed Superman The movie. Dick Donner himself, I would give this movie more stars if i could. Would I sit my two year old, or three old in front of it, no. But i would sit my seven year old in front of it. This is the perfect movie to watch on a rainy day, it gets the imagination going. I can say nothing but good things about this movie. Plus Lyle Alzado is in it as Sloth.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This was and is a great movie. Seller delivered quick. I was impressed.The movie itself is unreal these movies never get old they just get better.
0312576463|4.0|The fact that I read almost 600 pages of small print in about a week, even though I only had two days off for Christmas, tells me that I found this novel to be very entertaining and engrossing. The first chapter had me hooked. It was so well-written, I would call it virtuosic. However, I feel that the rest of the book, although very well-written from cover to cover, doesn't quite maintain the level of excellence of the first chapter. This novel isn't the equal of a Middlemarch, although that's what it seems to be striving for. Middlemarch strikes the perfect balance between engrossing soap opera and consciousness-raising social commentary, whereas Frantzen adds a little too much soap opera to the recipe. Also, there's a subdued but persistent undercurrent of misanthropy running throughout the novel that turns me off, even as it strikes a deep chord within me. I know all too well that it's difficult for intellectuals who care about the world and the environment to avoid a smug, patronizing, contemptuous attitude towards people who may be poorly educated and misguided in their opinions and habits, but it seems to me that some of our greatest writers (Saramago and Welty are just a couple of examples) transcend that attitude and are able to write with deep empathy, humanism, and compassion about ignorant, misguided, selfish, or peasant-like people. But I'm sure that if I suddenly gained Frantzen's writing talent due to some freak gamma ray accident, my own novels would betray the same kind of misanthropy. I do find it amusing that Walter's politics are pretty much exactly like mine, and some of his speeches about overpopulation and economic growth remind me almost uncannily of rants I've delivered to friends and acquaintances. I wonder how much Walter serves as a mouthpiece for Frantzen's own opinions or if he's poking fun at Walter's politics as much as he is at Walter's personality and social skills. One last minor gripe: I find the descriptions of music and its milieu slightly off (major and minor power chords?). I think maybe Frantzen is too detailed in those sections for his own good, or maybe it's my own views about music that are slightly off. But these are minor reservations that didn't impede my enjoyment of this rich, ambitious, and entertaining novel.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I was really happy when I received this. It looks and feels better than I had expected. It makes the Fire a lot easier to hold (it's kind of awkward to hold by itself) and seems to ofter good protection against accidental damage. Overall very pleased and would buy again.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love this case. It is light and easy to use, yet protective. Glad I bought it. I like that I was able to pick a color other than black. The design for the front flap to be bendable and used to make a stand for the kindle is nice when you need to take a brake.

B0059XTUVI|1.0|I have no doubt that Meryl Streep plays an excellent Thatcher; but I think that many people outside Britain don't realise how Margaret Thatcher was hated by many in her own country, for her presiding over the decline of British industry, for her closure of the coal mines and selling off natural resources such as Oil; for her privatisation of essential services; for her attempted introduction of the Poll Tax; for her referring to trade unions as \\"the enemy within\\"; for her warmongering in order to win votes (Falklands, Gulf War), and selling off social housing without replacing it by building more houses thus driving the low-paid into the arms of private landlords, or even homelessness. I haven't seen it yet, but I hope this comes over in the film. Oh! and don't forget that finally she was regarded as a liability BY HER OWN CONSERVATIVE PARTY  and was replaced as leader and thus Prime Minister. Enjoy the acting, but never forget the lasting damage she did to our once \\"Great\\" Britain.

B005LL4U54|5.0|I, too, was struck by the poignant and gorgeous music of the classic movie Vertigo when watching The Artist.  As I walked out of the movie, I mentioned that I loved the movie and the beautiful, stirring music from Vertigo.  No one except me recognized it but I, like the previous reviewer, have an ear for music, more specifically movie soundtracks.

B0034G4OWM|4.0|Just a fun movie... Brendan Fraser is a Family Fun silly Jerry Lewis type - (and very cute, which doesn't hurt!) check out the George in the Jungle movies too if you find this movie amusing.  As for the reviewer about the \\"danger\\" the animals cause - \\"OH Come on!!\\"  I am an avid animal lover - and as \\"real\\" animals could never do these things (we hope!!!) this is just FUN!!  Great for family nights!  And, to boot, the movie has a message about saving our open spaces and the animals within them.  Awesome.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|When I heard that Michele Williams won a Golden Globe award for her performance in \\"A Week With Marilyn\\", I really wanted to see this movie.  The critics were right.  It was an outstanding performance.  I am old enough to remember the \\"real\\" Marilyn Monroe\\" and I must say that I felt that she really morphed the beauty and the sad essence of that tragic film star.<br /><br />As far as the rest of the film went, however, I was less impressed.  Yes, the acting was good.  And yes, the story of the smitten young Englishman who worked on the set of \\"the Prince and the Showgirl\\" was heartwarming in his desire and his adoration.  And the theme of the film brought back a time and a place in history that has come and gone but is nice to remember.<br /><br />However, once the concept of this movie was introduced, it got a little boring and there were really no surprises.  And, I must admit, that I actually fell asleep.<br /><br />\\"My Week With Marilyn\\" is not a perfect film.  However, it is well worth seeing.

B005LAIGN2|4.0|I've long thought that that an updated telling of the Red Tails needed to be told, and I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for months...tonight I finally had the chance.<br /><br />Perhaps I may have built up my expectations too much with the trailers, personal expectations, etc., but all in all the best I can say is that I liked, not loved it.<br /><br />Some of my favorite movies are war movies, e.g., Battle of Britain, Fly Boys, Battle of the Bulge, Twelve O-Clock High, The Longest Day, etc., so I'm always on the lookout for a new good war movie that's based on a great true story.<br /><br />\\"Red Tails\\" had the potential to zoom into the best war movies ever made, but somehow the buttons that I thought would and needed to be pushed were pushed only lightly and infrequently.  There was not enough background of the challenges faced by African American fliers in the military in the 1940s, there was not enough of the drudgery of the non-essential(?) missions they flew after they arrived in Italy, not enough of the struggles they had to go through to fly combat missions, and, frankly, there were not enough sequences of aerial combat - the real Red Tails flew a TON of missions.  I thought that the side stories, for example of the off-base personal lives of some of the fliers was in a way distracting from the main story (a la Ben Affleck's romance in \\"Pearl Harbor\\").  It did provide an interesting glimpse into the different way that Italians and Americans viewed African-Americans in those days, and while that was interesting, it was not central enough in my opinion to devote so much of the movie to it.<br /><br />I guess the reason that the overall experience seemed a bit, um, lacking to me is that I constantly felt like I was joining a conversation already in progress or an event already in progress, and that I was not presented the whole story.  Fortunately I already knew something about the Red Tails, so I was able to catch up and make sense of everything, but if someone was just strolling into a theater to watch the movie, they could have been lost in terms of the big picture.<br /><br />All in all I'd have to say that I'd give the movie \\"Red Tails\\" somewhere between a 6 and an 8 out of 10.  I even debated with myself over whether I thought it was \\"OK\\" or \\"I liked it.\\"  \\"I loved it\\" was not one of the options I was considering.<br /><br />I salute the original Red Tails for their service and sacrifice, and George Lucas for producing this story that needed to be told.  I just wish that the film had more umph in the telling.<br /><br />I debated between 3 and 4 stars, but opted for 4 because the story is worthy.a theater to watch the movie, they could have been lost in terms of the big picture.

B0041KKYEM|4.0|The greatness of Black Swan lies in its power to evoke. This review is sort of about all the other reviews. Like a flawed gemstone, what you see depends upon what facet you look at. Reviews that love Black Swan or hate it show the reviewers often going through a process of struggle to come to grips with Black Swan and express their judgments. Director Darren Aronofsky drives a stiletto into your mind with his vast store of cinematic tricks; your reaction may be negative. Deciding what is reality puts your mind in an uproar. Because of the constant close camera work on Natalie Portman, I felt the film was emotionally grueling while visually enthralling. The ending is a head-spinner. How well you can tolerate ambiguity, disturbing images, multiple themes, and so on, will determine whether you like it or not. Overall, I thought Black Swan was a difficult, but compelling experience.<br /><br />The film rests mainly on the phenomenal artistic control displayed by Natalie Portman. Her gradual slide from White Swan to Black is a tremendous acting achievement. Her physical effort in the role of Nina is reminiscent of Robert DeNiro's \\"Raging Bull\\". Her performance draws strength from a superb supporting cast headed by Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder, and Mila Kunis. Others have discussed technical aspects of Black Swan better than I can.<br /><br />Before I say what I think Black Swan is about, let me say that Black Swan operates on many levels at once. You can say it's art house porn and be correct, and say it is a meditation on the pursuit of perfection and also be correct. Here the film's ambiguity wraps itself around you and starts to squeeze.<br /><br /> Black Swan is encoded with all sorts of symbols and images (particularly mirrors) you may pick up on. Some are blatantly, crudely obvious, like the winged tattoo on rival Lily's back (Mila Kunis). Others, like the rave scene in the nightclub, are not apparent unless you stop-frame the sequence and see justwhat is spilling out of Nina's psyche. Things Lily says to Nina are often prophetic.<br /><br />The opening dance/dream sequence defines Nina's baseline mental state: virginal innocence that flees from sexuality by transforming into a safe, pure White Swan. Compare that sequence with dance director Thomas' (Vincent Cassel) sexually harassing Nina later on to get Nina to express passion in her dancing, and you get a sense that there is a lot of sophisticated overlapping going on between Nina's mental state and the Swan Lake storyline.<br /><br />When Nina finishes performing the Black Swan coda in the film's finale, we see two enormous winged shadows behind her as she basks in triumph before a wild audience. This suggests maybe she has reached some sort of spiritual equilibrium between her light and dark side while also being totally insane. Other clues are in her name: 'Nina\\" means 'little girl' in Spanish, as other reviewers have noted. Also, 'Nina' could be a nod to prima ballerina Nina Ananiashvili, as perfect a ballerina as there ever was. When Nina goes to work, in the film's beginning, she is wrapped in feathery, downy neck warmers. The film is rich with possible clues to completing the Nina puzzle.<br /><br />Okay, so what is Black Swan really about? It's about a 'chick' desperately trying to break out of her shell so she can flap her wings and leave her mother's nest. Remember, Black Swan is a flawed gem. Turn it another way you will see something else.

B002W1UEW4|3.0|I get frustrated when people bash this movie. It's by no means great, but let's be honest, you don't exactly look to G.I. Joe for highbrow, thought provoking social discourse. You watch it because it's fun. This is an enjoyable action/adventure movie. The acting is okay, but it's got a lot of explosions and action sequences so sit back and watch. Turn the brain off for an evening and just enjoy the show.

B000I3PERS|3.0|I've always been a little torn about Braveheart. There are aspects of it that are thrilling such as the action sequences while others that drive me a bit crazy, the diminutive role of Robert Bruce for example. It's certainly a movie worth watching, if only for the battle scenes, but it also has some deep flaws. The acting is spotty and the history that the movie is based on is generally skewed, if not completely wrong. The movie is also long, and perhaps worse, it at times feels long.  It's a movie that's best watched once with a lengthy pause before a second viewing.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|C'mon...is there someone out there who hasn't heard of Stephen King? Do you not know how or what he writes? If you don't like Stephen King's work, don't buy this book. If you enjoy his work, or if you enjoy the work of Dean Koontz even, this book is fantastic. This is King at his best. I read a review that mentioned this work is \\"mature\\" and that's a great word for it.<br /><br />And the ending is great. King mentions in his acknowlegements that his son (amazing writer Joe Hill) gave him a new ending. I'm dying to get the inside scoop on that. Anyway, you don't need this review to convince you to read this or not to read this, but I stil thought I should post it. I loved every minute that I was reading this book!
B006SV2LWA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The acting is superb, as is the cinematography. The story is nuanced and excellent. What I like most about this movie is that it makes you think. You are forced to lean forward a bit and wonder how realistic is the story. Could this sort of disaster actually happen? I couldn't help but think of [[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]] at times. Not because there are Zombie (there are no zombies, just to be clear), but because of the institutional and human response to such a biological disaster.
B005JABSB6|3.0|These 2nd gen glasses from Sharp are lighter, and flimsier, than the previous model. They are a bit more comfortable (as far as these things can be). They work as well as the old ones for 3D viewing.<br />The USB rechargeable battery is nice, but only seems to run about 2 hours. Half way through Avatar a message pops up saying one hour of charge left.<br />The option to switch between 2D and 3D enables one viewer to chose to opt out of 3D viewing.. which is odd but might be something some one wants.<br />You'd still need to keep wearing the glasses of course. At 75$ they don't really seem to have the quality you'd expect, and with the weak battery capacity I'm only giving them a 3 star.
0553579908|4.0|A Clash of Kings picks up where a Game of Thrones left off. If you really enjoyed the first book in the series, then you should by all means continue to the second. If you did not enjoy the first one, you shouldn't expect the second to be any different.  Okay, that being said, Martin begins to create the framework for where he wants the rest of the series to go in A Clash of Kings. There is plenty of action, but there is also a lot of important plot development that will eventually pay off (if not in this book then in one of the later ones).
B000JMKOI2|3.0|Don't expect any timeless wisdom in this one, yet you might be surprised about what you do find.<br /><br />Main character Chianski is a young rebel and introvert(perhaps early 20's) as the story begins. We follow him through a journey in which he remains on the same destructive path time and time again. He doesn't give a damn about anyone, including himself. Only a searching reader could assert that he offers much if any introspection on his path through minimum wage, alcoholic, urban America.<br /><br />We must then try to see what we can gain from his tale. Chianski is deeply bitten by the bug of nihilism and thus only aspires to be a sometimes clever man in a world of American misfits. Tale after tale brings us no new insight nor growth that we might expect of a reasonable man. Chianski will, however, give us some worthy perspectives to chew on as an anti-authority detached observer of systems. Ultimately, the tone is powerful and distinct, giving us a strong modern novel that will leave it's own mark.
B006R6ZP6U|4.0|Brothers Grimm is first and foremost an enjoyable film with an exciting story and decent, if not spectacular, special effects.  This movie often gets mixed reviews. Mixed because people who love Terry Gilliam's other work find this movie to be too commercial while others expect a more coherent film, this, of course is neither. It is best viewed as an introduction to Gilliam, or perhaps a litmus test. The Brothers Grimm features the Gilliam hallmark of a battle between rationality and irrationality. For people who have enjoyed Gilliam's other work, this should be no surprise.  Unlike Gilliam's other stories, Gilliam does not weave the battle into the narrative. This is a linear plot line, meaning that things happen one after another (the same cannot be said for Gilliam's other movies). But despite the linear story telling, Gilliam does not abandon the sense of whimsy and fantasy that defines so much of his work.  If you are unfamiliar with Gilliam's work, this is a good place to start. It will help you understand the more complex discourses that he engages in his other films. If you are a fan of Gilliam, then this is a milder version of the Gilliam films we have all come to know and love. But that's okay because this is still a very good movie.

0201633612|5.0|As others have already noted, this is a seminal work on design patterns and is considered by many software professionals as a must read. It is probably a bit too complex for novices to design patterns in which case they are better off using another resource for starters (e.g.: Head First Design Patterns) and then eventually move on to this book. Head First design patterns was obviously easier to read and understand since the examples are more up to date and material is not as thorough as this book. It took me more than a month and half to read this book carefully from cover to cover. Although a lot of the patterns are discussed in depth from a theoretical level including evaluating trade-offs made with specific implementation choices, the examples in SmallTalk are out of date and not that relevant anymore but that's understandable given the publish date of this book (1994). Like some other books (e.g.: Java Concurrency in Practice), multiple readings are necessary to fully digest the material and that needs to be coupled with either independent practice of the specific implementation choices and/or other resources that have more examples of pattern implementations so as to not only reinforce understanding but also lay a solid foundation for Object Oriented Design. Most senior folks working with Object Oriented Systems typically have this book at their desk as a reference. I found one particular pattern, namely Interpreter, pretty difficult to follow. Other than that the rest of the material is readable. Having some familiarity with UML notation will help but the appendix includes explanation of the notation used in the book, so it is not a stopper if you don't have any exposure in that area. Towards the end of each chapter covering a given pattern, the authors include a section on related patterns which can be extremely helpful. This book also organizes different patterns into creational, structural and behavioral categories and also identifies which ones within a given category can supplement each other and which ones compete against each other. This book is not meant to be a comprehensive resource on design patterns and will have to be supplemented by other books. Highly recommended for anyone working with Object Oriented Systems.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|ANYONE who rated this 1 star obviously did not even buy star wars the complete saga on blu ray. All they needed was a place to vent before the product was actually released. In my opinion you should not even be able to write a review unless you have actually owned the product. Thats just my humble opinion. So for those of you who are \\"hating\\" on the complete saga, go elsewhere, please. I've grown up on star wars just like many of you. (owned the VHS, saw the original trilogies when re-released in theaters, got the dvds, saw the prequel trilogy as they came out in theaters, owned the dvds, FINALLY got each trilogy pack when released as well with the unaltered original prequel movies) NOT to mention countless star wars merchandise (bed sheets, toys, drinking glasses, etc.) SO don't act like you are the only star wars fan in the world. There are many of us.  OK MOVING ON, i got this as a gift for christmas, but have not been able to watch it because i was finishing up the LOTR extended blu ray which is one of the best as well. The best thing is that you can be halfway through episode 1 and realize the brightness of the colors, the fixing of some CGI, and the INTENSE score and soundtrack that sounds amazing on blu ray, surround sound (volume WAY up), and tell me you don't regret your decision to own this! (Too bad they didn't take Jar-Jar out, i would not miss him.)  All in all, just watch through the movies, it will be like watching the movies for the first time again. Which is why we all love star wars in the first place, to feel that nostalgia of a timeless story.  There is nothing i can say about picture quality and sound quality that has not been already said, but WOW.  If you are thinking of buying but need that foot out the door, let me stand behind you and push you out!  If you are a fan of star wars, do you really need to think twice about buying this?  AND TO ALL THE COMPLAINERS: Have fun waiting 6 years for the next blu ray boxed set after Lucas re-releases (again) each movie in 3D. (If you have not heard, Lucas plans to release one movie each year. Do the math.) I can also laugh at you now because most of you who stand your ground and refuse to watch...GOOD. You really do not know what you are missing. And the rest are GOING to cave in and buy it anyways then shamefully admit that its actually good. I promise you that. HAHA.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I purchased this cover (for the eye appeal) after my daughter gave me the kindle fire for Christmas. After reading the reviews I had convinced myself this cover wasn't for me. Once it arrived, I placed the kindle into the case as the manufacturer specified. I had no problem with the front cover not closing as was stated in the reviews I had read. I did notice it was a bit stiff when I first installed the unit into the case, but after a day or two the material relaxed and was perfect.  I would absolutely recommend this cover to others. I have received so many compliments on this cover and have been told by kindle owners they were going to give up their previously purchased cover and buy the Verso Prologue case. You wont be disappointed!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good time consumer but some games are dumb well.. most are. which is probably why I play it. idk but yea recommend. its free what u got to lose but gigabytes!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is hard at first, but once you get a knack for it, you will have as much fun as you can handle!
B0063IH60K|5.0|not many frills, but a great basic game. I really enjoy the winning deal feature. a great time waster in class.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a better version of solitaire than one I paid .99 for. The game has a few options making it easy or hard depending on what you are in the mood for.
0307887960|5.0|I did the initial attack phase for 2.5 days, then went crazy on cookies, cake and chips at a party... then went right back on going straight to the next phase where you add in vegetables every other day -only i modified (sorry Doctor) this by eating vegetables for lunch every day and only protein for dinner (you wake up less bloated and avoid weight gain due to bloating if you don't eat so many veggies at dinner). Amazingly, I have lost 6 lbs. I have 4 more lbs. to go and feel totally confident it will all be gone within another week. Easy diet to follow and hunger is not an issue. The only thing is you need to get a little creative with your protein recipes or you get very bored fast and you have to have all your protein available in your house . So even though I cheated big time once, this diet has been extremely effective.<br /><br />Update: If you hit a plateau what worked for me was going back to the attack phase and adding no salt at all to my food, making sure to drink at least 6 cups of water and 3 cups of green teas. Lost 3 lbs in a day.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Larsson's second book in the Blomkvist/Salander saga is of a completely different flavor than the first, but equally suspenseful and exciting. This book delves into the main characters' lives, histories, and relationships more than the first. I enjoyed it but not as much the first. It does end on a cliff-hanger so be prepared to buy the third as soon as you finish this one!
B003BYYDXW|5.0|I am not a teenie bopper who's in love with Justin. I'm 30 years old and I'm a vocal and stage presence coach for children in my local area. I enjoy Justin Bieber's music. It's fun to workout to and catchy. I would recommend all his albums if you need some feel good music. Justin is a great person and deserves everything that he's been given in life.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Hard to beat these.  They are well built, cool excellently, and do not cost a fortune.  I have paid a lot more for a lot less cooler 10 years ago.  I'm very happy to see these on the market.  I believe they at the very least provide a good, inexpensive reference point for comparing other coolers.  Great stuff!  Right now I have one on my desktop computer cooling a Core i5 2500k.  I may grab one of these for my server, too, just for the quietness.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|worth the download. hours and hours of games. 9 out of 10. thanks for such a great free app. keep them coming

B0013K1ALE|5.0|This was bought for my fiance, for christmas, and he loved it!!! Other then my brother-in-law my fiance is the biggest Led Zeppelin fan i know and he absolutely loved this!!!
0802130208|2.0|Caveat: I only made it 5 hours into the book before predictability and repetition wore me down.  The author's keen observation is blunted by a writing style that leaves every character two-dimensional.  Neither plot nor interior life is engaging.  The Audible.com narrator is marvelous, making the characters and story as vivid as possible.
B00631VJIC|5.0|This CD is much better than anticipated.  It is very good and the music really is so Sons of Anarchy!  I would highly recommend that if you are a SOA fan - get this CD!!!
B004J4WV4Q|5.0|My husband has been using this brand for years. He just loves it!. They are very comfortable and very nice
B005B0QYMM|5.0|I didn't really know much about the movie going in, and had low expectations because of poor to mediocre reviews. I'm very glad I gave it a chance.  The beginning is a bit corny as you're introduced to the last footage taken by a television crew shooting for a ghost hunters type show.  This was a shoot for their sixth show in the series, and that footage they shot is the movie.  They are to spend the night in an abandoned psychiatric hospital, to try to document any supernatural phenomena.  I think any fan of horror can piece together the rest.  And it doesn't end well for the crew, but the course it takes was often creative and felt fresh.<br /><br />I thought the film was great especially for being low budget, and the special effects mixed in well with the visual style they chose to use.  The special effects were done well and at times had a \\"how did they do that?\\" feel like in Paranormal Activity.  There were times where they chose to point the camera away at specific times, but I didn't mind that so much because I felt it was done tastefully (adding tension to the scenes).  The acting was also great and the fear you see in the actors felt genuine.  The acting was good and I was convinced that I was behind the scenes with a small television crew.  I was also reminded of a Tales from the Crypt episode (i think one that came directly from the EC comic series actually)that is very similar.  So the idea isn't all that new, but again the cast and crew did a great job and it shows.<br /><br />Now that I've seen it, I'm kinda surprised by all the lackluster reviews it has been getting.  I'm a long time horror fan, and I felt like this was a great treatment of the genre.  In a time when horror is all over the place (It's a great time to be a fan of horror! And I hope that continues), this one was right down the middle for me.  It's a classic haunted house film at its core.  And while the course the story take makes creative turns it never tries to be something else.  Andthat's a good thing in my opinion.  It spoke to that primal fear, or unease of being alone in dark places.  It was very much like watching a terrible nightmare.  So I say give the film a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Also, it might be easy to write this off as a Paranormal Activity clone at first glance but I guarantee this is something different.  I've enjoyed a couple films in that series too, but I think this one does a little better job immersing you into the experience.  More of this film is in a first person perspective than occurs in Paranormal Activity.  You feel like your running through the corridors, hiding in rooms, and experiencing the fright alongside the crew.  (Don't get me wrong, the Paranormal Activity films are great.  I'm just trying to point out where they differ)
0439023521|4.0|As dark and macabre as the premise of this book is, I enjoyed it.  In a single noble act of self-sacrifice, we immediately get a glimpse of who the heroine is; a fighter, a protector, and someone who loves fiercely. However, she is not someone that can see the bigger picture.  In fact, she is quite impulsive and relies more on her instincts than on her intelligence, which has placed her in some deadly situations and probably would have killed her without the interventions of other characters. I imagine her common saying should be \\"ah, hindsight is always 20/20\\".  I felt that Collins did a good enough job weaving this world and keeping the story at such a fast pace, while building on for the future books, as well as inserting emotional complexities of our dear heroine and hero(es).  I could feel Katniss' inner turmoils as she played puppet to her mentor, to the public, and to the Capitol, all the while trying to hold a piece of herself.  A very promising series.
B006OB3K56|1.0|This is a movie supposedly about \\"sex addiction\\". But it really has nothing to say on that subject. Its more like Voyeurism of a so-called sex addict. The only points made end up being the obvious one that the main character has issues being close to women emotionally. But they mess even that point up by making the main character into the seduction master. He stares at women with his magic eyes and suddenly they decide on a quickie. It would have been more real for him to go after the desperate or the kind of women who are at a bar for last call. Its just silly to say that he can emotionally seduce almost magically while the basis for the character is emotional detachment.  What I liked least in the film is when it drags out one of the oldest cliche in the world and blames all of Brandon's problems on child abuse. They don't linger on it, but they make sure the point is clear.  The film is good at making sex boring and of communicating the problem of the sex addict in that sense. But it doesn't really make for a compelling film. The boring and empty activities of the film end up being boring for the audience as well.  The film adds in a redemption element through a sister. But its all really crude and obvious stuff. And the point reached at the end where he can only solve his own problems by attaching himself to the troubles of another person isn't very deep.  The director has given himself the primary writing credit for the film. But as with his previous film (Hunger), the secondary writing credit is given to an experienced writer (in this case Abi Morgan). After having done this twice, it really raises questions about how much of a writer/director he actually is. And why exactly he is giving himself the primary writing credit (not plotting credit or secondary credit for example) in his films.  Steve McQueen (the director) is of course more famous now for parties and being famous than he is for his work. He is a ruthless self-promotor of the Andy Warhol variety. Hehas shown some degree of talent, but after this film I wonder if the talent is more in the people he can gather around himself than his actual skill. This wasn't a great film and minus the talented actors who signed on the project, it would have been a terrible film. It may be that his real talent is more being a producer than a director.
0439023513|3.0|I kept flip-flopping on the rating I wanted to give. There is no doubt that Collins can weave exciting and imaginative tales, which adds to the disappointment I feel by this book. On the writing, I give her a 4 but how I felt about the book was a 2. So, split down the middle, this gets a 3. MAX.  Collins had a chance to really make this a spectacular finish to a gripping series, but, she fell flat. Katniss, whom we saw grow into a strong and determined fighter in the 1st became this whiny weakling whose internal monologues were reminiscent of Bella from Twilight. That is NOT a good thing.  In the beginning of Mockingjay, I felt that Katniss' pity party and self absorption was too much. If Collins was going for survivor's guilt, she definitely didn't hit it with me. People were laying down their lives because of an idea that was personified in her. Her decision to not give the Capitol the ending they wanted may have sparked something in the people, but, the resistance occurred because of the deaths of the children year after year from the games, from the starvation, from the injustice. She came off as egotistical and ungrateful while people were being tortured, maybe even killed. I began to really dislike her.  I found I grew to love the other characters more than her.  Is that supposed to happen?  In fact, the saving graces for Mockinjay WERE the other characters.  What got to me is that we learned a lot that was going on... not through Katniss, but, from other characters recounting of their tales or what was seen on the television. Aside from one shining moment, I didn't see the girl that was on fire. Everything happened TO her. No decisions, not even in her love life. It just fell into place. I can't even begin to discuss the disappointment I have over THAT. :sigh:. And all the death... I understand that in stories of war, death is prominent. But, at least have it MEAN something. If you've read the book, you'll know what I'm talking about.  I expected Katniss' character to grow and I felt like her ceiling occurred in the Hunger Games and slowly declined in Catching Fire, until she receded even from her original self in Mockinjay.  To me, this book is one that had me wondering at first when will it  begin? And finally, after certain events, wondering \\"when will this end?\\"
B004XCUEU2|5.0|...but I couldn't (buy local! BUY LOCAL!!) Anywho... Thanx to Amazon, I received this film 4 business days after ordering at an ok price...thanx Amazon. The film starts with background information about the band's beginnings, including the formation of Nirvana and the tragedy of the loss of Kurt Cobain. If you're a Gen X-er like myself, you'll be teary within the first 20 minutes of the film (we had a week long vigil in our building for his death while in college back in the day).. but hey this is about the Foo Fighters' right? Well the film moves along seamlessly to present day, filling in the blanks of any questions we may have had about members' past and present, personality conflicts, and difficult decisions made on behalf of the bands survival. The idea that most of the band's best albums have been recorded in Garages, Basements, within 5 days etc...just feeds fodder to their \\"Rock God\\" status... and here's the thing..these guys don't even identify as Rock Stars, but as musicians who are grateful to be working and doing what they love...it really makes me love them all the more. Also, if like me, and you get a woody from reminiscing on your H.S. Punk days, the narrative will take you back to DC's scene as well as others.<br />What I found most intriguing about the film itself (editing, lighting, direction, narrative) is its ability to attract an audience outside of their fans. There is a human component to the narrative that will allow anyone watching to see reflections of themselves within the context of some of the challenges documented. I turned this film on last night with the expectation of no one else watching it with me. My partner listens to Jazz and Blues and the family mostly hip hop. By the end of the film there were 9 people in the living room who had not heard their music(unless they heard it in my car at some point or another etc) who expressed how much they loved the film. I also think both Dave and Pat are transparent and warm enough to 'draw people in'. Nate reminds me of your heady/conspiracy theorist friend that can get too uptight if left to his own devices. Chris seems like the type of guy you'd wanna take a punch from at least one, just to see if you could handle it! LOL<br /><br />Lastly, as a social worker/researcher, I have to add that the Taylor Hawkins interview was inspiring...and I hope other young guys who are searching for ways to cope and survive listen to his take on how he's evolved as a person. My nephews are going thru my collections of Foo now and making mixed disc (like as we speak). I've heard \\"Oh I know THIS song. This is Foo Fighters?\\" about 4 times this hour.<br />Um yeah...from your Aunt who you two thought was too much of a blerd to be relevant....you're welcome!in'.

0307592731|4.0|The author, Cheryl Strayed writes with an honest voice about her life. There are plenty of reviews that describe the book in details, so I will not go into a full on book description here, but what I can say is that I could really feel her journey every step of the way because she writes with a real sense of honesty and detail.  It is well worth the read, especially if you enjoy reading memoirs.  For me, it is quite inspiring to read about people whose lives fall apart and then they somehow build the courage to go forward.  The book is her story, but quite a spiritual one, and inspiring.
0061714402|5.0|As a fan of Megadeth who likes every record they put out, this is definetely a must buy for me and it didnt disapoint. I'm not going to say much but if you're Megadeth fan then its worth getting, no more no less. It has lots of insight detail of what happening within the band throughout the years. The only low point to would be too many Metallica story in early pages... most of them has been said to death for many years and the last few chapters (TSHF-Endgame era) seems to be rushed and less detailed compare to the earlier chapters. The paperback version has added story of Dave reunion with David and the big 4 stories which is awesome to read. :)
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|good game for a little relaxing escape. did not like being forced to give review or write this. I payed for and played the game.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Best RPG I have seen on Android bar none.  A little complicated in the beginning, but after figuring out how to exploit the stars, it becomes a real joy.
B004NSULHM|5.0|What more can I say that hasn't been said already?  A tight, tense, dichotomous, atmospheric, colourful, concise masterpiece (of sorts).  Another bold step by Yorke and the lads into sonic territory unexplored by themselves or really anyone for that matter, creating a sound the likes of which I've never previously encountered. Think In Rainbows after being chewed up and spat out by a robot. Very rhythmic, repetitive, angular and synthetic.  Bloom - 4 out of 5  Morning Mr. Magpie - 4.5 out of 5  Little By Little - 3.5 out of 5  Feral - 4.5 out of 5  Lotus Flower - 4.5 out of 5  Codex - 4.5 out of 5  Give Up The Ghost - 5 out of 5  Separator - 4 out of 5  Fantastic album, check it out if you are a fan of any of the incredible releases they'd had since OK Computer.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are fun and the fact that there are a bunch of games makes it more interesting so your not playing the same thing over and over. however, building up points to unlock a game gets a little old also ads tend to get annoying but overall a very fun game to pass time :)
B0069UP2PI|1.0|Nothing ever happens in this movie. Thousands of people are supposed to be sick, but NO ONE ever works, municipal services collapse- it's the end of the world! Hollywood always goes for the cheap shot: if a bunch of people experience life in the same way (in this movie they are sick unto death), then we all must be having the same experience. No matter that people outside of big cities would not have the same exposure to disease that people in LA have.  And the ending about the source of the virus could hardly be any dumber. If it were even remotely true, the human race would never have gotten off the ground...  Get the old Dustin Hoffman movie about ebola disease, Breakout. Much better movie. It even has some explosions! And Rene Russo.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|While this book may not be as good as the first book I still loved it and cound't put it down. I do wish Suzanne Collins had made the series 4 books as there is so much that could've come out of this book. Many people have complained about the main characters whining and crying and PTSD. But I think the author did a great job adding to her characters. While I do feel who was killed was a bit rash and just thrown in there so some main character dies I still loved the book and the series.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|I was a little wary about ordering Super 8 from some of the reviews.  I really did enjoy the movie plus I am a sucker for a happy ending. I thought they had come to my street and neighborhood to film the movie. A reviewer had compared Super 8 to The Goonies - not even close. I did not think they let all of the kids personality's come to light mainly just the 3 main characters. I feel the story line was weak, real weak. The train wreck looked like models. The Professor, the Evil Air Force guy and the Alien did not have any character development. I could not hate the Evil Air Force guy or feel sorry for the Alien or the Professor. The makers of this movie missed something to make this a truly good movie that I would want to watch year after year. I still watch the Goonies from time to time and I am old. Don't stop watching the movie when the credits begin that is when they show the finished movie the kids were making. The biggest laugh for me was the almost the last line of the kid's movie where the director is speaking hoping it would be a Cleveland International Film Festival nominee. I think I liked it more than the movie Super 8 and it would be more likely of winning an award than Super 8.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|WOW. The premise of the book is so horrid to me, children fighting to their deaths?! Turned me off initially but my goodness I read all three books int his series in a few days. I loved how Suzanne Collins wrote the books. She had me mezmorized by the characters and their lives. I wanted to yell out loud at the Capital and help the children in the games. I got this book free from amazon prime ... but loved it so much that I bought the next two.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|had the app for about a month, completed first two levels and was pretty involved.  suddenly, yesterday there was some kind of change to the app and now i get huge ads and all my scores are gone.  seriously irritated.  just pay for the real app and hopefully you can avoid this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this whole series. While I was able to guess what was going to happen in this book, I still enjoyed it. I thought it was great to get to know more about the districts and do think the author couldn've made this into a 4 book series, while adding and spreading out what was going on. I enjoyed the relationships and getting to know some of the characters more and how their ways of life are so different. I would recommend this series to anyone. I loved it!
B00632HWOG|1.0|It's slow and craches a lot. Might as well send pigeon instead, might be faster and less headache. Save your time and space on your phone.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I started the 30 Day Shred on December 17, 2011. I completed it on January 24, 2012. I lost 17lbs, 7 inches in waist/hips, 4 inches in thighs, 1.5 inches in arms. It works, if you WORK it! I was a skeptic when I started the Shred. I attempted to do the Shred last Spring, but did not make it past the fourth day. With the threat of sleep apnea and other weight related health issues, I decided to do the 30 Day Shred again with a new level of determination. Jillian's a tough trainer, but it you stick it out (modifications, pause, yelling obsenities at television, holding on for dear life...ok, you get the point) you will see/experience the results:-)
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I'm nearly finished this book and am enjoying it so much I had to buy the 2nd and 3rd books to the series. It's easy to read with a interesting story line. Its suitable for teenagers and adults alike and its a great price.
B006H3MIV8|2.0|As a big fan of Dylan's work (as well as the many interpretations that have been produced over the years), I found this collection to be highly disappointing. Even the songs by the artists I thought I would like (e.g., Jackson Browne) just didn't measure up.  If you're looking for a collection of Dylan covers, I think the 30th Anniversary double album (when will they finally release this on DVD!?!) is excellent, and the \\"I'm Not There\\" soundtrack is not bad either.  [[ASIN:B00138H4CK Bob Dylan The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration]]  [[ASIN:B00138CXQW I'm Not There (Music From The Motion Picture)]]
B002MQYOFW|4.0|With all the reviews that this book has I almost feel silly leaving mine. I will keep it short and sweet because that is what I like. The book is written very well. The characters are engaging, the story is suspenseful, there are interesting twists, the plot is very momentous and most importantly I did not want to put it down until I was finished. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is because the ending left me hanging.
B0006B2A42|5.0|this was a gift for my husband have been looking for this movie found it ordered it and got it in 3 days just in time for Christmas!!! great service will order again
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I have always admired Jobs, but I learn so much from this book. Without a doubt the best Business Book I have ever read, and one of the best reads in a long time!<br /><br />Thanks Walter Isaacson.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Works very well on Kindle Fire. Relaxing music plays as you play this game. I like games like this that you can take your time its just challenging enough to keep you interested. For the price, its a good buy. If your considering it, give it a try, I think you will like it.
B0013ND30W|5.0|First of all let me state the truth, I haven't watched this movie in a long time and when I did ( some 20 years ago) I recalled it being dull and flat in it's imagery. Not the same, this remastered bluray is amazing. The colors are striking and its amazing how everything \\"pops\\". The story is great too, It's a classic, if you are a boy or a girl it doesn't matter, each can relate. This is a set I would highly recommend, and I would suggest buying it new and joining the Disney Movie rewards program, if you are going to buy the movies you might as well join the free points program, registering your movies gives you free streaming options ( on certain disks) an affordable disc replacement program and a few other minor benefits, its free so might as well. Oi, I sound like I'm being paid to advertise it, I'm not, I'm just a mom and I try to get the best deals possible and share it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book.... I honestly can't even describe it! It was soooo exciting and left me craving for the next book! I could go on and on about how amazing this book is, but to make things short, this book was the best book I have ever read!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this cover. It is durable and beautiful. My sister even decided to get a Fire just so she could buy this cover.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Season 4 of Sons of Anarchy is what I believe to be the best yet.  Almost every episode has you gripped to the edge of your seat wondering what could possibly come next.  Id say the mid season episodes starting with the episode titled \\"Hands\\" is where things really start to pick up steam.  This was an extremely strong, well acted, well written season for one of the most exciting shows on TV.  The performances by Ron Perlman, Charlie Hunnam, Maggie Siff and Katey Segal are so intense and terrific its hard to take your eyes off them for even a second.  I highly recommend Sons of Anarchy, Its a wonderful ride to be a part of.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|really enjoy playing this.game.  my only complaint is the fact that. I have to pound on the screen over and over to pick up the items.  I would consider buying the full game if I was sure this was fixed.
0545265355|5.0|Great read -- exciting, interesting, and provacative.  Ayn Rand in 2012.  Book one sets the tone of the Hunger Games.  Book two provides the twist.  Book three closes the deal.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I liked Evernote so much as an app on my Kindle Fire, that I also started using it on my PC; and since they will synch with one another, what is on my PC is on my Fire.<br /><br />I can create a grocery, to do, or other list on my Fire while I'm watching TV at night, and then when I get up in the morning, I can quickly print out those lists on the PC and be on my way to the store, do errands, etc.<br /><br />I am still pretty new to the app, so maybe I will find answers I currently don't know....but I wish I had more control over the way my notes are displayed and available to me. I LOVE that I can organize my lists into categories, but I'd rather always see my lists in category view than by date created. For this reason, I gave the app 4 vs. 5 stars.

B005J29HCQ|5.0|The \\"Smile Sessions\\" is a perfect synthesis of psychedelic music and lyrics that, in my opinion, has no peer in the history of popular music. Period. I have never experienced an album, until now, that I can listen to every day (and I do) without it becoming tiresome. \\"Our Prayer\\" is mind-blowing. Who else but the Beach Boys could produce those harmonies? \\"Heroes and Villains\\" is astonishing in its sheer inventiveness. Brian called \\"Good Vibrations\\" a \\"pocket symphony;\\" I would call Heroes and Villains a \\"pocket opera.\\" \\"Do You Like Worms,\\" despite missing some of the vocals, is amazing in its own right. The entire first suite, beginning with \\"Our Prayer,\\" and ending with \\"Cabin Essence,\\" is elusive yet accessible. The almost buried (on purpose) vocals at the end of \\"My Only Sunshine\\" and throughout \\"Cabin Essence\\" add an element of mystery to these songs that is very cool indeed. \\"Cabin Essence\\" is an under-appreciated masterpiece that is every bit the equal of \\"Good Vibrations,\\" and should be studied and deconstructed by anyone interested in music composition. The sounds of the railroad - of \\"Who ran the iron horse\\" - are heard as you close your eyes and listen. It takes Spector's \\"wall of sound\\" to a whole new level, and every time I hear it I am left wondering: how did he do it? There's never been anything like it, and never will be. Of course, one can say that about the entire album.  \\"Wonderful\\" starts off the second suite, and is, well, wonderful; Brian's voice has never sounded more beautiful than on this and \\"Surf's Up,\\" which, if I had to pick a favorite, \\"Surf's Up\\" would be it. I love the lyrics: \\"I heard the word. Wonderful thing! A children's song. Have you listened as they play? Their song is love and the children know the way.\\" \\"Surf's Up,\\" classically structured in three parts of almost equal length (like the album), is otherworldly in its beauty from start to finish. It's hard to believe that Brian and Van Dyke wrote this and several other SMiLE songs in one night! Of course, let's not forget \\"Look\\" and \\"Child Is Father Of The Man\\" - I can't get enough listens to the latter, even though it's lacking some of the vocals and strings found on the Brian Wilson version.  Finally, we're on to the third suite, which perhaps more fully embodies the \\"divine\\" and the \\"dumb\\" of the original \\"Dumb Angel\\" title, starting with \\"I Wanna Be Around.\\" \\"Vega-Tables\\" always puts a smile on my face, and it's easy to overlook the beautiful melodies underneath the humorous lyrics (see the 45 version in the box set for the best version of this song). \\"Holidays\\" is missing some vocals but still packs a punch, especially the whispering winds ending. \\"Wind Chimes\\" consists of a lush Carl Wilson vocal and an early calm that soon gives way to a more rocking ending that is unexpected but incredible. \\"Fire,\\" part of the original Elements suite, is unlike anything you've ever heard, and is the only song I used to skip over but have lately developed an appreciation for it, as it's yet another example of how cinematic and epic this whole album is - the music always sounds like the lyrics - it's very impressionistic throughout. I love the percussion in \\"Love to Say Dada,\\" and closing the album proper is \\"Good Vibrations,\\" a piece of pop perfection that still amazes despite countless listens, and is even more powerful with the \\"hum-de-dum\\" section and the altered ending.  It took 44 years but it was worth the wait!
B002GLSX8C|5.0|As I was browsing Amazon, as I frequently do when I'm procrastinating while doing homework, I happened to stumble across this, and noticed that it is free (streaming) for Prime members. So, being the huge Led Zeppelin fan that I am, I decided to watch this as I was doing my homework. Needless to say, I have been on problem #21 in my differential equations book for the past 2 hours and 17 minutes. I simply could not peel my eyes away from the screen. I was drumming along with my pencils along with Bonzo the entire time. The world around me ceased to be as I was there in New York City 35 years ago. I can only imagine how much better it would have been on DVD or Blu-Ray with surround sound. Regardless, do yourself a treat and set aside some time to watch this. And if you have Prime, it's absolutely free! So what more reason do you need? I might be a little grumpy at my 8AM class tomorrow morning as I likely won't finish my homework until 3AM now, but without any shadow of a doubt, it was worth it. I probably will watch it again before I go to bed. It begins a little strangely, but it got right to the point. The setlist is superb, playing all of their biggest hits up through Houses of the Holy, although being Led Zeppelin, they could have played anything and it would have been equally amazing. Throughout the film, they highlight each member of the quartet individually as they play a song that specifically takes advantage of their abilities (No Quarter for JPJ, Moby Dick for Bonzo, The Song Remains the Same for Plant, and Dazed and Confused for Page). Furthermore, the visuals throughout the entire movie are simply breathtaking, from actually being in the stadium as they play to the sub-stories of each individual member. In typical Zeppelin fashion, each song is heavily improvised and never fails to astound. They do things with their music that I had never imagined possible. When Jimmy Page began playing with the bow during Dazed and Confused, I was astonished that firstly I had never heard of him doing this before and also that more people don't do this. Never before in my life have I wished so much that I had been born 30 years earlier so I could have actually been there. Since I can't (sigh) this is certainly the next best thing. You will not be disappointed.

159420229X|4.0|Moonwalking with Einstein tells the journey of Joshua Foer who went from being a journalist covering the U.S. Memory Championship to actually winning it a year later.  This book is a combination of a very interesting story and a very accessible account of memory. This is not a self-help book but it does provide some glimpses of techniques that can help you improve your memory, such as the memory palace. Such techniques are not new, so if you're rather well versed you will probably learn nothing new from reading this book, but you will still be able to enjoy the great story in it (like I did).

0743298039|5.0|Vida Winter, England's most famous and reclusive writer, selects Margaret Lea to come to her estate and pen her biography before she dies. The excessively bookish young woman only has a few obscure biographical pamphlets under her belt and has never even read Ms. Winter's books. Margaret is intrigued by the secretive author and sees mirrored in her some of her own family secrets.<br /><br />I was immediately sucked into Vida Winter's tale; It has it all - secrets, insanity, incest, obsession, murder, ghosts... the carefully plotted and paced story never disappointed me, and for once, I did not see the plot twist at the end. It is very easy to make comparisons to novels like [[ASIN:0143034901 The Shadow of the Wind]] and [[ASIN:0679735909 Possession]].

B002SR2PKG|4.0|So apparently there is an actual term for fear of clowns: \\"coulrophobia\\".  Well, I'm pretty sure that this novel and the subsequent movie has spawned that phobia in large numbers of people over the past couple of decades.  Clowns always had that creep factor in my mind, and they have scared the you-know-what out of me since childhood.  Naturally, reading this before bed for a couple of weeks was a less than stellar way to achieve a good night's sleep... but the book was really good.<br /><br />The story tells the tale of seven childhood friends who are all somewhat outcasts in their own right and the horrifying experiences that they endured in 1958.  Something, \\"It\\", was terrorizing their town of Derry, Maine, and children were disappearing.  Sometimes their mutilated bodies were found, and sometimes they weren't.  \\"It's\\" apparition of choice is that of a clown named Pennywise who seems to dwell in the sewers... which gives him access to each and every house and apartment in town.  But our seven protagonists find themselves as targets for the shape-shifting terror that is living and feeding off of their home, especially when they decide that the time has come to kill It.<br /><br />The story also picks up on the lives of those friends twenty-seven years later in 1985 as they all come back to Derry when It begins to start Its cycle of murder again.  Most of them have left Derry and established their adult lives elsewhere, but they made a pact as kids that they would all return to Derry if It resurfaced so they could finish what they started -- and finally kill It for good.<br /><br />The book doesn't tell the story chronologically; instead, King jumps back and forth from 1958 to 1985, often in mid-sentence.  It can be a little difficult to follow at times (particularly if you're searching for a stopping point), but it brilliantly juxtaposes events from the past and present.  Since the book is so long, this method of writing does help to keep the different happenings and incidents from both time periods fresh in your mind, and both sides of each character remain in the forefront of your mind.  So while at times it may take an extra moment or two to navigate, I think it's very effective in the long run.<br /><br />I was listening to an interview with Stephen King not too long ago, and he mentioned that when he writes, he does so with one key question in his mind: \\"What is the worst possible thing that could happen?\\"  Well, if everything in this book happened to someone, I'm pretty sure it couldn't get much worse.  Mission accomplished!  I was already jumpy after reading about this psychopathic clown, but when he brought my other fear into it -- a spider, thanks for that -- my nerves were pretty much shot.<br /><br />This wasn't my favorite Stephen King book, but it's still a great read!  Fair warning: you may be afraid of your bathroom for a while.  And I think it'll be a while before I'm comfortable walking near a storm drain again. ;)and incidents from both time periods fresh in your mind, and both sides of each character remain in the forefront of your mind.

B006H3MIV8|2.0|Dylan doesn't allow free downloads of his music and blocks all You Tube posts of unauthorized video so if you want this--you BUY it. Fine...except when I am buying a 4 disc set of Cd's I expect the music to captivate me..many people in the world are already POOR so we ALL are in the same \\"charity need\\" situation...any excuse that this is \\" for charity\\" is not a good enough excuse anymore for really bad covers. And that is what we have here...from the insanely awful (no matter how many people tell me it is so full of energy it STILL SUCKS)  \\"Desolation Row\\" cover by My chemical Romance to  Kesha *crying?) to Miley Cyrus and on, there are VERY few GREAT covers. Even Mark Knofler, who is usually incapable of error, errs. His version of Restless Farewell is not only boring but somehow recorded in a different tempo./time and key than Bob's. It changes the song for the worse. STING..he ruins Girl from the north Country. And he is not the worst of the lot.  I am aware artists can take liberties with tracks when they cover it...but so many tracks are horribly worse than the original there was no point to put them on the release except to inflate the price. I would have cut the number of tracks at least in HALF because so many are skippable. Also MANY of these tracks have already been released on other compliations or soundtracks. We have heard them.  Are there any GREAT cover tracks here? A few---Ballad of Hollis Brown by Rage Against the machine is excellent, so is Tom Morello's take on Blind Willie. But the song choices are also in question ..no one can cover one of Dylans greatest \\"Ballad of a Thin man\\" or some of Bob's great newer songs such as Ain't Talkin?
B001BANK32|5.0|One of the reasons I respect Stephen King so much is the breadth of his books.  His storylines are so unique that there is certain to be a book that grabs each of us.  I think that's why so many people cite different books as their favorite King novel!  For me, \\"The Shining\\" is it (although I always enjoy reading his other stuff to see if there is something that can actually top this).<br /><br />I will preface this by saying that the book is very different than the Stanley Kubrick film.  They are two very different stories, although both brilliant when taken as they are and not lumped together.  The movie is one of my favorites, and I actually watched it before reading the book.  However, the novel is at the top of my list as well!<br /><br />The book begins with Jack Torrance interviewing for a position as the winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel which is nestled high in the mountains of Colorado.  The hotel closes every winter as it is just short of impossible to access due to the weather, and there is a need for someone to stay there in order to make repairs, rotate heat throughout the hotel, and perform other preventive maintenance.  For Jack, this seems perfect.  Financially, things have been tough, and as a writer, he could greatly use those months to finish his work without much distraction.  When he gets the job, he settles in for the snowy season with his wife, Wendy, and son, Danny.<br /><br />The character development of Jack has a huge effect on the entire book.  Jack moves into the Overlook with a lot of personal baggage.  He is an on-the-wagon alcoholic whose tornadic past resulted in unemployment, a strained marriage, and a heavy sense of parental guilt.  His personal demons trace back to his childhood, and it's evident that his self-confidence was flushed down the toilet a while back.  Although somewhat reluctantly, he recognizes the Overlook as an opportunity for redemption: it provides employment, free room and board, a chance to get his writing career back on track, and an environment where there is absolutely no alcohol.  His only problem is that the Overlook has a much different agenda.<br /><br />The book differs from the movie in that the true villain is the Overlook itself.  This is the epitome of haunted house stories.  There are ghosts, there is a dark history, and there is evil incarnate living and breathing in the walls of the hotel itself.  The Overlook sees Jack's vulnerabilities and exploits them.<br /><br />The Overlook's true character is primarily viewed through the eyes of two of the main characters: Jack and his son, Danny.  Young Danny has what is called \\"the shining\\".  He can see things (among other abilities), and the Overlook throws this poor kid's sixth sense into overdrive.  He witnesses gruesome scenes of violence that have happened over the years in the hotel.  And as the winter progresses, he too becomes the target of the Overlook's attention, although in a very different way than his father.<br /><br />And poor Wendy is just pulling her hair out trying to figure out what's wrong with her husband and her son.<br /><br />Not only is the book classically haunting, but there is a sense of mystery as the history of the Overlook is pieced together and as its intentions are revealed.  The hotel really is as much a main character in the book as Jack, Danny, or Wendy.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most striking themes in the book is the true isolation of Jack, Wendy, and Danny.  As their horror story unfolds, it really hits home that there is no escaping this situation.  When you read that it's only Thanksgiving, you realize that they have four months to go before the hotel reopens.  There are those constant questions of \\"how much worse can it get?\\" and \\"how much longer can they last?\\"  Ironically, in a recent Stephen King interview, he said that when he writes, he always keeps this question in mind: What is the worst possible thing that could happen?  Well, that should give you an ideaof just how bad things go for these three people!<br /><br />This isn't one of Stephen King's longer novels, so the events escalate at a more rapid rate.  Thus, it's gripping from the start, is very suspenseful, and is a quick read.<br /><br />On an exciting note, Stephen King recently announced that he is currently writing a sequel!  I won't write the premise here since it will give a little spoiler to the end of this book, but you can search it online.  Title is \\"Dr. Sleep\\". :)g's longer novels, so the events escalate at a more rapid rate.  Thus, it's gripping from the start, is very suspenseful, and is a quick read.

B003Y5H5EW|4.0|It's rare that we endorse the systematic eradication of a species, let alone two of them. But when they're as threatening to man as vampires and werewolves are, I won't lose any sleep over it. Except that the vampires have a champion, however reluctant, and as played by Kate Beckinsale, Selene - with her slinky black leathers and take-no-prisoner attitude - swings the balance the other way yet again. So, here I am rooting for the bloodsucker and resenting humanity. Damn you, Kate Beckinsale.<br /><br />I'm guessing YouTube, but however way it went down, the human world now knows of the existence of vampires and Lycans - and that means bad cess to vampires and Lycans. Humanity reacts predictably: it sets out to reclaim its seat at the top of the foodchain. UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING opens with a voiceover narration from Selene which recaps the first two films and then catches us up to current events, namely the Cleansing. The Cleansing proved to be dangerous - you could even say \\"terminal\\" - years for vampires and Lycans. It got so bad that Selene and Michael, her hybrid lover, opted to get out of town. Except that Selene was captured enroute to her rendezvous with Michael and taken to a high security research facility and cryogenically frozen, ostensibly so that scientists can conduct tests on her to find a \\"cure.\\" Cue the ominous soundtrack.<br /><br />Twelve years would elapse before Selene (or \\"Subject One\\") escapes her icy coffin and the clutches of Stephen Rea's creepy scientist. She emerges to a world which now believes that the vampire covens and Lycan packs have become near extinct. Selene's frantic search for Michael is derailed when she stumbles across a young hybrid vampire-Lycan girl (India Eisley) with whom she shares a psychic link. At least the film doesn't try to get coy regarding their relationship.<br /><br />The remaining Lycans desperately want their claws on this girl (for a spot of DNA harvesting), and so Selene finds herself in familiar territory, reassuming her Death Dealer persona and kicking werewolves harshly to the curb. There's more to the plot than that, but that is the gist of the narrative. Except for one human police detective ally (Michael Ealy), the humans' involvement gradually diminishes in the story.<br /><br />You can dismiss this franchise. You can make with the snarky and call it a B-movie and low brow and common denominator and cheesy and such, and my rebuttal goes like this: alabaster British beauty Kate Beckinsale furiously whuppin' butt in skin-tight black leather. Swedish directing duo Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein were charged with bringing UNDERWORLD back to the big screen, but they couldn't have done shizzy had Beckinsale not come back for another tour of duty. Beckinsale's cool swagger and deadpan determination are what I signed on for (sorry, Rhona Mitra). No, the dialogue isn't at an Oscar Wilde level and the acting is minimal and that's certainly not Scott Speedman briefly playing \\"Michael\\" (which may or may not be a good thing). But, again, I retort with Kate Beckinsale. She's like a classier Alice from RESIDENT EVIL (yes, because she has a cool British accent). Selene in the UNDERWORLD films is just one of my many guilty pleasures.<br /><br />I've always felt that for being a vampire, Selene was lacking in certain \\"vampiry\\" traits and, in fact, she seemed to rely overmuch on firearms. So I'm glad we get to see a scene in which Selene finally gets to bloodily gnaw at a throat. I'm fascinated by her place in the vampire hierarchy. By many accounts, she's regarded as a traitor to her species. She's killed two Elder vampires. She fell in love with a werewolf hybrid. She happens to be immune to sunlight. One can see where the other nosferatu may eye her with suspicion. Selene follows her own moral code which doesn't necessarily coincide with the traditional edicts of the reigning vampire societies.<br /><br />UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING unloads scenes of blistering action and more action.It also tries to give you 3-D, but don't hold that against it. I just saw HAYWIRE and made mention of how sturdy I thought Gina Carano was. But Selene takes even greater punishment. The special effects are top notch. I really like the big bad wolfman, and how he was depicted and then eventually defeated. India Eisley, the hybrid teen, merits two sequences in which she flexes her badassery. Werewolf skulls will get split in half. Other body parts will be cloven in two or eviscerated or just lopped off. Fun. And somewhere along the way Selene will demonstrate a pretty rough way to resuscitate a dead vampire. The way the film ends leaves a possibility for another sequel. Odds are, Stephen Rea won't be signing up for it.It also tries to give you 3-D, but don't hold that against it. I just saw HAYWIRE and made mention of how sturdy I thought Gina Carano was.

But ultimately, it left me saying that I shouldn't be surprised that this is Rothfuss' debut novel.<br /><br />Let's start with the fact that the author spoils most of the dramatic tension of the book from the very beginning. After plodding through the first 50 pages -- by far the novel's worst -- we learn that our protagonist is a contemporary hero hiding himself as an innkeeper in a tiny village. He is found out by \\"the Chronicler\\" and decides to tell him his story, to clear up all the legends floating about. Thereby, we learn that this much storied hero has grown old, grown timid, and worst of all: has survived the perils of the world.<br /><br />Isn't the point of reading a good fantasy novel that we get to adventure alongside our hero as she or he battles demons, dragons, and the machinations of the heart -- all the while, wondering if they'll survive the worst of it or die in the arms of a friend or once-endangered lover? Instead, our author has already taken all the fun out of every awful encounter in the book as we know with perfect certainty that our hero will make it through, unscathed, to eventually make a dubious real estate purchase. Thrilling.<br /><br />Of all the recent fantasy, this book shares the most tropes with Harry Potter -- dead parents, gifted child, school for magicians, eccentric professors, etc. -- but unfortunately shares none of the wit or cleverness. And while we readers raced breathlessly through every uncertain Voldemort encounter toward the inevitable series climax, wondering which of the two would survive (only one can!!), here we're left with none of the mystery or suspense as each rising action is broken by an interlude back at the dreary Waystone Inn, where our protagonist forces the Chronicler to slowly learn how every fantastic story told about great deeds was actually just a turn of magic little better than a long-practiced card trick.<br /><br />These \\"flash-forwards\\"/interludes are so ham-fisted and begrudging that I can't help but wonder if they're the work of an inexperienced editor who demanded a \\"greater\\" structure to the story before it could be sold.<br /><br />For all its faults, I'll reiterate that it's not an /awful/ book... but that's a rather low bar to cross, isn't it? There were some enjoyable moments that I often met with uncertainty, wondering if there was just a little too much wish-fulfillment going on. I do long to learn the answers to a few well-placed mysteries that will undoubtedly be explored in later books, but I'm just not sure if my curiosity is worth the next 993 pages of foregone conclusions...grudging that I can't help but wonder if they're the work of an inexperienced editor who demanded a \\"greater\\" structure to the story before it could be sold.  For all its faults, I'll reiterate that it's not an /awful/ book... but that's a rather low bar to cross, isn't it?

0307949486|3.0|It's been so hyped up, that I thought it'd be amazing.  But it was really just okay.  Maybe I'd have thought it was better if it wasn't so hyped up, that I was expecting a masterpiece. After I made it through the reallllly slooow first third or so of the book, it kept my attention enough to want to finish it.  Though I really thought there would be more to it though - I thought something else was coming, more twists, more connections...something.  The ending was quite abrupt - perhaps leaving room for the next book in the trilogy?
159420229X|5.0|Foer introduced me to a whole new world of memory training and competition. To date, this is the best non-fiction I have read by a long shot. He combines a fine, dramatic storyline with plenty of history, interesting science, healthy skepticism, and characters one can appreciate. I am astounded that Foer put together such a wonderful book his first time out of the gate. Bravo.
B005VTGB0S|2.0|The product arrived and it had obviously been previously opened as the labeling seal had been cut  and another sticker placed over top of it. When I opened the box the item was sitting on top of a the  crumpled plastic bag that should have been wrapped around it. The cover looked undamaged, but was in no way marked as a return. If this item was a gift, this would have been very disappointing, as I would have expected a new product.  On first inspection there is no cut out for camera on the back of an Ipad 2. The elastic straps have Velcro  hooks sewn into them, presumably so that the strap tightness could be adjusted to accommodate the  different tablets it advertises it will fit. The bad part of this is that the Velcro hooks will be right up  against the screen, possibly causing scratches. On putting the tablet in the case I found that in addition  to the camera being covered up that two of the four physical control switches on the Ipad2 are also covered (the sleep switch and the slide lock switch in the upper right hand side).  The fit is not very secure. The edge of the Ipad2 comes right up next to the edge of the case, so if dropped the device  would impact with little or no protection. The stand feature is nice, with multiple viewing angles, but there is no option for a portrait stand and the angles offered make typing difficult. If you need an attractive stand for your desk, this will work  but I'd recommend against taking your tablet out of the house with this case as its only protection.
B005HSL626|3.0|good game wont rotate screen for when I have it on its side and prop it up on a stand its upside down.
0345505387|5.0|I love the Outlander series and when I heard that a graphic novel had been written from Jamie's Point of View, I purchased it it as soon as I could.<br /><br />The Exile begins a little before the Outlander and ends about 1/3 the way through the original novel.  It is actually from Murtagh, Jamie's godfather, Dougal, Geillis and Jamie's perspectives.<br />I liked the fact that there were storylines going on that were not visible in the original book, but they fit in with the timeline of the original.  I enjoyed seeing scenes from Jamie's eyes and his first impressions of Claire.<br /><br />The graphics were well done.  I love the expressiveness of the faces, the action sequences, and I thought Mr. Nguyen did a good job with representing how the characters, the props, and scenery would have looked.<br /><br />Worth it even if you're not into graphic novels.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|this app is stupid it wont even flip the screen so when I use tablet on stand it wont flip to what I can only do proped up.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have found this Bible a very useful tool in my day to day walk with Christ. It has all the version so it u want the amp,or the niv,it got it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I downloaded this game on my kindle fire and it works awesome! only problem is a lot of ads, but its free so what do you expect?
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Nice app. Connecting is pretty is easy on a local wifi network. Connects easily via your Google account too. Just have to make sure you can wake your remote device with a network connection. Would really like to see the ability to copy files back and forth.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Well I mean jets a good app don't get me wrong. but the games like ummm car chaos way to fast but I like the app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've been using this app for almost 2 years before that I had a palm pea with olive trees Bible app on it. When I switched yo aneroid I was happy to find a descent free Bible app but there were a lot of features I missed.<br /><br />Two years latter this app has almost all of them. The only reason to pay for an android Bible app is if you need advanced study tools. I'm still hoping youversion will find a way to come up with those eventually.
B001N26GFC|2.0|I'm an optimist, and was looking forward to seeing a movie that promoted having a positive attitude (not the most common view in the world today, especially considering how lucky many of us are).  But I was extremely uncomfortable at how such \\"happiness\\" was displayed.  I think that Poppy used her humour like a bludgeon, and although she showed compassion at times, this was definitely countered by moments of thoughtless (one hopes) cruelty.  And why did the actress, in order to show her constant glee, have to come across as such a mouth breather?
B005C9YZIW|4.0|I thought the veiws in this program were spectacular; the theme was mostly on animals; which hence the title I thought it would be more into Mother nature. I tend to get a little upset when I see animals in Nature; because lets face it they are animals. Some are totally defenseless against each other and this makes me want to save them all. The program tended to repeat itself from time to time on different disc. I also would have liked to have seen a little more of United states on there; we do have wild life left don't we?
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is lots of fun. This ones is simple to use and pretty easy to win. I recommend it to everyone, all ages.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am used to Spider solitaire on the big laptop screen, so I wondered how I would like this version for my Kindle.  It loads fast, is very responsive, and the tap feature makes the game zip along.  Also the deals seem more challenging than the game I've got on my computer,which means it rewards me just enough to keep me hooked.  All in all it is quite satisfying.  Would definitely recommend.  So far. I have not found the little adverts to be intrusive enough to be annoying.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I love Brad Pitt in this movie. The storyline is so outrages it is soooooo good. Everyone needs to see this movie at least once.
B002WWKZJK|5.0|I must admit that I love Georgette Heyer and am making my way through her catalog in the slowest way possible (so as to savor each find).  I LOVED this novel though (Cotillion was my favorite until now), Horry is an amazing heroine who, after her marriage, finds a love of spending money and gambling. Shenanigans ensue from there and, yes, there are two swordfights and plenty of scheming.  Others have outlined the plot in more depth on here, so I won't rehash, but the ending is assuredly happy!  I can't imagine why nobody has made her books into movies (even a set-in-the-present movie)...
B005F96UNM|5.0|I had never heard anything about this when I watched it. I just saw it had Woody Harrelson and Ron Pearlman in it and figured I'd give it a shot. From the first 10 seconds I could tell this was my kind of movie. It starts off very strange with a kind of dark humor intro that sets the tone for the whole movie. The movie is set up more like a Broadway play than a Hollywood action flick, but unlike some other movies I've seen like that, this one works very well. Most of the acting in this is phenomenal, and it maintains it's humor through the tongue-in-cheek performances of the stars. Josh Hartnett does an awesome job of carrying the film as the lead, and Woody Harrelson is fantastic as always. Despite never having heard of it, I was surprised by how awesome this movie really was. I don't know anything about how it was released, but this should have been a major blockbuster. It reminded me of Sin City but with more heart and structure. It takes a combination of many genre's of film and adds that to a combination of many ages-old stories of revenge, redemption, courage, etc. and combines them all beautifully. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of movies that do not adhere to the norm, or anyone who is a fan of Woody Harrelson, as he can seem to do no wrong lately.
B0061S073A|5.0|It does just as it says and gives me comfort in leaving my Fire with my kids without constant supervision. Kids Place exits when Fire is powered down so setup your lock code and don't tell it to your kid. I keep Kids Place in favorites so I can immediately load it then give to my 6 or 3 year olds with peace of mind.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of fun on the go. The more you play, the more games you unlock. I like the challenge of figuring out how to play each game.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I love this beautiful cover and would definitely recommend it! It has the look of an old, vintage book. In addition to looking good, it holds my Kindle Touch securely and protects it as it should. However, I gave it four stars instead of five because of two negatives--at least negatives for me. When I first received the cover it had a VERY strong, unpleasant odor. I can't describe what it smelled like but it was bad enough I knew I couldn't live with it. I thought of sending it back but loved it so much I wanted to find a way to use it if I could. I remedied the odor problem by sealing the cover in a bag with fabric softener sheets for several days and that took care of it. The other negative, in my opinion, is it has nothing to keep it closed when not in use. A magnetic strap closure--like a diary or journal--or something similar would be great.
B004132HZS|5.0|Sherlock is great. Produced by the same people who write Doctor Who, I think, this show is incredibly intelligent for this day and age. Brilliant, stylish and sassy, this show will hook you. Guaranteed. Martin Freeman is unassuming and you would think not the sort of fellow to be in a serious drama. As far as I can tell, he's mostly the straight guy in comedies - but in Sherlock, his character is a man to be reckoned with, just a little dark but likeable, someone you can root for.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock is unabashedly acidic, doesn't put up with bs from anyone and is both brilliant and hilariously, sympathetically flawed. He is perfectly arrogant, ill-tempered and nasty at times - and inspires serious envy, especially for people who've felt like their head was about to explode from the sheer, mind-boggling, numbing stupidity they're required to put up with.<br /><br />I really can't say much more. This is a rare jewel in a world of too many movies with no plot, no intelligence and no respect for the audience.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|The only thing I can say is that.. I am Soooo sad there is no more Christian and Ana. I really really enjoyed reading the series. Fifty Shades  has it all- Love, Hate, Sex, Crazy, Money , Power, Romance .  Before Freed was release, I reread Grey and Darker again( Love it a second time).. I WILL most definitely reread Freed and possibly all three again. (could there be anything better)???? It would be great to continue this beautiful romance and see more into Christian and Ana life together with children.. Thank you  E L James- Love them all....
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it!  It is just plain fun!! I like playing it when I'm bored. its entertaining but not to mind taxing.
1597772992|5.0|Everyone needs to read and hear the China Study. I bought the book and also the CD's so I could listen in the car.  You wonder why we all look the same in America this is probably why, and why we are all so burdened with different desease's.  Don't be stupid get the book and decide for yourself.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Putting this on the Kindle Fire adds very little bulk or weight and looks pretty cool. The cover doubling as a stand is a big plus because it works quite well and the inside of the cover flap wipes finger smudges away simply by closing the cover. Would strongly recommend for anyone looking to add a bit of protection to their Kindle Fire.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Use this app every day. Sync to my phone and laptop from Kindle Fire. I'm finding new uses all the time.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|\\"Les Miserables\\" is one of the greatest novels ever ritten.  In addition, its musical counterpart stands as an example of one of the greatest theater productions ever to be created.  Exploring such universal themes as love, law versus grace, and sacrifice, the show contains beautiful characters and unforgettable music.<br /><br />This story is set against the backdrop of the French Revolution.  Jean Valjean is a convict who has just been released after a nineteen-year prison sentence for stealing a loaf of bread.  He is given his \\"yellow ticket of leave,\\" which marks him as a criminal, and which he must present everywhere he goes.  After receiving unexpected kindness from a bishop he robs, Jean Valjean makes the decision to break his parole and start a new life.  However, his decision incurs relentless pursuit from the stern yet, ultimately, tormented Inspector Javert.  Jean Valjean will be forced on a journey in which he'll meet unforgettable characters and make momentous decisions that will effect many lives.<br /><br />This 25th anniversary concert is a true delight from start to finish.  I was particularly mesmerized by Alfie Boe, who brings a tenderness to the role of Jean Valjean.  Although Colm Wilkinson is truly delightful, it is nice to hear a different voice: one that fairly soars with beauty.  Norm Lewis, who portrays Inspector Javert, is truly stunning.  He brings anger, sadness and a steadfast determination to his role.  Javert is one of my favorite characters, and Mr. Lewis truly emphasizes the police inspector's conflicted emotions and unwillingness to submit to the grace that is offered him.  Eponine, my absolute favorite character of the show, is wonderfully portrayed by Samantha Barks.  Her tender voice throbs with pain for her unrequited love for Marius, and her sacrificial actions shine through.  Lea Salonga is perfect as Fantine, the mother who will resort to any means to save her child from cunning and ruthless caregivers.  The other cast members are equally wonderful.<br />Regarding those who are giving Mr. Nick Jonas, (the pop star who portrays Marius), such a hard time: I honestly thought he did very well.  He is not trained in musical theater, yet his emotions are clear.  Jonas obviously tries very hard and loves the material.<br /><br />Please give this wonderful production a chance.  God bless you all.rful.  Regarding those who are giving Mr. Nick Jonas, (the pop star who portrays Marius), such a hard time: I honestly thought he did very well.

B005LJK3AC|2.0|I was in the queue at the public library, but I was so far down the list (about #261), it would have taken about six months for my turn to see this movie. So when this title came up as the video deal of the day today, I thought it was worth the deal price to see it now. That was until I actually watched it.  The best part of the movie was about the last 7 minutes, which included the outtakes. I'm not at all a prude, but vulgar language and innuendo, simply for the sake of so-called comedy, was a gigantic failure and a complete bore. For the first time of years of DVD-watching, this was the first time I had to check the time remaining, to see how much more of this was left to endure.  That's 98 minutes of my life I'll never get back, and even though it was only 99 cents, I still feel like I'm entitled to a refund, based on extreme disappointment.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Having a hard time playing. But beside that I think that the game is just a little okay. Wouldn't recommend it to my friends.
0062502182|5.0|I think pretty much everyone would like this book.  You can take from it what you will, but it is beautifully written - simple, profound and mystical, like stories of the past.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is awesome. I would definitely recommend downloading it. Great fun for all ages. Ive unlocked about half of the games and I'm totally hooked.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Santana haden't even officially released thier debut album at the time they set the stage on fire at Woodstock.  Thier jaw dropping performance of Soul Sacrifice put Santana on the forfront of the music lovers conciousness.  This performance is the stuff of music legend.  After the release of Santana's self titled debut it deservedly shot to number 4 on the charts helped by the suberb single Evil Ways (a top 10).  The first 4 Santana albums (5 if you count the amazing Live At The Fillmore cd) are absolutly essential to every classic rock collection.  If you do not own these albums than your collection will be forever incomplete.  The way Santana were able to fuse latin blues psychedilic rock is nothing short of astounding.  This record in particular is an example of what originality and talent the band possesd, thier is truly not a bad cut on this album and things were only going to get better from here. It is amazing to think that they finished this album in one month.  A must own!
1439102813|5.0|Still Alice was a deeply affecting book.  The story is told with exquisite sensitivity, another way to say the author is a fine writer.  I highly recommend the book and am eager to read her other book(s).
0684135051|4.0|I ordered this book to add to my knitting reference library. I don't necessarily agree with all EZ says (yes, I'm a heretic!), but she does give insight into why do we do what we do. Also \\"gives\\" us knitters the okay to think for ourselves, and do things the way we want.
0553801473|3.0|As a long-time fan of this series, the fifth installment, A Dance with Dragons, has really left a sour taste in my mouth. Where the first four books took me a few days to read each, this installment took me over a month due to lack of interest. It seems to me that GRRM has killed so many characters I loved that more than half of his books are filled with tedious chapters about characters I could not care less about. By the end of A Dance With Dragons, I was shocked and angry by another choice he made dealing with yet another beloved character. Seems to me GRRM, despite his skill in the craft, has gutted his own story, is desperate to put it back together, and not as mindful of moving it forward, which is tragic so near to the end of this series. Two books left; I hope they make up for A Dance with Dragons.
B000FC1AOI|5.0|What a wonderful book. Had a hard time putting it down. I had seen the movie and I thought it was good, but after reading the book, I loved it more. The movie doen't go into detail and glosses over a lot of the story. I was surprised at the ending. Didn't go the way I had imagined it would. But anyway...a beautiful story, nonetheless. I know I will reread it. You can feel the devastation that Holly is going through and how her sadness affects her friendships. This book is sad, funny, romantic, surprising and so much more. Love it!
B0001AP12G|5.0|20 stars you're amazing! But it took so long to get here it broke my little heart. Also the inside of the case was broken making it very dangerous for the disc. Tis Tis.
B000LC4TJ0|3.0|Approaching this interpretation of one of the best operas ever written, with such a star-studded cast, one holds his breath in anticipation.  It has been a perennial favorite since its grandiose triumph in Prague in 1786, after nine performances in Vienna at its premiere; since those times Le Nozze remains part of the most popular repertoire.  There are many reasons for it.<br /><br />It's been four years since Mozart's breaking off with his abusive hereditary employer archbishop Colloredo in Salzburg, a character resembling in his feudal attitudes Il Conte Almaviva.  Mozart's arrival in Vienna then in 1782  was marked by the composition of his first opera as a freelance composer - Die Entf&uuml;hrung aus dem Serail, premiered in 1782 to a huge success.  By now, in 1786, Mozart was a well-established composer in Vienna, brimming with energy and creativity, very successful with instrumental works and concerts, but wishing again to astonish the public with a great opera made on a fashionable and somewhat scandalous subject regarding the conflict of aristocrasy and the others.  The French Revolution ideas are already circling over Paris, Vienna and progressive European capitals, the terrible uprising is only a few years away, but at the moment all the ruin, bloodshed and horrors are not foreseen, and the daring dangerous satire is extremely popular.  The Figaro  trilogy by Pierre-Augustin de Beaumarchais is now complete with the first two parts:  Le Barbier de S&eacute;ville ou la Pr&eacute;caution inutile (written in 1772, first performed in 1775) and Le mariage de Figaro, ou La folle journee (completed and first performed in 1784).  Both works were a great hit in Europe, and it was Mozart's idea to set the drama to music.  He handled the Beaumarchais play to Lorenzo da Ponte and the work on the libretto started.<br /><br />It is quite amazing that Mozart and da Ponte had decided to use as a base the material banned by Emperor - Joseph II has forbidden the play in Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, an opera was allowed to be done and performed!  Why did he do it?  There are a few explanations, all of which are not very convincing - including the one that the Emperor wanted to teach the nobility the political lesson that a servant can assert his rights against his master.  However, it seems that such liberal policies that allowed the mockery of the existing regime were exactly the reasons for the collapse of monarchies, starting with the Fremch Revolution, in which Joseph II's sister met an atrocious end.  Why were liberal monarchs, patrons of the arts, so short-sighted?  The questions remains an enigma, but the good thing is that Emperor's patronage made it possible for us enjoy this opera.<br /><br />Le Nozze had a predesessor - as mentioned, it is the second part of the Figaro trilogy; however the first part Le Barbier de S&eacute;ville was set to music by by Giovanni Paisiello to an opera  Il barbiere di Siviglia, ovvero La precauzione inutile (The Barber of Seville, or The Useless Precaution).  The opera was premiered in 1782  at the Imperial Court, Saint Petersburg.  It is curious to note that the same libretto was reused by Gioacchino Rossini for his masterpiece, in 1816, with then old Paisiello, having lost his position as a privileged court composer, witnessing such an irritating development.  Paisiello was born before Mozart - in 1740, and died long after the French Revolution and Mozart - in 1816, and one can only imagine what he must have had to say about all he had seen in his eventful life, which encompassed epochs from Louis XV to Napoleon, with Catherine the Great in between.<br /><br />Now, with a such a trail of an extremely rich history, what can be said of the performance in question?  Perhaps we can start with the good things - and to me, the conducting was an absolute perfection.  Nikolaus Harnoncourt followed the great tradition of Herbert von Karajan, and when listening to Karajan after this Harnoncourt, one can hear an unmistakable likeness in the approach:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000TEPM5U Mozart: Le Nozze di Figaro]]<br /><br />I love the tempi, the unhurried spirit, the phrasing and the pauses - Harnoncourt is very sensitive to give singers an opportunity to sing, and they do it so well until the overall stage direction interferes to ruin the great conducting.  But we still concentrate on the positives, so next plus will be again Harnoncourt's in-depth respect for the score - for example, both arias that are sometimes omitted in Act IV  (as they are in Karl Bohm's otherwise excellent interpretation [[ASIN:B0007P0LNO Mozart - Le Nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro)]]) are preserved - Marcellina's \\"Il capro e la capretta\\" and Basilio's \\"In quegli anni in cui val poco\\".  Regarding the latter, the story is even more interesting - a tenor sings this aria in this performance - Don Curzio/Oliver Ringelhahn; this must be a tribute to the first Basilio - an Irish tenor Michael Kelly, who sang both Basilio and Don Curzio at the premier in 1786.  Today Basilio is sung more by baritones, as is the case with this production, but the aria is preserved in its tenor appearance.<br /><br />About the performers - surely Anna Netrebko is the main focus here; she is in a perfect form and is a delight to watch and listen.  Yet Susanna has only one aria, and the role when it comes to pure singing is not as rich as the Countess; Netrebko is a great Susanna but the overall dull production does not let her shine to her fullest.<br /><br />Figaro (Ildebrando D'Arcangelo) is convincing in his singing, but again the ravages of the production dull his performance.  Hermann Prey had set a standard, with a cunning witty character, and a serious and slow-minded Figaro is not what can make an audience smile.<br /><br />Bo Skovhus is a good Count, he sings expertly - I saw him in Arabella in Wiener Staatsoper in March 2011, he was singing Mandryka, a role requiring the same type of voice, and also of a country aristocrat.  He was very good, but here as there his manner is somewhat reserved; the oddities of this production affected his performance in a negative way; in any case, I wish to see a swaggering, proud Count - then he is amusing in his miseries; but this image is just a hopeless loser, which is not too entertaining.<br /><br />Cherubino with Christine Shafer is marvelous, even if not too charming.  Her singing expiates for any flaws in appearance - that is, she is not a sweet and adorable young boy-doll with whom every lady wants to play.<br /><br />Now, the not so good points:<br /><br />The stage director found it necessary to introduce Ibsen and Strindberg into the libertine opera buffa.  What can possibly be a more lunatic idea?  The result is this giftless, wan and dull production, desperate to say something new and original, but coming out as dislocated and incongruent.  The most annoying Cupid truly ruins the great aria of the Count and the whole opera \\"Vedr&ograve; mentr'io sospiro\\" by all the acrobatic routine of a pest. The music which is actually written in the style of opera seria, an expression of aristocratic grandeur and hauteur, inspired Beethoven for his \\"Waldstein\\" sonata, dedicated to the Count von Waldstein.  But here it did not play to what it amasses - the singer Bo Skovhus spent some of his energy on that petty fight with Cupid, so irrational in this particular place, too - as the idea of the aria is not really an amoroso one, but of a general power of a lord over his subjects.  This is probably the most glaring example of the bad, pretentious production, which was looking for clues in a wrong place - why did they not look in Mozart, da Ponte and Beaumarchais contemporaries???<br /><br />The whole atmosphere of sensual innuendo, the naughty amusement, the funny mischief of the ambiguous libertine spirit of the time when the work was created and performed - all that is absent, mortified by Freud and Strindberg macabre shadows, and even the color palette of this spectacle is grey and blue, fleshless and withered.  It is an extremely serious opera, with no trace of goofy buffa, and it lacks the luster of a heartfelt comedy.<br /><br />Countess Almaviva here is an unattractive woman, which also simplifies the idea of a licentious libertine who gets bored from a prey already captured, no matter how beautiful or ugly.  I think a beautiful Countess, like Kiri te Kanawa, would be much more convincing.  Besides, Dorothea Roschmann has too much vibrato, although overall her singing is very good.<br /><br />The production put action accents in wrong places, too - the annoying adult awkward Cupid is all over in scenes where maximum attention needs to be called by the music itself, to the unbreakable concentration on the arias; but in a place where an action and a show is invited,  it was stunningly static!

Cherubino with Christine Shafer is marvelous, even if not too charming.  Her singing expiates for any flaws in appearance - that is, she is not a sweet and adorable young boy-doll with whom every lady wants to play.  Now, the not so good points:  The stage director found it necessary to introduce Ibsen and Strindberg into the libertine opera buffa.  What can possibly be a more lunatic idea?  The result is this giftless, wan and dull production, desperate to say something new and original, but coming out as dislocated and incongruent.  The most annoying Cupid truly ruins the great aria of the Count and the whole opera \\"Vedrò mentr'io sospiro\\" by all the acrobatic routine of a pest. The music which is actually written in the style of opera seria, an expression of aristocratic grandeur and hauteur, inspired Beethoven for his \\"Waldstein\\" sonata, dedicated to the Count von Waldstein.  But here it did not play to what it amasses - the singer Bo Skovhus spent some of his energy on that petty fight with Cupid, so irrational in this particular place, too - as the idea of the aria is not really an amoroso one, but of a general power of a lord over his subjects.  This is probably the most glaring example of the bad, pretentious production, which was looking for clues in a wrong place - why did they not look in Mozart, da Ponte and Beaumarchais contemporaries???  The whole atmosphere of sensual innuendo, the naughty amusement, the funny mischief of the ambiguous libertine spirit of the time when the work was created and performed - all that is absent, mortified by Freud and Strindberg macabre shadows, and even the color palette of this spectacle is grey and blue, fleshless and withered.  It is an extremely serious opera, with no trace of goofy buffa, and itlacks the luster of a heartfelt comedy.  Countess Almaviva here is an unattractive woman, which also simplifies the idea of a licentious libertine who gets bored from a prey already captured, no matter how beautiful or ugly.  I think a beautiful Countess, like Kiri te Kanawa, would be much more convincing.  Besides, Dorothea Roschmann has too much vibrato, although overall her singing is very good.  The production put action accents in wrong places, too - the annoying adult awkward Cupid is all over in scenes where maximum attention needs to be called by the music itself, to the unbreakable concentration on the arias; but in a place where an action and a show is invited,  it was stunningly static!

B00322PKAI|2.0|I DIDN'T BUY THIS WATCH ON AMAZON, BUT I WAS GIVEN ONE AS A GIFT.  THE HARD PLASTIC BAND IS CHEAPLY MADE.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE RIGHT FROM DAY ONE BECAUSE IT'S NOT VERY FLEXIBLE.  AND THEN THE ADJUSTABLE HOLES IN THE BAND STARTED CRACKING. A LOCAL JEWELER TOLD ME THAT HE COULDN'T REPLACE THE BAND WITH A REGULAR ONE DUE TO HOW THE COMPANY MADE THE CONNECTION FOR THE BAND.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  I'VE HAD IT ONLY SINCE OCT OF 2011, SO I'VE WORN IT JUST A BIT LONGER THAN 3 MONTHS.  NOW IT JUST SITS IN A DRAWER.
0451232577|5.0|I enjoyed Ken Follett's latest historical novel. No need for me to write a long review - in my case I listened to the story. One leaves the book with a much better understanding of the events of that time and how the world changed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my daughter and I love this app! she's 3 years old and can play a lot of the games. we love doing this together!

B003E6K1VK|5.0|Ground Noise: N/A<br /><br />Distortion: N/A<br /><br />I have sennheiser hd555s and 280 pros and this DAC beats the on board sound card of my (Beats laptop) by a dimension and is also much better than my TB sound-card which is an okay quality card, but this is amazing.<br /><br />One thing I recommend is that if your audio is in &lt;256 mp3 quality it may show all of the faults you have never heard before so rip your cds and use either a losses format or a high bit-rate mp3 like amazon mp3.
B0025KW29U|5.0|If you love the Whedonverse and all that it entails, you will love this movie. Filled with all the campy humor one could want and then some. Fillion, Day, and NPH have amazing onscreen chemistry, and I hope they do something together again soon.
B006PZBR8S|3.0|This movie was just ok.Every other word in this movie was I CAN,T , I CAN,T.... almost turned it off. I gave it three stars because the robots were cool. The cast over acted a bit.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Just downloaded this game. I like that it is User friendly. I would like more games like this.Would recommend to anyone who likes hidden object games.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I just finished this book on my kindle and have to say \\"It\\" was such a great read!! I wont go into detail of this book, I just wanted to give a short review praising this great story! This story takes you back to your childhood and the magic and wonder that we felt then, plus the worst of it as well. This book really shook the emotions forth as it deals with everything that can pass through a human being, but the magic, freindship and strength endure! Stephen King pegs down the essence of reality, magic and the unknown and the strength of friendship and childrens simple yet powerful belief in all. I hope that this helps anybody lingering on wheather it should be read. Two thumbs up!!! HI YO SILVER AWAYYYYYYYY!!!!!
B004LROUW2|4.0|Such a long read, so much detail on mundane everyday experiences, repetition of thoughts and scenes, jumps in reality that seem too readily accepted by the characters and an ending that leaves many of the plots arcs hanging, yeah that's the style of Haruki Murakami and it is a challenge to take on.  But if you will allow this book to settle into your reading it becomes an escape from those very things that make up our lives.  The things we daily lose significance of such as the pleasure of making a small meal for yourself with all the smells, tastes and touches of the process, the need to express how we feel to those who have made important impacts on our lives and the desire to stay grounded to what you believe to be right in the midst of a changing culture filled with difficulty, terror and incredibly hard choices of what is good and what is evil.  This is what a work of fiction does to a reader from the hand of a master of the genre and what it is meant to be at it's core.

B001TOD9VI|1.0|I thought I would like this movie, I really did. But it just drug on. I could not really make myself like any of the characters. I honestly wanted him to just die and have it be done with. Maybe it is because I am not a wrestling fan, but I didn't like it.

B0051UP5NQ|1.0|App is supposed to open Office docs.  Since it will not even open a .doc file, I consider it a total failure.  As an added bonus it caused my phone to lock up.
