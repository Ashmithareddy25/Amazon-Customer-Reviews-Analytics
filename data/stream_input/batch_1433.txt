B003VS0CX8|5.0|I recently purchased the Sound of Music for my eldest son.  He loves this movie and I wanted to purchase the blu-ray and the regualar dvd, even though I don't have a blu-ray yet.  I have purchased many dvd's from you and have always been satisfied.  I especially like the free shipping with a minimum purchase.  Please keep up the good work.  Sunny R.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|This book was great. It flowed well with the last book. The only issue I had with it is the ending! It is a cliff hanger and I don't get to read the next book until it is out in the Spring of 2013! Overall, good book.. just wish it gave more or that the last one was already out.

B001NLKT60|4.0|Of the trilogy...Books #1 and #3  are awesome.  Book #2 is just good but a must read to get to #3.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is very easy to find the scriptures. It can be used on or offline. It has many features too. Great. app!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Book #3 ties up all the loose ends in the trilogy.  It is an exciting read from cover to cover!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a very fun and addicting game. I can see how you would have to spend real money if you wanted to get everything but if you don't mind waiting a long time you may eventually do it free. For the most part you could probably just play free. It is easy cute and addictive.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a terrific book.  However, it is not a reading for a young teen due to a really graphic rape scene and lesbian sex. The sex, however, is just a part of a wonderful read. It helps you understand our heroine.
1846071224|5.0|This product is very well recorded. It will appeal to children of all ages. The songs are very catchy and well put together. If adults listen to it along with your child you will find yourself dancing and singing along with it. There are both old favourites as well as new songs on the disk. It really is worth the buy. Thanks again Amazon for a product that is worth the money.
B006XIR9KM|1.0|I noticed that after I installed there were a new &quot;camera&quot; and &quot;messenger&quot; icon added to my phone and neither is in my app list and can't be removed. Has this happened to anyone else? Didn't even try running this app, just uninstalled right away and am doing a hard reset this weekend.
B000IDEORY|5.0|It has been a LONG time since I've watched this movie, was delighted to see Amazon Prime has it now ... and what a treat it is!  I had forgotten so much -- the astonishing physicality and focus of Patrick Swayze, the terrific chemistry between him and Jennifer Grey, just how fantastic Jennifer Grey herself is in this movie, and the out-freakin-standing soundtrack. Every.single.song = Perfection. Even though I'm a lady I tend to like movies where stuff blows up (oh, Bruce Willis, be still my heart) so this is one of the very few romantic movies I really enjoy. Better yet and I can go back and watch my fave scenes whenever I want. Happy happy joy joy!
0385534639|5.0|I loved this book!  It is beautifully written, mysterious, and romantic.  It is not for those who want a plot-driven story.  It is a slowly told beautiful tale.
B004VMVTNU|3.0|I purchased this app for my son's kindle to help him start to get used to getting himself up to an alarm clock. Alarm is straight forward with limited tones, some of which would not wake the lightest of sleepers. I like the option to choose an app to launch for the alarm tone so he can wake to music but a pop-up tells you this is not a reliable option. This should be fixed especially in a product you pay for. Don't have the feature if you can't make it work. Often times the alarm would not launch the music app(Pandora). Also this alarm app will not wake up your Kindle when it goes off. You must press the on button, swipe to enter, enter your password, (if so protected) to get to the app to turn off the alarm. I got it to work by adding a clock app. Basicaly the Kindle has to be on all night for this app to work effectively as an alarm clock.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|after playing this game for two days now I will have to say its one of the best. and work great on my kindle fire. glue mobile you have done it again. I would. have paid for this one no problem!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Horrible! The writing is juvenile at best. With all the &#34;crap&#34; and &#34;double crap&#34; the story reads like a 14 year old girl decided one day she would try writing a romance novel, the chacters are shallow and the story leaves much to be desired. Atotal waste of time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Ned brothers really got it right with this on. got the blood flowing. thanks guys for the apt. cant wait for the next one!!!

The main characters are children and we are given enough information to identify with them. Even if we weren't like any of them ourselves, we almost certainly went to school with similar children.<br /><br />The movie feels like a combination of Stand by Me and some of the best Steven Spielberg stories, such as E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The story feels like it could have been written by Stephen King and contains a slice of small-town America, combined with a fantasy element.<br /><br />The opening scene mentions an accident at a steel mill in which Elizabeth Lamb is killed. Her husband, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), is a deputy, and her son, Joe (Joel Courtney), is helping his friends make a movie. We spend a lot of time with these children and events are seen from their viewpoint. The group enlists Alice (Elle Fanning) to play a role in their movie and she impresses them with her superior acting ability. Joe starts to develop feelings for her and it's this relationship which drives the story.<br /><br />One of the most memorable scenes comes early in the movie. While the kids are filming, a train approaches. Charles (Riley Griffiths), who is the director, wants to shoot a scene while the train is passing. A truck drives onto the tracks in front of the train and causes a massive accident. The scene is spectacular and will rock your home theater. After surviving the accident, the kids notice a carriage on its side and something is pounding on the walls from within.<br /><br />That's the setup and I don't think there's any need to ruin things by giving away any more of the story. Courtney and Fanning give strong performances and their developing friendship is believable. Alice's father is a source of conflict and Joe's father has a role to play in the safety of the town. Part of the fun is watching events unfold and trying to solve the mystery. What is causing these things to happen? Why are people and animals disappearing?<br /><br />Super 8 evokes a special feeling. It's partly nostalgia as we remember friendships in our childhood, and the movie feels as if it belongs in the 70s or early 80s. Technology wasn't as advanced as it is now and there is a closeness between the people in the town that is rare to see in today's world. The friendship between the children makes everything work and it feels authentic.<br /><br />Although the early part of the movie relies on special effects, there is a real story here with a little depth. If you like Spielberg's classic movies, you'll probably enjoy what Abrams has done. If you were wondering whether Abrams includes lens flares like he did in Star Trek, they are present throughout the movie.s from within.<br /><br />That's the setup and I don't think there's any need to ruin things by giving away any more of the story.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is really an amazing cooler. Yes it is big, but if you are going to overclock than a great cooler is a must. I could not put the stock fan on the right side. I had to put it on the back of the cooler and let it pull air. If you buy this fan I would recommend getting a 120x20mm fan. This WILL fit on the right side of the cooler. Than you can have a push/pull configuration!<br /><br />I recommend a Yate Loon 120x20mm fan. Works great and fits with the large heatsink ram.
1401937519|3.0|I found so many parts of this book exquisitely beautiful and incredibly powerful.  I believe much of this book Anita wrote straight from her heart in the hope that it would touch others and help them find some type of healing be it emotional or as we can all hope for, physical.  There were so many moments that I sat back and just absorbed the truth of the parts that rang so true for me.  Then she gets into this whole business of \\"allowing\\".  I like that she does not go down the path of 'attraction' magic as we've heard before and which did not sit well with me at all.  But the one part I find contradicting and I am skeptical of is that we 'allow' bad things to come into our life.  Not to say, Anita does explain beautifuly that negativity does not 'necessarily' attract negative things and that allowing yourself to feel negative thoughts it an act of self love, and in my opinion, perfectly normal and healthy.  But then when she talks about allowing and aligning yourself with the energy of the universe I get lost.  So what I want is truly mine but I have to let go of needing it.  Anita does not go into detail about how to let go of attachement to this need.  I'm also skeptical of the idea that we are responsible for everything we allow into our lives.  Will this not just create more self-judgment and fear and paranoia that anything \\"bad\\" that manifests in our lives is somehow there because we have allowed it or have not learned to 'align' ourselves with the universal energy - whatever that means to you.  I wish some of the book was more down-to-earth and not so abstract.  Maybe some things we can only 'know' when we experience them, not read about them.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding, maybe I'm right but either way, I think people should be careful and not buy into any new way of thinking unless it feels right to them.  The other thing that really makes me skeptical is Anita's connection to Wayne Dyer.  Everything I read and hear from this man oozes with \\"me, my book, I am this, me, me, God, me\\" and judging by his past and even present, he doesn't seem to be someone I would like to model my life by.  I think it's interesting and hopefully healing to read such books but the moment you feel like you're not getting it in your life and it's not working for you because you're not following someone's theory, I think it's time to re-examine what is really being said before we blame ourselves for our failures or our health.  Oh ya and one last unanswered question, why do infants and children get cancer?  It cannot be because they are blocking their magnificence.  They are some of the most beautiful perfect beings to grace our planet.  I can't accept that they are doing anything \\"wrong\\".  Just my thoughts.  I would love to hear others ideas.
0897500482|5.0|Tao of Jeet Kune Do is essential for everyone upon whos life Bruce Lee made an impact, as well as for the serious martial artist beginner and advanced. Bruce Lee wrote the body of this book when he was bed ridden for 6 months from back injury. it is his martial art, Jeet kune do, as a whole-the art, the physical, the mindset, the soul. Bruce Lee recorded his views on attitude, conduct, mindset, balance, coordination, endurance, exercises, stance, and some effective body tools-strikes, etc. it is not a how to guide, but a collective of what makes up Jeet Kune Do as the ultimate martial art. simplistic, direct, fast. if you want to know Bruce Lee the martial artist, get this and Bruce Lee's Fighting method:the ultimate edition. weather you are new to martial arts or a seasoned fighter looking to broaden his/her martial horizons, or you just love everyting Bruce Lee, Tao of Jeet Kune Do is MANDATORY: call it the Bruce lee study bible, if you will. 5 stars.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|the game was really fun at first. when i was done playing the first time, i closed the app and did other stuff. the next day i went to play again and it wouldnt let me hit start game. i closed it and tried to reopen it and it wouldnt open. then my phone crashed and shut off completly, and i had full battery. i deleted it....
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I think this game is fun if you like defence games I think you will love this game it is better if you put real money into buying stuff
B002R5QPRI|5.0|Love this story.....have watched it at least 25 times.  Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston....two<br />wonderful additions to this absolutely wonderful movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love playing. once I start I find that I just about lose track of time.  To me is a very fast paced farmville style game.
B005AEQX0C|5.0|The sophomore album from The Wanted, which personally I like even more than their debut, largely due to the presence of that platinum certified first song:<br /><br />1. Glad You Came-that awesome dance song that I've pretty much had on repeat since first hearing. Although it was released last year in the UK, I only heard it this year and I fully anticipate it being my song of the summer...unless The Wanted's \\"Chasing the Sun\\" takes that spot.<br /><br />2. Lightning-another fun song featuring what is now my second-favorite rhyme of \\"fright'ning\\" with \\"lightning\\"; perhaps that is also because of their accents...The music video is quite good too although it could have been better with some BMX tricksters ;)<br /><br />3. Warzone-this is a song about being cheated on but I still find it overwrought. Musically it's cool, incorporating dubstep elements and I do love this lyric \\"It's clear to me the lies you use/The ones that kill me ain't hurting you.\\"<br /><br />4. Invincible-this one sort of reminds me of (a quieter) \\"Glad You Came\\" and \\"I like it like that/Yeah I like it like that\\"<br /><br />5. Last to Know-I waver on this song. On the one hand, it's not really a dance song which is the music I tend to like. But on the other hand it does remind me of my favorite The Four Seasons song \\"Opus 17 (Don't You Worry About Me)\\" where the male singer encourages the girl to leave him if that's what's best for her. So there's that.<br /><br />6. I'll Be Your Strength-this song works best for me when I sit back and allow myself to fangirl over the guys and their promise \\"to make it through the stormy weather\\" with me.<br /><br />7. Rocket-a soaring, dare I say, anthemic song; while slow at the start, it does pick up speed through the choruses.<br /><br />8. I Want It All-really doesn't work for me. This one is much quieter than the other songs with just guitar accompanying the guys. I can still listen to it but I do prefer the more upbeat songs.<br /><br />9. The Weekend-another club song, this reminds me very strongly of \\"Glad You Came\\" with cheesier lyrics (\\"I'll make you sweat like you've worked out\\" cracks me up!)<br /><br />10. Lie To Me-really a standout track for me. The more I listen to it, the more it works for me. Definitely rivals \\"Glad You Came\\" in listenability for me.<br /><br />11. Gold Forever-this single was recorded for Comic Relief and feels kind of tacked on to the end. I don't feel it flows well from \\"Lie to Me\\" although it is a perfectly enjoyable song in its own right. Definitely check out the fun video when you can.<br /><br />Overall, my biggest complaint would be that this album is too short-I want more and will definitely be a fan of The Wanted for a good long time!r club song, this reminds me very strongly of \\"Glad You Came\\" with cheesier lyrics (\\"I'll make you sweat like you've worked out\\" cracks me up!)<br /><br />10.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|My son and I both love this game.<br /><br />My son and I love this game.  There are so many different parts to it but it is simple enough for a child to understand.
B0055SWM08|5.0|challenging but not frenzied - almost relaxing. you can play for a minute or an hour - but you'll likely find time slips away while you're in the game!
B000068CNX|5.0|This season is even better than the first, they really pull together and work well together to make a great show, so happy I bought it.
B007WBRL48|5.0|Supernatural has had its ups and downs in recent seasons both in stand-alone episodes and in longer arcs. Of Grave Importance does well on both fronts and reminds viewers why they loved Supernatural in the first place.<br /><br />Bobby is dead. We last saw him about to make the final decision about whether to go with his Reaper or not and as we haven't seen him since, both we and Sam and Dean assume that he did go with his Reaper. Think again. Meanwhile, another hunter is investigating a haunted house where teenagers keep going missing. She calls Sam and Dean and arranges to meet to return some things of Bobby's. She never shows up. The episode follows the nasty haunting and Bobby's attempts to get in contact with the boys. It seems that ghosts have to learn their trade the same as anyone else.<br /><br />Well-written, well acted and interesting, this is a classic episode of Supernatural and sets the stage for more drama to come between Bobby and the boys. Recommended to all fans of Supernatural.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has been very helpful and it's easy to use. I can find out what the weather's going to be like for the day or the next couple days. I also like that you can chose what locations you want information on. You can check the weather across theworld at any time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun but just. like farmville in every way shape and form just with different characters. you extend land complete task and everything else
B004EPYZUS|2.0|I really don't like where the Mission Impossible movies are going.  It appears to be mostly a format to show off Tom Cruise.  They even had  a scene when the did the famous Tom C.  fall with the arms at the side.  It just wasn't Tom's character this time.  They need to focus less on Ethan and more on the other characters.  The strength of the original series was the whole crew not just Mister Phelps.  Better scripts less toys.  Oh almost forgot.  I really hate to turn my entire brain off in a movie.  That scene where the show the giant fan for cooling the servers is so much BS.  They would never have one big fan to cool electronics.  They'd have a bunch of little ones.  To me that was like the movie I saw as a kid called Tom Horn.  It was suppose to be in either 19th century or early 20th century Africa and in one scene I saw a 1960's Chevy Impala in the back ground and Jet con trails too.  That is how lame that was for me.  Unless they change something this is my last I.M force movie.  I am only glad I did not waste my money on the DVD and just watched it on Pay Per view.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|I'm in the USA and just ordered the BBC VERSION of this series. I tried to watch the US version on the Green Planet cable channel but Oprah's narration is horrid. Boring, slow unfeeling readings. I very much prefer the excitement and joy of David A's voice as he shares his passion with us. Like the other reviewers have said, enjoy the BBC version!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed the first one, LOVED the second!! My 15yr old son even reading trilogy- (literally) FIRST TIME for everything!! Get kindle edition if u can...just easier to read in the dark so u won't wake-up ur wife while ur reading in bed because u can't stop reading it...haha!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely love this app. Yes, it is true that you have to shut down your Kindle to exit. But this game will keep you occupied for a long time, so its not like you are constantly shutting it down. This game is soo fun and addicting! I strongly reccomend. :)
B003TWONOK|5.0|Brilliant Suspense , couldnt leave it down,characters come to life in this book,gives you an indept view of search and rescue
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Addicting, controls well, tons of content, and tons of fun. Even if you dislike golf you'd be surprised at how much you like this game. Blows angry birds out of the water.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Interesting premise to this game. Not an &quot;action&quot; game by any means, but still pretty cool. Not like anything I've ever played, more of a low key thinking persons game...
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Were to begin.... I'm a die hard fan of all romance novels. The thing is the first three chapters are tough to get through because it felt like reading a paper written by a highschool student. I had to control the urge to edit.  The characters are a little unbelievable but thats expected from a romance novel. Its suppose to be fantasty. If you can get use to the overdone adjectives and  get to chapter 7 things heat up significantly. If you like soft S/M then the rest of the book is a breeze. Plus the author uses amusing emails to take you from titillating scene to titillating erotic scene.  Overall.... its okay. I may read the next book because I want to see how they resolve they issues.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I like this game but the thing I don't like about this game is if you tip someone one and you don't tip for 5 days it will make your rating from 3 to 1 and the money is way too much if you want to expand its wayyyyy too much.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am not like some readers that need to dive in to every aspect from every corner of every book and share quite frankly entirely too much. After all, most want an overall idea of whether a book is good enough to invest money and time in to and if a romance novel..if it is romantic enough with some depth and lets face it, I like some naughty steamy scenes. If I want a no-naughty scene, I would buy YA books.<br />E L James is in her own right. Lets just say I needed a fan, many cigarettes and glasses of wine during BOOK ONE. BOOK TWO..same thing. I give it 5 STEAMIES. HOT HOT HOT. However, be warned..this is mentally very heavy. Its about a young guy, Christian, in his late twenties with baggage the size of NYC and it mentally enthralls you in to his very twisted world that was a product of being abandoned as a toddler. However, he tries to improve his life and so mch of this book as well as BOK ONE, is about his journey and teh changes in his journey as he falls deeper for Anastasia. Its very HEADY. Mix it with the love he has with Anaastasia and his internal struggles..it really is a wild ride. There are sweet tender moments in it well..so it has some balance. The sex scenes..OY! HOT! FAN, and I NEED A CIGARETTE HOT! and A LOT OF IT. My husband benefits from this series too :-D! Thanks EL James for an incrediblely deep book with so much range of every emotion a human being can have (and you give great sex...scenes!)
B00631HASU|5.0|I like the way the game keeps your blood pumping.  Very intriguing and keeps you guessing what it will do next. I started playing and forgot the time.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|I almost didn't watch this movie based upon a critic's review who found the movie \\"fundamentally dishonest weepie\\".  My wife was interested in watching it so we did.  I believe this director is innocent of that  critic's charge.  The content of the film presents such honest & vulnerable relationships that a cynical heart cries foul.  This defense mechanism dulls the pain of human longing.  it also precludes us from fulfilling our need for attachment with our maker and with other people.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I had fun playing this game you guys should try it that animal is crazy about his nuts lmao I can play this game all day
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My son talked me in to reading The Hunger Games and I loved it.  Can't wait to read the next one...
B00139W3NE|3.0|This was a very daring children`s movie in a way. You will have to see it first parents and decide for yourselfs ahead of time. Especially if you are Christian. Plant Earth being relative to the movie world; the word demon carries such strongly negative contonotations. Besides that however, it is as good as any children`s movie, with some cool special effects.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|ya I love this game its awesome cant stop playing it I am adiccted to this game get it its so worth it
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Finally, Shinedown is back.  What an amazing cd!  It's a great mix of music, and I haven't been able to stop listening to it.  I've been hooked on this band since Sound of Madness, and this CD does not disappoint.  I highly recommend this cd.
0141185228|5.0|This book is a classic for a reason.  The work-a-day lives of individuals in a small southern town are tenderly related to us, with all of their egos, inadequacies, (perceived and otherwise) are laid bare to our eyes.  We watch as a young mind finds strange new feelings emerging, which seek a focal point for the developing affections.  We watch as a husband-wife pair slowly circles a sink-hole of desperation, and an old man combats the growing realization of his own inconsequence.  Such is life.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very good and enjoyable read. I think the charaters are wonderful and likable. I feel some people might be turned off by the context of some of the situations that do happen, but the story of these two people are great.
0920668372|5.0|There has not been one time I have ever read this book that a lump doesn't appear in my throat. When I read it to my girls after my mother passed away I broke completely down. This book just grabs your heart from the moment you begin it and all the parental/child love you have in your body relates to every word. Beautifully written and illustrated. One of the best stories I have ever read.
B003ZJJHWK|5.0|Reviewing an album by Antony and the Johnsons one assumes one is preaching to the choir. No one is going to be galvanized by Antony's voice out of the verbal persuasion to be found in a blurb like this. You love this artist or you hate him. That said, I think this is Antony at his most extraordinary and also at his most stylized and mannered. In the main, \\"Swanlights\\" is a CD of superb artistry -- from simple guitar accompaniment to full orchestration -- ie-- the London Symphony and the Danish National Orchestra make an appearance here to round out the production.<br /><br />Antony is a brilliant artist with a wholly unique voice, an unassailable persona, and with acceptance in an international art world that works across platforms -- meaning Antony winds up collaborating with the likes of Nico Muhly, one of the leading young composers of the postmodern avant garde, and Bjork; he's also collaborated with Laurie Anderson (although not on this CD). Antony, this creature of the winds of cultural change, can't lose, and why should s/he? If indeed there is a paradigmatic shift underway, Antony could be seen as the drum majorette at the head of the swarm -- a key to our evolution as a band of brothers and sisters.<br /><br />As for the music in \\"Swanlights\\", it oscillates from moments of haunting genius, with all its depth and mystery in shimmering evidence, particularly in the piece \\"Swanlights\\" itself. It's just perfect. Not every piece is loaded with this much luminosity and so what is less than perfect, can seem a trifle disappointing, but the disappointment doesn't last. As a listener and a thinker, you want to be on a very high level of alertness when engaging with this CD, just so you don't miss any nuance.<br /><br />Having Antony come down to earth -- or should I say, come down to the underworld -- and sing about death in the most poignant, plaintiff way in \\"The Spirit Was Gone\\", is a necessary heartbreaking antidote to the illusion of transcendence. There are many moods between these two particular songs -- \\"Swanlights\\" and \\"The Spirit Was Gone\\"-- and if you're a fan of Antony, you'll find catharsis somewhere in between these two musical catalytic converters. The last song loops you back to the beginning in one ghostly arc of longing, so let yourself go, let yourself long for the unattainable...ny moods between these two particular songs -- \\"Swanlights\\" and \\"The Spirit Was Gone\\"-- and if you're a fan of Antony, you'll find catharsis somewhere in between these two musical catalytic converters.

B0063GORYU|4.0|Spider is totally addictive. I have to admit you would want to beat your best time with every game. Great for a spare moment.
B003CYKCHW|5.0|I love everything about this mouse. The price was right when I got it and I always wanted to snag one of the R.A.T series mice for their features and style. The software is a very powerful tool that lets you program your mouse to basically do whatever you want it to do. It is very comfortable to the hand and it's mousing is very smooth. If your looking for a great mouse to boost your gaming experience, go for a R.A.T
B007SYWFRM|5.0|if u like this game u would like the game called tiny village but anyway its a good game I guess but it wont let me get out of the app!

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great note tool.  clipping is awesome and phone widget makes photo notes super simple. premium adds a lot of value, but try free first.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I had a lot of fun with this. The controls are a little weird at first but they get better with time and upgrades. If you like tower defense or strategy games then try this out. It's worth the download.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a great time killer &amp; you can always get points.  I didn't have any trouble downloading on my Kindle Fire &amp; graphics are bright &amp; ckear.  Overall I lime it!!!!
B004PGNB1K|4.0|Many of the reviews to date have been a tad harsh. But disappointment is very commnon with high expectations. I am enjoying the evolving character of Kvothe. I would have to concur with the (*spoiler alert*) reviews that find the Felurian tangent somewhat of a mess. I got annoyed that I skimmed/speed read much of it as it was too long winded and distracting. I am however enjoying the journeyman themes. Consistent with many fantasy adventures.
0345803485|1.0|This is probably one of the worst books I've ever read.  All of the other bad reviews have completely nailed the problems with this book; shallow, poorly written, repetitive and boring.  If I had a daughter I'd be very disturbed if she loved this book.  A 21 year virgin is seduced and abused by an older man?  She sighs, she gasps, she blushes, does she have a brain?  What century are we in?  Is there a money back guarantee from itunes if you hate the book?  It's too bad this is the only review I've ever done, in the future I will review all the great books that I have read.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I played this game on my phone and kindle fire and it was good and all. But I could not get out. I offer you not to buy it!

B004MDLSO8|2.0|Bought it because my daughter is reading it in school, and wanted it with the audio link so we could listen in the car.  However, we could not figure out how to get the audio link to work.<br />Disappointing.
1439192812|1.0|an illustrated initiation into naturalism by Dr. Dick himself.<br /><br />I wonder what \\"we\\" in the title means.

B0059XTTW8|1.0|A movie with a very disjointed plot, no character development, poor cinemetography with some pointless scenes unconnected in any way to the minimal story line.  Throw in an unnecessary scene of an innocent woman shot through the head while breastfeeding her baby, and you have the worst movie I've seen since Ishtar.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A truly brilliant book about a truly brilliant man. Neither patronising nor tale telling, it gives the whole story. He wasn't afraid to stand out from the crowd and was the driving force behind the reason we all want to own an i-something. A great read.
B0068MNO4S|3.0|I enjoyed this movie. I can't speak to the historical accuracy, but it was defiantly an interesting take on Shakespeare. Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't do the film justice. The image quality is rather poor, especially in dark scenes. At the beginning of the movie, I actually thought there was something wrong with my player. Remember when DVDs actually looked good? Those were the days....
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Ill make this Review simple. For Reference, My Rig is at the bottom of this review.<br /><br />My cpu Temp before installation and with overclocking was at 42*c-44*c Right after installation it was 25-28*c, now it is running generally at 31-33*c  so it did work well, my fan setup is still poor, so I expect when i create a better airflow, it will go lower expectidly another 5*c.<br />  Here are a few things in mind after reading other reviews. If your case dosent give u big enough access to the rear of the cpu. Or even if it does. Installation is a breeze when you take the mother board out. If someone took it out and still had trouble, than they should have paid for it to be done anyway. Also, yes it is very large, 120mm-140mm high I think(dont quote me on that) and with two fans its almost as wide. If your purchasing this I would expect you to have a gaming computer or a tower that is upgrade. Because if you dont, you can and should lower the temp of your pc by getting better air flow in your pc for example a gaming tower. If im wrong in saying that, than you should at least obtain measurments of this cooler and see if it fits first, Its fully effeciant with 2 fans, so when you measure it, take in consideration the second fan is sold seperately and should be purchased. otherwise whats the point. My biggest complaint and the only reason I gave this product 4 stars is that I dont believe they should sell this without a second fan.<br /><br />Shipping was very quick by the way. Great Buy.<br />M Buy Computer rig below that benefited from this Great Buy. (most of everything purchased thru amazon. No problems other than shipping on Sat using next day.

B007FDE4Y8|5.0|I've seen some reviews here where the Opteka is compared to the Steadicam Merlin. I am actually that fortunate that i have been able to work with both of these steadycams the last few days. From reading the reviews here I was given the impression that these two steadycams are equally good. They are not equally good, but the thing you should take into account is the fact that one is about 4 times more expensice thant the other. The really big plus on the Merlins side is the extremely good gimbal - Optekas \\"gimbal\\" doesn't even come close, it has got a few big faults. Here's my impressions on the Opteka:    Pros:  Good steadycam with a good build quality, it really doesn't feel or look cheep  Gets you steady shots for a good price.  Has an integrated bubblelevel.  Great and comfortable handle - this is important when you are going to hold it for a few hours  Verry similar to the merlin in the stabilizing prosess, it takes a bit of time, but once you've got the hang of it you can rig it in a 60 seconds!    Cons:  Tends to pan to the right whan you tilt the handle to the right and visa versa  Gimbal not as smooth as the Merlin  When stabilizing some setups, my experience is that the opteka tends to get slightly heavyer.    All in all I would say that for my use, which is freelance and semi pro work, the opteka does a good job, i would probably get slightly better shots with the merlin, but for me the expence is to much. I would buy this product again and definatly recommend it! I give it five stars because of the price and the good build quality!    Here is a video shot with both the Opteka steadivid and the Merlin!  [...]
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This STAR TREK movie was awesome!!!!!!!!! Extremely exciting from start to the end. I can't wait for the next STAR TREK movie to come out.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|land i think is to exspensive it should be at a lower price like around two thousand coins or 10 acorns
B00006G8HX|3.0|Pretty exciting, and interesting movie. I recommend any TREK fan to watch this movie. Its important to know the past of STAR TREK, because it has just been rewritten.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I loved reading this book.  It is a romantic mystery/romantic thriller.  It jumps back in forth in time in a similar way to The Forgotten Garden which I also enjoyed but I think I liked this book a little better!  Great read!  Some of the mysteries I figured out but some I didn't which made it a fun read.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|So awesome how the Enterprise traveled back in time, to stop the BORG from taking over EARTH in the past. I recommend watching this movies TREK fans.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|angry birds is so freaking awesome if there wasn't a free version I would be so sad works great on kindle fire
B000083C49|5.0|This movie was well done. Its funny seeing how everyone tried to blend in the 80s. This movie is worth watching. I recommend all TREK fans to watch this awesome film.
B006T3RM08|5.0|Long story short, the problems referenced in the other reviews about the trackpad sticking are fixed.  Great product and I am very happy with the purchase.<br /><br />I spent a while looking at similar solutions, and this one seemed like the best.  You can use trackpad anywhere since the buttons/feet for the trackpad are supported by the base of the Clique.  You also have easy access to both power buttons using the slide-button on the underside of the Clique to hit the power button for the keyboard.  My only reservation when ordering this was that previous reviews said there is a problem with the trackpad sticking in place and being unusable for clicking - I am happy to report that either through changes to the Clique or the Magic Trackpad, this is no longer a problem.  I am using the trackpad clicking (not the tap to click, but actually pushing to trackpad down) without problems.  This product does exactly what I wanted, so I am more than happy with my purchase and recommend this to all Apple wireless keyboard and magic trackpad users who want to combine them into a single, mobile solution.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|wondered what all the fuss was about so I decided to read the book.  Loved it so much that I bought the other 2.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the story.  When I started reading it I couldn't stop. So glad I bought the trilogy and not each individual book.  That saved my sanity.
0545265355|5.0|It is especially convenient to have all three books of this series boxed together. I read them one after another and really enjoyed the series. Great author, unique story plot, and captivating, easy reading. I recommend the series even to people who don't typically read science fiction types of books. Although not as unique as the Harry Potter series, these stories are excellent and well written.[[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]]
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I cant get to my home screen on my kindle fire .SO anoying.but other than that its good.if you like tap tap games( i don't went to say names)this is the app for you
0345803485|5.0|I adored the romantic Love pursuit. I am not a teenager but very young at heart and a true romantic. I am not into kinky sex but was intrigued by Christian's desires and needs and blown away by Anastasia's...I. have 3 grown sons but I adore all love stories like Twilight and Vampire Diaries. If you are not a true romantic, this is not for you. For me, it has possessed me until I read the whole trilogy and now, I cannot wait to reread all 3. The last chapter in the trilogy was perfection as I love what people are thinking. For those who love detail...The emails between Ana and Christian are amazing..I was devastated at the ending in Book 1 and so Book 2 began 5 seconds later...Would so love a Book 4....10 stars from a devoted fan!!!!
2070360024|2.0|The books is a classic, wonderful read as always. My problem is that the \\"Look Inside\\" on Amazon's page makes it seems as though this edition includes an introduction (in English) as well as a guide to understanding some of the French phrases. The edition I received today had none of this. It is, very simply, the original French text. No additional material. Just a heads up.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is like the old Mario this is fun and easy. the kids really like this game to play. it makes a fun time for family time all day and night.
B00190N4E4|5.0|GANDHI<br /><br />The film \\"Gandhi\\" begins at the end, however, and shows Gandhi being shot by an assassin at a public event. This is followed by a scene with thousands of mourners, making it clear that when Gandhi died it was a national tragedy. He is riding on a train and although he possesses a first-class ticket he is ordered to go to third-class because of his status as a minority. He refuses and is thrown off the train. This is the first in a series of non-violent attempts at protest Gandhi makes throughout the film. After this, Gandhi is even more inspired to create equality and bring an end to racial oppression. After having some success in South Africa bringing about change he returns to India where he is greeted as a national hero. He attempts to bring the same kind of change to the people there but meets a number of challenges as the British authority tries to prevent him and his followers from creating a more equal society.<br />In the film, Gandhi is repeatedly jailed and grows increasingly frustrated as violence on both sides escalates. He eventually goes on a hunger strike after a brutal mass murder of peaceful Indian protestors and does again after witnessing the struggles between the Hindus and Muslims. This is one of the most intense scenes in the field as the director chose to show almost five full minutes of Indian civilians, many of them Indian women and children, being gunned down by a firing squad comprised of what appears to be Chinese or East Asian mercenary troops. The brutality of this scene in \\"Gandhi\\" is even further revealed when the lieutenant in charge of the act coldly defends his decision to fire and keep firing until over one thousand people were dead. Gandhi's reaction is one of great sorrow and this event marks a turning point in the film.<br />In the movie the Hindu religion was depicted as a strong devotion to ones beliefs. Religion was not only a belief but a way of life, not only something that is faith filled but makes up who you are.<br />Gandhi was a strong willed man of peaceful ways and devotion to his beliefs and religious ways. He possessed such a strong devotion, faith filled belief in his way of life that was admiring.<br />All through his life Gandhi devoted much time and energy for the promotion of Hindu Muslim unity and also fasted for his cause on many occasions. In the wake of the partition of the country, hundreds and thousands of Hindus and Muslims were killed. Gandhi threw himself into a struggle to heal the breach between the two communities. Gandhi wanted communal harmony and peace not only between the Hindus and the Muslims but between all sections of the people who believe India to be their home, no matter to what faith they may belong.<br />`'Every religion was connected with some belief system supported by rituals.''<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00190N4E4 Gandhi]]
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Definite time waster&hellip;fun for most ages. Cant jump on the red dinasors or what ever they are. I would say for ages 12 and up just because of the difficulty but fun on Kindle Fire!
B006MHWXMS|5.0|so far this is the best app I've used that syncs with Google calendar's tasks. works well on kindle fire but is sometimes buggy on my phone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book. It might be the best if the series!! Def a must read series! I can't wait for the other movies!!
1439156816|5.0|After years of reading King's spooky work, I fell upon this non-fiction piece that I couldn't put down.  Well written, concise, no overdose of funny material, but funny moments nonetheless; and much to my surprise, this book was the best pizza I had embellished in one sitting.  Kudos Mr. King.  I feel a re-read sneaking up.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's very fun and you get to play with all your favorite Ice age characters. Ice age village is great!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is awesome to build cities using the ice age characters . it makes you feel like the mayor of your own little city.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a very addictive game, so prepare to lose a good portion of your day! There is only one reason it does not rate 5 stars, the Pop-up adds!!! They slow the game down on all the android devices I have used this version on. If you can afford it, buy the add free version!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|\\"Suzanne Collins is a horrible person,\\" was running through my mind as I cried through the last chapters of Mockingjay. -- I really don't think Suzanne Collins is horrible.  The fact was I had to keep dabbing my eyes and it really slowed me down!<br /><br />One of my students told me she didn't like the ending of the series and I disagreed.  It seemed appropriate to me.  It wasn't a convenient wrap-up, it was a thoughtful and thought-provoking conculsion to a complex tale. I read a fair number of young adult novels as I teach a class for future teachers but I don't often read ones as good as these. I was truly moved by these novels.  The closest rival in quality to the [[ASIN:B005EGXTEE The Hunger Games (Hunger Games Trilogy)]] is Lois Lowry's [[ASIN:B004V2AWKG The Giver Publisher: Delacorte Books for Young Readers]]. Like The Giver, The Hunger Games trilogy is worth reading.<br /><br />A reader might see these three facinating novels as mere allegory, but if you let them you will see they represent so many of the realaties of the media, government, war and peace.  I think the greatest value of this series is that it allows you to consider these aspects of the human experience.  Maybe those who read these books will be the people who take its messages into their own lives to make our world a more compassionate place for us to live.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|I really like the pace of this game. It keeps you on your toes and always throws you a curve ball with the moving tiles. Good job Retro Dreamer!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Enough has been written about this book on the surface. I think the more intriguing issue is how Katniss relates, or not, to the men who populate her world. Her capacity for self deception and inability to acknowledge feelings of dependency and need are matched only by her duplicity and incapacity to commit to a person, idea or course of action. She seems to only clearly relate to people who are, or have become, dependant on her, and then she smolders with scarcely concealed resentment. Since the series has caught fire in almost all demographics, especially young girls, one wonders if it is emblematic of a global gestalt. Not likely that this book will be deconstructed soon as too much personal investment is going on at all levels. Still, it was an interesting and gripping tale.
B00126J6HE|5.0|Buy it. Now. Don't look away. Click buy now, your passing up something that you will most likely never see again! NO!! Sorry, great album, rare because the blue vinyl was put out as a tribute to Elvis, this one was on shelves for a very short time (because he died shortly after the release of this album), and very few were put out because of that, the blue was a neat, but very common sight, which makes this very rare, and very valuable, depending on the condition.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Mario Bros .... great game easy to play for all ages :) very simple controls make this game easy to play. game has a retro familiar feeling which makes it a family favorite quickly.
B00004T0US|5.0|This was one of his greatest (not to mention last). I of course have the blue vinyl original, but that's because I'm a cool kid. But this is overall an awesome album. My favourite's definately \\"Unchained Melody\\", but I'm also a movie theme fanatic, so that goes without saying, but if your an album collector, this is one you won't wanna pass by. Thank you, thank you very much.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I could not put down The Orphan Master's Son.  It is a compelling story of one man's life in North Korea, from orphan to spy to prisoner in a labor camp, and, finally, as an impostor in the regime.  It makes us question how much is real and how much is fiction, concocted by the author's imagination.  Regardless, it was a book I could not stop reading, leading to many late nights and sleepy mornings!
B001EKP5FK|4.0|I had been searching all over Perth, WA (Australia) for \\"The Prince of Tides\\" on DVD but to no avail. Then I came across your website - yahoo!! and three movies for the price I paid was insane! sadly the two other disks \\"the Mirror has two faces\\" and \\"The way we were\\" arent readable on my player but Im stoked I finally got the copy of the movie I was really chasing in the first place. Thank you Amazon, I will be back.
0307577589|5.0|This was very enjoyable and i thought the narrator did a perfect job.  Narrators can make or break an audio book, imo, so i was glad he did such a good job reading it.  Good story, can't wait to listen to the next one!  A+
B00782O7IY|1.0|This movie itself, is fantastic. Totally deserves best picture. I'm receiving harsh criticism for this, as if every item by extension of a movie deserves the same rating as the movie itself. That is actually NOT what amazon reviews. Amazon is designed to review PRODUCTS and this product is false marketing. If you want to see a movie review, look on a movie reviewing website such as rottentomatoes, or most of the other reviews on here that are using amazon incorrectly.<br /><br />This rating is mainly for the false marketing of this product calling the ultraviolet a \\"digital copy\\". While it does share the definition of a lack of physical media, a digital copy is usually in the form of a code or a disc that contains transferable data, which is then saved on your electronic device of your choosing. Ultraviolet on the other hand, is nothing more than a promise that some website wont ever go down, that uploads media per use on your device, and then locks your capabilities of watching said media if you are not connected to the internet/said website.<br /><br />In a nutshell, digital copies are a good thing and ultraviolet is a bad thing. The first lets you download and keep your content. The second takes it away if you don't let a company monitor you for piracy.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my kids (grlz 8&amp;10) LOVE this game!!  perfect for spending a lot of time on or in short bursts. smooth play.  graphics load well.  recommend for any ice age fans especially :D

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am so baffled by the attention and great reviews that this book is getting that I don't even know where to start. I had heard so much about it that I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire and was so disappointed with the writing that I really couldn't stand to read the whole story.  I kept going back to it, thinking that I might be missing something, but it just got more and more laborous to read, so I finally just skimmed the last 20% of the book and removed it from my device.  What the heck is going on in people's minds that this is getting so much critical acclaim?  The author is so repetitious and I can't understand why everyone in the story is \\"murmuring\\".  Is that her favorite word?  And all the comments about his long fingers, and all the \\"Oh my's!\\" are just ridiculous!  And how many times do we need to hear about the pants he is wearing and how they hang on his hips?  And really, ladies, are we all regressing so much that we want to be dominated by men like this?  Not that I didn't know what the subject matter was before I bought it, but I thought it was going to be some kind of psychological insight into why some women have this kind of an \\"issue\\" (and the man, too); certainly not that a big percentage of the population was actually being turned on by it.  Yikes!  Well, I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but it scares me to think that there are so many \\"supposedly\\" intelligent, independent women out there that are liking this, and that this is \\"spicing up\\" some marriages.  I understand about \\"fantasies\\" but this is the pits.  Can't wait to hear from some of my own personal friends as to what they think of it.  If they love it, too, I will be even more confused.  Hope someone can make me understand.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I got this when it was the free app of the day.  What a deal!  you need to also get Quell Reflect.  $1, and you get $1 credit for Amazon MP3s, so it's also like free!
B006OCM0G0|1.0|I don't usually give a \\"ONE\\" star rating but I am really furious! I played this game for weeks and bought several \\"gems\\" to move it along a bit. I was on the 39th level and I had a problem with my Kindle. I wrote to the company,yesterday, explaining that my Kindle was not working and that I was getting another one from Amazon today. It is now almost midnight and i never heard a thing from the company. Opimistically I downloaded the game from my \\"cloud\\" thinking that just MAYBE, the game in my cloud was at the level I was at, but nooooooo. All I have is a brand new LEVEL ONE game and the \\"Storm\\" company has all my money!!! I could have bought a game on a disc five times over.<br /><br />Since I haven't seen it anywhere here are the cost of these \\"Gems!\\" Keep in mind that in order to make you restaurant larger to fit more than 10 customers, you must make it larger in increments every few levels. The first couple of feet cost 20 Gems EACH and then it goes up to 40 Gems for a couple of more \\"feet\\" additions<br /><br />24 Gems $4.99<br />50 Gems $9.99<br />105 Gems $19.99<br />275 Gems $49.99<br />580 Gems $99.99<br /><br />So you can see that this is NOT some Nickel and Dime Operation! After a couple of of 20 Gem increases which cost you almost $5.00 EACH time, you THEN have to pay just short of $10.00 EACH time. And each increase is not huge in terms of size. You do not even realize when it is $5.00 here and there BUT when you add it up it becomes quite costly for a game. I didn't realize how much until I added up my receipts.<br /><br />Those who have no problem with this are obviously not affected by a continuing recession, where prices of food in my area have tripled!<br /><br />Finally remember that if something happens with your computer, laptop, tablet or Fire you lose it ALL and the employees of this company \\"Storm\\" are so busy counting their money, they are too busy to answer their customers questions!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this. it keeps me occupied for ever. some of the games are difficult but overall its good
B002E01MB0|2.0|Ick.  Burned again by Janus and the lure of a $20 DVD from B&N.<br />Heads cut off, bad sound, bad picture... why didn't I hold out for Criterion?

B0061S0A64|1.0|This freaking painfully boring monotonous useless app is 25 megabytes after you install it!! And no matter what you do, all of it sounds the same! Picture like a music box going at triple speed playing a song backwards, thats what it sounds like. You just drag these circles to the screen and its supposed to add to this noise, just making the noise sound more worse with each circle. Like a 3 yr. old kid who had too much sugar and ran their hands back and forth over a harp. I dont know where this stuff is coming from about making creations and songs since its not like you can make anything resembling a song melody unless maybe if you are an audio engineer and can figure this crap out. This is no way for somebody like the average Joe with no electronic musical training. After my girlfriend played these annoying sounds for almost 20 mins straight with a look of pain, I couldnt take it anymore and wanted to scream and claw my face. Hope nobody actually paid anything for this app.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This is a really wonderful game. You search for the missing girl, discover secrets, and there are some hidden object puzzles too! BEST. GAME. EVER.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is goofy fun and can be sort of addictive, but it fun to play around with during times of boredom or inactivity.
B0061S0A64|5.0|love this app...easy to use, clear as a bell sound and fun to mess. no bugs from what I can tell....5 stars easy
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very good app. Have read 3 books so far and have not experienced any problems. Will continue to use for new ipad.
0316113506|5.0|This book should be required reading of all health care professionals, and especially psychologists and therapists.  Most people know exercise is good for your body, but few even think of the help it brings to the mind.  Most running books I've read have maybe a paragraph on benefits to the mind brought by exercise, with no scientific backing.  This book is a non-stop list of the reasons everyone who can should be working out, just for the good it does for our brains.  It is packed with scientific studies backing up the positive changes that exercise induces, from promoting new nerve cell growth to rewiring depressed or distracted brains.  While some of the chemistry is sort of hard to get through, it doesn't get too dense, and is actually a clearly written guide to the brain.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in exercise, mental health or just health in general.
B004FOA84A|1.0|The download took over 15 hours. It took about that much time to finish it. It was fun but definitely not worth the hassle.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love the quick paced games when I only have a few minutes! some are really fun!! some not so much. The touch screen doesn't always work well, however it is still worth playing
B006XIR9KM|1.0|This game has no point.. there is no bade of it.. u pretty much cant win because new tiles keep coming and they move around so you cant tolls. there r like only tout shapes so there is no point.<br /> I couldn't stand it... don't get this app...
1612130283|5.0|I started to laugh in the 1st chapter so I knew I would like it.  The book is intense.  E L James keeps me guessing and wondering after every turn of the page.  I could not put it down.  Took me 5 days to read and I'm a slow reader.  Every free moment I had my nose was stuck in it.  I have a 2 year old, a full time job, & a personal business.  Every day I was left wanting to read more.  I'm glad I bought the entire set.  I was very upset when I finished 50 Shades of Grey and was thankful that I had to just go to my kitchen to get 50 Shades Darker.  I love these books and have recomended them to every women I know at work and at home. I have co-workers reading them, friends, and my sisters. Now I'm just trying to get my husband to read them.

B001I511TU|4.0|Eye of the Needle was Ken Follett's breakout novel, and still a favorite among his readers who often criticize his later works as being formulaic, predictable, lacking character development, etc.  This is strange, as those books are generally far superior to this one in those very respects.<br /><br />Of all the Follett novels I've read so far, this had by far the flattest characters.  You basically learn everything you need to know about them in the first few pages, after which Follett develops them very little.  The only real development later in the book is the Needle character's falling in love with the heroine, which is actually out of character for him and not adequately explained.<br /><br />Eye of the Needle was also easily Follett's most formulaic novel of those I've read.  For instance, it follows the classic formula of WWII thrillers of inserting a scene with Churchill expressing how the entire balance of the war hangs on the situation in the story, or with Hitler saying much the same.  Follett does both...repeatedly.  After several scenes of Hitler informing his council that if the Needle fails they will lose the war, and Churchill informing British intelligence officials that if they fail to STOP the Needle THEY will lose, I was just thinking, \\"Okay, I GET it already.\\"  Presumably, this is done to raise the stakes---but let's face it, we all already know how the war turned out anyway, don't we?  So this rather backfired, and by the end I really couldn't have cared less about the supposed consequences for the war effort, and only wanted to know what the heroine's fate would be, despite Follett's apparent insecurities that that wouldn't be enough to carry the novel.<br /><br />All that said, the characters, though a bit thinly drawn, were fairly interesting, and the basic story, though somewhat overblown, was pretty good.  So on the whole, I'd say it might be worth reading, but I'd recommend giving some of his later stuff a chance over this.  Three and a half stars.half stars.

B005LAJ23A|3.0|After watching the last season which was obviuously suffering from a lack of funding, we now get to buy 13 episodes for an inflated price.  This is a simply ridiculus price for such a shortened season. A typical series has 20-25 episodes per season and even then this would be too much for a great T.V show, which Walking dead is struggling to be.<br /><br />Rumors abound that AMC fired Darabondt for arguing with producers about the lack of funding for the episodes. Then we get an entire season , stuck on a single set (the Farm) where anyone with half and eye could see the cheapness of the season as compared to the first. You could almost hear the AMC' Exec's saying to Greg Nicotero (the shows special effects wizard), now here is your zombie kill money this week, make it last.....<br /><br />How about a real season of 20 episodes, and some serious money being put into one of the most successful cable series ever?? I seriously believe they are killing off major characters from the graphic novel to save on saleries. The making the DVD set so expensive?<br /><br />This set shoud be priced much lower as the value of having this season on Blu-Ray is not worth the price of 13 episodes.
B006QVRVJK|4.0|Heads up: Be sure to watch closely the kids playing in the park in the opening scene.<br /><br />You will laugh throughout this movie as you watch the turmoil unbelievably escalate. Starts out as a civil discussion between parents that stems from a dispute between their sons. Darkly comical, absurd yet revealing as to how the simplest and most innocuous words are interpreted by others. Quality acting by everyone (well, the guys don't do much in life anyway so don't expect them to do much here) and especially by Foster - what range she has.<br /><br />Would be five stars had the writers scripted an ending where the parents throttled each other and in their last breathing moments they catch sight of the hamster walking through the doorway.
1401937268|5.0|I had been waiting forever for an Angel oracle deck that was made to mirror the traditional Tarot, but without all of the negativity and ego based properties that some tend to associate with the Tarot. This is one of the most alluring and poetic Tarot decks I've seen. From the moment I opened the package I felt a rush of incredible uplifting energy flow through me. Each card is very powerful and the artwork and illustrations are detailed and magical.  This is a stunning and impressive Tarot/Oracle deck.<br /><br />There are 78 cards just as you would find in the traditional Tarot, but this deck only uses gentle words and images. Some words have been changed for certain cards that would exist in a regular Tarot. You won't find the \\"Devil\\" card in this deck, but an alternative name, \\"Ego\\".  There is also no \\"Tower\\" card which is usually a frightening image in the traditional Tarot, but in this deck is more appropriately titled for me, \\"Life Experience\\".<br /><br />The Major Arcana exists in the deck, but each card corresponds to a specific Archangel.  For example:<br /><br />Justice - Archangel Raguel<br />The Sun - Archangel Uriel<br />The Hermit - Archangel Raziel<br />The Wheel - Archangel Michael<br />The Chariot - Archangel Metatron<br />Life Experience - Archangel Chamuel<br />Strength - Archangel Azrael<br />The Dreamer - Archangel Metatron<br />Unity - Archangel Sandalphon<br />Renewal - Archangel Jeremial<br />Awakening - Archangel Gabriel<br />The Lovers - Archangel Raphael<br />The World - Archangel Michael<br />The Star - Archangel Jophiel<br />Balance - Archangel Zadkiel<br />Ego - Archangel Jophiel<br />The High Priestess - Archangel Haniel<br />The Magician - Archangel Raziel<br />The Empress - Archangel Gabriel<br />The Emperor - Archangel Michael<br />Release - Archangel Azrael<br /><br />It was interesting to find that each of the Major Arcana cards correlated perfectly to a specific Archangel and that Archangels speciality. What I loved as well was that each of the Four Elements in the Minor Arcana also corresponded to something magical and angelic. There is nothing harsh about this deck.<br /><br />In a traditional Tarot deck you would have the Fire \\"Wand\\" set and in this deck the cards are labeled as \\"Six of Fire\\", \\"Seven of Fire\\" and so forth. The beautiful artwork for this element is of Dragons. Picture the \\"fire\\" breathing image of a Dragon as well as the Chinese Astrology depiction of the Dragon behavior. Fire is action oriented. (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius)<br /><br />As for the Sword set in a traditional Tarot which would be the element of 'air', this deck is made up of magical Unicorns. \\"Five of Air\\", \\"Six of Air\\" etc. Imagine a Unicorns horn as a symbol of the Sword. Unicorns are airy and whimsical just like the element of Air which also represents thought and mental processes. (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius)<br /><br />The Pentacles reside in the Earth element in a traditional Tarot, but in this deck the images are of Fairies in Garden like atmospheres, \\"Three of Earth\\", \\"Four of Earth\\". etc. In the Tarot deck the Pentacle cards are associated with the physical and tangible, so it's no surprise the image of the Elementals also known as Fairies are used. Fairies are outside in nature and assist us with concrete needs such as finances, home and sometimes obtaining love. (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn)<br /><br />Water is the most beautiful section of the deck using Mermaids as the star of this part within the set. In a traditional Tarot it would be known as \\"Cups\\", here its been changed to \\"Water\\": \\"Seven of Water\\", \\"Eight of Water\\" etc.  The visions of the Mermaids in blue sparkling water associate with emotions, feeling and needs. The Mermaids dive into the depths of water or in this case assists us with getting to the core of an issue internally in order to manifest our desires. (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)<br /><br />Each set (fire/water/earth/air) within this set of cards have different colors that correlate witheach element. You can easily pull them out within the deck. The Water set has a Blue border, Earth has Green, Air has Royal Blue, Fire has Burgundy and the Major Arcana is Royal Purple.<br /><br />If you're new to the Tarot, but have had difficulty in learning the way it works, this is a great deck to use. I've always found some of the Tarot decks to be difficult to gravitate towards and learn. I did not have that issue with this one and in fact it's made me branch out into visiting other Tarot decks out there.  It's laid out efficiently in the little guidebook that comes along with it. More importantly this deck is also an angel deck to assist you in becoming more familiar with the Angels and Elements that make up the other spiritual planes. This deck is also helpful in getting to know some of the Archangels functions on top of that.<br /><br />The cards in this deck are always accurate for me.  I manage to pull the exact cards that are mirroring the situation or feeling I'm having that given day.  Sometimes I'll keep pulling the same card repeatedly to get me to notice an issue or concern that I'm not addressing or a foretelling of what's to come.  I've given reads for other people and have found the same cards would keep falling out for them.  They've commented at how accurate a read I've done for them is.<br /><br />The cards have some key phrases and descriptive words on them as this is a deck that was made so that a beginner or someone new to Tarot could easily use.  The Tarot is not evil, but many who are unfamiliar with how to use it may shy away from it because some decks do have harsh images and complicated messages.  This deck is being marketed as gentle and safe for those that fall into the category of fearing the Traditional Tarot.  After becoming acquainted with this deck you'll find yourself getting excited to join the world of Tarot and find that it is what you make it.<br /><br />I've finally found a Tarot deck that I'm 100% happy and comfortable with using effortlessly and with complete accuracy.  Other decks I've used would fall to the wayside as I wasn't gravitating towards them or feeling any sense of excitement or truth.  I have not had that problem with this deck.  This is now my prized possession.  This is truly a gift from the heavens.each element. You can easily pull them out within the deck.

B007VGXS8M|1.0|I have played this game before and their is no way that this app is worth 0.99.  This app should be free because it sucks that much.
B005MVIF7M|5.0|This is a wonderful album even if you're not a huge Wilco fan.  This is a very listenable album, with a solid upgroove on half the tracks combined with moving slower tunes.  The album has a very tight sound.  As a child of the 80s and 90s, I feel like Wilco has solidly taken the place of R.E.M. in my musical world.  Alternative, not everyone's cup of tea, great alt rock.
B00634GHJA|1.0|Dropbox does this without user input... Plus it let's you transfer any type of file, without limits... Not worth the free download &amp; I sure wouldn't pay for it... Don't waste your time

B000FC1MM8|5.0|I first read Connelly's The Poet because it had so many stellar recommendations on the back cover and I was in an airport and wanted something engaging for a long flight. Plus the title, you know? \\"The Poet\\", a crime thriller. Anyway, the book was OK but with a lackluster fake cinematic ending and I didn't read Connelly for a few years after. When I did, I read Nine Dragons -- again, just OK, Black Ice, Trunk Music and The Narrows. All of them...just OK, with Trunk Music being the most engaging. Harry Bosch hadn't taken hold of me...yet.<br /><br />Then, passing through the wild wormhole of time as we call living life, I reengaged Connelly/Bosch in the early work, The Last Coyote and I was hooked. Following quickly with Echo Park, The Overlook, The Black Echo, The Concrete Blonde, Angels Flight, City of Bones, Lost Light and The Closers I realized that these books are the best work of the author and stand above a lot of popular fiction. Mr. Connelly makes all the right choices in event, dialogue, pacing, detail and subtext that it is kind of amazingly true. While being mostly police procedural it stays emotionally engaging as the reader sublimates the details into an adventure of discovery. Not really a whodunit, that is, it is less about the culprit than the the path to him/her and the consequences of calling them out.<br /><br />The Harry Bosch character is often referred to as \\"dark\\". This is incorrect. He isn't. He's normal in a nut-so world. His motives are logical and resolute. He embodies a selfless principle that always runs across the bow of the authority juggernaut.<br /><br />The Last Coyote is the book that got me reading all the early Harry Bosch novels. See for yourself.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|A fan of the books for many years, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the HBO adaptation. I don't imagine there are many fans of GRRM who have not yet seen these, but if you're one of them go ahead and take the plunge... it's worth it!<br /><br />The only negative side to this blu-ray product is that some of the commentaries are just silly, but I wouldn't judge a show like this on the odd choices for commentary.<br /><br />Overall a wonderful purchase!

B003EY7IUY|3.0|As usual, the Shopaholic books keep me laughing and quickly turning pages.  But also as usual, the Shopaholic books leave me extremely frustrated with Becky and how she never ever learns anything or has to take any responsiblity.  I had a few issues:<br /><br />***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br /><br />1) The book is titled after Becky's daughter Minnie, so you might think the book is about her.  But no, the only words Minnie seems to know are \\"mine\\" and \\"Starbucks.\\"  She has zero personality other than being a monster, and she's really just a minor sub-plot.<br /><br />2) Becky is trying to throw Luke a surprise birthday party on a very limited budget.  Of course she screws everything up and is about to have to face reality, when in swoops Luke's birth mother Elinor with her unlimited checkbook and contacts with every rich person on earth, and voila!  No more money worries for Becky!  Yay!<br /><br />3) Becky gets in trouble for devising a very dishonest \\"private\\" shopping scheme for her clients at The Look.  But then in swoop all her materialistic sneaky clients to defend her and of course she is offered her job back and doesn't learn a damn thing.<br /><br />4) Nanny Sue, a professional, shows up to offer Luke & Becky advise on Minnie's behavioral issues.  Minnie is clearly a spoiled brat, but does the professional nanny think so?  Of course not!  Becky is right all along!  Minnie is wonderful, \\"intelligent\\" even.  Intelligent?  When has she ever shown that?? It's so frustrating because here we go again, Minnie is turning into Becky with everybody already letting her get away with all the BS she pulls.  All the nanny does is diagnose Becky as a shopaholic and offer her therapy, which Becky conveniently gets out of by the end of the book.<br /><br />And on and on.  It's extremely frustrating that she never learns.  And even worse is all the lying. My God is she a pathological liar.  I understand that these are the things that make her a funny character, but there needs to be SOME character growth in a series!  I mean, the end to the series must be coming soon, so come on! Start wrapping her up a bit!<br /><br />Anyway, I still found the book pretty hilarious, particularly when Becky and her mum and Janice discover the dollar store (as you can imagine).  And it had a twist at the end that almost made me forgive Becky all her faults.  That's the thing with these books - she'll frustrate the hell out of you, but then when she finally pulls off whatever it is she's trying to pull off, you're actually kind of happy for her....and you know you'll read the next one.e SOME character growth in a series!

1932100660|5.0|The Introduction to this book alone is fascinating.  From life on a dairy farm to Agent Orange in Viet Nam and everything in between.  This is behind the scenes information on products and chemicals and ways of doing business that have affected most of our lives. It is confirmation of what many of us have so long suspected.  It is information about how health information is generated and communicated AND WHO CONTROLS SUCH ACTIVITIES. It is proof that we have been lied to and manipulated and paid for the priveledge, as taxpayers.  The most important part of this book for the masses is the information about the organizations whose business it is to make sure people consume their products.  Misrepresentation and exageration in advertising are hugely responsible for the current obesity in this country and it's subsequent diseases.<br /><br />People trust what they see and hear on TV.  Most people are exhausted and complacent (flouridated water?) and do not take the time to do the research on whether or not a claim made on TV or in a magazine is accurate.  It is easier to take it at face value.  This book should be a required read for all students in our school system to enlighten them to the fact that we are at the mercy of the huge conglomerates and what they choose to tell us or how they choose to interpret a study -in their own best interests - not for the public health.  And once again the effect of lobbyists on release of information or how information is presented is significant.  As a nation we are ignorant of where our information comes from and how much of it is filtered.  We are told what the \\"1%\\" want us to hear. The executives of the chemical companies and the drug companies and the food industry and the entertainment industry including the news agencies are in league with some in government to keep us buying and consuming certain products, including healthcare services and medicines that don't work,  at whatever cost. And that cost seems to be our health.If readers are enlightened by this one fact alone then the book is well worth the read and Campbell has done a huge service to his fellow man - something almost unheard of these days. These companies and some members of our government benefit from our ignorance and complacency. After four decades of research, education and policy making at the highest levels of our society, Campbell is certainly qualified to share this story.<br /><br />We are \\"fat sick and nearly dead\\" (another good work, a video by Joe Cross)as well as ignorant as to how we got here.  As an \\"insider\\" for the majority of his career Campbell was privy to the information many of us always have wondered about.  This book opens our eyes to how the system really operates. If people would just start to question what they are told and think for themselves instead of trusting that everything in print or on air is truth we could begin to reclaim our country from the crooks who have stolen it from us including some in government who have helped create and support this \\"system\\" for years and years and YEARS....
B000URWYTS|4.0|Excellent book about Frank Lloyd Wright  from architecture to the women in his life.  Well written, honest and revealing.  FLW was a snake.  He owed money all over the US and Europe.  He left his family on a whim, dragged his mistress (who I found to be a weak, sad woman with little character) across Europe and settled in Wisconsin.  The end will knock you sideways.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is excellent and serves as a positive influence in anyone's lives, especially fathers.  Highly recommend to anyone but most importantly the father who wants the best for his family.
B006J420UE|5.0|At 139.99 its a little expensive vs the competition. But the performance/watt ratio is significantly high to offset the higher price. Especially considering the fact that the graphics performance is equal (mostly) to the low end discrete cards like the GT 240, Radeon 6450, Radeon 6570 etc.<br /><br />One con is that this CPU (or rather APU) does not have a turboboost. Something that I wish it had.<br /><br />Secondly this is a 100W APU. But it runs pretty cool. No heating issues for me.<br /><br />My only gripe is about the fan. The stock fan is a little too loud for my taste. I have the APU inside a LianLi PC-Q11 case. My intent was to build a HTPC. So quietness is a big factor here. The fan quietened a bit after I enabled CPU temperature based fan speeds. This brought down the fan speed from 3200 RPM when it was going full ON to about 2200 RPM. Still the whine is noticeable in a quiet room, but if the TV is playing or there is some background noise then its drowned out!<br /><br />I have overclocked it to 3.7 GHz on air and still stable. But the power consumption goes up significantly and so does the fan noise. So I am back to stock speeds.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this APU. If you are looking for something that has good CPU performance plus good graphics performance then this is it. This does not give you the best CPU performance or the best graphics performance, but it gives you a good amount of both in one package.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I started reading the Hunger Games Trilogy to decide if it would be appropriate to take my nine year old daughter to see the movie ... more on this later.<br /><br />The plot of the story is good; but I wouldn't say it is excellent. Where all three books excel is in the characters. Collins creates extremely realistic and believable characters. In fact, I cannot remember the last book I've read (and I read a lot) with as well developed characters as in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Having read all three books I decided the themes covered were a bit too disturbing for a nine year old, either to read or see in the movie (although I am not totally sure about this, but decided to err on the side of caution). Having said that, I think the Hunger Games would make an excellent book for high school students (13+) to study.<br /><br />Overall the series is fantastic, and thoroughly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is a good game. Fun and lots of games. Easy to play,  but still challenging. This is a favorite.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy playing most of the games. I do however think that there could be more time on a couple of them. overall I like the challenge of the games.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Started reading and could not put it down. Great love story with steamy passionate encounters. A must read but not for the faint of heart.
B00634GHJA|1.0|I was about to get this app, and then I noticed the review mentioning Dropbox, which I use all the time on my laptop and work computer. So I installed it on my Android phone, and as soon as I opened it, it offered to sync photos *and* give me 500MB extra storage for doing so! Yay! I won't be bothering with this app after all.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Amazing puzzle game! If youve ever played the old classic chips challenge this very much similar style of puzzles =)
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I devoured this book. I was out for an afternoon with my family when I bought it for my kindle app on my phone which was a mistake because I kept wanting to hide away and keep reading! Especially the first half of this book I thought was just fantastic. Highly recommended.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love,  love,  LOVE this app! I especially love that it has the sound so I can hear it in my car or when I'm busy doing something else. Its so easy to use and there are lots of translations to choose from.

B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham will always be entertaining in my opinion. He brings us the most interesting and believable characters in real life scenarios....I enjoyed the characters and the twists and turns of this novel. The book really came to life for me.
B007Q476KU|5.0|a must see this movie is every thing you could expect worth buying rather than renting, was skeptical at first but hey the movie delivered
B006W0QOF2|5.0|First I can start by saying this movie is NOT for everyone. For people who are looking for a action packed \\"shoot em up\\" styled movie move along. This movie is filled with depth, depth, and plenty more of it. Refn (the director) filmed this movie with a script with not much dialogue, and if you have read the book this movie is based off of you will find not much dialogue in that either. Drive calls you to fill in the blanks and think like a human for once, scenes that yell emotion fill this movie, but with silence. Drive basically is movie that will have you trying to relate what you would do given the a situation in which you must choose to lower some of your moral standards to protect the ones you love and care about. Drive is in itself its own genre and if you choose to purchase or just watch it, try to just relate, think, and enjoy it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a cool game like the content my boys love it I cant get them away from it lil
0312576463|1.0|I just finished Freedom, and more than anything I am angry with myself for spending the to time read it. What a waste! The story reads like a soap opera--it's totally unrewarding. None of the characters are particularly likable and Franzen spends too much time ranting about his politics. If you like reading about whiny white rich liberals who try really hard to make problems for themselves you'll like this one.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Awesome game! I'm so glad they finally came up with somethin like Mario! I'm so aditcted! Love love love love this game
B006IDG2T6|3.0|Free Will provides an enticing introduction to the topic of free will.  Sam Harris briefly covers what neuroscience currently understands about how we make choices - an understanding which remains far from sufficiently comprehensive.  He then critiques how philosophers deal with this evidence in order to present Harris' own arguments for how we should handle our newfound, though still developing, understanding.  Harris also laudably introduces us to arguments contra his own, and as always those presentations are fair to their advocates along with also providing a great set of footnotes for further research.  Free Will makes for a fine extra-curricular first reading assignment for a college course on the topic.<br /><br />However Mr. Harris' argument on how we should define free will given competing definitions is not convincing.  Like Samuel Vicchrilli in his review of this same book, I found the compatibilist hypothesis more compelling, largely due to Harris' impressive footnoting and linking to competing source docs.  I'm unimpressed with Mr. Harris' argument partly due to the lack of content to help this reader get my arms around a topic beyond my own intuitions, in spite of:<br />1) my not having any problem abandoning long-held conclusions when superior explanatory models are presented, and<br />2) Harris perfectly describing why most people initially reject the idea we have no free will - where that hesitance includes myself.<br /><br />For neophytes like me on this topic, I'm glad I purchased this book.  In fact I plan to re-read it given its brevity and my increasing interest in the topic, which was enhanced by reading Free Will.  For those who criticize Mr. Harris lack of effort on this topic given the brevity of the book, I think they've got a point if they spent $10 on the paperback; however I'm happy with the value I received paying $3.99 for the Kindle for iPhone version.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This isn't the most shocking book on the subject I have ever read. With that said I have some complaints and praises.<br /><br />1. Anastasia is pretty boring, in my opinion. I'm sick of her whining and not accepting of gifts. I guess it would be weird if she were all \\"OMG YAAAAAY\\", but being a brat doesn't really make me like her that much.<br /><br />2. The story gives BDSM a bad name. The contract outline is fair and on par, but the constant drinking of wine while going through certain things makes it so much worse. People are going to think this is acceptable behavior for the lifestyle, and it is NOT acceptable. Since when do books have to play by the rules? When they decide to bring something very-underground to the mainstream surface.<br /><br />3. It is very slow moving. I hope the other books pick up some, otherwise this kind of makes me yawn at some parts.<br /><br />4. Some lines are extremely corny. When/if you read it, you will know what I mean. I snickered out loud.<br /><br />Positive Comments:<br /><br />1. I really like Christian as a character. I want to know more about him. I feel like the author gave more considering to his character development than she did Anastasia, even though Anastasia is the main.<br /><br />2. It's interesting enough to keep me engaged, and it's not as full-blown lame as other erotic novels.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Read it if you are curious. If you know nothing about BDSM, don't trust this book to be your guide.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Surprisingly fun game to play. Slightly difficult enough to work your brain a bit. Definitely worth the download to try.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun interesting game. Keeps me busy all day. Characters from ice age give it a kids feel. The only problem I have is to improve my friend rating, I have to sign into some sort of social activity. Otherwise, it is a very good game and I recommend this to anyone with the time and a SOCIAL NETWORK.
1582701709|3.0|I liked all the positive comments in the book but it is more of a narrative, testimonial kind of book.<br />In order to master what this book talks about you have to first master positive thinking, then master the art<br />of believing in events that you project, and finally master the ideas that will bring you wealth. It is a<br /> positive read and one of the best I've read, but not a \\"how to\\" type of read. I've seen books that are more<br /> \\"to the point\\" and easy to understand on this topic.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is a lot of fun for anyone. yes, your energy runs out fast but you get a refill with every new level. patience is a virtue.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it to kill time at work.. kids love. the game also... like that you don't have to use cash to buy new games
B007JRU2UK|2.0|When Matt King (George Clooney)'s wife goes into a coma, he realizes how distant he was from her and from his two daughters.  Then he learns his wife was cheating on him.<br /><br />George Clooney plays against type as a clueless father and husband with baggy eyes and a beaten-down face.  He slouches through the story and generally looks pretty ordinary. He's good in the role, but not good enough to save the movie.  My first problem with it is the constant profanity used by the two young daughters; it's off-putting, to say the least.  Second, the story is a real downer, dealing with death, infidelity, and family struggles.  Third, it's relentlessly tedious, so monotonously depressing that it gets old fast.  And lastly, I didn't like or care about any of the characters.<br /><br />The Hawaiian scenery is beautiful and it represents unvarnished reality, but it's just not my idea of entertainment.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|My son bought $90 worth of in app gold...it is way too easy to do I almost bought some myself trying to figure out how to put a password on it...does anyone know how to lock purchases for this game?
B004TPJMLA|5.0|Great music!  Born At The Right Time is timeless.  Paul Simon melds rock and world music better than anyone, save perhaps David Byrne.
B000Q66JXA|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Very few films achieve timelessness, let alone the timelessness of its subject, if indeed, it's subject is truly timeless. &#34;Excalibur&#34; is such a film, a film that is destined for immortality, just as its subject. Transcendence on film is a rare thing, & this is truly a rare film of transcendence.<br /><br />Not only is this movie the best King Arthur story ever committed to film, it is also one of my favorite films of all time! An epic story of Camelot. An epic story of King Arthur & his knights of the round table. An epic film of betrayal, quest, honor, magic, ambition, tragedy. Perfectly acted & executed, with flawless sets, costumes, & beautiful scenery. &#34;Excalibur&#34; is one of the most gorgeous looking films in cinematography history, a kaleidoscope of rich colors, with a dramatic sound track to match! &#34;Excalibur&#34; is nearly the perfect movie, & no doubt the most perfect film of its subject!<br /><br />For those who love a film with grace, pageantry, & undeniable class, this film stands alone as the pinnacle of it's genre.<br /><br />A true masterpiece!<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is good, but the film has a softness to it in spots, no doubt because of the way it was filmed to begin with. Still, this Blu-ray is the version to have for fans of this movie!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very addictive and fun one of my favorite apps, works very well on the kindle fire. would recommend to friends.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I don't usually read this genre(I'm a sci-fi and horror lover) but it was talked about so much, I just had to buy it.  And I'm glad I did. I couldn't put the book down.  It had a great mix of erotica, comedy and drama.  The characters were nicely developed and interacted wonderfully with one another.  There were a few terms that were repeated way to much (her inner goddess), but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  I'm going to buy the next one right now!
B0056C6XIA|4.0|Great little tool to have.  I like the way the multi-tool comes with a good little flashlight and a fire starter.
B000AP04NI|4.0|I have to admit that I haven't bought this particular DVD, but the movie itself is really a delight. I didn't like it when I was younger, but I'm in my 20's now and it grows on me a little more every time I see it. It was on TV yesterday (not in letterbox though, ugh), and you can't help smiling at the tunes, innocence, and sweet romance.<br />Shirley Jones is stunning to look at in her introduction to the big screen, and her voice packs an equally big punch. If I had a beau as good-looking and sweet with a voice like Gordon MacRae, well, I think I'd have to agree with Aunt Eller when she tells him, \\"why, I'd marry you and git you to set around at night and sing to me.\\"<br />In a way, I can't help drawing a comparison between Gordon MacRae and fellow show-stopping actor/singer Howard Keel. Big men with rustic good looks and crystal clear booming voices.<br />So as far as this DVD edition, I can't say, though I would love to have it if it wasn't so pricey, but the movie itself, well... for me it is in a class with the only four musicals I will watch, but happen to love: Singing in the Rain, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, The Sounds of Music, and Oklahoma!
B005HE5J7I|5.0|I am enjoying the book.  I think the author makes the most of such a difficult, extensive subject.  He cleverly keeps the reader in suspense and always interested.  I would have loved seeing maps of London at the various stages of its developement and growth, or is it only kindle that does not include these?<br />I would like to add that I found many mistakes such as missing words and sentenses in the printing.  I have read quite a few books with my trusty kindle and it is the first time I have come across such printing errors.<br /><br />I love historical novels and am looking forward to reading Rutherfurd's books on Ireland and Russia.

Fire (with Arthur Brown)<br /><br />Once again Alice has brought out a live album that fans yearn for more of, but as usual, are left a little disappointed. It seems Alice track record is he goes from one label to the other and owes the previous label one or two more album, but instead of releasing a live album, it's a recycled greatest hits album where the tracks are just a dreadful pick for a best of compilation. Now Alice releases his latest live CD, and as much as I loved the last one, \\"Live At Montreux (2005)\\" which is possibly the best live release Alice has unleashed, comes \\"No More Mr Nice Guy; Live\\".<br /><br />Seeing the show on this same tour, the show was awesome and the musicians where great, but being a long time Alice fan, I know Alice had had better musicians in the line up.. but this line up could really wale... but I don't think their best performances have been captured on this CD.<br /><br />Tracks like \\"I'm 18\\", \\"Under My Wheels\\", \\"Under My Wheels\\" & \\"No More Mr Nice Guy\\" are found on just about every live release, but I beleive the definitive live versions are those found on either \\"Alice Cooper Classics\\", \\"Trashes The World (DVD)\\" or recordings from the same show. That entire show needs to be released on CD to get the definitive Alice Cooper live sound and the best versions of those songs live. But here they are again, instantly skipable because, well, I've already heard them played much better and have no desire to listen to inferior quality.<br /><br />The tracks \\"Elected\\" and \\"Clones\\" sound so much better on \\"A fist full of Alice\\". How can a version featuring Slash and Rob Zombie be outdone by this lower quality and less energetic drive version? And \\"Clones\\" on this release is absolutely horrendous. I don't know if it's bad editing, but the solos sound about .5 of a second off of time, not to mention, what he is playing over the song sounds horrible enough as it is. It's way out of the league of how awesome it sounded on \\"A Fist Full Of Alice\\".<br /><br />Most of the other songs on here, and I know this is sounding tiresome now, sound much better on \\"Live At Montreux\\".<br /><br />Really the only tracks here to note are \\"The Black Widow\\" as Alice has mostly had it preformed by the band without his presence over the last few years, now Alice has returned to singing the whole song. \\"Brutal Planet\\" sounds decent and a little different to other live recordings. \\"Hey Stoopid\\" is always a great song to hear live. \\"I'll bite your face off\\" hasn't been released yet on a live album. \\"Feed My Frankenstein\\" is always interesting to see if the current band can create solos as great as the recorded version with Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. \\"Wicked Young Man\\" same opinion as \\"Brutal Planet\\", and it's nice to finally have a recorded version in decent quality of \\"Schools Out\\" with the \\"Brick In The Wall\\" mash in it.<br /><br />The final track is \\"Fire\\". I thought it was a live version of the Hendrix song that Alice has also covered before both in the studio and live, but this is not that song. I don't know who Arthur Brown is, but after hearing this god awful song and performance by him, I won't be seeking out any of his other material either. He sounded like a bad impersonation of Spinal Tap or something, and even Alice and his band couldn't improve this guys voice.<br /><br />Overall, it's an album all fans will want, but if you have never heard an Alice live album before, I can't recommend enough you start with \\"Trashes the World\\" and \\"Live At Montreux\\" first.... or, actually scratch that. Start with \\"Whiskey A Go Go\\" and you will hear one of the worst noises you have ever heard in your life, then hear \\"The Alice Cooper Show\\", followed by \\"A Fistful of Alice\\" then everything after that like Live At Montreux 2005, this album, and Trashes The World will blow your mind how much better then those other first live albums where and how those previous horrid performances where done by the same guy on the better ones years later!
B00729GQ0A|4.0|The novel is definitely interesting and I couldn't put it down. The paranormal world we are brought in is interesting and laid out in a way that isn't too confusing.<br /><br />Some Spoilers Ahead!<br /><br />I did have a couple problems with the story but I'm sure since this is the author's debut novel, we all do make some mistakes. The relationship between Charles and Sophia could've been built better, their more intimate moments i.e. conversations not just sexual tension. The council, isn't very convincing. Callista doesn't reign Queen as I imagined, she isn't convincing neither is Damascus, but I accepted it in hope that there will be more convincing tales in the sequels.<br /><br />My advice? Give it a read! Its definitely interesting, and far better than some things I have picked up at the bookstore for this genre.

1594744769|5.0|One of my favorite all-time books is \\"The Thief of Always\\" by Clive Barker. This book reminded me so much of that classic. Much like a great animated film that is pleasing to both children and adults, this book reaches the entire audience. Nearly the entire book is centered around the young Jacob and eventually the \\"children\\" he meets at Miss Peregrine's Home; however, it never once feels like you're reading a children's book.<br /><br />The characters are well designed, the writing is top notch and the entire thing is gripping from beginning to end. And perhaps making it the most brilliant piece of writing ever is the fact that Riggs first had to find the strange and mysterious photographs to inspire the story, rather than have them produced by a special effects team once the book was completed. This novel is incredibly imaginative and a real breath of fresh air.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book, you really ought to do so. It was a marvelous ride, and I am very interested to see what he has planned for the survivors in book two.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I found this app one of the best I've downloaded. Very easy to use.  Fast upload and good quality. Worth the price!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Those who have not yet seen seasons 1& 2 of \\"Downton Abbey\\" are missing out. This period drama grabs you from the get-go. I love the characters, story-line and settings. This is pure indulgence. I highly recommend it and bought a copy for a friend too. Season 3 can't come to our shores soon enough!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Sound quality has to be the most important factor.  The other reviewers address that better than I could - I'm new to headphone amps, the E17 is my first one.  So far, I've mainly used it as a straight headphone amp with my Sennheiser HD 650s and a short direct line out from my iPhone's 30-pin connector playing lossless or 320 bit rate MP3s.  This configuration sounds really great.  But I've also tried the DAC functionality a few times, running a USB cable from my Macbook Air to the E17's USB input and sending the E!7's audio output either to my headphones or my Audio Engine A2s.  I can hear a difference when driving the 650s, not so much when driving the A2s (which are lower fidelity than the Sennheisers and have their own powerful amp).  I have not tried the E17's s/pdif input.<br /><br />The E17 has a lot of thoughtful design touches and some very thoughtful extras in the package.<br /><br />It's encased in finely brushed metal with a handsome display.  It looks and feels very high quality.  It's also small (smaller than an iPhone), so it's very portable.  It is easy to operate and includes adjustable gain, stereo balance, bass and treble (though I leave the EQ flat).  Being a newbie, I'm guessing it's useful to boost the gain when driving larger cans from devices that don't put out a strong signal.<br /><br />The E17's display does not seem particularly fragile, but Fiio thoughtfully includes a screen protector film to protect it from scratches.  The screen protector is custom fitted with two cutouts in the right places for the buttons.<br /><br />Fiio includes a short cable with minijacks on both ends, so you can start using the E17 immediately.  Although, if you're using it with an iPhone or iPod, I recommend getting something like this:  [[ASIN:B003UCESP8 FiiO L3 Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod and iPhone]], since the sound quality from the 30-pin dock connector is better than from the iPhone's earphone jack.  Fiio also includes a short USB cable (though you probably have a few laying around, it's just a standard cable with full size USB on one end and USB minijack on the other).<br /><br />Fiio includes two bands (made from silicone, I think?) which allow you to secure the E17 to the back of a smart phone or ipod touch. Fiio also includes a soft carrying pouch.<br /><br />Fiio claims the battery runs for 15 hours between charges.  I haven't timed it, but this seems about right in my experience.  When you need to charge the E17, you can plug it into the USB jack of any computer, or a USB wall charger, such as what comes with an iPhone, Kindle, or most smart phones.

In January, I researched both units pretty thoroughly (for a headphone amp newbie).  The consensus of the reviews seemed to be that the bithead sounds good but the E17 sounds better; that was enough for me to decide on the E17.  But at that time, the initial production run of the E17 had completely sold out.  I waited nearly 2 months, and finally got one in early April (3 weeks ago).

Fiio also includes a soft carrying pouch.<br /><br />Fiio claims the battery runs for 15 hours between charges.  I haven't timed it, but this seems about right in my experience.

B007PTJOV0|4.0|its a lot like mario. but its still pretty fun and its an awesome time killer. i would recommend this to others.
0545259088|3.0|So this is the finale book of a 3 book series. I thought the series was just ok. I happen to LOVE the Twilight series and I don't think this series holds a candle to the depth and excitement that Twilight had. I just muddled through the books because they were there, not because I had any strong desire to find out where the story was going to go or what was going to happen to the characters. Was it terrible, no. Will it appeal to it's intended demographic of preteen/teen readers-probably. I just didn't think it was robust, clever, interesting, or intriging.
B00634GHJA|4.0|Yes it works great, but WiFi Explorer Pro is way better because it lets you choose the directory that you want,This app drops everything into the same directory.<br />And with WiFi Explorer pro you can even make new folders as well.<br /><br />WiFi Explorer Pro<br />[...]

B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a nice puzzle type game that makes you use your brain to think how to solve it in the least amount of moves. The music is beautiful and very soothing. Some of the levels were challenging but some a little to easy. Still very enjoyable.

0316098329|2.0|The premise of the book sounded interesting - what would the effects of being raised in an isolated prison be on the development of a child?  But what the author gave us was so unrealistic and affected as to be nauseating instead of creating sympathy.  The decision to anthropomorphise all the objects in the environment was odd, and frankly, annoying.  Worse than that was the child's seamless ability to add definitive pronouns to similar objects later.  The child's areas of knowledge and ignorance were inconsistent.  The child also was not allowed to be an ordinary child in an extraordinary circumstance; the author also forced that the child had peculiarly unique abilities to recover emotionally, or more accurately, to fail to be affected emotionally by the experience.<br />Overall, I simply was unable to suspend my disbelief and relate to or even sympathise with the characters.  It all felt emotionally forced, and written specifically to evoke feelings in the reader rather than allowing a story to be told.
B007UXTQAU|5.0|&#34;No moral, no message, no prophetic tract, just a simple statement of fact: for civilization to survive, the human race has to remain civilized. Tonight's very small exercise in logic from the Twilight Zone.&#34;<br /><br />Whenever I see a bomb shelter movie, I always think about this &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; episode. It is the one where there is limited room in a bomb shelter as a Civil Defense announcement is made. The neighbors turn violent. Likewise in this film, it is the examination of people's character. Plot continuity is unimportant to the film. As a side note, notice the importance of plastic sheeting and duct tape during a terrorist attack.<br /><br />The action starts from the opening clip. No time for character build-up. The reason why there is no character build-up is that the people represent different aspects of society/human psyche. Mickey, (Michael Biehn) the super of a NYC apartment building has made a shelter in the basement...for himself. He ends up with a group of tenets which he resents and they likewise despise his cigar smoking rough ways. While he is hard-nosed, he looks out for everyone's safety. He won't win any congeniality contests.<br /><br />The tenets get on each others nerves. Some question Mickey's sanity. Things turn weird as there are outsiders of unknown origin. The film contains some realistic and horrific scenes of killing, torture, dismemberment, menstruation blood, and rape. It examines our core psyche and how it relates to our society: The desire for power and control among men, the competition of age and youth in women for suitors, and the many uses of duct tape. The bunker is a microcosm of society that starts out on equal footing and evolves into a &#34;haves&#34; vs. &#34;have nots&#34;. There is a struggle for their world's finite resources...which on a larger scale has happened outside the basement.<br /><br />F-bomb, sex, explicit sex talk, no nudity. As a metaphor 5 stars. As a sci-fi snuff film 2 stars.
B003BWERF8|1.0|I have noticed that dongles on the iPod when paired with a bluetooth headset produces maximum volume levels at around 60% of a corded headset.  I have been searching for a fix, but this seems to be a wide spread problem.  The bluetooth setup was very easy and within a few seconds was connected to various bluetooth headsets.  THe issue is the volume levels are very low and hard to hear when running outdoors or a noisy gym.  If  the surroundings are relatively quiet then all works fine.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|I've had this watch for nearly two years. It dies all the time and freezes and to wear I can't use it. Ended up getting another watch because this one is so unreliable. I don't like the bezel thing either. I thought it had completely croacked at one point and then it suddenly worked a few months later. I don't like this watch. I wouldn't recommend.
B007NYODBS|4.0|Tis true, this movie is neither for those in search of a light diversion, nor is it inspiring, nor intriguing to those who do not find human nature so.  Nor is it exciting in other than a mesmerizing, ironically comical manner.  If you seek in a movie any of those qualities, this will not be your cup of tea.  Don't beat yourself up.  Social satire, like revenge, is a dish best served cold.  In other words, should you desire to sample this fare, go into it with a clear head and your eyes open.<br /><br />On the other hand, there may be those among us who might find it fascinating to watch, undetected, as four people with the best of intentions behave outrageously.  If so, this is your wicked, dark cup of espresso.  How can four parents, so determined to arrive at a consensual conclusion to a touchy matter of offspring misbehavior, leap so badly off track in a matter of minutes?  Simply confine them in a room, and allow them to be their most earnest, self absorbed, selves.  They are as above-average in their own estimation as any human being.  They (parents of \\"perpetrator\\") are \\"...very touched by how generous you're being.  We realize how you're trying to smooth things over.\\"  (Parents of \\"victim\\":) \\"Please...it's the least we can do....(a few seconds later)...But he realizes he disfigured his schoolmate?\\"  With regards to the boy's tooth, \\"...apparently the nerve is not completely exposed...part of it is exposed...\\"  Ah.  Yes, that seems to be the problem.<br /><br />\\"We're born alone, and we die alone, that's it.\\"  Still, it can't hurt to sample a bit of top drawer single malt, can it?<br /><br />And there you have it.  Escalation ensues.  Nerves pertaining to parenting styles, culture, global values, marriage, child rearing, the treatment of a hamster, etc, etc, become completely exposed.  Scream, sob, rant, pummel, throw things, toss your cobbler if you must, but do not--I repeat, DO NOT--leave!<br /><br />Perhaps because it lacked the lightheartedness of many afarce,  the plot felt a bit contrived due to chronic incorrigibility and the \\"not leaving\\".  (It was a completely dysfunctional \\"Minnesota Goodbye\\".  Google it if you must.) Despite that, one of the more enjoyable aspects was the fun the actors seemed to be having underneath it all.  This was the most evident in Reilley and Waltz.  Winslet was very subtle with it, but Foster was a bit strained and intense for it to be quite as deliciously evil.  Maybe a bit more ebb and flow would have evened it out a bit in her case.  That said, all the portrayals were quite excellent in rising to the task of carrying the play to film.  It is simply well acted and directed.<br /><br />\\"Look, we're all decent people, all four of us.  I don't know how we got so carried away losing our tempers.  It's totally unnecessary!\\"<br /><br />\\"Stop it, Michael!  Stop...mediating!\\"<br /><br />We may find ourselves guffawing, horrified, wanting to slap the participants, unconsciously egging them on, or all the above.  It was a squirm worthy ride, at once uncomfortable and frustratingly familiar.  Just who is it we recognize?  Possibly others, but certainly not ourselves, is it?

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I saw this in theater tv and plan to order the video. I already have the CD. For sheer melodic invention, this show even surpasses \\"Phantom of the Opera.\\" Like its predecessor, this is worthy of being staged by the world's great opera houses. The only difference between these shows and legitimate opera is the use of microphones. I don't want to give away too much plot, but if you've seen the film version of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" this show contradicts the ending of the film--though not of the original stage version.
030796695X|4.0|Moneyball by Micheal Lewis is a very good listen about a subject the average guy knows zilch about.  The subject is management.  Management is where you find it or choose to find it.  The difference between an amature and the pro is the willingnees to apply mordern management tools.

1400164354|5.0|FitzChivalry Farseer, who barely survived an assassination attempt by his uncle, Prince Regal, has returned to Buckkeep where the King, his grandfather, lies dying. His other uncle, Prince Verity, is exhausting himself by trying to keep the kingdom together in the face of increasing attacks by the Red Ship Raiders. The Raiders continue to capture and, through some unknown process, \\"Forge\\" citizens of the Six Duchies. When these Forged citizens, who are now more like animals than people, are released, they start moving toward Buck Keep. What are they doing? Do they have some sort of programmed mission? What is the goal?<br /><br />When Prince Verity leaves the castle to look for the ancient (perhaps mythical) Elderlings, life becomes even more difficult for Fitz. He has the horrible job of tracking and killing the Forged Ones; he must avoid Prince Regal's attempts to kill him; he suspects that King Shrewd is being poisoned; he has to keep secret his ability with the Wit; he has to make sure Kettricken, Verity's Queen-in-Waiting, is happy and safe in her new home; he must stay away from Molly, the girl he's in love with while keeping Celerity, the girl that King Shrewd wants him to marry, at arm's-length.<br /><br />It's all rather grueling and the story becomes more and more intense as time goes on. Fitz has the choice to sit and sulk, or to suck it up and act like a man. Fortunately, Fitz has some allies who he knows he can trust: Burrich, the stable master who raised him; Chade, the assassin who trained him; Patience, his dead father's seemingly scatter-brained wife; and the Fool, an enigmatic little fellow who sometimes shows up with a mysterious riddle that turns out to be exactly what Fitz needed to hear.<br /><br />Royal Assassin is an excellent second book in Robin Hobb's FARSEER SAGA. It's full of action, great characters, intense emotion, political intrigue, and ugly treachery. It's a little hard to believe that a teenager could be wise enough to be counseling royalty on statecraft and affairs of the heart, but it's hard to resist FitzChivalry Farseer's appeal as the inconvenient bastard of a much-loved dead prince. In the first book, Assassin's Apprentice, Fitz was protected from his ambitious uncle Regal by King Shrewd and Prince Verity, but Shrewd is dying and Verity is gone, leaving Fitz to fend for himself. Hobb hasn't treated Fitz well up to this point so, even though these events are related in the first person by a future Fitz, the reader feels no assurance that Fitz is going to be okay. And, indeed, he isn't -- the ending is surprising and devastating.<br /><br />I've read these books before, but I can't wait to torture myself again with the third volume of the FARSEER SAGA: Assassin's Quest. This time I've been reading Tantor Audio's versions which are narrated by Paul Boehmer who does a great job portraying some of my favorite characters in all of fantasy literature.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|A nice, lightweight & non-bulky protector. Like that it doubles as a stand, but only for horizontal (video) viewing, not upright for reading.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Brief recap of overused phrases/sentences:<br /><br />Holy Cow!<br /><br />My inner goddess<br /><br />You're mine!<br /><br />I love you!<br /><br />Don't leave me!<br /><br />Cr@p!<br /><br />After the big blow-up and walk out that ended book one, Miss Steele and Mr. Grey are at it again, exchanging repetitive phrases ad nauseum and trading jealousy and insecurity between hot steamy sessions and endless ripping open of condom wrappers.  I'm glad they're being safe, but really didn't need to know about that particular detail, each. and. every. time.  (yeah, little words with full stops for emphasis are also unnecessary)<br /><br />That said, this second installment is much better than the first, and not just because she doesn't say \\"Oh My!\\" as much, but there's actually a story with some background and even a few twists.  Other characters get some page space, the BDSM becomes something akin to love instead of lust, and we begin to understand Mr. Grey's strange behavior. (Her thinking processes remain a puzzlement)<br /><br />The writing is still YA with an R rating, but at least a lot happens in this book outside of the bedroom (or wherever) and the ending makes one hopeful for book three.  Having purchased all three at the same time because of the extremely compelling cover art, I'll get back to you on book three, but if it's better than book two to the same degree that book two is better than book one, it should be entertaining.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, April 21, 2012
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I'd heard this movie was good, but I had no idea it would be this good.  Genuinely funny and heart-warming, great cast, great inter-generational plot lines.  Truly one of my favorite movies in years even though it is, in many ways, a small and quiet comedy.  Highly, highly recommend.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|Uggh. No budget! Throw in t and a and cheap fight scenes.  little choreography.  he nails the girl after knowing her, uhh, 3 days?
0670023329|5.0|This is a fantastic narrative of a young man, cursed by the tainted blood of his parents sins, to become a slave for life in Kim Jong Il Dictatorship. An astonishing insight into the worlds's most corrupt political regime and dynastic family of (Kim). This young man is, quite possibly, the world's luckiest person. Surviving the brutality of political prison #14 and somehow, through pure luck of circumstance, made it out of North Korea alive is too fantastic to imagine. This is a book you will devour in one sitting. I highly recommend this book but brace yourself for the shocking details and truth that such a place does actually exist.
145210655X|4.0|The concept is the best thing about this book. Picture Darth Vader as a doting father to the young Luke Skywalker. If that makes you grin, you'll like the book. About a third of the cartoons have no joke, per se, beyond the absurdity of the premise. \\"Luke do you need to go potty?\\" Some of the cartoons quote the original Star Wars trilogy (\\"But Daa-ad, you said we could go to Tosche Station after nap . . .\\", but most don't bother. It's just funny to see Darth Vader in typical paternal settings.<br /><br />The book doesn't provide much pleasure in repeat reading, and I believe it is most naturally a gift for a Star Wars fan with a young child, and in that context it might be worth even five stars.
B005CKPQNE|1.0|Very disappointed this excellent TV show did not include subtitles. I will rent the DVD from Netflix in the future to insure I get this critical feature

B004EPZ0BG|3.0|That's what I said after seeing this movie.  I love a good chick flick, but this isn't one.  It's just take it or leave it.  I didn't find it particularly funny or romantic.  I've liked both these actors in other movies, so I don't think it was their fault.  Hmm, see what you think, I thought is was corny.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|Really liked this book as I am a big Jane Austen fan, and love the book, Pride and Prejudice. She carried the characters through splendidly and it was a good read. Would definitely recommend this book if you like the characters from Pride and Prejudice and if you like mysteries.

The CD was as described~~great condition. Also received in just a few days. Thank you for this music!! It will definitely be enjoyed. I already played the CD several times, and it is just like new. Amazon is great~~if you can't find it on Amazon, you probably won't find it because Amazon has everything!!! I have been using Amazon for years and have rarely had a problem with any of my purchases. If you are a fan of the Godfather, as I have always been, you can't go wrong with this CD.

Very simplistic gameplay with enough variety to keep the User coming back for more.  The only downside, and why this wasn't rated 5 stars, is the frequency of ads that get annoying while playing.  Overall, a very fun app with lots of variety that I would recommend, especially since it is a free download.

1573228737|4.0|[...]    I like nothing better than an atmospheric, Victorian novel. Man, I got that and more with the Sarah Waters` novel Affinity. What a spectacular book that had this smug reader thinking I had the ending figured out, only to be totally humbled when I read the last few pages.    Margaret Prior, an upper-class spinster, is advised by her physician to become a \\"lady visitor\\" to help with her delicate constitution. As a visitor, Margaret enters the women's ward at Millbank prison and is like a fish out of water, having never encountered this class of women, both prisoners and prison matrons alike. As she increases her visits she becomes more comfortable and takes a particular interest in one special prisoner. Selina is a young spiritualist who is accused of murder and assault. Margaret befriends Selina and is captivated by the young woman and her abilities to talk to the spirits.  Margaret is convinced Selina has been wrongly accused and ultimately plots the escape of the fragile prisoner.    A gloomy prison setting, the appearance of ghosties and spirits and a psychological, gothic thriller to boot,  you can't go wrong picking up this great Victorian novel!

B000W7JWUA|4.0|My family and I like to play this game about once a month, sometimes less. It is our favorite game that we own. If you get this game though I recommend the other games of Catan. Overall it is a fun, complicated game.<br />It comes with a deck of cards( the resources)that you will need to establish settlements, roads and cities.<br />On each of your turns you can offer trades if you need something ex. one more ore to make a city you would trade it for lumber etc.<br />I recommend this game for ages 10+<br />Thanks for reading.
B007UXSPK2|2.0|This MI film is slightly more credible that the ones before it, but it's still far from believable. The plot, characters, gadgets, and general tone of the film are strictly comic book stuff. Nothing is believable. Still, it's entertaining, if you enjoy comic books. If you're looking for a realistic action film, OTOT, pass this and the rest of the MI series by.

First I was on my couch, so I got on a stool, still wouldn't work, so I got a ladder and went on my roof, still wouldn't work.

B00526ZKYS|4.0|Unless you want to come down with brain damage, partial paralysis, blindness, or worse, you must carefully await your eighteenth birthday and then immediately let the scientists cure you; you must in the world of Delirium by Lauren Oliver. And yea, they'll cure you, they'll cure you of L-O-V-E, the amor deliria nervosa and its symptoms of stress, heart disease, anxiety, depression, hypertension, insomnia, bipolar disorder. After a person is cured in Delirium and after they have been evaluated in multiple areas of knowledge, that person is matched to four other individuals. Even though the choice is limited, the choice is still available for those matched to rank their four options in order of most desired to least desired. Then, hopefully in a fairly satisfactory fashion, the match is finalized and marriage occurs. Only, for Lena, things don't go according to this already established plan for each citizen. With ninety-five days left before her cure, she falls in love.... and a much bigger shock, with a supposedly cured boy (but not really, he's escaped the procedure altogether and has been able to fool everyone into thinking he has had the procedure.) What transpires as a result is the highlight of this book.<br /><br />For a young adult novel, it is a fascinating one. The idea that Love can ruin us in both states, in being in love and being without love, is one that makes your heart, in fact, skip a beat and maybe, ironically enough, maybe even make you love this book. The ease with which the words can be read really is a result of the natural and organic feel of the writing by which Lauren Oliver executed this story. It has the feel of stream of thought that sort of makes you feel you're in a canoe and you're effortlessly flowing down the river. A very sensible approach to such a concept like love... natural, organic, and effortless. You are not reading words but conceptual imagery. It's easy to picture Lauren Oliver just sitting down and telling us this story asit is in her heart, and in her mind.<br /><br />Delirium describes a world in which the amor deliria nervosa corrups the well-being of the individual. Unable to think clearly, or make rational decisions. Being anxious, and feeling as though a knife shreds through your being trying to kill you. Your perception of life and the world becomes altered. Disables your ability to reason clearly and formulate sound judgments. Time jumps and lapses. Desire becomes one of the strongest emotions. Fear controls the spirit. The procedure cures it all, and it also cures Unnaturalism, the imbalance of chemicals and hormones that make boys prone to liking boys and girls liking girls (talk about a controversial topic). The cureds are safe from it all.<br /><br />This book has a heartbeat, it is alive. It resonates through you from the beginning to the end. It evokes something really powerful, the idea that love can both strength us and destroy us. How does it work? Do we get to choose whether it will let it strengthen us, or destroy it? Is it already decided on whether it will be better or worse if we fall in love depending on how it takes a hold of us? When Lena falls in love with Alex she experiences a sense of freedom, but with it a sense of fear as well. She finds herself noticing the negative symptoms everyone warns against, while at the same time feels the sense of courage that comes through the power of love.<br /><br />The book had the perfect ending. With this ending, the book stands on its own. It's one chapter of Lena's life, so to speak

B0072GPQNG|4.0|There are scenes in Steven Spielberg's 2011 film \\"War Horse\\" so extraordinary you will have difficulty catching your breath. Filmed with such artistic imagination, one could argue they are some of the most unforgettable celluloid moments ever realized. A cavalry charge through a field of wheat, an execution framed by a windmill and a horse fighting through a battlefield's barbed wire are just a few incredible images Spielberg has forged from his naturally creative genius. At times I was awestruck by this family film, and disagree with many critics who argue it's too violent for children (maybe in the decades before 24-hour cable violence). But don't get me wrong, this is not a great Spielberg film as it suffers serious miscalculations.<br /><br />Foremost, I found the performance of Jeremy Irvine in the teenage lead of Albert Narracott to be distractingly overwrought. I've read this was his debut, so it's puzzling filmmakers would cast someone so inexperienced for such a crucial role. He's practically on the verge of tears in every scene and never for a moment do I believe his angst. And did he have to look like a GQ model? As has been Spielberg's trademark, he enjoys casting unknown but usually talented actors for his films. The habit has succeeded more often than not (\\"Jaws,\\" [[ASIN:B000A2IPP0 E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Widescreen Edition)]], [[ASIN:B001N3P6SY Empire of the Sun]]). It's clear Steven was attempting to recreate the glorious eras of old-fashioned Hollywood, with strokes reminiscent of [[ASIN:B00006JMRD The Quiet Man (Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B002W7IH0Y Gone with the Wind]], [[ASIN:B000056BP4 Ben-Hur]] and, what the heck, let's throw in [[ASIN:B004H5X3XA The Yearling]] for good measure. But those sweeping technicolor epics had larger-than-life actors John Wayne, Clark Gable and Charlton Heston, and \\"War Horse\\" is in desperate need of such on-screen presence.<br /><br />On the eve of World War I, a rural English farming family is struggling tosurvive in a green valley. Father Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), suffering from alcoholism in jovial Darby O'Gill tradition, gets into a bidding war over a horse with his well-scrubbed landlord. Rather than a plow horse, he brings a beautiful chestnut thoroughbred to his doorstep, and Mother Narracott (Emily Watson) is incensed at such costly folly. They're now in danger of losing the farm, but misty-eyed Albert loves the magical animal and teaches it to plow a rocky field. The turnip crops abruptly fail, war breaks out and Father Ted must sell the horse to the British Army to survive.<br /><br />Thus begins an aggressively episodic series of chapters focusing exclusively on the regal horse as it attempts to survive the rigors of cavalry charges, machine guns and trench warfare. Albert enlists in the army and dreams of finding his equine pet. Yes, this is a fairy tale in the Walt Disney vein, and it is indeed [[ASIN:B003XQNZP0 The Incredible Journey]]. The film is based on a British children's novel by Michael Morpurgo ([[ASIN:B0071CNGI8 War Horse]]), which was adapted into a popular play, but the stark chapters erode emotional momentum and I had difficulty in relating to the horse's plight.<br /><br />I appreciated the abrupt chapters, as we are introduced to a noble British captain (Tom Hiddleston), youthful German brothers (Leonard Carow, David Kross), and a French man and his granddaughter (Niels Arestrup, Celine Bukens) who make jam while cannons thunder on the horizon. Any one of these chapters would have made a fine film, but are shoehorned into a frantic two-plus hour running time and disappear far too quickly. The runaway story would have been better served as a television miniseries akin to Spielberg's executive produced [[ASIN:B00006CXSS Band of Brothers]].<br /><br />Spielberg has made so many varied films over the decades, one can create multiple categories of classic, underrated and surprisingly bad. \\"War Horse\\" falls somewhere in the muddled middle, alongside [[ASIN:B005DN5BE4 Amistad]] and \\"Catch Me If You Can.\\" In such an unimaginative and crude age, I wanted this earnest film to be better than it was. While future retrospectives of the man's career will include scenes from this gloriously flawed work, the chaotic story did not evolve into the classic he was charging for.

It is very easy to read and follow like all her patterns that I have ordered from her.  She is one of my favorite designers and I can't wait to see what see comes up with next. I really enjoyed her chapter on design.  It was interesting to me that she never has a plan in mind when she designs.  It just evolves as she goes. Sabine tries to teach you this in the chapter.  The illustrations on all the projects are extremely well drawn out just like her patterns. Sabine Lippert to me is definitely one of the Great Masters of beadweaving.

Just like there's no one recipe for jambalaya, there's nothing bland or common about these songs - afrobeat, blues, jazzy flute & keyboard duets, heavy guitar, swamp funk, gospel... they're all tasty, and when mixed by a master, it's a feast for the ears and the soul!

0345803485|5.0|So the author isn't Hemmingway, or Rowling, for that matter.  It's still a great book.  Shocking? Yes! Provocative ?  Yes! I can forgive the simplistic  writing. Honestly, this first book is a little too hard core for me, but if the reader will  persevere and continue reading the trilogy, she/he will be rewarded with a wonderful love story.  So what if it mirrors Edward and Bella? Twi-haters get over it! The trilogy allowed me to \\"escape\\" for a few hours, which is a welcome break from my frantic work days.
B001E45XT4|3.0|I bought this headset as a replacement to my very, very nice FX Pro 7.1 headset.  As I am a graduate student I do not have a lot of \\"green\\" in the bank so I decided to give these a try based on the reviews I had read (on Amazon and also Newegg).  I hope my review will give some insight into how the title of this review is appropriate.<br /><br />Firstly, let me say that for 22 bucks, these are a decent deal.  I'll break it down into 2 sections: Build quality and sound quality.<br /><br />Build Quality:<br />These things seem to be pretty damn solid.  The plastic doesn't feel like it is likely to break in my opinion.  The set is rather large, mostly due to its earcups however I didn't really see this as a \\"con\\".  The headset is actually very light and doesn't weigh on your ears/head which is really nice; increases wearability over a long period of time.  It's a decently attractive headset too but this is really not much of a concern.  The cord is nice; long enough and the covering is durable.<br /><br />Sound Quality:<br />I think it's necessary to start this with a caveat.  If you are using your onboard audio there is a possibility that you will not be happy at all with the sound these things produce.  This was my case with the onboard audio with my Asus matx board.  The mids and highs were very clear, but the lows were almost nonexistent.  This left me wanting so much more.  However, I had an old Xfi xtreme music lying around and I installed it to see if it made any difference.  This made a world of difference.  The bass is still not at the level of my previous headset, but I can at least feel the lows now.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This headset with a proper dedicated sound card, or very good onboard audio actually produces nice clear mids and highs with fairly rich lows.  The virtual surround that my XFi produces is very nice and the direction the headset produces is pretty damned good for a stereo headset.<br /><br />Is it worth the buy?<br />if(you don't havea sound card && price == 20 bucks) yes;<br />if(you do have a sound card) definitely yes;
B0058EBNAO|3.0|I use this to check weather conditions for several US locations for friends and family every day.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|Not a bad app. Levels are quick enough that you can play one or two without killing too much time or but fun enough to keep your attention if you play several.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|solid app for your note taking needs. good design and seamless flow with other instances of application. really like the ability to search todo items within my notes.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|These headphones are the industry standard for headphone monitors in recording studios because they sound like the average person's home stereo.  That being said, they have virtually no bass response.  I suspect because the average person's home stereo doesn't have much bass response.  I would not recommend these headphones for casual listening.  If you're looking for headphones for casual in the $100 price range I would recommend the Sennheiser HD280's.  They have less fidelity in the higher frequency range than the K240's,  but have much better bass response. Also, the HD280's earpads press close to your ears and have excellent noise cancelation.  The k240's rest sloppily on your ears and do very little to cancel out outside noise.  Some audio professionals use the k240's in mixdown to get an idea of what their mix will sound like on the average person's home stereo, but I say look some where else than the k240s to find out what your mix will sound like.

0439023513|2.0|I think I now know why I cannot get into this trilogy all that much.  At first, I thought I got turned off by the hype and that fact that it is a young adult novel.  I just wasn't buying it.  But it wasn't any of that.  I read the first book and it was okay at best.  I watched the movie and liked it a lot.  And you know in my Catching Fire review, I loved it.  Yet one thing bothered me about that book... the writing.<br /><br />I had the same problem with this.  I had such high hopes after the very well-crafted second book.  I could not wait to read about what happens to Katniss and Peta, and even to Gale!  (I am Team Peeta all the way but I like Gale too.)  In the first two books, Collins introduced these characters and gave them storylines that made me care so much for them.  I felt sorry for Peeta, sympathized with Gale, wanted Katniss to succeed.  But by the end of this book?  I don't know what happened.<br /><br />The story picks up where the second one left off, at District 13.  There, Katniss and the other rescued victors are recovering and adjusting to their new home.  Not all of them were saved.  Peeta, together with Johanna and Enobaria, were captured by The Capitol.  Under the leadership of President Coin of District 13, Katniss, Gale, Finnick, and other soldiers will try to unite the Districts, infiltrate The Capitol, and rescue Peeta and the others.  For Katniss, she has one more goal... to kill President Snow.<br /><br />Sounds action-packed, right?  Well, it is.  But the writing did not do those ideas any justice.  Everything felt rushed, especially towards the end.  Things were just starting to heat up and then I noticed that there were only about 25 pages left. Told in Katniss' POV, it was like she was merely narrating a story while in a daze.  I think months pass by in the book where nothing much happened.  The deaths of some of the well-loved characters were mentioned in passing.  Half the time, I had nothing to go on.  So and so died and we'll just forget about him/her, okay?  Then what?<br /><br />There were so many things that I was looking forward to in this book and it is just frustrating the way they concluded.  The author could've done so much more.  It had all the ideas but everything fell short.  The changes in the characters were relatively subtle yet it changed my opinion of them drastically.  Halfway through this book, I almost stopped caring for Gale.  Katniss became weak and whiny.  I think the author might be shooting for vulnerability but I wasn't getting that in this book.  All the other characters faded - or disappeared all together - during the second half.<br /><br />And I thought the writing was pretty bad.  Not Twilight bad though, just... uninspired.  It didn't flow well although it was consistent in Katniss' flat tone.  Clearly, emotions and feelings are not the author's strongest suit.  It is readable but not that engaging.  Out of the three books, Catching Fire had the best writing and construction while The Hunger Games had the best characters.  Mockingjay had none of that going on for it.<br /><br />One thing I liked, however, was the way the romance aspect was treated.  I'm a sucker for angst and mix that with the right amount of romance then you'll get plus points from me.<br /><br />Overall, it is disappointing.  Personally, it was frustrating.  Just when I thought I finally found a YA series that I can get behind, the last book has everything I dislike about the genre: bad writing, whiny characters, and a half-assed epilogue.  I guess I'll just stick with the movie.<br /><br />Rating: 2/5.<br /><br />Recommendation: If you liked Catching Fire, don't get your hopes up for this one.  But it's the last book in a trilogy so it's rather pointless to skip it if you are a fan of the series.  If you're just buying off the hype, you can hold off reading this after you're finished with the second book.  You're not missing anything.st forget about him/her, okay?

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It really keeps you reading.... & reading.... two thumps up!!!  the movie doesn't make it justice!!!<br />I think the thing I loved most was beautiful mixture of vulnerability and strength displayed by Katniss. Too often a female lead is shown as being an overly romantic, sappy, and emotional wreck that needs a man to hold her together, but that wasn't the case here. Sure there was tons of love in the book, but it was so often a different type of love. It wasn't the school-girl..
B003HKN51Q|3.0|Don't bother buying the Blu-ray.  Whilst it is entertainining, if you have a quality led and sound system, you will not get the full advantage.

B000JQU4TW|2.0|Unfortunately I didn't like this classic story for many reasons. I downloaded the [[ASIN:B000JQU4TW Free Kindle version]] and read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using the [[ASIN:B004KUP3F8 free smartphone app]].<br /><br />I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... \\"The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary.\\" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. \\"I find people infinitely fascinating.\\" Which he quickly followed up with something like, \\"I pay no attention to people at all.\\" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.<br /><br />The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?<br /><br />My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.<br /><br />This story reminds me of [[ASIN:B002RKSCA6 The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed. Wilde didn't bring any believability to this story.Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail.

1594744769|5.0|Oh my goodness, how I loved this book!  The first thing that drew me to it was, of course, the creepy floating girl on the cover.  And she isn't the only beautiful and haunting portrait in the book.  In fact, there are quite a few.  The story revolves around vintages photographs of children with special talents (all of the photos are real antique prints and most have not been altered).  They are so creepy and beautiful, I just couldn't get enough.  This alone probably would have been enough for me to love the book but, to top it off, it also happened to be a great story!<br /><br />It revolves around a teenage boy named Jacob and his relationship with his aging grandfather.  All of Jacob's life his grandfather has talked about these children and the incredible photos of their talents.  As a young boy, Jacob is enthralled by his grandfather's stories, but as he grows older they grow apart and Jacob stops believing that the children were really as special as they seemed.  In an attempt to learn the truth about his grandfather's childhood and the children's home where he lived during the early part of World War II, Jacob travels to a small Island near Wales where he must try to find the children and the monster that haunted them.<br /><br />The story was so complex and rich that I found myself completely wrapped up in it for days, even after I had finished. Jacob is such a wonderful character.  In many ways he is a painfully normal teenage boy.  He is bored, insecure and somewhat lazy, but he is basically a good kid who just needs some direction in his life.  Watching Jacob's personality develop throughout the course of the book was really something.  By the end of the book he is a brave, confident young man with purpose and drive.<br /><br />Another great thing about this novel is the creep factor.  It isn't a horror novel really, but it is so unnerving at times that I definitely had trouble getting to sleep some nights.  First of all you have the pile of spooky photos, which I've already talked about.  Then, of course the setting is this tiny, rainy island off the coast of Wales and, in particular, a huge decaying mansion that seems to have just been abandoned one day.  Finally there is the monster, this horrible unseen force that is chasing Jacob and is possibly responsible for the deaths of dozens of children.  One word that I could use to describe the whole thing is: haunting.  The creep factor can be seen in the book trailer as well.  (I wouldn't watch before bed if I were you!)<br /><br /> The ending is satisfying but there is room for a sequel (yeah!). This book was just amazing. The pictures add so much to the story and make it really easy to visualize the whole thing.  There is already talk of a movie and according to Rigg's blog Tim Burton has signed on as director!

I am happy with the way the author chose to resolve Christian and Ana's story, and I hope there are more \\"Fifty Shades\\" books in store for us somewhere down the line. Yes, there are the other issues with the quality of the writing that were present in the first two installments: so much of the plot is predictable. Speaking of plots, I felt like this final book had like 750 different plots going on, anbd most of them resolved themselves in a matter of a few pages, but ofh well. This was an enjoyable book to read from beginning to end. I'm quite sad it's over, actually!

1846140935|5.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00IC1GVW0 An Executive Summary of Steven Pinker's 'The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined']]<br /><br />The main argument: We are fresh out of a century that featured two world wars often considered to be the most destructive in history (not to mention numerous inter-state, civil and tribal wars and genocides), and are persistently submerged in news coverage that features more than its fair share of military conflict, terrorism, murder, gang violence, rape, domestic violence, child abuse and animal cruelty. As such, we may be forgiven for thinking that human beings are at least as violent as ever, if not more so. Indeed, many are persuaded that the onset of civilization some 5000 years ago has had none but a de-civilizing effect on the world and its people, and has led to an increasing level of violence as state hierarchies have grown in size and complexity, and military technology has advanced.<br /><br />However, in his new book `The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined', the Harvard scholar Steven Pinker argues that, all appearances to the contrary, an in depth look at the evidence reveals that violence has in fact decreased world-wide and in virtually every category we can think of since civilization began (albeit unevenly in both time and geography, and with a few blips along the way). The evidence comes not only from anecdotal and narrative tales but from an exhaustive look at the statistics, which is altogether very convincing.<br /><br />Specifically, Pinker cites 6 historical shifts or trends that have brought with them a reduction in violence: 1) The Pacification Process: the shift from traditional hunting and gathering societies to state-run societies based on agriculture, which saw a drop in lives lost by all violent means, including both warfare and homicide (when adjusted for population sizes); 2) The Civilizing Process: the rise of kingdoms and the increase of global commerce, beginning at the end of the Middle Ages and extending into the 20th century, which saw another massive drop in homicide rates and other violent crime; 3) The Humanitarian Revolution: the rise of science and enlightenment values in the 17th and 18th centuries, extending into the 20th century, which has seen decreasing trends in religious wars, superstitious killings, slavery, torture, corporal punishment (including capital punishment), and animal cruelty; 4) The Long Peace: The post WWII period, which has seen a massive decrease in wars fought by and between the world's major powers; 5) The New Peace: the post Cold-War period, which (despite popular perceptions) has seen drops in inter-state war, civil war, genocide, and terrorism; and finally 6) The Rights Revolutions: the civil rights era in many Western cultures over the past 50-60 years, which has seen drops in both forgiving attitudes and violence connected to racial and religious intolerance, homophobia, and violence against women, children and animals.<br /><br />In addition to this historical survey, Pinker also tackles the problem of trying to explain why this reduction in violence has taken place (each of these enterprises could fill a book unto itself, hence the generous length of the work--roughly 800 pages in all, and 700 before notes). The first key to understanding why violence has declined is to understand why it exists in the first place, and has been a prevalent feature of our past (and continues to exist in the present). Violent behaviour, Pinker argues, is partly the result of certain aspects of our human nature which incline us to behave violently under certain circumstances. These biological inclinations towards violence were laid down over the course of our evolutionary past as a result of their success in helping our ancestors survive and reproduce in the environment in which they evolved. In other words, the natural inclination to push others around (under certain circumstances) in order to get the good things of life (from a biological perspective) proved to be a successful strategy for our ancestors, and so was passed down to future generations, and ultimately us.<br /><br />Pinker identifies 5 distinct motivators in the name of which violence is committed, each of which with its own unique or overlapping biological backing. These are the so-called inner demons of our nature, and they are 1) Predation: the desire to attain certain ends in the most straightforward route possible (mainly biological resources, such as food, and mates); 2) Dominance: the desire for status and prestige; 3) Revenge: the desire to avenge past insults and injuries; 4) Sadism: the fascination and appetite to witness, and even inflict, suffering upon others; and 5) Ideology: a susceptibility to belief in ideologies (which are often understood as justifying the sacrificing of people that stand in the way of their fulfillment).<br /><br />While evolution may have equipped us with these motivations, as well as the inclination to use violence to attain them (under certain circumstances), evolution has also equipped us with other motivations and faculties that incline us away from violence, and towards peace and cooperation (again, under certain conditions). These are the so-called better angels of our nature and they are: 1) Empathy, in the sense of having sympathy and compassion for others; 2) Self-control: the ability to control our impulses; 3) A Moral Sense, which includes not just an innate appreciation of the golden rule, but other facets as well, such as a susceptibility to beliefs regarding purity, authority, and in-group cohesion. (It is important to note that not all expressions of the moral sense contribute to more peace (hint: see #3 & #5 in the `inner demons' section above); and finally 4) Reason, meaning the capacity to remove ourselves from our own parochial interests, and recognize each individual's interest as being fundamentally equivalent; and also the capacity to identify violence as a problem to be solved, rather than a game to be won, and the ability to offer up solutions with regards to how the problem might in fact be minimized.<br /><br />The evidence that both our inner demons and our better angels are a part of our biological nature come from evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and a host of very intriguing psychological experiments, and is once again very convincing.<br /><br />With regards to explaining why violence has decreased, Pinker points to the idea that in each of the historical shifts away from violence, some historical force (or forces) has acted to enhance the influence of our better angels at the expense of our inner demons. In other words, various environmental forces have worked to elicit the more peaceable side of our nature, and suppress the more violent one, thus leading to less violent behaviour. Pinker identifies 5 historic forces here. They are: 1) Leviathan: the monopoly of violence by the state, which has decreased the rewards of private individuals to resort to violence themselves, and whose efficacy improves as governments become less corrupt and more just towards their citizens; 2) Commerce: the increase in global commerce, which increases cooperation and reduces hostility between states; 3) Feminization: the increasing influence of women in the realms of politics and economics (as women are, by nature, less violent than men) 4) Cosmopolitanism: the increasing exposure to new ideas and other peoples afforded by increased mobility, literacy and media, which decreases parochialism, and increases the range of people for whom each of us feels sympathy; and which also allows for the progress of ideas, which leads us into the final historic force; 5) The Escalator of Reason: the ever accumulating body of knowledge and good judgement afforded by the application of human reason to our questions and problems, which has lessened our tendency to privilege our own interests overthat of others; and which also allows us to see that the cycle of violence is destructive, and provides us with ways of reducing it.<br /><br />This is the most important book of the past decade.

B005UDD1R6|5.0|aVia works just fine for intermediate users who know how to convert files from one format to mpeg4. I recommend RipBot264. It's fast and produces superior results. Once your videos (your mp3 music files need no conversion) have been converted, your file library will be smaller in size and you can stream or copy files over wifi and get great picture & sound on your Fire. An update recently fixed the aspect ratio problem, and you can even stream files from your Fire to other DLNA capable devices such as a PS3 or 360. If you are at all familiar with file format conversion, DLNA, and have some time to convert your files, aVia is a great app.

B000YCLRBA|5.0|I have recently purchased this DVD mainly due to the excellent reviews that it had received. They were entirely right - this production is superb in all respects. I am especially impressed by Renne Fleming, and in particular by her rendition of the \\"letter scene\\". This justly famous passage from Pushkin's Evgeny Onegin (which is perhaps as important to the Russian language as La Divina Comedia is to Italian), that is quoted essentially verbatim in Tchaikovsky's score, must be one of the highest pinnacles of aesthetic achievement both in poetry and music. Renne's rendition of this passage will positively give you goose bumps. It is a no small feat that a singer in her fifties can believably look and act the part of a young woman; she does all that very convincingly, singing incredibly beautifully all the way through. I imagine that Russian can not be a simple language to her, and yet we would never guess this from listening to her. In my opinion this passage alone justifies the purchase of the DVD.  Among the other singers I am especially impressed by Hvorostovsky, but this is perhaps not overly surprising since he is on the home turf in this beautiful romantic music of Tchaikovsky. The blending of Renne's and Dmitry's voices must be one of the most fortunate examples in contemporary opera production. Gergiev leads with his characteristic energy, intelligence and insight; this man is truly impressive, in my opinion one of the handful most exciting conductors of our time.

Her patterns look complex, but her directions are easy to follow. I especially love the design tips at the end of the book.

B003Y5HWMW|4.0|An enticing and well produced TV version of the 1st volume of George Martin's saga ¨A Song of Ice & Fire¨ (which by the way is on its 5th Volume and more interesting than ever). The few licenses the TV adaptation takes in regards to the book and storyline do not diminish the series and if you are reading the books this helps you visualize the fairly complex & entangled web of kingdoms/fiefdoms and characters greatly (the HBO-go app is extremely useful on this regard as well)<br />In summary, if you are expecting conventional stories where the expected heroes triumph/survive most of the time this series is not a for you, but if you are ready to be immersed in a world of fiction only comparable to Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (a definitely rated version of it), you are in for a treat.
0439023521|5.0|My niece kept bugging me to read these books. I thought, okay I will reserve a copy at my local library. After putting the book on hold I saw I was number 1,332 on the waiting list! Whoa. So I decided to fork over the money and buy the set of three books on Amazon.<br /><br />I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The books are great. I really am impressed and not due to the hype surrounding the movie and book series. The books are really well written. Suzanne Collins really expresses the mood of the characters in her writing. You feel the gloom and anxiety in \\"The Hunger Games\\" as if you are there. You just feel the mood of the books. Not many writers can do this. Hemingway is perhaps the master of this in his writing style, and these books are near perfect in expressing what the characters are feeling with very concise style.You simply feel the emotion of the books. It's hard to explain. Only the best writers can pull this off.<br /><br />The pacing of the first book is just great. The story just flows. I never felt like putting the book down, in fact I finished it in a couple of days. I can see why the book has caught fire and will be devoured by hordes of readers. It is that good.
B005LAIGWS|5.0|The first ghost rider wasn't really a complete film in that it felt like there was something \\"missing\\" from the movie.  It felt rushed in the way that a studio gets a script, director and cast then pushes out a movie without fitting all of the pieces together.  Ghost rider 2 worked and I look forward to the next.<br /><br />The script couldn't have been more excellent.  It was tailored to the cast and crew beautifully because all of the characters were fun to watch and I never had to squint my brains acceptably by only giving the movie partial attention, or through drinking/heroin in the eye balls.  I liked nick cage's drive angry for it's campyness but this had campy in spades and, at the same time, was fun to watch.  I can't think of anyone better to play blaze than nick cage because it's obvious that the part was quite literally written for him (which also is apparent with all of the other cast and crew members).<br /><br />  You may not like this if you like daytime television, you think the cast of friends are hilarious or you've never left a movie saying, \\"that was fun.\\"  If you like to have fun and adventure then you most likely have friends of your own.  Invite them over and watch this movie.
B004IE9REE|2.0|Disclaimer: This review comprises my personal opinion & observations only-Right or wrong.<br /><br />May I suggest that anyone contemplating purchasing this book, 1st borrow a copy from your local library... You can always then come back & purchase it if you still want it.  I was intriqued by the idea that (so I thought) some real scientific methodology results-research was going to be described & enumerated.  Not so.  From my recall of the book, Dr. Turin seems to be a chemist, employed (past or present?) in creating new scent molecules, and his wife is a die-hard perfume lover- I really expected tons of expertly, painstakingly designed & implemented surveys, including control variables, & all the other factors that comprise the scientific method, in reporting a comprehensive list of perfume ratings.  (It's been 20 years since I took research methodology coursework in college, and I am not a scientist).  Rather, the \\"list\\" seems to be a random collection of some fragrances, with the authors' own personal ratings (opinions on quality).  Worse yet, that is not disclosed anywhere, that I can recall.  Many, many, historically beloved frag's are not listed.  Nor is any description at all even attempted, to explain on what basis they selected particular fragrances to review, and conversely, on what basis they decided to leave out so many historically important scents- Oh, wait, they did mention something that may pertain to this- They reviewed whatever free samples they could elicit from perfume manufacturers.  Honestly, they could have contacted me, I own several discontinued, very classic (vintage) fragrances, and if I knew it was for the greater good, I'd have provided sufficient decanted samples- ie, F. Millot's famous Crepe de Chine extrait.  (Or, they could have simply purchased an old bottle at an estate for a few hundred $$, but I guess their operating budget didn't allow for this?) So many old \\"fruit frag's\\" were just fabulous- Not fruit juice swill that permeates the market today, but rather, scents that blended fruit notes & evoked lush, ripe, juicy summer evenings... No attempt was made to make it clear that there was a time when fruits were done right in perfumery :)  (They did, of course include, rightly so- the famously far away peach in Mitsy).  But, as we all know, this was not exactly \\"expertise\\".  Anyone who's loved Mitsouko, knows of it's allure.<br /><br />They do a great job of promoting a lavender scent produced by Monks on a little-known island, which the authors describe as simply the best lavender frag. available.  I would have been so much happier, if at the start of the book, they had simply disclosed that the list of perfume ratings to follow, were their own personal opinions!  I found most of my favorite 'fumes rated by them as \\"masterpeices\\" (5/5 on a scale of 1-5).  But, other loves of mine, were bashed (ie Cabochard- OK, maybe she's not what she used to be, but she's still incredible- Especially when one tracks down a precious bottle of EdP- Just gorgeous!).<br /><br />I'm left with the sense that this couple was simply approached by a publisher, and together they developed a great plan to cash in on their combined expertise in Chemistry (working in the perfume industry, whereas his career could have early-on just as easily gone toward pesticide development or cancer research, etc), and the partner's long term knowledge & love of fine perfumes.  Nothing wrong with this- I was left unimpressed, however.  PS- Only ~ the 1st 1/3 of the book is straightforward reading material, the remaining 2/3 is the \\"list\\" of rated perfumes, including pithy commentary- From singing a 'fume's praises, to bashing the junk.  I guess the Cabochard review rubs me the wrong way- I certainly agree that the vast majority of current mass-marketed spor& celebrity named sporty scents & fruity/florals are worse than wearing nothing- But, to include the long- beloved Cabochard (leather floral) in that category (rated 2/5, or justbarely acceptable, or some such term), doesn't make sense to me.  Also, I did not see any mention that today, the \\"product\\" is the marketing & distribution- (Insert whichever trash juice is being promoted).  Seemed like a typical scientist approach-  Aware of the business of perfumery, but only vaguely, and even less-so than the average savvy perfumista.  Thanks for reading my review, a writer I am not, but nor am I asking anyone for a penny for my opinion :)  By the way, the landscape of scholarly writing on perfumery remains largely a new frontier, in want of contribution!

That in my opinion sums up the books as a whole. Those people that hated these books because of the wonderous vastness are frankly just too stupid to get it, they should stick to the mainstream fantasy books like Twilight or Percy Jackson. Just don't be scared of the vastness and you'll be swept up in the world of the Seven Kingdoms and the 9 Cities Over the Narrow Sea.

B001EBV0OY|5.0|The movie played perfectly with no issues.  I used the live streaming and there were only a couple little lags, but overall it was as good as you can get.  This is also one of if the not the best movie of all time.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Both my 4 &amp; 5 yr olds and I all love this game... it keeps us happy and entertained for hours!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|When I first got this Game I Was so happy and less than a a half hour I was on level 6!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Hi, I will tell everyone this is a great game that suitable for all ages. It is small but smart. I like it very much!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I could not put it this book down. It captivated me and would not let me go.  I think I will read it again right now.
B00634GHJA|3.0|Seems rather pointless to me. If you need to go to your computer and type in a bunch of crap then why not just connect your device? Seems like alot more work for the same results.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|awesome tower defence game!! graphics are fun, simple to play, and its incredibly entertaining the entire time!! free is always appreciated too!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was bought for my kindle and I have thoroughtly enjoyed all three of these books!  I have seen the first movie and look forward to seeing the other two!
B006UN3MRO|5.0|In this second Paddington Bear book, we have a series of adventures that occur between the Summer holidays and Christmas, as Paddington finds himself in trouble with the Browns, Mr Curry, and even the police. As usual, Michael Bond and Peggy Fortnum do an excellent work in this book as the illustrations and text work very well together, and transfer very well on the Kindle. To me that device is just a treat since it allows me to have in my pocket the whole Paddington Bear series, without having to carry a huge bag wherever I go.<br /><br />Of my favourite stories, I'd say that the Bonfire and the Christmas ones were much funny to read, and that the one involving the police was excellent as you see Paddington trying to solve two mysteries  which happened in 32 Windsor Gardens.<br /><br />A great purchase for everyone ready to give a chance to a bear coming all the way from Darkest Peru.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I purchased this for my kindle and couldn't wait until I could get to the 3rd book!  Even though this is fiction, it may be true down the road!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game to play. Lots of fun & can be very challenging. Love it! Great way to pass the time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|No wors could possibly desribe how much I loved this book.  Wonderfully written and greatly emotional, this book remotely reminds me of our society today.  Highly recommend to people at all ages.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|a good story in an easy to read format  i have read the entire triology and enjoyed them  i'll read more
0345803485|5.0|Well, this is definately not your childrens bedtime story!<br /><br />Wow, what a ride for this \\"old\\" lady!  It left my legs trembling and my heart pounding.  I couldn't put it down.  No wonder its the theme of talk around the water cooler.  Holy cow, holy smoke.....lots and lots of smoke!<br /><br />I have never read a romance or erotica book before.  I am a Stephen King and Anne Rice kind of reader.  Whew, this took me by surprise.  I really loved it.<br /><br />I just finished the 2nd book and it is just as smokin' hot.  Can't wait to pick up the 3rd.<br /><br />I really, really hope she writes more of these.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Having devoured a lot of Edgar Rice Burroughs' pulp fiction as a boy in the early sixties, I have always been amazed at how little of the sense of adventure that permeated his writing ever came out in his various screen adaptations.  Some were good films in their own right (the first couple of Weismueler Tarzans, the last couple of Scott Tarzans, and even Lambert's jungle man of later years), but were simply not Burroughs.  Moreover, the exotic settings on Mars, Venus, etc. were mostly avoided due to their effects requirements (the one Pellucidar film, \\"At the Earth's Core,\\" being below average at best).  So, I was quite interested in checking out \\"John Carter,\\" which was tackling perhaps the most effects-heavy of Burroughs' series as well as his best (in my opinion).  After reading some reviews (a few positive, most mixed, and a couple of, frankly, snarky and unworthy efforts aimed at defaming the film's director), I caught \\"John Carter\\" in 2-D with my wife.  We were both very impressed.  It's beautiful, exciting, and a real tribute to how modern technology and a good feel for the subject matter by the film-makers can create a masterpiece!  Moreover, I felt that I was finally seeing and experiencing the Burroughs I had read.<br /><br />I went back to see this movie again in 3D (which didn't add a thing, indeed, I though it was actually better in 2D) and enjoyed it even more the second time around.  It's sad to think that there will probably not be sequels due to the poor box office (for whatever reason, but certainly not the film's exceedingly high quality).  I would have loved seeing the original trilogy done to this level of excellence, with a series carried on to at least \\"The Chessmen of Mars,\\" the fifth of Burroughs' Martian books and, for my money, the best thing that he ever wrote.  I can only compare what is happening to \\"John Carter\\" to what took place long ago with regard to \\"The Wizard of OZ.\\"  That was the most expensive film that MGM had ever made anda big box office flop, which doomed the many wonderful sequels that Baum's great book series might have spawned.  MGM eventually recouped its investment through re-releases (not available today, though perhaps the DVD/cable markets are somewhat akin) and the film went on to become the beloved classic that it is now almost universally considered to be.  I can only hope that \\"John Carter\\" will see a similar future of proper honors.  If so, though not the financial boon to its makers that it should have been, it will at least give them the recognition they richly deserve for creating a true masterwork.  I know that its DVD incarnation will always have a treasured place in my own extensive film library.

B002NT3B52|3.0|She spends a bit too much time trying to use three syllable words and then over explaining the most basic and obvious information.  It had it's interesting moments, but the style was too cerebral and bland.  It could have been a great book, but you get the feeling she is \\"talking down\\" to you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game does have a way to get back to the home screen.all you do is go to your stuff in the bottom right hand corner of the game then go to options and the little arrow thingy pops up on the bottom of you lr kindle.you touch..and then you touch the house button thing and vwalla! YOUR WELCOME!!!!!
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Very suspenseful.  I read it straight through one Sunday, I literally couldn't put it down until I got to the ending.  I love this author's style.  Will be reading many more of his novels in the future, that's for sure!

B000002H1T|4.0|The Cars walked away at the top of their creativity with this innovative album.The synergy of the Cars at this  point in time was at a unique rock pinnacle..  Ben Orr always missed and Ric Ocasek forever idolized.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|4.7 stars<br /><br />First, the film. Is there a more sumptuous and accurate visual depiction of the Elizabethan Age somewhere else in cinema-land? Pray tell, as I've not seen it. The care for detail and feel from the art directors and costumers here is lush and stunning. That alone makes this worth watching for fans of the period.<br /><br />Likewise the language; Orloff turns many a phrase with great aplomb, and his words flow beside the words of The Bard quite well: no mean feat indeed. Rhys Ifans is extraordinary, though the main fault in his performance lies in the script--more humor is needed! WS was one very very funny guy, and that's missing here. But this is played more as Greek tragedy than bawdy Chaucerian comedy, so it's understandable.<br /><br />The direction is excellent, with non-stop mind-boggling detail from both the sights and sounds, never a dull moment for any intelligent mind, and I was amazed that Emmerich could have this much feel for historical drama after seeing some of his bombastic popcorn flicks. But good on him for taking this much time and effort to produce a real piece of eye candy for period film fans. And his brilliant idea to make this a play within a play within a film dovetails perfectly with WS's own frequent dissections of the layers of reality within the artifice of theater.<br /><br />The plotting is fascinating, presenting a wild yet mostly plausible historical scenario despite various inaccuracies (this is historical fiction, after all), which brings us to the whole did he or didn't he aspect. In short, this film is for those who love WS's work above all, and are not blindly obsessed with who wrote it.<br /><br />Let's be honest: whatever the name of the writer or writers of Shakespeare's frighteningly brilliant canon, the real author is The Muse, or God or whatever you call that spirit that lifts artists into the realm of deep truth. That WS was so possessed so often is the real mystery, whoever he or even they might have been.<br /><br />I find it rather funny and not a little ironic to see how painfully anal some &#34;scholars&#34; can be on this issue (you know, those folks who can't write well enough to live from it, so they have to write about those who could. In other words, a large chunk of Academia. Ouch! If that stung you, imagine what Shakespeare would say about your hero worship...). And miss the forest for the trees much? The real author was clearly brilliant enough to enjoy the mystery, and probably even stoked those fires on purpose out of a sheer love of mankind's endless stupidity. Who invented fire? Does it matter? What counts is that it warms our hearth and cooks our food and lights our way.<br /><br />And so with the works of Shakespeare (but best to burn the collected volumes for maximum warmth). One fact most anti-Oxfordians conveniently ignore is that the children of the actor William Shakespeare could not even write their names; they all signed their papers with an X. That's how the finest writer of perhaps all time educated his kids? Sure it is.<br />And how could a man who'd barely traveled and who didn't speak Greek or Latin or Italian know so much about those tongues or histories or lands?<br /><br />But once again, the main thing is the words he/she/it wrote. And those words are and will forever be truly golden, as the scenes here make so clear. His words ring so true in context of all the drama here, and the Babelsberg extras in the Globe scenes seem truly transfixed by them. Imagine seeing the first production of Hamlet!! The mind fairly reels.<br /><br />And that's what I loved most about this film: the filmmakers' sheer love of the work itself shines through (like me, they seem more amazed by the thoughts than obsessed with who wrote them). And a true bonus here is the commentary by Emmerich and Orloff, one of the best, most revealing and detailed commentaries I've ever heard. I was even more impressed upon finding out how they'd made this, and how incredibly skilfully the green screen was used. I watched it on dvd, but I'll be getting the blu-ray to really appreciate the wondrous costumes and sets. I almost never do that, but this is a film worth watching many times just to take in the many many details.<br /><br />The director and writer also make some very convincing points for the Oxford argument, but if you're one of those folks for whom the pedantry of endless authorship arguments is more vital than the sheer beauty and scope of the Bard's wisdom, then I can only say, good luck with that.<br /><br />Those who understand that Shakespeare is just a name attached to some of the finest thoughts ever written down by any human will continue to focus on what matters: the wit and wisdom of the work itself. The rest is merely smoke and mirrors. It's the truth within the words that makes the Shakespearean canon literally beyond belief, and Anonymous does those words justice in many ways.<br /><br />A gorgeous film that will no doubt be regarded as a true period classic in time.redibly skilfully the green screen was used.

630305904X|1.0|I want back the two hours I spent watching this garabage... She did not even resemble a man nor did her acting.  Billy Zane was also pretty wretched.  Overall the movie was too light, never giving any of he characters depth. Don't waste your time.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have never reviewed a book before, but I absolutely loved this book. It reminds you of that crazy, messed up, doomed relationship you had. The characters and relationships were so real that you couldnt help but invest in them. I read this book in 2 days... I def. recommend this book!
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I liked the first book -- very much -- I liked the premise - the characters were well developed.  The visual descriptions were well done -- and at the end of the first book I was looking forward to the second book.  The second book was just a twist on the first with predictable outcomes and the third was more of the same.<br /><br />I did not like the technique of skipping forward with no explanation.  The author was very detailed until she skipped - I kept wondering if I had inadvertently missed a few pages.  The skipping ahead with no explanation was so out of character for the rest of the book.<br /><br />And, of course, the vivid descriptions will transfer to an action movie - or three - I wonder if any studios have thought of that too.(just kidding)

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I finished this series in one week-end.  I could not put it down. This is really a great love story.  Christian the tortured soul and Ana the woman that might be able to bring him from the dark into the light.  I have re-read each book several times which is something I never do. I think these books are so much better than \\"Twilight\\".  I can't wait for the movie!!!!!

B002MQYOFW|1.0|so all of my friends were reading this book, and they told me that i simply had to read it. the reviews looked great, so i tried it. that was one of the largest mistakes i have had the misfortune of making in my life. don't get me wrong, i love the idea, but this book was an execution failure. being an avid reader, this book frustrated me to no end. the flow was choppy and many sentences sounded awkward, and a bunch of other tiny little things add up and make this book painful to read. i read the whole series, and this first book is by far the best of the series, but thats like saying that your child is the best student in the special class. the series only gets worse and the plot just gets more and more unintelligable. like i said, good idea, terribly executed.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very fun reminds me of old schhol Mario. you should deft give it a try and best of all its FREE!
B004UA8D2S|3.0|I wanted something visually dramatic and action-packed to enjoy in escapist big-screen Blu-ray glory on a Friday night and that's exactly what I got here, but I can't say the movie was particularly good. I found myself disliking all of the characters and thinking that this dour bunch really took the fun out of exploring an amazing cave system. If you aren't watching this on an HD home theater system, don't bother.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, the story was so compelling. As an avid hiker, I connected with the author, but I think it would be an enjoyable read for those that do not hike.
B00634GHJA|5.0|this app is very helpful for someone with the android modified touch pad. it is very inconvenient to plug in the transfer cable and go to USB mode on a touch pad. already gave other applications for music and documents, but a pretty easy and fast way to get pics on your tablet from your PC. especially since the hp touchpad does not have an SD card reader.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is amazing!! Even though I had already read the book that my friend let me borrow, I just wanted that book to be my own! So I decided to buy it and it was GREAT!!!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|With all the hype about the movie I wanted to read the book first, the books are always better...I read all 3 books in 3 days. I couldn't put them down. I still haven't seen the movie, and don't know if I will, I don't want to be disappointed. I love the books so much! What if I see the movie and it doesn't live up to the books, like the Twilight series? I'll be so sad! The books kick butt! Buy these books!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|A Song of Ice and Fire is complex and deep read. George R. R. Martin is a true master of epic fantasy and it shows.

B005GG0MIS|1.0|I would like to read this kindle edition, but the purchase price is over the top!  I guess the high cost of hardcovers really isn't, as often said, due to the actual publishing & distributing process.  Wonder what the high cost is due to?
B007Q476KU|4.0|Great movie. Loved the screen shots. A pick hard for younger viewers to understand what the characters are saying to each other.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|In my case the performance it's alright for my needs ( video edition and pics retouch ) some not heavy games.<br />But I don't really like and regreat about the purchase is how noisy is this core ( the fan ) sounds like a F1 racing !!<br />I don't think I have a bottleneck in my system ( 16GB Ram ) Nvidia GTX550 Ti because the fact of just surfing on the web this friend reminds you that its 8 cores are screaming !<br />I don't know out there if someone else has this issue..<br />performance 5 stars for my needs... but doesn't deserve it because of noise!<br /><br />Update on April 23rd,2012<br />The noise is gone, I spent 2 days installing my applications,games ( PES 2012, COD Black Ops,Crysis ) and yesterday at nighy I noticed<br />the annoying noise had gone..<br />Maybe was thermal grease??unfortunately I don't have the noise reason, the important thing here is I will have a quiet environment.<br /><br />Changed my rating from 3 to 5
0307474259|2.0|I read the book and frankly was bored with the eventual repeats about carbs.  It did take a while to get there but once there it was repeated for the balance of the book.  I've been on every high protein diet that has been on the market, from those advising 100% animal products to those in the 40% category and everything in between.  It's the way I like to eat and it feels wonderful to hear your sins aren't bad for you after all.  The problem is that ALL of these approaches have made me fatter, sent blood pressure and cholesterol straight up and caused blood sugar difficulty once I started adding the advised lower level of carbs back into the diet.  After twenty-two years of these diets it took a toll on my kidneys.  They are currently at 47% of what they were before I started Hi-Pro diets. The concept that our friends in the cold reaches of our country are healthy because of a heavy animal based diet is nuts when you consider their average life span for men is 62 years and for women 65 years.  Take it a step further and look at an African tribe (not used specifically, but live a similar life style to that suggested) that lives on the milk and blood of its cattle as a healthy when the average life span for men is 42 years and for their women 45 is sort of nuts.  They don't live long enough to develop heart disease.  I'm not sure but it just makes more sense that man developed and was selected based on the foods available in a region.  Those that had genes compatible with the food sources available lived to pass on their genes those that didn't died out early.  It makes sense that there are variations based on individual genetic history of groups.  The reason that Asians do so well on rice is because they've been eating it for 10,000 years.  The same goes for corn and potatoes in the Americas and wheat in the Middle East.  From what I have studied it seems that once a group that was healthy by eating their traditional foods moves off to ANY OTHER way of eating they will get sick, fat or both.  The key has to be to discover your ancestry as a base and listen to your body to fine tune the results.  The idea that our ancestors had to sit around and figure out what percentage of a macronutrient was required is counterintuitive.  They ate what was available based on season.  There was no balance and therefore our bodies developed to handle excess in one period and shortage in another, and I'm not just talking about calories.  This must apply to nutrients, otherwise how could have mankind survived over the centuries?  You need to eat enough to fill your stomach and be satisfied without increasing the calorie intake to levels you can't burn.  Exercise isn't the solution.  The more you exercise the hungrier you get.  Yes, exercise will make you more fit, but fit doesn't necessarily mean lean.  The only way of doing this is to base your meals on your traditional starch stable and add veggies, meat and fat as an afterthought.  Why do some of us have reactions to that staple? I believe because we are the products of two parents and both aren't always from the same genetic background and we develop sensitivities.  I'm going on to my next effort and I have pre-ordered the book the Starch Solution with the hope that this will be the last diet I will ever be on.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its very user friendly along with quite a few translations that I need!!! Thanks you version!! I totally recommend this to anyone !!
0307454541|5.0|After seeing the movie I had to read the series because I knew the books would be way better (the movie was good though). At first this novel seems pretty dry and I had to force myself to get through it as quickly as possible but, as I kept reading I envisioned the movie as well and I think this took away from some of the fun of the novel. But, no way can I mark down a book cause of my actions! This is great, I really recommend this series to anyone that wants a dark mystery series with some twists to it. 5/5!

0307719219|4.0|Repetitive and too long. Short on defining and operationalizing some of their terms. But the themes -- that oligarchic political power and economic exploitation threaten broad economic success -- are more important today than they've ever been. Sure, I might have liked if the authors did their tour of history in about half as long a book. I would like it if they'd spelled out the argument separately from the examples that they hope to prove it with, so that the overall gist wasn't always buried in the details. But the message seems to me to be worth the slog.
B00263HWM8|1.0|WOW, this movie is bad. Not bad/entertaining, just plain BAD.<br /><br />I mean, I didn't have high expectations based on the genre, casting, etc., but this wasn't even coherent. The editing was awful - they could've shortened the movie to 90 minutes by cutting down on the footage of the ocean that was interspersed with the final hand-combat scene (seriously, it was hero, villain, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, hero, crashing ocean, villain, crashing ocean, hero, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, villain, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, crashing ocean, hero, villain, hero, villain, crashing ocean...I know this seems like I'm just being dramatic, but I'm not).<br /><br />The story went from being thin to ignored to irrelevant and then, when they tried to pick it up again after the -seriously, no lie- 15 minute final hand-combat scene, I'd forgotten most of it and no longer cared.<br /><br />This movie was so terrible that I regret the rental expense; think about it, I watched with one other person which makes the investment less than a couple of dollars each and it was still 10x more than the movie was worth.<br /><br />If you're interested in action movies, MI:3 and MI:4 were both considerably better movies (still pretty crazy, but at least done well, engaging, semi-logical). Save your money and see one of those instead. If you've already seen them, see them again...or watch the TV screen when it's powered off...or stare at a wall...clean the grout in the neighbor's guest bathroom...go to the library...do anything else, but don't bother with this movie.

0440243688|1.0|To us aging male espionage hero wanna-be's, Jack Reacher is the perfect alter ego.  Having never served in the special forces, or the seals,  MI5, the CIA, or even the \\"M.O.U.S.E,\\" I must wholly speculate about what passes for real and unreal when I read espionage thrillers.  Jack Reacher SEEMS like the real McCoy, competent, but slipping a bit, as one inevitably would be after years away from the trenches, and out of training. Listening to this story unfold through Jack Reacher's brain was a nice tease. It had me always looking forward for more, all the way to the end.<br /><br />But then it ended, I started thinking about it.  And I felt cheated.  Every work of fiction, in every medium, must make us suspend our disbelief.  Until he began to reveal answers toward the end, Child did that.  But having finally been told the answers, I found myself thinking, about every single character except Reacher himself, \\"I don't believe it.\\"  Bottom line, Child packs his story with implausible facts and implausible motives.<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT--Plot revealed in the following].<br /><br />Some examples:  Ostensibly a master of details, Child makes it important, half way through, that a portable computer flash drive is \\"too small\\" to contain the intelligence information forming the core of the story. Later, we find out the \\"information\\" consisted solely of a photograph, nothing else. (In fact, even a TIFF file, reproducing a 35mm image at an extremely high 4000 dpi will be just 60mb in size, well under the capacity of the smallest flash drives in this decade). This implausibility sets the stage for much worse ones to follow.<br /><br />Later, we're told that the crucial photograph contains a 20-year-old image of a US Senate candidate, taken during his special forces days, making friendly with Osama Bin Laden. Child requires us to believe that this photograph is deemed so embarrassing that US intelligence agencies have fielded some 600 agents to destroy it before it goes public, if necessary, killing innocents along the way.<br /><br />Still worse, Child tells us that this same photograph contains \\"something\\" so embarrassing/threatening/horrific to Al Qaeda, that they are likewise determined to prevent its disclosure. So they deploy 22 of their best field agents to the US in a suicide mission to get the photo.  Clearly, here Child finally realizes he's painted his plot into an irretrievable corner. Because, though I read to the end to find out, Child NEVER tells us what that embarrassing/threatening/horrific information consists of.  He just kills off all the cardboard Al Quaeda folks in a final dual to the death.  Convenient bail out to a plot that's come from nowhere, and ended no where.<br /><br />In hind sight, therefore, this book turned out to be just one long chase scene, without the reader ever feeling like there was anything really worth chasing.  Fun this first time, but you fooled me once.  You won't fool me again.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|So I just recently heard about the Fifty Shades of Mediocre phenomenon that has been leaving housewives gasping for breath and fanning themselves and I kinda get it. I read most of the book and skipped parts that were too bogged down in useless detail so I understand what made people love it and hate it. The book does have that simple, unsophisticated quality that makes it readable by most fifth graders,but there is NO type of intellectual stimulation. The character of Anna is relatable in that she suffers from low self-esteem and is finally finding her voice and control, but aren't we sick of that same tired, female lead character? I mean why can't a strong, confident Lisbeth Salander type of character be the female lead in a very sexualized loved story? The book does evoke Twilight for the millions of fans across the world, but I CANNOT STAND Twilight!!! After reading the first book when she finally agreed to leave his 'FIFTY SHADES OF CRAZY' behind I was intrigued about what happens next. However, I will not pay amazon another 9.99 to read some semi-amaeteurish story about recycled Twilight characters. I would read it if it came on fan fiction, but never will I pay to read the second part of this soft porn novel. I've read steamier books with more depth and loved them so I am not squeamish about BDSM. The story was just ok, not spectacular. PLEASE DON'T MAKE THIS INTO A MOVIE!!!!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I have ALWAYS loved Fawlty Towers. I only reason I purchased the remastered version is for the interviews. I enjoyed them immensely. My question as to why the series wasn't continued has been answered. Apparently there had been enormous pressure to continue the series, but John Cleese and Connie Booth didn't want to continue them because they really believed they had reached their goal with the 12 episodes.<br />I also did not know that Connie Booth is an American actress. Another surprising thing is that The Builders episode is John Cleese's least favorite episode (it's my favorite).<br />I also enjoyed the interview with Andrew Sachs. It was interesting to find out that his first language is German.<br />I wish Connie Booth had also participated in the interviews. Apparently she has always refused to comment on Fawlty Towers until 2009 in a documentary. Too bad. I would have loved to hear her thoughts on the show.<br /><br />If you're not interested in the interviews, don't purchase the remastered version. The interviews are the only difference. I'm glad I got it. I did recoup 3/4 of the money back, by selling my older set.

B006IGZX0C|5.0|Having lived during this era, the events did not surprise me.  This southern attitude was not limited to that locale.  The hospitality screamed of a demarcation line between races.  It was most enjoyable to find the \\"colored\\" folks take hold of courage and dignity to declare their independence from tradition.  I am happy this movie was made since there are so many of us living today who can relate to that period in time, who can see the injustice that people endured just to survive.  This is a classic which should be shown over and over again so that the youngsters of today can understand why people feel about others the way they do.  This feeling is not limited only to African Americans but also to all races who are subservient to others.

B0071DJZZA|5.0|This book is definitely one of the best I have ever read. It is a bit gory, but it is amazing regardless.<br /><br />At first, I wondered why everybody was going about this book when the movie came out. I was puzzled by how a book called The Hunger Games could be so addicting, 'cause after all, it didn't sound very interesting. I changed my mind after I read the book.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i think it's  a fun game for all.  i do have to watch my 5 yr old a bit but we all love it.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|Not only is this a great Western, but the music from Ennio Morricone is haunting, and I mainly bought the movie for the music.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I was very excited to purchase this DVD after all the fine reviews it received.  There are some adjustments to the 25th anniversery edition that make sense given the venue of the Royal Albert Hall.  For example, the chandilier did not come crashing to the stage due to safety considerations.  However, the musical has a wonderful \\"energized\\" feeling about it that makes it a pleasure to watch.  The three main characters, Sierra Boggess (Christine), Ramin Karimloo (Phantom), and Hadley Fraser (Raoul) blend their characters very well.  A bonus of this rendition of POTO was the treo sung during the graveyard scene between these three characters.  I personally thought the ending was a little strange, with Christine sharing emotions of love and loyalty with the Phantom before leaving the underground lair with Raoul.  After all, earlier, the Phantom tried to set her and Raoul on fire, and vowed to destroy both of them.  I suspect this ending was a segue for ALW's \\"Love Never Dies\\", a disasterous adventure to be saved for a review at a future date.<br /><br />Anyone making this purchase will truly enjoy the Blu-Ray quality, and the detail of the production is outstanding.  I would highly recommend.

B0002V7OI8|4.0|I watched this movie several years ago (in VHS) and I was flummoxed at my own response to it. I usually reserve tears for truly emotive, thoughtful and high-minded works of art, and at first I thought this would be a low art exponent, but boy! It was awesome and it made me think like for 2 weeks about mortality, our universe and how precious life is!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Really fun and simple. I did not like the difficulty collecting acorns, though. That is hard to do without paying.
B0035G0U2O|4.0|I don't go for any Hollywood so-called blockbuster crap and I consider myself intellectual and not easily swayed to just any movie or work of art that doesn't have a workable sensitive morale relevant to our times, so yes, I disagree with the poor designations here. I thought this movie was very good and it had a good message relevant to human civilization itself and its history. So ok a few scenes were corny but the overall movie was nicely done and it was much more than a story about a global disaster. Buy it if you are intellectually and emotionally sensitive enough and embrace the main message of humanity in the midst of geological and environmental maelstrom...You will like this movie!

B005RJ6DUK|5.0|Robert DeNiro almost always excels on the screen.  In this movie, he is a normal guy in the neighborhood just trying to help his family and raise his son the right way.  The interaction between him, Chazz Palminteri, and the son is very special in its development.  The soundtrack is almost like another character in the film.

0393338398|5.0|This is a great book. If you liked the movie and have a passion for baseball the book you will enjoy even more.
0345803485|1.0|Horribly written, way too long, boring, repetitive, this \\"story\\" could have been condensed into one book. Let me point out some obvious grievances:<br />-If I had a nickel for every time the author repeats these words: Inner Goddess, Holy Cow, My Subconscious, mercurial, sardonic, or back-flip, I would be a very rich lady.<br />-It's 2011, Ana is a senior in college and has never had an email account before meeting Christian Grey?<br />-It's 2011, Ana is a senior English major in college, and does not have a computer?<br />-Ana has never kissed a boy and she is 22? Yet has a wild orgasm her very first time having sex?<br />-Ana refers to her vagina as \\"my sex\\" Huh???<br />-Without giving anything away, is anyone else bothered by how quick of a time period this story takes place?<br />My list could go on and on...<br />I can't believe this lady is making $5M on' a movie, when there are many more talented and gifted writers out there struggling. Just goes to show you its not always about quality.<br />I'm in a book club. An avid reader. I hate not finishing a book. Therefore, since each book of this series ends without an ending, I'm forcing myself through book 3...Take my advice, you've been warned, save your money, don't buy into the hype.

B004WR125O|1.0|I really, really wanted this to work. I connected this to my TX-8050 and it worked fine - As long as my wireless router was within 3 feet of the stereo. I tried changing channels on the router, etc. Didn't help. 15 feet away with no walls I was getting 58% signal in the status display. 28% everywhere else. Obviously, the UWF-1 needs more than 58% to work. This could have been my router, but it is hard to believe since I can use the wireless in my barn - 300 feet away. I was unable to find alternate usb wireless adapters with longer range on the web. So, I ended up running an ethernet cable.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy this game because it has a variety of games to play with manu more to unlock. The only problem i have would be this high score you have to beat before you can complete/win the game. I would really enjoy the game if there were slightly lower scores to beat. I have been stuck on the snake game forever now and ive had many friends tried to beat it an cant either. This is my first time coming back and play this game in a while because im so frustrated over that game. Other tjan that i would say this is an overall  fun hame to play.

B006MW3VGA|2.0|I purchased the Season 2 instant video first in non-HD, and then in HD at the recommendation of Amazon due to awful visual quality, only to find that the quality of the HD version is also terrible! Season 1 came through crystal clear so why there is a difference with Season 2 I don't know...maybe because these are the original UK versions (the only thing available at present - my Season 1 is the US version)? Judging by the other reviews I am the only one who has experienced this, so maybe it is my computer although I doubt it since everything else I watch is fine.  I have been enjoying this series so I am very disappointed and hope the problem is \\"fixed\\" soon.
0451457994|5.0|I like most readers experienced the classic Stanley Kubrick film first.  Also like most, I was confused by the often times slow and deliberate pace of the film.  I loved the film but at the end was confused as to what had just happened.  The film was fantastic, but I find it highly complimentary to this novel. Together they explain the excellent story put forth by Kubrick and Clarke.  This is an excellent sci-fi story, although complex.  Having seen the movie first I had a good idea how the story would end.  However I found the novel GREATLY enhanced the movie.  I'm unsure of a proper order of operations versus film and novel, but through personal experience I recommend movie then novel.  This way the novel would fill in the gaps recently produced by the excellent film, and further explain what you have just watched.  A sure fire five star book and for that matter film, get this book!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I heard of good things about this movie from many people over and over again so I purchased this DVD and brought it with me to a family ski trip. My parents were visiting me and my wife from South Korea (Thanks for Korean subtitle) so I thought it would be a good movie for all of us to watch and hopefully open up some meaninngful discussion becaues my family needs some healing. After a hard day of snowboarding and skiing, we finally put everyone in the same room and hit the play button.  After a bit slow start, this powerful story line began with genuine and clean humors.  I mean Hollywood movies generally these days make people laugh mentioning something in race, gender, class, sexualality, profanity or outright grotesque act but this movie doesn't and that is rare these days.  The movie portrays four cops and this hard-working and honorable hispanic man (a.k.a snake king) and the families represented by them. many moments of laugther, joy and sorrow. pretty much all Drama genre movie can offer.<br /><br />What's more important than this movie, especially for my familly was what happened after watching the movie.  We've had never had any family discussion about a theme or a plot of any movie in the past but this movie softened our hearts and opened us up to talk.<br /><br />I heard other viewers who were taken aback by the strong element of Chrisitan faith and mention of its Author, Jesus Christ. I've also read that the movie sends a message that believing God and horornig Him is the best way to be a good father. It looks like this movie has done its purpose and the rest is between you and God.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I feel this book was well written, and was one of the best book it have read yet. It was a great combination of vampire and witches in the story. I loved reading about Oxford !!!!!!!!!!

B0054LVP3Q|4.0|Aha! What a brilliant thriller! No spoilers in this review, but I knew something was off. There was the subtlest of clues spattered throughout the journal entries. I had heard a lot of good things about this novel. And read a few reviews today where people thought the writing was horrible. I can't say I agree with the ones who disliked it. I'm not much one for literary reads, I prefer utter entertainment. And I was definitely entertained with this one. I loved the characters and felt the tale moved along at a wonderful pace.<br /><br />I wonder how difficult life would be if you had such a case of amnesia? Everyday having to relive everything. Marriages, births, deaths and even family members. Makes me think of my poor grandfather who had Parkinson's and had to be told everyday that his son wasn't coming to visit him because he'd died of lung cancer. Tragic. And what happens to poor Chrissie is even more tragic. Plain and simple, I liked this book. It's so different than any other thrillers I've read. What's next Dr. Watson?
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love how easy this Solitaire is to use.  It works flawlessly on my Kindle Fire.  Ads only appear at the start of a game.

1400044162|5.0|I'm giving fewer and fewer 5 star reviews these days, so when I say this book was absolutely fantastic, I really mean it.<br /><br />Half of a Yellow Sun is set in Nigeria in the 1960's, covering both the early years of independence and the Nigerian-Biafran war. The story is told in third person through the eyes of three main characters: Ugwu, a teenage boy from a poor village who becomes \\"houseboy\\" to a professor, Odenigbo; Olanna, a rich, foreign-educated Nigerian woman who settles down with Odenigbo and becomes a sociology lecturer; and Richard, a Englishman who comes to Nigeria to study art but falls in love with Olanna's sister Kainene, who runs a contracting business. (I think this is a better description of the characters than the blurb's, which describes Olanna as Odenigbo's \\"beautiful mistress,\\" as if she were nothing but a sexpot. Actually, they're just like many a modern couple: living together in a committed relationship but unmarried.)<br /><br />The characters are the best thing about this book. The plot moves a bit slowly, but the characters are so utterly three-dimensional and fascinating that there isn't a dull moment. They feel like real people, with complicated motivations and reactions and relationships, in a way that precious few fictional characters do. To the point that I'm actually looking at other books differently (the one or two that I reviewed while reading this one really got the short end of the stick).<br /><br />This is also a fantastic piece of historical fiction. One reason I read this genre is to learn about the world, and this book has a great sense of place and relates the brief existence of Biafra in a way that's engaging, understandable and memorable. The structure--with the book divided into four parts going back and forth between the early and late 60s--helps with this; it allows readers to step back and see how the countries and the characters got to where they are in the late 60s, and also keeps the book from being overwhelmed with war and tragedy. One common problem with books focused on some great tragedy or atrocity is too little build-up, but this one gives readers ample time to get to know and care about the characters and the place before the shooting starts. And the early-60s sections don't just introduce the characters but have enough depth that they could have been a novel on their own.<br /><br />I should note that the war sections are very focused on the characters' individual experiences--I was surprised when someone referred to the \\"millions\\" of people in Biafra, because it felt much smaller than that. But this is one of the book's many strengths, that it's able to focus on a few people's lives rather than turn into some kind of political treatise. We find out early on that a character writes a book about Biafra called \\"The World Was Silent When We Died\\"--but this is not that book. It's far more subtle than that.<br /><br />Finally, the writing itself is excellent. Neither overly ornate nor simplistic, it's the kind of old-fashioned good writing that's technically good but without calling attention to itself. And there are thematic questions that I'm still trying to work out (what Richard's role in the book says about white people in Africa, for instance). The closest thing I have to a criticism of this book is of the Author's Note, in which the author states that she took \\"many liberties\\" with the facts but not what they are. (The basic facts of the war, as far as I can tell from basic internet research, seem to have been presented accurately, but like most readers I'm unlikely to do extensive research to ascertain what was fact and what was fiction.)<br /><br />I would recommend Half of a Yellow Sun to a wide range of people: whether you like historical fiction, world fiction or literary fiction, whether you read for story or characters, whether you know anything about Biafra or not, I think you'll find much to appreciate in this fantastic book.med with war and tragedy.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I was  a little concerned because the basis of the Hunger Games, is pretty horrific.  However; I became absolutely immersed in the action, adventure, struggle and fantasy of the plot.

They can just get this app n the other friend can just send the pics in via messaging n the person with the iphone can use this app by downloading the unreplaceable photos or vidios to the computer. I would defenitly recomend this app! :-)

B004LWZWBU|5.0|Because this movie stars three genuinely talented and funny individuals -- Owen Wilson, Jack Black, and Steve Martin -- I expected myself to be laughing silly.  But it was actually far more serious than I thought.  The topic is \\"birding,\\" and I am really impressed that Hollywood managed to make a fast-paced and entertaining film based on such a slow and methodical activity (will they try stamp-collecting next?).  But it's really not about \\"birding\\" -- it's more about the thin line between passion and obsession, and the competing struggles of ambition and family.  Jack Black is usually full of dark and angry energy, but in this film he was likeable, and Owen Wilson does an amazing job of maintaining his likeable goofy demeanour  while portraying an obsessive who is not at all likeable.<br /><br />Very good movie to show the whole family, although you would not want to make a hobby out of \\"birding.\\"

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is a masterpiece!  I can't wait for season three.  I have other friends hooked on this series too. It's worth the wait.
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|First of all - WHAT A GREAT MOVIE.  I saw it in the theater when it first came out, and was utterly floored.  It actually gave me nightmares, which I'm sure was the intention.  It's remained one of my favorite films since then; although I rarely watch it because of its intensity, I've always held it in very high regard.  The script, the direction, the acting, the production values - everyhing just magnificent.  (And I also have a soft spot for Giorgio Moroder's Super70's synth score.)<br /><br />Now about those criticisms...<br /><br />I've never understood the charges of xenophobia leveled at this film.  It's a story told from the point of view of Billy Hayes, a young man sentenced to years in a foreign prison, with no friends or help in the country where his (foolish) actions have trapped him.  OF COURSE he's going to see the people abusing him as horrible monsters - wouldn't you?  And really, the only people I saw that were portrayed as \\"evil\\" were the big horrible prison guard played by Paul Smith, the hard-line prosecuting attorney, and the rather oily defense attorney who really does seem to be trying to help.  So there ARE no horrible abusive prison guards in reality?  There ARE no hard-line prosecutors who are more interested in coups than justice?  Defense attorneys are NEVER the least bit sleazy?  Seems to me the only reason these characters are deemed \\"racist\\" is that it's apparently a sin to portray anyone outside America as being other than nice - as if there were no ugly, mean, selfish, violent people anywhere else in the world.  Sorry, that's dishonest.  Bad people exist everywhere, and it's purely self-serving to insist that filmmakers must never allow such people into their films, ESPECIALLY when those characters are based on REAL people in the original book!<br /><br />As to the differences in the plot, are you kidding?  Do these critics have any idea how horribly mangled a book can get when it falls into the hands of Hollywood producers?  I give this film credit for letting Billy stay male instead of being made into a woman to make him more \\"vulnerable\\", or getting arrested in Aruba instead of Turkey because it's more photogenic.  And hey, kudos to the filmmakers for wanting to use the story to try and fight a horrible injustice, since that's one of the reasons Hayes wrote the book in the first place!<br /><br />Re: the DVD - VERY good.  The best edition so far.  A director's commentary, numerous interviews, and a beautiful photo gallery.  I only wish there were a retrospective \\"making of\\" feature, but as Stephen Wright says, you can't have everything - where would you put it?<br /><br />(WHEN is Amazon going to start listing the extras on DVD's??  I keep having to go elsewhere to find out what's on a disc, and often end up buying it where I can find the info.  GET ON THIS, AMAZON.)
006197806X|5.0|Originally on [...]<br /><br />One spoiler, but come one, like you weren't expecting it.<br /><br />Pandemonium, called the \\"Most Awaited Book of the Year\\" was absolutely amazing! As the sequel to Delirium, one of my favorite books, I was a bit afraid to read it. I mean, no Alex!? Crazy! It's just not possible to make Pandemonium as good as Delirium with no Alex! Was I ever wrong. If possible, Pandemonium was even better than Delirium... except for Julian. I absolutely hate Julian. Lena's struggling to remove Alex from her memories, but that's pretty hard to do when she was in love with him. Now, she's an Invalid. Pretending to be a citizen. A spy! That's what Lena is now, and there's no turning back. Especially when in the middle of a ceremony, \\"Invalids\\" (the bad ones) raid the place and take her hostage as well as one other person named Julian. And maybe, maybe, she just falls one more time. Life for Lena is getting tougher and harder by the second.<br /><br />Pandemonium switches between two different times, \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" and as confusing as it seems, it really wasn't. The \\"then\\" chapters gave you more information on how hard it was for Lena to let Alex go. He was dead. Gone. But I couldn't help wishing otherwise. I mean, if you've read Delirium, you have to love Alex! He was sweet, strong, protective, and definitely sacrificing. Who couldn't love him? But when he...no. Just no! I was with Lena all along the way as she struggled with the nightmares that came to her, and the memories that haunted her. I loved Lena. She was strong in her own way, she stood up for herself, and she now realizes the lies she had been fed her entire life. In other words, she's a great heroine. Not one that has always been strong, but someone who learns the hard way, what it really means to love, to fight for it. Seeing (or reading) Lena go back to her society with a new view on things made you realize how blind humans can be when told the right lies at the right times. How as long as we are safe, we won't care as much.<br /><br />We meet new characters, Raven, Julian, and really? I didn't like either of them. Raven, because although she's been through much, she's hardened so much that she's like stone. Barely anything can penetrate the wall she's built, and no one can go in. Julian because well, Alex! I couldn't believe it when Lena fell in love with him! It was just...shocking to say the least. The difference between Alex and Lena and Julian and Lena was that now, Lena was the Invalid pretending to be someone else, teaching someone what love truly means instead of Alex.<br /><br />The writing was as good as Lauren Oliver's other books. Her writing was like thoughts, a journal, not like someone was actually recording every little thing, smell, touch. It just made Pandemonium more enjoyable. The writing, the plot, it just pulls you in until you can't breathe, can't sleep. Lauren Oliver has done it again with Pandemonium and I'm not even sure where she's going to take Requiem. There are many different directions the story can go. Which one will she pick? With an ending like Pandemonium had, there's no way that readers will lose interest. It was fast-paced, adventure-filled, and romantic at all the right levels. Some questions will be left unanswered, others will make you gasp or scream.<br />Pandemonium will leave you at the edge of your seat, willing for everything to be okay.

B0000027F8|4.0|It is hard to believe that 2012 marks the 30th anniversary of George Michael's career, on his solo works and with Wham!. Musically, he had drifted away from the superstar status he received with his Wham era, and with his solo record Faith. He has shown over the years, that he is a remarkable singer that can do covers that really remain distinctive and appealing to everyone. But when it has came down to his 90's records, Listen Without Prejudice & Older, the world saw a more intimate George Michael, that his label Sony Music didn't want, and he said goodbye in the process. While it was costly, it still showed that George Michael was true to his words, and Listen Without Prejudice Volume 1 showed it.<br /><br />George Michael's 1990 record Listen Without Prejudice: Volume 1 showed a more older and distinctive George Michael that was tired of being labeled as a fad and teen idol from his Faith days in the late 80's. Nevertheless, his music started to stand alone intimately, and worth each note. The songs show well from the intimate Mother's Pride, which is a intimate ode to his mother, whom died of cancer in 1996, to the #1 smash Freedom '90, to Waiting For The Day, and Soul Free, to the Stevie Wonder cover They Won't Go When I Go, to Heal The Pain, which stands nicely, while not as good as when George re-recorded it with Paul McCartney in 2008. His appearance was missing on the cover, as well as his videos, which he wanted to speak for itself. But George spoke well upon the album, deep with the listen of the record. While I was hoping there was a remastered version of this record, as was the case when Faith was re-released last year for its 25th anniversary.<br /><br />George Michael did record a sequel to Listen Without Prejudice, but Sony refused to release it, due to the lackluster potential they wanted with the first Listen Without Prejudice volume, and the sales of Listen Without Prejudice: Volume 1. Nevertheless, it is still a good record that George Michael released, that showed that is older beyond the years the fans had wanted, and good with his music that he recorded from his distinctive heart. If you are new to George Michael's music and his distinctive style, I definitely recommend Listen Without Prejudice: Volume 1 without a doubt, as it shows why George Michael made his music worthwhile.<br /><br />Album Cover: B-<br /><br />Songs: B<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Mastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-leased, that showed that is older beyond the years the fans had wanted, and good with his music that he recorded from his distinctive heart.

B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I bought this app to scan receipts to be submiited with an expense report; although we have an all-in-one ink jet printer at work, the scanning software doesn't always function properly over the network.  I use my phone's camera as a scanner to capture the image of the receipts and generate a PDF file which I send to my office email address.  The image is fantastic! It's as good as one produced by a regular flat-bed scanner using OCR software.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|What a ride! This book was the best kind of rollercoaster. I was up, I was down, I was left, I was right, I was completely upside-down at times. Phew!<br /><br />This story flowed from beginning to end. Never a lag, never a loss of momentum and very well paced. The descriptions were quick and precise. The characters were practically in the room with me they were so vivid.<br /><br />The twists and turns, that laughter and tears. Dear god, I feel like a worn out old washcloth after all that but it was so worth it.<br /><br />There are so many special little moments that I love and that will stick with me forever.  Eddie and the pink balloons, the xmas letter, all of the poems, the Halloween costumes, Basanga, I could go on and on.<br /><br />Excellent book.
1250008409|4.0|I have only meditated a few times in my life, so it is fair to say that I am not even a beginner. More like someone who is interested in the concept but too lazy and unmotivated to attempt and commit to a meditation practice.  I keep considering it, however, because research on meditation makes it clear that it improves health and happiness. I've read a number of books on meditation, hoping that I'll find one that will help me get more clarity on why it works, how it works, and how to get started. Much to my surprise, Get Some Headspace meets all three criteria. But helpful as it is, the book is also an extended advertisement for a website that sells his program. The fees for website content range from $14.95 for a month to $399.95 for \\"forever.\\" I do not think the latter category implies that meditation will lead to eternal life, but I'm not going to spend the 400 bucks to find out. Still, I don't want to let my irritation about the expense of the web content detract from my evaluation of the worth of the book content.<br /><br />I'll get the negatives out of the way first. I was searching for a book on meditation for beginners, and what I found was a book on meditation for dummies. It is aimed at the lowest common denominator, the writing style is unsophisticated, and it could benefit from some additional editing. (For example, I am surprised that an editor would allow the publication of phrases such as \\"quite unique\\" and \\"10 p.m. in the evening.\\" In fairness, though, I have an advance reading copy, and perhaps these errors will be corrected before the book goes to press.) I was also put off by what felt to me like an approach designed as an introductory sales seminar, with frequent references to content available on the web, with no mention that the content was not free (aside from a 10 day trial period).  As I continued to read, however, I found myself underlining many passages and eventually understanding the purpose of meditation in a way I never had before.<br /><br />Among the things I found most helpful:<br /><br />Excellent stories and analogies that take some of the mystery out of mindfulness and meditation.<br /><br />Detailed, helpful exercises that allow the reader to experiment with mindfulness and meditation.<br /><br />Good explanations of why mindfulness is helpful and how a meditation practice can improve one's quality of life.<br /><br />Practical support and guidance for achieving a relatively modest goal of devoting 10 minutes a day to meditation.<br /><br />I am deducting one star for mediocre writing and far too many references to his fee-only website content.  Still, I am quite excited to have found a book that has given me the motivation and guidance to begin a meditation practice. And who knows...I might even try that 10 day free trial one day.<br /><br />Follow-up, January 2014:<br /><br />Well, I bit the bullet and did my 10 day free trial, after which I took advantage of a Psychology Today discount and subscribed to the website for $60 for a year. I have been using the app to guide my daily mediations, and I find it to be very user-friendly. I love how he only asks for 10 minutes a day to start. It is so easy to find 10 minutes. I am now up to 15 minutes, and I really feel a positive difference in the way I think and feel.<br /><br />Another update, March 2014: I have now completed Take 20, and I am absolutely hooked. I have recommended the website to friends, colleagues, and clients. The feedback from others is uniformly positive.<br /><br />Yet another update, November 2014: Meditating with the Headspace app has been an incredible experience. I continue to recommend it to others, and I have received some heartfelt thanks for turning people on to Headspace. Meditation has helped me get some perspective on my feelings and it is now easier for me to note a negative feeling and then let it pass. It has also improved the quality of my sleep. I am really grateful to Andy for helping me move from beingcurious about meditation to being committed to it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I finished the first two books very quickly and it took me forever to get through this last one... the storyline got flat, the main character \\"Katniss\\" began to annoy me and the other characters that I really liked were either killed off or their inclusion in the story was very limited in comparison to the first two books.<br /><br />I feel as if the author rushed to finish the trilogy and not as much care and thought was put into it. Very disappointing...
B007SGM084|5.0|I so loved this book. There are quite a few of us at work that have read it and all of us say the same thing. We would like to read more. Soooo did not want it to end. Hope you write more about these characters.
0439023513|5.0|The third book of the trilogy is definitely the darkest of the three, but I think it also is the best in that it presents a more real ending than what might be expected when you go to war with a dictatorship.  War doesn't always bring out the best and the brightest and sometimes you end up making alliances with the unsavory.  It also was the ONLY book of the three that kept me riveted to the page.  It was a real story versus an action novel.<br /><br />My 13 year old daughter didn't like it for the same reasons that I did.  \\"The ending was too depressing.\\"  Yes.  It wasn't a fairy tale ending.  I compared it more to the ending of Stephen King's The Stand.  Every serious conflict leaves deep and lasting scars.  You try to rebuild from what is left and you have to move on as best you can.  I don't believe that teenagers need to be kept from this truth.  In fact, they need to learn it to become better people.  Ms. Collins would have done a great disservice if she provided a \\"happily ever after\\".
B00457X7XQ|3.0|I like the topic of this novel and believe much of what happens in this book could occur in reality. That in itself makes the book worth reading. However, I must say that it is to technical for most people and the writing isn't quite up to the standard I'm used to.
B007UXTHSG|1.0|This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen lots of crappy movies. Approximately 30 minutes into the movie I was ready for it to end. The movie suck stunk and I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|She writes this book so well and does not skip on the details. I was suprised that this was published so soon with the grief and healing. She is strong and kept the persona in the care of Phillp just to protect her daughters. I would of cracked way soon but it just shows she is strong harded and had the will to protect her kids.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I've always wanted this app so I purchased it when it's on sale. It's convenient and useful. I wish they had more colors of fonts that I can choose from.
B0060FXBNM|3.0|Though the movie has a excelent video quality, the Blu-Ray boxes otherwise appears to be a cheaper version of boxes in general.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is very good...I just would not want to reccommend it for children under the age of 13 or 15...because of the battle scenes.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Movie gets 5 starts but Blu-ray gets 2.  While the movie is AWESOME...in my humble opinion, the best in the series, the Blu Ray extras are non-existant.  This two disc Blu-Ray set has no real extras.  There are a few weak behind the scenes reels but that is it.  I wish I had known that before I bought it because I would have waited for the 3 disc with all of the extras.
0553582038|3.0|I don't get why people seem to hate this book so much more than the first book or two in this series. It's more of the same; I didn't see a decrease in writing quality at all. I wish you could give half stars, because I don't quite feel this deserved 4 stars, but it's better than your average book, so I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. I'd give books 2 and 3 the same rating, and book one would have half a star more at 4. I have not yet read ADWD, but I plan on doing so soon. I do hope after such a long wait that he gives us closure on a few of the stories that happened in this book, though.<br /><br />The only major criticism I can make of this book is that it adds so many new variables and plot lines to the story that, while good, are distracting to the overall theme. My understanding is that the big picture story here is that the Others (or the Other, the god opposing R'hllor, or whatever prophecy you want to go by) are coming, and somehow this fractured world needs to band together to oppose that which threatens all humanity. That being said, I think we've seen enough of the fracturing -- we need to get to the banding together part already. I mean, AFFC was already supposed to be the first half of a book, and then ADWD was split again. The writing is good, the stories are good, the characters are good, but by the fourth book, I expect him to be setting up for the conclusion, and it didn't seem that way to me.<br /><br />The major criticism aside, this book was very entertaining. The only people who won't like it are those who need constant action scenes and battles and blood and gore to be entertained. This book is the playing of the game of thrones at its heart:<br /><br />- The Ironborn play their own game of thrones amongst themselves and then re-enter themselves into the bigger game of thrones for the Seven Kingdoms.<br />-Littlefinger brings Sansa into his plots and scheming and as he gathers more power for himself, you see that he has big ambitions and is actually a strong contender in the game.<br />- Jaime's character develops even more as he discovers his sister is not all he thought she was, and strives to keep oaths he has sworn, despite being despised by all in the realm for breaking the biggest one.<br />- Brienne discovers that honor is not always the high road, that life is more complicated than black and white.<br />- Cersei plots against the little queen, makes good use of her court torturer, and fails to follow the age old advice of keeping your friends close and enemies closer.<br />- Sam's story....admittedly, is the least compelling of the bunch. It's a bit slow, but of all the stories, it's the only one that seems to be contributing to the overarching theme of prophecy and dragons and saving the world, so I'll forgive him the slower plot line there. His chapters really could've been compressed all into one, though, if they were mentioned at all.<br /><br />While some parts were slower than others, it was solid reading throughout and I was never bored. I do want GRRM to finish, of course, but in the meantime, it seems pointless to get angry over waiting for him to finish. I'd rather enjoy the ride. The first installment so far has been the best, but as of this book, GRRM has not slipped yet.
B002GYS1FO|4.0|Well, I got caught again.  I heard a really neat song on the TV and decided to buy the CD, figuring that would be the only song I liked.  Well, guess what, it wasn't!  If you like bluesy / rock, you should try it.

B007SSDS24|4.0|I don't know why everyone has ripped so much on this film. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it had an intriguing idea-one I've not seen before. I never went to the theatre to see it because of all the negative reviews. Finally, once it was available here, I went ahead and took a chance. Partly, to be honest, because I am a HUGE fan of Joel Kinnaman.<br /><br />Well, I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked it. It's not a movie I'm watching because it's going to be Oscar nominated (besides-I usually don't care for those anyway). It gave an explanation for why the aliens are on Earth, how to kill them and the end left you with hope.<br /><br />It actually reminded me a bit of Red Dawn or the Australian flick, Tomorrow, After the War Began; everything is not wrapped up in a bow but the end leaves you with hope.<br /><br />I don't know what everyone was expecting, but I thought it was worth watching and did so twice. My mom also watched it and really enjoyed.

B001U9BRNE|4.0|David Foster put this event together for Andre Agassi and his foundation.  Foster has such a wide breadth of musicians that began under his tutelage he rarely has a problem getting them to perform for him.  Here we have heavyweights aplenty including Bocelli, Dion, Buble, Groban and Shelton to go along with older stars like Scaggs, Cetera, Kenny G and newcomers Johns, Olstead, McPhee and Charice and smooth jazzers McKnight, Lynn, Benet and Babyface.  Foster's introductions go from awe to his characteristic \\"wow\\" for every performer.  While it often sounds syrupy sweet I have to think he's very genuine.<br /><br />Usually with these benefit collaborations, there are more misses than hits but that's not the case here.  I do think the video smooches by Barbra Streisand and Kevin Costner grinded the event to a halt, but Foster gives them a quick thanks and gets things moving again.  I also though Celine Dion stopping her own Vegas show to do a bit with Foster seemed a bit uncomfortable.  Otherwise, every performer here gave it his or her all.  Who would have thought Katherine McPhee could keep up with Bocelli?  Blake Shelton and Michael Buble perform a duet of \\"Home\\" a hit for both.  For a show stopper check out 16 year old Charice make Whitney Houston fans take notice.  If you like any of these performers you should appreciate this concert.<br /><br />This is the second time I've watched this Blu ray disc and a couple things surprised me.  First, this is a rare release in 1080i, but there was no issue with the transfer.  It's beautiful. Pleanty of sparkle and black blacks.  The other is the sound.  I was watching this video with a new receiver and in a different environment than usual.  I was amazed at how good the disc sounded.  The disc set up and the jacket only suggest that this is a lossy DTS 5.1 playback, but damn if it isn't a lossless DTS-HD MA.  It sounds spectacular.
B007UXSDYU|4.0|Despite other reviews, I thought the acting was rather well done.  You really have to suspend common sense in some parts of this movie because their are things that just wouldn't make sense (5 things come to mind).  My biggest problem with this movie is the ending.  I don't mind when things aren't cleared up in the end but the movie's themes have to be consistent.  Basically, this movie is about a group of people that descend into chaos and primal evil.  I don't want to ruin the movie but discussing the ending but I don't think it fit well for this movie because the surviving character is no better than the other evil characters from her/his deeds at the end.<br /><br />Perhaps, the movie ended this way to setup for a sequel?  Anyways, this was enjoyable and worth renting.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I use the app to quickly connect to amazon app store. It works great and I can easily check for new app or and old one I used before.
0345803485|4.0|I enjoyed reading all of these books. You have to have an open mind when you are a reader and sometimes you read between the lines. It was not about the sex games as much as the healing process. I've never had these kind of experiences but I can read this like a history lesson and learn from it what some people might enjoy. You only live once and life is short!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|This is one amazing book. I recently bought a kindle to encourage reading and it is by far the best decision i made. Im not an avid reader, i find readig boring, but i was able to finish this book in no time and i am now on to the 2nd book in the trilogy. After completin the first one you wont be able to stop there so just save $$ and buy the entire trilogy. Happy reading
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I have been and always will be a life-long Jason Mraz fan!!  This album is fantastic!  You can tell that he pours his heart into every song.  The tempo of the music is different, slower and more mellow than his other albums, but this is probably his best work to date.  This album showcases that he has grown and matured as a musician.  The lyrics in Jason's music are uplifting; that's why I love his music so much.  His music makes me appreciate the things in life that we humans sometimes take for granted...love, happiness, gratefulness.  I'm excited to see him in concert this year...he truly is one of those performers even better live than on a studio album (if that's even possible!)  Can't wait to see what else he has in store!<br /><br />On another note...any artist who quotes Fred Rogers on their album cover insert will ALWAYS be #1 in my book...\\"Understanding love is one of the hardest things in the world.\\"  As a child growing up in the late 70s and 80s, Mister Rogers had a huge impact on my life and taught me so many life lessons!  I only wish his shows were still on TV for our children now.  Kudos Jason!
B0051CSIKQ|4.0|This is more than a good horror movie, it is a good movie overall.  Good solid action and direction with a strong storyline.  In a post-apocalyptic world overrun with vampires and religious zealots we follow Martin and the vampire-killer \\"Mister\\" as they try to make their way to \\"New Eden\\" contending with both the vampires and religious psychopaths along the way.  Overall one of the best horror movies I have seen in quite a while.  I highly recommend it.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|this movie made a lasting impression on my life...and there are actually people in the world who say these events didn't happen.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot...it's for all ages.  Very cute, but I found myself so touched, I cried at times....But I like movies that touch my heart!
B00632HWOG|3.0|ok app with one annoying feature- it pings every time a group of emails come in no matter if the apps running or not. its very annoying and I haven't found a way to turn it off
0345803493|3.0|I enjoyed the 1st book, fifty shades of grey, much more than the second. Towards the end of the book, I found myself forwarding through the sex scenes (because there's so flippin' many it doesn't seem to matter any more) and even through Ana's exposition about how complicated their relationship is. Frankly, I just didn't need to hear it again.<br /><br />There was so much sex (which doesn't bother me) and so much lamenting about the relationship (I love you, no I love you, etc...) that those things in the book became...boring. It was so repetitive that it wasn't special, or new, or interesting.<br /><br />This book isn't bad, I just wasn't \\"compelled\\" to finish it. And I'll read the third. But this book needed some serious time with the editor cutting repetitive things. So much more could've been done with Ana's first job and her career, for example.<br /><br />Many people disagree with me, but I just got bored. I hope the 3rd is better.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I have a hard time finding books that keep me intrested and reading. Well The Hunger Games trilogy is not one of them. I was on the edge of my seat, so to speak, through the entire book/books. I think I read the entire trilogy in a little over one week. If you like futureristic themes books you'll love this one. For me it's a must read, hope you enjoy it.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I often transfer photos from my phone to my computer, and until today I did it via email, which worked, but was a pain in the ass.  This is remarkably easy and quick.  Great app, and one of the very few 5 star ratings I have ever given.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo.com mail app is just as easy to use here on the Kindle as it is to use on the web. The features are the same the design is also the same. If you use Yahoo.com mail app on your phone you will find it easier here on the Kindle, the on screen touch buttons are bigger for instance. Basically it's a good app no matter where you use it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I started reading this book and thought I had the ending all figured out by the middle of the book, I was very wrong about which way the story went. I love that about this book. Usually plots are rather predictable for me, this one threw me and was that much more entertaining for it. the vocabulary was not too young, the metaphors were not overplayed and it was well enough written to keep my interest. The plot was the best part, it seems to be a rebellious attack at our society's thirst for reality television and appearances. I'd recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I agree with so many others. At first I was shocked at the sexual explicity of these books. But once I started I had to keep on and find out what all the hullabaloo was about. For a romance novel, it hit the spot and I did enjoy that part of the plot. I think the sex could have been alluded to, not so graphically defined.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was recommended this book from a friend after finishing the Hunger Games series and I was itching for something more adult but kept my interest. I asked for \\"more adult\\" and I received! This series is highly addictive, yet not necessarily believable, but still page turning and illiciting gasps and blushes while reading around others. This erotic tale is not for the modest or for someone under the age of 18 in my opinion. (S&M and very detailed sexually charged characters) I read this from first to last page within a day and needed to download the next in the series immediately after finishing this book. (My family missed me this weekend.)It left you wanting more, not that the author didn't tie up the story with a bow but because you want more. The second book also doesn't disappoint. I decided to break down and read this series after hearing all the controversy and media hype. I hate romance novels where the woman is not someone I can relate to. (Very beautiful and successful woman that doesn't have a care in the world...blah blah blah; enter man to sweep woman off her feet, life is complete.) Honestly I thought this story line was the same and didn't interest me in the least. I was wrong. I guess there is after all a romantic bone in my body. I enjoyed this series and am only giving my brief review to give myself a break and share my love of this series with someone else without letting my friends and family know what I REALLY am reading on my Kindle. LOL Quite possibly the Payton Place of our 30 something generation. Read it! I had to tell someone about this book without blushing; Amazon Review!
B00634GHJA|4.0|my first app review ever and this is great! wish the file transfer can be more than 2, but overall its an awesome app!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I was reluctant to buy a used product, but when I put the disc on to play, & watched it with a friend, I was absolutely delighted.  It played like the brand new one that I had lost, & since it is my all time favorite movie, am glad that I can now look forward to viewing it over & over again.
B0073U2F12|2.0|well this movie we thought might be a good one to add to our 3D collection--- Sorry but we will probably never watch this again-- It is not exciting and the dvd had some delays during the 3D version- Save your money and just rent it,if you have to see it.
0670916757|2.0|I read a little about this book and immediately thought it was a book that would help me understand almost sx decades of living as an introvert. But the book itself has been a big disappointment. There is far too much autobiography in it in terms of the way topics are dealt with. A early section on working in groups is emblematic of the problem. I have found I often work well in groups with people I trust and respect. Yes, I also can work well alone, but the author wants to do far too much with the vision of the shy genius.It would have been far better to focus on how introverts can learn to work well in groups since most of us, introverts included, aren't Einstein and that is ok. An account of going to a seminar in the bay area for \\"sensitive\\" people spoke to the wounded high school geek in many introverts, but wasn't helpful to developing a healthy sense of one's own place in the world. Some of the research is interesting but it is often presented so polemically that it becomes hard to follow. And what is the difference between shy and introverted? A distinction that if oft-cited with an air of import but never explained. Too much of this book is like that. It wants to be the bible of introverts, but it falls far short.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Enjoyed this series more than the Twighlight series. However, I had a hard time connecting with the main character sometimes...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! I use it on my Kindle Fire and iPod touch. its great because you can download versions so when you do not have wifi you still have the Bible. it will also read to you as well. I love this app and recommend it to the whole world. and it is FREE!!!

B007V2UGPE|1.0|I'm using a Galaxy Player 5.0 and was enjoying the game until I started paying for Glu points. Half the time, funds were debited from my bank but the Glu points failed to apply in my account. Lost $24 and Glu only offered to reimburse me the least expensive purchase of $2.00. Now I'll have to take it up with my bank. I would have let it go but they failed the customer service test blaming their lack of resources on their 'policy' and acting like their offer of a $2.00 refund was some kind of great favor.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Just started playing but love it already!  I have played games like this nonlinear before and love being able to play from my Kindle Fire!
0345528581|4.0|The workouts are easy to figure out with the descriptions and the pictures.  They are leaving me exhausted and sore in a good way.  These workouts not only build muscle but also build flexibility and balance.<br /><br />The workouts kick butt and are simple to do in a small area.<br /><br />I would caution anyone just starting this book, who isn't already in very good shape, to be careful.  Beginner is very difficult and some of the workouts could cause injuries if you push your out of shape non-flexible body too hard and too fast.  I still don't do the exercises as long as he recommends....even on beginner I can't.<br /><br />Also didn't agree with his take on aerobic exercise.  Ironically his workouts are great to do before a run.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|lots of fun use your brain instead of twitching muscles great graphics..6 slay them evil zombies. highly. recommended for over 13
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is so much fun. Good take on tower defense. The pinball like minigame is a fun addition to the tower defense formula
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|It was really not worth reading. Should have stopped with the first book, second book was bearable however this book felt like a complete afterthought, including the writing, as if it was written by a different author. My Recommendation is to skip this book, you will not miss a thing
0345803485|5.0|Okay, I am not an expert writer, so things like repetitive language don't really bother me.  I know what I like and what entertains me and boy did this book do that!!  I could not put the book down.  I would read when I got home from work, in bed, on breaks, in the car at red lights..... :)  The novel drew me in completely and so did Christian Grey.  Wow....  This is a great read and will surely keep you entertained and smiling :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a great game the first few levels are really easy to get but around level eight its a little harder and more fun!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Very cool game very easy to play. I enjoy it so does my son. All and all a very good game. I like it a lot.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is such a great app.I use it for my daily devotion,there are different plans you can try,and many translations for deeper study. The app lets you make and save notes.You can highlight and bookmark,Trust me it is what you are looking for. It has blessed my life having the word right at my fingertips at all times. I definitely recommend it.
0307456625|5.0|If you bought this book expecting any kind of old-fashioned mystery, then you can just toss it aside right now.  This is not a mystery novel in any traditional sense of the word.<br /><br />Precious Ramotswe has inherited some money from her father's estate and decides to use it to open up a detective agency.  There are no lady detectives in Botswana (her phraseology, not mine), and she decides that she will be the first.<br /><br />What follows is a marvelous exploration of the modern African world with a dash of mystery thrown in.  Mma Ramotswe (how DO you pronounce \\"Mma\\", by the way?) is a size-22 bundle of joy with a very practical and pragmatic view of the world.  She has no illusions about her fellow countrymen but at the same time has an extremely positive outlook on life - an outlook she uses to her advantage to help solve several mysteries, from the amusing to the serious.<br /><br />This is the first book in what promises to be a wonderful series and I will definitely buy the rest of Alexander McCall Smith's books.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I like writing notes during meetings at work. Much faster and easier than typing for impromptu, ad hoc stuff. And sometimes some ideas just flow better when written by hand. So I've checked out tons of styluses. This one is the best. It glides across the glass incredibly smoothly and easily and provides a nice solid resistance (as opposed to the hollow, rubber tipped styluses). But I'm always left wondering if I'd like it even better if it were skinnier like a pencil.
B007IK44CK|5.0|I will admit I an action adventure junkie and this movie DID NOT DISAPPOINT it had it all action, tech, visuals, locations simply awesome glad I got to finally watch it!<br /><br />~Mission Accomplished~ :-)<br /><br />Great casting and Jeremy Renner is HOT

B00782O7IY|5.0|Is this just a coincidence? Martin Scorsese's \\"Hugo\\" is a Hollywood film about a French film pioneer Georges Méliès. A French film \\"The Artist\\" is about a fictional silent movie star George Valentin and the early days of Hollywood. Both films share one theme: great artists forgotten by the world.<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" is a love story. You don't need historical knowledge (though it will help you understand some part of the film). It is a romance between a silent film star George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin) and Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), a big fan of George, whose talent is accidentally \\"discovered\\" by George himself. The year is 1927 when \\"The Jazz Singer\\" was released. The era of silent films is about to end. While adorable Peppy is a star on the rise, George's career declines.<br /><br />The story is very melodramatic, just like old Hollywood movies. Director Michel Hazanavicius believes in the power of visuals and actors' performances (including that of scene-stealing \\"Uggie the dog\\"). Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo shine as the stars of the old-fashioned romantic story. It is a simple story well told.<br /><br />The film's unique supports include James Cromwell, Ken Davitian, John Goodman, Malcolm McDowell, Penelope Ann Miller and Missi Pyle.<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" is a black-and-white \\"silent\\" film, but here \\"silent\\" only means that actors do not speak (mostly). The film has music, but the film's story unfolds with actors' gestures and occasional intertitles (title cards). This is a different cinematic format for storytelling. And it works. Take time and enjoy it.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I was amazed at how ignorant I was to what's been going on in our country for years. I'm embarrassed to say that I hadn't even heard of this investigative documentary and found it by accident, but I've already begun telling people about it.<br />This is something that's going on in our country that's nothing more than greedy corruption, collusion by anyone who will sell their soul to the evil it represents and the epitomy of self serving existentialistist behavior. These people should be dead or in prison for the rest of their lives and yet they're rich, famous and continually placed in positions of authority and power by the politician's running our government.<br />Every TV station in America, especially PBS, should be airing this monthly to remind us as voters that we need to get out and vote and work against this system. If the stock market can't operate unregulated then we need to find some other way to assist the finances of growing business in America. Banks have proven over and over again that people can't be trusted with money, so let's find another way and take the power away from them.
B004EPYZV2|2.0|The movie was awesome, however I have one real big head-scratcher for the Director... Dude, you invested all this time and care into producing some fantastic sequences utilizing the IMAX format, but you chose to leave the cropped theatrical aspect ratio throughout the entire film and depriving the viewers who bought the HD Blu-Ray format of the extra glorious expanded IMAX shots.  What the hell were you thinking there?  I'd call this a technical problem that should be fixed and replaced free to Blu-Ray owners.  Major downgrade in my rating for that to an otherwise cool film.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan at least the right idea for The Dark Knight Blu-Ray release.  What's the point of using the technology if you're not going to show it in all its glory?
B00634GHJA|5.0|I hate emailing my pic to myself! this app has eliminated that. it works quickly too! I am so pleased

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Matt King (George Clooney) lives in paradise but he couldn't be farther from paradise than he is at this moment. He sits in a hospital room where his wife lies in a coma after a horrific boating accident that occurred off of Waikiki Beach. He goes home to care for his 10 year old daughter that he rarely has been with because of his travels and work load. His daughter is an out of control foul mouthed brat who has no respect for anyone. His older 17 year old daughter is in a private boarding school and she is even more ill-tempered and disrespectful.<br /><br />Matt was so involved in his life as a lawyer and the fact that he was the caretaker of the family's trust fund of billions of dollars of pristine land in Hawaii that he rarely had time for his family. Now he is seeing the results of his self-centered life and he is facing the consequences.<br /><br />When he tries to tell his older daughter that her mom is severely injured she tells him that she doesn't care. She has hated her mom since their big fight at Christmas. She tells her dad that she caught her mom cheating on him with another man and that he had no clue what was going on.....<br /><br />This is a tragic story of a dysfunctional family faced with the potential loss of their wife and mother and having no relationship with each other. Matt who wants to blame his wife for having an affair, realizes that if she had been happy then she would not have cheated. If he had been a better father then his daughters would be more respectful and loving.<br /><br />How they cope with the pending loss and with each other is an endearing story of human relationships and failures. The saga is a sad story of lost loves and lost family members and of trying to rebuild a normal life. In the end Matt realizes that no matter what has happened, he loves his wife and his daughters more than ever. Perhaps there is a chance for some happiness after all!<br /><br />We enjoyed this movie and felt that it was very good. It is a good lesson that life is not about money and riches but of the love and the relationships you have with your family and friends. I believe you will like this movie. It is well acted and the storyline is very good.<br /><br />Nothing can touch the following words of Matt to his wife:<br /><br />Goodbye Elizabeth. Goodbye my love. My friend. My pain. My joy. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye!od lesson that life is not about money and riches but of the love and the relationships you have with your family and friends. I believe you will like this movie.

B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I really liked this game and could even get past the energy issue by plying in small bursts and then closing it for awhile while it recharged the energy.  What totally made me crazy was when my timers to get crops I had planted,  food from my animals, or items I made set to crazy tomes like 185 hours. I think I will just uninstall before I invest more time.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Ethan Hunt is in a Russian prison for murder. Meanwhile the Russian nuclear security protocols have more holes in it than Swiss cheese. Agents and terrorists are not only able to steal the Russian launch codes for their missiles they also steal a launch control briefcase to use to get it done. One set of terrorists have the codes and the mastermind evil scientist has the box. They simply have to get together and make a deal.<br /><br />The plan is simple! Break Ethan Hunt out of a high tech maximum security prison and get the codes back. While the IMF team is tasked to retrieve data out of the Kremlin (Of all places) that will help get the codes back, a mastermind terrorist steals the control box and blows up the Kremlin. The IMF team is disallowed as it is believed that they destroyed the Kremlin and the USA is blamed for the disaster. Only the IMF team knows who really did it and that the world is danger of being destroyed by a nuclear war! Ethan Hunt and his team embark on a worldwide hunt to find the villains and stop Armageddon....<br /><br />This movie is non-stop action with a high tech plot that holds your interest. The action and stunt scenes are top notch and many are breathtaking to view. The storyline about the IMF team is thought-provoking as there are mistrusts and hidden secrets that have to be put aside to save the world.<br /><br />This is one of the best high action films of the year and it is acted well and the script is tight and interesting. I recommend this movie to you.

B00634GHJA|2.0|I own 8 computers, 3 servers, 2 Apple iPhone 4's, two iPads, and HP TouchPad, Kindle Fire and a Kindle keyboard. We transfer photos all the time (Almost daily). If I want to send a photo to a device or computer I simply attach it to an email and select the resolution I want to send it in and press a button. On the device I want to put the photo on I just open the email and detach the photo.<br /><br />I don't have to go to the computer and go to the internet and log into a web site to transfer a photo. If I want to transfer a lot of photos then if I have to go to the computer I simply plug in the interface cable.<br /><br />I don't feel comfortable sending photos and such to a website to be returned to me. Photos contain data besides just the photo. A photo from an iPhone or iPad for example can contain the location where the photo is taken, time stamp, altitude, longitude and latitude as well as the precision accuracy of the data. (This can be turned off in the new operating system) In addition some apps can even access your entire photo library without your permission.<br /><br />I would rather transfer photos the simple, faster and safer way than use this app.

0307592731|4.0|There is a vast amount of trail literature, a type of writing that is uniquely American.  I am not aware of any other book in this genre, however, that has received the public acclaim accorded to Wild, Cheryl Strayed's recent memoir of her life on and before her hike along the Pacific Crest Trail.  Wild is one of the top selling books of the year and will become a classic of trail literature in the future.<br /><br />But why is Wild so successful?  It helps, of course, that Strayed is already a critically acclaimed author. A grant from the Oregon Arts commission to write the book certainly improved the text.  Unlike many trail memoirs, this is a polished affair and clearly not composed as an afterthought to the day's work.  But the main reason this book is so successful is the story of redemption it tells.  Strayed's life fell apart when her mother died while she was in her early 20s.  Unable to deal with the grief, she first cheated on then divorced her husband (I was unable to stop feeling bad for Paul throughout the book), took heroin, and went through some gut wrenching events while slowly trying to self destruct.  But when she began to hike, her life began to change.  She forced all her material concerns out of her life, helped in part by two overaged boy scouts who removed many items from her pack, and focused on the immediate activities that allowed her to survive in harsh conditions.  And conditions were tough in 1995.  My wife and I began hiking the trail together that same year and like Strayed, we made the decision to avoid certain sections.  But Strayed perserved and by the end of the trail was a changed, more confident person.  She went on to start writing, got married and had children.<br /><br />People like redemption stories, and this book will remain popular for a long time to come because of how well this one is told.  But I worry that this book's very popularity will prevent people from seeing the bigger picture.  As one prominent long distance hiker noted to me, most hikers are not messed up when they begin a trail, nor fully healed when they end.  But hiking itself, especially for long distances, does profoundly shift one's perspective on life.  Almost everyone who writes about the experience feels the need to say how they are changed by the trail experience, and yet in almost every case, including this one, words do not seem adequate to describe what has happened.  Strayed herself has changed, but after 250 pages of reflection on how miserable her life was before the trail, a few pages on how nice forgiveness (of oneself) and settling down in life after the trail seem almost like magic.  Strayed has substituted listing the differences in her pre and post trail life for explaining them.<br /><br />But it is not magic.  Trail life is a form of modern mystical discipline.  Hikers do not have words to adequately express how their lives are transformed because our society, with its focus on material wealth and abundance, lacks the language necessary to convey the experience.  Nevertheless, mysticism is a common, albeit minority experience in the human condition.  It changes perspective and leads to balance and peace.  Strayed's book details how dramatic the change was to her life, but truly, this sort of experience is available to anyone.  You don't need to divorce your husband, shoot heroin, or try to self destruct first.  All you need to do is lace up your boots and go.ker noted to me, most hikers are not messed up when they begin a trail, nor fully healed when they end.  But hiking itself, especially for long distances, does profoundly shift one's perspective on life.  Almost everyone who writes about the experience feels the need to say how they are changed by the trail experience, and yet in almost every case, including this one, words do not seem adequate to describe what has happened.  Strayed herself has changed, but after 250 pages of reflection on how miserable her life was before the trail, a few pages on how nice forgiveness (of oneself) and settling down in life after the trail seem almost like magic.  Strayed has substituted listing the differences in her pre and post trail life for explaining them.<br /><br />But it is not magic.  Trail life is a form of modern mystical discipline.  Hikers do not have words to adequately express how their lives are transformed because our society, with its focus on material wealth and abundance, lacks the language necessary to convey the experience.  Nevertheless, mysticism is a common, albeit minority experience in the human condition.  It changes perspective and leads to balance and peace.  Strayed's book details how dramatic the change was to her life, but truly, this sort of experience is available to anyone.  You don't need to divorce your husband, shoot heroin, or try to self destruct first.  All you need to do is lace up your boots and go.
0061433047|5.0|I was startled by the negative reviews.<br /><br />This is not a children's book just because the pressures of book promotion impel the publishers to categorize it carelessly.  Pratchett is writing for an older audience than those who enjoyed the adventures of 8-year-old Tiffany Aching.  This is a book about coming of age, and not for little kids, but for young people of around 16.<br /><br />It is about mob mentality.  It is about why ignorance engenders hate.<br /><br />It is about finding unexpected help in time of trouble.<br /><br />It is about how talent can hide in the heads of the most unlikely people.<br /><br />It is about looking at your parents (and parents generally) with new eyes.  Parents are people too, and often very interesting people, and Pratchett was sidling towards this idea without actually stating it aloud.  (After all, who wants to hear this kind of preaching?)<br /><br />It is about how Tiffany might finally find romance, given that the young fellow we all thought might be the nominee seems unlikely to accept the nomination.<br /><br />This is about a world that appears fearful and threatening, but which, in the final analysis, gives you a fair chance.  Pratchett always believed in a world that was even-handed (perhaps something some of us would find unexpected in a determined atheist -- but let that be a lesson to them).<br /><br />Arch

B006KX3GXO|5.0|I got this app, and I frequently use it on deviantART. com. I love it! It has so many unique features!
B005CA4SQK|5.0|The first 2 discs are kind of the same as the 2 disc version i had previously. however; the third disc is loaded with bonus features, and enough to give me even more of a nerdgasm than i had before. love the blu-ray, and love the walking dead.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love this game! Had to remove and reinstall on my Kindle fire Bc at about level 24 the game went buggy and asked for 234 hours to grow crops,  but I didn't mind starting over Bc it's that much fun. It takes a few minutes for energy to regenerate, but I don't really mind Bc it means I get time away from the game to be productive in real life ;)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved these books. Thought it would be geared more to teens but as an adult I thoroughly enjoyed them. Couldn't put them down.
B005CGI4EG|4.0|The set was complete.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  The only thing that I don't like is the way that the discs are housed.  They are split between two spindles.  This makes it kinda hard to get the discs out.  I was expecting them to be separated.  However, since the price was so low for the entire set, I am ok with it.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I cant even get it to run!  i have tried to uninstall and reinstall and nothing yet! HELP!! My son and i were waiting for it to download and then tanrum ensued.... Reinstaled and work!  just have to shut down kindle to turn off....

B005K17RU0|4.0|I've used several weather apps and this one seems the best (so far). It works MUCH better than the one from The Weather Channel. It's simple to set up and use, and it even has a stop button! I'd really like to see THAT in ALL apps!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|welll. the games are pretty fun but you have to earn money to buy more games so its technically not 101 games.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Not very easy to use for us non-weather geeks. Took it off my phone. Accuweather's app is much easier to use. This overloads me with stuff I don't really need. (But it DOES give the weather.)
B005K17RU0|5.0|I had the Weather Channel app before this one and did not like it because it wouldn't reliably update. this app does, and has great graphics for the weather.
B00634GHJA|5.0|This app works just as described. Open it up on your phone and tablet and share photos. So simple! Should work with PC too, I haven't had a chance to try it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's a solitaire game. I use the mobilityware ios app for solitaire on my iPad. Works well on both platforms.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|to those guys who hate this game u suck.  only problem is u cant go to past waves other than that great game.  people should really try this game
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This is a wonderful game with varying degrees of things to do. But there are some major problems that take away from the game.  This is supposed to be a social game yet everytime I try to go to my friend's village, the game says I need to reload the game or that I am not connected to the Internet (which I am). Also, to date, I have across one task that requires 40 acorns to complete. If it is a task, either make it worth fewer acorns or more money, because for that many acorns (which I would have to pay for), I won't waste it on the task. Please fix these problems so the game can be used completely.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a cute game for kids and easy for them to follow. I got it to keep my son busy when at a restaurant and he loved it.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is the musician for the class not for the mass. If you listen to his records or you listen and watch the live concerts, it is just a pleasure.<br />This DVD is a must, and I guess if in Blue ray or standard it doesn't matter, it is just a fine artwork.
B004Y1USJE|5.0|I'm not about to compare this to past favorites. Good bands grow; Yes has grown for sure. One listen and you'll know that Yes is not trying to resurrect their old successes. Why should they? They're in a different place, and a wonderful one at that.<br /><br />The musicianship is strong and polished. Even though I'd like more of the extended instrumental breaks Yes is known for, this stands up as a very strong album. Yes can still surprise me with cool riffs and beautifully complex arrangements. The new singer is a perfect addition as well. Jon Anderson was a uniquely gifted singer, but the new guy's strengths add a freshness to the band's sound that really enliven the band. Anderson and Wakeman will be missed, but not while I'm listening to this recording. I really like this disc a lot.
0345803485|5.0|I personally love these books. The biggest problem is telling myself that Christian Gray is a fictional character, because I can't keep thinking about him. I think this book has opened my mind on things.<br />It is erotic, but also, a love story. One that could never happen in real life. I quickly got through the books, but found that the closer I got to the end of book 3, the feeling of sadness came about.<br /><br />I am going to start reading them all over again. My favorite book ever. Although, this book is not for everyone. I have found my more conservative and reserved friends were turned off by it. But that was not much of a suprise... Good reading!!!!
0374275637|5.0|This offering from Nobel prize-winning author and psychologist Daniel Kahneman adds significantly to the literature on the human mind and reasoning for which he has already prominently figured in and shaped so consistently. As a fellow author who writes about analytical methods and intelligence, I see numerous applications for Kahneman's ideas developed in this book to how analysts and intelligence professionals approach their work. Too much of their work, and more importantly their client's (executives, decision makers, policy officials, etc.)own thinking, are based on fast-thinking (System 1) models when they ought to be based more frequently on slow (System 2) ones. Kahneman's recognition of the two types should be recognized and understood by all individuals making important choices (and don't all of us?) and factored into the work and thinking choices these professionals make on a daily basis. Assuming that people are willing to devote some time thinking about how they're thinking - a critical task that too few individuals devote enough time to in the first place, the insights Kahneman provides are difference making and should lead to better choices across a range of advisory fields within today's most important organizations.
0545265355|5.0|[[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]]<br /><br />Brilliant...did not get much sleep as the books were a once you open them you could not put them down.  Glad I had the entire set as it was great to read from start to finish.
044024630X|4.0|When I bought this book, I didn't read all the comments or hype.  I bought the book because I like the character of Reacher and the way Lee Child portrays him.  I think of Reacher as Lee Child's version of John Sandford's rogue character, Virgil Flowers.  When I read the introduction, I realized we were going to go back to the beginning as to what has made Reacher the man he is.  The only reason I didn't give this novel a 5 star rating was because the characters in the book are a little blurry.  The main action is the fast and absorbing hunt for the serial killer of these \\"amazingly beautiful\\" women near a military base in a small corner of Mississippi.  So much concentration on solution and I would really like a little more depth into the couple who run the hotel, the \\"ugly\\" young man, the mothers of the dead girls, the cousins who are brutally beaten, single-handedly by Reacher.  They are very interesting, could be the main focal point of stories of their own.  Joe, Jack's brother, is a whisper of intrigue that could almost have been eliminated rather than teasing us. That aside, I liked the story and I liked the resolution.  I did not want to put down the book until I finished it.  Bonus: in the paperback there is a short story about Reacher and his family on Okinawa, and it is a terrific read.  The \\"Second Son\\" gets 5 stars for sure!
072325804X|5.0|I became familiar with at least one of these tales when I was a child, but it was not until I had my own child that my mother gave my daughter The Complete Tales, which I eagerly read to her.  We enjoyed it thoroughly and reread our favorites over and over.  There is a lot of variety in these stories of anthropomorphized animals, at times interacting with humans.  They run the gamut from sweet tales to high drama to hilarity.  They're just great to read to children, inspiring their imaginations, touching their hearts, enlarging their vocabularies and their understanding of both the human and animal worlds, and sometimes seamlessly imparting guidance for decent and civil behavior.  In my opinion (and my daughter's, judging by her reaction), \\"The Tale of Two Bad Mice\\" ranks as one of the funniest stories in the English language.  We laughed until we ached!
B004EPYZSK|1.0|Usually my husband picks the movies and he does a good job, but even if this movie has some good actors playing in it....it sucked. I was tempted to stop watching after 20 minute, but I kept watching just to see how bad it was, and it was pretty bad. Do not waste your time, it is so boring...Too many good things to do, than waste your time watching this movie.
B005723JSQ|5.0|What would happen if someone picked up your phone? This story begins with Poppy who is a well-meaning girl who accidentally finds Sam, an high-ranking businessman's phone in a trashcan. They then begin the difficult but hilarious situation of sharing a phone and uncover a devious plot. Of course, there is romance! The story is told through emails and texts in addition to Kinsella's signature writing style. The pages also have numerous footnotes that are quite funny to read. It's a great book and I read through it very quickly because I couldn't put it down!  If you liked her other works, this book does not disappoint :)
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I'm not sure I like these games where you have to purchase credits to continue. It's fun so far but I see an end coming soon because I won't buy the needed credits. Oh well, it was free, and it should be easy to delete.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its cute not too hard or easy. its similar to one i played years ago. love this style game. try it out.
0060936223|5.0|Patti Smith tells about herself and Robert Mapplethorpe in her \\"Just Kids\\" memoir. The book is equally about them both. Their evident photo booth shots are on both covers, heads together on the front cover, kissing on the back cover, with a full side-by-side photo of  themselves in their earliest days chosen for the frontispiece.<br /><br />After Patti, at age 17, leaves her parents' home in Deptford, New Jersey, not far from Cherry Hill here, she heads to the hungry streets of New York City, where luck and circumstance have it that she should meet Robert Mapplethorpe.<br /><br />Patti was always inclined toward books. Robert was not. More and more he developed his photography. \\"Just Kids,\\" in fullness and poignancy, reveals Patti Smith's intelligence and poetic turn of mind. Patti never aspired to a shallow turn-your-head kind of beauty one sees almost daily on any American or European street. Hers is a profound beauty that Robert saw and brought out in his constant photographing of her as they lived together and encouraged one another in the growth of their art.<br /><br />I am glad to have seen several of the photographs, which are included in the book. I loved reading all 300 pages.  Googling for her performances, I found them, like the book, to be haunting, lovely, and strongly moving -- like an orchestra with a full organ, like a hymn. \\"Just Kids\\" is an extended hymn to herself and to Robert. The National Book Award picked a real winner. The book will stay with me for a long time.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Yep, you have the long disfunctional family that includes a former alcoholic father but you also have two brothers who have gone down different paths. The success that the movie ends with goes well beyond any sports victories as the two \\"grown apart\\" brothers are reunited and the viewer is left with the hope that the father will also once again become a part of the family.<br />GREAT fight sequences, great plotline....just one of those \\"get up and pump your fist\\" kind of movies. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, will watch it again and though I rented it from Amazon on Demand initially I will now buy a keeper copy. This is a movie worth watching several times.<br />SUPERB in every way, from the acting to the casting to the action sequences......simply a superb movie that I highly recommend!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|love it good time waster... easy to play, do not like however having to use vitual cash as well as energy to build and purchase some items
B007VGXS8M|1.0|worst game ever do not install its a rip off it bores you to death and its just taking space on hour device!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|At first I honestly didn't think this was going to be a good application, though as soon as I started playing I realized 40 minutes had gone by. haha very fun app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love the fact that it ha multiple versions of the bible. for instance, it has king james,  new american translated,  even has readings for children. great app.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|the fact i purchased it nd it wont install is bad enough nd if you try turing off your device nd re installing it just charges you again what a waste of 6 bucks
B00772M1F6|5.0|Sounds like he did this at Sun Studios with Sam Phillips behind the console yet he still managed to make it sound new.  At least that's how it sounds to me.  I've liked all of them so far.  \\"Country Boy\\", which I think is the single, is extremely good.<br />Have no idea what genre to put it in except the one called \\"Good\\".
0307389839|5.0|I must state that having heard so much about Murakami and of the immense popularity of \\"1Q84\\", I wanted to see what it was all about. Being a triathlete, I decided that this was the book to pick up first.<br /><br />A fast read, it is a memoir of how he first became a runner and his perception on life. He's a bare-bones sort of guy, wants no embellishment and doesn't glamorize anything. He is practical on his outlook on life but has that part that all athletes can relate to: the training. I was intrigued by the fifth and sixth chapters because it became more introspective (the image of the young college students running past him, their strides reflecting their attitude that no one can beat them was especially poignant).<br /><br />As an intro into his world and writing, I found the book a pleasant and welcome addition to my library as well as an inspiration. In the first chapter, the quote \\"pain is inevitable, suffering is optional\\" is something any endurance athlete can relate to. He asks for no pity when he doesn't do as well as he planned and hoped (which was more or less all of the competitions he wrote about) but being Japanese, for as much as he has wandered away from a Japanese style of writing, he is very much of a Japanese heart and therefore, writes in that mindset.<br /><br />I do get the feeling that his other work is a bit different in style because here he adheres to the truth of how his competitions played out, how he felt and how hard he worked to reach that unattained goal. Perhaps I err but I felt that he felt more free because it was that much easier to write; I mean, he was there.<br /><br />All in all, I would read another book of his. He is an honest writer and doesn't care what people think of this memoir. He just wanted to do it for himself and that gets high marks in my book.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book offers a deeply moving account of a man growing up in the horror of a North Korean prison.  The effects of his deprivations and mistreatment extend far beyond the physical, and his struggle with them continues in whatever degree of freedom he can now claim.<br /><br />Not a book for casual reading, but one which might make the world in general a better place, and which certainly sheds light on one of its darkest corners.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game until JUST NOW. I got to level 44 and didn't even mind waiting for my energy to refill. To me that's no big deal. What is a big deal is the game just closed itself and when I restarted it..all my buildings and animals reset to more than 500 hours until ready. What the heck? Please fix this issue because the game was so much fun before this and I would like to keep playing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is fun and challenging and I like playing  with it on my kindle fire.  U will probably like it if I like it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|amazing graphics, soothing music, clever puzzles! this is a perfect mind challenging game to kill time or just to refresh ur mind
B0077ATSSQ|3.0|I just got through watching \\"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close\\". It was an extremely well done movie, that was definitely moving, occasionally funny, and left me with a gut wrenching depression that does not want to go away. I still remember 9/11, vividly, and perhaps I will never be able to watch a movie that brings up the horror of that day as well as this one did!
B0006PV5US|5.0|After I heard the SACD reissue of Charles Munch and the BSO's version of Ravel's \\"Daphins Et Chole\\", I knew I had to get this reissue as well. First of all, the sound quality is great, not just for the era either... Charles Munch has a way of making his recordings of French music sound as though \\"this is the take that matters, this recording will last\\". Another reviewer complained of the \\"Bolero\\" here being performed incorrectly. I cannot comment, I don't really know how to read scores to well yet (I am learning). I am skeptical, because every Bolero seems to have some criticism inflected upon it,,, yet to read a perfectly review interpretation. I love this version though, sounds very fresh and exciting. \\"La Valse\\", \\"Rapsodie Espanole\\", and Debussy's \\"Images for Orchestra\\" are all given outstanding readings here. I have never heard these compositions before and I'm happy they of this caliber.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great great great great game. smart ideas yep. yep. I love my girlfreijd lol I love thexgame tyke passes time quick
B000002J1L|5.0|This is it, the beginning of symphonic progressive rock and what a beginning it was. This 1971 release was unlike anything before it, much more to the rock side than \\"Trespass.\\" The combination of hard rocking guitar,  driving bass and drums, Hammond organ and piano, with awe inspiring vocals: made them the best progressive rock band ever. \\"The Musical Box\\" is what symphonic rock is all about, Steve's guitar and Phil's drums drive this hard rocking story along. This song is as timely in 2012 as it was 40 years ago. Bands like the Flower Kings are still trying to top it. Good luck with that.<br /><br />\\"The Return of The Giant Hogweed\\" is another classic symphonic rock epic and a favorite in concert for many years. The bass line is unbelievably powerful and sets up Peter's vocals perfectly. This is just a great song. \\"Seven Stones\\" features some great Hammond organ by Tony with Peter's always great singing. His voice never sounded better. Phil's work on the drums turns stones from an average rock song to a great one. Say what you want about Phil Collins, he takes a back seat to no one when it comes to playing the drums: He has few peers.<br /><br />\\"Harold The Barrel\\" is a pretty goofy typically english sounding tune. It's the low point of the album but it leads into \\"Harlequin\\" which is a beautiful little number sung by Phil and Peter with Steve on 12 string. The album finishes with the great \\"Fountain of Salmacis.\\" Fountain features a wonderful bass line by Mike and Tony on Hammond. A great end to a great album.<br /><br />This is a 5 star album for its originality, they were the only ones doing it and even they couldn't keep it up. Phil Collins and Steve Hackett were just what Tony, Mike and Peter needed and the rest is progressive rock history. Genesis would continue to top themselves with \\"Foxtrot,\\" \\"Selling England By The Pound,\\" and \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.\\" Each one better than the one before it. The four jewels of progressive rock if you will. Progressive Symphonic Rock: It starts here.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|There's isn't much to say about this DVD collection when it comes to someone who already knows about it or even has the collection themselves, so I'll just explain it to someone who has never even heard about this show, which will be most of the people on here.<br /><br />First off, this show was first aired back on TV in 1997 on MTV, ran for five seasons and two movies (one ending season four and the last ending season five) and went off-air in 2002, just about the same time MTV decided to close down their animation department. This show is basically a spin-off series of another MTV show called \\"Beavis and Butt-Head\\", where our star character, Daria was a supporting role in. After a few seasons of B&B aired, the creator Mike Judge asked one of the writers who basically invented Daria's character (who's name is Glenn Eichler), to created another show staring everyone's favorite cynic.<br /><br />This collection has all of the episodes in fantastic DVD quality with letterbox screen ratio. Only thing it lacks is the nostalgia factor of this show, which is the music during some scene cuts and transitions. This show, back when it was still on TV, had its moments where it'll play songs that were popular back in the mid to late 90s, from 311 and The Offspring to Korn and Rammstein. There is a little note where the creator, Glenn talked about why the music is not in the DVD release of this show and I (and hopefully everyone else) understand why they had to cut out the music bits and why it's been replaced with generic music cues. Costs for licensing would of been a fortune, making this DVD release impossible to achieve. The only exception is the original theme song, played by the all-female rock group, Splendora, that plays during the beginning of each episode.<br /><br />When this show was still on TV, I was only about 6 years old and only saw bits a pieces of it when my eldest brother watched it. It didn't really click with me since I was too young to understand its message, so I skipped out on it. Boy, did I really miss out. This is basically a show about a very intelligent and cynical girl that's just trying to make it through High School without any social interaction, but life's never fair for anyone, including Daria. It seems in almost every episode, she's usually forced to do something she's not proud to do, makes her seem hypocritical, or just stick out, which is something she doesn't like to do. For the message it displays, all this show is tell us is no matter what era you're from, High School will always be the same for everyone; nothing will be different. You have all of your typical groups: the jocks, the nerds, the geeks, then you have Daria (along with her only true friend Jane).<br /><br />This is a great show and I would highly suggest it to anyone who would like to watch something mellow, but still have a laugh. One thing I should warn is that the humor placed in this facade of a cartoon is quite dry. It's that type of comedy that's only funny when you think about what the punchline was about.
0062060562|4.0|this book gives a gripping look into the life of an amnesiac...a very realistic story and you actually feel the emotions of the main character

B000002MUW|4.0|This was Madonna's, follow up to Erotica. I feel that Erotica is a classic, Bedtime story, however does not meet Eroticas greatness.<br />  Still the cd, is worth the buy. Survival, Don't Stop, Sanctuary, are among my favorites.<br /><br />  The singles, Secret,and Take a bow, were overplayed. Still they are good.<br />  I prefer the singles Human Nature, and Bedtime story.<br />  Bedtime Story, is awesome, because it is so different.<br />  The song Inside of me, is a song about Madonna's mother, who died when Madonna was only 7. I love it, because it reminds me of my father who died.

B0059XTUVI|1.0|This movie gravely disrespected one of history's greatest leaders and pioneering women of modern times - Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  A women who understood how stand up for solid moral values.  Understood what honor is, to do the right thing whether or not it was popular or it might cost you.  Ultimately, this was a ridiculous political farce trying to demean value and character based living and leadership by portraying it as an old, drunken, and insane thing of the past.  In this time, and especially in our country, the need for leadership based in good character, integrity, the courage to fight for the \\"general welfare\\" and not for what is just good for me, and to be willing to be unpopular for the sake of truth is paramount.  This was a pitiful attempt to discredit this desperately needed philosophical position of leadership.  Shame on Streep for this defaming portrayal of a historical figure who should  be lauded and emulated.
B001CZVVV4|2.0|I have over 100 opera and ballet DVD/BR's that I watch on a projected screen about 7' 8\\" wide and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the left and right speakers are about 9' 6\\" apart. The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows.<br />I have watched this I Puritani a few times now and while this BR receives high praise here (7 times 5 Stars as of today), the DVD reviewers of the same performance are a lot more critical.<br />While the picture is fine, the audio is certainly not 5 stars.<br />Although I do see a black clip in one scene in Cutler's hair, that could be part of a body microphone, the sound does not reflect that recording technique. I see no wires/mics. on Netrebko or any other singers. I see a few stage microphones aiming low, probably to record the staircase scenes in act II to the best of their abilities. However, they seemed aimed too low for the principals up front.<br />To me it sounds like a recording with poorly placed stage microphones only and while the chorus in the back sounds fine, the principals are often too far away from the microphones and sound under-recorded.<br />At my normal listening level, the soundstage in the surround track barely exceeds the front corner speakers and gives you the impression of sitting in row 15 rather than my preferred row 4. As far as the principal voices are concerned, they often sound even further away.<br />Playing it at louder levels widens the soundstage and the singers \\"come closer\\", however now you hear all the background noise of shuffling feet and every page that gets turned in the orchestra. And the singers still don't sound clear.<br />Applause is also from the front only, barely incorporating the surrounds.<br />So while Netrebko and to a degree Relyea are still worth watching, the overall audio experience is below average with Cutler sounding strained at the higher notes and Vassallo and Valdes sounding weak and muffled.<br />Overall not recommended.<br />The Decca performance with Florez/Machaidze (on 2 dvds) is much better recorded and beats this hands down audio-wise (see my separate review for details).
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love the game!! It didnt &quot;trap&quot; me by keeping me from leaving the game because I knew how to get out of the game.
B004097IKW|5.0|I have over 100 opera and ballet DVD/BR's that I watch on a projected screen about 7' 8&#34; wide and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the left and right speakers are about 9' 6&#34; apart. The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows. It's a DVD, so the picture in the longer shots is not that sharp, but the closer shots are o.k. It comes on 2 DVDs, so Decca did not squeeze it on one disc only. Audio (DTS 5.1) is excellent. The orchestra is very well recorded with a soundstage reaching 2/3 towards the surrounds. This also gives the impression of the orchestra pit up front with a deep stage like La Gazzetta. Off-stage chorus is out of the left surround. The singers sound much better than in the Met performance due to well hidden body mics, although they come mostly through the center. Sometimes the orchestra is a tad too loud relative to the voices, but overall this wins hands down over the Met production audio-wise. Whatever Netrebko might have over Machaidze (and it is not that much in my view) is far outweighed by the better recording technique. Florez skips the Palermo F, but sounds flawless otherwise. All other principals are also a lot better sounding than in the Met's performance. As for the performance itself, it is more static than the Met's with mostly &#34;stand and deliver&#34; and little action. Lighting seems to also show that Italy needs to spend less. But it is complete and about 25 min. longer than the Met's cut version. I gladly give up picture quality in exchange for much better sound.  Edit: On my Dvd there is a step-up in loudness at 47 minutes into the performance by about 2 db, so I play this with -10 db at the beginning, then lower it to -12 db when I hear the step-up. It's in the duet of Arturo's entrance scene.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Keeping this brief.<br /><br />Had the commonly reported issue with timers resetting to unrealistic times, like 150 hours.  This obviously prevents users from playing daily.

B005GHN2GG|4.0|I have to admit, it was the new edition's cover that tipped the balance and made me buy this book. Of course all the raving reviews didn't hurt, either.<br /><br />And...it was $2.99 well spent.<br /><br />Okay, at first when the book opens and we meet Silhara in Neith and the god Corruption is trying to possess him, I almost stopped reading because of the overly dramatic prose.<br /><br />I stuck with it and I was glad I did. So yes, there are some disconnected bits of dialogue I didn't follow, and the build up to the confrontation with Corruption is much, much more dramatic than the actual confrontation itself, and Martise makes a huge deal out of hiding the fact that she's a slave even after her and Silhara's relationship made that particular piece of information meaningless...but these are all minor annoyances.<br /><br />Silhara is all dark and uber-broody and self-sacrificial and sharpens his wit on everyone he cares about. (For goodness sake, his most prized posession is a grove of orange trees despite the significance oranges have for him- talk about masochistic)and is so, so much fun to read.<br /><br />Even when they are harvesting oranges (and avoiding Crow poop) Martise and Silhara are a majorly moony couple.<br /><br />Along for the ride is a loyal, mute servant, a corrupt priest-lord to hate, and the culmination of the mystery of Martise's gift that sets up the perfect (if predictable) dilemma. In other words, nothing new in trope-ville, but a comfortable plunge into fantasy with a romantic, broody hero of the highest order.<br /><br />This Book's Snack Rating: Black bean tortilla chips for the dark, dark taste of Silhara with a satisfying, salty flavor of a substantial romance.
B0073U2FB2|3.0|Four Americans, in Moscow for different reasons, are caught up in a desperate fight for survival when a massive alien invasion occurs. As one after another character vaporizes, the survivors search for refuge, and a means to fight back. You couldn't say that there is a high body count here, because the aliens vaporize every living thing, leaving only a few ashes.<br /><br />The characters are marginally believable, but the action is not very realistic, and the suspense is mostly about who is going to get toasted next. Although the aliens seem hopelessly high tech, impervious to firepower, equipped with wonderful sensors, they seem unable to hear our heroes talking, unable to react as a group, or come to the aid of other aliens.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting reality, but I was hoping to get into the story, to be caught up in the action. Movies like Independence Day, or War of the Worlds were equally preposterous, but they had enough realism to fire my imagination, and I was completely enthralled by them. The Darkest Hour failed in that respect. It was ok, mildly entertaining, but essentially a disappointment.
0525423281|5.0|The thing about this book is that the characters are flawed, and I loved them anyway.<br /><br />Cricket and Calliope Bell move back next door to Lola one summer and bring with them embarassing memories and upheaval.<br /><br />I loved that Lola had two gay parents (one of whom who baked pies) in a pastel-colored house in the Castro District of San Francisco. I loved that her weird costumes made me uncomfortable and fear for her sanity, and wonder if she knew who the real Lola was.<br /><br />I loved that her boyfriend Max was willing to put up with overly protective gay parent brunches every Sunday and may-or-may not have had a Lolita complex.<br /><br />I loved the fact that her birth-mother was a druggie and embarrassed her and read tea leaves for a living.<br /><br />And I loved Cricket. Shy, unconfident, well-meaning, awkward and earnest Cricket who blurts things out and always, always puts the best spin on others' behaviors.<br /><br />And yes, I found Lola extremely frustrating, but I never came out of her corner. Even when it's clear she's with the wrong guy and taking advantage of Cricket's feelings and showing up late for work and walking out on her parents in a fit of pique with her older boyfriend, I was still rooting for her.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the moments with Anna and St Clair (from her first book, Anna and the French Kiss) talk about squee. When St. Clair gives Lola advice about how it feels to be with the wrong person I just about swooned.<br /><br />So despite being irritated with Lola's self-centeredness, and shocked at how a hurt Max can act so angrily, and frustrated by Cricket continually putting others first, I really, really enjoyed the banter, the crazy families, the pies, the ice-skating, the costumes, and the San Francisco setting.<br /><br />And every once in a while, the author would hit you with a moment like Lola standing in the driveway watching Cricket drive away from her and Cricket's baby niece squealing in awe as a flock of wild parrots takes flight across the grey sky and is overwhelmed by color and noise. Or the note on Cricket's window has a crayon rubbing of \\"Dolores\\" (Lola's real name\\" from the actual Dolores Park sign on it.<br /><br />Beautiful.<br /><br />This Book's Snack Rating: Like eating chocolate-covered potato chips for the creamy-sweetness of the YA romance with the salty, crunchy fun of these crazy characters.as a flock of wild parrots takes flight across the grey sky and is overwhelmed by color and noise.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I don't know how this book got past copyright.  It is obviously a Twilight fanfic and probably should have remained as such.  There is even an x-rated \\"hitching\\" scene.  (You Twihards know what I'm talking about).  Case in point:<br /><br />Twilight:<br />\\"You really shouldn't do that to people,\\" I criticized. \\"It's hardly fair.\\"<br />\\"Do what?\\"<br />\\"Dazzle them like that -- she's probably hyperventilating in the kitchen right now.\\"<br />He seemed confused.<br />\\"Oh, come on,\\" I said dubiously. \\"You have to know the effect you have on people.\\"<br />He tilted his head to one side, and his eyes were curious. \\"I dazzle people?\\"<br />\\"You haven't noticed? Do you think everybody gets their way so easily?\\"<br />He ignored my questions. \\"Do I dazzle you ?\\"<br />\\"Frequently,\\" I admitted.<br /><br />Fifty Shades:<br />\\"You know, it's really not fair.\\"  I glance down at the Formica tabletop, tracing a pattern on it with my index finger, trying to sound nonchalant.<br />\\"What's not fair?\\"<br />\\"How you disarm people.  Women.  Me.\\"<br />\\"Do I disarm you?\\"<br />I snort.  \\"All the time.\\"<br /><br />Anastasia meets Christian Grey.  He is a dominating CEO and she is a submissive college student.  He is incredibly rich and devastatingly handsome and he will not allow people to touch him.  Ana is determined to find out why and break his shell.<br /><br />There are sex scenes aplenty in the book.  Truthfully, I know very little about Doms & Subs.  And I'd wager that the author has very little practical experience, either.  All sorts of kinky things are happening, but she refuses to use descriptive words for the character's genitalia.  \\"He touched me there.\\"  \\"His palm cupped my sex.\\"  I can imagine Anastasia's inner goddess rolling her eyes at the tame descriptions of such erotic acts.

B007UXSPK2|2.0|I will try not to spoil any ones boring time watching this movie. I watched this thing called a movie and it was such a big let down. After all the great action and suspense in the last MI movie and the great reviews I heard and the money it made I just knew this was a sure hit. Even the title is very cool. But what I watched lacked a reasonable plot had zero suspense. The action was not even that great and the bad guy came off as some crazy fool who's ideas made little sense and was not explained at all.<br /><br />The actors were just as poor the girl on the team should have kept her part on Law and Order SVU. I hope they never let her do another MI movie. And I hope the other guy that was an agent does a btter job brining something to the Bourne and Avengers movies he will be in. And please the comic was just not needed. The gagets well let's look at the famous \\"car\\" Tom said \\"wait until you see the car\\". Well we saw that car for all of 3 to 4 min and it looked nice but hey what was so cool about it?<br /><br />I do agree with another reviewer that special features on the DVD were also very weak. For me the best MI was number 3 with this being the bottom one. Many die hard MI fans hate the first one for what they did to Mr. Phelps. I am glad the director for the next one will not be the same. I hope they can put together a good story that has all the needed things 1)Action 2)believeable plot 3)Cool Bad guy 4)Suspense 5)cool gagets that work.

0345525558|5.0|This is a complex, and very good novel about people who have been hurt, and have hurt others yet keep trying to find a way to establish lasting relationships.  Victoria, a graduate of the foster system,  is so involuted because of years of neglect and non-caring custodians that she can only express herself through the language of flowers.  Like many who have been hurt so many times,  she manages to sabotage any chance of developing lasting relationships.  Her last chance seems to be a chance encounter with a person she met briefly while she was under the care of another emotionally damaged woman.<br />This book is a good study of the loving yet imperfect relationships of mothers,  daughters and sisters.<br /> The one complaint I had about the plot is that I could never believe that an abandoned infant would not have been placed with a couple who would have loved Victoria and adopted her as a baby.  The novel skipped over her pre-school years and  jumped to the part where Victoria has developed a very hard inpenetratable shell of self-defensive aggression towards everyone.<br /> I did like this novel very much,  Victoria is a fascinating character.

The last 1/4, trying to be a hipster in the future, I think, the book fell flat on my ears.<br /><br />Here's the thing.

0345803485|5.0|At first I thought this book was a little weird and disturbing but as I kept reading it I couldn't put it down. It becomes so much more then a dominant/submissiveness relationship. They change eachother and help eachother through their personal issues. There's a reason Christian is the way he is and hes willing to change for Anastasia. Its a wonderful, sexy and exciting love story. I've read the first two and cant wait to read the last book. Hoping the author does more books because these two characters are adicting.

Since the reader knows things that are not yet in evidence, you feel like you are there sitting on the edge of your seat wondering if and when...The psychological stories of the family and the effect all this has on them is just riveting and you feel like you know these people. But, do you want to? And the crimes, oh the crimes! WOW! I can't say much more without giving it away. There is so much here. If you enjoy crime dramas, courtroom dramas, psychological thrillers-this is the book for you! I had so many AHA and OH NO moments reading this.

0439023491|2.0|I won't rehash what others giving this book a poor review wrote. I do agree with most of the comments. The author has really failed to continue her compelling story with the same awesome writing as the first book, The Hunger Games. There is absolutely no character development, just a rehashing. I think she actually ran out of ideas, hence the introduction of the games again. She could have done a much better storyline rather than throwing the two main characters back into the ring. I was very disappointed in this author's talents to continue her story. I actually wonder if Collins even wrote Catching Fire. Doesn't read like the same writer. Or, maybe she just cranked it out fast with little thought in order to go on to the next book. Kinda like what James Patterson has done over the last several years?

5551369242|5.0|In newer editions of this collection, King's first Bachman Book, Rage, is omitted. Stephen King took it out of print because of its similarity to the Columbine tragedy and the fact that at least one of the shooters cited it as an \\"influence\\". I understand King's reluctance to keep the story in print, but I also believe everyone is responsible for their own actions, and that we can't blame art for the decisions people make. For that reason, even though it's not as easy to find and may cost a little more, I recommend finding a copy of the original that has Rage as well as the other three novels. Now, enough with the editorial. Here are a few notes on each story.<br /><br />Rage--A brutally honest, if somewhat naive, look at what makes teenagers tick. In public schools, a single classroom holds such a complex mixture of personalities, moods, and motivations, that it's a wonder schools are functional at all. I find it interesting, though, that in today's society, the extreme insecurities and pressures the students in Rage operate under might be better suited to middle school than high school. Nonetheless, the senseless shootings stemming from social alienation proved prophetic, and the warning should not be ignored.<br /><br />The Long Walk--King predicts that our increasing bloodlust in entertainment will lead to a show where an audience watches a group of young men from poor families try to outwalk one another. Everyone dies but the winner, who earns fame and fortune. Needless to say, this is a bleak novel with a pessimistic view of humanity.<br /><br />Roadwork--I think this is the oddball of the group. The protagonist is a man adrift, a middle-aged laundry worker who has to give up the house and workplace he cherishes so a new highway extension can be built right through them. He falls into a deep depression, lies to his wife and bosses, and basically self-destructs. After some alarming personal adventures, he decides to take his fate into his own hands. In some ways, his journey reminds me of John Smith from The Dead Zone.<br /><br />The Running Man--Again, King looks into his crystal ball, and this time sees a future game show in which convicted violent criminals run from armed stalkers with, once again, fame and fortune as the prize for survival. It's quite a bit different from the Arnold Schwarzenegger film that was based on it; it's much more dark and gritty. Given the way it ends, I'm almost surprised King didn't pull it out of print along with Rage after another certain national tragedy, but I guess the circumstances were different enough not to merit doing that.<br /><br />These four novels have nothing whatsoever to do with the supernatural, as King was using his pseudonym early on as a vehicle to write and publish fiction outside of the expectations he had created under his own name. Surprisingly, despite his other novels having monsters, ghosts, and demons, these stories have less mainstream appeal and seem more like a young author trying to be literary. And achieving it, in my opinion. All four of these books are dead serious, and delve deeply into their characters' psychological underpinnings. Before he died from \\"cancer of the pseudonym,\\" as King calls it, Bachman did branch out into King territory with his next and last book, Thinner, but the early ones are in their own category. For a different take on Stephen King's writing talents, and maybe an appreciation for his diversity and ambition as an author, give The Bachman Books a read.s, his journey reminds me of John Smith from The Dead Zone.<br /><br />The Running Man--Again, King looks into his crystal ball, and this time sees a future game show in which convicted violent criminals run from armed stalkers with, once again, fame and fortune as the prize for survival.

0439023513|2.0|The conclusion of the Hunger Games trilogy had much to live up to. The first novel, a book which deserves all of the attention and much of the praise which it has received, delivers a breathtaking and tragic world for the remainder of the series to fill. Its characters, plot points, and themes are well-established and thoroughly explored in the first book.<br /><br />The second novel kept up the quick pace and surreal division between the elite and the impoverished which had characterized the first. It revitalized and cashed in on the intellectual property in intriguing ways. The story further explores the internal dynamics of major character relationships, and forces the reader into uneasy alliances that ultimately reward. But in my opinion, it is in the ending chapter of Catching Fire where the series began to unravel.<br /><br />Where we had before a strong, driven protagonist throughout the first and majority of the second novel in Katniss, by the end of Catching Fire our lens into the nation of Panem has begun to morph into a simpering, self-consumed girl. Her angst strays from relationships to how those relationships define her, but in unsurprising and largely uninteresting ways.<br /><br />So it is with disappointment that I state that the third novel feels like only so much more navelgazing interspersed with often contrived plot points. Still, I felt the urge to read on. It wasn't until the final chapters that my disappointment with the tone developed into a simple failure of disbelief when, in the events leading up to the final conflict, the book forces a character into an inexcusably poor death. That death feels like it was contrived simply to drive home a hamfisted message about our current world, but the message falls flat on its face simply because I'm left with more questions than answers about the death which is supposed to establish this externalization.<br /><br />****SPOILERS: DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE MYSTERY INTACT****<br />Prim dies. And she dies ingloriously. She dies because she's forced onto the front lines as a medic to help Capitol kids who, apparently, the Rebels bombed. A second set of bombs, delayed to go off to kill the aid who comes to help the survivors of the initial explosions, wipe out a Prim who should not be in the Capitol. Her presence is never really explained, but waved away by narrative magic. It's insulting, and it doesn't make sense. My frustration isn't that Prim dies; it's that she dies in so utterly contrived a way.<br /><br />It's not that her death is meaningless; if Prim had died in a random attack, I would have been infuriated but struck by the notion that nobody's a superhero and the people we imagine we would fight to save might die simply \\"because.\\" No, it's not that Prim's death is meaningless - it's the opposite. It's overzealously portrayed as metaphorical and meaningful. Prim dies in a forced juxtaposition to the opening scenes of the series, to underscore the author's moral. It underwhelms and steals so much energy from a novel already enervated by a moping protagonist. It sucks. I don't know how else to say it. I want to say it at least sets up some great narrative denouement, but the realization that it sucks to live in a world where we use children as pawns isn't all that surprising.<br /><br />You may still enjoy the book. And if I were you, I'd read it anyway simply because I DEVOURED the first two novels and would STILL need to know what happened. I give Collins that: her world was so impressive that I simply had to see it resolved. But in the eleventh hour, the author made a terminal mistake: she sacrificed a character for the sake of a moral. It reads like bad sentimentalism, and the fact that our protagonist has been moping around and paying attention to other characters only insofar as they directly affected her certainly doesn't help.
B003U00EBC|4.0|This was briefly put out with the anaglyth red and green glasses type of 3d. That system was the only type available when this was put out on blu ray. Today you can get a proper 3d version that is actually cheapet to buy than this one is.  I would make sure to ask which version you are getting. The newer 3d version needs a 3d tv and 3d player and it looks outstanding. The older version which uses the old style glasses is ok but it can't compare. In fact using the red and green glasses causes a ghosting effect, (images seems to have lines around them or a fainter second image) this is ccmmon and normal when using those old style glasses. SO you don't want to pay 35.00 for that version, while the version with the 3d logo on it looks great as you will have the black glasses and a three d tv.  The story isn't as good as the 1959 version which is coming out on blu ray in 2012, but it's fun and a romp with effects from the 00's decade so that's a bonus.  It's got extras too. But I would certainly not waste your money on a older 3d version with green and red glasses unless you don't ever intend buying a 3d tv. That would be a mistake though as the format is outstanding. SO make sure to ask which version you are getting. The older is more exp3ensive because it was in print only a few months and lots of people complained abou tit and it was yanked out of print.  The ghosting though is what you get with those glasses on a tv. that's just the way it was until the new format came out and you can get this in the new format for less!.
B004EPYZV2|3.0|I think there are several reviews already with the same complaints but I just thought I would add my voice to the chorus.<br /><br />No spoilers.<br /><br />The Movie- 5 Stars<br />This movie has a ton of \\"hands-down\\" moments. Among them:<br />- Probably one of the best pure action movies I have ever seen. Yes, the plot is silly, but this is not a movie you walk into expecting it to change your perspective on life. It's just a fun and exciting movie which puts a very nice spin on the tired franchise with the Murphy's Law conundrums. Part of the fun is watching how Tom Cruise and team find their way around everything that the plot throws at them. One of my favorite sequences in MI3 was the Italy scenes where a daring heist is carried off flawlessly. In this movie, you have tons of heist scenes where absolutely nothing goes right and the movie still manages to find that tricky signature balance between action/plausibility/humor that carries the viewer from scene to scene with bated breath.<br /><br />- Direction/editing was first-rate. Brad Bird really has the chops to carry this off and I look forward to his next big screen popcorn pleaser.<br /><br />- Acting. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY runs like Tom Cruise. Despite his tarnished public image, Cruise proves once again why he is the king of action movies. His intensity and star mega power is on full display here and his physical investment is right up there on the screen. He is nicely matched with the supporting cast---Paula Patton is the feminine charm (and how nice it is to see an actress who is not a 20 year old stick and is believable being super sexy and kicking butt!), Simon Pegg is used in just the right amounts and Jeremy Renner is adequate in his role as well, though I am not sure if he can match Cruise on pure charisma if the plan is to have him take over the series someday. He does have amazing arm veins though.<br /><br />- The Imax scenes in the theatre were jaw-dropping and perfectly blended into the regular scenes. And this leads me to my complaints.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray Disc- 3 stars<br />I cannot emphasize how incredibly disappointed I was that these Imax scenes were not presented in the disc.<br /><br />I have no idea why they skimped out on this, but those panoramic sweeping vista moments were a key highlight to this movie. The opening scenes in Prague set the stage, the Dubai scenes contributed to that sense of vertigo and epic stomach churning anxiety. Why would they not include these on the Blu Ray?<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" Blu Ray, still my favorite disc, proved you can do this well for the home audience. When I ordered MI4, I was most looking forward to seeing those Imax scenes again and was extremely disappointed they were not included. And yes, that was enough to dock 2 stars for me, despite the movie's excellence.<br /><br />Do I regret this purchase? Yeah, I kinda do. I am super picky with my Blu Ray purchases because I went a little nuts purchasing 100's of DVD's and promised myself only to buy Blu Rays which were superlative. I was really hoping this would be one of them and I feel a bit cheated because in my opinion, this was not the whole movie. Those Imax scenes were a labor of love to shoot and specifically part of Brad Bird's vision and it is a huge disservice to have not included them.<br /><br />ETA: I actually did a little research as to why Brad Bird did not include the 16:9 aspect ratio to accommodate the Imax scenes...apparently, this was so that there would be no impact on people who have constant height projection systems. Again, this was Mr. Bird's choice and I guess I have to respect it.<br />One more thing I did want to add which I did not mention in my review---the Blu Ray itself *is* pretty incredible in both picture and sound. Really great quality. My only nitpick was the exclusion of 16:9 aspect Imax scenes, which even though there is now a real reason for it, I wish were still included as an extra.
0345803485|1.0|I'm puzzled by how this book became such a huge hit. It's the fast food of literature - cheap, bloated and easy. The only difference is fast food tastes good. Don't try eating the book. I tried and it left me with indigestion. I figured if I didn't like the book that I'd may as well improve my fiber intake. Bad idea.<br /><br />This tome of flotsam floated into my consciousness at the urging of a friend. I don't normally read books like this, but she was enrapt, completely thrilled by it. Since I'm a big reader and wanted to see what the fuss was about, I gave it a go. And if I didn't like it, well it's good intestinal ruffage for me.<br /><br />The story I read followed this basic pattern and dialogue, all involving the overused word \\"crap\\" and it's conjugations:<br /><br />\\"He's looking at me. Crap. I'm looking at him. Double crap. He cocked his head (also overused) to the side. Triple crap. Oh my, his eyes are so grey (this is repeated about 670,983 times). Quadrupled crappity crapping crap playing craps while crapping on the crappy crapping crapper.\\"<br /><br />The main protagonist, Anastasia Steele, likes to say \\"crap\\" a lot. It made me have to go to the bathroom. And I ATE this book?<br /><br />I wonder again what makes everyone praise this thing and why it is such a hit. It's incredibly pedestrian, sophomoric and trite. Why does this sell? I feel like the truly good books are small and sparse pines on a mountain face and all of the popular ones of today are avalanches that consume them. The good ones get flushed away by the wuthering of the mediocrity monster.<br /><br />I found myself furrowing my brow in confusion while reading it. Where is the brilliance? What is so enchanting about it? Why, why, why was this such a big hit? I tried in vain to find something magical or even mildly interesting about the contents and characters, but found I had more fun playing the drinking game whenever the main character gasped about Grey's grey eyes. I need a new liver. Thanks.<br /><br />Of course, I could just be a snob and much too uncompromising, having read Jane Eyre and several other classics shortly before I picked up this cannon fodder... AHHH, I mean BOOK. So I may be a snob. Caviar and crumpets, Jeeves... yes, do bring some, won't you? Thank you, dearest.<br /><br />But I doubt I'm a snob. I just don't like fast food literature. Don't be confused - the book itself isn't fast food (doesn't taste like it, anyway). I'm just saying the contents are for the masses who like dumb, easy reading.<br /><br />If you want to read literature that is the equivalent of the overpriced, frou frou sounding dishes at restaurants for the rich, find a classics list online. Read them. They are classics for a reason. And you won't even have to leave a gratuity.<br /><br />This review is long enough. Crap. It's getting late. Double crap. I have to go. Triple crap!<br /><br />Bathroom here I come.

B00634GHJA|1.0|This app constantly forces closes. I never even got it to load the first time. I read nothing in the description about my device not being compatible. Thankfully I got this on a free app because had I paid for this, I would have been upset. Do not download this app!
B0014BY72Q|5.0|The movie is dated in terms of special effects but remember it was made in 1976. I was 11 years old at that time. Farrah Fawcett also was very popular because of Charlie's Angels. It was a big deal to see her in this movie. I hadn't seen this in probably 25-30 years and was pleasantly surprised it was on the free Amazon Prime videos. I enjoyed it even though I knew what was going to happen. The movie left an impression on me as an adolescent and I think definitely worth watching again. I don't know if those born after 1980 would even relate to it or be able to finish it but it brought back memories. Definitely it was a sign of the 1960s and 1970s, the emphasis on youth but also trying to \\"change the world\\" and fight injustice that the lead characters are actually able to do.
B0039PPW60|3.0|I like this unit, for low end mixing and to add some body to the process, I use a Samson CO3 CM its a great little rig for pod casting and doing calls, its definitely on the limited side but that just the way USB is, if you need to do some average mixing, its a great choice.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|the best ever yeah I don't know what do with out<br />that game.the saints yeah everybody should this game.<br />best
B00634GHJA|2.0|Force closes every time I open the app.  Running EnergyROM by the way. Any ICS compatible apps have always worked just fine.<br /><br />I give it 2 stars though just because I like the concept of file transfer between computers/devices without having to get help from a \\"cloud\\".  Usually I give apps that FC on me just 1 star.<br /><br />But from reading the reviews it seems this app provides a URL for another comptuer/device to use to download the pics/videos from the device.  I guess that overcomes any need to have the app on the other device or a PC client app in order to do file transfers.<br /><br />My personal favorite for file transfers via WiFi is X-Link, you can find it on the Android Market.  X-Link is always free.  You need to have the app on 2 devices, or the app on the device and a client PC program in order to do transfers, but its fast and easier than typing URLs.  The client PC program is a free Java program.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|Saw this book at Costco and bought it on the spot for my Kindle.  Didn't bother to read the reviews knowing there would be a lot of whining about the price.  Didn't care.  Baldacci is my favorite author.  Loved the book and could only put it down to sleep (finished it in two long sittings).  Enjoyed the characters and the pace, could figure some of the \\"players\\" and caught hints of what might come down but was thoroughly entertained through to the conclusion (I was considering many possibilities of how this would conclude and who the bad guys could be but actually didn't figure it all out - this is a good thing).  Great read and would recommend this book.  Is the movie being filmed yet?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent app. I use it for quick comparisons of translations. It's on my Kindle Fire and works perfectly.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|This Movie is really interesting the way it was put together, I prefer this edition to the others because it goes into more depth, makes you think about the world of intelligence and how it can change in an instant, over all its a great edition to your collection.

0307592731|5.0|This is an exceptional memoir written by a woman who had embarked on a grand adventure traversing the Pacific Crest Trail alone almost 17 years earlier.  Although she provides a vivid and descriptive account of her often-hellish experience, it is the back story that illuminates her writing - her attempt to finally come to terms with her mother's death 5 years before and exorcise the pain of that loss through sheer physical (and mental) endurance during her 3 months alone on the trail.  Along the way she faces the demons that have haunted her during those years.  Strayed's writing is phenomenal, exposing a brutal honesty about her willingness to unearth the truth about herself and the often disfunctional behaviors she had engaged in to avoid her grief before the trek.  Highly recommended.

B0000CABBW|5.0|I found this movie to be quite stunning, not only visually, but emotionally, as well.  It was quite touching and moving, and I found myself very much connected to the lead actress, Pai.  Learning about indigenous cultures and their struggles to maintain their traditions and morals in an ever-changing modern world really helped me to see the depth of this film.  For me, the inner turmoil of the Maori tribe that is depicted on screen is the result of them trying to hold on tightly to the foundation that their ancestors built.  I think there is meant to be a subdued understanding that modern ways-of-life are gradually taking hold of their own private society.  The only things you see in the film to suggest this is the music blaring from a stereo and the graphics on the clothes of the children.  Basically, this is telling us that there is a world outside of the Maori civilization that is threatening to take over if they are not able to fight it off.<br /><br />The young actress, Keshia Castle-Hughes, gave an Oscar-worthy performance as Pai, a young Maori girl whose mother and twin brother died during birth, and whose father left her with her grandparents so that he could venture out on business.  Pai's grandfather, Koro, is very resentful of the fact that there is no male heir to take his place as leader of his Maori community.  To remedy the situation, he starts a school to teach the young boys of the community the ways of the Maori.  Pai tries to take part in the education, but is harshly refused because she is a girl.  Pai never gives up the fight for equality, and is encouraged by her loving grandmother.  Although her grandfather also loves her very much, he is unable to see past her gender to see that she does, indeed, possess the perfect leadership qualities he has been searching for.<br /><br />I watched this movie as an assignment for class, but I am taking much more away from it than that.  It really opened my eyes to the differences between my modern world andthe modern world of indigenous tribes.  I give this film two big thumbs up and I recommend it to everyone.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I love this app it keeps all my docs in order makes it easy to return paperwork its just an overall great application

0307949486|2.0|A quick read of the first chapter and the generally rave reviews proved to be enough to goad me into picking up The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo with the serious intent of joining that illustrious and ever expanding club boasting of its literary greatness.  Admittedly, all the ingredients of a great story and page-turning experience were there: a disgraced journalist offered a chance at redemption, and revenge, through the mysterious offer of a retired businessman, etc.  What strikes me, now that I take the time to look back on the book in its entirety, is how poorly these components were executed and utilized.  I was left wondering if I had missed something, anything which explained why the novel didn't \\"come alive\\" for me as it had for so many others while only the The New York Times review made me feel sane for not gushing hyperbole over Larsson's work.  I figured a million Swedes couldn't be wrong but, as it turns out, I was.<br /><br />It may be somewhat of a misnomer to use the word \\"complaints\\" as most negative things about the book are really just disappointments.  The biggest letdown was how thoroughly unsatisfying the story was.  That first chapter left the impression that a whirlwind of intrigue and mystery was due to sweep me away at any moment; instead the first 40% of the book consisted primarily of uninteresting filler about such disparate and unimportant things as what certain characters were eating for lunch, the usefulness of a certain spreadsheet program, and the technical specifications of a particular laptop.  These digressions could have been forgiven if the rest of the book were to have made up for it in even the slightest fashion, but it sadly did not.  The story is so paper thin and cliche riddled that its almost an embarrassment to say that I plowed through to the end of what could probably have been an episode of CSI: Miami.  The climax leaves the reader with very little satisfaction for having been dedicated enough to keep going, and the revelation of the villain is almost entirely predictable because the author seems to have gone out of his way to drop hints just short of describing the character as the one with the noticeable mustache, top hat, and penchant for tying things to railroad tracks.<br /><br />All of this escapes the novel's main character which is not the girl with the dragon tattoo but is rather middle-aged journalist Mikael Blomkvist who is emblematic of how flat and dense the characters are.  He is, like most everybody else in the book, a reactionary only.  There is literally nothing in the book that gives the impression that he is a skilled investigator or in any way possesses superior abilities to any other guy walking by on the sidewalk, and, as luck would have it, the story proves just how unremarkable he is.  Events happen, Blomkvist muses on it for a while and then waits until the next event takes place.  Indeed, the big break in the story comes not from Blomkvist but rather by an incredibly random and fortunate visit from his daughter who is only really mentioned at that one instant in the novel.  As I said, Blomkvist is the poster boy for the larger problem faced by all of the characters: they leave you with no reason to \\"root\\" for them.  Even the title character, who is perhaps somewhat more sympathetic, is still so thoroughly pidgeonholed that one expects the next big twist to be that she has feathers and can fly.  When so many books can offer characters, stories, and experiences that are so rich and nuanced The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo feels strangely antiquated and not with the patina of a classic quality that continues to endear so many older works to our hearts.<br /><br />I wanted so much to like this book, but the myriad disappointments were so inescapable that I found myself being annoyed with the book for significant amounts of time.  The wasted capital of all the good ideas that could have made the book truly remarkable is what ultimately sank the entire experience, though a mostly superfluous first third of the book didn't help much.  I imagine that perhaps some of the book's appeal and wild popularity in Sweden was that it touched on themes and topics very germane to that country and which are somewhat less prominent here.nce, though a mostly superfluous first third of the book didn't help much.

B007OUFESC|4.0|If director David Cronenberg's early films like Videodrome and The Fly were concerned about \\"the new flesh\\", then his most recent efforts have been fascinated with \\"the new mind.\\"  It might be the drug addled world of Naked Lunch or the disturbed mind of Spider or the amoral world of Eastern Promises, but the director has gone from visceral horror into more intellectually disturbing terrain.<br /><br />And \\"A Dangerous Method\\" fits this world view quite well.  I was leery of seeing this film since it generated very mixed reviews, with some people loving it and others finding it tedious.  I liked it a lot and think the problem is that this is really two films.  On the surface everything is Victorian prim and proper.  Except for some naughty spanking scenes, the film has few Cronenbergian flourishes.<br /><br />But go one level deeper and follow what everyone is talking about and things get more disturbing.  When Carl Jung uses Freud's experimental \\"talking method\\" on a new female patient Sabrina Spielrein, we get into a world of sexual repression, adulterous affairs, mysticism versus hedonism, and hints of European Anti-Semitism on the eve of World War II.  There may also be an intellectual menage a trois going on here - with Jung as ego rebelling against superego father figure in Freud and Spielrein as id (and Vincent Cassel's hedonistic Otto Gross could serve as Libido, I guess).<br /><br />Cerebral and complex, and let's be honest, dialogue heavy in quite a few places, this is not an action packed film.  But it is an intellectually challenging and provocative multi-level film, with superb cinematography and fine performances by all the leads.<br /><br />I must admit I am a fan of director Cronenberg - but I am not blind to his faults.  He can be very distant and aloof as a director - M Butterfly was definitely not his best effort and Spider left me cold.  I found Dangerous Method challenging and involving from start to finish.  In his early film Scanners, Cronenberg had a famous scene where a human head literally explodes.  Cronenberg is still there in your head, just messing with it in an entirely new way.

B005LAIIS0|1.0|Horrible movie! Don't waste your time and money! The only goog thing is that I PAID to see 'Chronicle', which is a lot better then expected and I'm looking forward to watching Chronicle again.  After that movie, I thought I would see another movie...  2 for the price of 1.  However, I should have just left the theater.  The Grey sucks!  I wasn't the only one in the theater who was pissed, and booing after.  The ending, or lack of, made The Grey 100 times worse! boooo!!!
0307237702|5.0|This is a powerful, inspring non-fiction book by President Obama, written a few years before he took office.  Included is a thorough background on American politics and history.  He is truly a man of great character and integrity and that shows here.  He emphasizes values like compassion and fairness.  As a nation, we are stronger when we work together and look our for each other.  Topics like discrimination, class warfare, economics, and social issures are well discussed here.  One gains great insight into the political process from reading this book.  Obama's education and intellect are readily apparent.  We need to re-establish the middle class and make significant progress in this country.  I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend this book.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|just like all the other reviews, it took me a few minutes to figure out how to exit the game, but it never caused me to shut down my kindle.  my biggest complaints are one, how pricy things get and two, how easily I spent money accidentally clicking something. I decided to spend the 1.99 to get 20 extra acorns and I accidentally double clicked and it spent all of them buying a new plot of land when I didn't need one!!! that annoyed me. otherwise, this game was cute and actually pretty enjoyable for me.
B0032KPE0G|1.0|The movie was absolutely horrid! I was looking for something fun to watch with family and a son about to be married. I mentioned that 19902 had great movies--but this was totally stunk. I was ashamed I bothered to watch it. Both main characters were ridiculous people. I absolutely thought Hugh Grant was the most wishy washy sleazy shmuck ever and Andie McDowell was such a tramp. yuck.
B007SSDS24|1.0|This movie makes no sense at all and it seemed like the writers were just pulling plot point out of their butt. First the lights can go over water then at the end they won't cross water. Glass blinds them yet they have broken glass PLENTY of times to get to their target. Metal shark cages...\\"just work\\" WTH?!? So the lights can tear down buildings made of glass and metal yet these things are weaknesses whenever the writers need an excuse to keep the main characters alive for a while longer. One of the main characters is a douche bag who for some reason is able to say just the right thing that would make total strangers risk their lives for his whims.<br /><br />Example, he and his group get saved by some strangers, then they ask them to take them to the submarine that is just randomly waiting for any survivors. Of course the strangers would say no. However, he's says \\"What's the point in saving people if you won't see them home.\\" LOL!! yeah he actually says that and of course the strangers are fine with risking their lives just to escort them to their way out. Then they get to the sub and the man in charge is ready to leave...naturally as the lights are coming and already destroyed another boat. The main guy begs and pleads about how *he* can't leave his girlfriend of three days and of course the NAVY soldier is okay with that and risk his sub and the lives of his crew for one girl.<br /><br />Then at the end the main douchebag character is with his girlfriend of three days on the sub with their steampunk like weapons looking over military maps like they are in charge. LOL! All around stupid movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|really fun game, but the only way to exit it by going into the options. overall a good game though.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The show at time lagged and I found myself fast fowarding. But it's always entertaining. I can't wait to see where the characters go in the new season.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|The action is fast paced and exciting.  It is definitely a well written book.  But we have seen this plot before, and it is almost like he is using a formula.  I wish he would stick to The Camel Club series.<br /><br />Not going to ruin it, but i figured out who the bad guy was once they were introduced, very early on in the novel.  There really was no other reason to introduce this character, so to me it was obvious.<br /><br />As for the end, if you read Hard Wire by Harlon Coben, you saw this coming a mile away.<br /><br />Again, Dave is a great writer, and his novels are fast paced with plenty of action, but the last two have been stale.<br /><br />Zero Day was a Lee Child/Jack Reacher rip off, and as I stated above, fans of Harlon Coben knew what was coming.

B007549W62|3.0|I saw this movie on demand. I expected a doomsday sort of movie with strong character development due to the isolation. I also expected plenty of disturbing scenes which this movie delivers. However the story is weighed down in what i can only  classify as bad writing, bad acting, or bad improvisation. The director of this picture wanted improvisation which hurt this movie. The acting was so wooden its as if the actors were at a loss for words. The director also wanted to keep the camera off the actors so they would actually be pissed at one another. Why? Actors get paid to ACT. Let the actors ACT. This movie needed a solid script and solid direction. The divide could have been better in the hands of a better director.
B005LAIGLO|2.0|The storyline was a great idea but the execution was terrible. This totally bored me to death. I usually like Mark Wahlberg movies, but even this one, he couldn't make it good. I just sat there wishing it would just end already. He basically did drug carrying before, but went straight afterwards.<br /><br />Now, he needs to do one more job or his family will die. Pretty basic. He manage to do it, of course. Then, it all worked out at the end. Nothing too great worth mentioning happened in the movie.<br /><br />No one should but this movie, and even renting would be a bad idea. Nothing worth wild to see at all. Maybe it was just the trailer that got everyone excited about this one, but the actual movie fails to deliver.
B004J1DBJI|3.0|This app would be a wonderful thing if it wasn't force closing so often. Simple searches frequently kill it. If it isn't fixed soon i'm uninstalling.
B005D4YONW|5.0|Third pair of these and the other two pairs lasted 3 hard year each. Hiking, beaches, boating and around all summer. Wet or dry they are great and give good support to my arthritic feet.

B00634GHJA|4.0|I am not sure why everyone keeps saying it is the same as Dropbox or SugarSync; it is not.  That is like saying Dropbox is the same as a Windows Workgroup file share, IT IS NOT!  Dropbox is a server-client synchronization model, this product is a peer-to-peer model; these are not the same!  The difference is, one has a middle-man that is out in the cloud, and therefore limited by whatever the upload limit of your current broadband connection (Dropbox).  THIS product is a local network only sharing application, which can go as fast as your wireless can carry it to the other device or computer.  I hate to rant, but am tired of all the sheeple repeating the same mis-informed tripe!<br />This app is a good alternative for users who do not have a rooted device, and can not setup Samba. It is better than Dropbox in the respect that it is faster, and is peer-to-peer rather than having to first upload the photos to the \\"cloud\\" to share them with somebody else.  Also, it does not require the other user to have a Dropbox account, or that the other user have knowledge of using Dropbox. Ways that could make the app better are:<br />1). The ability to send a message with the URL within the app via TXT or email to somebody.  This would circumvent the issue another use mentioned about having to pop in and out of the app again just to send the URL.<br />2) Add the option of sharing any type of file, why just photos? This app could potentially share other types of files.<br />3) Make it so that the folder/file selection screen is sorted or able to be sorted.  Trying to navigate the dozens of folder the app found photos in is tedious.<br />4) Possibly add an advanced options menu to enable features like sharing on a 3G connection (temporarily and with warnings).  Or perhaps the ability to specify folders to list when sharing.
0817439390|5.0|One of the best photography books about exposure! The book is full of practical and easy to understand examples.<br /><br />Great job! Highly recommended!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is the best Bible app on the market. it's FREE, and it is available no matter what device you are using. even acceptable on a computer. Log in, and it is all your notes and highlights from all devices. 1 of the biggest reasons I got the Fire. A must have for any Bible reader!!
0810994739|5.0|My daughter just loved it and could not stop reading. She read it aloud to me and the plot is really funny/interesting. She is 7 and is in the middle of 1st grade.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story.  I choose to read it rather than see the movie.  Great read!  Good character development, very interesting concept.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great historical fiction. There are many characters, which is a little hard to keep straight in the beginning, but that works itself out as the reading continues. The author hold your interest all the way through and does a great job of depicting the struggles of the era. It's an excellent read.
B006ON41FC|5.0|great little time killer with lots of mini goals to keep it interesting. very smooth graphically on my thrive. highly recommend.
B00634GHJA|5.0|excellent app nothing but the best.  Just make it a little more auto sync.<br /><br />App should be auto sync to trusted phones.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great app it lets you know what the weather for more than seven weeks I would recommend this for everyone but mostly travelers.
0810983915|5.0|My daughter just loved it and could not stop reading. She read it aloud to me and the plot is really funny/interesting. She is 7 and is in the middle of 1st grade.<br /><br />I recommend all the books from the series
0756603749|3.0|Not much really here.. was looking for USEFUL knots like camping, hiking, etc. but these are just more generic.. nothing practical.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game fun to unlock things great way to kill time!! plus this is a free app so u dont have anything to lose!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|challenging game. great game love it keep up the puzzles and keep them coming l cant wait to see what the new puzzles will be.
B004JHYRDQ|5.0|Another great work by Asimov. I just can't get enough of his work. Reading on a Kindle is the best way. I can finish one book and then get the next one and keep reading. Super easy way to get my \\"FIX\\"!
B00634GHJA|3.0|I should not be complaining as I got this app for free. But I personally find this app designed for technologically challenged users of IOS and Android devices let alone windows users. Albeit it does make Photo transfers easy with few clicks here and there.<br /><br />I personally prefer [[ASIN:B004HN2FY0 ES File Explorer]] as it is more robust and does a whole lot more than just transferring photos and videos. It can also stream from your PC, Connect to remote servers and has much better functionality.<br /><br />There are other application like [[ASIN:B006LR0XLM Dropbox]] & [[ASIN:B004KA1YE2 WiFi File Explorer]] which does similar functions mostly for free. The Developer must work hard to stand out in the crowd of free apps available with some *must* have features that differentiates from other free apps out there.<br /><br />Because it works just fine on my kindle fire I am giving it 3 stars. But there are vast room for improvements. As it stands. I do not see why someone like me would keep this app for just photo & video transfers and pay close to $2.
B00634GHJA|2.0|As another reviewer suggested, hooking up the USB cable is much easier and faster. This browser-based application is very awkward. It doesn't allow more than one video file at a time to be transferred. Typing in a URL is much too clunky. And, it doesn't seem to allow you to find all of your media files. I've uninstalled it. It's just not worth the effort. Transferring with USB, Bluetooth, or even email is so much easier. An even smarter idea is to upload media files to minus.com or another hosting site where you can keep back-ups and share your files publicly or privately.
B00634GHJA|5.0|like in the title, moved hundreds of photos from phone to tablet just that fast. thanks for a great app.
B0061DOEJI|5.0|The first time I heard Betty Wright sing was on the B-side of an Alice Cooper 45. She sang \\"No Tricks\\" with Alice Cooper, and to this day I still can hear her powerful words and voice. So when I saw Betty Wright with the Roots, I had to buy the album and see if her voice was still as powerful as I remembered. Yes, Betty Wright's voice is still as powerful as I remember, and I loved all the songs on this album. I listen to it all the time. If you want some serious sounds with a fabulous singer, check this album out. You won't be disappointed.
B00634GHJA|5.0|It worked great right out of the box, no problems at all! I used it to transfer files from my Samsung Galaxy Note to my laptop with Windows XP.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Made me think that what happened to Sarah could happen to any one of us in one way or another. Surprised it happened in France. I thought this happened only in Germany during the second world war. The book left me with many thoughts that still enter my mind from time to time. I have recommended this book to my friends.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this its like a mini arcade in one. its my favorite game on my kindle. I lalalalove it.
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|This is Train's best CD since Drops Of Jupiter.  Yes San Francisco did have that runaway hit Hey Soul Sister...and this CD lacks anything that radio friendly but the last 2 songs are among the best that the band has written to date.  my only quip on this cd is I hate the title track.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This is very well done. It has great HD graphics, plays well, best I have seen. Using on a Kindle Fire.
B00634GHJA|3.0|If you can transfer pics and video why not music or docs. There are other Alps you can do this with and more, without limitations.
B003O86FMW|5.0|While this book angered me at times and made me want to shout \\"Not fair!!\\" I loved it just as much as the first in the trilogy. Ms. Collins offers up characters who evoke strong admiration, respect and hope. I can never anticipate what's coming!! I'm truly going to hate to see the end of this series!
B00634GHJA|5.0|great app. FYI you will also need to have this app on the other devices you use to get pictures.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101-in1 games is Kitty Cool. It's the best games in the world. It give you a chance to play new and cool GAMES!!!!!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Very close to giving it 5 stars.  I had a hard time putting it down and wanted to get to the end just to see what happens.  Signs of a great read.  One less star because of a tedious technique used in the book to indicate one of the speakers.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game was way fun! I'm a teenager and loved it!<br />great for any age. I say get it now! its free. why not?
B005K17RU0|4.0|Updates on the weather forecast are timely and the app is very easy to use.  I highly recommend this as a 'must have' for your Kindle.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Saying goodbye to this trilogy is difficult. Intense and thought-provoking! I don't believe I've ever read anything dealing with Apocalyptic circumstances that was better or more compelling. Found myself thinking that \\"yes, this is how it would probably be.\\" People would not have learned lessons from what brought them to this place in history. Selfishness and the desire for power would still rule the day. Politics and lies in the name of the \\"greater good\\" would run rampant. On the other hand there would be those willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the good of what humanity remains and those who would risk it all to bring hope.<br /><br />Labeling these books as being \\"young adult\\" material does them a great disservice and turns away readers who would love them as much as I did.<br /><br />I look forward to Ms. Collins future books and applaud her accomplishments with this magnificent tale!!<br /><br />Overall I loved the trilogy but this was my least favorite of the three...Seemed to drag a little at some points.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|some people just dont give this band the credit and respect they deserve and this band is truly and hard and heavy hitting metal/rock band and deserve respect and people when they look at some of godsmacks albums and talk crap about it and they need to stop and actually listen and if they still dont like it then they dont know their music at all and i know people have differnt taste in bands and music but still how could you not like this wonderful and kick ass band like GODSMACK. they are my favorite all time band and i think well better yet i know they are just as good as metallica and i love metallica as well but i like GODSMACK better but people should not talk bad about any of their albums because before you sit there and say oh this album or band isnt good well all i got to say is you better think twice pal because these guys have worked hard and long and deserve respect. THIS IS YET AGAIN ANOTHER FANTASTIC ALBUM BY THESE GUYS AND I HOPE THEY KEEP ROCKING HARD AND NEVER EVER GIVE UP EVEN WHEN THINGS GET HARD!!!!!!!!!! GODSMACK RULES THEY ARE #1............!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this album is worth the money so if you like godsmack or if you dont know much about them then you should get this album but regardless you should just buy it anyway and also all the rest of their albums because they are all really really really really really REALLY FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!
B0045HCJKS|4.0|1973's \\"Westworld\\" was cutting-edge entertainment at the time, featuring a high-tech resort at which guests could interact with life-like robots in each of three themed environments: the Old West, Imperial Rome, and Medieval Europe.  Richard Benjamin and James Brolin starred as guests who chose the Old West; Yul Brynner stole the show as a robot who goes off the rails.<br /><br />The opening sequences have Peter Martin (Bejamin) and John Blane (Brolin) arriving at the resort and indulging themselves drinking, fighting, and whoring in the Old West; the viewer learns the venue is set up to ensure the safety and satisfaction of guests in ingenious ways.  It includes interactive girls at a brothel and an aggressive gunslinger (Brynner) who starts gunfights but who always loses to the guests, including to a clumsy Martin.<br /><br />As the movie shifts to the technicians running the resort behind the scenes (with what now looks like hopelessly ancient equipment), it introduces concern about a virus that is corrupting the programming of the robots.  Suddenly, simple errors become deadly ones, as the Old West gunslinger cuts down Blane in an early morning gunfight, then relentessly pursues the hapless Martin.  The fleeing Martin cuts through the other venues in search of help, with the seemingly unstoppable gunslinger on his heels...<br /><br />\\"Westworld\\" looks and feels a lot like an early version of the \\"Terminator\\" movies.  If the high-tech and some of the acting looks less serious now, there is a real thread of horror snaking through the middle of the movie, of technology gone lethally wrong.  \\"Westworld\\" is still a worthwhile viewing experience.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Both of my kids and I love this game. We play together every day. It is very addicting. This game rocks!
B00634GHJA|5.0|I admit I am a bit challenged when it comes to computers and Apps--but this was so very simple, I opened the page on my computer like it said, and clicked the pics I wanted from my computer, and in seconds they were on my Kindle Fire!  (Have I mentioned how much I LOVE my Kindle Fire??)  Very happy with this!
B004LZF2LW|5.0|this app is perfect for the aviation industry. very impressed by what it offers. excellent widget too. thanks for making this one of the free apps!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a wonderful, wonderful book!! I could not put it down! I was captured by the story, the characters, and the possibilities of what the next page would hold from the moment I started it. I'm not saying anything more descriptive about the actual tale because it would be too easy to step into being a spoiler. I'll just say that I believe this is a book that has something for nearly every reader and I can't wait to start on the sequel! Kudos to Ms. Collins and my sincerest thanks for a thoroughly enchanting book.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|uni for the kindle fire is great! lots of fun. Worth the price. A great game to waste time with.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it great fun for all age's. I liked it &amp; so did my wife.  My son went wild trying to pass ever last game.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is soooooo fun. I love that it has goals to make it more interesting. I recommend everyone give this a try.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|Loved this book,couldn't put it down.Your never to old to enjoy a hot read.<br />I'm straight into the second novel and enjoying it just as much!I'm not sure<br />if I'm having hot flushes or it's Mr Grey??
B005LB1MY6|5.0|I'll start with the bad: the album is very short. Other than that, no complaints. I love this album.<br />The album flows together well as a whole if you listen to it all at once. A+<br />as for the actual disc itself, i purchased a lightly used one for cheap and there was not a scratch or spec on it.<br /><br />music: 5/5<br />disc: 5/5<br />packaging: 5/5<br />price: 5/5<br /><br />thank you!<br /><br />My opinion: The middle is the weakest part and the last few tracks are the best. #10 is my favorite.<br />Also, I found it interesting that they made the title track the last track.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Every once in a while, you see a film that is so unrelenting and emotionally devastating, that you can't help but admire and appreciate it's brutal honesty. This is definitely one of those movies. Requiem for a Dream is quite possibly the most emotionally powerful, and viscerally disturbing film I've ever seen. Darren Aronofsky certainly proved his talent as an auteur. There's so much to say about this film. It's extremely well acted by everyone involved, very well written, the story is deeply tragic and poignant, the editing is crisp and inventive, and the cinematography is dark and unsettling. Fans of Aronofsky, or even Danny Boyle's Trainspotting, will definitely want to feast their eyes on this masterpiece.
B0071W4KOM|5.0|Fiesta all night long. If I'm not one tree hill'ING it I'm not really happy. Long live Dan Scott, the greatest man of all time!
B004U52VPS|2.0|I bought this as a reward for my son who is Angry Birds crazy.  You've heard the expression you get what you pay for....well with this you overpay for what you get, junk.  Cheap plastic pieces and a few birds and a couple of pigs.  Slingshot made no sound so this one is even cheaper than another that is advertised.  My son played with the first few days but lost interest quick.  Very disappointed.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it if u like Mario get it I really love it<br />love it love it love it love it
B005723JSQ|4.0|If you're looking for an easy, entertaining read, then this is the book for you!  It's a cute little romance book, somewhat predictable.  If you like Kinsella's other novels,  you will enjoy this read!
0307352145|2.0|I was hoping that somewhere in this book Susan Cain would have mentioned Asperger's Syndrome.  Granted, I'm only three-fourths of the way into it, but I don't think I can finish it.  How can she talk about introverts and not mention Asperger's?  She hits on all the similar \\"symptoms\\" that introverts share with Aspies, so why not research that as well?  I think it would have explained the introvert psyche even better.  Her introvert research seems unfinished without the Asperger's research.  Disappointing.
B00000G3PA|2.0|Fade in.  closeup.  action. cue music. close up. sentimental.  closeup. closeup.  action. cue music.  close up. sentimental.  the end.<br /><br />A typical over the top American movie that shows unity and pride.  Ben Afleck desperate tries to be the golden boy and become Bruce's adopted son a la Ashton Kutcher.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Bared  to You by Sylvia Day<br /><br />Exposed can be a vulnerable feeling. In Bared to You by Sylvia Day the author takes her main characters through so many life changing experiences that you can see into their souls. It is amazing how much people from two different worlds have so much in common.<br /><br />Bared to You penned by Sylvia Day is an exciting, suspense and action packed sensuously, exhilarating novel that flows smoothly and transports the reader right in the middle of the lives of two attractive and intelligent people and the experiences that are dropped in of their young lives.<br />Ms. Day's writing style is wonderful, flows easily as she portrays the environment, the characters, their experiences in such a dramatic way. Through Ms. Day's writing all of your senses are titillated.<br />I related to all of the different environments Ms Day formulated to enhance the vibe which uplifted the highly charged conversations between the characters.<br /><br />Bare to You brings into your world the ups and downs of real people with characteristics that are familiar and perhaps match those who are members of your family. Through the development of the characters, plot, rising action and resolution this story is so mesmerizing. In my personal opinion,  Bared to You should come with a warning label. \\"Don't crack the cover of this delicious and compelling book if you don't have a relaxing day to devote to it\\". Cookies and food cooking on the stove will burn because you will be so involved in the anticipating the next event as the you penetrate  the characters' private worlds.<br /><br />Cary Taylor, Eva Tramell, Gideon Cross are unpredictable; along with the pictorial elements of the key supporting characters entrenched this sexy, intriguing tale.  I found myself caught up in the high energy of the hustle and bustle of the city of New York and the opulence of the family members of Eva and Gideon.<br /><br />At twenty-something the Gideon Cross is dark, tall, muscular, intelligent and extremely sensuous.  Victor's determination dictates a no nonsense reputation and force to be reckoned with. Gideon mere presence in a room of key company executives and CEO's  of corporations is so commanding it reminds me of hush in the atmosphere of a room entered by The President of the United States. Gideon is quite the man and has mad skills in any setting or situation. He knows how to get what he wants with out raising his voice or physical threats and does not accept nor understand of the vocabulary associated with: can't, no, or any type of uncertainties.<br /><br />Eva Tramell also in her twenties is gorgeous, with drop dead, alluring body wrapped around fantastic critical thinker with a fast analytical mind and is a dedicated member of any agency or company that employs her. Eva embodies the grace, classiness any advertising company would kill to have as a member of its team. Eva talents often manifest themselves on the job on key accounts for one of New York's finest advertising companies.<br /><br />Cary Taylor is a beautiful model who is Eva's best friend from childhood and now her roommate. Cary is a comforting anchor for Eva when life tries to whip her butt.<br /><br />Bare to You  has some of the hottest moments of intimacies, fantasies one could imagine. Ms. Day's writing fluidity in her story drives the me and perhaps other readers to edges of their mind. It appears to me that if I inhaled an extra breath while on the luscious, carnal trip I would be in state that would be impossible to retrieve me. Ms. Day takes the reader and I to a super duper realm of ecstasy that will stay with you for a long time. The fantasies that she has reveals are daunting.<br /><br />Bared to You  pulls back some of the hidden emotions each of us have sheltered under the numerous  layers like those of an onion.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading Bare to You  by Sylvia Day but I caution you to hold on tight as you sail the waves that are heavilyelectrified with emotional, physical and psychological locales you will visit through this hypnotizing story.
B00634GHJA|1.0|this is stupid, just e-mail pictures to yourself or anyone else, and get them on your computer or other device!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its kool<br />it is an interesting game to play but too many adds.<br />I like lots of challenges and with a kindle kids all love to play.
B004LROUW2|3.0|It was an effort to read this. To me it was a romance with a fantasy twist<br />It would have been better had i been more interested in romantic novels.  Two young people who must meet but never can... At least they were geeky rather than gorgeous.  It has an interesting plot but i was not \\"lost\\" in the novel. I had to force myself not to skim.  Perhaps it was the translation from culture to culture.<br /><br />I suspect most people will like it better than me somehow.
145162445X|2.0|Just one more book without any answers.<br /><br />If you hoped this book might tell you how the universe began, why there is order in the universe, or why there is anything at all, you will be disappointed.  Despite the title the author doesn't have a clue.<br /><br />The author essentially says that everything rose from nothing.  But he is twisting the definition of \\"nothing.\\"  His \\"nothing\\" has rules to it and has a potential in it to create ordered universes.  And he has no answer as to where this radical version of \\"nothing\\", which is actually not nothing, came from.  In other words he just added another turtle to the stack of turtles all the way down and claimed he had solved the problem.<br /><br />The writing style is problematic.  Parts of it are so simplistic as to be at a high school level.  And other parts are written so obscure that they might as well be in Sanskrit.  And just to be even more annoying, throughout the text he makes out of context cheap shots at organized religion while offering no alternatives.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  If you are sincerely looking for answers you won't find them here.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have YouVersion on my Kindle Fire, iPAD, and Blackberry Torch, and I absolutely love it!!!!!! I have reccomended it to all of my friends!!!

034552554X|5.0|I loved this book from cover to cover. The author has created characters and scenarios so real that you feel like you are living the moments with them, rather than just reading about them. The storyline, centered around 'the language of flowers' and how it ultimately brings hope and the promise of new life, is so refreshingly different from anything I've read before. The heroine, Victoria, has lived a lonely life in the foster care system and after 18 years without the proper nourishment of love & a place to belong (which most of us take for granted), she is left to make her way in the world, alone and friendless. Having never learned proper social etiquette or any useful life skills, her situation seems pretty hopeless, as she is forced to sleep in a public park and eat only what she can steal. Yet, what she is eventually able to accomplish with only a will to survive and a gift for communicating with flowers will make you believe that no situation is ever truly hopeless and that there is always a way to start again. It will also make you stop and think twice about your actions toward others and whether or not you are 'watering' them or cutting them down. A true Must Read for every book lover!
B006R1T40I|4.0|Bonnie Raitt's third album this century, \\"Slipstream,\\" is everything a Raitt fan would want. Her earthen, gritty voice, that great, blusey slide guitar of hers, some choice covers (Bob Dylan, Gerry Rafferty), selections from old friends (Joe Henry, Louden Wainwright III) and the longing attitude mixed with confident swagger that made her best records (\\"Nick of Time,\\" \\"Give it Up\\") such long loved releases. \\"Slipstream\\" alternates between the blues she so loves - love the way she turns Dylan's \\"Million Miles\\" into a biting question of lover's remorse - and the punch she gives to \\"Used to Rule the World\\" and rocking \\"Split Decision.\\"<br /><br />Two more tracks here merit mention, Henry's \\"God Only Knows\\" and the late Gerry Rafferty's \\"Right Down The Line.\\" Rafferty gets a subtle reggae pulse and is the obvious single, and does what most covers don't; equals the original. \\"God Only Knows\\" (not Brian Wilson's) is a hard knock piano ballad that Raitt (who lost both her parents prior to this album) gives such an emotive reading of that it closes the album perfectly. Time may have been hard leading up to the album itslef, but kind to Raitt's talents. \\"Slipstream\\" is a solid album, and will likely wear well as the years pass.

B00634GHJA|5.0|Excellent application, one I wouldn't hesitate to purchase. It makes sharing photos and my families photos extremely easy fast to do. I can also swap my photos between my phones and tablets. I've not tried sharing with my computers yet but I will soon. Thanks for an awesome program!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very fun and a good game for anyone. controls take some getting used to but that doesn't hamper the fun
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is the first online review I have written about any product. I am a long time reader of mostly sci-fi and fantasy. I have to say this is one of the most original stories I have read in awhile. The action was fast paced for the most part, and the characters were well defined. I also give the author credit for delivering his tale in this manner. A truly enjoyable experience. I am looking forward to more from this author and the world of silos.
0756405890|5.0|ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO I DECIDED TO BROADEN MY HORIZONS AND READ SOME SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY.  I BEGAN BY RESEARCHING NOVELS THAT WON BOTH THE HUGO AND NEBULA AWARDS IN THE SAME YEAR AND MOVED ON FROM THERE.  THE MAJORITY OF THESE AWARD WINNING NOVELS ARE SEGMENTS IN A SERIES, AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE FIRST SEGMENT.  THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS, ENDERS GAME, AND SEQUEL SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD BOTH WHERE HONORED THROUGH WINNING BOTH OF THESE PRESTIGIOUS SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY AWARDS.  THE OTHER BOOKS IN THE SERIES WERE REMARKABLE AS WELL.  I HAVE FOUND THAT TO BE TRUE WITH MANY OF THESE SERIES, AND I AM NOW A FULLY DEDICATED SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY READER.<br /><br />I HAVE READ MOST OF THE GREATS.  I DEFINE GREATNESS IN THESE CLOSELY RELATED GENRES THROUGH IMMORTALITY....STORIES THAT WILL LIVE FOREVER, AND THE AUTHORS NAMES THAT ARE STAMPED TO THEM.  THERE ARE MANY TO CHOSE FROM, FOR ME IT WAS ASIMOV AND THE FOUNDATION NOVELS, DAN SIMMONS AND THE HYPERION QUARTET (PROFOUNDLY UNDER RATED) AND TO A SLIGHTLY LESSER EXTENT THE ORIGINAL FRANK HERBERT DUNE NOVELS, AND CARD'S ENDER NOVELS.  I AM LEAVING OUT SO MANY AND I WOULD BE REMISS TO LEAVE OUT TOLKIN AND THE LORD OF THE RING NOVELS WHICH ARE UPPER ECHELON HALL OF FAMERS.<br /><br />RECENTLY IN READING THROUGH THE GAME OF THRONES NOVELS, I THOUGHT GEORGE RR MARTIN MAY HAVE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF FIRMLY AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. ALL OF THAT IS NOW IN THE PAST BELONGING TO A DIFFERENT ERA, A TIME BEFORE KVOTHE WAS INTRODUCED TO THE WORLD.<br /><br />PATRICK ROTHFUSS BECAME AN IMMORTAL IN THE FIRST 100 PAGES OF THE NAME OF THE WIND.  THIS NOVEL IS THE FIRST OF A TRILOGY WHICH INVOLVES AN ENIGMATIC AND SEEMINGLY DESPONDENT INN-KEEPER WHO IS ACTUALLY A POWERFUL WIZARD OR ARCANIST.  HE IS A LEGEND, THE SUBJECT OF COUNTLESS TALES AND ADVENTURES.  HE IS ALSO PRESUMED DEAD.  EVENTUALLY A CHRONICLER IS INTRODUCED TO THE STORY AND PROCEEDS TO APPEAR IN THE INN (BY FATE OR DESIGN) AND RECOGNIZES THE FACT THAT THIS INN-KEEPER IS ACTUALLY KVOTHE, AND WITH THE HELP OF KVOTHE'S PROTEGEE, A MEMBER OF THE FAY NAMED BAST, THE IN-KEEPER IS FINALLY CONVINCED TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.  HE TELLS THE CHRONICLER THAT IT WILL TAKE 3 DAYS TO TELL HIS STORY WITH COMPLETE ACCURACY, AND EACH NOVEL IN THE TRILOGY IS TO REPRESENT ONE DAY.  THERE MIGHT BE SOME CYNICS OUT THERE WHO WILL ARGUE THAT IT TAKES MORE THAN ONE NOVEL TO MAKE AN AUTHOR AN ALL TIME GREAT, AND THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THAT.  ROTHFUSS WENT AHEAD AND FOLLOWED HIS MASTERPIECE WITH ANOTHER IN THE SECOND BOOK ENTITLED THE WISEMAN'S FEAR.  QUALITY TRILOGIES ARE SAID TO BE RARE.  IT TAKES SOMEONE SPECIAL TO MAKE A SEQUEL FLOW WITH THE SAME PACE AND LANGUAGE AS THE ORIGINAL.  ROTHFUSS TOOK HIS TIME IN PERFECTING THE SEQUEL.  HE WAS EAGER TO HEAR AS MUCH FEEDBACK AS POSSIBLE FROM READERS, LISTENING CAREFUL WHAT THEY WANTED MORE OF, AND EVEN WHAT THEY WANTED LESS OFF IN TERMS OF ASPECTS THAT ENDEARED THEM TO THE ORIGINAL.  THE MOST PAINSTAKING ASPECT OF THESE NOVELS IS HAVING TO WAIT FOR THE THIRD EDITION.  THE LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT BEGAN TO MOUNT FROM THE EARLIEST PAGES OF THE THE NAME OF THE WIND REMAINED AT THE CLOSE OF DAY 2 IN THE WISEMAN'S FEAR.  NAMELY HOW DID KVOTHE, A LEGEND OF EARTH SHATTERING PROPORTIONS END UP AN IN-KEEPER WHO HAS SEEMINGLY GIVEN UP ON LIFE.<br /><br />THE STORY IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX, TO THE EXTENT THAT I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO SUMMARIZE ANYMORE OF THE SCENE THAN I ALREADY HAVE.  WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN ON ANOTHER LEVEL.  THE NOVELS I MENTIONED EARLIER SUCH AS THE FOUNDATION, DUNE, ENDER, AND HYPERION WERE MIND BOGGLING STORIES OF THE SORT THAT IT PAINED ME TO HAVE TO PUT THE BOOKS DOWN TO MEET THE BASIC NECESSITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF DAILY LIFE.  GAME OF THRONES AGAIN, AN EPOCH ENTHRALLING STORY AND CHARACTERS THAT WILL LIVE FOREVER.<br /><br />HOWEVER, IF WE ARE BEING COMPLETELY HONEST WE MUST SAY THAT PATRICK ROTHFUSS WRITES ON ANOTHER STRATOSPHERE.  FORGET CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, DETAIL, AND DESCRIPTION WHICH HE IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST OF ANYONE IN ANY GENRE OF LITERATURE (MY HUMBLE, YET UNWAVERING OPINION).  ROTHFUSS IMAGINED AND WROTE FOR US THE FIRST TWO SEGMENTS OF WHAT SHOULD ONE DAY BE CATEGORIZED AS CLASSIC LITERATURE, MANDATORY READING FOR ENGLISH AND LITERATURE MAJORS AT ALL UNIVERSITIES.  ROTHFUSS NOT ONLY TANTALIZES US WITH A STORY IN WHICH DEMANDS EVERY OUNCE OF OUR ATTENTION, BUT HE ALSO WRITES IN A FASHION THAT MAKES WORDS READ AND APPEAR BEAUTIFUL.  THIS IS A DAY AND AGE IN WHICH A GOOD STORY OFTEN MASKS POOR TECHNICAL WRITING.  THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE GOOD AT THE ART OF STORYTELLING BUT LACKING IN THE SKILL OF LANGUAGE.  IF ANYBODY EVER DESERVED TO BE TOLD THAT THERE NOVEL WAS THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF POETRY, MUSIC, AND LYRICAL VERSE IN MOTION, IT IS PATRICK ROTHFUSS.  HIS WORK READS AS BEAUTIFULLY AS JOHN FOWLES IN THE MAGUS.  THE FIRST TWO 2 DAYS IN ROTHFUSS'S KINGKILLER CHRONICLES ARE NOVELS THAT RAISE THE STANDARD FOR STORY TELLERS AND DEFINE AN ERA OF LITERATURE.  THE NAME OF THE WIND, AND THE WISEMAN'S FEAR ARE EVERYTHING I HAVE SAID AND MORE.  IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE ANOTHER NOVEL MEASURING UP TO THESE PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF THE THIRD ONE.  IT'S GOING TO BE A WHILE, BUT IT WILL BE WORTH IT REGARDLESS OF TIME.  READ THESE TWO NOVELS, SOAK THEM UP, TAKE THEM IN, CONSIDER EVERYTHING THAT MAKES A STORY GREAT, AND ALL THAT IS INVOLVED IN CREATING BEAUTY THROUGH THE WRITTEN WORD, AND YOU WILL REALIZE THAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MASTER AUTHOR'S ETERNAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLD<br /><br />WORD OF THE DOVE, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTHAIL, AND DESCRIPTION WHICH HE IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST OF ANYONE IN ANY GENRE OF LITERATURE (MY HUMBLE, YET UNWAVERING OPINION).

0345803485|5.0|I never picked a book up to read before this. I couldn't stop! I read all 3 in one weeks time feeling sad when it came to a final end. Thank you for sharing E.L.
1451627289|1.0|I've read a few other Stephen King books that were pretty good, but this one.....eh. This book is far from what the title suggests or from what the inside leaflet describes. The book started off well, but then just takes a nosedive.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is awesome and really fun. I loved the original organ trail and love this too. its really similar to pioneer trail.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of different games to play! Many different skills are used in this game. Any one can okay these games no matter what age.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy is so well written, I couldn't wait to get back to the stories each time that I had to put down the book (Nook Tablet, in this case!!).  I highly recommend these stories to everyone, aged middle school to 100+!!!
B006I1OB0U|5.0|Ok. if you are tempted to skip this Downton Abbey, my advice is not to do so.  Not only is the whole episode good but we also have something occur which I have been waiting for during the prior two seasons.  If you are an avid fan and a romantic at heart, I am going to guess your reaction will be similar to mine.  You do not want to watch season three having missed this.<br /><br />As to other matters, the Bates' trial takes place in this episode along with its verdict.  The only person you do not see is Sybil because she is in Ireland with her husband. Her mother has already mended fences with her and her father is softening up.  So I fully expect to see her in season three.<br /><br />This is a highly satisfactory continuation of the series and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0307352145|5.0|Throughout history, and now more than ever, extroverts have been idolized for their behavior. Workplaces look for leaders to hire even churches encourage constant leadership from their members. Extroverts are seen as the life of the party, out going, and vibrant but where does that leave the introverts? According to research 1/3 to 1/2 of the population are introverts creating a great divide in the way we all function. The concept of introverts/ extroverts defines how we live our lives as such, and how we treat others that are not like us. This regulates how we act, how we think, and overall our personalities.<br /><br />Though extroverts are idolized, Cain shows that it is the introverts that make this world run. From Newton to Einstein, Warren Buffet to Rosa Parks this book describes how through their introverted personalities they have changed the way we view physics, economics, and civil rights among many other things. Often traits associated with being an introvert are viewed negatively in our society; no one admires the qualities of being shy, quite, to them selves, or sensitive. Cain, on the contrary, argues that both introverts and extroverts should admire such qualities whether in themselves or in others.<br /><br />If you are an extrovert Cain demonstrates that respect needs to be given to introvert, and not try and change them by throwing them into spotlight. And if you are an introvert, you should respect yourself and realize your true value and the endless possibilities that you too can change the world - even if it may be from the comfort of your room.<br /><br />Cain does an excellent job describing her research and telling stories, which leaves me, an introvert, with an oomph of respect for myself and others just like me.<br />This book is for introverts and extroverts alike. We all know introverts, we might be one, we might be married to one, have children that are introverts, work with them, or simply hangout with them. Regardless of our association Cain teaches us to value introverts and respect the people around us.<br /><br />Thank you to WaterBrook Multnomah for this free book, in exchange for this honest review.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I resisted reading this when my adult daughter recommended it.  BUT now I am so glad that I had a change of heart. Love this book.  It has so many layers to it.  It should NOT  be classified as Young Adult.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoyed Wool very much, I had just finished reading Ender's Game and was looking for more SCIFI and this came into view.  The 450-odd 5 star reviews are not wrong, this book is a very rewarding read.<br /><br />What I really liked was that people died... main characters (sheriff, mayor, mech boss, etc).  This reminded me somewhat of game of thrones in that respect, there is something about the death of someone you have come to understand a little, invested time in, it's a powerful tool. I liked how new characters, replacing them, are equally interesting. The setting was fascinating, it reminding me of Logan's run (the release from safety to a believed dead land) and of City of Ember (but darker).<br /><br />I have an interest in IT (it is my career) so this was an interesting take on the overall organisation.  I wonder about why IT was considered the core, the \\"holder of the secrets\\" so to speak.
B0059XTTW8|3.0|The movie is minimally acceptable.  It is a pale imitation of the version done by Masterpiece Theater starring Alec Guinness.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Can't say enough good about the Bob Marley documentary. Extremely well done, supremely interesting, wonderfully informing and moving. 5 stars out of 5, if you like Marley at all, you owe it to yourself to see it. What more could this man have done for the world if he had lived longer? It would certainly be a better place, of that I and I have no doubt whatsoever! Could you be loved? Then be loved!
B0050XH1H2|4.0|Vaccines sounds like everyone from Strokes, Interpol, to Heavens, The National, The Cribs to the Doves, We Are Augustines, you name it. Yet I feel like they stand alone as well. As a fan of many of the aforementioned bands, The Vaccines are a welcomed addition to my collection. I believe they are embodying a particular style and sound of a particular genre of this particular era that is obviously influenced by different bands of each era, dating back to the simplistic melodies of the fifties and sixties - so when people complain and argue that they are unoriginal, I'm not sure they have a good grasp of culture. None of these folks are completely original, only they find unique ways to express something that is already out there or on the cusp of being out there. But the way The Vaccines express this style and sound feels very genuinely emotional and personal. I feel like this is what makes bands in this genre stick out for me and I can't get enough of the Vaccines for the moment. That being said, I do believe that bands that offer or create an augmentation to the sound are creatively more admirable, influential and, in my mind, have more \\"staying\\" power. I am not sure The Vaccines really add or augment anything significantly to that point rather than just fitting comfortably within the genre. So while their tunes are stuck in my head at the moment, I would give them four stars for grasping the genre while maybe not taking it to that extra level.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|One of the best games I have  ever played I love the animations and the lighting strikes awesome.And I love the charms that you can get from the store the are really helpful

B00000K3D4|5.0|LABYRINTH is a real cool movie...the story is nice and the visual effects are great...i've seem this classic more than 5 times, and it's one of the most memorable films i ever seem!!! CLASSIC!!!!
B005LAIGWS|1.0|Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is the worst Marvel Comics movie to date... Yes, it's worse than Daredevil, Elektra, and to those who hated it, Ang Lee's HULK. The first GHOSTRIDER film is superior in every way, so stick with that. I fear the mighty Marvel movie machine will soon run out of steam, after the Avengers have their time in the spotlight. The upcoming \\"Amazing Spider-Man\\" looks really lame, too...
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|really good but tookntoo long to become avaolilable for the kindle fire it should have at least only cost 4.99
0066620996|5.0|I didn't think that this book would be worth reading when the head principal of my building \\"recommended\\" it. I was wrong. I had just finished \\"Outliers\\" and the timing was perfect. The themes of hard work and focus are lessons that I can take both into the classroom and my personal life. Definitely worth your time, and probably your money.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a great game it is simalar to super Mario bros so I would recommend this is you like Mario bros and those. types of games.
B00081912E|5.0|THE MASK is a real funny movie...i saw on the cinema back in the early 90´s, and it´s this film that elevates JIM CARREY to a super mega remarkable actor...after the mask, jim made many great films...Maybe his most relevant movie, i don´t know...REALLY FUNNY!!!!

0312323867|5.0|This book was so good. Once you get past all the re-telling of things you already know from reading Something Borrowed, it is fantastic. I couldn't put it down.... read it in 2 nights.
B0053O89WY|1.0|The show is not funny and it's so annoying! It is also stupid. Also it is the worst show I ever seen!
159562015X|3.0|I didn't realize that I shouldn't buy this book used because the code that unlocks your results can only be used once. My advice would be to only buy this book new. And if someone is selling it used they should advise you that it won't be complete.
0451208706|5.0|I loved the book, full of interesting people and places that I have never been but would like to visit.  Full of insite into the characters, lots of action - great summer read.

B004UXUUJE|4.0|I had previously seen this movie at a movie house.  But, as it usually happens you allways miss something.  So I got it and I can review it at my leisure.  Surelly I will find somethig new that will help me enjoy it even more.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was not a major fan of post apocalyptic fiction until I started on a zombie obsession this past year. When Hugh Howey came to visit my adolescent literature class, he brought along with him his Wool series. After being able to read a few pieces of the first book, as it was passed around, I was hooked. Wool is one of the most captivating series that I have read in a long time. After reading the first two, I had to go ahead and purchase the rest of the series through kindle. Once I had finished, I was so anxious to know if there was a 6th book, and now I can not wait to read it! Even though I have all of them on kindle, I'm very anxious to buy the hard copy of the Wool Omnibus Edition, just to add it to my great collection of books. This is a great book for any age, and I highly recommend this series. To make it even better, Hugh Howey is working on his zombie book, which as a zombie fanatic I am ecstatic about. READ IT!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game likes Mario game. so fun when play it with my kid. many thanks and hope more update in future
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great books! Characters are well developed and the plot keeps moving. No slow spots here. Can't wait for the rest of the series!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much!  It kept me intrigued to the very end. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B00634GHJA|1.0|I cant even install it says app space is full after I uninstalled 20 games it takes up to much space!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun..cant wait for more games and items.ive been playing for hours its very entertaining.my kids love it too!<br />:) cant wait for some new updates
0451169514|3.0|I love Stephen King's writing and the plot of It. I thought it was scary, dark, and I never felt like the scenes were boring. I would have given this one a 5 star review, but the scene (!!SPOILER SPOILER!!) where Beverly Marsh (11 years old) takes off her pants (after crawling around in garbage and human waste in the sewers) tells the boys (6 of them) to line up so they can all have sex with her. I could understand if this was written in a way that does not condone this behavior, but SK is trying to connect this scene with positivity. Like the ultimate friendship circle. I know this story is fiction, but child sex/porn should never be acceptable in literature or movies. Anyone who admits to \\"liking\\" this scene is sick and should never be left alone with children. With that being said, I will still buy SK books, but I will thoroughly read the negative reviews before I buy.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I must confess my 4yr old showed me this game at Best Buy. 20mins later I couldn't believe how much time pasted. time flies when your having fun.
1594744475|5.0|I LOVE this book!  It has some of the cutest ideas i've ever seen!  I have yet to receive my bento box (coming from Japan), but i'm already starting to take some ideas from here for mine and my daughter's lunches.  What I really like about it is you can substitute for your own recipes if you wanted.  You can swap out ingredients and make it your own.  My daughter does not eat peanut butter, but she loves jelly sandwiches.  At 21 months old, her taste is constantly changing, so lunch must be ever changing.  But always cute!  This book is a great starting point if you're new to Bento, as I am.  It's great portion control and a fantastic way to put a smile on you and your family's faces!  So, have fun and play with your food!!!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This clock really help me it's nice with added clock it help get up on time.  The clock is much bigger then other on my streak
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I enjoy the upbeet music in the background but unfortunately it onlybseems to fit the mood of the first level or so.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The kids and I love it. It reminds me offend Super Mario Bros. I highly reccomend it forages four and up.
B001F1YBPI|4.0|I asked myself if I enjoyed this more than just listening to the CD. I think the answer is no. It was a lively performance with the principles standing, but I think this format is for the larger symphonies and concertos. As far as Claudia Abbado he seemed to be unnecessary and therefore I am glad he was kept out of sight. As one of the reviewers alluded is the conductor allowed to expand the ensemble. This music is so beautiful that I would have liked to have heard it with a tripled ensemble. If you love Bach by all means get this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun and entertaining! you never get bored and never gets old new things keep coming at you an awesome game
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love the sync capability.  This application is one of the best out there.  I wish it had better free text capabilities.
B0055SWM08|5.0|'Purchased' when it was the free app of the day for me, I believe that you would still love it for even more than the current price of $0.99.  I use it on my Kindle Fire and find that it works without a hitch.<br /><br />The numerous paintings used for the backgrounds are beautifully done; the whole theme reminding me of spending holiday in a country cottage in the early Spring (flowers blooming with just a few sprinkles of rain).<br />The harp music is a perfect counter-part to the setting of solving the mazes on a pane of glass trickling with raindrops.<br /><br />I believe those who are looking for a way to transport themselves away from the stresses of their lives and find a Zen-like inner peace through mind-engaging, puzzle-solving meditation will find this app beneficial to their lives, health and peace of mind. I certainly have and I look forward to using it every day.  I think that you will as well.  :-)
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl by Rebecca Hamilton takes a different look at the vampire genre in her paranormal fantasy novel with aspects of paranormal romance, urban fantasy and mystery. Rebecca Hamilton creates a world and characters that come to life and grab hold of you right from beginning. After receiving this book from the author herself after winning a contest on her Twitter stream, I was soon hooked on Sophia's story of determination, learning who she really is, where she came from, and the existence of a world she never could have dreamed of in her wildest dreams.<br /><br />I was drawn to Sophia because she wasn't this supernatural, kick-ass girl - at least not at first. Sophia started out as a young woman who felt that she should be allowed to practice her beliefs even though they are not accepted by her surrounding community. She is a young woman who did not let other people's fears of what they didn't understand chase her out of town, instead she stood up them and stood her ground. Soon, Sophia found herself drawn into a world she didn't know existed before, found a strength she never knew she possessed, and became a champion for change in a world she was still learning about.<br /><br />Rebecca Hamilton is an author of the paranormal/urban fantasy genre to keep an eye on and I look forward to reading more by her.

B007PTJOV0|4.0|fun.  very similar to Mario.  it is a good time waster.  having a speed run would be a nice addition.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great little game, even for those of us without great abilities at these types of games. easy to play.get this app.
B0055S348W|2.0|I didn't realize there was a free version to run a test page for compatibility so I downloaded the paid version before testing. lo and behold it wont work directly from my kindle fire to my wifi printer. so now I just wasted $7 on a useless app. maybe it will work someday....

1451627289|4.0|I remember when I first heard about a book on time travel and the Kennedy assassination was going to be released by Stephen King, I was overwhelmed with joy. I have always been a huge King fan and have most of his novel in first editions. This book has been one of the most interesting books I have read by King because of the way the story is told. For example, many of my friends who are long time King fans felt like they were cheated by the way the plot resolves at the end. They didn't feel like King had done justice to them after reading an 800+ page book. I feel as if I wasn't too far behind them in feeling the same way. The thing about this novel is, you have to remember that it isn't done in a way that seems supernatural like many of Kings other books. Jake, the main character, behaves just like a real person would and has normal experiences (besides time traveling of-course)throughout most part of the book. It is in this aspect however, that the book accomplishes what it was made to do. Jake is very believable and many times throughout the story you find yourself asking the same questions that Jake does. I love the fact that King was able to take such a popular science fiction idea such as time traveling, and incorporate it in a way that is believable. Jake is no super hero that is invincible, who gets away with everything simply because he already knows the future. He is a normal guy who is stuck in the past due to a promise he made to an old friend that he would stop JFK's assassination and will do anything in his power to see it done. Many times he is scared and questions his ability to perform his task, other times he feels sympathy towards Oswald because he sees a side of him that only people who were closest to him would ever see. You feel this throughout the book and that's when you realize, Jake isn't so different than us. I give this book four stars simply because I expected more from the rising action and the climax. I felt that the events leading up to November 22nd were a little TOO realistic for my taste. It was hard to read things like Jake having a normal day without nothing happening. Several pages of this or even a chapter of this would have been fine, but it was a big chunk where nothing is really happening, other than Jake spying on Oswald. I'll give King credit for making things seem so realistic, but for a fiction novel, It would of been better if more supernatural things were added. The Man with the Yellow Card was an excellent addition and it was more of those kinds of things that I felt the novel needed. Besides the beginning of the novel, the last three or two chapters were the ones I enjoyed the most. That is when all the things that make me love Stephen King came out; the supernatural, time traveling, The Green Card Man, and the very interesting ending. The fiction parts of the book is where this novel excelled. If there was more emphasis on the time travel or more development with JIMBLA or even an entirely new element, this book would have been flawless. In the end however, I greatly enjoyed this book and would recommend it for someone looking at a realistic approach at someone trying to change the past and do the impossible.to November 22nd were a little TOO realistic for my taste. It was hard to read things like Jake having a normal day without nothing happening. Several pages of this or even a chapter of this would have been fine, but it was a big chunk where nothing is really happening, other than Jake spying on Oswald. I'll give King credit for making things seem so realistic, but for a fiction novel, It would of been better if more supernatural things were added.

That is when all the things that make me love Stephen King came out; the supernatural, time traveling, The Green Card Man, and the very interesting ending. The fiction parts of the book is where this novel excelled. If there was more emphasis on the time travel or more development with JIMBLA or even an entirely new element, this book would have been flawless. In the end however, I greatly enjoyed this book and would recommend it for someone looking at a realistic approach at someone trying to change the past and do the impossible.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is a really captivating and intense book that catches the reader's attention from page 1 and has a great plot with really interesting characters. The story revolves a post-apocalyptic America and there are 12 Districts which ranks people in a class-type system. District 12 is the poor class and each District above ranks higher and higher. Protagonist Katniss Everdeen lives with her family in District 12 and hunts for food for her family with her friend Gale. Once a year, \\"The Hunger Games\\" are held throughout all 12 districts, and it involves picking 1 boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to fight each other to the death and specially designed arenas. When all of the youth gathers up to be chosen, Katniss's younger sister, Prim, is chosen and Katniss steps in and volunteers to take her place. The boy on her team, Peeta, had saved her family's life from starvation so she felt guilty that she would be fighting to kill someone that saved her life. One aspect that's really unique is that you feel like you're always in Katniss's head because she thinks a million questions at once and she thinks the way a true hero does. Before these Hunger Games take place, the 24 chosen ones have to go through interviews and training for the games, and everything is shot on TV for everybody to see; so families  of the chosen ones actually watch their children die. In the arena, Katniss is very different compared to the others. She makes friends with a few of the chosen people and receives lots of help like food and medicine from sponsors; that's very rare for people in such a low district. Katniss makes her closest relationship with Peeta, and they survive by faking a love relationship with the audience. Katniss sounds her age when she's going through with this, very confused if she actually likes him or not. The ending has an amazing climax, and I'm not going to spoil it. I highly recommend checking out this book, it'll be a really quick and fun read!

0767817478|1.0|I really hate this movie! As a huge Gojira fan, I felt VERY disappointed. Not only that, but as a film in general, it's almost completely, terrible...the script, the acting\dialogue, characters, creature design...the special effects (while not great) are probably the only good thing.<br /><br />First off, Roland Emmerich\Dean Devlin (Independence Day) turned down the offer to direct the film a few times, simply because they had no interest\knowledge with the Godzilla franchise.<br /><br />They wanted re-tell the story, with a re-designed beast (by \\"Face Off's\\" Patrick Tatopalous), which is basically, a giant iguanna (as shown in the opening credits) and not a terrifying, powerful-mutated dinosaur.<br /><br />This \\"Godzilla In Name Only\\" (aka \\"GINO\\") barely resembles it's Japanese beast (besides the dorsal fins and re-sampled Godzilla roar). In fact, it runs away from the military and hides! And for some reason, it can't out-run a taxi cab! Not to mention, it uses \\"breath\\" for one sequence, but it's no radioactive. And...it's asexual and lays a bunch of eggs to which they hatch, giving way to a rip-off Velociraptor-like scene from Jurassic Park.<br /><br />I mentioned the acting\dialogue was crappy, right? Mathew Broderick, Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria, Maria Pitillo (cute, but annoying) and Jean Reno (yes, the \\"Professional\\" Jean Reno), to name a few, are all bad in their roles, but I blame the script\directing more, than the actors (but Maria and Mathew really hurt the film). Oh and there are two characters, based on Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, that were put into the film, as somekind of \\"payback\\" by Roland\Dean for the bad reviews of Independence Day (yet, the critics aren't killed by GINO).<br /><br />The script\story is just awful. I can't believe Tristar greenlighted this. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich should be ashamed and deserve all the negativity about this film. Its a disgrace to Toho, the Godzilla franchise and Godzilla fans.<br /><br />I'm hoping that Gareth Edwards and WB\Legendary Pictures will make a TRUE American Godzilla remake. \\"Monsters\\" was not very exciting, but at least Gareth has stated that he loves Godzilla movies and promises to make the \\"right\\" remake.<br /><br />BTW, watch \\"Godzilla: Final Wars\\" for a special, brief cameo by GINO : )
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive about this movie at first, thinking it was going to be retardedly campy.  This movie was really funny and its always a big plus when the hillbillies win in the end
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is written by Suzanne Collins and is a direct follow up to \\"The Hunger Games\\" and it's just as amazing as the first book with all of the same crazy twists and turns. Since Katniss and Peeta survived the Hunger Games through their \\"love\\", they have become quite popular and it is upsetting the Capitol. Katniss is really hating all the attention and just wants things to back to normal. This book is even more intense then the 1st one! Out of everything that happens, the most shocking thing that happens is the return of tributes for the 75th Hunger Games. The greatest thing about surviving The Hunger Games is not the money or fame, but not ever being picked or having family picked ever again. When reading this book, you simply can't believe this is happening and how unfair it is. Katniss also meets 2 runaways from previous districts and they claim that there is a District 13 and they go off to look for it. The first book had some great and torturous action scenes involving all of the fights, but this book makes the first fight seem like a CAKEWALK. The way that the arena works like a clock is a brilliant yet scary concept. The best part of the fight is when everyone teams up together, but everyone  is unsure who will end up killing each other. Again, Katniss is full of questions, but she sounds more mature as a person overall. I don't want to spoil to much of this book, but this is a book you simply can't read in more than one sitting; it has to be read all at once. It catches your attention more than anything, and I myself am not much of a reader, but I read this book in a matter of a few hours. I highly recommend giving this a read right after reading The Hunger Games.
B003EV6DBW|3.0|It seems I am outnumbered when I say I do not like Matt Smith's interpretation of Doctor Who.  It's not so bad that I won't watch the show, but I much prefer seasons 1-4.  I'm a recent Doctor Who convert and I'm loving the show in general, but with season 5 and 6 the attitude changed and I liked it better the other way.  Matt Smith plays the Doctor like an idiot savant, rather than a highly intelligent man acting a fool to disarm his opponents.  Amy is sometimes so stupid I want to strangle her.  The episodes themselves have lost something that I find hard to describe, but that was, it seemed to me, and integral part of what made Doctor Who what it was.  While it is interesting and fun to see ties between episodes now and then, this season is nothing but ties back and forth.  It plays more like a strange soap opera, which I really do not care for.  I am highly disappointed, but as I said, not to the point I will not watch the series.  It is still good, just not 5 star good any more.<br />As for the Blu-ray DVD, I always prefer them to the standard.  The picture quality is so incredibly clear and crisp, it sometimes almost seems to be 3-D, and with Doctor Who, that is a big plus.  The extras on DVD are pretty good also.

B004XJHBCE|1.0|I thought this would be the prefect app and of course the stock browser bookmarks should be more customizable and have folders. I also noticed this app said it's the only one that lets you view your customized bookmarks in their folders directly in the browser whereas other apps like this can only view in a widget on your home screen. after spending some time adding my many bookmarks into folders &amp; making it all prefect I went to the browser to see how it'd look and all of my bookmarks were gone. The folders were there but you couldn't do anything with them &amp; when trying to open the folder it just opened a error generated webpage. Of course I didn't have my bookmarks backed up for some reason I didn't think of backing them up. I would love to have folders and customizable bookmarks in my stock browser like dolphin but I still can't find a solution for what seems to be something that should come that way.

B000GGOCIE|5.0|Marion Bradley's The Mists of Avalon is a sensitive and perceptive version of the King Arthur legend viewed from the feminine perspective. Bradley has recreated the traditional King Arthur story without changing the fundamental mythology and generally she has reinforced the pagan aspects of the medieval world that many Arthurian books have lost.<br /><br />In her Arthurian saga, Bradley decentres such Arthurian commonplaces as Christianity and chivalry; she reinterprets her heroine Morgaine as a vision of female power rather than an evil manipulator; and in the person of Guenwhyfar she shows how women lost power in Western culture. Marion Bradley's explores some 20th century feminist themes that would not have been accepted in the 18th and 19th century such as women owning property and having a significant influence on religion and courtly matters.<br /><br />The Mists of Avalon begins with the Kings of England fighting the insurgence of Saxon's invading in the south and the Crowning of Uther as High King of England. Taliesin the Merlin of England and Viviene the Lady of the Lake plot and scheme to insure the blood line of Avalon is secured on the Thorn of England. Arthur is their chosen King and his sister Morgaine plays an instrumental role in maintaining this blood line. Even though she is without full understanding of how integral and deep this influence runs within her, Morgaine is determined to uphold the pagan Goddess's wishes and save Avalon from being lost forever.<br /><br />The book is narrated by many different women within this story, each presenting their different perspectives on religion, politics and courtly lifestyle. There is romance and hatred with the cunning and wickedness that only a woman could write. There is nothing lacking in this story based on the legend of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. It is truly original and exciting from cover to cover. I highly recommend this to anyone how loves medieval literature.

0385344228|5.0|The author makes it so easy to put yourself in the narrator's place and made me wonder how well I know my 15 year old son too.  This book spoke volumes to me as a parent in today's world of Facebook and the Internet and how things can be put out there and taken the wrong way also.  I read the Kindle edition in one day; my eyes are sore and gritty, but this book will linger on in my mind for a while to come.  A good read, hard to put down.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|If you are a fan of King's writing, you'll enjoy this book. It does a great job of making you feel like you are actually in another time with Jake aka George.<br /><br />On a technical side, I want to mention that if you do  not own an Ipad or Iphone, DO NOT PURCHASE THE ENHANCED EBOOK WITH AUDIO/VIDEO!<br /><br />I did so, thinking that because I owned a Kindle Fire, which fully supports audio/video and is also an Amazon product like the ebook, that I would be able to enjoy the 13 minute video made specially for the book. After talking to technical support however, I learned that you can only watch the video if you have an Ipad or Iphone. Again, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me and I suppose it must be a licensing issue or something, but there should maybe be a little more disclaiming involved seeing as how I paid a higher price for this feature.<br /><br />I would even be ok with Amazon emailing me a special link to watch the video at the very least. I'm interested in what other historical information or opinion that King has on the subject.<br /><br />Other than that issue, however, the book was enjoyable and along the lines of what I've come to expect having read The Stand, It, The Dark Tower Series and more by King.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Unbelievable that this book has ANY 5 star reviews. The writing style is extremely immature;  it's too kiddie for adults and too adult for kiddies. And wow. This is NOT erotica. This is a book about a very damaged man and a woman who thinks that she has to put up with his bizarre, infantile behavior because he is so HOT and if he wasn't damaged, he would have never looked at her. Luckily for her, she resembles his crack whore mother. Master is dark? No, Master should not be allowed to have a relationship with any woman until he gets his crap straightened out. Not sexy.  Holy Cow! Inner Goddess! Smirking! Laters! Same sex scene over and over! Tripe! Don't pay for it. I didn't and am glad it only cost me the time I read it and deleted it.

0439023513|2.0|(spoiler alert) Seriously?  OK Let me start by saying that I loved the first book!  The second, although a little repetitive with the Hunger Games again, is still worth reading.  The third book is really hard to put into words.  The characters we love from the first two books disappear almost completely and the reader is left with shells of them.  Like there is no life or fight left in them.  By the end it becomes(I agree with other readers) too adult for younger readers and even depressing.  Peeta is tortured no longer the boy we all fell in love with.  Katniss is pretty much nuts and incredibly selfish.  Running from her problems or hiding in closets rather than helping Peeta.  The war at the end is long and drug out and even confusing at times. (is it real or in Katniss' mind...etc)  How did her sister really die? At the hand of the Capitol, or the very people she is working with?  I mean seriously.  The end is even more frustrating as she goes from hiding in closets and whimpering to a life with the man she chooses. I read the other reviews and hoped for the best.  I wish I could say the bad reviews were wrong, but this book was tough to get through.  I really hope the movies are better!
0345803485|1.0|So many people told me this was a fantastic book, so I bought it. Next time, I'll not trust those people and I'll read some reviews first. The writing style is simplistic and slightly boring. The story is silly and I guess you really can't fix stupid since there are two more of these books in print. And now I hear that a movie is in the works. Don't waste your time.

B004SUWR2C|5.0|This has served us well!  My  4 year old loves playing it, as do my husband and I.  However, it did the most good while we were stuck in a small car with 4 kids (ages 11, 6, 4 and 4) during a severe storm for over an hour!!  We folded down the seats, passed out chips and the kids played UNO.  Later that same week, I was in a \\"lock-down\\" with seven 6th graders.  I had my kindle with me.  I handed it to them, they teamed up and played for a good deal of time.  It runs beautifully, there are no glitches, and kids of all ages love it!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about, maybe I am reading a different book. By the tone of the narrator I wasn't sure if I was in England or in the States. I couldn't get past the first two pages. Boring and juvenile.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I like it because its simple yet a good game to play when your bored ogle have no sense of urgency to do anything
B005K17RU0|5.0|Thoroug, quick and complete.  Great UI and rash to use.  I have downloaded the app to use on my Kindle Fire and so far have no problems.  I would recommend the product!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Pros:<br />Keeps my Core 2 Extreme Quad QX6850 very cool. 32C idle. 43C load.<br />Fits on an ASUS Striker Extreme (NVidia 680i chipset) motherboard just fine.<br />Rated very highly by Maximum PC<br />Brilliant design - works on many CPU sockets, this means I can take the cooler with me when/if I update to an i5/i7.<br />Great value for the price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />You will have to take the motherboard off to install this one. For me this meant that I had to take apart my entire machine. A bit more work, but worth it. Not an issue if you are buying this for a new build.<br />The pictures in the instructions were pretty bad, the result was the cooler took a little more time to install.<br />Would be nice if they bundled this with some arctic silver 5.
B000X107GI|5.0|Had no issues. seems like a good product that is priced in line with others on the market. If your lookin for a place to access lots of different types of these type of batteries then you,ll find what you need here i believe

1609611543|5.0|Insightful, authoritative, and convincing. This is a must read for anyone who wants to switch to a balanced diet with positive short and long term effects. It provides a sound argument against modern wheat, backed up by scientific evidence, and a wealth of ideas for a diet free of problematic carbs. Whether your goal is weight loss or simply regaining your health, this book will show you how to achieve your goal in a sustainable manner. After reading this book and consulting my family, we agreed to eliminate wheat from our diet, and we're already better for it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game is a ton of fun and works great on my HTC sensation! I don't like the crushing levels as much as the stacking ones, but they are definitely all fun!
1595827684|5.0|Quality concept art and character at on the inside.  Given that it is hardback and has thick pages, it's a great value for your money.
1401937519|5.0|I downloaded the Kindle version few hours ago after reading many of the uplifting reviews here. I did watch a video about her several months ago and was most touched by her experience. I have already read most of the book.<br /><br />Whatever your views on life after death, what if her experience is one we will share when we leave our bodies?<br /><br />What if that angry, jealous vindictive, judgmental god we might so fear is a human concoction rather a truth? What if we are the true judges of our lives to our own detriment? How does self hatred and judgment assist anyone anywhere? If we truly love ourselves, our world would be a much more peaceful place to live.<br /><br />True love does not mean self-indulgence. That comes from feeling not-enough.<br /><br />Read this book with a mind open to possibilities.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was drawn in by the buzz about this book -- first mistake. Since the book deals with a topic about which little has been written in the public eye, I should have been more wary.<br />The first few pages cast doubts but I plunged ahead. Being a very persistent person, I almost never abandon a book once started -- second mistake. My interest in the subject matter kept me reading page after page after repetitive page, hoping that the awkward, immature and naive writing style was intentionally being used temporarily as a vehicle to convey the state of the protagonist. Ever the optimist, I thought that surely it would soon morph into at least a literary moth if not butterfly. Unfortunately, that was not to be.<br />Readers, if you have developed standards of quality regarding the art of writing, don't make my mistakes. Beware, and read the other negative reviews. This is possibly the most poorly crafted book I've ever read.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|this game is awesome at first until you put your time and effort into it and then it freezes up and resets all of your crops and buildings. my crops had 1 hour to harvest then the game froze and now my crops will harvest in 111 hours!  If I would have had to pay for this game I would have given it 1 star but since it was free I'll give it 2!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  It started out with a freebie.  I had to have more.  They kept me captivated until the end.  For those that are bothered by cursing, there is virtually none until around the end of the third if I remember correctly and a few in the fourth and fifth.  It can be hard to get some good sci-fi books without many curse words.  Get this one, you won't be sorry!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I spend more time playing this than I should  :)  It's so much fun to play. Great app! I love it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I give this free app five stars. I love the features. You can specify days of the week and have several alarms set at different times on different days of the week. People whose schedules vary will find this feature invaluable. You literally can set your weekly alarms and forget them. The app remembers and notifies you which alarm is set to go off next and why.<br /><br />Another feature I love is the different choices for disabling the alarm and  setting the snooze function. I use the \\"solve math problems\\" disabling method. Since I hate numbers this selection is guaranteed to get me out of bed every time. For those who love to wake up, you could select the \\"shake\\" function for disabling. I feel this app is totally versatile and definetly recommend it.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Works fantastically! This app is fast, simple, and free, what's not to love? Those who dissed it because they use something else should be ignored. I love not having to mess around with cables and the fact that you can easily transfer between android, apple, an windows makes this a winner.
