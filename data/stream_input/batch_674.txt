0307341542|5.0|I have a hard time believing that this is a first novel.  I simply could not put it down and insisted that my sister (who was visiting)take it with her for the ride home.  She called as soon as she finished, not yet home, still in the car.  I did not expect the ending nor the amount of intricate misdirection! <br /> <br />Definitely a harsh read but captivating all the same.  I look forward to Gillian Flynn's next novel
B000NA1OXY|5.0|I'm in love with this album!! Its Avril's best by far! <br /> <br />Best songs: <br />Girlfriend <br />Runaway <br />The Best Damn Thing <br />Everything Back But You <br />Keep Holding On
B00003CXTG|1.0|At least Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer are consistent. Their \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is a visually arresting monster with attractive leads, formulaic plotting, cartoonish characterizations, and jingoistic appeals to our patriotism that are about as subtle as a giant American flag flying over a Perkins Pancake House.<br /><br />When it was released in 2001, I had hoped that Bay-Bruckheimer would at least attempt to make this their \\"Titanic\\" -- a full-body workout for the special-effects guys that somehow also tells a good story. But this movie remains as flat and numbing as ever. It certainly shows every dollar of its titanic budget, but unlike James Cameron's film, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" does not transcend its origins. It was made to do one thing very well: haul in 13-year-olds' allowance money. (Consider the triage scene at the naval hospital, where shots of agony and gore were blurred in post-production so the movie could get its coveted PG-13.)<br /><br />Given the relative skill of its actors and its colossal production values, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" could have been a fine movie in the hands of a more imaginative director and a more courageous producer. But Bay and Bruckheimer deliver the lowest common denominator of summertime fluff. If you want the stark reality of combat, see \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" If you want a love triangle in the midst of war, see \\"Enemy At The Gates.\\" And if you absolutely HAVE to see a Pearl Harbor love story, watch the only decent one ever made: \\"From Here To Eternity.\\"
B0006VIE4C|5.0|You had to be there to understand how profoundly different, how mesmerizing this film was when it was first released. As teenagers, my friends and I, living on the white trash side of town and with limited familial resources for much other than lunch money, had to shop lift our SF books. We stole them in great numbers, actually. I'm not proud of the fact, but our little SF club needed material to read and discuss, our basement library needed to grow, and our nascent writing talents needed role models. The genre was our life. Imagine the two remaining members of that thieving little club some years later, who, still addicted to SF, walked into the largest theater on the south side of Detroit, sat down without much of a clue what to expect, and watched that fantastic yellow roll-up against a field of real-looking stars, followed by that, that, that bone rattling sound and the sight of the very first Imperial cruiser rumbling overhead. My friend Mark actually had tears in his eyes at the close of the film. It was singularly fantastic. I'm feeling like the geeky kid I was then by reminiscing like this, but this film had a profound effect on me.<br /><br />Mine is not the only generation in love with the series. My son, years later became a rabid Star Wars fan and amassed one of the largest collections of Star Wars stuff I've ever heard of, he even has some of the huge theater lobby cardboard stand-ups. I'm not sure where I'm going with this except to say that this film changed it all. It catapulted SF right out of the gutter and into the mainstream. It brought to cinematic life all the sights and sounds of distant worlds and characters that until then had existed only in our science fiction heads. It made at least one of us cry from the sheer joy of seeing it. It is a timeless wonder and real cinematic magic.
1932100660|5.0|Elegantly performed experimental evidence of how diet and nutrition impacts one's health. I am a predoctoral student in the biomedical sciences and have always had a strong interest in nutrition as I have been able to silence my rheumtatoid arthiritis by simply changing to a vegetarian (mostly raw) diet. Of course as a scientist, I always want to know mmore regarding how this result occurs on a mechanistic level and some answers based on convincing studies are provided in this book. Nutrition is simply fascinating and I am saddened that such convincing data is not discussed with as much excitement and gene-disease link data that may sport less physiological relevance. All in all, information that all should add to their knowledge of nutrition in order to make informed decisions regarding health and put to use as they see fit.
B000F1IQNM|2.0|When you know the plot of the movie before you see it, they'd better do good things with the characters.  But here, they don't.<br /><br />Strange-looking Nanny McPhee has to teach the kids to be good and get the hero married before the nasty Aunt Adelaide cuts off the family allowance, and--what was that?  Before the allowance is cut off?<br /><br />I'm amazed that this movie has done so well. In America, land of the self-made person, you'd think a goal of getting someone else to pay for your way of life would be, at the least, unappealing.  Even in Victorian times, you didn't HAVE to produce 7 children you couldn't feed. And then, maybe if Brown (Colin Firth's character) had fewer children, or a smaller house, or did away with one or two of the household staff, his salary at the morgue would have been sufficient. (He works at the morgue. Ha. Ha.)<br /><br />Since the powerful and good Nanny is so strange-looking, I thought this might be a movie about inner beauty, but no. As the children learn Nanny's 5 lessons, she gets less ugly, until at the end she is lovely Emma Thompson. This reflects their inner change, or maybe it just means that ugly is bad, after all.<br /><br />There are some great things about this film, such as the surreal sets which tell us not to take anything seriously, or the normally lovely and classy Celia Imrie as a vulgar strumpet.  (Just as there's no person as horrid as a good one gone bad, there's somehow no better \\"bad girl\\" than a naturally classy one.)<br /><br />The ultimate change in Mary Poppins--despite her magical powers-- occurred when Mr. Banks himself realized he had to prioritize his family. Colin Firth never has any kind of personality change, and any change that happens comes from someone else doing a rescue: Nanny McPhee, Aunt Adelaide, or the oldest son. If I can't root for the main character, why would I want to watch?<br /><br />Not a lot of laughs, confusing and conflicting messages, not anything I want to see again.e again.
B0000640VO|5.0|Its French, she's cute, and its the untimate feel good film.<br /><br />This is the film for those evenings in either alone or with a partner.  It has everything a French film should have, the coffee house, the beauty of Paris, that wonderful eccentricity of European cinema and most of all a happy ending where love conquers all.  Why oh why did Audrey Tatou take the role in Da Vinci Code???<br /><br />When you have finnished with this buy L'appartement you wont regret it.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I picked this up prior to a ten hour road trip.  I played this cd the entire time.  After 7 hours of listening I was ready to write this off as an average effort, with nothing memorable or remarkable about the music.  But then I took a break by the side of the road.  I kept the cd on as I sat outside and rested.  It was then that I had a chance to really listen to the music.  It was amazing.  For those who are giving this average reviews, give this a chance.  Sit down and commit to listening.  This is not In Absentia, it's not Deadwing, but it is a great, great disc in its own right.  The music is subtle and nuanced, and requires some focus to figure out what's going on.  The theme of this cd is very interesting and it holds together from beginning to end.  Whether you are a PT fan or not, give this a few spins and you will discover how brilliant this is.
0743270754|5.0|Normally, a history of this length would take me months to get through, but Team of Rivals was a quick read. Goodwin excels at telling compelling stories and getting inside the skin of her subjects. In this volume, she deftly reveals the human side of Lincoln so that you cringe at his corniness, laugh at his self-deprecations, enjoy his evenings chatting with friends, cry for his misfortunes, and applaud his political skill. Her ingenious tack - to place him in context with his rivals who became advisors - brings new perspective to a well-researched historical icon.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Through most of the movie I kept thing that this had to be one incredibly boring book this author was writing.  For the movie, the plot was about a character becoming aware of it's creator and trying to change the predestined course of his life-none of that was going into the author's \\"book\\".  The ending is truely a toss up.  It's either clever or a cop out.  I think it's a little bit of both.  Still an entertaining film.
9626344059|5.0|Murakami's novel follows the fate of two unconventional characters. The first is called Kafka Tamura. He undertakes to run away from home on his fifteenth birthday, travel to a remote place and spend some time living in a library. His project turns out to be successful and so he finds himself at the Komura Library in Takamatsu where he meets Oshima and the enigmatic Miss Saeki. <br />The other character is an older man called Nakata, a master cat-finder who is able to converse with cats although he can neither read nor write. <br />Both Kafka and Nakata find their way to Takamatsu although they never meet. During their wanderings they meet all kinds of characters, some of them have a surrealistic nature. Indeed quite a few scenes have a dream-like quality because they are not rational. It is as if the reader were reading a sort of stream-of-consciousness but its form is fully structured unlike similar passages found in James Joyce or Virginia Wolf. It is a tale of quest which is highly inventive with cats conversing with people, fish raining from the sky and soldiers rambling in a forest, un-aged since the second World War... The superb reading for Naxos Audiobooks is done by Sean Barrett and Oliver Le Sueur. A fantastic performance. <br />
B000002I25|5.0|Some have accused your favorite Seer of being shamanistic. This view is not without merit. But, I did not get my abilites from a dying indian on the roadside. No. I was not that fortunate. It happened at a roulette table in Vegas.  But, as my guides will testify, it was totally by accident. I do, sometimes, go camping and stay in a teepee. But, that is where all similarities end.<br /><br />I have no choice but to look at this album in retrospect and try to explain why the Doors were so monumental in their age. Certainly, they had a very unique sound and, aside from the expected pleading and exhortation to lure assorted females, there was also the underpinnings of dread and death hidden and not so hidden within the lyrics.<br /><br />This is not to say that Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore did not contribute their craftsmanship to the sound. In fact, they were far superior in that respect to many at the time. They provided the landscape, the moods, the nuances that were so essential to match the poetry of Jim Morrison. The sound was so different at the time. They could be concise with great rythmns and major riffs, but, in large part, they were masters of the long jam. And I hate to call it a jam per se.  I prefer the phrase of musical excursions. But, whatever you deem it to be, it is as mystical and alluring as smoke rings from a fire at an indian encampment.<br /><br />Alot of why this sounds so good, even today, is owed to their great producer, Paul A. Rothchild. I had the good fortune to meet him one time. A short man with wire rim glasses and a pony tale. He then ran off before I had a chance to really gather alot of information about Morrison. But, I did manage to get the story that after a big New York concert, Jim bit his hands til they bled. This is perfectly understandable if you analyze his lyrics, which can be quite revealing.<br /><br />But, I digress. The Doors is an amazing debut album in it's own right. It starts with \\"Break On Through (to the other side)\\" and I see Jim's dilemma of being between dark and light and the need, somehow, to escape his position. Death? Well, maybe. But there definitely is a dark side in many of his phrases. Take \\"Crystal Ship\\" for example. \\"The days are bright-but filled with pain\\", and it is his hope that he is delivered from it.  Sex was such an important part of his personality. I think, to him, sex and death became synonymous with total release. It was the death of the soul, melting into another soul, and entering some sort of transcendence. Far-fetched? Maybe. But one of the great lines, from \\"Light My Fire\\" is \\"and our love will be a funereal pyre\\". Now, I must tell you that not too many people knew what a pyre was. Yet, he incorporated that into popular culture. It's like him to emulate love to a funereal pyre. Isn't death a defining theme in his life? Many think so.<br /><br />The album is sprinkled with some really great songs. The bar room rousing of \\"Alabama Song\\", the rock sway pop of \\"Soul Kitchen\\" and \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\". Masterful and concise. And let's not forget the blues grit of \\"Back Door Man\\". How appropriate. Jim certainly did know that the little girls understand.<br /><br />But, however uplifting these compositions may be, Morrison's poetry inevitably gives him away. \\"End of the Night\\" could be a yearning for the end of his nightmare. The song itself is slow and laboured, revealing a tiredness and heavy burden. Some are born to the endless night.<br /><br />We then come to the end of the album with the fitting song \\"The End\\". I am always fascinated by this song. I feel like it's the backdrop to an opium den somewhere,  But more than that, it's a bird eye's view into his mind. We are treated to Jim's tortured Freudian psychology. But, it also conveys stream-of-conciousness to his netherworld. \\"Weird Scenes inside the Goldmine\\", \\"Ride the Snake\\", \\"the West is the Best\\" etc. etc. We are all caught on a ride of interesting emotions. All the Doors lure us in onthis one, and you can't help but ride the blue bus with them.<br /><br />As evidenced with this album, and the ones that followed, I think it was only a matter of time until Jim imploded. But, in answer to why they were so monumental lies in the quality of their music and Morrison's monsterously creative torture. He was a deadly time bomb waiting to explode, but on the way to that point, he put all his universal force that was within him to give. He was totally unique and the constant seeker to the answer of the universe. There will never be another Morrison.<br /><br />In closing, a true classic and essential for anyone's rock collection.<br /><br />I must go now. My fragile egg-shelled mind is starting to hurt. Oh well.<br /><br />Ride the King's Highway---your confounding but dubious Metamorphoide the blue bus with them. <br />As evidenced with this album, and the ones that followed, I think it was only a matter of time until Jim imploded.

B0001I55OC|2.0|This is actually 2 reviews blended as one; the first, the movie as a standalone film (disregarding the book), and the second, as an adaptation of the book.<br /><br />THE MOVIE:<br />The movie was not very good. It moves quickly and is filled with action but suddenly dies half way through and grinds to a slow finish. They don't really take time to explain much, rather they press forward with the story and unsuccessfully try to allow the characters to explain important points as the film runs it's course.<br /><br />The story is creative and could be exciting. Archaeologists go back in time to the place they had been excavating. The man who is sponsoring the archaeological dig is a bad guy, someone seeking to make money off of the scientific find of the ages, time travel, even if it costs a few lives.<br />The acting is OK, the direction is OK, the editing OK, the screenplay is horrible, and the costumes, landscapes, sets and period pieces are somewhat authentic although stylistic and cliche.  The battle scenes are poorly choreographed and not exciting.  The only thing of note that was accurate would be the siege engines.  That was done well.<br /><br />All-in-all, the movie is poor. It is an OK escape, a film that may be worth watching but which does little to add to the genre of action/adventure films. A below average outing.<br /><br />THE MOVIE AS AN ADAPTATION OF THE BOOK:<br />This is where the movie really falls flat.<br /><br />If you read the book, don't expect much from the movie. Everything is changed. Characters, their motivations and fears, reasoning and abilities, strengths and weaknesses, relationships and interactions with each other, are all changed from the minute the film begins. A few good characters are completely dropped and several others are significantly changed from the book. The best character from the book, Andre Marek (played by Gerard Butler) is uninteresting at best.<br /><br />The plot, the scientific explanations of time travel (which the movie just explains was an accident), the historical figures, the confrontations and protagonists, are all different and lack the depth and richness they possessed in the book.  This was a pathetic attempt at adapting a book to film.<br /><br />The book, as usually is the case, was much better than the movie. I can accept that. The basic premise of the book is carried over; that is to say that \\"based upon the novel by Michael Crichton\\" is an accurate while also misleading description.  This movie just does not maintain any similarity to the book aside from the basic premise. It was very disappointing.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the book and felt that it could have been better adapted. I don't know if Crichton (the writer of the book) was involved in the movie, but if this were an adaption of a book that I had written, I would be very unhappy with the hack job that Hollywood did on a novel that was well researched, well written and thick with character development, historical accuracy and suspense.<br /><br />MY RATING:<br />So, to sum up; if you are looking for an adventure, set in medieval times, this may suffice as mindless entertainment.  As a standalone film, disregarding the book, the movie is a 2 or 3 out of 5, if I am generous<br /><br />As an adaptation of the book, I would give this a 1 out of 5, very poorly done and extremely disappointing compared to a very good book.<br /><br />So, I arrive at an average rating of 2. Had I not read the book, I may have rated the film a 3, but that is a bit generous because the movie just doesn't hold up as an entertaining adventure.  Sorry.l figures, the confrontations and protagonists, are all different and lack the depth and richness they possessed in the book.  This was a pathetic attempt at adapting a book to film.

1401302378|5.0|This is an interesting book dealing with the long tail (the bell curve normal distribution, at the ends are the long tail), especially through the net.<br /><br />Yah i believe that my kids watch less TV (hooked by YouTUBE), and there are hundreds of TV channel now. Even that the Long Tail Effects are not as strong here in Indonesia compare to in USA, there are tendency of this thing happening day by day.<br /><br />Book lovers have just set up a BOOK LOVERS CLUB in Jakarta (Indonesia) and this is the first book to be discussed there! Very interesting idea, huh? ;-).<br /><br />So, be careful with the long tails, things have changed, and there are less and less MAJOR SUCCESS, everything will be more and more devided among the infinite choices available.<br /><br />Have funs reading and contemplating and thinking about HOW IT WILL AFFECT YOUR BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE? Take care and enjoy.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I literally just finished watching this movie and I have to say that it was amazing.  It was so powerful and touching and really made you connect with the characters and the stories.  Yes there is sex but it doesn't seem dirty and this is definitely NOT a porno type movie. <br /> <br />The sex is real and adds to the story.  I was so moved by some of the characters.  In particular I really liked Severin and the guy who almost killed himself (forget his name) but who didn't want to leave his lover alone - I found the video tribute and his feelings to be very powerful. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.  It's fantastic.
1400063515|5.0|Added on 11 August 2007:<br /><br />The book is still pretty and interesting at second read. I reread the book for doing a local review (for SWA - Famous Indonesian Business Magazine), and feel elevated again. I think i even grasp something more and enjoy it very much.<br /><br />I come to think that most of things really do happen with some high portion of randomness. And the Black Swan is something that always happen even at the very small probablility.<br /><br />Books often available a bit late at this part of the earth, except Harry Potter 7, haha so, I always review books that are somewhat a bit old ( give a couple of months before good selling books are imported).<br /><br />This book is not easy to read, and does need some concentration. It has one big concept, the Black Swan, but has plenty of small anecdotal stories that wrap well around the whole narative.<br /><br />If this kind of book makes the New York Time Bestseller list for quiet a while, it is definitely worth reading. Yah, BTW Nassim's success in wrinting is a Black Swan by itself.<br /><br />=======================================<br />Original review:<br /><br />The long awaited book after the Fooled by Randomness finally arrived at my lap (this is Surabaya, Indonesia) brought by DHL, such a happy moment. I have been afraid that the second book will not be as attractive as the former, but I m wrong! This one has a better NARRATIVE ;-), and still contain so much information and thoughts that often force you to put the book doen and think.<br /><br />Fooled by Randomness is a Black Swan, so does The Black Swan, things  Highly Improbable, a rare event, highly sellable book that is highly intelectual as well. The book contains Hume, Popper, Plato, Kahneman and Tversky, combined with Nassim own story and life. All deliciously weaved into a readable fabric that will glue you to your seat (or bed! In mycase) for days.<br /><br />There are three type of books: The How To book, the book that will show you how to do something, The Motivational book aka Self Help, and books that \\"Change The Way You See Things\\", a perspective change book, such as this one. Books that make you rethink your own perspective and change the way you see life.<br /><br />With strange chapter title like \\"Umberto Eco's Antilibrary\\" (How to seek validation) to \\"Living in the Antechamber of Hope\\", you got a chockfull of delicious stuffs, in a sense like \\"Bitter Sweet Chocolate\\" ( and NOT Milk Chocolate), which for certain type of people will be the ultimate delicious read.<br /><br />A warning: this is not an easy read in the usual term, although that this is an easier read compare to Fooled By Randomness and I predict that this book will go to the \\"best selling\\" fame and glory. You have to digest and think to get the full impact. For easier read, you can read \\"The Halo Effect\\" (finished in a day) which is also a great book with similar line of thought.<br /><br />I thank Nassim for such an enjoyable reading week ( I read fast, yet it took a week, to finish this) which has sharpen my mind and see life in a more \\"correct\\" way.

B00005JNS0|5.0|Definitely a keeper!<br /> A fun filled Family Movie with a powerful message about friendship, ego, & teamwork... This is a nice movie, appropriate for all ages - no glarring issues that would be of concern to even the most conservative parent... Of course there will be those that deconstruct the movie from the outside in - basing their comments on the \\"realness\\" of the movie - for example: the lack of people in the movie makes it unrealistic b/c the cars couldn't build the race tracks, buildings, etc... well yes that's true - but cars also can't talk or have relationships or go out tractor tipping either ... this isn't a movie based in reality... it's just a laugh out loud, very cute movie, with wonderful animation - The whole family enjoyed this movie. So grab some popcorn, pile up with your family & enjoy this one! (It's nice to have movies that you can pop into the dvd player, sit back & relax without being concerned about what may or may not appear on the screen...)
B000M3452Y|5.0|LCD Soundsystem had somehow escaped my attention until I read a review in Rolling Stone Magazine not too long ago. Everything they said  pointed to me liking this CD. Sure enough, I ordered it and I love it! It's catchy, melodic, beat heavy and hook laden. In places it has strange electronic sounds and gimmicks that play with your ears and your mind. It has wonderful vocals and multi-layered harmonies, including an utterly charming female background vocalist that wails and yelps a few additions to a couple of the tracks. James Murphy and company presents a wonderful array of danceable electronica music. In listening, I'd say it is very modern and unique but it also has a retro feel. In places, it sounds somewhat like a friendly battle between Devo and Talking Heads, two of the quirkiest bands of the New Wave era.<br /><br />All the tracks are quite good and it would be difficult to rank them. My favorite track, however, is \\"North American Scum.\\" Somehow it has a very amateurish sound, but it's playful, happy and uplifting at the same time. It's a wonderful combination and the vocals are especially good on this track. If I had to somehow pick the weakest track, ironically it would be \\"Sound of Silver,\\" the song that provides the title to the album. One song that really stands out as atypical of the entire album is the melancholy  \\"New York, I love You but You're Bringing Me Down.\\" It's a great song and, strangely enough, provides a wonderful close to the album.<br /><br />Altogether, this CD provides catchy, quirky and uplifting dance  music. It's fun. When I listen, I have a smile on my face. That's my kinda music.
B00005JPAO|2.0|This movie was okay.  Ive seen better movies on the royal family on television.
B000IU3Y3W|4.0|Neil Young has been having a pretty good run these past few years.  First, in the shadow of a medical crisis, Young created PRAIRE WINDS--one of the finest records he ever made and a more fitting companion to HARVEST than the otherwise excellent HARVEST MOON.  M.S. then put together a good film of Young and his friends performing and the Ryman in Nashville.  (This comes from someone who rarely cares for music videos.)  These accomplishments were then followed by the dreadful LIVING WITH WAR.<br /><br />Whether you share Young's passion or politics, LIVING WITH WAR had all the artistic grace of a political commercial one week before an election.  Yes, album was the critics darling and it ended up on several *best album lists* for 2006; but the whole album has none of the power and cogency of Young's 1970 single *Ohio*.  The artist is perfectly entitled to act as Young the pamphleteer.  Nonetheless there is little of interest that will draw new listeners in the future.<br /><br />2006, however, also saw a brighter highlight with this release from Young's massive archives.  Like much of the folklore surrounding him, these recordings are so behind the scenes, so personal, so promised and hopes unfilled that fans and critics alike have began to suspect they would have to await Young's demise before these recordings would be released to the public at large.  Therefore, Young faced the prospect that the *real thing* could not measure up to expectations.<br /><br />First, we have to get the negative out of the way.  The DVD is a complete disappointment.  I thought we were going to be treated so some archival video footage.  What we get is a series of about a dozen black and white photographs looped to the same audio tracts found on the CD.  Who actually thought this would make anyone happy?  These photographs can be found from several available sources.  Less than zero points here.<br /><br />Like many, I also have a bootleg copy of same live performance.  Sonically LIVE AT THE FILLMORE EAST is vastly superior.  Bootlegs tend to be clear as mud--especially those from the early 1970's.  Unlike others, I do not complain about the missing songs that can be found on the unauthorized releases.  In all likelihood, we will see these missing performances one day.  More significantly, the improved clarity and definition really are that important.<br /><br />By design or accident, this particular selection of songs draws one to focus on the interplay between Young and Crazy Horse.  Aside from the odd love/hate musical relationship with Steven Stills, Young has had few partnerships as powerful as that he had with Danny Whitten.  It was Young's great misfortune that Whitten would die of an overdose soon after these performances.  Young would go on to create HARVEST.  He would gather for himself a short lived household name; but he blamed himself for Whitten's death.  This resulted in a depression he would endure for much of the rest of the 1970's.<br /><br />*Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere* is a striking beginning to this electric set.  Originally a minor but important song from the album of the same name, it has been translated well into a lively reinvention.  To my ears, it has a similar arrangement style that would be found on HARVEST.<br /><br />*Winterlong * has never been a favorite of mine.  The lyrics are something of a dud with no emotional resonance.  The power interpretation here does little to make it better.<br /><br />*Wonderin'* is a better song in a goofy sort of way.  Not great; but fun.  Strangely, it would be given a rockabilly treatment on 1982's EVERYBODIES ROCKIN'.<br /><br />*Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown* is a jaunty song that I am ambivalent about.  Given its subtext of searching for a heroin fix, there is much to hate about it.  This song would resurface on Young's most difficult album TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT as a centerpiece.  On TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT it would have more power in context of the rest album than it does here.The best thing about it here is Young's introduction of the members of the band.<br /><br />The cream of this recording belongs to both *Down By The River* and *Cowgirl In The Sand*.  Several hours of close listening and enjoyment are found on these two cuts alone.  The intense interplay between Young and Whitten as they fire walk across their respective fletboards creates a musical wind shear in front of the bass and drums.  We don't hear extensive guitar soloing much like this in our time.  This kind of instrumental display in a traditional rock setting began with Cream about 1968 and tapered off around 1975--perhaps because that particular vein had been all mined out or because a newer rock audience sought something else.  It was an oddity of its time that began with the British blues revival and ended with the passing of Southern/Country rock.  Depending on your sensibilities, either you mourn its absence or relieved one doesn't have to endure one more guitar solo before you get to the good stuff.<br /><br />Be that as it may, this recording finds Young at the dawn of the 1970's with the future of rock before him and the rock \\"kinship\\" at its most communal.  In some ways he was at the peek of his creative powers and stood as a pioneer to what was to come.  Young has been regarded these days as proto-punk and the godfather to grunge.  These would be nice compliments if it wasn't for the fact that both punk and grunge could be found in their infancy in the garage bands in the 1960's.  Never mind...another subject...another day.  If your musical christening began with Nirvana or (God forbid!) Justin Timberland, you owe it to yourself take a bite from this feast.  There really was a time when the battle cry of \\"sex, drugs and rock and roll\\" actually meant something more than sex, drugs, and rock and roll.album than it does here.

0451188470|3.0|While I don't particularly relate to the main characters of this book, it was a fun read.  I picked it up for a week long \\"recuperation\\" and after day two, had to find something else to read.  I couldn't put it down.
074325144X|3.0|What this book lacks in sophisticated, scientific presentation & execution, it makes up for with optimism and good nature.  The author's good will and enthusiasm for running as an activity for people of all ages & fitness levels, is apparent throughout.  Most experienced runners might not garner too much new information from this basic book, but it does have plenty of friendly reminders about form, technique and style and it's all presented in an extremely likeable fashion.<br /><br />As a multimarathoner, I did come away with a few good tips and \\"food for thought,\\" so it was certainly worth the time spent reading.  I think, though, that it would be of greatest benefit with the companion DVD or a live class, for introducing newer runners to safe sporting.
B00005JPD0|5.0|I really enjoyed this thriller, it is always exciting when a movie is written that can take you through it with all of the grace of the great classics,  without using all the very unintelligent swearing. Really shows that the people behind the movie, are leaps ahead of those that feel they have to follow along like a herd of sheep and swear needlessly to make a point. These that made this film are of a higher line of thinking. Thank you so much, well done, and enormously enjoyed!!
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I have absolutely no experience with childbirth, but I do know the presenter, Erin O'Brien, to be one of the most knowledgable, friendly and talented instructors on the Los Angeles fitness scene.  This is also a beautifully produced DVD that is quite evidently a safe and effective program for expectant parents.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Never give up hope, great message. Heart felt. The acting was very natural.  Made feel the yearning of wanting to provide better for his family. Great message in saying I am willing to work hard for that success, but my family comes first. Great support through out the film.  Thank you for not using fowl language!!  That is so rare, and so very appreciated.  I can recommend it to my friends and family, who are many, without feeling they will be offended, and that is a great feeling too.  Thank you, very very good.
B000K9L32U|4.0|Move aside Westlife, Justin Timberlake, and Backstreet Boys.    The greatest boy band of our time Take That have returned with a big bang.    Beautiful World is That's 4th studio recorded album, not counting the compilations. It's a nice collection of mellowed-down ballads along with some foot-stompers and crowd-pleasers.     The Manchester boys have grown up. It's been 10 years since the time Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Howard Donald, and Jason Orange announced that they were parting ways -Robbie Williams ditched the band months earlier and ended up being the most successful of them all, he does not return to the lineup this time around (it's his loss really). The overall feel and sound of World reflects the boys' maturity and self assurance. It also symbolizes the first time the boys share songwriting duties: Gary Barlow isn't the sole writer, Mark, Howard, and Jason all are credited; Jason debuts as a lead singer on the fantastic album closer Wooden Boat.    The album opens up with the breathtaking Reach Out, a beautiful ballad and future single, that reminds us why we loved Take That in the first place. The UK Number 1 singles Patience and Shine are simply awesome, the latter written and sung with conviction by Mark is probably one of the best pop songs I've heard in a long time, while the former is sung by Gary with such an infectious passion; Patience is technically Gary's first hit single in about a decade. Mark's Shine is the most upbeat song on the album with a beat that is similar to ELO's Mr. Blue Sky, with Beatlesque harmonies and an incredible chorus; the music video to Shine includes references to The Beatles' Your Mother Should Know video. Howard's radio friendly self-reflective Mancunian Way, a potential single, is a cool song that will eventually grow on you after a couple of listens. Gary's lovely ballad Ain't No Sense In Love, another potential single, and the first group effort I'd Wait For Life produce a nostalgic sense of how great it was being a fan of Take That in the 90's. Mark's What You Believe In is an elusive bluesy pop-rock number. Finally, Jason Orange's breakthrough Wooden Boat is a country influenced acoustic number (Jason actually has learned to play guitar and write songs over the 10 years that passed), and turns out to be one of the highlights on World. There's also a bonus track that appears shorty after Boat fades out titled Butterfly, a sweet catchy ballad written by Gary.    Beautiful World might not be as great as Everything Changes or Nobody Else, and Take That might not be as young and exciting as they were once. The album does lack the typical Take That dance and upbeat tracks along with the piano-driven ballads that made past efforts much more balanced. However, their return with this album deserves a very warm welcome. I'm sure the fans will agree!    So I will end by saying: Take That, welcome back...and hopefully, for good this time!

0374105235|5.0|An amazingly good first book from a boy in his 20s, who became a man in his early teens. An eye opening and gruesome account of a brief period in the long violent history of Sierra Leone, told by the author, who became a conscripted soldier in order to survive at the age of 11 after his family, along with most of his village, had been brutally killed by rebels. By 15 he was a drug addicted killer and a correspondingly excellent soldier, according to the standards in effect. His painful rehabilitation after being rescued by the UN is a testimony to the difficulty of all soldiers when returning to normal life. Interesting lessons in Sierra Leone culture and more lessons on why war is insane - emphasized when seen from the eyes of a child. The happy ending after his his eventual but difficult move to New York was only hinted at, and mentioned in the acknowledgments, but not fully developed. I guess it is not necessary for the story, but by that time we were certainly hoping for a happy ending, and for me the ending was too abrupt. I hope, however, that this at least means we will be seeing more books from the remarkable Mr. Beah.

B000GCFO0I|3.0|<br />I won't be dumping this one in my neighbor's yard-sale bin like I will my copy of the unrated version of The Hills Have Eyes. I say this because I don't like misogynistic horror films, which are too prevalent now, and the Hills Have Eyes has an unnecessary and offensive scene to women in my opinion.  No, I'm not necessarily a feminist.  I just know what I'm seeing and I don't enjoy that in my scary movies!  Silent Hill had enough for me to get past the totally misogynistic barbed wire in the ** scene.  It at least has cool CGI creatures, intelligent plot, decent acting, very creepy atmosphere and a fitting musical score. <br /> <br />And that's why I'm keeping this one!..;-) <br />
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Aidin Vaziri - why are Amazon paying this opinionated bigot? <br /> <br />Just because Incubus are taking a turn towards your taste does not mean the earlier work was wrong or poor. <br /> <br />In fact they would not be around today and making music more to your liking if people like me hadn't bought and enjoyed their previous albums with the angst and slap bass you seem to abhor. <br /> <br />I think they were great and are great, but shy from dogmatic comments like those of Aidin Vaziri, Amazon review author. Slap bass and angst still have a place in music, it is not 'dated' as he said, and there is nothing bad about nu-metal. If you happen not to like it, then don't listen to it. <br /> <br />The irony is that there would be less angst if it wasn't for such intolerance in the world. <br /> <br />Karl
B000MGBSI0|5.0|This is were being nice stops...and the real tacky,raunchy,back-stabbing,two-facing,selfish behavior kicks in.Heather Lockear's character \\"Amanda\\" really made this show,with her no-hold bars antics with co-workers,employees and her tenants.Melrose Place made Falcon Crest,Knots Landing look mild.You definately would have to put this series in the family with Dynasty where Heather started out and Dallas. <br />Nothing but a dysfunctional group of people all under one apartment complex....can't get no better than that!!!
B000N6TX1I|3.0|I found this film to be fairly good - However, I was really impressed with the short (blink and you will miss it)yet powerful visual nod to Pink Floyd....In the film, Theo goes to meet with whom I believe to be his brother (?) in order to ask him to secure transport papers for the pregnant woman...Theo's brother seems to be rather affluent - Over his shoulder, out the window in the distance you can clearly make out the iconic Battersea Power Station. And if you look closely, you can see an inflatable pig floating....This of course replcates the album cover of \\"Animals\\",released in 1977, Pink Floyd's follow up to \\"Wish You Were Here\\"
B000001ES9|5.0|Just because the debut album from Rush is more like a straight forward hard rock album, it doesn't mean the album is bad.  This was the beginning stages of Rush, and everyone knows the very first album is always going to be different from the rest, especially when it comes to 70's rock.  That's just how it was back then. <br /> <br />\\"Working Man\\" is a very heavy song with lots of guitar soloing, making the song even better, in my opinion.  The surprise highlight is \\"Take a Friend\\" with wonderful vocals from Geddy Lee.  Sure, his voice isn't always enjoyable, and I admit, sometimes it's hard to take, but he does a fine job overall, and the guitar playing is great if you're a big fan of hard rock in general.
B000M341QE|2.0|This movie lacks in cohesion and cinematic poetry compared to the original \\"Infernal Affairs\\" movie. The music score for the background effect is unparralled in the original. Although casted w/ remarkable, renowned actors, the Departed characters just didn't mix and match well and \\"departed\\" themselves from dramatic flavor that defines and balances the whole movie. For example, Dicaprio (good mole) and Sheen (his boss) just didn't connect throughout the whole movie. The interaction w/ gang members and police force members seemed dry and disattached. See the original and its bonus feature and you'll know what I'm talking about. As in any good guy, bad guy cop movie or mob movie, there's suppose to be a sense of brotherhood and family in the gang/mob and even in a police unit. Isn't a sense of brotherhood and belonging one of the attraction to Gangs? Granted, there's betrayal or a mole, but that's always the case anyway for great drama. And come on, these are Irish mobs we're dealing w/, there's a reason for St. Patrick's (or I'm proud to be Irish) Day. Family, struggle, and the Church are bonded like DNA. The Asian original is similar, Buddhist outlook, family, honor, and brotherhood. Perhaps I'm missing something Scorcese was trying to deliver in his cinematic style. Asians love American flicks, we'll see how this movie does over there, and if they've seen the original, this one just might be deported.
B000M5AJQS|2.0|Like many of us, I'm in awe of Martin Scorsese's talent. There is no doubt that he is one of the world's premier story tellers and I'm a huge fan.  He'd already won the Academy award for Best Director before I saw the film and even though I hadn't seen it, I thought it was well-deserved and long overdue praise. Needless to say, when I saw it listed as a film choice, while on an international flight, I was elated. Imagine my disappointment when I realized this star-studded film was not one of Scorsese's best efforts, which is odd because the performances seemed on target, especially the Mark Walhberg character. I don't know if it was the editing or what, but this movie just didn't do it for me. It was too slow in places, some scenes were not sufficiently developed and other scenes seemed to use violence as a mask for their lack of development. And the ending was terrible! This was a huge departure from the guy who gave us films like The Aviator, Gangs of New York, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, etc. I don't think it's so bad that you shouldn't see it for yourself, after all it did win an Academy award, but, I think you will be disappointed.
6302842557|5.0|I played this over the course of several days for my batch of urban CA 6th graders. At first, I was concerned that these hiphoppers wouldn't even give it a chance, with its high-fallutin language and costumes, but they were intrigued with the Solieri character (we stopped often to discuss what was happening and why we should care), loved Wolfy's goofy laugh, irreverent attitude, and beautiful wife, and the music. That part they REALLY got, and pointed out if themes were repeated. It was a great experience that worked well with our unit is music.
B000286RKW|5.0|An unbelievable director, an unbelievable cast, an unbelievable story aided by unbelievable soundtrack makes an unbelievable movie!
B00005JMXX|3.0|There is nothing specific about this movie that is particularly bad.  The story line okay.  The acting is not necessarily Oscar material, but nonetheless is fair.  The special effects of the flooding and freezing of New York City is pretty spectacular. <br /> <br />My only quibble in terms of belivability is that in spite of cold temperatures there is no breath visible -- which given the amount of money that was spent on the special effects is an unacceptable oversight -- could have easily been done with digital post processing.
B00005JPGO|4.0|Years ago, I was shocked to find that the diamond industry was so ugly; as a result, I was anxious to see this movie. As I've said in other reviews, I don't believe it's fair to expect a movie to accurately address or solve pressing global issues. Movie making is a for profit business. The movie industry is however a powerful median; as such, has within its grasp, the power to raise public awareness. Blood Diamond was a gripping, exciting, emotional and engrossing movie from start to finish. Djimon Hounsou turns in a passionate performance as distraught father and forced laborer, Solomon Vandy and Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an interesting performance as military trained, ex-commando turned mercenary, Danny Archer. And contrary to some reviews, I thought Jennifer Connelly's portrayal as Maddy Bowen, a hungry upper middleclass, I don't mind getting dirty for a story journalist, was on target. In the end, 'Blood Diamond' delivers as a candid but entertaining story about yet another one of Africa's ugly little inhumane secrets.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|\\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" is the magnificent movie dramatization of the characters of Patrick O'Brian's Naval novels.<br /><br />Set in the Napoleonic Wars, the storyline is built around the pursuit by British Royal Navy Captain \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey and his ship, HMS Surprise, of the French warship \\"Acheron\\".  The pursuit begins with an encounter in the South Atlantic in which the smaller Surprise comes off second best but survives.  Aubrey decides to repair his ship at sea and pursue the Acheron around Cape Horn and into the South Pacific.  The ship and crew will enjoy a brief visit to the stunning Galapagos before returning to the hunt.  The climax of the movie is the second confrontation between the Surprise and the Acheron.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is pitch-perfect as Jack Aubrey, firm but fair master and commander.  Paul Bettany is equally perfect as the ship's doctor and the commander's best friend, who will try to mitigate the effects on the crew of Aubrey's obcessive pursuit of the Acheron halfway around the world.<br /><br />The movie is rich in period detail and provides a fascinating glimpse into life aboard a British warship, crewed by tough sailors and officered by a interesting collection of sometimes desperately young officers.  The sequences at sea, whether rounding the Horn in horrendous weather or boarding an enemy vessel, are thrilling and well-executed.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as a thrilling drama and as a glimpse into the British Royal Navy at what was arguably its peak as the best navy in the world.
B000JRYOPG|4.0|Loved it, Great movie..it shows the grimy hard life in Jamaica, not the white sand and pretty beaches.When they went to Miami it got much better too,I wish there was a soundtrack for it because I liked the music. Can't wait to see the sequeal!!
B000NA28IE|4.0|Sometimes it pays not to look at reviews, but rely on the word of mouth.  My sister recommended the movie to watch during my weekend movie marathon sessions.  I work hard during the week and I don't want movies that I have to think about. I want to be entertained. The child in me wants to see heroic tales of good knights battling the evil kings. Being too old to think of the hero as anything but a nice young man, the presence of such solid actors as Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, and Robert Carlyle thrilled me. I've watched it twice and am now buying the movie. I grew up on movies such as Snow White, Prince Valient and Ivanhoe. I am not a \\"purist\\", I love to be able to shed a tear or two, cheer for the good guys and leave the movie thinking, I'd watch that one again. Oh, before one gets the idea I'm not literate, once upon a time I read \\"Gone with the Wind\\" over 100 times and majored in History and English Lit. in college!
0307275639|5.0|I loved this book. I read it for my Ap English III class this year. It was so<br />amazing. I cried at the end of the book. I cannot imagine how this book racked up 109 one star I loved this book so much that I bought another one of his books called \\"For One More Day\\", but haven't gotten around to reading it yet. Many people have also recommended that I read the book \\"5 People You'll Meet In Heaven\\", which is supposedly amazing. So I definitely suggest you read this book and others by Albom.<br /><br />Thank you for your time,<br />Loran

B000LC55F2|5.0|\\"The Prestige\\", based on a novel by Christopher Priest, is a movie that surprised me. I had heard that some people liked it, and that some people hated it, but I didn't expect \\"The Prestige\\"  to be the kind of film that makes you  want to watch it again immediately, just to be certain you didn't miss anything. And that is exactly what happened in this case...<br /><br />This film, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a drama set in late 19th century London that has some ingredients that can only be described as fantasy. All the same, the spectator won't be able to shake off the feeling that what he is watching is real, due to the excellent way in which the actors, the director and the scriptwriters managed to bring Priest's novel to life.<br /><br />The title of this movie has to do with one of the three acts of which every outstanding magic trick consists. The first act is \\"The Pledge\\", when the magician shows you something seemingly ordinary. The second act is \\"The Turn\\", when the thing that seemed ordinary is turned into something extraordinary. The last act is \\"The Prestige\\", the act that crowns the magic trick and makes it unique. Magicians live and die for \\"The Prestige\\", and that act is somehow at the center of this story.<br /><br />The main characters in this film are two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), that due to a tragedy go from friendly rivals to fierce enemies. The quest of each one of them is to best the other, no matter the cost, notwithstanding the means. Who is the best magician, who can really achieve \\"The Prestige\\"? And will he live to boast about it?<br /><br />On the whole, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie, and that I would gladly watch it a third time. Highly recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000L22WTO|5.0|I'm willing to stand up for David Gilmour and for this charming and modest tribute to Syd Barrett.  Gilmour is one of the few people who can sing Syd's songs as well as Syd could (along with Robyn Hitchcock).  This EP is clearly a labor of love, not an attempt to cash in.  Gilmour is well beyond the point where he needs to do anything for money -- and he's also at a stage where loss of reputation would be devastating, so the risk is all his.  I loved this little EP just as I loved his In Concert DVD, which includes performances of Syd's \\"Terrapin\\" and a great, jazzy, shuffling, stunningly original reimagining of \\"Dominoes.\\"  Gilmour is the leading Syd Barrett interpreter and I hope he will offer us more inspired Syd covers.
0440238609|4.0|Phillip Pullman's \\"Dark Materials\\" triology are the kind of books that you simply must read if you are a science fiction fan, or if you just like well-written books... You don't have to be a teenager to enjoy them, but you need to have a big imagination in order to thoroughly enjoy them. If that is the case, go on reading this review...<br /><br />The \\"Dark Materials\\" triology takes place in a world similar to our own, that is at the same time very different. In that world, each person's soul can be seen, is called a \\"daemon\\" and takes the form of an animal. The daemons of children change their appearance constantly, but once the children become adults, their daemons choose only one form. Pullman's alternate world has other differences, too, for example the fact that it has different kinds of magic, and that witches and armored bears coexist with human beings. The result is that the world he builds is exotic, strange but at the same time familiar.<br /><br />On the negative side, the writer also plays with an institution we are familiar with, the Church, using its name but leaving behind its essence, in order to talk about a world ruled by tyrannical ecclesiastical authorities. I didn't like that, and probably you won't like it either, but keep in mind that this is a work of fiction, and as such, its purpose is to entertain, not to be taken seriously. All the same, if you think your sensibilities will be offended, or that you won't be able to separate reality from fiction, don't buy this book. You will be losing a lot, though.<br /><br />Regarding the plot of these books, the main character is an orphan girl named Lyra, that lives in the Jordan College of Oxford. Her life involves no more responsabilities than playing in the grounds (and roofs!) of the College, and making mischief with her friend Roger and her daemon, Pantalaimon. But all changes when Lyra hides in a closet and hears her uncle, Lord Asriel, talk about some weird things that are happening in the North Pole to some scholars. Lyra wants to go there with him, but is not allowed to do so. However, soon afterwards her dear friend Roger and many other children disappear, and when all clues point out to the North Pole, Lyra will start a journey to rescue them. That journey will take her to many places, allow her to meet lots of different people, and help her to discover new things about herself and others. If you want to share all that with Lyra and Pantalaimon, just read this book :)<br /><br />After reading \\"The Golden compass\\", I thought that the triology was promising. However, it was only when I finished the last book in the \\"Dark Materials\\" series that I realized why this triology has such a reputation as a masterpiece of science fiction. On the whole, I think that this box set is a treat teenagers and adults will enjoy, but I believe it may be too complicated and somber at times for young children. Provided you take that opinion and my previous comments into account, recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS: A film based on the first book of this triology is to be released in late 2007.

However, soon afterwards her dear friend Roger and many other children disappear, and when all clues point out to the North Pole, Lyra will start a journey to rescue them. That journey will take her to many places, allow her to meet lots of different people, and help her to discover new things about herself and others. If you want to share all that with Lyra and Pantalaimon, just read this book :)  <br /> <br />After reading \\"The Golden compass\\", I thought that the triology was promising. However, it was only when I finished the last book in the \\"Dark Materials\\" series that I realized why this triology has such a reputation as a masterpiece of science fiction. On the whole, I think that this box set is a treat teenagers and adults will enjoy, but I believe it may be too complicated and somber at times for young children. Provided you take that opinion and my previous comments into account, recommended...  <br /> <br />Belen Alcat <br /> <br />PS: A film based on the first book of this triology is to be released in late 2007.

B000GYI32M|4.0|Ok, was this season as great as seasons 1 or 4? No. Was it as a good as the pretty sweet season 2? Probably not. But this third season is so not as terrible as everyone says it is. I just got done rewatching it again and I found that I like it a lot more than I originally did. You still have Ryan, Seth, Summer, and Marissa. You get Taylor thrown into the mix, which is pretty fun to watch. The storylines are not as great as the first 2 seasons but thats mostly due to all the different writers and Josh Schwartz not writing as much as he used to. Honestly, the really \\"horrible\\" parts of this season were Charlotte and that the Johnny storyline lasted TOO long. Besides that, it is really quite good telivision. So if you liked seasons 1 and 2 of the O.C., check this one out. It won't blow you away but I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Definitely spend the extra bucks for the 2 disc set This set comes with a really cool bonus disc and a great digest sized comic compiled with some of the great comic book stories that inspired the writers on the film. The bonus features are great, but I'd have liked some of them to be a bit longer--such as the history of Batman featurette. Great documentary on the pre-production and stunts as well as the fight choreography. Unfortunately the only cast member they interview in any depth is Christian Bale (such a shame considering the enormously talented cast this film has) and NO director's commentary or any commentary for that matter. Personally I'd have loved a commentary with the cast and writers.  <br /> <br />As for the film: this is most certainly a film about Batman. Who he is, how he came to be, and why he believes what he believes. Basically this film is blissfully nothing like the last two Batman films starring Val Kilmer & George Clooney in the title roles. I loved how the relationship between Gordon & Batman grows over the course of the film and the explanation given for their friendship/partnership is pitch perfect. A very important character to the comic book universe is introduced (Lucius Fox) and Alfred is given new life and a more sardonic sense of humor by actor Michael Caine. I'm not sure why every single Batman flick has him revealing his secret identity to at least one person (a sad tradition started in the first Burton film), but at least here it's much more plausible. The only disappointing aspect of the film is that Batman's detective skills aren't really shown to exist let alone given a chance to shine. Hopefully that's something they'll rectify in the sequel. And hopefully that sequel will be made with the same talented cast and crew. I'd love to see a true Batman onscreen trilogy. It would be wonderful to see Batman start out at one place and have him end in another over the course of 3 films with the same actors in key roles. It seems to be what Raimi is doing with Spider-Man and what Singer almost did with The X-Men. I think the Batman character deserves to be handled with respect and a truly definitive cinematic saga shouldn't be too much for fanboys to hope for. If such a saga is to come, then this film is the perfect place for it to begin.
0765316978|4.0|Overall, I highly recommend this book.  I didn't like it as much as the previous books in the [[ASIN:0765315246 Old Man's War]] series, but I still thought it was a fine book.  The difference between this book and its predecessors is in the way the characters are portrayed.<br /><br />In the current novel, John Perry is no longer a soldier; that difference changes the entire tone compared to the previous books in the series. Likewise, Jane has become comfortable and happy with her life outside the military.  Not a bad thing, but it makes this book feel qualitatively different from the previous books. I'd say this novel is only tangentially \\"military science fiction\\", though there is plenty of military action. Overall, it's well crafted.<br /><br />If you appreciate wry humor in your Science Fiction, this is the novel for you.  John Scalzi is witty and imaginative and has crafted another fine story.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|This film holds a special place in my heart. It's really the film that got me into comic books and solidified Batman as my all-time favorite superhero. That being said I realized it was probably over a decade since I last watched this film. I've pretty much every line of this film memorized since I watched it so much as a kid, but whenever I talked about the film with friends it was always through those rose-colored glasses of nostalgia. After watching this new 2-disc DVD and the recent film Batma Begins I have to say Batman Begins is indeed a better film--but only slightly. Burton's Batman set a stylized reality for Batman on film, but Nolan's version gave Batman something Burton's lacked: plausibility. Now, some people may say plausibility has no business in a superhero film, but I disagree. I think the more realistic you can make the characters and their problems the more the audience will be able to connect with them and the story.<br /><br />What Burton's films lack in plausibility it makes up for in style. There are a few points in the film that don't hold up so well to the trained filmgoer's eye, honed on years of sophisticated CGI pampering since this films initial release in 1989. In case you forgot, BATMAN used all models and at least two scenes use obvious (and inexplicably unnecessary) cell animation. The Acme Chemical plant and Joker's chopper are the two most obvious and cheesy models used in the film, but the rest are gorgeous and nearly seamless. Plus the Batmobile scenes are breathtaking. The 1989 Batmobile has to be one of the coolest cars ever designed.<br /><br />And let's not forget performances. I absolutely love, love, love Jack Nicholson's Joker. It's classic. A lot of reviewers criticized it as over the top and hammy, but that's exactly what the Joker is! Keaton doesn't say much, but he doesn't have to: his eyes say it all. And Bassinger as Vicki Vale is just the right amount of scared and confused.<br /><br />The DVD extras on this new 2 disc edition are the best of all the Btaman DVDs I've seen. We get a new 3-part in-depth documentary with new interviews from all the key players (except for Keaton--they just use footage from an older interview) plus other great featurettes including one on the making of the Batmobile. An Tim Burton who usually gives yawn inspiring commentaries manages to be insightful and informative with his Batman commentary.ew 2 disc edition are the best of all the Btaman DVDs I've seen.

0618680004|2.0|I am disappointed because the author sets up several \\"straw men\\" that he easily knocks down and avoids deeper issues. Dawkins does not seem to distinguish between religion and the exploitation of religion, especially political disputes that are packaged as religious disputes. In fact, he claims the opposite, that ethnic strife is usually religious strife. He also lumps all religious attitudes together, people who believe in the literal truth of the Bible (or other religious texts) and those who think that such books have been written by people and should be read in their historical context and take from them only what is valid today.<br /><br />The best part of the book is Chapter 5, \\"The Roots of Religion\\" where he addresses the question of why religion is so widespread amongst humans. But that is only one tenth of the book and the rest seems to ignore that part.<br /><br />Dawkins explains the persistence of religious beliefs as a result of religious instruction and, in effect, \\"brainwashing\\" of children. However, there are beliefs that are not supported by any organized religion and are still widespread. A good example is the superstition about \\"evil eye.\\" It exists amongst Christians, Muslims, and Jews (in Europe and the Middle East) and it is not part of any of these religions. It also exists amongst Hindus in India. What maintains people's belief in the \\"evil eye\\"? Because this superstition has not been sponsored by any major religion or political ruler, the reason for its survival should provide hints about the human need for religion.<br /><br />Dawkins quotes selectively from the Bible to show that it does not teach morality. In doing so he ignores parts where religion has pioneered concepts of social justice. My favorite is from Leviticus 19.9-10: \\"When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap all the way to the edges of your field, or gather the gleanings of your harvest. You shall not pick your vineyard bare, or gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and the stranger ...\\"
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I don't know what took me so long to purchase this CD. Even after I saw her in a Live Concert performance, I still procrastinated. How can you not love her R&B/Jazz sultry sound? This CD Excellent! There just aren't enough adjectives to describe this music. If you're looking for HIP HOP, well you won't find it here. This is truly grown folks music. I was about to give up on good Soul/R&B music but along came Robin Thicke, Elliott Yamin and Corinne Bailey Rae. The only problem with today's Soul artist is they take much too long to release their music (Maxwell, Lauren Hill, Anita Baker, Sade etc). I truly hope Corinne Bailey Rae is here to stay because we really need artist like her. I haven't grown tired of this CD and try to recommend it to people who I know will appreciate her talent. <br /> <br />My Top \\"5 Star\\" Tracks: <br />1) Put Your Records On <br />2) Breathless <br />3) Like A Star <br />4) Butterfly <br />5) I'd Like to <br />....Oh heck, all of the tracks are excellent! <br />
B00006AW2G|5.0|The album has been reviewed for content excellently on these pages. I will only comment on this New Edition. <br />I have listened to this album since 1973, and have LP and CD. <br /> <br />Was it worth to buy this Remastered version? <br /> <br />Absolutely. I hear things in the mix that I'd never heard before (even with my older and well-abused ears!). <br /> <br />Same for Aftermath, and Beggars Banquet. There's a new freshness on these re-editions that is simply staggering. <br />Of course, only if you have listening equipment that can capture these details... But even on my old Quad and Heresy's the difference is amazing.
B00005JPAO|5.0|this movie shows how one woman, has to change how she was raised in thought and service to her own people, in the movie she goes through many different emotions, some she has never felt and some she was trained not to feel. in the long run she comes to terms, and does the right thing, and lets the world see that she has a heart. Phillip shows his pompus self absorbing self, i guess he doesnt remember why he is even there, and if it wasnt for the Queen, he would be in Greece, showing boating parties where to fish. the awards giving to the actor who portrays the Queen is well deserved. a must see
B00000JCOV|1.0|I don't understand why this album was Slipknot's most successful. I'm not one of those 80's people that can't get past those days, in fact I'm only 13. This band has written some good songs, but certainly nothing on here will ever be good. Slipknot hasn't found their talent yet. And why did \\"Wait and Bleed\\" get into the best metal songs on VH1 (Ranked #36 in the top 40). It certainly isn't the best song on here, and one of this band's weaker songs. Still, I'd rather Wait and Bleed than the fan favourite Eyeless, which I find even more annoying. I don't like any of this, it sounds like stupid noise that could be improved by a band made up of dinosaurs. I guess that says all. There is one good bit in this album, that being the guitar intro to Surfacing but as soon as the vocals break in the song turns into what it was meant to sound like.    (Sic), Spit it Out, Liberate, Diluted and Only One are some of the better songs but that doesn't make any of them good. In fact, Spit it Out and Liberate would be even worse if the choruses had been cut out. (Sic) starts out mediocre, but after about 1 minute slips. Diluted just doesn't do much and Only One is catchy at least.    The other tracks are totally awful, and the only redeeming thing is that they don't last long:    (Sic) 3:19  Eyeless 3:56  Wait and Bleed 2:27  Surfacing 3:37  Spit it Out 2:39  Tattered and Torn 2:53  Me Inside 2:39  Liberate 3:06  Prosthetics 4:58  No Life 2:47  Diluted 3:22  Only One 2:26  Scissors 8:22  Eeyore 2:16    Standout track: Surfacing (only because of the good guitar solo at the start)
B00005JPAO|5.0|This movie works on several levels.<br /><br />As a semi-documentary, it reminds us of the tumult, the emotions of that sad time.<br /><br />As a character study, it shows us sides of the royals we might never have glimpsed otherwise.  We see the stiffness of one prince, the caring of another, the entitlement felt by a queen mother, the insight of a prime minister.  And all of these are fresh to an American, removed from the daily exposure to royal watching.<br /><br />But, for me, The Queen works best as a study of how people, regardless of station or rank, react to change and the pressure it places on humans. The subject is handled with subtlety and grace, but it is the focus of the film.  There is food for thought here, a rarity in current movie making.<br /><br />Well done.

I love her and especially this CD and recommend it to anyone!

B000G7PMD2|5.0|This is the first Dream Theater record I ever heard and I couldn't believe how blown away I was with it.  I popped the first CD in the car and listened to the first 2 songs and couldn't believe the quality of music so I went back and listened to the first 2 songs again.  The same thing happened after I listened to 'Afterlife' (track 4) -- I went back to the beginning and listened to the first 4 songs again.  It took about a week before I even got to the second CD.  The second CD is the 41 minute epic tune, 'six degrees of inner turbulence.  A song about, well, the inner turbulence of life.  There is a spot around the 15 minute mark where I find it too dissonant, and there is an instrument in the orchestra that is flat, but this is a very weak criticism for a absolute work of art including the fantastic 'solitary shell' and powerful climax.  The find the 3rd CD ok but not anywhere near the first 2.  Octivarium takes too long to get going and 'Metropolis' starts out so promising but the wonderful keyboard riff that kicks off the song is drowned out in the dissonance.  The keys are great, the guitar playing is great, the percussion is great and the vocals are out of this world outstanding.  One of the top 3 live albums off all time on my list along with Iron Maiden's &#34;Live after Death&#34; and Rush's &#34;All the Worlds a Stage.&#34;
031286504X|5.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" (c. 1954) by Richard Matheson<br /><br />Richard Matheson was born February 20, 1926.  As of this writing (April 29, 2007) he's still alive.<br /><br />Two films have been based on \\"I Am Legend\\":  \\"The Last Man On Earth\\" (1964) starring Vincent Price as Dr. Robert Morgan (Robert Neville in the text) and \\"The Omega Man\\" (1971) starring Charlton Heston as Robert Neville.<br /><br />The plot puts protagonist Robert Neville as the last human to live in a world where all others have been metabolized into the living dead who feed on each other and hunt Robert Neville at the same time that Robert Neville hunts the undead to rid not only the earth, but his own memories, of a disease worse than death.<br /><br />Richard Matheson has a crisp writing style that doesn't sacrifice cadence or style to keep the pace moving.  Here is a little passage as Robert Neville mourns his wife:<br /><br />\\"His unkempt hair rustled on the pillow as he looked toward the clock.  Two in the morning.  Two days since he'd buried her.  Two eyes looking at the clock, two ears picking up the hum of its electric chronology, two lips pressed together, two hands lying on the bed.\\"<br /><br />Matheson's dialogue engages the reader adding punctuation and text formatting to believable language conveying tone that moves the characters' voices along.<br /><br />The action in \\"I Am Legend\\" is continuous and grounded.<br /><br />Matheson created the protagonist, Robert Neville, with bold strokes accented with visceral highlights.  For me, although Neville in text is physically different than either Charlton Heston or Vincent Price, both actors captured sides of Neville's character that I could recognize.  Charlton Heston was a good choice to embody Robert Neville's strong yet tense characterization, while Vincent Price did a fine job portraying the sentiments of a man who lost his wife, companion, and love of eleven years as well as a beloved child.  Robert Neville, to put it another way, is a man's man who appeals to women for the depth of his love and passion, tenderness and morality.<br /><br />This story appealed to me as a female; I know it appealed to my husband for its story line, characterization, and Matheson's ideas.  Robert Neville is a man in pain, cut off from life as it used to be good.  I sympathized with him as he tried, without success, to lose the suppressed grief and haunting world that had replaced the one we all take for granted but without cannot function.<br /><br />Matheson takes elements from history, folklore, the horror genre, religion, and human psychology and biology to weave legends and science together creating \\"I Am Legend.\\"  While the book's technology is dated, and the story was written more than half a century ago, I can't help but wonder if within its scant 174 pages is a story that will engage readers for many years down the road.  Is my age speaking about things past that I enjoyed?  Or, as I think more likely, is \\"I Am Legend\\" a story that continues to be adaptable for current and future audiences?<br /><br />I'd like to think the latter. With a wink of research, I learned that Will Smith is cast as Dr. Robert Neville for a December 2007 release of a film titled \\"I Am Legend\\" directed by Francis Lawrence who directed \\"Constantine\\" (2005).

B00005CDUE|5.0|Before I bought this CD tonight, all that I knew from Roxy Music was from the Avalon album and the song \\"Love is the Drug\\". I bought the album Avalon because of the title track, and loved it, but I didn't know where to go from there. So I decided to pick up this CD as sort of a sampler - a way to direct myself through the Roxy Music discography. I haven't picked up any of the other albums yet, but I haven't been able to put down this CD so far tonight. I am listening to it as a type this.  <br /> <br />I can tell that my love affair with Roxy Music has begun, and it won't stop until I have more. But until then, this sampler is thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying, at least for the time being. It is HIGHLY recommended for those that are thinking about getting into the band.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This was the first Josh Groban album that I bought.  I heard his Live at the Greek album in a friend's vehicle and decided I needed some of his work.  I have since bought all of his available albums.  This is still probably my favorite.  It is an excellent example of his talent and the music is beautiful!  I definitely recommend it to any music fan.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|If you liked Avril's previous CDs then this won't be a disapointment. The album has a fast tempo for the most part but it all the songs are great especially the balads wow.  A lot of people think that Avril's music is diferent now and its true only becuase these songs aren't like here previouse albums but the AVRIL STYLE IS STILL INTACT so if you are a \\"regular\\" avril fan, you will be able to enjoy this album just as much as the others.  But if you are a huge Avril fan then you will definetly think that this really is \\"The Best Damn Thing\\"
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I really enjoy this BBC series. The footages are unique. The content, and image quality is excellent (if you don't try to compare the image quality with movie like Corpse Bride). One minor shortage: the disc case doesn't seem to hold the discs well.
B000J6I0PM|3.0|just got this dvd and love it. but was dissapointed when I found out that the uk version came with the hyde park concert. not that big of a deal since it's on aol video but would of loved to had that too. I love the intro to this dvd I saw it on danny clinch's site and that made me want this and it's great. I also wondered that if it was filmed in HD why it wasn't released on blu ray or something? that would have been cool but has great picture too. If you like this band buy this dvd.
006085880X|4.0|I find the extreme reviews on this story interesting. This is my first Picoult story so I have no frame of reference in comparing it to her other works. I really liked this book, and when I received it and saw the note that it is the basis for a Lifetime Movie I thought, \\"oh, great.\\" (And not in a good way!) But I found storyline compelling and felt that Picoult did a good job of getting inside the minds of the teenagers. It doesn't matter that we don't totally understand Emily's reasoning. Isn't that so true in life? How many teenager's lives are really so bad they need to kill themselves? Yet it happens all the time. They ARE melodramatic (or can be, anyway). I found the love story between the kids a little unbelievable but then again, from a teenage viewpoint I think it makes more sense than from that of an adult. Obviously Picoult left a lot of the development of their relationship up to the reader, with just a few key moments spelled out. I do think she could have added a bit more detail and left some of the extraneous character development out (some of which was weak or simply unnecessary).  Given the way the story was crafted, I can accept that Chris chose to handle the issue on his own, although I agree with reviewers who say that it's hard to believe he wouldn't tell someone that the girl he loved was in such trouble. I also want to add that I found the courtroom scenes well done and unlike other reviewers, could believe the verdict (I'll not go into more resoning so as not to spoil the story). I certainly liked this enough that I'll consider reading more of Picoult's work.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I admit that this album is a little different than his previous, but I would definitely say the talent is still very evident.  The music is a little different in the style, but his voice is still as incomparable as ever.  In any language, on almost any kind of song, Josh Groban's talent shines through and makes the different music types flow well on this CD.  All in all, I love all of his work thus far and would recommend it to anyone who likes his previous work.
B000000OQF|5.0|I still remember the first time I heard \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" on the radio.  It immediately caught my attention as something completely different and very cool.  To this day when I hear those opening guitar chords and Axle's opening scream in a sports arena (where it is played more than ever today) it still makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand on edge.  The cool thing is that the rest of the album was also very very good.  In the sea of bands that came out of L.A. in the 80's, Guns and Roses had that indefinable something that set them apart from the rest of the lot.  They were a band of street punks that hit their peak right off the bat with this album and unfortunately had no where to go but down after this.  This album is angry, nasty, grungy, metallic, and sleazy in all it's glory.  Yes, the language is explicit, and the lyrics are at times derogatory towards women, but the material is still, in some ways, what rock n roll is all about.  The music is consistently great, with Slash, Stradlin, Adler, and McCagen meshing perfectly as a unit to induce what they were trying to accomplish.  As a vocalist Axle Rose is the perfect foil to the rest of the band.  Whether you can stand him as a person or not there is no doubt that he was the perfect vocalist for this particular band.  Several huge hits came from the album including \\"Jungle\\", \\"Paradise City\\", and \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", but most of the rest of the tracks on the disc are just as strong.  Axle's snarl belts out rock classics like \\"Nightrain\\", \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", \\"My Michelle\\", \\"It's So Easy\\", and \\"Rocket Queen\\".  To this day this remains one of the best albums in my collection to crank up after you have had a bad day.  All of the angst and vile contained within, set to a perfect musical soundtrack; will never fail to cheer me up.  \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" would prove to be one of the most important rock albums of the 80's and remains one of the best debut albums by any band anywhere in my opinion.
B000002KKS|5.0|Arguably Sabath's best album. It's musically brilliant, driven by inspired playing from all 3 band members that seems to have been supressed under the voice of Ozzy. With the addition of Ronnie James Dio, a creative explosion took place, and Black Sabbath recorded what is very well their best album. <br /> <br />It sounds like Black Sabbath, with Iommi's distinctive style of guitar, Geezer Butler's thrumming bass, and Bill Ward's increasingly skillful druming. But there is a new sound to the band, faster and more creative, filled with emotion and a desire to cast off the shadow of Ozzy Osbourne, without whom many thought the band could not go on. <br /> <br />Heaven and Hell is an underrated album that is very worth recognition. Sabbath's peak, buy it.  <br /> <br />Neon Knights - A speedy rocker with a totally new sound for the band, driven by Dio's roaring vocals. Iommi's solo is upbeat and explosive, inspiried, far from what was heard of him in the past.  <br /> <br />Children Of The Sea - A slower song with a beautiful vocal by Dio.  A catchy bass line with gently flowing acoustics, another inspired solo from Iommi, and Ward's drumming sounds beter than ever. <br /> <br />Lady Evil - Words cannot do this song justice. When I first heard this, I was so shocked that I had to listen to it again...and again. It's still hard for me to believe that this is a Sabbath tune, simply because it blows away EVERYTHING that came before and after, with the possible exception of the title cut. Some call \\"Iron Man\\" Sabbath's anthem, but those who would look beyond the band with Ozzy will find the Lady Evil. Dio's vocal again is incerdible, driven by Iommi's soaring rythm guitar. It's explosive bass, upbeat and spacy drums, and thunderous guitar showcase what the band was capable of. Lady Evil features a brilliance before unseen by Black Sabbath. Arguably the highlight of their career, and Tony Iommi at his best. The album is worth double its price for this song alone. <br /> <br/>Heaven and Hell - A metal anthem of exceedingly high quality. Comparable to Rainbow's \\"Stargazer\\" in its epic sound. Bill Ward finds his wings, showcasing a skill behind the drumkit previously unheard. Iommi plays furiously behind Dio's majestic vocal, offering one of the best examples of his ability as a guitarist in his career. This song is charged with emotion. It may very well give you goose bumps. <br /> <br />Wishing Well - Unusual for Black Sabbath, and in fact it almost sounds like Rainbow. Excellent song. <br /> <br />Die Young - Anohter excellent song, with a keyboard opening that reminds me of Peter Gabriel/Robert Fripp's song \\"Exposure.\\" Fast paced and skillfuly slowed in the middle with a beautiful vocal. Furious guitar. And a lasting message as well. Very Impressive. <br /> <br />Walk Away - Almost poppy. But driven by excellent playing. Unusual, but very good in its own right. <br /> <br />Lonely Is The World - Complimented by a slow and haunting guitar lead that sticks in your head. An excellent end to the album, and one of the best songs on it. It makes you yearn for more of this material. The follow up album the Mob Rules in 1981 is not as good as this, but its definately worth buying as well. <br /> <br />

6307122390|5.0|\\"How can these heavenly creatures be real?\\" asks one of the characters in of \\"Heavenly Creatures,\\" the exquisite and horrifying docudrama of a shocking, real-life murder. Famed director Peter Jackson uses spectacular special effects and great actors to show us how these heavenly creatures became monsters.<br /><br />In 1952, Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) is a loner at her proper New Zealand school, until the day Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) arrives -- an intelligent, witty, daring girl who appeals to Pauline. Soon the two of them are nearly inseparable; even Juliet's four month stint in the hospital doesn't separate the girls through their letters and shared fantasies.<br /><br />But soon their parents becomes concerned that their close friendship is \\"unhealthy.\\" It is, just not in the way he thinks. The two girls' emotional attachment has turned incredibly intense: they barely think of anyone but each other, and the fantasy stories begin to seep into reality. Now Juliet is being sent to South Africa, and there is no telling when she will see Pauline again. Unless they do something about their parents so that they can stay together... such as murder.<br /><br />Peter Jackson starts the movie by emphasizing what a beautiful, peaceful country (via a cheesy 1950s documentary) New Zealand is. But beauty is not everything -- fairy tales can become nightmares. Jackson doesn't just show the audience what the two girls did, but showed why they did it. Even then, he doesn't make excuses.<br /><br />At first the movie seems almost whimsical, with fairy tale figures coming to life, beautiful woodlands, and hillsides transforming into blooming gardens. Nobody except Peter Jackson could have pulled off the idea of including living clay figurines or four-foot-wide butterflies. Somehow it not only works, but adds to the surreality of the story.<br /><br />But as the girls go deeper into infatuated madness, Jackson warps the whimsical world around them. Settings get darker and more distorted, and the line between fantasy and reality is completely wiped out. The scripting keeps that creepiness going (\\"Our main idea for the day was to murder Mother\\"), as do Richard Taylor's handling of CGI and prosthetics. (How DID they do the zoom through a sand castle?)<br /><br />But the movie really centers around Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet, and these two carry the movie beautifully. Lynskey can switch in an instant from sullenness to smiles, naive girl to murderous woman. And the luminous Kate Winslet plays the somewhat devil-may-care Juliet, whose vivacity and charm overrule any of Pauline's reservations. \\"It's everyone else who's bonkers!\\" she says gleefully when Pauline casts doubt on her own sanity.<br /><br />The most terrifying horror is the real kind -- the kind that is in the human heart. With its brilliant direction and equally good acting, \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" is destined to be a modern classic.t darker and more distorted, and the line between fantasy and reality is completely wiped out.

Hollywood is just the hole this particular peg was destined for.<br /><br />More's the pity, since Stardust lives SO vividly on the page!<br /><br />Hurry, snatch this one up, set aside an evening before August 10th and sink yourself lovingly into the land of Faerie, where ships navigate the skies fishing for lightning bolts, where witches live as both ageless reflections and bitter concoctions, where a small Victorian British town sits not only on the brink of modernity but between how things are and all the things they could never be.<br /><br />The movie might end up being good, but it is certain not to be as good as what you'll see in the spaces between these pages.<br /><br />BUY STARDUST!
B000MV8ABS|5.0|It goes without saying that Don Coscarelli's original Phantasm still has that cerebral effect on the viewer that few horror films can have.  Watching it now only solidifies the fact that Phantasm is undoubtedly one of the best horror films to come out of the late 70's.  Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury star as brothers who inadvertantly come across the demonic practices of a mysterious mortician dubbed the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), and the terrifying happenings that begin to follow them after their discovery.  For those who haven't seen any of the four Phantasm films, I won't divulge any more storywise, but I will say that this movie manages to pack in enough surprises, shocks, and metaphor that you'll marvel at how this film isn't always mentioned in the same breath as many other iconic horror features.  Despite the three sequels that would follow, all of which crafted by Coscarelli (Bubba Ho-Tep) as well, the original Phantasm still remains the very best.  Thanks to Anchor Bay, Phantasm lives on DVD once again as the celebrated DVD publisher of classic and cult horror films packs this single disc with an assortment of extras.  There is a great commentary track from Coscarelli, Baldwin, Thornbury, and Scrimm; as well as a half hour long documentary, and a bombardment of deleted scenes, as well as trailers for this film and Phantasm III (which was released on DVD by Anchor Bay at the same time as this edition), which only begs to question when Phantasm II will see the light of day on DVD again.  All in all, saying that the original Phantasm is a must own for horror buffs is saying it lightly.
B00008BXJG|5.0|AC/DC: One of the only true and dedicated Rock \\"n\\" Roll bands that have been making dependable and honest, in-your-face music for the past 30 years or so. Without a doubt, Angus, Malcolm, Cliff, Phil, and Bon (the line-up on Highway to Hell) are some of the most humble, comical, and nicest fellas anyone has ever known, and ever will know, for that matter. And without failure, the group continues to give their fans (with or without Bon [rest in peace]) predictable and unwavering classics, while maintaining that special freshness of genuinity that most bands can not boast about. Easy, but infectious riffs, funky-primin' drumming, and simple bass lines have never sounded so good, nor so enticing on this gem. Full of instant goodies, prime-steak riffage, and abrasive n crude vocals from one of thee greatest frontmen of all time, H2H is a sure-fire hit with anyone into good old fashion rock n roll. Anyone who says AC/DC sound the same on every album, are slaves to routine, or scared to move on got just don't know what they're saying. Taking the famous line from Rock n Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, \\"rock n roll ain't no rhythm man; to me it makes good, good sense\\" those critics of AC/DC have to take to heart what Brian professes on that number. With all that off my chest, here's the cannon for this Top 3 delight.<br /><br />Highway to Hell: Seriously now, how much more classic can you get? You're just socially inept if u haven't even heard of this song. Right off the bat, your ears pleasured as Ang rips out that catchy and infectious 3-chord riff that's so well-known today. Da-Da-Da. Da-Da-Da. Da-Da-Da--Da-Da-Da-Da--DaDa. Complete with Bon's coarse vocals and that powerful sing-along chorus, \\"highway to hell\\" is like a fiery shot 'o liquor, potent but tasty.<br /><br />Girls Got Rhythm: Just what you'd expect in a great AC/DC tune; contagious riff, Bon's bad-boy lyrics, and another catchy-as-heck chorus, with gang-vocals to boot. Ah, girls got rhythm indeed.<br /><br />Walk All Over You: Slow, but menacing opening riff, with powerful drums by Phil, that rips into a fast-paced rock n roll onslaught. Driving start/stop riff during the verses complementing Bon's vintage vocals, that goes back to the opening riff with a slow, but powerful chorus, again complete with gang-vocals. Also contains one of my favorite solos by Ang on here; fiery and scorching like lighting, just the way I like 'em.<br /><br />Touch Too Much: Opens with great complentary riffing by Ang and Mal, both producing riffs that kind of flow over each other. Kinda bluesy w/ AC/DC's leery lyrics plastered throughout the mix. Ang, once again, shreds on his frets, giving the listener a short n sweet, juicy solo. Chorus could be my favorite off the album as well, as Bon really hits those high notes, and 'cause the gang-vocals add a lot to this number.<br /><br />Beating Around the Bush: Probably the fastest song off the album, this treat delivers galloping riffing and drums plus some great filler solos in-between the start/stop riff. Features some stellar screamin' from Scott in addition.<br /><br />Shot Down in Flames: Bon gets center-stage here, not being backed by Mal and Cliff and all, plus painting the perfect picture of getting s*** on by a snobby chick. Ang, however, takes the show with his speaker-splitting solo that speaks more than volumes.<br /><br />Get it Hot: More laid back and relaxed, but nonetheless still enjoyable. Fun, little rocker, that adds yet another gem to the track listing.<br /><br />If You Want Blood (You Got It): Yes, Yes, give me it ALL! This perfect compliment to Highway to Hell could be AC/DC's most sinister number describing hypocrisy and unfair treatment, while managing to throw in a curse word for good measure. The ending is the highlight, though showcasing Bon + gang vocals at their finest, preceded by Ang's great solo.<br /><br />Love Hungry Man: The drums are the best on this stripped-down, blues-bust. While the worst off the album, it still acts as an enjoyment.<br /><br />Night Prowler: What a great way to end this masterpiece. Bluesy, but no less rocking than any other track here. Ang's beginning, cresending solo acts as a nice opener to Bon's subtle and quiet vox. Then, all of a sudden, the heavy guitar riff rips out and Bon screams out 'night prowler' with Mal and Cliff giving their best back-up performance off the album. Perfect closure.<br /><br />>In closing, just pick this up RIGHT NOW! No, in fact, if you don't own a copy, just forget it, cause you should have it by now (he, he, ehh). Highway to Hell was a great way to close off 70's AC/DC, Bon's career (RIP once again), and their first era, which produced several classics, not just this.

B000AP04MO|5.0|1967 marked the end of Audrey Hepburn's continuous reign as a major film star. After this her cinema appearances would be sporadic and in vehicles of uneven quality. She certainly went out with a bang, giving two topnotch performances in films that year, of which \\"Two for the Road\\" is one (\\"Wait Until Dark\\" is the other).<br /><br />The lush photography of the French countryside and equally lush score by Henry Mancini link this film with other glossy Hepburn vehicles such as \\"Charade,\\" but Stanley Donen's film of a Frederic Raphael screenplay is a surprisingly acerbic and unsparing take on marriage. Mark Wallace (Albert Finney), an architect, and his wife Joanna (Hepburn) arrive in France, called to a project by his demanding boss. Their twelve-year union is obviously not in the best of shape, and as they travel toward their destination scenes from previous journeys they have taken together as a couple are intercut in alternately amusing, ironic and poignant flashbacks. The fluid time structure of the film remains remarkably fresh, and Hepburn rises to the demands of playing a woman at multiple ages and stages of life with ease, giving one of her finest and subtly shaded film performances, though a viewer with a heart of stone would have to admit she looks too mature for the earliest scenes in which she is supposed to be a college co-ed. Finney by comparison is one-note and overbearing early on, though he settles down as the film progresses, or perhaps the grating persona is deliberately imposed by the actor. At any rate the chemistry between him and Hepburn is obvious and adds to the credibility of the story; reports of an on-set romance seem entirely plausible.<br /><br />Not all of \\"Two for the Road\\" has aged equally well--the attempts at outright comedy, such as a running gag involving a lost passport, are now strained and a sequence with a smug American couple and their monster of a daughter descends into caricature. But as a gritty portrait of a long-term relationship and the compromises one must make, it holds up well against many successors. It must be said in closing, too, that Hepburn wears her frequently outlandish fashions with enviable ease. Highly recommended.compromises one must make, it holds up well against many successors.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|I was glad to see that this important, radical film was crafted in such a brilliant fashion.  It powerfully delivers a message that we're often in denial about, that of a coming grim dystopia if we continue to cynically (or despairingly) sleep-walk through our lives.  Much of the setting and the events of \\"Children of Men\\" are familiar to us - economic refugees being dehumanized and herded like cattle, so-called \\"terrorists\\" being blown away by state terrorists, decaying infrastructures, and a political economy that is serving only the elite. <br />There is a moment in the film where someone cries out, \\"The oceans are dying!\\"  Actually, the oceans are being killed by giant factory trawlers and pollution; still, rarely is that hugely important subject even mentioned amid the endless diversions and establishment propaganda that most films are. <br />\\"Children of Men\\" makes us look not just at the suffering of injustice and societal breakdown, but it also gives us a glimpse of hope.  When the baby is born, refugees and warring factions alike pause for a few moments and remember their own humanity.  And some of the characters, like that played by Michael Caine, maintain their sense of humor, defiance and solidarity through all the troubles of the world they (and we) inhabit.   <br /> <br />The DVD's extras are not to be missed.  They include remarks on the crises we face and possible solutions from thinkers like Naomi Klein and James Lovelock.  There are also descriptions of how the film crew created incredibly long and intricately choreographed scenes.  They achieved some things in shooting this film that many thought weren't possible. <br />Also, the set designs and the music are fantastic. <br /> <br />I'd like to see the director come back with a sequel, but have it be something totally original.  Rather than it be like a \\"Terminator II\\" action/adventure movie, he could create a film where the baby is growing up in a world where the people got it together, transcended the ruling tyrants, and were engaged in building a sustainable society where peace and justice are the norm.  As unreal or \\"utopian\\" as that may sound, it would probably take less effort to achieve than what it takes to continue with the ecocidal militarized police state that we've been developing.   <br />There is actually a documentary that makes real that sort of hopeful vision.  It's called [[ASIN:0910420327 The Power Of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil]]  The heroes, instead of carrying guns, carry gardening tools.  And instead of racing around in cars, they casually ride bicycles.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I've been watching and recording the Planet Earth series this past month on my Tivo and knew I'd want to have the series on DVD as well.  I picked up the only version that is currently available around here, and that's the BBC version.   The narrator is different than Sigourney Weaver and I've really like Weaver.   I listened to part of the series with the British narrator and I'm still on the fence as to whether I like this as much or not and whether I'll keep it.   Sigourney's voice is very calming and clear while the British narrators voice is a bit 'lispy' and distracting, at least for me.    <br />The photography is great and the quality of the DVD seems good.   I'm watching it on an HDTV but with a standard DVD player with upconversion. I'm not willing to buy one of the new HD formats until the format war ends and one becomes a winner.   <br />Whichever narrator you like, you'll be sure to enjoy the photography and educational material in the DVDs. <br /> <br />
B00000I8UF|5.0|From the mid-1950s until the famous drummer's death in 1990, Art Blakey's \\"Jazz Messengers\\" was the trade name of various groups of musicians that worked and recorded under Blakey's leadership. Two tracks on this 1958 recording went on to become classic Blakey anthems, \\"Moanin'\\" and \\"Blues March\\". Each incarnation of the Jazz Messengers has played these two tunes, and countless jazz musicians consider them to be standards.<br /><br /> Several artists appear in this Jazz Messenger group, including Benny Golson (ts), Lee Morgan (t), Bobby Timmons (p) and Jymie Merritt (b). Of these four Lee Morgan easily shines the brightest, with amazing solos throughout and in particular on \\"Moanin'\\". Blakey was the ultimate mentor throughout his career; a man filled with such life-force and vigor that he attracted the best talent, bringing out the very best in them. This particular reissue is part of the Blue Note Rudy Van Gelder Edition series, treated to 24-bit digital remastering that offers listener's big sound. Simply put \\"Moanin'\\" is easily the single most significant album recorded by Art Blakey and his Jazz Messengers, so dragging your feet will not be tolerated. Buy it today.

0747572593|2.0|Before I start I have to say that I loved the English Patient film. Minghella (director) manages to capture the beautiful romance between the characters and the stark beauty of the desert like no other director has been able to.<br /><br />This book however, doesn't. Don't get me wrong. Ondaatje isn't a terrible writer. He's just not great. He tries very hard to be different (speechmarks are obviously passe?) and it shows. The English Patient novel doesn't really have any of the elements that make the movie so likeable. For starters, the book isn't coherent. It jumps everywhere. Some of the jumps are clear. Others are not. One gets the feeling that they're in there just for kicks, not for any real story-driving purpose.<br /><br />Secondly...a LOT of Ondaatje's metaphors just.don't.work.<br /><br />For example you have the ones that almost work:<br /><br />\\"I don't think (Clifton) he loved the desert, but he had an affection for it that grew out of awe at our stark order, into which he wanted to fit himself - like a joyous undergraduate who respects silent behaviour in a library.\\"<br /><br />The ones that seem very high school:<br /><br />\\"He (caravaggio) rides the boat of morphine. It races in him, imploding time and geography the way maps compress the world onto a two-dimensional sheet.\\"<br /><br />And the bewildering:<br /><br />\\"He (Kip) knew he was now a king...it was strange to him. As if he had been handed a large suit of clothes rhat he could roll around in and whose sleeves would drag behind him.\\"<br /><br />This is not so say that Ondaatje doesn't paint some beautiful imagery as well. He does. But those instances tend to be few and far between. He also has the infuriating tendency to marr prefectly stunning imagery. For example, at the beginning of the book, he gives you this fantastic image of a young boy dancing next to a fire. Next thing you know, semen is being picked up from the sand. ?!? He does this over and over again.<br /><br />I have never said this about any book/movie, but honestly, watch the movie as it is an infinitely better interpretation of the the book, than the book itself. The characters in the movie are likeable, and the story is complex and beautiful. The same, strangely, cannot be said of the book.br />I have never said this about any book/movie, but honestly, watch the movie as it is an infinitely better interpretation of the the book, than the book itself.

0143038419|3.0|I like the first part of the book when she was in Italy and the last part when she was in Bali. I got lost when she went to India in the middle. I mean do you really have to look that hard to find God? Maybe I just don't get why you would need the hours of meditation for days on end and having crazy conversations with your mind for months. It just went on for too long. Everyone has their own journey though and hers is a fantasy. Traveling the world, single with deep pockets. It's a good read, but I didn't like the fact that the whole journey was bought by a publishing company before she went and she did everything on her trip knowing that she was going to write about it later. That's kind of a cheesy way to do memoir.

B00005UEAR|5.0|Following the groundbreaking impact of Scenes from a Memory, which was perhaps the most important progressive metal album of the late 90's, everybody was curious what Dream Theater would do next. After nearly three years, the band came up with Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, which couldn't be further from the sound and style of its predecessor. Packed into two discs, the second one being a long-form composition broken into eight tracks for easier navigation purposes, Dream Theater chose to prove they were a truly progressive band. Rather than putting out another album that walked in the footsteps of Scenes from a Memory, they released a double CD album, with three of the five tracks on disc one exceeding the ten-minute mark (and \\"Misunderstood\\" clocks in at 9:34 anyway), thus sticking to their artistic integrity rather than commercial stardom.<br /><br />It baffles me how so many Dream Theater fans have turned a blind eye to this album because it sounds so different from their earlier work. I always thought that's what makes this band so special -- that they never repeat themselves and cater to the lowest common denominator. It is true that the first CD sees Dream Theater turning to their influences, and not only Rush and Metallica this time, but also to bands like Pantera on the groove-inflected \\"The Glass Prison\\", easily their heaviest song to date. It begins with the same static sound that finalised Scenes from a Memory and picks up an incredibly beautiful bass figure that sounds almost exactly like an acoustic guitar. Myung's tone is clean, big and uber-heavy. With crushing rhythm guitars, pounding bass, and aggresive vocals, the song is elevated to prog metal heaven when Rudess' understated keyboards appear behind the main instruments, and even Petrucci's shred-intensive guitar that many have lambasted (especially on Train of Thought) makes an invaluable contribution to the excellence of the song. Unlike its successor, the shred parts on this album all emerge after carefully built up sections on this one with an intense keyboard and bass unison; or the superb \\"Blind Faith\\", which is graced with a wonderful bluesy shred piece. It is here where Dream Theater comes back to their vintage prog roots, boasting a stunning solo piano performance, protruding bass arrangement, and all-around songwriting brilliance.<br /><br />The moodier pieces \\"Misunderstood\\" and the closing piece \\"Disappear\\" are both captured by undeniable Radiohead atmospherics. The flickering synth patches during the acoustic guitar intro on \\"Misunderstood\\" help thicken Petrucci's waves of dissonance at the end, adding to its intensity; whilst \\"Disappear\\" is arguably the most underrated Dream Theater ballad. The effects, sad piano melody, and Labrie's otherworldy vocals are too good to dislike. \\"The Great Debate\\" is the band's nod to the intricate rhythm arrangements of Tool, with both Portnoy and Petrucci providing a solid backbone to the song. Even Labrie's vocals evoke Maynard Keenan during the verses, but Dream Theater does add their own signature to it, mostly with Rudess' rising symphonic keyboard aesthetics and the clever mixing of opposing arguments that blast out from either speaker.<br /><br />The second disc is far from \\"let's do a real long one-song album\\" attitude. It brings forth their unparalleled songwriting ability, highlighting the movements with cleverly arranged recurring musical and lyrical themes. The CD is about different individuals with mental illness, from bipolarity to post-traumatic stress syndrome; to sychophrenia, autism, and separation anxiety. What makes this disc an utter success is that the themes are perfectly summarised at the end; and they are also greatly tied together through a strong melodic theme that is started off with Rudess in the beginning, developed by Petrucci (what a nice guitar tone!) in the middle and climaxed by guitar and keyboards at the end. A bit like Awake in this aspect, the unity is maintained throughout without ignoring strong songwriting ideas. Labrie's excellent singing is backed nicely by Portnoy and Petrucci, portraying the different moods and confusion of the characters. \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\" is unbridled heaviness, underpinned by killer drum staccato and Labrie's unique \\"diaologue\\"-style vocals. On the slower paced material, the helplessness of a mother being separated from her child is brought to the fore on \\"Goodnight Kiss\\", which begins peacefully and gradually transforms into its tragic finale -- give a listen to both the cries of the baby and its mother under Petrucci's moving guitar solo and Rudess' far-reaching synth colouring.

Labrie's excellent singing is backed nicely by Portnoy and Petrucci, portraying the different moods and confusion of the characters. \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\" is unbridled heaviness, underpinned by killer drum staccato and Labrie's unique \\"diaologue\\"-style vocals. On the slower paced material, the helplessness of a mother being separated from her child is brought to the fore on \\"Goodnight Kiss\\", which begins peacefully and gradually transforms into its tragic finale -- give a listen to both the cries of the baby and its mother under Petrucci's moving guitar solo and Rudess' far-reaching synth colouring.

0596009208|1.0|While this book may be intended for the beginner, it's diconnected brief writing style will lead inexperienced programmers to frustration and disgust.  The first chapter on fundimentals starts with a basic printed line (typical hello world! program) to the next exercise on IF statements.  Then the next directly to loops.  No beginning programming book should dive headfirst (pun intended) directly into loops on the first chapter.  The book offers little explanation of it's code examples which are usually in the form disconnected, nonfucntioning snippets of code in misalligned boxes peppering the pages.  Java is hard enough to learn without having to decypher crossword puzzles to find the answers to what code does.  Many times in the book, the authors will present a new code concept and ask to reader to guess what the code does without ever reveiling what the correct answer was.  You'll find that 90% of the reviews that gave this book a positive review was reviewed by programmers that were experienced in other programming languages and understood the core concepts of programming.  I would highly NOT reccommend this book to any beginner programmer and suggest one of the Deitel books instead.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|When I think of the nature shows I used to watch there were many short clips of things like a leopard running behind a gazelle. One of the best things about this series is their use of modern helicopter-mounted camera systems allowing them to film very long action sequences the likes of which I haven't seen before. The show's large budget and the filmmaker's patience and determination also allowed them to get some impressive footage from remote places.<br /><br />David Attenborough's voice is pleasing, but I think the actual content of his narration could have been better. Watch out as some US versions feature Sigourney Weaver as a narrator, which may or may not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />This series is one of those rare items that I think justifies High Definition, so you might want to wait until the HD DVD vs. Blu-Ray war is settled before buying a HD version.<br /><br />Lastly, I have to mention I couldn't help feeling a bit sad while watching the series because at the rate our planet is going down the drain many of these natural wonders will be gone soon.

B000CE9R26|5.0|Donna Summer's 1984 release, \\"Cats without claws\\", was the follow up to her smash from the year before, \\"She works hard for the money\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, it wasn't as successful, though it did manage to make the Billboard top 40, and won a Grammy for the passionate piano ballad, \\"Forgive me\\" (best inspirational song).<br /><br />Lead off single was an electronic remake of The Drifters' hit \\"There goes my baby\\", complete with a new ballad intro by Donna. The single made #21 on the hot 100.<br /><br />Other standouts were the catchy dance/rock of \\"Oh Billy please\\" (featuring soaring vocals from Summer; my favourite), the shimmery psychedelic spoken/sung rocker \\"Eyes\\" (excellent guitar and percussion), the beautiful horn'laden ballad \\"Maybe it's over\\" (with an outstanding vocal performance towards the end), the upbeat \\"Supernatural love\\" (the second single), the spoken/sung pop rock of \\"Cats without claws\\", and the stunning R&B/Calypso of \\"I'm free\\" (sung in falsetto).<br /><br />Obviously a labour of love by Summer, showcasing the many voices of Summer handling a variety of musical styles. It unfortunately didn't go down too well with a public used to Summer, the dance diva, but an excellent collection still.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Despite the reviews indicating the \\"inaccessibility\\" of the album, I purchased 10,000 days and was blown away.  While there are some similarities to the rythmic undertones of Lateralus, Kennan's vocal acrobatics take center stage on songs like \\"The Pot.\\" His vocal runs are nothing less than capitvating.  Tool continues to evolve into something that trancends their genre.  This album is worth the investment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
1400032717|5.0|I don't know if there is something about me personally that made me empathize with this character, but I can say that this book ran me from laughing-out-loud on one page to near tears two pages later.  And it was able to do it over and over again.  There is an obvious parallel in the situations of this book with the movie \\"Rainman\\" but the fact that the story is told from the point of view of the autistic character makes it even more effective. <br /> <br />I recommend this book highly to anyone who enjoys an emotional rollercoaster ride.

B00005JPD0|4.0|Deja Vu is a gripping and smart thriller about a Federal agent (Denzel Washington) who's investigating a ferry explosion. He's also investigating the murder of a woman who's death was staged to make it look like she was on the ferry. After showing his skills in finding evidence. He's taken to a top secret lab that has technology so advanced that they can investigate what led to the ferry explosion and who might've done it. Washington figures out that the equiptment isn't all that it seems. It actually can see into the past and might even be able to be used for time travel. He doesn't want to only use the technology to catch the killer but to stop the ferry explosion and to save the woman.<br /><br />  The movie is fascinating through-out with a really good cast too. Denzel Washington is good as always and I love the supporting cast too. Val Kilmer is pretty good in a small part as an agent who brings Washington in on the secret project. It's funny how he trys to lie about the technology not being as advanced as Washington is starting to believe it is. Jim Caviezel is pretty chilling as the villian as well. Such a talented actor shouldn't be type-casted as a villian though. I mean come on this guy was Jesus after all lol.<br /><br />  Anyway DEJAVU isn't only a good action thriller but it surprisingly works as a science fiction film as well. Plus the breakthrough technolgy time travel stuff is actually done in such a smart way that it almost convinced me that this kind of stuff exists. Even if I didn't entirely understand all the mumbo jumbo that was being said. The movie can be a little mind-blowing too. I'm still trying to figure out how everything is gonna work-out for Washington's character at the end. Still I can't say it's not a satisfying ending either.<br /><br />  I really liked this movie and think it was Tony Scott's best work in awhile. A lot of his movies have a little too much camera movements that distract away from the story and actors. He's more restrained here and just sits back and lets us get into the story more.rained here and just sits back and lets us get into the story more.
B00000IMYA|5.0|I've owned this record (\\"record\\" - what an old-fashioned word!), in some form or another, for about thirty-five years. And today is Duke's birthday anniversary, and Diminuendo and Crescendo was on the radio, and I listened. And the goosebumps came, and the tears of joy and emotion still flowed. The sense of occasion is matched by the magnificence of the performance - one of the greatest ever performances by the greatest band of all time. And, by the way, a masterpiece composition which did not receive its due on the original recording. What is NOT great here? Some of the highpoints: Jimmy Woode's pedal points in Diminuendo, Hodges' fills in Crescendo, the strutting Trombone section of Woodman, Jackson and Sanders - a miracle of section playing. Duke's jabs and fills (of course!), Woodyard in what is possibly the highpoint of his career, Cat Anderson taking us home at the end. Oh - and Paul Gonsalves! This performance is the apotheosis of everything from the wildest New Orleans Street Parade to the wailingest Albert Ayler collective avant-gospel freakout - and all what is in between. If you don't have this...well, why DON'T you have this?
1932907009|5.0|I liked the book.  I was disappointed with the lone 1-star reviewer who believes everything he reads off the internet and probably everything he reads in the Enquirer too.  The bottom line:  Blake makes money as a screenwriter.  He's gotten his foot in the door over 20 years ago and continues to MAKE MONEY with his craft.  If his script really was voted \\"worst,\\" who cares?  He got a paycheck, didn't he?<br /><br />Years ago I did two internships in my film school days as a scriptreader for two different studios.  The internship lasted about a year, maybe a little longer.  Out of the hundreds of scripts I read and did reviews for, perhaps only 2 were worth making into a film.<br /><br />The point is:  Most people can't write worth a damn.  If you can learn the craft of screenwriting well, you have an excellent shot at making it in the industry.<br /><br />The flip side:  If you think writing a script is a get-rich-quick scheme then you're in for a long and disappointing haul.  You can't get around having to learn to write and writing well.<br /><br />I like Blake's book because he is someone who has made it in the industry and has made millions from his scripts over the past 20 years.  I would never learn from someone who hasn't done it, including Robert McKees.<br /><br />This book is simple and step-by-step about what you should include in a well-written screenplay.  It's a fast read and doesn't bog the reader down with heavy structuring.<br /><br />The only thing that was missing is that I believe Blake should have included more about breaking into Hollywood and tips on making money in the industry.  Perhaps he has a second book planned for that (I hope).<br /><br />Definitely recommended.
1582701709|2.0|Some people may be actually lifted up and feel happy and/or happier by being said repeatedly that you can have anything you want, you can have anything you want, and you can have anything you want.

1400064287|5.0|As the Heath's point out, it is not enough to list the tips, you need the story for the ideas to stick, and both the tips and the story presented in this book are first rate.  The Heath's draw on psychology studies, marketing successes, as well as their own analyses to develop a book which is very useful, informative and entertaining - although I will say that I found the beginning a bit repetitious, so stick with the book, you will constantly learn new things.  Sticky ideas are important in all kinds of areas: technicians learn to do their jobs better by swapping job anecdotes.  <br /> <br /> The Heath's recognize that getting an idea to stick is not the same as conveying the full dimension of complex ideas, and they do not over simplify.  In fact, I wish some of the scientists would recognize, as the Heath's do, that while it is highly useful to draw on an existing schema to develop and present new ideas, such as the \\"selfish gene\\", schema's are approximate and are not sufficient to tell the whole story - maybe there would be fewer fruitless scientific arguments over which schema is correct. <br /> <br /> \\"Don't mess with Texas\\" (hugely successful anti-litter slogan). <br />
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I have loved Stevie Nicks since the first time I heard Landslide from the Fleetwood Mac White Album and then the gorgeous Silver Springs hooked me forever with all the rest of her classics, Sara, Gypsy, Gold Dust Woman, Bella Donna, After the Glitter Fades, etc.  HOWEVER, the real treat is the DVD of all her hit videos and listening to Stevie reminisce and share those moments with us again but on a more personal level.  The making of Bella Donna reminded me of how beautiful she truly was back then and still is.  \\"The feelings remain Stevie even after the glitter fades\\", THANK YOU!

B0002SVW3O|4.0|This is really more of a \\"sound collage\\" than a propper album. Only four of the tracks on here really count as \\"songs\\" persay, with the eight other tracks consisting mostly of ambient noises arranged in a fairly artistic manner. If you were expecting something like the other three Sigur Rós albums, this is not it. Honestly, had the band broken up before going on to record Agaetis Byrjun, their musical legacy would be virtually nonexistant, a mere curiousity of the late 90's Icelandic music scene for only the most serious collectors. As \\"experimental\\" as this album sounds, this is certainly not the most original work Sigur Rós has done.  <br /> <br />This is not to say that Von is without its charms. The ambient noise compiled here makes a great soundtrack to a quiet night at home reading, studying, or just staring off into space and thinking. Each of the four \\"songs\\" is masterfully constructed with an otherworldy quality remniscent of Rennaisance polyphony and early 90's shoegazer music that would be further developed into the style Sigur Rós bases their later albums on. Overall, this is a very pleasant listening experience if you don't feel like listening to conventional music and want something a bit more etherial. <br /> <br />The price listed is a bit high, but this might be worth purchasing if you're a die-hard fan or naturally interested in \\"unaccessible\\" works. For anyone casually interested, it's probably best to scour the internet or something; due to the rather iconic nature of the band, this recording is perhaps less obscure than one would expect.

The first half tells the author's story of surviving the most deadly concentration camps in World War 2.  The second half discusses Logotherapy, which is the brainchild of Dr. Frankl and later became known as the third school of psychology.  The memoir of the first half is engrossing and hard to put down.  The second half is a slower read and very academic as it gives an overview of logotherapy, but it is nonetheless interesting.

The extended version definitely gives you a deeper insight into the characters in the story.<br /><br />Contrary to what someone else's review, this movie has nothing to do with devil worship.

His attack on Mother Teresa for her associations with dictators and others of ill repute reminds one of the criticism that Christ is reported to have endured for eating with prostitutes and tax collectors.

B000025H0Q|5.0|Nick Drake was one of those artists whom I'd heard praised a thousand times in the past, but by whom I had never heard even a single note. So when I walked into Borders a couple months ago, I hadn't thought about him in months and had no intention of getting anything of his. But when I saw his name out of the corner of my eye in the \\"Folk\\" section, something - I can't say what - impelled me to pick up a copy of BRYTER LAYTER. I had no idea what I'd find inside. And that made listening to this album for the first time all the more magical. <br /> <br />The categorization of music is a futile exercise at best, but BRYTER LAYTER is especially hard to pigeonhole into a single defined \\"style\\". The music contained herein is just as likely to recall (or rather foreshadow) the jazz-pop of Joni Mitchell's COURT & SPARK (\\"Poor Boy\\") as the British folk of the Fairport Convention (\\"One of These Things First\\"), dressed in Nick Drake's exquisite guitar and strings straight out of \\"Yesterday\\", accessorized by delicate flute and harpsichord. But then you have that alto sax appearing from nowhere in the baroque folk-pop of \\"At the Chime of a City Clock\\", or the peals of distant tom-tom thunder in \\"Hazey Jane I\\". And I swear the entire Belle & Sebastian catalogue might well be modeled on \\"Hazey Jane II\\". \\"Fly\\" sounds like some timeless nineteenth century art-song, it's so lovely and yearning. And \\"Northern Sky\\"... I don't know where this comes from, and I don't especially care. I just know it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. <br /> <br />Maybe the most accurate comparison I can make is to Van Morrison's contemporaneous, similarly impossible-to-classify masterwork ASTRAL WEEKS. But that still that doesn't do Mr. Drake and his record justice. Maybe BRYTER LAYTER doesn't defy categorization so much as it simply ignores it. Its pastoral world cannot be limited by such tags as \\"folk\\" or \\"rock\\" or any other label you care to think of or invent. <br /> <br />I'm a musicaladventurer. I love to discover new artists and new albums and new sounds. But the best music, the stuff that really sticks with you, is familiar. Not samey or derivative, but familiar - comforting. So when you listen to it, even though you've never heard it before, you have heard it before, if you know what I mean. Like meeting an old friend for the first time. Like BRYTER LAYTER.
B00005CDNK|1.0|I agree with John (from N.Y.), these 24-bit re-masters of the Abba catalogue were a big letdown. In a side by side comparison, the original discs sounded much better than these.

B00005JN0T|5.0|I'm not a devotee of Will Smith/Asimov/Sci-fi nor a film buff, so there's no reason for me to prefer this kind of film, or bring any bias or preconceived baggage to watching it, and I rented it originally. However, I have to say this is a thoroughly absorbing, thought provoking and intelligent film which, for these reasons, kept me entertained right from the start - and isn't that the whole point? The film works on many levels, from an appreciation of the superb set design, CGI design and special effects (so good that they sometimes detract from the storyline as your chin hits the floor in amazement!), good dialogue, great action sequences, an excellent performance from Will Smith, and a central character that can draw out your sympathy and even steps it up as the film progresses, and is the real star of the whole show, having to face the ultimate choice each of us must make - choosing one's own destiny.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, I envy you. And yes, I have bought a copy. If you only watch it once, you'll miss so much.

0062502182|5.0|I absolutly loved this book.  This is one of those books that has a lasting impression on the reader.  This makes every reader reflect upon thier own life and think about what their own \\"personal legend\\" is.  This author makes a lasting impression through this work through teriffic storytelling.   <br /> <br />I am going to include my own personal reflect that I wrote after reading this book.  The reason why i am including it is because everyone that reads this book will reflect upon their own life. <br /> <br />A Reflection After Reading \\"The Alchemist\\" <br /> <br />I recently just finished reading the book \\"The Alchemist\\"   <br /> <br />This is a terrific book that I recommend everyone to read.  It is a book that tells a great story, which is loaded with imagery that the reader is able to make personal life connections to.  <br /> <br />This story talks about how everyone has a \\"Personal Legend\\" in there life.  A \\"Personal Legend\\" is a calling in ones life that is held deeply within your heart.  It is something that you strongly desire to do with your life.  This book tells the story of a Spanish Shepard named Santiago and his obtaining of his \\"Personal Legend.\\"  Along the way Santiago experiences many hardships that make obtaining his \\"Personal Legend\\" difficult, but Santiago learns the way of the world and this helps during his quest of obtaining his \\"Personal Legend.\\"   Santiago's journey to obtain his \\"Personal Legend\\" was a long road in which he met many people and most importantly learned a lot about himself. <br /> <br />After reading this book I was originally going to write a reflection and discuss my own \\"Personal Legend\\" or desire of becoming a teacher.  I was originally going to discuss the road I have embarked upon so far including all the hardships I have encountered along with the hardships I am anticipating.  After contemplation I decided that I was not going to post this on myspace because it would seem very \\"Narcissistic\\" of me (Even though myspace has Narcissistic values to it).  Obtaining ones \\"Personal Legend\\" may at times be a selfish endeavor, but it is an endeavor that one should hold close to ones heart in order to reach absolute happiness.   <br /> <br />It is important that everyone has a \\"Personal Legend\\" within there heart and mind.  In my opinion it is also key that everyone also has an oasis or a place that provides refuge and relief while obtaining their \\"Personal Legend.\\"  An example an oasis within my life is my avid love for hiking and traveling throughout the National Parks of the Continent.  For me this provides a sanctuary of refuge and relief during my quest to obtain my \\"Personal Legend\\" of becoming a teacher.  It is important that everyone picks out an oasis within their life because this place of refuge will help you overcome the challenges that occur during the journey of obtaining your \\"Personal Legend.\\"   <br /> <br />Again as I stated above I am not going to go into details about my own \\"Personal Legend\\" because it is something that is held within my heart and mind.  After reading this book by Paulo Coelho it allowed me to do some personal reflection upon my own life.  By reading and reflecting I came to the conclusion that I can obtain my own \\"Personal Legend\\" but I will experience challenges along the way that will test my heart and mind.  It is important that I keep this lesson in mind during my journey to obtain my \\"Personal Legend\\" and ultimately this will result in a more fulfilling life. <br /> <br />In conclusion I am once again going to tell everyone that they should read the book The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.  In reading this book hopefully you will be able to reflect and figure out what your \\"Personal Legend\\" or calling in life is, and most importantly you will fallow your heart in order to obtain this \\"Personal Legend.\\"  <br /> <br />By: Joey Leone   <br />

076790382X|5.0|This book is great.  It does not read like a traditional story.  Instead it is a composite of a bunch of articles that Mr. Bryson wrote for a British newspaper after returning to America after living in Britain for 20 or so years.  Each chapter reads as a separate article that he wrote for the paper.  The chapters are very short and sometimes he makes connections to previous articles or chapters. <br /> <br />I thought this book was hilarious.  If you enjoy the humor of the show Sienfeld each chapter of this book reads as a basis for a Sienfeld episode.  That is the best way I can describe it.  The reason for this is because he makes humor out of situations that every American faces.   <br /> <br />There are so many great chapters in this book.  Some of my most memorable topics include: toothpaste hotline, tax forms, experiencing the outdoors indoors, technology, and many others. <br /> <br />In conclusion if you like the humor of the show Sienfeld you must read this book.  If you do not care for that show then pass up on this book. <br />
B00005CDNF|1.0|I agree with John (from N.Y.), these 24-bit re-masters of the Abba catalogue were a big letdown. In a side by side comparison, the original discs sounded much better than these. The originals were brighter and plenty full; just like the original album sounded.<br /><br />On the other hand, these 24-bit discs sound slightly muddy and the high end (which includes acoustic guitars and cymbals) are flat or dead sounding thanks to the no-noise solution. My advice, is to save your money and keep your old discs.
B000J103X4|1.0|Whether or not Game really did the thuggish things about which he crows on this CD, I revile his glorification of the low life.<br /><br />Kids don't need more negative stereotypes; or to hear African Americans debasing themselves and their women and devaluing human life.<br /><br />And as for the explicit language, while I have zero sympathy for Don Imus, examples like those set in this CD unfortunately gave him, other &#34;shock jock&#34; D.J.s, and the public, the mistaken notion that derogatory terms are nowadays okay.<br /><br />I find nothing artistic, or remotely positive in these cuts--or others like them. Yuck doesn't even come close to describing how awful this is.
0812975219|5.0|Fooled by Randomness is based on a basic truth about humans: we are not very good at statistics, especially if we simply rely on our instincts. For example, we fear airplanes, sharks and terrorists, yet we rarely think about mundane risks like cancer and car accidents. Similarly, we are not good at judging investments. We think that the broker who picked three winners in a row must know something; not necessarily so, says Taleb.<br /><br />This book is well worth reading, especially if you ever invest in individual stocks or managed stock funds (it will probably talk you out of doing so). It certainly is not an investment guide, however, so do not buy it if you are looking for a hot stock tip.<br /><br />Taleb has a quirky writing style. This certaintly is not a \\"pretty\\" book. Nevertheless, it is easy enough to read.<br /><br />Taleb, a stock trader himself, does to seem to hold most other traders in high regard.<br /><br />Taleb has a unusual way of looking at things; one gets the idea that he is somewhat arrogant and a bit of a crank. That being said, Taleb's unique viewpoint and style do not get in the way, and in the end are just one more reason to read this book.
B000NA1OXY|2.0|Avril's songs are good at the gym when your doing cardio. I've liked all her albums, until this one. I think the right word to describe it would be extreme regression. Just about all the songs and lyrics, sound like they belong on a Mickey Mouse album.  <br /> <br />And the RIAA is wondering why CD sales are dropping? No effort whatsoever was put into this album. Most of the songs, you just wish you never heard, not even once.
B00005JPPL|4.0|This film is very well made and its subject matter is about a man's (Nicolas Cage) ability to see about 2 minutes into the future. In real life it's a rare ability that some people have in some particular area(s). <br />Cage's character, who uses his ability to perform magic tricks in a stenchy Las Vegas downtown casino, has been waiting for his true love (Jessica Biel) for years and he saw her in his mind for years. Once he meets her in a Diner, his abilities extend to see the future a couple of hours in advance, and he realizes that based on his actions he can change the immediate future to some extent. <br />And that's the interesting part of the film to see various possible outcomes of the immediate future if he, Cage's character, makes this or that decision/action at the moment. This flick is executed very well, and yes, because Cage being an Elvis fan to the bone, there's some Elvis touch in there. Nicolas Cage, who years ago I wouldn't have cared to see him in any movie, has grown as an actor and again delivers a superb performance - he's really a great actor. <br />Julian Moore wasn't too exciting as she plays a special FBI agent or something, but her character and performance seems flat. Also, the script had its problems with some lose ends here and there as well as some high-school quality dialogue with the lines of the supporting actors at times. <br />Jessica Biel is appealing as usual and she ads color and brings life/authenticty to the film. <br />The overall storyline of the nuclear bomb threat seems somewhat of an afterthought, but that's okay, because I think the main issue is that phenomenon of certain people having the ability to see briefly ahead for a few seconds or a minute and making certain decisions based on such an ability, while in this flick of course the ability is Hollywood overemphasized, but it's a movie. Why do I give this film 4 stars, because it's stylish, and the acting escpecially by Nicolas Cage is excellent, and it's interesting and a fun film to watch.
0143038419|5.0|This is just a delightful book.   Ms. Gilbert's wit and wisdom makes me want her as my best friend....or atleast, my travelling companion.In parts she is laugh-out-loud funny and in others she draws you in to a center of knowing which is almost painful. <br />I really hated to finish this book. <br />It was a wonderful adventure.

B00005V1B2|5.0|This is the ultimate blend of rock and folk. However, this album is the only Camel album without any lyrics.
B000066SBB|4.0|My only complaint is that there is noticeable tape hiss on a few of the songs.  I listen a lot on a portable stereo, <br />so it was quite easy to pick up.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Ah Yes, PT returns with a fully thoughtout studio album. Fear of a Blank Planet. I, a strong and devoted PT fan, am quite pleased with this album. i feel this album is a strong attempt to achieve the oppisite of what you're used to hearing, avoidance of cliche. So, 98% of the time while listening to this album, you rarely know what's coming next, and if you think you do you're wrong. This album does please though. Good followup to Deadwing. For Steven Wilson's attempt at mastering this album, i'd say he did mostly well. Though higher frequencies feel cramped sometimes and also some drum fills are crushed a little too which I was a little dissapointed with. Still, not enough to give 4 stars.  <br />This album has a less warmer feel than previous albums, even played on professional monitors, but the musicianship and writing outside the box definetly overpowers these flaws. Worth it?? YES.  <br />All in All this DOES sound like a PT album. And this puppy works wonders when played on a system with surround dolby pro logic encoding....which any AV reciever has.  <br />Get this album.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Perhaps this movie was just supposed to be a social commentary without any resolve.  Great acting all around, even from the Morrocan extras who weren't professional actors.  I liked the idea of how these four separate stories were connected by one unfortunate bullet, but there were some scenes that were pointless.     The Japanese deaf-mute character seemed unneccesarry.  What was the point of Rinko Kikuchi getting naked and showing her crotch?  She got an oscar nomination for this?  I mean the center of the story wasn't even around her, it was around her father's hunting rifle which caused all the riff-raff to begin with.  While her acting was very good, I felt the role of Chieko was was invented merely to get the Asian chick naked on screen. She's showing her hooch and boobs, give her an oscar nomination.  Why not?    Cate and Brad did great as usual, and Cate did an exceptionally good job being the annoying wife.  Who the hell runs away to Morocco over depression and leaves their kids with the nanny who, by the way, is an illegal immigrant who already had other plans?  Cate Blanchett's character had a sister that Brad Pitt kept calling.  Why didn't he leave the kids with her?     Well-acted scenes and character relations but no point.  At best a well filmed moving canvas.
B000O174CM|4.0|I saw the orginal Los Angeles production with Jennifer Holliday.  It was rightfully described as a living film.  Every scene flowed into the next, no blackouts.  Add to that a brilliant book and score with sets, costumes and lighting to match, you have an incredible experience.    When I heard that Bill Condon (who adapted the screenplay of Chicago)was writing and directing, I was happy.  Too many musical transfers have been ruined by putting them in the hands of directors who have never had any musical experience (John Huston & Annie and Richard Attenburough & A Chrous Line). But unfortunately, it just proves how great a director Rob Marshall is.    Dreamgirls is about family, fame and how the American public rewards beauty over talent.  The film forgets this and trys to be about the Motown experience and doesn't accomplish this.    The Dreamette are three friends that dream of fame as a girl group.  Effie is the lead singer of the group and her brother CC writes the songs.  The girls go to a local talent competition and meet promoter Curtis Taylor. He immediately sees the girl's potential.  To get them started he makes them the back up singer for fading star James \\"Thunder\\" Early.    When it is time for the Dreamettes to breakaway to become The Dreams, Curtis moves the beautiful Deena to be the lead and makes the more talented Effie step to backup.  This creates an on going conflict between the two divas.    Eventually, Effie is replaced and the Dreams becomes supertars.  Effie eventually rebuilds her career with the help of her old manager. (To me the best moment is Jennifer singing \\"I'm Changing\\")  CC eventually realizes that Curtis only concern is the bottom line and goes back to Effie to help her comeback.    This sets up a final battle between Effie and Curtis when Curtis wants CC's new song for The Dreams to lauch Disco.  This leads to the great scene where CC puts it all on the line.  In the end, everyone sees Curtis for what he is and all the Dreams reunite for one last time.    Add to this basic storyline, riots, assinations, and drugs and you have the movie.    Part of the problem is that Condon wanted to make this an issue film instead a of a slice of entertainment history.  The other problem is that he does not trust the musical forum.      There are a number of occasions where he omitted the intro of a song (sometimes he would use the lyrics spoken!) and other times use the intro??  The best example is in Cadillac Car.  In  the musical, the intro to the song talks about how different groups of used ownership of Cadillac Cars to prove that they were equal to the White upper class.    People say that musicals are impractical because people don't break out in song in real life. Well 90% of all films have characters doing improbable things. But most people will see a film if it is done well, people don't care!    One final thing is that Condon reduced all characters to supporting roles there were really no leading performaces, this is a ensemble movie.  (I don't really know if this is a positive or negative.)    When Ann Reinking revived Chicago, I told people that if they never saw Bob Fosse's original production with Chita, Gwen and Jerry, then see the new show and you will love it. But if you had, don't expect the new production to be as good.  That is what I say of this film.  You will still like the film but the stage production was definitely superior.
B00005JPAO|5.0|During the Middle Ages, the pope was the person that kings did not offend lightly. The English King, Henry II, was flogged for his role in the death of Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury. The German emperor, Henry IV, had to march around the papal palace in sack cloth and ashes for his misdeeds. Ironicaly, the Queen is the head of the Church of England but she has to answer to an authority even more capricous and mercurial than popes...public opinion as shaped by superficial celebrity-worshipping media coverage. People love hero/bad guy stories so when Princess Di died, the press was busy turning her into a saint and the royal family into cads. Never mind the complicating factors that there had been a very nasty recent divorce with Di running to the press spilling out intimate details of their lives that we had no business knowing, the public wanted to see the Queen blubber and cry on TV like some guest on the Jerry Springer show. I have a feeling Queen Elizabeth would have gladly traded penances with Henry II and been flogged at the tomb of Thomas Becket instead.  Elizabeth came from a generation that valued emotional restraint in the face of calamity. When John Kennedy died, the thing everyone praised was Jackie's calm dignity. Nowadays, she would have been scorned as a cold fish for not throwing herself screaming on the casket. The movie explored these generational tensions very well. Mirren was perfect in the role.
0399230033|5.0|This is one of the best childrens book ever! Some reviews complain about few words but, come on, this book is about creative thinking, humor, and looking over and over at the hidden details in the pictures. <br />My three children all have loved this book over the years and recently pulled it out again to discover more little details - and they are ten, seven and five years old and still consider these thier favorites.  You MUST get \\"10 minutes till bedtime\\" by the same author! My kids aboslutely love the little details in that one. We find new things to dicover almost everytime. The books actually pair together as there are details from both books in \\"10 minutes till bedtime\\" - if you look closely. <br />If you use your imagination, laugh along with your children by pointing out silly and interesting details (like where did the balloon go) in the pictures and making them fun for your child - you should find this book (and 10 min til bedtime) some of your favorites.
B000KRNG5E|5.0|the movie is definately argento's most surreal one. along with suspiria and phenomena, this one is among his most bizarre and fun. dare i say that is shares more in common with a less character driven david lynch film over a hitchcock one. if you liked suspiria for the visuals, lighting, and supernatural delving, this is sure to please. hopefully, dario will finish the 3 mothers thing and cover the mater laciorum(sp?) story.    anyways, a lot of underground dvd collectors are probably wondering about this new blue underground version of this movie. i say this. if you have the anchor bay version, never fear. both versions are exactly the same, save for the fact that the newly released one is region zero and the insert is doubled sided along with the clear case. the anchor bay one does come with a nice interview book insert though.  if you dont have this movie,id recommend to pick the blue underground version up.(ahem, cheaper!) if you have the anchor bay one (likewise to myself) theres no need to shell out 12 more bucks..i mean unless you plan to visit folks out of the USA or adore the clear see thru cases.    anyways, enough rambling from this dvd nerd.
B000N3T0DW|4.0|Pedro Almodovar's \\"Volver\\" is a warm-hearted domestic comedy, tinged with melodrama and touched by the supernatural.  It is, above all, a made-to-order showcase for the beautiful and talented Penelope Cruz, who, returning to her native language and working with a world-class filmmaker, finally gets the chance to strut her stuff as an actress for all to see.<br /><br />If Cruz reminds us of anyone in this film, it is of the young Sophia Loren of \\"Two Women,\\" a film which also seemed tailor-made to feature the acting talents of a legendary screen beauty (and Loren did indeed earn a Best Actress Oscar in 1961 for her efforts in that film).  And like Loren in that work, Cruz, through her hairstyle and wardrobe, actually attempts to tamp down some of her physical allure and beauty (as if that were possible) - and is all the sexier for it!  Cruz takes full command of the screen playing Raimunda, the overworked wife of a ne'er-do-well named Paco, and mother of a teenager named Paula (from a different father).  When Paco attempts to rape his stepdaughter, the young girl inadvertently kills him, forcing Raimunda to hide the body in the freezer of a defunct restaurant next door.  Raimunda  extracts triumph from tragedy, however, by taking the restaurant over and turning it into a successful business.  Meanwhile, Raimunda's skittish sister, Sole, has encountered the corporeal spirit of their deceased mother, who has decided to move in with Sole, suitcase and all, to make amends for earlier ruptures with her daughters and to reveal a crucial secret about the past that may make it possible for the women to get on with their futures.<br /><br />Like virtually all of the Spanish filmmaker's works - \\"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,\\" \\"All About My Mother,\\" \\"Talk to Her,\\" etc. - \\"Volver\\" deals with themes of particular interest to women, including \\"the sisterhood of women,\\" the roles they are called upon to play in a male-dominated society, the complexities inherent in mother/daughter relationships, and the way in which dreams once deferred can suddenly bloom into fruition the moment a woman has broken free of male domination and struck out on her own as an independent force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />Yet, \\"Volver\\" is not a heavy-handed, pro-feminist, male-bashing screed (men hardly appear in it at all, in fact), but rather a sly, touching tale of the exclusive bond women share as they experience the ups and downs, the joys and vicissitudes of everyday life.  And even though the plot strains credibility at times, at least it doesn't stumble into unbridled melodramatic absurdity the way \\"All About My Mother\\" did.<br /><br />Beyond Cruz, there are excellent performances by Carmen Maura, Lola Duenas, Blanca Portillo, and Yohana Cobo. Finally, cinematographer Jose Luis Alcaine has captured the world of these women in all its sunny, cleanly detailed, multi-colored splendor.<br /><br />However, while the hues may indeed be dazzling and vibrant, it is Cruz herself who is the true visual stimulus of this movie.

B000K9L32U|5.0|I was a huge fan of Take That way back when I was a teen.......I even followed Gary Barlow's career when the group separated. Gary's voice is just one of the sweetest, greatest voices you can ever come across. It just makes you want to have him singing in your ear. I'm much older now so when I heard that Take That was getting back together it not only made my day but my whole year! The album is great, some songs better than the others as in almost every record any artist puts out. It's great to see all the members stand out, not just Gary in the spotlight. So if you liked Take That 12 years ago like when you heard \\"Back for good\\" for the first time, you'll sure enjoy this album as well.
B000FSFBEM|5.0|This is a must-have.  I bought my copy in the 1970's, as I had not read all the stories when I was a kid.  I re-read it from front to back every few years.  It's just delightful escapism literature.  And Christopher Morley's introduction tells you how to easily tell a dyed-in-the-wool fan of Sherlock Holmes, as they'll discuss \\"endless delicious minutiae\\".  Morley also describes the qualms that went around the world when Doyle apparently killed off Sherlock Holmes along with Moriarty in the falls.  Doyle probably did that because he was tired of writing the stories, but the public couldn't get enough, so the series started up again.  What a legacy of great fiction!
B000NA28IE|1.0|Lord of the Rings and Harry potter, even Narnia have set the standard and shown what can be done in bringing fantasy to life on screen. They have also shown producers and studios the amount of demand there is for a well executed fantasy movie. The risk has diminished greatly for committing to a substantial budget to take a best selling fantasy novel to the screen. They have also showed that the key to success is to preserve as far as possible the original book and allow the characters the space and time to be developed so people can care about them and lose themselves in the reality of the fantasy. If this requires a 3 hour movie to bring the book to life then the public will gladly accept it. You do not have to be a genius to have worked all this out. <br />So why oh why have they ruined Eragon by violating all these self evident guidelines to success. Without exaggeration quite frankly the producers, Director and sript writer must have the collective IQ of an ant whose had a frontal lobotamy. <br />I saw the movie first and then I read the book.The book is highly derivative of all fantasy fiction and owes its life to Lord of the Rings in many many ways. But that's ok. We can all take pleasure in a well crafted derivation of LOTR. And Eragon (Aragon?), is a very well crafted imitation, and incidentally Eldest is even better. As Paolini gets older his characters are developed better, and in a curious way it fits with Eragon growing up from boy to man. <br />But the movie has completely destroyed the book. The cast, the effects and the look of the movie are fine and in some parts even great but for no apparent good reason they decided to completely rewrite the book and leave most of it in the trash can. There is no people development, the plot is twisted to a pale shadow of the original and all of this was so unnecessary. The film could easily have been longer to allow character development, the plot could have stuck to the book more closely. This is the most frustrating thing about the movie. It would almost have been easier not to screw it up. I cannot understand how this got through without someone noticing that along the way they forgot to put the book in the movie. <br />On a more positive note. The world is a better place for having this soon to be trilogy for us all to enjoy. Eldest is great and I look forward to the final part. I do hope that the other two parts are made into movies but with a different team at the helm. The cast and the effects can be kept and with a new director I am sure they will be able to bring the book to life. There are some really great actors here who only need the chance to show what they can do. As for Eragon I am afraid it has been ruined and is unlikely to be ever done right. I can only think that there must be some story behind the stupidity of the production team. Did they have their budget pulled half way through the movie, did the Director have a twin brother and they got the wrong one, did they really make the movie of the book but then they left the print in a taxi and lost over an hour of the plot. I could go on, but really it is the sheer stupidity of the mistakes made on this movie that are imposible to comprehend and in the end are so very sad. How splendid this could have been.
B00006RINF|5.0|I have owned this for over 2 years and it is still in my car's CD wallet (it holds 24). This CD is a great companion in traffic. While the band's previous releases are technically more interesting and diverse, this one is the most narrowly focused and the results are special. Swamped and Heaven's A Lie are the 2 cuts most people are familiar with, but the rest of the CD is also very strong. Angel's Punishment is the only really jarring cut on the disc. Overall, this disc is one that won't have you bypassing tracks. It is that good.
B000002G85|3.0|This is a pretty okay album, actually. Crisp, professional, laid back blues-rock that occasionally courts brilliance. Let It Rain is a good example of that. Only a guitarist of Clapton's calibur could've played that kind of solo. Of course there's also his hit cover of J.J. Cale's After Midnight, a fun Mardi Gras-R&B hybrid, and the live favorite Blues Power. Those three are the album's strongest points by far, but there are some other goodies too: the horn-powered, funky Slunky; blues-pop on Bad Boy, and folk-blues on Lonesome and a Long Way from Home (a clear ancestor of 461 Ocean Blvd.'s Give Me Strength). And Clapton had a hand in most of the songwriting too, which is cool by me. A couple downsides, though. The lyrics are weak - Clapton never was much of a poet in the first place - and some of it is simply inconsequential pop, such as Loving Me Loving You, Easy Now, Don't Know Why and Told You for the Last Time. This laid the groundwork for Clapton's strongest studio album (461 Ocean Blvd), has its moments, and is nicely mellow (unlike some of his other solo stuff, which is annoyingly mellow). But it's not a work of genius. Then again, '70s Clapton wasn't exactly an innovator - damn good guitarist, though.
B000002IGP|5.0|Ratt  might only be considered just another \\"hair metal\\" band of the 1980's, but this came out in 1984, long before the term \\"hair metal\\" was born. In fact, during this time period, a number of metal bands were coming out of California, and hitting the pop music charts like a hellion. This was such an enjoyable time of \\"pop\\" music, as not only did we have some great Metal bands on the charts, but some great RnB such as Michael Jackson and  Lionel Richie, plus some great New Wave such as The Cars and Blondie, and some other great one hit wonders and pop music forces such as Duran Duran and Madonnna. Plus we still had some great bands of the 70's such as Yes, and Rush crossing over to the use of synth. music. There was so much to choose from (unlike today's Pop with Nu Metal bands that sound like every 1000 other bands, Punk-pop, and Boy/Girl bubblegum pop that we thought died in the mid 90's. OH, back to Ratt's \\"Out of the Celler\\" Every track on this CD is excellent, and I consider it a great Classic of Metal. Even though by todays standards it is tame, it still is a pleaurable listen, and Ratt might have been one of the better West Coast (later termed hair Metal) bands of all time..ENJOY
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I loved the music in Pride and Prejudice so I bought the CD, it is wonderful!
B000O178BY|4.0|I have to admit that before this album, I was an armature NIN fan.  I had heard individual songs here and there on the radio, other people's CDs and pandora.com.  After reading rave reviews for the latest release by the band, I decided I would take the next step and purchase an this CD.<br /><br />I started by listening to individual songs on NIN's MySpace page, and the experience left me disappointed.  The songs seemed to lack the drive and intricate construction of the more popular \\"Closer\\" or \\"Head Like a Hole.\\"  \\"Survivalism\\" came at least somewhat close to the intensity I had come to suspect from Nine Inch Nails, but still fell short of expectation.<br /><br />Despite my initial disappointment with what I previewed, purchased the album.  I have to say, I'm very glad I did.  While the individual songs seem to break apart and fall short of true glory, they piece together to make a strong balanced work.  \\"Year Zero\\" is proof that the art of an album isn't dead.<br /><br />As previously mentioned, \\"Survivalism\\" is the proper single from the album.  Despite being written for a more even crowd, it fits well into the overall story arc and tonal quality of the album.  The compilation takes a strong political stance (have you ever known Trent Reznor to be subtle with his messages?), which not all people will agree with.  \\"Capital G\\" bashes the current administration with few apologies, and while some (such as myself) will find the lyrics amusing, be aware that this album takes a partisan stance.  \\"The Good Soldier's\\" descending minor tone produces an almost haunting quality, while still maintaining drive.  I could comment on all of the songs of the disk, but I prefer leave some discovery to the listener.<br /><br />In short, Nine Inch Nails has produced an album that isn't for radio consumption, nor should it be borrowed.  This album demands to be owned, and when listening, the full effect will be lost if it is not played from start to finish.  As the last piano solo sounds out, this piece hangs in the air, its effect not fading for hours.<br /><br />I had always trusted that Reznor and company were geniuses, and this album has provided the necessary proof.solo sounds out, this piece hangs in the air, its effect not fading for hours.   <br /> <br />I had always trusted that Reznor and company were geniuses, and this album has provided the necessary proof.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This album has alot of my favorites, plus the 2 versions of \\"I'm Having a Party\\", and \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\".   The guitar play in \\"Quitter\\"  is so good-extremely catchy!   I love, love, love \\"Ain't no Quitter\\" and don't understand why it didn't have more airtime. And \\"Having  A Party\\" just makes you want to move - it's so totally upbeat.    Plus all the other songs-I love all of her music, so it's hard for me to pick favorites.  I have all of Shania's albums and download them onto miy MP3 so I can hear them while I work out, etc.  I'm anxiously waiting for her to give us another album!  BUt this is a great one to buy and enjoy.

B000MV9026|1.0|I have three kids that will watch a movie over and over again, even if the movie is not that good. Not once have they requested to watch this one again. We watched it once. <br /> <br />To be fair, I caught it about halfway through when my kids were watching it, and I stood with my hands on my hips trying to figure out what the movie was about. Once I figured it out... <br /> <br />I didn't like it. Stinky. <br /> <br />I am annoyed that even though I read many of the negative reviews on Amazon, I still bought it. I just don't think that the way it was marketed was fair. It's not a feel good story with dancing penguins. It's a bummer. Okay, done. <br /> <br />Good animation, though.  1.5 stars.
B000002ADT|5.0|After 637 five star reviews, one wonders whether there's anything more one could possibly add? This album has consistently won the top spot of every 'favourite' or 'best' jazz album poll that I know of over the last ten years or so. It's easy to see why. It's just done it again and \\"So What\\" recently won the number one spot on a 'top 500 favourite jazz records' survey conducted by theJazz, a new digital jazz radio station here in the UK.<br /><br />\\"A Jazz Masterpiece\\". \\"Perhaps the most influential & best selling jazz record ever made\\". \\"The definitive version!\\" It's not often that I agree with the accolades record companies put on their CD sticker labels (it's not that I'm arrogant or believe that I know it all, just that I believe record companies will say anything to sell their products).<br /><br />But these superlatives - all attributed to \\"Kind of Blue\\", simply cannot be argued with. This is without a doubt the best jazz CD in my collection and over the years I've had any number of friends (none of whom are jazz fans, I should stress) walk into my home while it's been playing, immediately request to know who it is and then subsequently go out and buy it. In my view this CD transcends the musical; I feel it is a complete and flawless piece of art. Where many jazz musicians, especially these days, go out of their way to show how clever they are and how well they've mastered their instruments, Miles Davis just was clever. He didn't need to do that much to show it.<br /><br />This is undeniably a jazz recording but it is full of pop sensibilities. It's all about the melody and improvisation within, around and over that melody. It's brilliant! \\"All Blues\\" (which also made the top ten in the theJazz poll) makes me want to dance every time I listen to it. Another of my favourite songs, \\"Blue In Green\\", also made the top ten in the poll - a phenomenal achievement no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />There's not much else I could possibly say about this album that hasn't already been said. I will say this though: with the best intentions there is just no way the 30sec sound clips on here can give you any idea of the enormity of this recording. For example, it isn't until 2mins 2secs into \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" (my personal favourite cut of all) that John Coltrane's exquisite solo kicks off and it's a whole 3mins and 47secs before we hear Cannonball Adderley's response. This is just one example but what we have here is a set of songs that really need to be heard in their entirety for any real idea of what's on offer to be realised.<br /><br />If you are a jazz lover or even just a lover of good music and you don't already have this album (a state of affairs that is very difficult to imagine), go out on a limb and take the risk. You will not regret it. It just isn't possible. Long live Miles Davis!album that hasn't already been said.

B000AM4PBS|5.0|This item rocked! Not only was it cheap, it came in a fantastic and unique case compared to other sets!! So colorful!! I still haven't had the time to watch them all... I'm only on season 3! That's why I got the set though because eventually I will have the time, and I can always watch my favorite episodes over and over again!. I even have the script from \\"The one with Joey's Bag\\" and I can't wait to watch the episode with the script in hand!
B00005JPAO|5.0|So what's this then? A biography of HRH?<br /><br />Good heavens, no. She's been on the throne now for more than half a century. Where would a filmmaker begin? Besides, she looks like she's still got years of service ahead of her. Where would a fimmaker end? And with the greatest respect to Her Majesty, I really don't think a movie about her life would have quite the same draw. No, this interesting study, written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Frears, centres on the turbulent times - certainly for the monarchy - following on from the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.<br /><br />Ah, yes. I remember those days well<br /><br />Don't we all? I'll never forget that morning on August 31st 1997. I'd been at a house party with some friends and after a totally fun night of dancing to anything from Notorious B.I.G.'s \\"Hypnotize\\" to Whitney Houston's \\"I'm Every Woman\\", we all staggered out into the dawn light to hear people chatting nervously, almost fearfully, about something. Princess Diana has been seriously hurt in an accident in Paris, someone eventually said out loud in shocked disbelief. Stunned, we all got into the car and immediately turned on the radio to hear that it was true. By the time I finally made it home and turned on the TV, her death had already been confirmed.<br /><br />So, a documentary then?<br /><br />Well, not quite, though this fantastic movie is almost documentary-like, with its well placed news clips, presented and voiced by broadcasters we all know and respect here in the UK. In actuality, it is part recent history and part clever speculation. Its main focus seems to be the gross miscalculation made by the royal family immediately following the tragedy. They seemed very remote, very aloof and while we see actual footage of world leaders like Presidents Clinton and Mandela were making public statements of grief and shock in this movie, Queen Elizabeth II and her family remain resolutely silent.<br /><br />As you mentioned earlier, it wasn't a good time for the monarchy.<br /><br />No, it definitely wasn't. The monarchy's popularity in Britain plummeted to its lowest levels in centuries in the autumn of 1997, while conversely, Tony Blair, the freshly minted prime minister came out of it all smelling of roses. By 2002 though, when the Queen celebrated her Golden Jubilee, it seems her subjects had forgiven her. Maybe we saw the big picture and were not going to allow one mistake, no matter how big, to obliterate 50 years of outstanding and selfless service. Or maybe, in this tabloid media driven age of fickle celebrity, we've just developed much shorter memories. Whatever.<br /><br />So who's in it then?<br /><br />Ah, yes, of course. Well, Helen Mirren gives the performance of a lifetime as The Queen and after years of admiring her work, I'm so happy to see her finally get her due: Golden Globe, Bafta and Oscar. She graciously said it was The Queen that people were honouring but we all know it was her performance as The Queen and her incredible talent in general. Martin Sheen carries off the role of Tony Blair pretty amazingly as well, even though the resemblance is fleeting at best. James Cromwell - remember him from \\"Six Feet Under\\"? - does a remarkable impression of Prince Philip and don't forget to check out Helen McCrory as Cherie Blair. She doesn't seem to be a huge fan of the Royal family, does she? (Of course, as I mentioned earlier, most of this movie is pure speculation).<br /><br />But we were all there at the time. It was almost ten years ago. What's the huge attraction now?<br /><br />I think that is what makes this movie so fascinating. For me anyway. It's about a time in recent history that I lived through and still remember quite clearly. I didn't go as far as some did, with all their weeping, wailing and shaking outside Kensington Palace but I was very sad about Diana's death.<br /><br />But most crucial of all, I think, this movie is sympathetic towards the Queen and shows us a (possible) side to her that we never get to see. Helen Mirren plays her with great warmth and depth and we see, probably for the first time, just why she may have reacted in the way that she did back then. The entire movie suggests a side to the story that we weren't privy to and probably never will be and I think that's why the movie went down a storm here in the UK. It also reminds us how we all lost the plot for a minute back there in September of 1997. That's the fun part - being able to see something and shout: Oh, I remember that! What were we thinking? The good old days.<br /><br />As for why Americans have taken to it, I can only speculate. Royalty has always been something of a fascination for our cousins and remember that this tale of The Queen is circled by or entangled with somewhat, the story of Diana, a woman who still enthrals on both sides of the Atlantic even now, 10 years after her untimely death. I saw a 2-hour special about Princess Diana's life on the Biography channel recently. Even though I was relatively familiar with the story, I was still gripped from beginning to end.

0618680004|5.0|A lot of thought went into this book, it is well organized, well written, never boring and no, it is not antagonistic or offensive. Dawkins uses reason, logic and scientific method to tackle this touchy subject. A good book for all of us, especially those who always thought that religion is fundamentally flawed but lacked the proper arguments to articulate that view even to themselves. One of the many good suggestions in the book is his relabeling of \\"atheists\\" as \\"brights\\", kind of like homosexuals started to calling themselves \\"gay\\" in the seventies. So, count me in as a \\"bright\\" from now on.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I wouldn't go as far as describing this movie as the \\"Best Bond Ever\\" but it is certainly one of my favourites. And I've seen them all.<br /><br />Daniel Craig had his doubters right from the minute it was announced that he was to take the role of 007, especially in the UK tabloid press. I personally couldn't work out what all the fuss was about (though one rumour suggested, completely ridiculously, that it was because he is blond and has blue eyes). I'd only ever seen him in one other role, in Steven Spielberg's [[ASIN:B000F1IQN2 Munich (Widescreen Edition)]] and I thought he did a pretty decent job in that. I remember thinking at the time, let's give the dude a chance. Maybe he'll pull it off.<br /><br />Well, pull it off he did and while (sadly) there'll never be another Connery or Moore, or (thankfully), another Dalton or Brosnan, and while I accept that Craig might not have the smooth charm of any of his predecessors, he is edgier, grittier and much more believable than any of them as an agent in Her Majesty's secret spy service, MI6. This is definitely a 21st century Bond. He relies much more on his licence to kill than on smooth talking the ladies or on fancy gadgets (there's no Moneypenny or even a Q in this one) and when he does kill, he does it with a ruthless efficiency.<br /><br />This is an action packed thriller - the opening free running scenes with parkour supremo S&eacute;bastien Foucan alone are worth the price of the DVD - with most of the tension centred round a poker game played at the Casino that gives the movie its name. Judi Dench is her usual awesome self as M and I would say that Isaach De Bankole as the deadly Steven Obanno is also worth watching out for. The premise of this whole movie is that it takes place before Bond is ever given \\"00\\" status and I suppose that to make that premise authentic, the movie should've been based in the late 50s or early 60s or something but I'm not complaining. Period dramas never did it for me anyway. Purists may have anxieties about this new Bond, most especially about his raw brutality, but everything has to move on eventually.<br /><br />I say hats off to Daniel Craig for reinventing a role that was in danger of going stale. Bond may be a bit more politically correct (see his romance with Eva Green's Treasury Officer Vesper Lynd) but again, these are the times we live in.is new Bond, most especially about his raw brutality, but everything has to move on eventually.

B000MCH5P4|2.0|Throughout this movie, I kept having the thought, \\"What's the point, here?\\"  There were supposed to be three or four different cultures portrayed here, all tied to one another in a tragical way.  But, so many scenes were entirely unnecessary. <br /> <br />(SPOILERS) <br />It was unnecessary to show a young boy masturbating, this had absolutely nothing to do with the film, and, if anything, was disturbing and perverted. <br /> <br />It was unnecessary to show the entire point of view of the undersexed (though, still a virgin), deaf-mute, asian girl whose father supposedly started the chain of events.  Her entire part in the movie was boring and had NOTHING to do with the story. <br /> <br />It was unnecessary to show Amelia (the children's keeper), have a makeout session at the party following the marriage.  And what point did the marriage have in this movie, for that matter? <br /> <br />This movie was ridiculous and pointless, not to mention, hard to follow. Don't waste your money! <br />

B000N4SHPS|3.0|While it's completely unrealistic that a 60-something ex-champ could fight competitively with a 20-something current champ, Rocky Balboa turns out to be quite a good movie.  Rocky is back in his old hard scrabble neighborhood dealing with the facts of aging, the death of his beloved wife, and his estrangement from his son.  When a computer generated match between Rocky and current champ Mason Dixon touts that Rocky was the better boxer, Dixon's management stages an exhibition match between the two boxers.  Rocky accepts despite some thinking his crazy to do so. <br /> <br />Rocky Balboa is true to the original movie and evokes a lot of nostalgia.  The writers did an outstanding job of living up to the theme of the original Rocky - the underdog who through heart and courage exceeds expectations.  It is a fitting end to the Rocky saga and a surprisingly enjoyable movie given the silliness of last few Rocky movies.
B000O75F7C|4.0|They're back!  Short concept album with the same clever songwriting and characteristic sound SW/PT have been putting out lately.  Compared to all the other bands out there, this is an excellent and interesting release.  It only disappoints compared to Porcupine  Tree's OWN catalogue.   I've been listening to this for the past 3 days, now, and decided it's my fifth favorite Porcupine Tree (after Deadwing, In Absentia, Stupid Dream and Signify).   <br /> <br />Most of it sounds like an extension of \\"Deadwing\\" - as if there were songs left over.  Except for \\"Anesthetize\\", which sounds like Radiohead and Dream Theatre had a baby.  The drumming on \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" is perhaps the best yet (can't wait to see the songs played live).  <br /> <br />Lyrics are bleak and ominous, with artwork to match.  Unsmiling children, shining screens, piles of pills, drab cityscapes, abandoned playthings.  Captures adolescent isolation and detachment in a very relevant way.  <br /> <br />Conceptually, Fear of a Blank Planet holds together much better than Deadwing.  Yes, Deadwing had more highlights, more grandiose gestures, more sustained \\"oomph\\"...  But too much of that would have contradicted the lyrical theme of FOABP.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I was very reluctant to see this movie having suffered through the last two sequels.  I must say that I was surprised by this film which was actually quite good.  The film managed to recapture the feel of the original film with a now \\"old\\" Rocky, mourning his wife constantly while trying to mend fences with his son.  He is the owner of a restaurant and lets his old sparring partner Spider Rico eat there for free until Spider decides he needs to earn his keep and voluntarily begins working in the restaurant. <br /> <br />Rocky meets up with the troubled young lady who he had walked home in the first movie.  She is now a middle-aged single mom tending bar.  Rocky takes a liking to her teenaged son right away and seems to like her too but Adrian's memories keep getting in the way. <br /> <br />Of course what is a Rocky film without a bout?  In this one Antonio Tarver puts in an excellent performance as Mason Dixon, a champion with nobody worthy to fight.  Since there are no valid opponents for him, he cannot get a pay-per-view big money fight going.  His promoter and manager get intrigued by a computerized fight between Dixon and Rocky and feel that if they could talk both fighters into getting into the ring for real, they can have the big money fight they were looking for. <br /> <br />The movie does not make any pretensions like some of the other Rocky films.  Rocky's trainer tells Rocky that the only thing that he can do is train himself so that any punch he lands will put a hurting on Dixon and may teach him some humility.   <br /> <br />The fight in itself is not bad and in the end, Dixon may become a more \\"polished\\" fighter with a better reputation because of it. <br />
4893580914|5.0|I just started learning Japanese....oh, about 2 weeks ago. I had no trouble learning Hiragana and Katakana, but as I'm sure you already know, the Kanji seems to be nearly impossible. Well, this book pretty much solves everything. <br />It starts you out with the simplest Kanji and only builds each section off of previous knowledge. It is well laid out with thoughtful planning and it never eases up. I really have no idea how they managed it, but the book really immerses you in the Kanji and makes it so easy to remember with some of the best drills I've seen.  <br /> <br />If you plan on learning Japanese, forget all of the other Kanji workbooks because this one is really the only one you need. I would also suggest getting the whole series because they are all built off of this first book. <br /> <br />I used this book about a week before I started taking my Japanese classes and to say that the beginning of class was easy due to the things this book taught me would be a great understatement.  <br />
B000O178BY|5.0|this is good ****. many may not agree, but yz has had the same effect that tool's lateralus did on me. there's alot of thought and passion put into this one. seems like more than just a music album... and its one of those things that if i actually tried to describe it in words on here i'd probably sound like an idiot. but i'm sure most of you know what i mean. this is my first, and probably last, review on amazon but i just had to put this one out there.   buy it, ....., lay back, and enjoy.

B0000028M7|5.0|Alice In Chains...they were a band millions of people admired because they never got caught up in the quagmire of nu-metal junk. FACELIFT was the birth of the metallic side of the Seattle sound, and after it went gold months after its release, Alice In Chains followed themselves up with the more melodic and less explosive SAP, the ep which surprised many fans already built on the hugely metal-grunge sound the band had under its belt. But nobody expected the groups follow-up, the bleak and monstrous DIRT to become an unexpected turn of events for the band. But there's so many reasons why DIRT became such a hit. <br /> <br />First of all, vocalist Layne Staley's bleak lyrical portraits of drug addiction and isolation are given life with his aching and haunting vocal performance all over this album, and Jerry Cantrell's guitar work is disorienting and his riffs dip and rip throughout, all the while the throbbing bass of Mike Starr and the frenetic drumwork of Sean Kinney pulse as the sturdy backbone to the music. This is the work of a true unit of Seattle musicians who have built together one of the best grunge-metal albums of the 90s...period. <br /> <br />\\"Them Bones\\" hammers home with some chugging riffs and Staley's haunting drone to open the set like a ten ton wall of bricks coming at you. Then you have the relentless thunder of the angry fight song \\"Dam That River\\" (which guitarist Jerry Cantrell wrote about an altercation between him and Kinney). Then we go into the beautiful metalscape of \\"Rain When I Die\\", which features an ending that fades out and then comes back full blast at the end, but it's a haunting song as well. Then it all changes with the beautifully aching \\"Down In A Hole\\" which is by far one of the most heartfelt performances from Staley and Cantrell. Then you go into the kinetic and pulse-pounding monster \\"Sickman\\" that features a dramatic breakdown inbetween the two throbbing verses. Then it starts to turn into a hugely operatic show from theseguys with two of biggest songs on the record. <br /> <br />\\"Rooster\\", written in tribute to Cantrell's father who served time in Vietnam, is a stunning portrayal of an armyman's time in such a place (got my pills 'gainst mosquito death/my buddy's breathing his dying breath). \\"Rooster\\" climaxes many times with its giant, crashing chorus and it's aching beginning and end. For all of its six minutes, you won't take your ears away as you are sucked into its melodrama. A very strong number that's instantly memorable. Then, out of nowhere, \\"Rooster's\\" melodrama is blown to bits by the starkly confessional drug anthem \\"Junkhead\\", which depicts Staley's harrowing drug addiction to a lethal degree. It's one of the most confessional drug songs ever written by Staley with a powerful depiction. <br /> <br />Elsewhere, the band keeps on chugging with blustery anthems (\\"Hate To Feel\\", \\"Dirt\\"), and then reaches it's apex with two of the best songs on DIRT to close out the set. \\"Angry Chair\\" is haunting, dark, melancholy, and somewhat explosive to a degree, but it's one of the best songs written solely by Staley. The words have a depth to them unlike many grunge-metal songs these days (\\"saw my reflection and cried/so little hope that i died\\"). It's a powerhouse song, flowing right into probably the biggest hit Alice In Chains have ever had, \\"Would?\\". \\"Would?\\" is a tribute to late Mother Love Bone singer Andrew Wood, and it features one hell of a vocal turn from Staley, especially during the chorus, but one can't forget Cantrell's haunting turn in the verses. The song pounds away until the very last notes with Staley screaming \\"If I would could you?!\\" And so ends a masterpiece record that sold millions of copies as the droves of grunge metal fans ate it up. <br /> <br />So while the next record, the vastly melodic and introspective JAR OF FLIES showed another different side to the band, DIRT holds up as the band's masterwork, with the self-titled \\"tripod\\" album coming in at a closesecond. DIRT is aching, revealing, dramatic, bleak, hopeless, dark, painful, but most of all, DIRT is pure beauty from the inside out.
B000O178BY|5.0|No question Trent is a genius, and Year Zero puts him right back where he belongs- At the top of his Genre.<br /><br />It truly seems that he has grown past the almost monotonous dark anxiety quality of song and lyrics that haunt his imitators and had him previously sounding like a parody of himself as on \\"With Teeth\\" and instead transcended to a higher, more universal plateau with Year Zero.<br /><br />It might be a negative to his following to say he's grown up, but...<br /><br />Yet the music has never been more intriguing and elevates him to the top of Industrial once again.<br /><br />Year Zero, to me, is his masterpiece.  It kicks, it screams, it shows Trent is back in form and better than he has ever been.<br /><br />One of the best albums this year, by far.
0440238609|4.0|These are books for all ages.  I remember tying to find the third book in this series and the Librarian giving me a funny look while saying \\"you know its in the juvenile section.\\"  Maybe this was written for children, but it isn't exactly Dr. Suess either.  I might be 27 but I enjoyed these books immensily.  It took me away to a magical world and a journey of emotions that few books have.  I intend to read these stories to my daughter when she is old enough to understand them.  I would recommend this book to anyone 8 years old to 100 years old.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|It really wasn't great. It was a good movie. The story wasn't surprising as you knew the entire time what would happen. The special effects were kind of annoying. If the tricks were supposed to be real couldn't they make them real? It would have been really cool to see his props actually be real. Why does Hollywood do special effect when a real model would look much better? It was a good movie... it just wasn't \\"great\\". Three stars is a good movie. It's good.
0316113077|5.0|I'd been eagerly awaiting the release of this book and it was so worth the wait.  As previously stated by another reviewer, there are cake, cookie and cupcake projects for all levels which is great if you're just starting out.  I love that the recipes are given in weights guaranteeing perfect results everytime.  the book is filled with tons of photos to guide those of us that tend to lean toward visual learning and very specific instructions on how to do each project.  She also provides templates for the cookie designs she uses in her book so we can replicate her cookies without necessarily having to go out to buy another cutter. <br /> <br />This book is a great learning tool for decorators of all levels!
B000O178BY|4.0|I just listened to this on my ITunes today, and I played it in complete sequence, one track after the other. I believe this is the way this particular album deserves to be listened to. Let it be known, this is, to me, Nine Inch Nails best CD to date - even besting the debut \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", which remained one of my favorite rock albums for years before Fiona Apple released \\"When the Pawn\\" (which is a rock album, nuff said).<br /><br />Like Tori Amos' \\"Scarlets' Walk\\", this CD zones in one place and time and makes you think about action, consequence, and solution. I found this riveting. Even though you may not find anything in common between this CD and Tori's `Walk', the similarities screamed out to me upon first listen. Musically, they are varied, but the mind its coming from is in the same place, I think.<br /><br />What I especially liked is the questioning of fascism, socialism, oppression, democracy and the concept of extinction, all on one record (read the lyrics - its all there). What concept Trent originally had for this is questionable, but its an amalgamation of all things. In a nutshell, it asks you whether the year 2022 is the year you think it will be, based on what the world is going through right now. Once you answer that, it asks you what you'd like to do to achieve the utopia that the year could be. However, I also got the distinct impression that Trent has decided that Year Zero is definitely going to be an End Year, where Armageddon finally comes and blows us out of the water.<br /><br />Each listener will no doubt get different things from this album. Any album that can do that in my opinion, is great. I'd suggest listening to this CD and Tori's aforementioned album side by side, or one after another. A surreal experience to be sure, and one you should definitely repeat!<br /><br />Four Stars. An instant masterpiece no doubt, but Trent could have done much better outlining his concept. On the plus side, it can be anything you want it to be, so theres a gift.it to be, so theres a gift.
B00000JPYD|5.0|One of the best hard rock albums of all time. Need I say more.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|Wow.<br /><br />What can one say about \\"Babel\\", the sort of preposterous big-budget 'world' cinema that Hollywood insists on making these days (wasn't the pathetic \\"Crash\\" enough for them?).<br /><br />Perhaps the worst thing about this misguided enterprise is that it stars the newly `world-conscious' Mr. Pitt as the headline star. Please watch this film. What exactly does Brad Pitt do here except simper and mope like a little girl? This is `acting'? Which joke of a professional reviewer dared call this Brads' `best performance'? I was thoroughly displayed by the disgusting display of Brad Pitts' `acting skills' here, and the directors lovingly focused on his `tortured emotions' as he came to terms with his wife's shooting. I mean, if one thing sinks `Babel', its Pitt. Its not like I hate him or anything (`Interview with the Vampire' was stupendous) but what he does here is criminal - as he takes centerstage in a film he first of all has no business being in.<br /><br />The story is about many parallel lives on various continents all interconnecting in the end to make you go `Aha! I never saw THAT coming!', but you dear viewer, deserve far better than the supposed `goodies' this film has to offer. Maybe I should just write this entire review in `air quotes'. Seriously. Let me count the storylines. This will be good:<br /><br />1. Brad and Cate : Two people in Morocco vacationing to save their obviously dead-in-the-ground marriage (and considering Pitts' face here, its no wonder she doesn't want anything to do with him). They're in a bus, she gets shot, and the rest of the movie follows Brads' attempts to find help for her in a rural area and to prevent her death. Oh boo hoo hoo.<br /><br />2. Brad and Cate's children & their Nanny : Back in the US, their children's nanny comes up with this amazing idea to take the kids across the border for her daughters' wedding (which is probably the most boring Hispanic wedding I've ever seen - they are far more vibrant than this one, in real life). Gael Garcia Bernal (who gives his role far more depth than this film deserved) plays the guy who takes them across the border. On the way back, La Americano Immigrationo stops them and the kids and nanny are lost in the desert, also at deaths' door.<br /><br />3. In Japan, an obviously sexually deprived teenager looks for love in all the wrong places because of some sordid back-story involving her mothers' suicide. We are supposed to `feel her pain', but the only thing I felt was how low this character would stoop to get some action. I mean, really. The Japanese actress was fine, but anyone could have sleepwalked through this excuse of a role. There is the sub-story of a Japanese police officer, but this storyline is too inconsequential to detail here. Pass.<br /><br />4. The Moroccan Kids : Two Moroccan kids get a hold of a rifle and they're the ones that shot Cate from a distance. One kid ends up dying and the other realizes the errors of his ways. Oh wow. I am on my knees praying to the Lord already. What a message!<br /><br />And heres the shocker. All these stories converge into one point at the end. Just like Manoj Shyamalan's surprise endings of late (and you know what I mean), the shock here is that the gun the kids shot Cate with, used to belong to the Japanese girls' father!! Oh my!! Isn't that exciting!!<br /><br />Not.<br /><br />Which is exactly why this ludicrous waste of film does not get my vote. I have had it with films that set you up for a payoff and then suddenly the end credits roll. As a student of world cinema, I find this to be very `Hollywood' in the worst sort of way. Its no wonder this was shut out at the Oscars because even though it has some pretty music and cinematography, it has NO soul. And that is so evident.<br /><br />The worst part of the film was a ten minute long sequence where the Japanese girl meets some boys, takes some `pills', gets drunk, saunters into a nightclub, and then leaves. Seriously. Ten Minutes of this non-stop nonsense parading as `serious art'. Oh yeah, shes deaf and dumb too, but that doesn't stop her does it? Oh no! At the end of the film, the movie hints at the girls' suicide attempt, but we are not even given this visual delight. Instead the film ends with a numbing visual of the girl, naked, hugging her father on her terrace. Dubious to say the least, and nothing was resolved.<br /><br />If you love this movie, I'm sorry. You're probably in the majority. However, I did not like this. It was a waste of time, and took my intelligence for granted. I hear the word `masterpiece' being thrown around, and that is definitely not true. This is a C Grade movie dressed up in an A+ costume. To me, the only worthy thing about this was Gael Garcia Bernal who is good in literally everything he is in. Watch it for him, if you must, but take my advice and skip this. There are so many great movies about cultural integration around us - lets not forget that this film focuses on the travails of a WHITE family and that the entire story revolves around them. Whatever `world unity' they wanted to portray was lost a long time ago.<br /><br />Two Stars. Not recommended.club, and then leaves. Seriously.

0226264211|5.0|This was my first economics book, and I have been fascinated with political economy and political philosophy ever since.  Friedman has always appealed to me because his libertarianism is grounded in pragmatism instead of a dogmatic idealism.  Unlike many of the reviewers, I prefer this book to his later work (Free to Choose) because it delves into the philosophy behind his political economy.
B000O178BY|1.0|Ive been a NineInchNails fan since i bought Pretty Hate Machine in 89. This is NOT a good album. at best, it's background music for when you are doing something else. there is nothing about it that will stick in your head after you turn it off other than how poor it really was. The whole album sounds like a collection of crappy b-sides that didn't make the last album. I wont try and convince myself to like it like some others seem to have done.  that this could be rated higher than \\"With teeth\\" makes me think the rating system is useless. Save your money and if you are a fan save yourself the dissapointment you will feel after having heard it.  <br /> <br /> Those of you giving it 4-5 stars need to really ask yourselves: would you  rate it that high if it was put out by someone you don't like or are you just saying it's great because it says nin on the front?
1582701709|5.0|The theme throughout the volume focuses on transitioning from the formulation of an idea or concept through actualization by utilizing<br />the power of positive thinking. Negativity only gets in the way of progress by blocking creativity and leading to depressive modes of behavior and ultimately bad outcomes. In addition, the book provides a considerable argument on how to break out of negativity through relaxation and imagination.<br /><br />The author demonstrates how frequent contemplation of our goals will lead to creative strategies to reach them in an iterative process of<br />experimentation. The presentation covers another important aspect which impacts on whether or not we can help people. That is, we must have a positive image of ourselves. Otherwise, it will be more difficult to help others.<br /><br />In many respects, this is the stuff of great thinkers, inventors and social reformers. A beauty of this book is that the author sets forth the conditions for \\"positivity\\" to grow and flourish. A weakness of the<br />presentation is that meritable goals require considerable effort to<br />guide the idea from the initial inspiration to ultimate achievement.<br />In some respects, the author gives an unrealistic impression ; such that,<br />imagining a goal leads to some instant attainment of it. Goal attainment<br />can be a complex process which requires time, effort and the active involvement of strategic constituencies of people. Very often, simple goals<br />are easily reached. More difficult goals require a higher level of<br />commitment described earlier.<br /><br />Other books; such as, SUPERLEARNING by Ostrander teach relaxation modes<br />as a condition precedent to advanced learning . This work is reinforced by dozens of quotations from famous persons in various contexts throughout history. In order to reach a goal, the author states that we need to imagine ourselves doing it in an iterative process leading to a successful result. Many times, we can facilitate reaching a difficult goal by imagining it first and tracing through the myriad of steps necessary to achieve success.<br /><br />In some respects, Mrs. Sullivan utilized these techniques in training<br />Helen Keller to overcome the hopelessness of her situation. This was accomplished by associating words with concrete concepts in a carefully contrived series of encounters marked by a complex interplay of rewards and punishments. For example, Helen Keller learned to associate liquid water<br />with rudimentary speech; such as \\"wah-wah\\". This successful association<br />lead to greater and greater positivity and ultimately to progressive<br />language acquisition. The encounters transformed Helen Keller's personality<br />from bouts of sporatic neurosis to a more unified and tranquil human being.<br /><br />A book of this nature would be very helpful in today's world. It provides<br />a step-by-step roadmap on how to overcome a variety of negations in our<br />everyday local lives and in the greater macro-community of this world.<br />There is certainly much negativity to overcome in the world at large.<br /><br />Few authors address the consequence of extreme negativity with specific<br />steps to break loose from this cycle of hopelessness and destructive<br />self-perpetuation/absorbtion.This work can lead to scenarios where we can articulate solutions to the most complex problems.

B000H5V8DG|5.0|But seriously this is a cool pack. All 5 series tons of extras and some not in the separate set. Plus a book on it all..... no really this is good more than worth the money take it from someone who imported it from the UK cos our version is keek... Yeah customs sucks
0385333846|3.0|Perhaps I missed the boat, but \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" just doesn't come across as hilarious and eye-opening as many see it in my opinion.  Sure, there's no denying Vonnegut's satirical viewpoint, but the story is just too disjointed and jumbled to really enjoy it.  Vonnegut uses Billy Pilgrim to get his point across that war isn't worth it.  In a perfect world, we wouldn't need war.  However, there comes a point when shaking hands and talking over tea just doesn't work anymore.  It's obvious that Vonnegut disagreed with the actions taken at Dresden (He was there), but he fails to mention the reasoning behind the attack on that particular place.  Also, he gives us a brief glimpse at conditions in the German concentration camps but fails to fully paint the picture of just how cruel these places were.  In short, what you have here is one man's viewpoint of warfare.  If you agree with him, you'll probably think his sarcastic remarks are hilarious.  However, if, like me, you see war as an unwanted but sometimes necessary evil, you may tire of Vonnegut's lingo rather quickly.<br /><br />In closing I must say that this book just wasn't for me.  When I was in college I happened to see the film that's based on this book and I actually enjoyed it.  Perhaps age and real world experience have rubbed the sand out of my eyes and I now see this book for what it really is?  I'm not saying that this book is bad, but I won't recommend everybody go out and read it either.
B000O174CM|3.0|I sat down to watch \\"Dreamgirls\\" after months (which in turn seem like years) of huge media attention, including the much hyped victory of co-star Jennifer Hudson at the Oscars and the Golden-Globes. So after a while that I hadn't watched a musical (it goes back as far as 2002's \\"Chicago\\"), I was quite enthralled. After all, a critically acclaimed film boasting Hollywood luminaries such as Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy and Beyonce Knowles can not go wrong, right? wrong. The first thing that popped into my mind half way through the film, is why the hell Hudson has to burst into song every time she tells someone off. We got the idea that it's a musical but her sudden shrieking was totally out of place and detracted rather than added. Secondly, Eddie Murphy is a brilliant actor, and though I understand he only had a supporting role, I felt his part was a bit underplayed. His moments on the screen were the highlights of the movie and his role could have been upped just a bit. And last but not least, have you noticed how everything turns OK all at once, just before the movie ends? (Effie gets Curtis off her back, Deena leaves Curtis, Curtis learns he has a daughter). That said, the movie does have its share of good drama (Effie's told she's being relegated to sing back up for Deena - come on, you can't be that cold-hearted not to feel sorry for her), fine acting (again, Murphy delivers great acting as usual and Hudson as well; that is, up until she starts trilling) and (the film) is a feast for the eyes. As for Miss Knowles, I couldn't help but giggle when I remembered how she used her real-life group members to model her clothing-line on the Oprah Winfrey show. I couldn't decide what's worse. All in all, though the film is not without its flaws, it's worth watching and is enjoyable throughout. Just don't expect too much and don't be fooled by the hype. Enjoy.
0780623703|5.0|I love this film.  It has a sweetness, a wistfulness, about it that is  so compelling, yet explores many complex human issues, including individual rights.  The writing is fabulous - so when I read that the writer of \\"Pleasantville\\" is the same man who wrote \\"Big\\", it all made clicked.  This movie received so little notice that when I loan it to friends their reply is always the same:  why didn't I know about this great movie?
B000N6U0E2|4.0|3.5 stars.  Don't get me wrong this is a good film, but...for me (in this medium) it was trying too hard and dragged the rags to riches plot out for way too long.  I realize this is based off a true story.  However, I wished the screenwriter would have given the script a few more peaks or breaks from the unrelenting obstacles Chris Gardner faces; especially if the payoff was going to be so short.  After going through this fire with Mr. Gardner, we're only rewarded with three minutes of elation and a placard telling us he went on to be a multi-millionaire.  I feel emotionally short-changed.  I mean we don't even see how much the job went on to pay him.  However, Chris Gardner's story will make the people who are settling for mediocre re-evaluate.  Movie's best line:  'If you want something, go after it.  Period.'<br /><br />Overall: Recommended.
B00005QXDD|4.0|Say what you will about The D, but when it comes to writing short 1 minute songs about one's own awesomery they cannot be beat. Songs like Tribute and Kyle Quit The Band are hardly 2 minutes but will have you humming them the rest of the day. The catchy melodies and hilarious lyrics make this just one sweet mix of folk, comedy, and rock. Although, there is alot of swearing Jack Black is one of those rare people who can swear all day but never offend. He has a fun, jovial tone that makes his F-bombs seem enjoyable rather than tawdry. Check this out if you have any curousity in the mystery that is Tecacious D.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I had just acquired this awesome new series concerning Planet Earth by the star narrator  and producer - David Attenbourough * who should have been awarded  a Noble Prize in Nature Conservation...! To date, David has produced more than half a dozen of serialized documentaries on wildlife of the world and all of them are highly educational and bear a powerful  message - Nature Conservation of our land, animals and plant life in all their beauty...before they become extinct. <br />The current documentary is David's latest on PLANET EARTH which comprises of 5 DVD discs on almost 9 solid hours of viewing and  what has  happened on our Blue Planet. <br />Ironically and in view of the global warming and the dire warnings, these documentries could perhaps be the last visual recording that  we would see nature before it is gone forever. <br />At this affordable price, the set of documentaries would be just  a bargain. So go for it while they last. <br />David's present documentary could  be the last salute to Planet Earth and our next generation and generations  to come might not see and enjoy what we do now, friends. <br />Please don't let me alarm you, but at the rate our Planet Earth is being abused, I wouldn't be surprised that  it could not  hold out much longer...the point of no return has been reached!!!  <br />Thanks to Mr. David Attenborough and his BBC camera team for such revealing pictures of our PLANET EARTH. <br />Cheers...!
B000I5YCCO|4.0|Taylor Swift is a great singer and songwriter and she's only 17!  This girl has a long career in front of her and I intend to pay attention to the ride.  She demands as much with my favorite \\"Just Another Picture To Burn.\\"
B000O178BY|4.0|When I read in the paper that NIN's was already putting out a new album, I was more or less stunned, even excited--being such a big fan of \\"With_Teeth\\" and \\"The Fragile\\".  While \\"Year Zero\\" lacks the high quality of both those works, it's worth the modest sticker price.  For me, it's not cohesive enough to work as a concept album.  Besides, there's something about much of it that strikes me as being superficial.  I think \\"Year Zero\\" needed another year of work.   <br />  It's starts off promisingly enough, with \\"Hyperpower\\", which vaguely reminds me of the oddly placed \\"Pilgrimage\\" of \\"The Fragile\\".  The next number, \\"The Beginning of the End\\", is catchy, if lyrically weak.  Then we have \\"Survivalism\\", a tough, sarcastic, clever glossing over of the decline of American (or Western, it you prefer) culture, not to mention, the continual raping of Mother Nature.  Next: \\"The Good Soldier\\" is a mellow-sounding tune, rather at odds with its lyrics--which leads us to what may be Reznor's worst song ever--\\"Vessel\\".  I can only describe it as being a parody of what it should have been, and a tool for making \\"Me, I'm Not\\" a blessed relief.  \\"Capital G\\" should have been called \\"Capital Me\\", because it makes me think of myself--nor do I care to picture President Bush while I'm listening to music.  Then there are the next six songs... Finally, we come to the much-welcomed \\"Another Version of the Truth\\", a haunting and lovely piano tune.  \\"In This Twilight\\" is #15, and quite dreamy, in a good way.  \\"Zero Sum\\" contains some prophetic whispering and a solid chorus extolling us to give way to shame \\"for all we've done\\".  (I'll pass.)   <br />  I wanted to like this  better than I do, but I can't.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|I thoroughly loved this Harley Davidson action special effects movie. As usual, Nicholas Cage is the great American Hero and the cameo actors were a special treat for us baby boomers. A real feel good movie. I am pre-ordering the Extended Cut DVD right this minute and hoping this DVD has lots of \\"the making of.\\" If you love lots of action, Spielberg-like special effects, motorcycles and Nicholas Cage, you will love this DVD....
B00008DDXC|4.0|The second film adaptation of J.K. Rowling's immensely popular seven-novel series (which will come to a close with July's release of \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\"), the film is a bit weaker, when compared to the first film and the following two. Certainly, as a movie by itself, it entertains thoroughly and like with the other films, will both entertain adults and kids equally. <br /> <br />The main problem that is struck here is its undying faithfulness to the book -- we see bits like The Deathday Party omitted, minor details and some scenes are shortened for the film, but otherwise a good chunk of the storyline is maintained from the book. Partly attributed to that is director Chris Columbus, who must've pressured returning screenwriter Steven Kloves to be as faithful to the novel without taking many liberties with it. And that's fine and while the movie entertains, one feels that had it been more streamlined and less faithful to the novel, it would've been more satisfying cinematically. <br /> <br />Otherwise, everything else is top-notch. The returning actors successfully return to their roles they made their own in the first installment -- Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint show signs of aging (the boys' voices are getting deeper, for example) but are aging just enough to keep pace with the films. The adult actors deliver first-rate performances but again don't shadow the kids, who take center stage in the movies. Newcomers such as Shirley Henderson (a 40-year old woman playing the ghost of a teenage girl), Jason Issacs, and Christian Coulson dig into their roles with gusto. Unfortunately, this was Sir Richard Harris's final role as Dumbledore, who died shortly before the film's premiere (and the role was subsequently re-cast as Michael Gambon in the following films). The technical aspects are superb, with luscious cinematography and production design by Roger Pratt and Stuart Craig respectively, with John Williams again providing a spectacular score. In short, if your kids enjoy the Harry Potter books (or if you do), you will most likely enjoy this installment, as well as non-book Harry Potter fans. <br /> <br />Warner Brothers has released this film available as a 2-disc DVD (in both separate anamorphic widescreen and pan-n-scan formats) and VHS, both of which are now out of print (the DVD can still be readily found in stores). For the sake of cinemaphiles and the respect of filmmakers, I own the widescreen edition. <br /> <br />Like the rest of the Harry Potter movies, the second movie is shot in the 2.35:1 scope format, and is presented on the DVD as such with anamorphic enhancement. The picture quality is mainly excellent, with rich vibrant colors that practically leap off the screen. Black levels are well-maintained throughout and never falter, while detail is very sharp for the majority of the picture. The dark scenes (such as in Aragog's lair) looked a bit soft to me, but the rest of the disc is nicely maintained. Film grain is well-compressed and kept to a minimum, but there is some mild speckling to be found. Otherwise, the video quality comes close to being reference quality. <br /> <br />But the audio is a true stunner, presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX, encoded at a full 448 kps. The movie is bigger and louder than the first, and the audio happily follows suit. The surrounds are fully engaged throughout, particularly in the scene where Harry and Ron venture into Aragog's lair, where you can hear the spiders crawl around you with pinpoint accuracy. The dynamic range is quite wide, so make sure the volume isn't turned to maximum when you put it in, because it could blow out your surround system. The bass is meaty and thick, and it is impressive. This is a demo-quality track, if anything. (I wish WHV would've included a DTS-ES track too, but they'll probably do that for the inevitable double-dip.) An optional Spanish 5.1 EX dub is included, and the film features optional subtitles inEnglish, French and Spanish. The film is divided into 37 chapters, and the first disc also has the movie's respective theatrical trailer and cast and crew bios. <br /> <br />The second disc is still not as good or thorough as, say, \\"The Incredibles\\", but it's a big step up than the puff pieces we got for the first movie. We get a good and informative 10 minute interview with novelist J.K. Rowling and screenwriter Steven Kloves; a whopping 19 extended/deleted scenes (the scenes are presented in anamorphic video with stereo audio) which can be accessed separately or played together via the \\"play all\\" option; cast interviews with the kid and adult actors (such as the trio, the newcomers, and some of the holdovers from the previous movie); a \\"Building a Scene\\" documentary which covers the entire filmmaking process in 16 minutes (it features interviews with Chris Columbus, Roger Pratt, Stuart Craig, editor Peter Honess, composer John Williams and other tech personnel); the usual assortment of kiddie games; a gallery of production sketches; a game preview; and DVD-ROM content exclusive to this disc. <br /> <br />I recommend this disc, it's a good movie with an excellent transfer and stunning audio coupled with an okay set of supplements. Still, it's a big step up from the first movie's release in terms of extras, and the subsequent two movies have gradually gotten better extras with their DVD releases. Who knows, maybe the DVD release of \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" will finally include an audio commentary.
0393327655|5.0|This book from Sam Harris is so laden with interesting facts about religion, science, politics, etc. you need 2 bookmarks to read it. My only complaint is that I hate seeing an end note in the book, and flipping to the back to see \\"Ibid\\". I think a lot of people don't read the endnotes just because they're lazy. Sam Harris has such a wealth of knowledge back there, it's a real shame. He should have two separate sections, one for information interesting end notes, and another for mere references and endless Ibids. <br /> <br />Sam Harris makes a very convincing case about what is wrong with faith, religion, what people don't understand about morality, spirituality, etc. <br /> <br />That said, in a way this book must have been his Ph.D. thesis. If so, I should start reading more doctoral dissertations because this book rocks. It might be a little too dense for the majority of Americans, but then again the majority of Americans are fat ignorant superstitious blobs who would rather spend time watching American Idol. <br /> <br />
0140288503|5.0|I'm so upset that I watched the movie first.  In my opinion the book is 100x's better and I'm surprised to see how many story lines that they have changed.  The details just make you shake your head in shock. In the movie they didn't really mention (I can't recall) Air Force Combat Controller's.  Honestly if it wasn't for them there would have more casualties.  It's an amazing modern war story that won't put you to sleep.  I enjoyed the pictures at the end of the book.  I like to put names and faces together. <br />A great read from beginning to end.   <br />
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins is a mental giant and an amazing writer. I've read a number of his books now and am always blown away by them. [The Selfish Gene is one of the most consciousness raising books around.]. The beauty of his books is that he can explain very complex things (like evolution) in a completely sensible straightforward manner. <br /> <br />The God Delusion is an (almost) thorough look at the very concept of God itself and examines different ways of believing (on a scale of deist to atheist), including historical \\"proofs\\" for God's existence, the evolutionary origins of morality, and religion. I say almost because if Dawkins addressed Eastern religions, the book would be complete, as the focus is obviously on the judeo-christian(islam) religions. <br /> <br />I wish everyone who was brought up in religion X simply because their parents and grandparents and so on were brought up in religion X, would sit down and really think about how their life would be had they been born in a different part of the world and what their \\"faith\\" would be then. Anyone open to finding out the truth, the reality, should read this book.
B000O75F7C|3.0|Naturally , there will be those who give this album 5 stars because it is Steven Wilson . He is a progressive pioneer, so everything he does is worthy of 5 stars in the minds of some . I am sure these same people would give this album 5 stars before they even hear it . They would also show no hesitation in giving Wilson 5 stars everytime he breaks wind . With that said , this is a very fine effort by Wilson , but not without it's shortcomings . I will not allow my adulation for Wilsons body of work to hinder my ability to review this album objectively. My issues are the following .... I can't seem to shake the looming suspicion that this album was rushed . There are several contributing factors as to why this could be true . For starters , i believe there was a conscious effort on Wilsons part to capitalize on the commercial success ( commercial by thier standards ) of Deadwing . The mainstream is becoming increasingly aware of PT with each release , and Wilson wants to feed into that . Second , Wilson is always juggling several different projects simultaneously , thus he is reluctant to devote allot of time to any one project ( which does make sense ) . Although , sometimes the finshed product can suffer as a result of that approach . This is one of the shortest PT albums in recent memory , clocking in at 50 minutes . Instead of having several 7 plus minute tracks that drag . Perhaps he could have shaved off some mintes on those tracks . Making an album that would be structurally similar to Blackfield . You would have 10 tracks , with the album clocking in at around 45-50 minutes . I understand that \\" Prog Heads \\" perceive longer songs as being \\" more progressive \\" . I have never subscribed to that belief . What makes music progressive is uniqueness , and a desire to stray from the norm . Nickelback could start making ten minute songs , and that wouldn't make them progressive . I enjoy listening to long songs if they continously evolve and shift . On this album , Wilson makes long songs for the sake of making long songs , and it really wears on me sometimes . Although i thoroughly enjoyed the title track - Fear of a Blank Planet - and - Sleep Together - . Their extended lengths are warrented because they move with a sense of purpose . Out of the 6 songs on this album , i really enjoyed 3 . The rest are just tolerable , which isn't exactly the mark of a great album ( this is just my opinion ) . Anthesthetize is the ever so bloated 17 minute obligatory epic . This is an exercise in craftsmanship undoubtedly ( while also being an exercise in pretentiousness and self-celebration ) . I would say - Sentimental - is probably my favorite . In closing , i enjoyed this album , although it is not a tremendous step forward , or a step backwards for that matter . PT appears to be caught somewhere inbetween , in a state of perpetual limbo . It should be known that PT is not my favorite Wilson vehicle . I have always been more partial to Bass Communion and No-Man .
B000HWZ5WE|5.0|I bought this EP when it came out in the 80's for many it was a surprize hit. The CD remaster is great. You can hear everything very clearly. Jeff Beck's guitar solo at the end of \\"rockin at midnight\\" is vibrant. On the Ep it was faded out. Just a warning, Robbie Blunt is only on the live version and, this is not his first collab' with Mr. Plant despite what it says above. Hey, who ever thought old stuff could sound relevent?
B00005JPCF|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it kept me laughing all the way through.  The penguins were so cute, especially when they danced.  I don't understand why a lot of people said they didn't enjoy it, I liked it so much I bought it on dvd.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Everything you remember is here: Peter Pan, the Lost Boys, Captain Hook, and the ticking crocodile. But this isn't the Peter Pan you though you knew. Previous adaptations highlight childhood as an ideal time of innocence and play. Those elements are very much in place here but there are also darker elements of danger, fear, and even the begining of sexuality. In other words- it presents a realistic vision of childhood within the context of a fantasy.  <br /> <br />We open in London where the Banks children are told stories of Peter Pan and Neverland. But things are changing. Aunt Millicent points out that the eldest of the Darlings, Wendy, is approaching adulthood and should begin thinking about marriage. Peter Pan on the other hand is the boy who never changes and new grows up. But that also means that he's perpetually on the brink of puberty. In Wendy he finds a maternal figure that he and the Lost Boys crave, but also a budding love interest. The kiss between them is far from a thimble.  That's not to say that there is any overt sexuality here. Peter and Wendy are very much innocent children in that regard but there in the hint of it being a possibility someday. Captain Hook is representative of all our childhood fears. He's far more menacing than his Disney counterpart but never so scarey that kids can't handle it. The pirates and mermaids also have a degree of menace but it's something that children can face in order to conquer. Overall this isn't a simplistic, idealized view of childhood but rather a depiction of childhood as a time of magic, innocence, fun, fear, and anticipation of the future. <br /> <br />The special effects and CGI are visually wonderful and gives us a more believeable Neverland. It's still a fantasy but we are able to believe in it for the duration of the film. The suspension of disbelief that the film requires (in older viewers at least) is aided by fine performances all around. Jeremy Sumpter is mischivous and cute, and slightly obnoxious at times as the title character and Rachel Hurd-Wood is beautiful, adventurous and lively as Wendy. Ludavine Sangier is comic and slightly homicidal as Tinkerbell and Jason Isaacs steals his scenes in a dual role as Captain Hook and Mr. Darling. <br /> <br />Usually a \\"family film\\" means something adults have to sit through while kids enjoy it. This is one of the few films that truely does provide enjoyment and even a little insight for both the young and old.
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|Before I go any further, allow me to make this clear: I am a die-hard Trekkie who grew up on the original series episodes and has come to love TNG as well, so I mean to call it like I see it. <br /> <br />I don't wish to give away any plot elements, but in order to adequately review the movie, I must make some minor \\"spoilers.\\" This film highlights one of the ethical dilemmas that has come to be a hallmark of Star Trek since its inception. In a move rather similar to that of President Jackson in relocating the Southeastern Native American tribes, Starfleet officials in league with a shady group of aliens conspire to remove a primitive people from their world so that Federation citizens may reap the benefits of an unusual healing radiation emenating from the rings of said planet. Picard, ever the force of truth and justice, refuses to go along (hence the \\"Insurrection\\" title), leading to a battle between good and \\"greater good.\\" <br /> <br />On the whole, I feel this was the most well-written and executed TNG Trek film. While I personally adored the previous 2, I thought their storylines were a bit contrived (not to mention the continuity errors caused by Kirk's \\"death\\" at the beginning of Generations). The deeper storyline of this movie is both its weakness and its strength; I had a bit of a problem following the plot the first time I saw the film, but after I was able to appreciate it, I realized how much better of a storyline it actually is. I highly recommend this movie to all TNG fans, and any Trekkie who enjoys the \\"ethical dilemma\\" storylines.

B0006J28L4|5.0|This is my favorite Spike Lee \\"joint\\" (personally, I hate that characterization, but Spike likes being Spike).  I saw the film in a theater, and I didn't get up once.  Despite the fact that the film is 201 minutes long, and there was no intermission, it was absolutely riveting, and one of the better epics ever made.  Denzel Washington is utterly amazing as Malcolm X, bringing the fire, passion, intelligence, and dignity the man had.  He should have won the Oscar.  Spike's direction is really assured, and he doesn't use too many visual tricks here, because the original story is so good.  Spike is also good as Shorty, one of Malcolm's friends from his crime days.  Originally, I thought Lee had just added the character to give himself a role, but Shorty is mentioned in The Autobiography of Malcolm X.  The Mecca scenes are mesmerizing and visually stunning, but it almost didn't happen.  Warner Brothers wanted Spike to shoot these scenes in Jersey (!) on the beaches there.  Spike ended up calling Warner's racist (which they weren't, they were just being a cheap studio), and it turned a lot of people off of this film and may have cost Spike and Denzel Oscars.  Denzel won for Training Day, which is a far worse film.  Regardless, this is a magnificent, balanced, and very thorough biopic of a fascinating man.  It's one of the better biopics made.  Spike never rushes through anything here.  It's one of Spike's best films...
B000PUAHOY|5.0|I watched \\"Inland Empire\\" in a theater once.  Since then, I have formed my own interpretation and read countless others.  Some people want to dismiss the film because there is no linear plot, and they don't \\"get it\\".  My opinion is that if a film lends itself to discussion (which requires thinking), it is a great film.  I enjoy a film that stays with me, and \\"Inland Empire\\" had done just that since March.  I can't wait to buy it on DVD, and watch many more times to see what I can pick up that I missed the first time.  Definitely worth at least one viewing, but probably many more.
B00005JPPI|4.0|<br />This is a good movie to watch - good, not great, but it was better than \\"ok\\", hence the 4 stars.  It was also better than I had anticipated.  It is entertaining enough to purchase and watch more than once, not in the way you would watch a favorite, but kind of like a Sunday-lounge-around-with-nothing-better-to-do-watching.  Entertaining with excellent acting and even though you may be able to figure out the \\"twist\\", it won't take away from your enjoyment of it. <br /> <br />This legal thriller presents an extremely intelligent husband (Hopkins), who has just attempted to murder his wife, shooting her in the head for having an affair, pitted against the young, hot-shot lawyer (Gosling).  Gosling is on his way out of the DA's office for a more lucrative job in corporate law, but, Gosling's character takes on the prosecution against Hopkin's character because apparently Hopkins has signed his own confession to murdering his wife and Gosling feels it is a quick open and shut case. <br /> <br />What appears to be an open and shut case for Gosling turns anything but.  The man who was having an affair with the wife just happens to be the arresting officer when Hopkin's character was taken into custody throwing a monkey wrench into the works.  Hopkins has a field day with Gosling's character because he was unprepared to see past the possibility of being played.  Any more comment about this could give away spoilers. <br /> <br />Gosling's character is purposely hard to root for at the beginning, but by mid movie you will be rooting for him.  Hopkin's character, who you may be laughing with a couple of times, eventually is presented as the maniacal killer he is just as you are rooting for Gosling's character. <br /> <br />*****The Bottom Line***** <br />For those who buy only those movies that they would watch more than once, then this is an entertaining movie and should be a part of your collection. <br />Hopkins is always excellent and Gosling plays his part extremely well.  The acting overall is great and even though you may be able to guess a twist, it is still a good movie.   You won't be disappointed by this movie. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've been a fan of SF for about 45 years now, starting with my father's anthologies.  The Start Trek and Star Wars franchises were the mega hits of science fiction.  Firefly could have been bigger - MUCH bigger.  The characters were more complex and three-dimensional, and the plots were tight and well-fleshed out. <br /> <br />Not being much of a TV watcher for several years now, I missed Firefly when it aired on Fox.  I saw the DVD's just a few weeks ago in the video store and rented one to take a look.  What on earth were the suits at Fox thinking?  WERE they thinking?  (My guess is \\"No.\\") <br /> <br />This is destined to be a legendary show.  Fox didn't have a clue as to what they had. <br /> <br />Our loss.
B000OVLNII|4.0|It looks like I will be the 273rd person to review this impressive volume. I will do my best to add a different perspective.<br /><br />\\"No harm's done to history by making it something someone would want to read.\\" -David McCullough<br /><br />When I read a history book I realize that there multiple types of history books out there. Setting aside the ones that are designed to distort history (such as holocaust denier literature) there are still several styles of history book. They range from the small topical books that offer a brief overview to the more popular histories such as those that David McCollough specializes to definitive works - the type of work that others will refer back to for decades to come.<br /><br />Doris Kearns Goodwin's \\"Team of Rivals is just such a definitive work. It checks in at 754 pages of text with more than a hundred pages of 8 font footnotes. It took her 10 years to produce this book and it is a work of which she can be proud. It is exhaustively researched and documented.<br /><br />However, that is also the problem with the book. It is so large, so thorough that only the heartiest of readers will ever finish it. There are so many details, so many quotes, so much substance to this book that it gets tiring to read, especially the middle 500 pages or so. I started this book in January and I finished it the last week of April. In the meantime I read 12 other books and many magazines. I never stopped reading this one, but so many other books pulled me away from this one along the way.<br /><br />Unlike the McCollough books (or Stephen Ambrose or James McPherson or Bruce Catton), the level of detail overwhelms the reader. A valuable resource to refer back to but just not the stuff that popular histories are made from.<br /><br />So, I'm giving this one multiple grades:<br /><br />Research, thoroughness: A+<br /><br />Readibility, high level of interest to the average history buff:C+<br /><br />Final Grade: B+<br /><br />A suggestion: It would have been instructive to have gone into more detail and tell more about how Lincoln's \\"Team\\" collapsed with under President Andrew Johnson. She briefly touches on it, but bit more would have been interesting. Perhaps another volume?It would have been instructive to have gone into more detail and tell more about how Lincoln's \\"Team\\" collapsed with under President Andrew Johnson.

B000NA1OXY|2.0|The reason that your first album sold so well is that you were in more control. I guess your hangers on are having a greater influence. I borrowed this cd from a friend and I couldn't make it through any of the songs. I saw Avril live when the first album was out. I thought finally an artist that might be someone. I guess I was wrong. This bubblegum tennie bop won't get you far. Maybe if they let you make a new album you might want to try for your roots.
B000MRAAJM|2.0|This is a review of blu-ray edition, not of the contents.    I was expecting the quality to be superior to all other BBC documentaries that I own. I was disappointed miserably, to the point that I feel compelled to write my first online review.    Equipment: Sony PS3 feeding a 46 inch Sony Bravia 1080P, through premium HDMI cable.    The good: Colors are stunning, and some shots, specially the ones from space, are absolutely breathtaking.    The bad: Many grainy scenes. Quality varies. Some shots are as good as my DVD edition of Blue Planet. Some are better, and some are worse. A lot worse. In fact, in some scenes grain is so bad that if it were a movie, I would have thought it is done on purpose for the artistic effect. Somehow I had the impression that the master for this series was high def digitial, but it sure seems that quite a bit of it was film.    The terrible: Here is something I had not seen before. Flicker. Huh?? On flyover scenes of waterfalls, screen starts flickering with a rising tempo. As we pass over the falls and look back at the falling water, flicker turns into a 'snow' screen that flashes at about 1 sec intervals. This is so bad that I am hoping I have a faulty component somewhere. :-(    In summary: If you are thinking about buying the blu-ray edition for video quality, it might be better to rent it first to see if you have the issues that I did.    ----------------------    Follow up: Based on suggestions of others, I played with connection, TV adjustements, noise reduction setting, and resolution settings. This is definitely a 1080P issue. At 720p, the problem is not present at all. At 1080i, the problem is present but almost unnoticeable. At 1080p problem is very obvious. The most annoying scene is disk 1, episode 3, as we fly over Angel Falls and look back. I can pause the picture and single frame advance to a frame that the 'snow' is very prominent. While picture is paused here, I can change resolutions, and see the noise only in 1080p. Since I do not have another blu-ray player, nor another TV, I cannot conclusively blame the disk. But I have had this problem only with this disk.

B000F1IQN2|4.0|If Munich was just a Hollywood movie about a group of guys out to kill every member of a group of terrorists responsible for killing their friends, then this movie of revenge would had had so much more potential.  As it is, it is based on the true story of Islamic terrorists from a group Black September that take the Israeli Olympic team hostage at the 1972 Olympic games and kill 9 of them in a resulting rescue attempt. The Israeli Mossad creates a covert team to kill in secrecy every single person responsible from Black September responsible for that attack.<br /><br />When Stephen Spielberg decided to make a movie based on the events of Munich, that instantly created a lot of expectations. I expect that a majority of Americans, regardless of political affiliation, see that what the Mossad did as justified. To make a movie about the Munich events and turn it into a celebration of what the Mossad did, a revenge flick, might have been the popular thing to do. I personally believe Israel had every right to retalliate the way it did, and believe the Palestinians deserved the fate they got in this movie. But I'm not naive to believe the Palestinians don't have a complaint about how they've been treated at times.<br /><br />So, I went into this movie knowing it had received bad reviews and some cited it as revisionist history or basically saying what the Mossad did was just as bad as what Black September did. First of all, the movie is long but extremely well made. The story moves swifly and the violence is brutal.  Eric Bana plays Avner, the Mossad agent assigned the task of killing the Black September members one by one. Avner accepts the task and begins working with his team, which includes future Bond Daniel Craig. They buy information and carry out the executions. There are problems at times and the group must deal with faulty equipment and collateral damage.  But the ultimate villian they must face is the fact that just as they are hunting, they are now being hunted. Soon, they realize they must be on the lookout for attacks against them. At the same time, the weight of what they are doing begins to eat away at Avner's core. The killings are changing him, and they are keeping him away from his wife and newborn child.<br /><br />I don't know enough about the true events of the Munich retalliation to comment on whether or not this movie got the historical facts correct. I do know many commented that the movie was a statement on the USA's current war on terror. Maybe that is correct, but Israel's been fighting the war on terror for years. I think Munich made points not for the benefit of today's Iraq war, but to show that what people assume is true now, was also true then. For one example, the point is made that when a member of Black September is killed, he is just replaced by someone else. So, what good does it do to kill one if a new one will take its place. This is a point to consider, but the movie never really takes a side. This is a movie really about a man, Avner, played excellently by Eric Bana. He eagerly fulfills his duty to his country, but the weight of his actions ultimately are too much for him to handle.<br /><br />In conclusion, you won't be able to watch this movie without giving at least some thought the the history behind it as well as the current situation in Iraq.  That being said, I think you'll be able to enjoy this movie regardless of your political beliefs.hunted. Soon, they realize they must be on the lookout for attacks against them.

B00003CX9S|5.0|This is probably David Lynch's most \\"normal\\" movie and maybe most mainstream and he did a remarkable job.This movie is sad and gets to me every time I watch it.For younger people it would seem boring to them because this isn't a horror movie and the movie does take its time,but that's the point.You get to know the characters and the only \\"monster\\" or \\"monsters\\" in this movie are the ones that mistreat and abuse John Merrick.Sometimes it's hard to watch only because this is a true story and all the abuse he went through.For the fact,he was this smart and beautiful human being underneath,but he had this horrible disease...Great acting all around.
B000O178BY|4.0|Calling this a masterpiece might be a bit overboard but then again, maybe I'll change my opinion over time. <br />I've been listening to NIN since Pretty Hate Machine and I'd have to say this cd is a cross between The Downward Spiral and PHM. <br />Personally, I never thought Downward Spiral was all that so I was a bit hesitant to get this cd when I heard people comparing the 2 albums. My favorite NIN cds had previously been PHM and With Teeth. So maybe I like Trent's more melodic side. <br /> <br />I was surprised at how much I like this cd. It's got the thumping bass lines that pull you in. It's got the whispering melodies that keep your attention. <br />Yeah, there is a lot of noise but not so much that it distracts from the music.  <br />This cd is really good. REALLY good. Not 5 stars but close. I can't give it 5 stars because I have a feeling it won't be the type of cd that I still listen to in 10 years like PHM.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I am just going to echo the hundreds of 5 star ratings for this CD. Anyone can find something touching in this album from 21 to 101 years old.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|There are some problems with this widely acclaimed film by Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who previously gave us Amores perros (2000) and 21 Grams (2003), but they really don't matter because the film is so interesting and so very well acted and directed.  The script by Guillermo Arriaga, who also wrote the script for Amores perros and 21 Grams, weaves the lives of people from Mexico, the US, Morocco, and Japan into a single story held together tenuously by the delicate thread of a bullet from a rifle.<br /><br />The rifle belonged to a Japanese businessman who gave it to a Moroccan guide after hunting in Morocco, who sold it to a goat herder, who gave it to his sons to shoot jackals.  The younger son shot at a tour bus in which the very well-to-do American couple Richard and Susan (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) are traveling, hitting Susan in the shoulder.  Meanwhile, the two young children of Richard and Susan are being watched by their Mexican nanny Amelia (Adriana Barraza) who needs to attend her son's wedding.  But she can find nobody to take care of the kids, so she takes them across the border with her to the wedding.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how contrived this plot is (actually I thought it was rather creative) because the point is to show how connected we are all in this world.  A butterfly may flap its wings in the Sahara and it may rain in Florida and maybe there is some cause and effect, as they tell us is possible in chaos theory.  And maybe these people are no closer that six degrees of separation, and maybe their voices are babel to one another.  But what Inarritu is intent on showing us is that we are all human and share the same feelings, whether a lonely Japanese girl looking for love in all the wrong ways, or a privileged very white woman in the desert with a bullet hole in her shoulder looking for the love of a husband she thinks she has lost.  Furthermore, the character and worth of a Mexican nanny is equal to that of a Japanese tycoon which is equal to that of a Moroccan goat herder which is equal to that of a little white girl, and so on.<br /><br />While most people admired this movie, and it received many awards and nominations for awards, some viewers did not like it; and some of those viewers vented.  When a good movie is trashed because it has a few plot holes or because the logic is a bit off, you can be sure that the person doing the trashing has been offended.  Usually it is some kind of sexuality depicted that offends.  Sometimes the source of the anger is political or even racial.  Here it definitely could be sexual since we see some under age sexual activity (masturbation and exhibitionism) done in a somewhat kinky way.  Or it could be that some viewers did not feel sympathetic toward the deaf and mute Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) or were disgusted with a boy who spies on his sister and then gets sexually aroused.  Or it could even be that some viewers really were offended by the stupid behavior of some of the characters.<br /><br />Surely Amelia could have found somebody to watch the kids.  Surely she knew it was dangerous to return to the US with her drunken nephew Santiago (Mexican heart throb, Gael Garcia Bernal) at the wheel.  And of course the selfishness of Richard and Susan to put her in such a spot was wrong.  And the pathetic desperation of Chieko acted out in such a blatant manner, as she throws herself at men must have offended many.  To me, though, the psychology projected by Inarritu and Arriaga was striking and largely compelling even while it was controversial.  When a young girl presents her naked body to a man and is rejected, it could be psychologically devastating to the girl.  She is offering her entire self to him and he does want her.  And perhaps the ambiguous question of why she appeared naked on the balcony as her father comes home and embraces her is troubling.  We want to understand what is being asked and answered here.  Something troubling to the ordinary human psyche perhaps.<br /><br />Anyway, do not let the nay sayers dissuade you from watching this excellent movie.  Regardless of how one might feel about the ideas of Inarritu and Arriaga, they are very much worth viewing in an artistic, a psychological, and a political sense.  It may seem easy to construct a movie with a rising sense of tension and to develop characters that will interest the audience with just a few scenes and even fewer lines, but it isn't; and to do it with such a convoluted plot is even more remarkable.<br /><br />So see this for Inarritu who got the most out of the actors, from top drawer professionals like Pitt and Blanchett to beginners like Boubker Ait El Caid who played the younger Moroccan boy, Yussef, and for Arriaga who wrote the excellent script..

B000065BPB|4.0|Excellent sounds but please be patient.  Right out of the box they'll disappoint but after \\"burn-in\\" I find it hard to tell the difference between this and my $160 pair of earphones.  The main difference between the HD280 and my more expensive earphones are the sound separation of the instruments.  While I can hear sounds I haven't heard before in the HD280, the sound of some of those instruments are distant and sometimes hard to distinguished.  While in my more expensive earphones the sounds are clear and effortless to distinguished.   <br />That is why I recommend the HD280 because they sound almost as good as other headphones costing twice the price.  I think the HD280 fills the $70-80 price niche very nicely and you'll have a hard time finding a good sounding, CLOSED headphones for the price they are selling it at Amazon.   <br />P.S:  I put closed in bold because that's the main selling point for me in buying the HD280.  You can easily buy headphones that'll beat the HD280 in sound quality and price except they'll be open headphones.
0062502182|1.0|A friend gave me this book as a Christmas gift, and just recently I found time to start reading it.  I had heard nothing but positive things about the Alchemist, and how the book had really opened peoples' eyes to their potential.  People told me how great the lessons it teaches are and how beautiful the writing is.  But, halfway through the book I put it down and I have no desire to pick it back up again. <br /> <br />The writing is sophomoric at best.  Nearly every page the author feels the need to remind you why his protagonist is on his quest: to find his \\"personal legend.\\"  I just read that 20 pages ago, thanks, I didn't forget.  And rather than allow you to make connections between characters found in the beginning, middle, and end (I'm assuming new characters are presented in the end since I didn't actually read the whole rotten book) the author spoon feeds you the connections he wants you to make.  The worst part of the book is just how painfully simple the writing is; I don't know, maybe it loses something being translated to English, but it is horrible. <br /> <br />If you want spiritual, beautifully written parables go buy the King James Bible and read the New Testament and forget about the Alchemist.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|When this movie first came out, my son begged me to see it, but I inwardly groaned and resisted with every fiber of my being. How many Rocky incarnations are we supposed to put up with? When the DVD came out I finally relented, and you know what? I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Rocky is past the prime of his life, has settled into an obviously reluctant retirement from boxing, and has lost Adrian, the woman he so dearly loved. Rocky spends a lot of time reminiscing about the past, and his life with Adrian. Cranky ole Paulie (gotta love him!) is still in the picture, but has lost patience with Rocky's inability to let go of the past. Likewise, Rocky has a strained relationship with his son, who is angry about having to live under the shadow of the Italian Stallion.<br /><br />The reigning heavyweight champ is a young boxer by the name of Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon. In the ring, Mason always manages to pound the competition in the first round, which has left boxing fans feeling disappointed and alienated. For fun, ESPN holds a virtual boxing match between Mason and Rocky (in his prime), and you guessed it, Rocky wins! This virtual boxing match sets off a chain of events that leads Rocky back into the ring.<br /><br />Bittersweet, nostalgic, extremely touching, and of course you want Rocky to win! The boxing scenes were well-choreographed, and so action-packed they made my heart pound! I was also highly impressed by the dialogue (especially Lil' Marie's pep talk and the what-for Rocky finally gives his son), which was written by none other than Sylvester Stallone himself. ROCKY BALBOA serves to remind us that it's not whether you win or lose, but it's how you play the game. Well worthy!

The only thing I can complain about is the lack of bonus material which you will find on the DVD version of Planet Earth, but is is not included on the blu-ray or HD-DVD discs. Why they choose to not include this on these HD formats is beyond me, but other than that and the sound (Compared to the video, the audio is a bit of a disappointment) this series is almost perfect.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000MRAAJM Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000MRAAJW Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD]]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series]]
0374105235|5.0|I tend to be drawn towards fiction and non-fiction books that recount hard or depressing times, and this one takes the cake. It was difficult to read at times, I had to put it down and walk away because it was so disturbing. But, I think it's a story that should be heard. I didn't know much about the conflict in the Sierra Leone area before reading this and now I know a lot more, which was also aided by the historical timeline the author presented in the back of the book. I wished I would have read that first to help me understand the political situation. <br /> <br />The only thing I did not like was the ending. Although we know the author made it to safety and to the U.S. I felt like he left me hanging at the end, I wanted him to write about his complete journey to the U.S..
B00008QSA5|4.0|I can't give this album a full 5 stars, but it's close, and certainly a classic of its type.  Not many artists could pull off a rather loose \\"jam\\" session and have it hold up as well as this has.  It just shows how much class and talent Al Kooper has.  Tough enough, but how about when Mike Bloomfield fails to show on the 2nd day of the sessions, and Al has to recruit Steve Stills at literally the last minute.  All things considered, it's amazing that this album even saw the light of day, much less that it is considered a sort of classic of its type.   <br /> <br />But let's explore that.  Among jazz musicians, jam sessions are quite normal, but it's usually a bit different for rock musicians.  In this case, Al was as much of a jazz afficiando as he was blues, soul and rock, so he probably relished the idea to get Bloomfield and a good rhythm section, a couple of tunes he and Mike wanted to cover, and see what would happen.  They did exactly that (at least for one day) and the results are pretty impressive.  There are a few miscues: The phasing on \\"You Don't Love Me\\" is very dated and gets annoying quickly. <br /> <br />But still, if you can overlook the quirks and the obvious holes that are inevitably going to be there, there is a great spirit to this set.  Sometimes living dangerously brings out what playing it safe could never get you, and I think that's what happens here.  The adventure outweighs the lack of preparation, and the results are a truly unique listening experience.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|call me old-fashioned, but i was utterly charmed by this movie.  it's about love, and people trying to reach each other.  true, it is sexually graphic, but who hasn't tried to communicate through sex?  anyway, if the \\"porn\\" content doesn't disturb you, you'll be delighted.
B000O178BY|5.0|Year Zero to me is melody and hooks at war with the cold blue steel of industrial sounds and rhythms, song after song.  The hooks come furiously in songs like the Beginning of the End, The Good Soldier, and the Warning.  In other songs like Vessel, Me I'm Not, and God Given, the foot-stomping precision of industrial mechanics comes to the fore.  Other songs such as the Great Destroyer achieve a standoff, starting with traditional hooks that would lead off other albums, but here are sacrificed in a battle with a computer synthesized jam that ends the song.    <br /> <br />Be forewarned, if you're into guitar rock, this might not be the album for you.  Although Year Zero does have plenty of guitar, it is not exclusively guitar.   <br /> <br />This album is also quite heavy.  If you're going to play it on speakers, they better have the quality and power headroom to handle some serious low frequency pulsing.  At the expense of bass, good quality headphones might be a better alternative. <br /> <br />One last thing, the album does have a political angle that might bother you.  Figure this out before and decline to buy, rather than writing a one-star review in disgust after you buy. <br />
034544678X|5.0|This book is a key reference about positive dog training written from the perspective of both scientist and practioner.  I think it is a model for all trainers and dog training facilities (dog clubs, canine schools, etc.).  The author's website is also helpful  [...]
B0000714BP|4.0|\\"To Wong Foo\\" presents a rose-colored view of the world in which all of our problems can be solved if we just tap<br /><br />into our inner fabulousness! Why, even the problems of  seriously abused housewife CarolAnne (Stockard Channing) are cheerfully swept under the rug. I am not blaming the movie for its optimistic life view and colorful hues. It helps the poor abused Carol Ann that drag Queen Vita Boheme (Patrick Swayze) appears as her \\"angel\\" and lays some serious smack down on her pig of a husband (Arliss Howard).<br /><br /> Three drag Queen ends up stranded in some un-named fictional, backwater Podunk town  when their Convertible breaks down en route from New York to Hollywood. The ladies, naturally, end up transforming the lives of everybody in town over the course of a single, magical weekend. The ladies are pursued by racist, homophobic Sheriff Dollard (the late Chris Penn) who, we discover in a funny bar scene, is a major closet case!<br /><br />  The premise is slight, but the performances are outstanding. Your enjoyment of the film may depend on how  you respond to the leading (heterosexual) men playing the leading (gay men in drag) ladies. Snipes (as Noxemi Jackson)  and Leguizamo are especially excellent at  bringing their inner Drag Queens out. John Leguizamo is outstanding as Chi Chi Rodreiguiz.  The role of Vita Boheme represents a major change of pace for Swayze, previously known for macho roles in \\"Dirty Dancing\\" and \\"RoadHouse.\\" Swayze is only half as convincing and successful as Snipes and Leguizamo, but the good news ladies and gentlemen is that he is every bit as sexy and attractive as Lady Vita Boheme as  he is as a man (himself). Hey, I'm not asking Swayze to give me the moon here. He really is very good. Robin Williams also makes a fun and funny cameo appearance.<br /><br />  \\"To Wong Foo\\" is so optimistic it might as well be a Disney movie, \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\" or \\"The Sound Of Music.\\" I'm all for films about self-esteem and self-empowerment, as long as the viewer realizes that this level of rosy self-empowerment can be achieved in movies but seldom in real life. This is a perfect movie to watch if your feeling depressed. This movie made me smile and laugh when I was experiencing severe depressions.<br /><br /> I cracked up in uncontrollable laughter when Swayze said, \\"Oh, what in gay hell?\\" (is this? as Penn's car is seen behind them on the road). \\"To Wong Foo\\" is gay in every sense of the word (emphasis on bright, sunny, colorful, happy) and there is certainly nothing wrong with that.  Say \\"Amen.\\"nt, as long as the viewer realizes that this level of rosy self-empowerment can be achieved in movies but seldom in real life.

B000E0WJIC|2.0|The Poison was introduced to me by a friend of mine who thought I might like them. The first song was good but,the rest of the album left a sour taste in my mouth. If I had to describe this record I would say it sounds like Atreyu and Avenged Sevenfold had a love child. The guitar is actually really good but, the singing is way too emo for my taste. It isn't very original either.You might even think that you have heard some of these songs on other metal records that recently came out.\\"The Poison\\" does have it's moments. I liked \\"Spit You Out\\" and \\"4 Words\\" alot. Had there been more metal singing, less emo singing, and a little more originality it might have been worth buying. Instead they just leave you wondering if the same people who created N'Sync created these guys. 2 stars weak
B00005JPPL|5.0|I am happy to say I really enjoyed this movie.  I read some bad reviews of it online, but wanted to give the movie a chance.  I'm glad I did. <br /> <br />Nicolas Cage plays a character that can see 2 minutes into the future, which is certainly a superhuman ability.  You can imagine many of the scenarios that might unfold through use of this ability, but the movie manages to keep it fresh and interesting.  I think the subtleties of his ability and actions are portrayed very well.  He is quite the smooth operator, and plenty cool.  There is a lot of action in this movie, and it is exciting from the start.  I also liked the fact that love enhances his ability, and liked Jessica Biel as his love interest.  If there was a flaw in this movie, it would be the ending, which left something to the imagination... a bit too much to the imagination by some people's standards.  However it doesn't ruin the movie in my opinion.  I only buy movies that I really like and want to see again many times.  This is one of those movies.  Check it out!
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Think of the feeling when you take a sip of a fine Cognac! You feel the warmth touch every part of you from the inside and the body tingles with joy. \\"Track 6: Thinking About You\\" does exactly that and is your reason to buy this album. What Norah Jones had done with \\"Come away with me\\" and her other Grammy winning classics, she now does with \\"Thinking about you\\". She could have done a 100 things with that melody that would only make it less pure. As always, she decides to keep it simple with her angelic vocals and light accompaniments. This song will be a classic.<br /><br />I bought this album as a gift for my wife. It worked! ;-) \\"Track 2: Sinking Soon\\" is her favorite though.
B00004Y2QT|4.0|I enjoyed the concert. I love Prince!! His music is beautiful! This dvd is great if you want Prince and others live on stage. I would love to find a dvd that just has his videos from Mtv. I am going to buy \\"Purple Rain\\", then at least I can watch Prince perform his music alone.
B000026C3T|5.0|THE BAND: Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (guitars), John Paul Jones (bass, keyboards), John Bonham (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISCS: (1990) 26 songs on 2 discs clocking in at approximately 144 total minutes (about 72 minutes per disc). Included with the discs is a 6-page booklet containing song titles/credits/times, several band photos, and thank you's. This 2-disc set is the (import) European \\"highlights\\" portion of the bigger 4-disc (54 total songs) set under the same name. This compilation follows the band from 1969-79. Digitally remastered sound. Produced by Jimmy Page. Label - Atlantic Records.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: Debut \\"1\\" (4 songs), II (3), III (3), IV-Zoso (5), Houses Of The Holy (4), Physical Graffiti (3), Presence (2), In Through The Out Door (2).<br /><br />COMMENTS: For a rock band as big as Led Zeppelin was, there simply aren't a whole lot of compilations to choose from. Personally, I think that's a good thing. For the true beginner, this mix is a great intro to the band. For the listener wanting a few studio albums - I'd recommend \\"II\\", \\"IV\\"... and then \\"Houses Of The Holy and \\"Physical Graffiti\\". All of Led Zeppelin's albums are essential in my book - some simply more so than others. Chronological order here is a bonus (the 4-disc set is surprisingly NOT in chronological order) and you can hear the band maturing through the years. Only thing that could have made this 2-disc set better is utilzing the whole disc(s). Both discs left approximately 8 minutes of blank space and why not put another song or two on each - plenty of omitted classic songs to choose from (i.e. \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\", \\"The Ocean\\", \\"In My Time Of Dying\\", \\"Fool In The Rain\\", \\"Gallows Pole\\", \\"Going To California\\", \\"Thank You\\", \\"Living Loving Maid\\", \\"Moby Dick\\", or anything from \\"CODA\\"). The remastered sound is ultra crisp and the songs sound amazing. Looking for a great place to have many a classic Zeppelin song all in one place - look no further (5 stars).
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Visually arresting, CHILDREN OF MEN is one of those movies that are best appreciated after being viewed a second or third time.  The vision of the future is chilling as society frays at the edges amidst massive infertility. Governments have become increasing authoritarian and government-dispensed pills become the opiates of the masses.  The specter of human extinction looms on many levels - some manmade and others biological.   <br /> <br />The presence of a pregnant refugee becomes a symbol of hope and redemption as the movie's protagonist transforms from indifference to committed partisan in her journey to safety.  We can all hope that a \\"HUMAN PROJECT\\" awaits to save us from the long-term consequences of our own folly.   <br /> <br />A haunting soundtrack complements the cinematography.  Michael Caine turns in a brief yet masterful performance.  Not quite on the order of BLADE RUNNER (what is?), but definitely worth seeing!
B0006B2A2E|5.0|I'm a big fan. <br /> <br />It poses a real question, how important are our memories to us? They are a part of us, the foundation of our personality. If there were a machine to erase certain memories from your mind are there any you'd want taken away? I'm sure that there are, but should you. <br /> <br />We've all been in serious relationships that have come to pass and like Joel in the film eventually comes to realize is that its those memories bad or good that characterize us. In real life we do not find ourselves back with our old lovers ready to make the same mistakes all over again. We don't run back to them and say  I love your flaws. The ending to the movie in a way demeans the true message of the film (but Hollywood does that).  <br /> <br />Can our lost love for those gone help us love those around us even more. Those memories of joyful times are worth holding onto. I read an article in National Geographic in which a doctor says (I'm paraphrasing) \\"often in romantic conquests we are trying to recreate the past, not establish a future.\\" <br /> <br />Does it have to be that way? Why can't we harness that same energy and put it toward creating new memories to rival those we love so much. By relishing those memories of the past can't we create hope for the future. I have loved, do love, and hopefully will continue to love. What I hope for is to love the way I once loved. <br /> <br />How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! <br />The world forgetting, by the world forgot. <br />Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! <br />Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd; <br />Labour and rest, that equal periods keep; <br />\\"Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep;\\" <br />Desires compos'd, affections ever ev'n, <br />Tears that delight, and sighs that waft to Heav'n. <br />Grace shines around her with serenest beams, <br />And whisp'ring angels prompt her golden dreams. <br />For her th' unfading rose of Eden blooms, <br />And wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes, <br />For her the Spouse prepares the bridal ring, <br />For her white virgins hymeneals sing, <br />To sounds of heav'nly harps she dies away, <br />And melts in visions of eternal day.
1582701709|3.0|How do you rate and review a book like this!  It is unkind to poke too much logic at it, because there really are many people who will get valuable, and even lifetime, advice and calls to action from it.  This is a good thing, and you hate to throw lukewarm water on it, thus spoiling the happiness of persons who would like to charge ahead with the good stuff written inside.  At the same time, you do not want to laud a work too highly that just has too many doubtful sayings in it, especially the ones dealing with science. <br /> <br />So here is a compromise.  If you really enjoy the inspirational sort of self-help book that spurs you to think and consider the good things in life, then The Secret is a worthwhile purchase.  If you prefer a more technically-set book with regard to harder philosophy and science, then check the book out of your library instead. <br /> <br />The doubtful parts have to do with one too many phrases that say the universe began with a thought (per Einstein, no less!), that particle energy is related to personal energy, and that everything is nothing but energy anyway.  And so forth.  This scientific laziness kind of takes away some of the inspiration from the rest of the narrative.  If the science was well founded, then we could do some testing of the book's claims.  And the idea of bad-thoughts / good-thoughts controlling life outcomes smacks of too much religiosity (didn't get what you wanted?  Then you didn't think/pray/wish hard enough.).  If you do read this book, not only does Christopher Reeve's absence come to mind, but also stuff like:  can a diabetic throw away his insulin?
B000K7UBTI|2.0|I feel I am among the minority of people being happy with \\"Ultimate Avengers\\" movies from Marvel and Lionsgate, especially by the first one. Unfortunately, this outing has nothing to do with them. Neither the character of Tony Stark is the same, nor music, nor the visuals, neither the quality of the story, so I have second thoughts about getting \\"Dr. Strange\\" from the same studios.
B0000TB014|5.0|Love It!! Took me back to my High school days! I miss the talent that is not in the new videos on Mtv! Michael Jackson was and is Great!
B00005JPO8|5.0|Wow, what a fantastic film. On many levels the story is absolutely riviting. Don't miss this one.
0765316978|4.0|I liked this novel a lot, although I did not think that it was as good as \\"Old Man's War.\\"  Here, the scenario is simple (no spoilers here).  John Perry and Jane Sagan have settled on a colony world and are generally happy with their lives.  The Colonial Union then taps them to lead the colonization of a new world.  More would be telling, but be assured that there are plenty of surprises.<br /><br />This novel turns on some very imaginative speculations about interstellar politics in the context of the \\"Old Man's War\\" universe.  These did hold my interest. As always, I enjoyed reading about John Perry and Jane Sagan.  Here I found the characterizations and speculations about the aliens to be a little disappointing--not nearly as interesting as in \\"Old Man's War.\\"  The aliens are all-too-humanlike in their behavior, and this was a bit of a disappointment to me.  The Consu connection (no spoiler here) is never adequately explained.  I found the ending to be a little disappointing, and frankly, it is not conclusive.  A fourth novel in the series is necessary to clean it up, but Scalzi says that there will be no fourth novel.  I am betting that this turns out not to be the case.  (Remember Asimov's Robot novels?)<br /><br />This is a fast and interesting read, and if you liked the previous two novels in the series (\\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"The Ghost Brigades\\") you will like this one too.  Recommended.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a movie that took time to grow on me. It doesn't move quickly, but it is full of depth and that shines through with every viewing. With vivid often surrealistic imagery and sharp witty dialog the film manages to entertain you while telling the real story. <br />  I find most love stories to be trite, formulaic, and self-indulgent. This is far from that.  What kind of love do our protagonists feel? They never sleep together, although they both wanted too. Bob even cheats on his wife with another woman but still doesn't sleep with Charlotte who he has fallen in love with. <br />  That part of the story gives their love purity and validity. They marketed the movie as a story of friendship, but that is a lie. They love each other in a very real way, but they can't express it. <br />  Both are married, the elder in a marriage of 25 years with children, the younger a newlywed trying to maintain a strained marriage. It is that unrequited love that makes it so beautiful. They love each other and are spending time with each other but they don't have each other. <br />  Most of the time unrequited love is one way. A man is obssessed with a woman who doesn't return his feelings or maybe maybe even dislikes the man. This love is a far more tragic love. A love that stays in one place, one moment. <br />  Watching the film you wish they could stay in Japan. We all have moments in our lives like that. A month, week, day, or hour that we wish we could freeze ourselves in. Outside that moment means nothing, no worries of the moments past or future. Just you and that moment trapped in happiness. Maybe thats heaven. <br /> <br />\\"Let's never come here again because it will never be as much fun\\"
B000F3T3CS|5.0|If you like comic opera, this is the opera dvd for you. The voices are good and the casting works well. Rolando as Nemorino is naive enough to be the village idiot, but it makes for comedy. Anna as Adina is cute and saucy. When Nemorino sings Una Furtiva Lagrima, the audience goes wild and he(visibly touched) sings an encore. When Adina finally succumbs to Nemorino's pleas, their reaction to one another nearly sets the stage on fire. The chemistry between them is sensational. If you like this one, you'll also like the other opera videos in which they are teamed. I've watched it twice and am not tired of it. I've also bought a second copy as a Christmas present for a friend.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|Which, I guess, is OK if you're into the collective guilt trip the film industry seems to be wallowing in these days. Unfortunately for the filmmakers and the movie's babbling fans, the general population is not awash in unrestrained apologizing for the ghastly crime of opposing illegal immigration, and punished this thinly disguised op-ed piece at the box office like it richly deserved. <br /> <br />Let's put things into perspective. A bunch of rich entertainers who no doubt live in gated communities complete with servant filled mansions just spent tens of millions of dollars to tell us capitalism = bad, illegal immigration = good. Of course, this film also lost tens of million dollars, a point seemed to be completely missed by its admirers. First and foremost, movies are intended to be entertainment, and at that this pic fails admirably. Lesson #1 of capitalism: If people don't like your product, they ain't buying. The world is filled with Philistines. <br /> <br />Of course, anti-American leftists are filled with unrestrained glee over the movie's images of The Man rounding up fugees, bagging their heads, and throwing them in cages. It somehow authenticates the fantasies they harbor that such things go on in America today, and that the film's director was actually making a comment about present conditions. I guess when reality conflicts with cherished political myths, it's just best to make - or watch - a movie that conforms and adheres to your moveon.org agenda. <br /> <br />All of the political posturing would be more easily forgiven if the movie itself was actually any good. It's not. Clive Owen stumbles through this mess like he was recently lobotomized. Whether this is due to Clive's acting ability or the mind-numbing realization that he'd just made a seriously stupid career move is unknown. Who cares? He sucked. Chiwetel Ejiofor played a great, sinister villain in SERENITY, but here his character is never fleshed out and his talents are wasted. J. Moore's character could have been completely written out of the script and the movie would have suffered nothing for it. The pregnant girl was just irritating and evoked little to no sympathy. <br /> <br />Really, the only exciting, somewhat gripping part of the movie was the final battle scene (very well done combat scenes and great 5.1 audio) and the somewhat hopeful final scene with Clive in the boat. But even here, the gaping plot holes left me feeling mostly dissatisfied with all the unanswered questions. <br /> <br />Basically, if you think the United States government - in collusion with Israel - is responsible for 9/11, and you really like being lectured to about poverty and inequality by fabulously wealthy people, then you'll probably like this movie.  <br /> <br />If you're more grounded in reality, give it a pass.
B000BCE9BI|5.0|I love these movies with Will Smith! They are action packed with a touch of romance and comedy! He is amazing.
B00005JPD0|4.0|If anyone remembers the movie timecop starring Jean claude van dam, then you will see a lot of similarities in the two movies. Both movies have the federal agent going back in time to alter a crime, and just so happen to save a woman. The difference between the two is that deja vu is a better version with better actors and a better plot. Even though the plot isn't totally original it still manages to entertain and make you wonder what will happen next. The movie is very good (as most of denzel's movies usually are) and is highly recommended.

6305609705|5.0|Apocalypse now is a good look at the Vietnam war. Characters like Lance Willard Kurtz and Kilgore are memorable. The trip up river is a rollercoaster of emotions. Playing ride of the valkryes during the attack on the village was one of the best uses of classical music since 2001. The dialouge between Kurtz and Willard is the best Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando ever did. This movie is a thriller i recomand it.
B00005JPD0|4.0|Denzel Washington plays an ATF agent who takes a case of a ferry explosion full of Navy sailors and their families on a getaway.  He soon finds the body of a woman whose death was called in before the explosion happened.  Washington takes it upon himself to find out how this woman died with very few clues.  He meets up with a super secret branch of the FBI whose has a project wherein they can see 4 days in the past.  They can delve into the inner most secrets and conversations.  With this ability, he puts together the clues needed to find her killer.  He soon realizes he may actually be able to save the woman using the technology shown him.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, this movie does require a healthy amount of suspension of disbelieve.  It's a touch of sci-fi, a little bit of fantasy, and a heck of a lot of action.  Denzel Washington ([[ASIN:B00005JKED Training Day]]/[[ASIN:0800177967 Glory]]) is always a pleasure and excitement to watch.<br /><br />With a combination of the always brilliant (well most of the time) Tony Scott, ([[ASIN:B0007PALT8 Man on Fire (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]/[[ASIN:B00006FDCF True Romance - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]) the story holds some water and makes for a decent, edge-of-your-seat thriller.  A nice twist on a car chase, a special nod to the aura of time travel, and some pretty nice camera work and effects.<br /><br />This is a very well done movie which is one of the best, and most fun films I've seen in quite some time.<br /><br />Watch and enjoy!
0743298020|3.0|I did enjoy this book. It was a quick read for me, but I didn't feel there was anything beneath the surface. I felt the whole twin/sibling angle was a bit played out and overdone...especially considering the ending, which I felt was a bit of a cop-out. I liked the back-and-forth between narratives, but I felt Margaret's story was too weak to compare to the one Vida was telling. At the end, I was left with a lot of questions about the characters. I realize that the author wanted to leave it open-ended, but I felt it never really delved into the personalities of the twins. Overall, it was a decent read, but I'm not in any hurry to recommend it to anyone.
B00005V9IL|5.0|I'm a harsh critic, and most films do not get 5 stars from me.  But The Abyss deserves them--it's not just a great sci-fi film, it's a great film, period.  Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are both superb (although Harris does go over the top at least once), and the scene in which Mastriantonio drowns is incredibly emotional.  What amazes me is how many movies this is, all wrapped into one, and how it moves from one to another so inexorably.  It starts out as a cold war thriller, becomes a deep sea rescue, turns into a study of a failed relationship, and there's hardly even a touch of the science fiction element until far into the film.  Perhaps that is what the Amazon reviewer means when he calls it 'slow-moving'--but most assuredly, slow-moving it is not.  And when the science-fiction element begins, there is a great sense of wonder.  This movie owes a lot to Close Encounters--Cameron recreates Spielberg's look, with all the pretty lights, and his lanky aliens, and his giant glowing mothership, and the hallucinatory quest to get there, but in a much darker and, of course, wetter way.  But its not merely Close Encounters Under Water, and whether you see the original or the longer directors cut--and each has it's own rewards--it's definitely a movie not to miss.  Heck, even the Amazon reviewer who thought it was slow moving has it as an \\"essential video'.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|It's impossible to deny the enormous talents of director Alfonso Cuaron....when my daughter was young, I purchased a DVD (then a video) of \\"A Little Princess\\" not having the first clue as to who the director was....this film is simply beautiful, the costumes and sets are gorgeous, the children cast were all gorgeous, the story faithful to the novel, sweet without being cloying, the fanciful scenes accompanying Sarah's story-telling are terrific; an early indication of the accomplished film-maker that Cuaron would become.  \\"Children of Men\\" is nothing short of astonishing....I completely agree with the reviewers of Entertainment Weekly magazine who stated that \\"Children of Men\\" was \\"shamelessly overlooked at awards season\\"; so true.  I had it pegged as the winner for Best Cinematography at the very least, and alas, it did not even win that category.  A shame, because to me, it was one of the most beautiful films of 2006; the look of the film is amazing; just gorgeous.  The bonus materials are terrific, too.....interesting, informative, and in the case of how they filmed that terrific sequence in the car when it is attacked in the woods, there's a great \\"how we did that\\" bit on the bonus material disc.....To me this film is an example of film as art; it's a work of art. Cuaron's skill has reached it's peak.....after \\"Little Princess\\" we had another glimpse of the brilliant film-maker he would become when he delivered the third film in the Harry Potter series and it, too, was artfully and fancifully done; a radical departure from Chris Columbus' safe, somewhat predictable, style.  And now he has given us \\"Children of Men\\".  I can't wait to see his career continue to develop; I'm anxious to see what he will give us next.  The acting is great - Clive Owen is terrific, Michael Caine is reliably good, Julianne Moore's part is kind of small, but she does it convincingly and well.....I found myself tearing up a couple of times which was unexpected when the film first began.The ending really got me; it was just such a satisfying film-going experience.  Should have made it onto many more \\"Best of\\" lists for 2006.  Love the DVD presentation.
B00005JPP6|4.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, because - quite frankly - hot is my favorite temperature fuzz.  Plus, I had quite enjoyed \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", whose creative contributors mostly return for this high-powered send-up of action flick conventions.  And \\"Hot Fuzz\\" delivers, for the most part, on its promise (before the fur starts flying a little too much at the end).<br /><br />\\"Shaun\\" hero Simon Pegg plays Nick Angel, the too-competent cop whose curve-busting efficacy gets him dispatched (or is that demoted?) to rural enclave Sandford, who take their Village of the Year status VERY seriously.  Once there, things get a little, er, hairy for the fuzz when people start turning up dead under what appear to be accidental circumstances (to everyone but Angel).  Some of these deaths are fairly gruesome, like when the local Romeo turns up decaffeinated (or is that decapitated?) and the Fridge Magnate (heh) gets a little fried after his overindulgence at a local pub.<br /><br />The ensemble cast seems to be really enjoying themselves on this film, and from the biggest to the smallest of roles, the performances are all fantastic.  Timothy Dalton has a great time hamming it up as the super-smarmy supermarket owner who drops weirdly suspicious and too-overt-to-be-true clues (\\"my discounts are criminal\\") with every other utterance.  And while some of the one-liners fall flat (\\"we're up to our balls in jugglers\\" - groan) and some of the action sequences go on a bit too long, Hot Fuzz is still a satisfyingly satiric romp before it ultimately devolves into the silliness of its three-endings-too-many (which, granted, is yet another send up of an action movie cliche, but I still feel the movie could have been made better by being just a little bit shorter).
B00006JDVV|2.0|Okay, it's got great visuals; in fact, they should have had MORE HELICOPTERS and just called this Dragons Versus Helicopters, and done without the plot altogether.  Because the plot is...sad to stay...stupid.  And when I use that word, I don't mean just a little bit stupid, but way, way stupid.  Gosh, it sure was lucky for humanity that there was only the ONE male dragon, and that the females were sort of hive support for it.  Just...why did it take through the downfall of the entirely of world civilization to find this out?  And why was he so easy to kill once we'd found him?  And on and on.<br /><br />So okay, if you're going to spend that much money on the special effects, why not blow a few more bucks on the scriptwriters and not second guess them?  This is a movie to watch, for sure, but...with the sound OFF.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|One of the pleasant surprises of 2006 is the \\"come back\\" of Sylvester Stallone, or Rocky Balboa, in his sixth and probably the final chapter that began back in 1976. The sixth \\"Rocky\\" film, or simply \\"Rocky Balboa,\\" turned out much better than people had expected, if not as great as the first Oscar-winning one which is now part of American movie history. <br /> <br />Rocky Balboa, now retired, and running a restraint, steps into the ring for the last time. It's an exhibition match against Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), current heavy weight champion whose unpopularity is part of the reasons behind the match in Las Vegas. I am afraid the story is not as plausible as it should be, not because of the age of the star or Rocky himself, (who still looks in good shape), but because even the former champion like Rocky, I think, would have to fight his way more than the film describes, before the bout against the champion. The film's script is rushed at certain places like the relations between Rocky and his son, or the training scenes before the match. <br /> <br />Still I liked \\"Rocky Balboa\\" for one reason. It is that Stallone, truly in character, delivers one of his best acting as Rocky, clearly aged, but still with dignity. The strength of the film is the character of Rocky himself, whose honesty and good-natured personality is exactly what makes this film special. There is no Adrian any more, but Stallone wisely brought back little girl Marie from the original, who is now living with her son. Geraldine Hughes is impressive as grown-up Marie, whose quiet interaction with Rocky reminds us of what he was like in the first Rocky film, where budding romance between him and Adrian played the major part of the story. <br /> <br />The film is not flawless. The use of archive footages from the previous Rocky films is too much for me, and sometimes the film gets too sentimental. Still I think \\"Rocky Balboa\\" with moving moments and inspirational messages, is winner, if it is not aknockout. <br />
B000IHYY52|5.0|This disc is a must-own if you like Jazz and have a Blu-ray player.  The video is outstanding, but the audio will blow you away. <br /> <br />The entire disc is in Dolby TrueHD, so you get 100% lossless audio.  It is pristine.
B00005JPPL|2.0|Here's an idea: let's all spend 8 dollars to go to the movies, only instead of watching the movie let's all fall asleep and dream about what the ending should be. And then when we wake up in the middle of the movie, we can walk out of the theater, because we already know how it's going to end, or at least we think we do. <br /> <br />In a sense, that's what you get with watching Next. An okay movie overall, it's just the ending sort of leaves you the feeling that \\"it was all just a dream\\". We never really know why Cage can see 2 minutes into future when it involves just him (okay, he was born with it, so what?) or why when he is with Jessica Biel he can see much longer into the future, nor why he would need to in the first place. Unless he's insecure and needs to know what he can do to control the emotions of the woman of his dreams (aka, the diner scene in the middle of the movie). So now we go from an insecure guy to a domineering puppet master that can manipulate action, thought, and emotion in almost every scenario; not much of a likeable person, now is he? <br /> <br />And what of the end? Did it happen, will it happen, how does it happen? Nobody knows for sure; you're just left feeling \\"that's it?\\" For a movie about being able to see what happens Next, you really don't get to see what happens Next.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I read and LOVED the book, then listened to the CD, and then saw the show. All 3 experiences were great. Actually, I thought that the CD was BETTER than the live music, because my favorite part of the music was the bass and percussion, which were way too quiet at the actual performance (4/07) It's a great record, though, can't get it out of my head...
B00026WU3M|5.0|Produced by Daniel Lanois, this graceful work was Dylan's final statement of the 1980s. The uptempo Political World delivers a profound message over an urgent rolling rhythm whilst the poignant Where Teardrops Fall is melancholy and uplifting at the same time, very much like Leonard Cohen.<br /><br />Since this album was released in 1989, the song Everything Is Broken now seems to be prophetic and truer than ever. The arrangement stands out, as well as the impressive instrumental textures. With its appealing organ touches, the slow song Ring Them Bells has an anthemic quality and gospel undertones.<br /><br />The atmospheric story-song Man In The Long Black Coat is followed by the introspective Most Of The Time, a reflection upon lost love and lingering memories. What Good Am I is similarly sad and reflective with thought-provoking lyrics, and the same goes for Disease Of Conceit.<br /><br />I love the appearance of the harmonica on some of the songs like Shooting Star; it reminds me of his legendary 1960s work. With its heavenly melodies, evocative imagery and inspired production by Lanois, Oh Mercy is Dylan at his very best.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002C2E Time Out of Mind]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0009K7RA2 Acadie by Daniel Lanois]]
1582701709|5.0|After seeing the book discussed on Oprah I was anxious to see what it was all about. The book is a quick read but it should not be read quickly. Take time to let each passage soak in. It is a life changing book.
B000H305U0|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD. I love it.  Smooth sound and great rhythm.
B000BB14YY|5.0|adapted from 'the tempest' and 'king lear'. similar to 'the lion in winter'. the movie is a little bit too long, but well done through and through. it happened in every nation's history and it's still happening nowadays around the world. now you know why queen elizabeth in england never let go of her sovereignty to prince charles or prince wales or whoever next to take over her kingdom, no matter it's just a symbolized kingship or queenship. never let go before you die. she indeed learned well from shakespear(?) and, she might have watched and read all the above mentioned dramas or movies too.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|First thing that caught my attention of the SB-400 is its small size. When mounted on my Nikon D40x, the unit does not impose itself on the camera body. Aesthetics aside, the quality of the flash is super. The unit can be tilted at various angles upto 90 degrees for the \\"bounce\\" effect. Pictures come out clear and light is thrown evenly across the subject(s). It syncs very well with the camera and can use any type of AA sized batteries. With the SB-400 mounted, less power is consumed from the camera battery itself. Something to keep in mind.<br /><br />I am very happy with the purchase. For the casual photographer, the unit provides more than ample support. You can't go wrong.
B000CBSHK2|3.0|Comfort of Strangers sits next to all my other Beth Orton albums in my iTunes playlist (Trailer Park, Central Reservation, Daybreaker), and it never gets listened to unless I do a listen-through of Central Reservation and then forget to switch to something else once Comfort of Strangers follows.  Despite multiple listens, these songs are just not growing on me in the way that all of Orton's other albums that I own did.  Even Daybreaker, which I found originally to not be as captivating as Central Reservation, is well-loved by this point.
B0000AUHPK|3.0|Not to say that Ralph and Juliette are not fantastic actors in their own right, they are just not Cathy and Heathcliff.  This production lacked so much of the novel's mood, that it just seemed esthetically boring.  I personally would never hire that cinematographer again if I were the director/producer.  I have YET to see a film version of Wuthering Heights that can do justice to Emily's art.  I am not under some naive assumption that movies based on novels always turn out great (just look at Stephen King movies - BLECH!) - however we all thought that The Lord of the Rings could never be done properly, and then Peter Jackson came along to wow us all.  It CAN be done with Wuthering Heights as well, and the great thing about it is, it would require no special effects.  Just a great director, a better script adaption, and some actors who have chemistry - unlike the two in this one.  They may be great, but again, they are no Heathcliff and Cathy.  I really wish someone would get this right.  Turn it into a miniseries ala Pride and Prejudice BBC style.   Maybe they could get Clive Owen to play Heathcliff..... he would be a great one.  Tall, dark, brooding, dangerously handsome.  Perfect Heathcliff.  Grrrrrrrrr.... ok enough of my Clive Owen fantasies.   <br /> <br />Seriously though, it is the best adaptation so far, but not even close to being perfect.  Filmmakers need to stop trying to turn this into a 90 minute theater picture and do it right with a BBC miniseries that has some meat to it, just like the novel. Look what they did with Jane Eyre! I really did not care much for the novel or anything else Charlotte tried to do, but they did a great job with that one. I actually loved it. <br /> <br />Someone.... PLEASE make Emily proud.
0517123207|5.0|Many reviewers start with the warning that this is primarily a scientific <br />work, and therefore a casual reader may find it difficult to read.  I would <br />take quite the opposite view: given that this _is_ a scientific work, <br />comparable in its impact to Newton's Principia, it is a surprisingly  <br />easy and lively read.  While the text is a bit dry, and the numerous examples <br />may seem overwhelming, I still found Darwin to be a gifted writer, and his choice <br />of examples enlightening, and entertaining (this is the first time I read about <br />ants that enslave other ants, for instance). I wish <br />that modern scholarly works in biology, or any other science, were <br />written nearly as well as the \\"Origin of Species.\\" <br /> <br />Even so, it is difficult to give this book a rating.  It's impact on the view we  <br />have of ourselves as a species is so enormous that judging the literary <br />merrits of the book is, perhaps, beside the point.  Darwin's amazing prescience, <br />and the thoughtfulness in presenting an \\"abstract\\" of his argument for <br />descent with modifications are awe inspiring.

1400064287|4.0|Stickiness is okay if you have the luxury of time. But irresistable ideas have an immediate wallop. It's the difference between Ted Williams' batting average and Babe Ruth's punch. Get on base, or clear the bases!<br /><br />People push back. People actively resist change. Quite a few, especially narcissists in management, are hostile and aggressive towards subordinates with clever ideas. Clever ideas are a threat.<br /><br />So you need to find ways to direct their energy into your bat to blast your idea up into the cheap seats. Your idea can die a lonely death if it gets no further than 3rd base.<br /><br />Consider reading the papers of Milton Erickson MD. He was The Man when it comes to getting people to embrace new ideas.
B000268QB2|5.0|I am amazed by the number of excellent musical elements that come together in Keane's debut album. It is highly modern and refreshing with its unusual combination of piano and drums, with a male lead singer who is emotive without being warped. Yet its modern sound and themes are accompanied by echoes of the past. 'Everybody's Changing' reminds me a great deal of 1980s Brit-pop, with Tom Chaplin's melancholic falsetto and a slightly mechanical regularity in its arrangement. But it doesn't get too mechanical, which is great. So it comes across as having an exquisite simplicity and sincerity, and I can really relate to its main idea of everyone in this modern world constantly being in a state of flux - changing jobs, moving between social circles, climbing the corporate ladder - and how difficult it is for human relationships to have any constancy. <br /> <br />'Somewhere Only We Know' is one of those rare songs that combines great depth of meaning and mass appeal. It expresses a desire for a space to call one's own and to share with someone special, away from the maddening crowds. It expresses a desire for simplicity and calm in today's crazy complexity. \\"Oh simple thing, where have you gone?\\" Exactly. \\"This could be the end of everything.\\" Exactly. <br /> <br />The romantic sentiments of sharing a beautiful private space are echoed in the most artistic song of the album - 'Bedshaped', a true modern masterpiece. \\"Many's the time I ran with you down/ The rainy roads of our old town/ Many the lives we lived in each day/ And buried altogether.\\" The song is deeply haunting - Chaplin's voice mourns, then soars. It is also accompanied by some stunning choral singing. However, the sadness is illuminated by a deep passion for life and love. <br /> <br />Keane has Coldplay's emotional depth, but I love it that Keane doesn't  get overly intellectual or depressingly heavy except perhaps in 'She Has No Time'. There is generally a lively, defiant spring in Keane's musical step. Ican feel that a deep love of life, and a positive view of human experience underlie the apparent sadness and disappointment in the music of this great band. This liveliness and faith in life become even stronger in their second album 'Under the Iron Sea'.
B000O75F7C|3.0|I agree with another reviewer who felt that Steven Wilson might be spreading himself too thin. His creative efforts are being dispersed amongst all of his numerous collaborations. Though I admire his musical overactivity, I believe it has affected the latest PT release this time around. The songs in general are good but not great. Lacking any real memorable moments. For a band that has set such high standards, this one falls a little short.
1558908846|4.0|Judge Dredd was one of those big budget action films that was aiming high, but ended up bombing and getting ridiculed, and forgotten quite fast.  Movies like The Shadow and The Phantom also fell victim to this.  I sometimes have a soft spot for these overblown superhero movies that fail miserably.  While Judge Dredd isn't great(I could strangle Rob Schneider), it's kinda fun in that cheesy way.  You can say what you want about Stallone, but he played the part cold and lifeless coz I'm assuming that's how the character is.  I don't know how accurate an adaptation the film is coz my knowledge of Judge Dredd lore is limited to Anthrax's I Am The law song.  I will say Armand Assante makes for a pretty cool villain and the robot is rather impressive.  It looks like a cross of cgi and animatronics, which is a combo severely lacking in movies.  Storywise, it's rather cliche and predictable(tell me you didn't figure out the villain behind the chaos ten minutes into the film), but what comic-action movie isn't?  Judge Dredd may go down in history as a bloated failure for Stallone, director Cannon, and movies in general, but it's all the more fun for it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let me just say that I have family members that own over 40 different boxed sets of TV series - from \\"The A-Team\\" to \\"Quantum Leap\\" to \\"24\\".  Now, I watched \\"24\\", and still do, and even \\"Lost\\", but I can't imagine ever sitting down to watch the whole season over again after seeing it through once.  So what would I benefit from buying the boxed set? <br /> <br />Then my wife's uncle lent us his copy of \\"Firefly\\", and it sat on our shelf for months, I thought the premise sounded neat, but just wasn't sure I wanted to take the time to watch 14 episodes of ... what?  Well, then Serenity came out and a lot of talk went on about it.  So I saw the movie.  Well, after that, I had to see what the series had started out as, so my wife and I hunkered down for a first episode.  Two days later, we were finished, and aching for more.  <br /> <br />I started reading on the web about the series demise, and waited anxiously to get the Serenity DVD to make the collection complete.  Recently, we just finished watching the series and the movie again all the way through, and again, I'm left with a sinking feeling that I won't see this kind of TV ever again.  I'm glad I own this series on DVD.
B000MR9D5E|2.0|Overall, I was very pleased with the discs.  However, I did find what I consider to be a major flaw.  At the Main Menu if I click on Play All the disc plays flawlessly.  However, if I select a specific item, e.g. \\"Caves\\", it loads up properly but it does not play 'seamlessly'. I am then given pictures of each chapter.  I must click on each \\"chapter\\" in order to see the entire item.  I find this to be very confusing and bothersome.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me just how many fine singer/songwriters (particularly female artists) continue to emanate from the United States and Canada - it must be something to do with the North American psyche; 'The Story' is yet another outstanding example of this genre.<br /><br />This album is described as 'live' - but this doesn't mean 'live in front of an audience', it means 'studio live' (i.e. without any post-recording electronic enhancements to 'paper over the cracks'); but fear not, it is almost 'perfect' without such embellishments and, anyway, this gives the music a very natural and authentic feel.<br /><br />The general mood of the album is introspective and sombre (but not excessively so) and, if the album has any weakness, I'd say it was the lack of variability in mood. There is a mixture of slow to mid-tempo songs and, although there are no up-tempo songs to speak of, all have captivating, lilting melodies to ensure that the the album doesn't sound dour and gloomy. Instrumental accompaniment, on most tracks, combines semi-acoustic passages with the further addition of electric guitars and keyboards in others, and a couple of tracks also feature cello. Guitar accompaniment is provided by BC's longtime musical cohorts - Phil and Tim Hanseroth (plus BC herself on acoustic guitar). The smooth and rich harmony vocals also come courtesy of the 'twins' and BC (and, the 'Indigo Girls' on 'Cannonball').<br /><br />BC has a wonderfully clear and resonant voice with just a hint of grittiness; it's a unique voice also - with traces of Patsy Cline, Joan Baez, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris (but with an 'earthier' texture than any of these singers - other reviewers have made comparisons with Janis Joplin, Bonnie Raitt and Stevie Nicks). There is a lot of 'slow burning' passion and intensity about her singing which frequently features controlled changes in pitch (something that would be difficult to achieve for a lesser singer) - I think the comparison with Roy Orbison, made by at least one other reviewer, is very apt. It isn't easy to categorize her music - 'americana' with a slight 'indie' edge on some tracks, perhaps ?<br /><br />I liked all of the tracks, here are some brief comments about selected ones (songwriters in brackets); please bear in mind that any comments about the lyrics are my personal interpretations only - they are not meant to be prescriptive :<br /><br />LATE MORNING LULLABY (Brandi Carlile) - A song about shunning the 'real world' and seeking refuge in dreams. The song has a more 'poppy' character (and I mean this in a positive way) than most others.<br /><br />THE STORY (Phil Hanseroth) - Reflections on a love lost and the loneliness that ensues. BC's voice breaks when changing pitch before the final chorus, but who cares ? - a minor flaw in some 50 minutes worth of otherwise quality music from a quality singer (and remember, this is a 'studio live' album).<br /><br />MY SONG (Brandi Carlile) - A song with lyrics about having regrets for past mistakes made; without a doubt, this is an emotionally highly-charged song (the last verse in particular, when BC really bares her soul and 'gives it all she's got'). There's some amazing percussion also, towards the end of this song.<br /><br />HAVE YOU EVER (Phil Hanseroth) - A gentle song with a very 'folksy' sound and a somewhat 'lighter' mood.<br /><br />JOSEPHINE (Tim Hanseroth & Brandi Carlile) - A forlorn love song; features acoustic guitar and very subdued bass - no percussion; sublime harmony vocals. A song which is exquisite in it's simplicity.<br /><br />AGAIN TODAY (Brandi Carlile) - For the first 3 minutes or so, this is a quiet song featuring synthesizers warbling and humming away in the background. After this, the sound becomes more strident as pulsating electric guitars 'kick in' - the effect is very dramatic. Although the track registers at 10:40, 'Again Today' is just under 5 minutes long; at 7 minutes into the track, a 'hidden' song commences(I think it's called 'Hiding My Heart').<br /><br />If you like the music of any of the other artists mentioned in this review or, if you like some of the more contemporary 'alt-folk/alt-country' music that is surfacing these days, then I recommend that you, at least, give this album a listen. BC is virtually unknown in the UK and I don't know how popular she is in the US, so I can't be sure whether this album would have a wide appeal or not; I'd describe it as 'grown up music for grown ups' - I'm a 'grown up' (although my wife might sometimes dispute this) and it certainly appeals to me; 4.5 stars.(I think it's called 'Hiding My Heart').<br /><br />If you like the music of any of the other artists mentioned in this review or, if you like some of the more contemporary 'alt-folk/alt-country' music that is surfacing these days, then I recommend that you, at least, give this album a listen.

B00003OSU4|5.0|This is a beautiful looking film.  Stern was essentially a photographer who got ahold of film equipment and was able to document this event (the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival).  The sheer quality of the images (keep in mind it was 1958) really reflect Stern's true calling as a photographer.  That being said, no, he is not a filmmaker by trade; if you are looking for a masterful film, look elsewhere; if you are looking for footage of the jazz musicians, by themsleves, isolated from the experience of playing to an audience, look elsewhere.  However, if you want a great looking document portraying the experience of great jazz musicians playing to a crowd in 1958, and what it really looked and felt like, this is the film you must own.  In my opinion, the opening scenes of Jimmy Guiffre playing (a vastly underrated jazz legend) are enough to get someone hooked.  Lastly, this is one of the times when the DVD-format really shows its advantages in terms of sound.  It's fantastic, and really captures the experience of this 1958 event like nothing else.
1582701709|5.0|I've long ago needed this book. <br />I feel I know myself very well, and would have previously found this book on the fluffy side, but I enjoyed it, and highly recommend it, if for no other reason than lightening the soul's load for a moment.
B000O75F7C|4.0|I have been a huge Porcupine Tree fan for a while and I was really excited for this album to come out.  After \\"Deadwing\\" I was expecting something a little more similiar to that, but I was hoping for them to go back to their Lightbulb Sun and Stupid Dream ways of making music.  As I expected, they came back with something pretty similiar to \\"Deadwing.\\"  After a few listens, this is what I have come up with: <br /> <br />First off, I must say that the lyrical content is great; the theme is something that I'm sure a lot of people can connect with.  While it is in my opinion not the best, it is still great and deserving of any praise.  This is also probably one of Porcupine Tree's darkest albums in terms of over all musicality.   <br /> <br />Okay, now for the criticism.  I really think that \\"Anesthetize\\" isn't that great of a song.  The opening doesn't hook the listener (well at least it didn't hook me), the major bulk of the song just seemed to get really repetitive, and the riffs didn't showcase Porcupine Tree's trademark of making beautiful melodies.  This could have been forgiven if the song was a giant build up to a captivating and melodic song closer, but sadly this was not the case.  I was disappointed to say the least.  Another thing I personally didn't really like was the lack of an up-lifting sounding song.  I am a huge supporter of depressing songs, but Porcupine Tree just does too great of a job with happier songs to not include one on the album.   <br /> <br />After having said all of that, I think that every other track besides \\"Anesthetize\\" was great; this track weighed down the album in my opinion.  The album was most definitely worth the money and I am in no way regretting my decision of buying it, I just know Porcupine Tree is capable of so much more.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|The ovation Villazon receives brings him to tears. The kiss between the two leads at the end was as much Anna and Rolando as it was Adina and Nemorino - it moved me to well up a little to see their real love for each other on stage. <br /> <br />It is clear that they had a lot of fun with this performance and let their own personalities shine through. One reviewer has mentioned the 'unbridled silliness' of Netrebko after her duet with D'Arcangelo - I have seen her performance of I Puritani recently as a video broadcast from the Met... she does the same sort of thing offstage - skipping about and tossing her skirts! It's really rather endearing.  <br /> <br />The DVD doesn't offer much more in the way of special features, there is only a short character identification piece offered. And for this price that is just fine. The sound is good. The lighting was the only thing in the whole production that I could nit-pick about. But I won't! I bought the disc for two reasons only - Netrebko and Villazon and that's exactly what was delivered. I couldn't have asked for more!
B000N3T0DW|3.0|With a lusty, no-nonsense manner to complement her sensual allure, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz seems to be channeling Sophia Loren (especially in Vittorio de Sica's [[ASIN:B000007SFB Two Women]]) as Raimunda, an airport cleaning woman who finds her life turned upside down by unexpected death, possible ghosts and a thriving restaurant in Pedro Almodovar's 2006 film. A curious mix of absurdist comedy and melodrama with a touch of the surreal, it plays out like a cross between an old Warner Brothers women's picture (like Michael Curtiz's [[ASIN:B0008ENIAC Mildred Pierce]]) and de Sica's lighter social comedies from the 1960's (like [[ASIN:B000A59QOG Marriage Italian Style]]) but with Almodovar's particularly askew perspective and his trademark use of saturated bright colors.<br /><br />The meandering film focuses on a close group of women, most prominently Raimunda and her timid hairdresser sister Sole, who shuttle between Madrid, where they live, and La Mancha, the central region where they buried their parents who died recently in a fire. Their frail Aunt Paula blithely claims that their late mother Irene has been taking care of her, and sickly neighbor Agustina, who is looking for her own runaway mother, corroborates Paula's seemingly preposterous belief in Irene's presence. However, with an adolescent daughter and a beer-guzzling, unemployed husband to look after, Raimunda has big problems of her own which lead to dire consequences and test her aptitude for self-sufficiency. Meanwhile, Sole gets a not altogether unexpected visitor.<br /><br />Their stories eventually converge into a revelation that surprisingly lacks the resonance to bring all the plot elements together (probably because the same revelation has been used more effectively in other films). Almodovar's Baroque-level touches are everywhere from the candy-colored palette to the overly convenient plot turns to the attention on Cruz's cleavage and artificially bulbous behind. The elements just seem more contrived within a narrative that lacks the emotional power and propulsive pacing of previous works like [[ASIN:B00005JLQW Talk to Her]] or the similarly themed [[ASIN:0767847105 All About My Mother]]. Regardless, Cruz is a far more interesting actress in her native tongue as she is given a fully dimensional character to play and even a chance to sing (albeit dubbed).<br /><br />Though somewhat overshadowed by Cruz's buxom presence, the remaining cast is solid with Almodovar regular Carmen Maura a gravitating presence as Irene, Lola Due&ntilde;as effortlessly bringing the insecurity out of Sole and Yohana Cabo as Raimunda's unusually becalming daughter Paula. The 2007 DVD is chock full of extras beginning with the engaging if lightweight commentary by Almodovar (with occasional participation from Cruz) spoken in Spanish and subtitled in English. There are more in-depth interviews with Almodovar, Cruz and Maura. There is also the inevitable making-of featurette and a meandering interview between Cruz and a rather smitten Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan at the 2006 AFI Film Festival screening. Almodovar's films are always worth watching, but from my perspective, this is one of his more modest efforts and more of a star vehicle for Cruz.within a narrative that lacks the emotional power and propulsive pacing of previous works like [[ASIN:B00005JLQW Talk to Her]] or the similarly themed [[ASIN:0767847105 All About My Mother]].

B000O178BY|2.0|ok, first, completely missed this album's release.  I mean, Trent releasing something new in under 5 years?  That's just crazy talk.  Then heard it was a concept album about the end of the world.........uhm, OK, interesting.  But, not knocking it, Trent does his own thing, it could be like another Queensryche, Operation Mindcrime, can't knock it until I try it.  Then, heard that he had toned down the drinking and drugs while touring.  My reaction, ok, clear head, we could be onto something good here. <br /> <br />Then I listened to it. <br /> <br />WTF!!!???? <br /> <br />Too artsy for me.  Can see where he was going with it, but.........don't know, i just don't get it.  Someone had previously said that there is no one stand out single on this, that you have to look at it as a whole.  Personally, I would've loved a single or two to get behind.  Have to give Trent credit, presenting a situation and being able to write tunes behind the various viewpoints, that's pretty cool.  and, great sounding.   <br /> <br />Don't know, can't put my finger on it, but this just does nothing for me.  I'm hoping this is a one time experimental thing or something.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|this is a very good movie. it's a good Drama and brad pit plays an awesome role. The only problem i have with it that most of it was in subtitles, nonthless it was a good drama.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Fear of a Blank Planet is way out of here!  Easily five stars.  Steve and the boys are brilliant.  The song \\"Way Out of Here\\" is simply porcupine tree at their best.  The lyrics are socialy accurate.  The whole frickin' CD is socially accurate.  There is not a better band on the scene...
B000M4RG4C|5.0|This is an awesome movie and a good history flick. Clint Eastwood did a awesome job directing it. It's also very sad and war graphic. if you can't handel gore i recomend that you don't see it. all in all it's a good movie.
B000F1IQMS|5.0|I caught part of this movie on HBO.  I was spellbound by the part I saw and wanted to see the whole film.  I have, several times.  This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  In my opinion, there are many, many mediocre to poor quality films out there. This film is not one of them.  This film is intelligent, well-crafted, riveting film-making at its best. <br /> <br />This film starts out at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, where USA athletes returning to their Olympic village apartments after a late night of it, unwittingly/innocently help terrorists climb over the fence surrounding the village, thinking they are Olympic athletes who need help getting back to their rooms.  So begins the hostage taking and murder of 11 Israeli athletes that made world-wide news. <br /> <br />Golda Mier, Prime Minister of Israel, Israeli military and government leaders meet and it is decided to hunt down and kill, one by one, the men responsible for the Munich massacre.  Enter Eric Bana and crew, including Daniel Craig, who are assigned the task.  I agree with another reviewer who said this is a psychological thriller.  There is plenty of action though. <br /> <br />As they hunt down and assassinate the Munich masterminds, eventually they become hunted themselves.  I guess one message of this film is that violence begets violence.  I don't really think Steven Spielberg is making a political statement with this film.  The closing film credits show that this movie is based on the book, \\"Vengeance\\" by George Jonas.  I think it shows us the never-ending back and forth between two peoples who think they are both righteous.  Also, Eric Bana's character presents himself as an American representing American businessmen wanting the information on the Munich masterminds.  That was just a front.  He was an Israeli representing Israeli interests. <br /> <br />The closing shot of Avner (Eric Bana) and Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) walking away from each other - what we see in the background speaks volumes without saying a word.  You'll see what I mean. <br /> <br />This is also just my opinion, but I'd like to add that the French actor portraying Louie, I think his name is Mathieu Amalric, if they ever make a movie about the life of Roman Polanski, he could play the part.  Something about him reminded me of Polanski, even though Amalric is better looking by far. <br />
B000M341QO|1.0|for such a great cast, nicholson, Dicaprio & Damon this movie sucked the ending sucked the whole thing sucked. and i like all these actors. i don't know why jack signed up for this crappy movie. Leonardo i can see why for not making any nmovies for a long while. and matt who knows. But all in all it was boriing confusing and bad.
1582701709|1.0|If there were zero stars, I would rate it zero.<br /><br />First of all, not only is this not a \\"secret,\\" (Power of Postive Thinking, Affirmations, Buddhist concept of \\"right thought\\", Create Your Own Reality - sound familiar?), but obviously it hasn't been kept from people at all.  I will agree that positive thinking can *help* you - it does affect your interactions with people; a positive outlook has been shown also to have a positive effect on things like blood pressure, immune response and the like.  But The Secret goes way, way too far.  The Secret claims that simple positive thinking literally will fix everything.  Life is just not that simple, folks.  Quit being lazy and looking for an easy way out.<br /><br />Secondly, I find the whole concept that bad things happen to people because that's what was in their thoughts utterly offensive and perverse.  The people in this film were insistent that every single time your thoughts and what happens to you match up.<br /><br />Furthermore, they claimed that the universe was governed by \\"one law, the Law of Attraction\\", that everything in the universe is about attraction. This couldn't be further from the truth. As my friend pointed out, \\"what about the law of 'opposites attract?'\\" Also, like charges repel each other; they don't attract. Last but definitely not least - the very fact that the attractive force of gravity is much weaker than the repulsive strong and weak forces is why the universe has the form it has today. If not for the forces pushing neutrons and protons away from each other, the atomic nucleus would collapse. Matter as it is today would not exist. This changes the entire universe. It's actually more correct to say that the universe is governed by the Law of Repulsion.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This is a very good movie and a good meystery. Jackman & Bale are awsome in this movie. I really acn't say more that it was an awesome movie. oh, you have to pat attention to this film or you'll get lost.
0684857219|5.0|This book, just as it appears to, has everything you would need to know about any and all aspects of bodybuilding. The book itself is very well-organized to make it easy to navigate through it's pages and find what you want to read about.  It has routines for bodybuilders of all experience levels, featuring different programs for beginners, advanced lifters, and competitors.  Not only that, but you can find information on how to correctly perform each exercise, as well as inspiring pictures of famous body builders.  I wish, though, that the book had more information on Schwarznegger himself and his experiences. Overall, the book is very informative and a good read.  I strongly recommend this book if you are interested in bodybuilding.

B00004SZWD|5.0|I recently became a Stevie fan over the past year. Like most people, I have heard his songs all my life- well, I'm 21- so I guess like others around my age, and just grown accustom to them. But, recently I have REALLY listen to Stevie and became a fan. This man is so full of talent and it just oozes out when he creates music. <br />Song in the Key of Life is a great CD, because you get two CDs fully of Stevie genius!  At first listen, several of the songs will sound familiar, because unless you've been stuck in a cave somewhere your whole life, you have probably heard at least one or two of the songs. <br />I love the title of the CD is also genius. Once you listen to the CD you see that the songs on the CD cover many aspects of life, from love, family, hardships and some just funky songs!  <br />This CD and the songs withstand the time. The album was created in 1976 and so many of the songs are heard today and still hold up to the test of time. Many of the songs have also been remixed several times over the years by various artist.  <br />So, if  you're looking for a CD that will give you a good glimpse of the stuff that Stevie Wonder is made of, I think that this CD will do the job! So, get the CD and enjoy!
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Wow! I can't wait for this item to become pre order! Veronica Mars is the best tv show you're not watching!<br /><br />Received this is the mail a few weeks ago. I wish there were more Special Features on it. Or maybe I just wish for more Veronica Mars...<br /><br />The best episode has to be the Paul Rudd episode. But also love the episode where she catches the campus rapist.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is truly a great movie.  Although it can be a little hard to follow at times, even the younger veiwers will get the gist of it and enjoy it all the same.  Nausicaa tells the story of Princess Nausicaa who helps rule the valley of the wind, one of the last places for humans on earth.  This is because 1000 years ago the world was destroyed by war bringing on an onslaught of poisonous plants that covered the earth.  Peace loving Nausicaa desperately tries to find a way to restore human's connection with nature and bring an end to the war around her. <br />Despite the fact this movie is definitly one of the better decisions I've made in my life, I have to say I hate the music.  There are times when it can be completely corny, and almost ruined the movie for me.  To put it this way, it's the kind of music I'd expect to find in a video game as opposed to an epic movie like this.  Still, bad music can only do so much to ruin a movie, and it's still one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever come across.  Just watch out for that music...
B000N3SS80|3.0|JLo was well on the way of becoming the Marilyn Monroe of our time.  But like all sex symbols, JLo has entered a phase where she wants to be a serious artist.  So, she has released this collection of Spanish language ballads and marketed it as a return to her roots.  JLo--how do I put this?--these are not your roots.  Your roots are English speaking ballads and big dance productions with a hint of Latin rhythms.  While this collection is actually quite interesting, it is simply not JLo.  Que Hiciste is the highlight of the  collection which moves at a somewhat slow pace.  Many of these songs are good songs, but you just can't listen to one ballad after another.  Really, would it have killed someone to add a few uptempo numbers?  Without being critical, JLo's voice while at its best is a little weak on a few of the selections.  In short, if your looking for Waiting for Tonight, don't look here.  If, however, you prefer a few pleasant ballads  (all in Spanish), then this will work for you.  Hopefully, JLo will have gotten this out of her system and will move back to what she's best at.
B000FS9FCG|1.0|Oh jeez, how to begin to describe this pile of rubbish?<br /><br />Natalie Portman, as usual, manages to shine through the ridiculous premise of this movie, the illogical plotlines, and the hideously pious preaching of the current politically correct thinking of Hollywood.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving?  Does anybody even have proof that he was in this movie?  How do we know that it wasn't just David Prowse, or some other Darth Vader wannabe stiff taken off the actors' unemployment lines that was behind that Guy Fawkes mask?<br /><br />Hugo Weaving ACTING?  Give me a break.  His most outstanding acting abilities in previous movies have all been in his facial features, stern, menacing, and yet capable of compassion.<br /><br />Weaving's face is NEVER seen in this movie.  If that was him, what a waste of money and talent.  Waving your arms around, pointing your fingers here and there, and flinging knives, all the while wearing a mask, do not count as acting in my book - just about any high school level actor could have done this job.<br /><br />And as for all of this business about Britain being taken over by an evil conservative government with some sort of a pseudo-right wing Christian religious bent (which uses a double-cross symbol that somewhat resembles an Eastern Orthodox cross), come on, this is all Hollywood again.  Britain and Europe are now suffering from a severe DECLINE in religious beliefs everywhere except in the immigrant Muslim communities.  If there is a religion that is threatening the future well-being of Europeans, it is certainly not Christianity.  The Wachowski brothers are just doing the usual bigoted Christian bashing that has become so de rigueuer for Hollywood movies.<br /><br />Alan Moore, one of the creators of the original comic series on which this movie was based, had this to say about the movie:<br /><br />\\"[The movie] has been \\"turned into a Bush-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country.... It's a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by neoconservatives--which is not what the comic V for Vendetta was about. It was about fascism, it was about anarchy, it was about England.\\"<br /><br />I have to say, in reading about the original comic book version of V for Vendetta, that Moore's own vision was also terribly near-sighted.  The comic book was riding the 1980's era liberal British themes of anti-Thatcherism and anti-Reaganism, as well as fear of a nuclear war that would destroy Britain as the result of Reagan basing American nuclear missiles in Europe.<br /><br />None of those fears came to pass.  Britain was revitalized by Thatcher's socialism-busting policies and became an economically freer and far more vigorous nation.  The threat posed by the American nuclear missiles in Europe led to a landmark nuclear disarmament agreement with the Soviet Union.  Then the U.S.S.R. collapsed, as did the threat of Europe getting caught in an all-out nuclear war between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.  And in Britain, Thatcher's Conservative Party did eventually get replaced by Blair's Labor Party, but the Labor Party had to transform itself from a shrill advocate of the restrictive protections of socialism in order to get back into power, and it has never been the same again.<br /><br />Entirely different forces now threaten Britain and Europe, and they are not the ones depicted in this very, very vapid movie.<br /><br />Avoid.n liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by neoconservatives--which is not what the comic V for Vendetta was about.

1582701709|1.0|The secret could be delivered in a few paragraphs, instead of the same secret over and over and over, with what the previous reviewer said is, in my own words, advertising for seminar hosts.<br /><br />I've kept a journal of all my metaphysical readings, which totals over 65 books.

B0000ACY0Y|2.0|I love the Byrds and Gene Clark and this is supposed to be his Sargent Peppers, but it is just disjointed and almost boring.

0553582461|5.0|I must admit, I have been stunned.  The third book in the Tawny Man trilogy, Fool's Fate, has made sense of so much mystery that I am in awe.  It is without a doubt, the best book EVER written about Fitz, the best book I have ever read that Hobb has written, and perhaps one of the great fantasy books of modern times.<br /><br />Many of my earlier reviews have been overshadowed by what I considered \\"incongruities\\" in the story.  At times, what seemed like plot holes were actually fairly well laid out mysteries for us to uncover.  There are still many things I don't like about the way Fitz was developed and still a few things which to me are not satisfactorily explained, but this book is great, regardless.<br /><br />First of all, the book's pacing is excellent.  It is more or less an adrenaline rush from start to near the end, which is filled with exultation and gratification.  Action lovers can read this, and there are enough relationship stories to satisfy anyone.  If you could find a fault with this book it is that everything, all the loose ends are wrapped up TOO well, and every character you have ever read about is somehow involved in this ending.  Truly Hobb seems to want to bring to an end the events surrounding this world and this character.  I can imagine no further books from Fitz.<br /><br />This IS the book that explains the Farseer, Liveship, and Tawny Man trilogies.  This is the book the culminates all the details you've loved and cherished about the mysteries and magics of this world of dragons.  This is the book that gives a happy ending to a character many have grown to love.  And even if you haven't grown to love him exactly (like me) you will enjoy this.  And even if you think the Fool is an overrated character (like me) you will like this and you will like to find out his fate.<br /><br />IF you NEVER READ ANOTHER HOBB NOVEL, read this, because it is truly great, and worthy of the adoration of so many.  I don't care how you felt about ANY of her other books, don't give up on her.  This book proves her prowess with the written word...  And I can't believe I'm saying this.<br /><br />This is the book that transformed a skeptic into a believer.of her other books, don't give up on her.

B000068PQ7|4.0|I have always been a major Byrds fan and yet I had never really explored Gene Clark as a solo artist. Fortunately this was my first Gene Clark solo record purchase. Over half the songs are really great. I really don't think that he is like anyone else. Yes, you can hear the Dylan influence slightly but he has a unique voice and the knack for weird chord combinations that lend a mood to the music. I personally loved Gene's earliest stuff before he felt he had to be a \\"poet\\". Even on White Light it seems that he tries a little too hard at times and he misses the mark that could have been hit with simplicity. It is definitely worth the money to buy this CD.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Casino Royale is only the third Bond film I've ever seen. For many people, at least one of their favourite films will no doubt include a Bond film. I'd never really been bothered until recently, when I watched Living Daylights and Licence To Kill. Two older Bond films, with Mr Suave, Timothy Dalton. I must admit, when Daniel Craig was originally announced as the new Bond, I couldn't really see why, but out of others who were nominated to be Bond (Clive Owen for instance, no!), I could see he would be the best out of them. I'd only previously seen him in Layer Cake, which didn't impress me.<br /><br />Before seeing it, I was ordered to keep my back turned to the TV, and informed that I wasn't allowed to \\"moan, sigh, complain\\" and generally grumble about what I was about to watch. That normally means I'm in for a bad film.<br /><br />When the film started, it was in black and white. And then I spotted what looked suspiciously like Daniel Craig. OK, I knew what this was. (But I didn't complain.)<br /><br />And then the credits started, and they quite literally took my breath away. When by myself, I am notorious for fast forwarding through credits, unless they're short and sweet, or I'm looking for a name. But instead of the dancing girls, who have appeared in previous Bonds, this was stunning. Using the theme of cards (diamonds, hearts etc) it shows characters breaking into pieces upon being shot at with a diamond.<br /><br />Then the film started, and I was reminded of the finale of True Lies, where Eliza Dushku is on that crane thing, being chased by the bad guy, and waiting for Arnie to pop up. OK, I was reminded of it, but Casino Royale surpassed it every way imaginable. It's probably a thousand times higher, and involving (painfully) jumping from different sections of a construction site, it certainly starts the film with a bang and puts Daniel through his paces.<br /><br />There has been a lot of press & fuss about the scene where Daniel walks out of a beautiful ocean, in little blue trunks. I think I was the only woman in the world not to swoon at this shot. Everyone seems to rave about it, but you don't see anything! Stop letting your imaginations run wild, girls! For starters, you don't even see a full length shot. The scene I nearly swooned at (until I realised what was happening) was the naked torture scene. I didn't get what was happening, why exactly the seat of the chair was cut out, until I realised what exactly was getting whipped. Guys, you will cross your legs, and not let your girlfriend anywhere near the crown jewels after seeing this scene. Ouch. I think I went to cross my legs.<br /><br />What impressed me about Casino Royale, and ultimately, Daniel's performance, were the scenes opposite Eva Green. The scene in the shower, after she's witnessed him kill two men, where he sits beside her, made me go all gooey inside, and I actually felt a bit teary. It certainly showed a different side to Bond, a more romantic, softer side, which has only been briefly shown in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, when he gets married and loses his wife in a few hours. And then the stunning finale. WOW. Without ruining it, it shows the same side to Bond again, despite the fact he's been betrayed, and I nearly cried again, but I would have been embarrassed, so I managed to hold it back.<br /><br />Although I haven't seen many Bond films, this seems to surpass everything that was before it, including Pierce Brosnan (everyone will be saying \\"who?\\" after seeing Casino Royale). Daniel seems to be physically able to take part in the fights and he fills out a tux quite well. It helps he also quit smoking, and put on 20lbs of pure muscle to play Bond.<br /><br />I loved the poker scenes, but there's no way I could ever play it, I'd have on obvious tail! It's amazing how much money some players will throw at this game.<br /><br />My third Bond film - my favourite Bond movie. As soon as I got home, I raved about this film to my dad, to thepoint I probably revealed too much about the film when he hasn't seen it. I'm still not 100% about Daniel as Bond, with his ice blue eyes, and blonde hair (although it does look grey in some of the poker scenes!), but he gave it all and managed to come out and portray an excellent Bond, despite all the criticism in the press. All the reviews that just say bad things about Daniel not being a good Bond etc - ignore. He gives it his all as Bond, and showed me a different side to the action man. People are just missing Brosnan, or can't open their minds enough to see the director wanted a new, different Bond. They found him. For me, Daniel is the ultimate Bond. For some, they may argue Sean Connery or others are the definitive Bonds, but for me, Daniel played it magnificently, and will hopefully continue to play Bond. Introduce a new generation to Bond films. Like me.<br /><br />Now when's the next film?en it.

0374105235|5.0|A friend recommended this book to our book club so I ordered it without looking at the book online.  However, when it arrived I studied the cover and the title I felt I might be upset by the contents.   <br /> <br />This story IS riveting and I couldn't put it down. I was awake until 3 a.m. finishing every word on day 2 of my reading.  The fact that this is a true story and that it happened so recently is like being splashed with ice cold water, the water of reality. <br /> <br />The way the book was written makes it easier to read and to comprehend. I mean I kept waiting for the worst parts to come, but when they finally arrived, these impelling and extremely intense sections were split in a most tolerable way. <br /> <br />The story is riveting and not to be missed.  I agree with a review I read about western teens reading the book and seeing what life could be like for them, to help them appreciate with greater value the life they have in  Western countries. <br /> <br />Last September I was working in Sri Lanka, and spent 3 of my 5 weeks in the Eastern Province, where the Tsunami had hit and a civil war was happening all around me. I learned about the child soldiers forced to served with the LTTE. Now I must find out if they are living the same life as Ismael and his friends. <br /> <br />WARNING:  There are some very good reviews on this list, but a some of them tell you the whole story.  I'm glad I'm only seeing them now as I would not have wanted to know so many details prior to reading the book. <br /> <br />Truly not to be missed!!
B000MRAAJM|2.0|I was eagerly anticipating the release of this series and it is quite stunning to watch some scenes, however the quality is not up to my expectations. Honestly, Fantastic Four was a better transfer... Many scenes are extraordinarily grainy, e.g. Freshwater (Disc 1, Title 4, Chapter 1, 1:30-1:45)  <br /> <br />Second, it would be nice to have the option of selecting alternate narrations... the Attenborough narration is a little monotone and he sounds out of breath most of the time... apologies to any Attenborough fans. <br /> <br />Missing special features on Blu-Ray compared to DVD... come-on... what kind of half-baked nonsense is this? You're supposed to sell us on the Blu-Ray capabilities not give us LESS (I know we get more pixels... I'm not talking pixels... I'm talking minutes of video content). <br /> <br />My setup: PS3 HDMI to Samsung 40\\" LCD 1080i
B00005JPLU|5.0|<br />A spectacular stylized action movie of real beauty. The fight scenes are excellently choreographed and engages the viewers senses. The critics have tended to concentrate on the inessentials missing the finer points of the film which include an interesting story line interspersed with mounds and mounds of dead bodies and a lot of gushing blood. A real treat for the action buff and connoisseur of violence on the big screen. The film even manages to look good on DVD. You really can't ask for more.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I tried to stay off the Norah Jones bandwagon, honest I did.<br /><br />Down in Costa Rica, trying to live a humble honest-man's life, feeling deeply for the Latin musicians who were so very, very good but never had a chance to be heard by the big-spending millions because they were three yards off the marketing juggernaut's path ...<br /><br />Norah, I says to myself, Norah doesn't need one more gringo buyin' her CDs, one more nameless addition to the anonymous pile of her fans.<br /><br />Just about then the vague fear of losing out on something genuinely big set in. I responded prudently and did the only thing a 'spectable man could do: I borrowed a friend's copy of COME AWAY WITH ME and played it while the family slept in the Toyota Landcruiser on the way back from a long, lovely weekend in Savegre, where trout streams pound down out of the cloud-forested mountains, dogs run to their dog hearts' delight, and stressed out educators stare out at the blue sky and green hills and wonder about things.<br /><br />Norah didn't click with me on that low-volume car ride and I almost sensed a quick triumph. But she was just gettin' started.<br /><br />Now, five years and countless listenings later, I come again under the spell of this effortlessly laid-back singer's song. It is so very, very sweet.<br /><br />The disk opens with Norah's relentlessly enigmatic 'Don't Know Why',  a look-back to what might have been. This notion falls smack dab in the center of Blues Cosmology, but somehow rarely gets sung quite so persuasively. 'I left you by the house of fun, I don't know why I didn't come', she explains. The 'what if' question will endure a lifetime:<br /><br />'Out across the endless sea<br />I would die in ecstasy<br />But I'll be a bag of bones<br />Driving down the road alone<br /><br />My heart is drenched in wine<br />But you'll be on my mind<br />Forever.'<br /><br />Norah didn't write these words. Her task is simply to turn them into poignant sound that catches a snag on the heart's doorknob and hangs there as long as memory lingers.<br /><br />Yet she is no one-note crooner. From the &uuml;ber-sultry 'Turn Me On', to the tango-esque (yes, indeed) 'I've Got to See You Again', Norah simply convinces her listener that she's articulating the sentiment for the very first time.<br /><br />'Lines on your face don't bother me<br />Down in my chair where you dance over me<br />I can't help myself<br />I've got to see you again<br /><br />Late in the night when I'm all alone<br />And I look at the clock and I know you're not home<br />I can't help myself<br />I've got to see you again<br />I could almost go there<br />Just to watch you be seen<br />I could almost go there<br />Just to live in a dream'<br /><br />Come to think of it, the doorknob has snagged itself more than one memory, this time of a weathered face the seeing of which marked a point of no turning back. Norah looks too young to know about such moments, but truth is in the telling.

1569242739|5.0|I'm only a vegetarian myself but I bought this book because it seemed to have much more adventurous cupcake flavors than other books. I recently made the pumpkin chocolate chip cupcakes, they were fairly easy to make and everyone loved them. I've done vegan baking before and things have turned out dense and dry, the recipe I made from here was light, moist and just delicious. I've already had 2 people ask for the recipe and now I know what I'll be getting people as a gift in the future, this book! Good stuff!

0312995423|2.0|I read some of the other reviews of this book and decided to try it anyway. What a mistake! <br /> <br />If you enjoy technology and work with computers you probably won't like this book. It is nowhere near the caliber of Deception Point and the technology is either dated or just plain wrong. <br /> <br />At almost every turn, it is clear that Dan Brown does not understand technology behind cell phones, computer hardware, security, and cryptology. The entire basis for the book is flawed: An \\"unbreakable\\" encryption algorithm using a 64 bit key represented by 64 characters (Dan doesn't understand the difference between bits and characters) that cannot be broken by a brute force attack - such as trying each possible key. Cell phone calls are traced through \\"booster stations\\", E-mails that \\"call home\\" after passing through servers and that can be remotely controlled as they are being delivered. <br /> <br />A lot of the action takes place in the NSA's most secure facility. Too bad it's so insecure during over the weekend. It's just not believable. <br /> <br />A minor distraction is that many of the companies that DB mentions are now out of business (remember Prodigy and Compuserv). Such is \\"Internet time\\". (The book was written in 1997.) <br /> <br />The book reminds me of poorly done TV action shows where one improbable event is followed by a never-ending stream of other improbable events. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a good action/thriller and you have not read Deception Point, try that instead. <br /> <br />If you are unfamiliar with the technology that powers the Internet, you may enjoy Digital Fortress (hence the rating of '2' rather than '1'.)

0451197968|4.0|For those who have only seen the movie, this book will not be what you expect.  It seems that the producers of the film only wanted the bare concept about a life and death TV game show and then made up their own story from there.  This Ben Richards is a volunteer who wants to earn enough money to pay for his daughter to get medical care.  He is a fairly bitter man in a bleak world and the overall tone of the novel is largely pessimistic.   <br /> <br />Regardless of the dark tone, this is still an entertaining book.  Richards is not the most likable character, but the network executives and hunters are so odious that you can't help but root for the underdog.  The story moves along fairly briskly and there is enough character development to make you care what happens to Ben and his helpers.  This may not be one of King's best novels, but it makes for an entertaining read and I would recommend it on that level. <br /> <br />One word of warning, however.  King has added an introduction in which he gives away the ending to the book.  Why an experienced writer has done something so foolish is beyond me but the knowledge badly damaged my ability to read and enjoy the book.  If you have not read Running Man before, I highly encourage you to skip the introduction until after you have read the story.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I've never been the biggest Bond fan.  The movies had become more and more preposterous over the years, and the villains had lost their teeth.  And, frankly, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan never measured up for me.  This is not intended to be yet another \\"Connery is the only real Bond\\" arguments, because that makes it sound like he's the only one who CAN fill the role.  That's not true.  But what Bond needs, and that only Connery has had, is an edge.  You should believe that he really would kill you without batting an eyelash.  Especially in the earliest few films, Connery exuded that. <br /> <br />And now, finally, another Bond exudes it as well.  Simply put, from the opening scene, you completely believe Daniel Craig's Bond would, and COULD, kill you.  I never thought that about Roger Moore or especially Brosnan. <br /> <br />The action pieces are great and blessedly understated.  The drama feels much more believable than any of the recent episodes.  The Aston Martin is stunning (what Aston Martin isn't), as is Eva Green as the latest Bond Girl. <br /> <br />Great movie.  Can't wait to see the next Daniel Craig installment.

039472903X|5.0|If you wanted to become a heart surgeon and could learn from Dr. DeBakke, you would certainly do it. If your goal was to climb Mt. Everest and Sir Edmund Hillary wanted to offer up advice, you'd certainly take it. And if it is your aspiration to work in marketing, reading the works of David Ogilvy is almost a prerequisite. Though he came along much later than the \\"pioneers\\" of advertising, there is no debate that Ogilvy revolutionized marketing.<br /><br />The fascinating thing for me, as I read OGILVY ON ADVERTISING, was not Ogilvy's brilliance, but rather his common sense approach to advertising. Since people buy magazines for the articles, not for the ads, it only makes sense to make your ads LOOK like an article. And if you're offering a savings, it only makes sense to instruct the reader on how to determine how much they will save with your product.<br /><br />The book is also laden with time-tested ads that work, and some that clearly don't. This is like a 200 page swipe file of some of the greatest ads ever. If marketing or copywriting is calling your name, read this book.

0385335997|3.0|More than twenty years has passed since time-travelling nurse Claire Randall Fraser was forced to flee her 17th century husband, Jamie, after the disastrous battle of Culloden destroyed the Scots.  In the 20th century, Claire has built a good life, reluctantly remaining wife to Frank Randall to raise Brianna, Jamie's daughter.  Claire has become a respected physician in Boston.  But now that Brianna is a young woman and Frank has died, Claire faces a choice:  should she return to 17th century Scotland to try to find Jamie and build a life with him or remain in the 20th century with her now grown daughter?  The call of true love is too strong and Claire embarks on another journey back in time to rejoin the only man she can ever love.  But  in the two decades since they last met, Jamie has encountered hardships and challenges that have changed him.  Hunted by the English as a traitor, forced to live for 7 years in a cave, Jamie has spent time in prison, has lived as a menial servant and has fathered a son by an imperious, spoiled rich girl who refused to take no for an answer.  Strangers again, Claire and Jamie must discover if the love they enjoyed twenty years before is enough to sustain them now.  Gabaldon has written a magnificent continuation of the story of Claire and Jamie.  She explores the logical questions of survival, loyalty and love.  As usual, Gabaldon relies a little too heavily on romance devices that strain belief, but in the end, the reader enjoys the ride so much, she doesn't mind the manipulation.

Even though \\"Contact\\" is Sagan's only novel, it's a very good one, with a firm basis in real-world science. Adapted to the screen, it loses a lot, but the story is compelling, and the cast does a very good job of making it work. The special effects are impressive, too. One day, we may actually receive an interstellar welcome. The scenario presented in \\"Contact\\" may not be all that far off the mark as to how and what that message may be and how we'll work on reading it.

I could not for the life of me understand why anyone would tell me this was a book to read. <br /> <br />Second time was as a 3rd year.  I still thought it was pretty bad but perhaps had some redeeming moments and was worth reading. <br /> <br />Third time was the middle of internship - before the kinder gentler 80h work week limits - on my one vacation of the year.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|\\"Lebowski\\" is a modern classic. Laid back and nuanced, it may not fit everyone's sense of humor, but I think it's the best comedy of the past decade. Jeff Bridges is the ultimate slacker, John Goodman is his overly serious pal, and Steve Buscemi is their mousey sidekick. A parade of interesting and hilarious characters pass through the story, each adding their own flavor to the mix of irony, satire, and misidentification. I don't even like bowling, but I loved \\"Lebowski.\\"
B0006AOLC2|1.0|Perusal of this vile classic allows one to clear up many misconceptions about Nazism. For instance, we sometimes hear that the German people came to support Hitler without ever understanding his positions. MEIN KAMPF lays this notion soundly to rest!<br /><br />Some commentators doubt if National Socialism had actually been a form of socialism. It is therefore instructive that Hitler supported trade unions (pp. 874-876), and that the annotators of MEIN KAMPF recognized the fact that the Nazi economy had been a Planswirtschaft (planned economy; p. 880).<br /><br />Traditional Christian theology, about Jews and deicide, is often blamed for the Holocaust. We learn instead that Hitler's pathological hatred of Jews had NOTHING to do with Christian theology. In fact, the only time that Hitler even touched on this issue was when he asserted that Jews crucified Christ for having opposed their commercialization of the Temple (p. 423). Indeed, Hitler saw Jews as a parasitic element that takes the hard-earned wealth of others. They did this through such things as becoming intermediaries in trade, and through usury (pp. 419-on). When the masses rebel against this exploitation (as through pogroms), the Jews ingratiate themselves to the rulers for protection. No matter how many times they are persecuted, Jews will always return to their ingrained exploitative ways (p. 427). Furthermore, Jews will, according to Hitler, resort to all forms of mendacity and slander in order to protect their privileged, exploitative positions. Such things as Jewish assimilation, philanthropy, and conversions to Christianity are nothing but disguises to further Jewish ends. Hitler was unfazed by the fact that the PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION were inauthentic. To him, the Jewish reaction against this publication was itself proof of its authenticity (p. 424). Finally, whether themselves authentic or not, the PROTOCOLS were supposed to constitute a valid appraisal of Jewish attitudes and goals.<br /><br />Hitler unambiguously believed that only Germanic peoples invent things (pp. 397-398). The creativity of a society is directly proportional to the Germanic content of its stock and inversely proportional to the degree of \\"bastardization\\" with inferior races. The Fuhrer made countless racist statements against Slavs. Hitler repeatedly lamented the fact that the admixture of Jews and Slavs had polluted the Germanic element of his native Austria (e. g., pp. 138-140). The Fuhrer also contended that Slavs have no capability of self-government--their rulers must all be of Germanic origin (p. 951). Hitler was no white supremacist; he was a German supremacist par excellence!<br /><br />Proponents of Holocaust uniqueness sometimes claim that, whereas there was nothing that Jews could do to change their standing in the eyes of the Nazis, Poles could redeem themselves by undergoing Germanization. This is fallacious. Hitler said, \\"Here too one believed that one could bring about a Germanization of the Polish element by a purely linguistic integration into the German nationality. Here too the result would have been an unfortunate one: people of an alien race, expressing its alien thoughts in the German language, compromising the height and the dignity of our own nationality by its own inferiority.\\" (p. 590). (During the later German occupation of Poland, the \\"Germanization\\" of selected Poles was actually a re-Germanization of ethnic Germans who had previously become Polonized.)<br /><br />We sometimes hear the claim that the German people voted for Hitler, in free elections, without realizing the fact that he would start a major war. Perhaps, some say, Hitler would be, at worst, content with a little war to rectify the \\"injustices\\" of Versailles. In actuality, there is much more to MEIN KAMPF than the customary German self-pity regarding WWI and Versailles. Clear proof that the Fuhrer had long planned a war of massive conquest and extermination, against the Slavic peoples, is provided by his following statements regarding lebensraum: \\"Neither eastern nor western orientation should be the future goal of our foreign policy, but an eastern policy signifying the acquisition of the necessary soil for our German people.\\" (pp. 965-966). (Later, the Nazis spoke of \\"resettlement\\" of Jews and Slavs. In time, \\"resettlement\\" evolved into a euphemism for extermination.)Slavic peoples, is provided by his following statements regarding lebensraum: \\"Neither eastern nor western orientation should be the future goal of our foreign policy, but an eastern policy signifying the acquisition of the necessary soil for our German people.\\" (pp. 965-966).

078401213X|4.0|...then this is one you'll definitely want to see. It's an odd premise. A math whiz (Max) has converted his New york apartment into some sort of Rube Goldberg supercomputer as he finesses his ulimate equation: an algorithm that can accurately predict the outcome of seemingly random input. Despite his secretive, paranoid ways, word leaks out that he's on to something big.  A Wall Street brokerage wants to secure the formula from him to get a jump on the stock market. A Jewish Kabbala cult pursues him in order to learn the true name of God. Both groups will go to extremes to get it from him. Max seeks advice from his mentor, Professor Robeson, who advises him to drop it altogehter and that the quest will drive him insane, and it nearly does. But it turns out that Robeson is himself working along similar lines, and he pays the price.<br /><br />This is obviously a low-budget film, shot entirely in black and white. But the tension is real and the character development is high-grade. A very different and very good thriller.

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Filmed in some of the most beautiful and picturesque places in Europe, \\"The Illusionist\\" is a cross between magic and love.<br /><br />Edward Norton is a charismatic and gifted magician, Eisenhiem, while is love interest, Jessica Biel, Dutchess Sophie van Teschen, is an aristocrat with whom he is not supposed to interact.<br /><br />This film is brilliantly dark at parts, keeping just enough mystery to entice the viewer, but revealing tidbits that encourage the magic, the mystery.  Eisenhiem (Norton), has learned so much that he can trick and convince even the harshest critics and cynics, going so far as to upstage a crown prince, Leopold, the man in line for the crown, and the man vying for Biel's hand in marriage.  Eisenhiem seems to be one step ahead at all times, ready for the inquisitive and the doubters, even the Inspector General, the man who is supposed to know all secrets of the area.<br /><br />What eventually happens is that the Prince orders the Inspector General, Uhl, to shut down Eisenhiem's show, because the Prince doesn't like the competition.  While doing so, however, he pushes the love-triangle ahead, causing a death, some unbelievable magic (conjuring of spirits) that sways the masses, and a devious, albeit somewhat forseeable twist, that is sure to entertain.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Released on VHS tape in the middle of the Eighties, this film is now available on DVD (Region 1 code). It is the (light) story of a trip through the blues and its roots. A young white guitar player (Ralph Macchio) meets in a hospital an old black bluesman (Joe Seneca) and they decide to leave together for the Delta, looking for the crossroads where the bluesman sold his soul to the Devil when he was young and there try to break such contract. During the journey, they establish a master/pupil relationship (Ralph Macchio seems to be specialized in such roles: do you remember Karate Kid?) and go through some hardships till they reach the crossroads and meet the Devil. This meeting leads the two friends to the final challenge: if the young guitarist beats Devil's pupil (Steve Vai) in a blues competition, the old bluesman's soul will be saved. This is the highlight of the film, where the two competitors challenge each other playing blues standards in their different ways: by one hand Steve Vai (in a very good form) plays his pieces in an aggressive \\"hard-rock\\" style, while, on the other hand, the boy (but with Ray Cooder's hands! Look at the end titles to discover the real player...) plays his guitar in a slide traditional way, with a bottleneck. This is the story. As for the rest, the film is a just a comedy, with a mix of flavors, lightly served: Robert Johnson's life, Faust, Karate Kid, and - fortunately - some good music, performed in the topical parts of the show (apart from the final duel, there are some nice performances in two-three moments of the film). So, do not surprise if this film will not win any Oscar, but the \\"crunch\\" sound of Macchio-Cooder's Telecaster, played with an old valve guitar amp, still sounds very nice to electric blues listeners.  <br />P.S.: the soundtrack is available on CD but WITHOUT the songs of the final challenge. <br />Riccardo Frau <br />Italy <br />
B00005JPPI|4.0|Blessed with a smart script, stylish direction and first-rate performances by Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling, \\"Fracture\\" emerges as more than just the \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" knock-off it would appear to be on the surface.<br /><br />In a role reminiscent of a somewhat toned-down (i.e. non-cannibalistic) Hannibal Lecter, Hopkins plays Ted Crawford, a wealthy L.A. businessman who shoots his wife when he discovers she's having an affair with a professional hostage negotiator.  Crawford readily admits to the crime, giving the police a signed confession and insisting on defending himself in court.  Gosling is Willy Beachum, a cocky, up-and-coming public prosecutor who takes the case believing it will be one last slam-dunk victory for him before he moves on to bigger and better things at a prestigious private law firm downtown.  Beachum gets more than he bargained for, however, when the creepy and unnerving Crawford begins to play the legal system for all it's worth, tweaking the hotshot lawyer by outthinking him and continually knocking him off his game.<br /><br />In less capable hands, \\"Fracture\\" could easily have been a standard-issue, twist-and-turn courtroom drama, but thanks to the talents involved, it transcends the limitations of its genre.  Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers have written a screenplay filled with witty, crackling dialogue and sharply observed insights into the psyches of its two principal characters.  Hopkins and Gosling play the cat-and-mouse game with conviction and gusto, while director Gregory Hoblit and cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau use a smoothly gliding camera and a barely perceptible visual distortion at the edges of the picture to highlight the \\"fractured\\" nature of the piece.  Moreover, the film has a nice L.A. feel to it, as it takes us to various interesting sites around town, including the ultra-modern, near-surrealistic Disney Concert Hall located in the heart of the city.<br /><br />There is strong supporting work by David Straitharn (\\"Good Night, and Good Luck\\"), Billy Burke, Rosamund Pike and Fiona Shaw (\\"Mountains of the Moon\\"), among others, but it is Hopkins and Gosling, locked in a life-or-death battle of acumen and wits, who make \\"Fracture\\" a perpetually compelling and watchable courtroom thriller.Good Luck\\"), Billy Burke, Rosamund Pike and Fiona Shaw (\\"Mountains of the Moon\\"), among others, but it is Hopkins and Gosling, locked in a life-or-death battle of acumen and wits, who make \\"Fracture\\" a perpetually compelling and watchable courtroom thriller.

B000PUAHOY|2.0|I doze off for all of three seconds watching David Lynch's new film, INLAND EMPIRE, and it must have been a crucial three seconds, for when I looked back at the screen, I was as lost as a character out of Lynch's amnesiac LOST HIGHWAY. We can go on about the freedom an artist possesses to express himself, (Lynch worked without any studio interference on INLAND), and how an empty cinematic plate is to the film director what an empty canvas is to an artist, but when all is said and done, boring is boring is boring, and boy oh boy, this is boring. I don't need a linear plotline to keep me attentive to a Lynch film, the music, sound, and images can speak to me on a level more rewarding than a story line, but just how many times were we to watch Laura Dern's (producer and star), character, walk down a dark Lynchian hall way, and slowly open a secret door to reveal another secret hallway and another secret door, and another, and another, ... in the meantime we get every Lynch trick and treat known to film, (men talking in silly voices, cigarettes burning holes in the sky, neighbors with clairvoyant messages, etc.), losing impact like an unfinished highway, without however, a silent dwarf, whose appearence may have signaled the close of this murky film, and with, a TV studio sitcom of two-footed, human-like, living room rabbits, which become a welcome relief of familiarity and order, when interrupting Dern's endless bewildered quest.<br /><br />The way I see it, in Lynch's vision of INLAND EMPIRE, there is an imperfect parallel universe fighting each other for survival, and such conflict is the cause of all violence in the world. It's as good an idea as the snake tempting Eve with the apple. So we have Alice, (Dern), not so much falling down a rabbit hole, as being dragged through one, and then things get peculiar and peculier. The film often drifts towards a group of T & A gifted women, (picture a poverty stricken Spice Girls), who may be the victims of assault and murder, and may be consoling Dern's character in an afterlife, or a parallel universe, or posssibly they're really there in Dern's apartment, lying around like a Penthouse photo shoot and dancing to Little Eva's \\"Locomotion\\". Or maybe they're just a delusion. Or maybe they're simply the biggest T's and the best A's ever seen in a Lynch film.<br /><br />Cameos galore here; Bill H. Macy, Diane Ladd, (Laura Dern's mom), Nastassja Kinski; you just want to stop one of them and say, do something before you leave! Don't leave me alone with Laura! I can't bear another handsome close-up and dreary speech! What about those rabbits? Why not bring The Spice Girls into the rabbit sitcom? That might work. Hugh Hefner could enter and say, \\"It's just a rabbit, dear.\\"<br /><br />I'm out the door of the theatre and there's a sidewalk sign from the club next door reading, HALF-PRICE COCKTAILS WITH MOVIE TICKET STUB. I am SO there, and in pure Lynchian fashion, me and the dwarf enter our own parallel universe.ay be consoling Dern's character in an afterlife, or a parallel universe, or posssibly they're really there in Dern's apartment, lying around like a Penthouse photo shoot and dancing to Little Eva's \\"Locomotion\\".

0783117523|4.0|I watched this movie because my daughter was watching it. What a sad story. I think all young girls at one time or another wish they could be in a magazine. Most forget about it as they pursue real careers that would satisfy them. There were two lines in the movie that really struck me,one from the actor that played the famed photographer Frances Scuvullo,who states \\"We use them up and throw them away\\"!And one from the main character Gia(Angelina Jolie) I go on go sees, I go,I go. but they don't see me aagh piece of meat. That was how she felt like a \\"thing\\".Gia should have had a parent with her. She was 17 years old when she entered the business. From the movie part Gia seemed to want her mother to stay with her and she couldn't or wouldn't, you don't really know. Also where were her friends when she began this spiral downward? Sad story about to much, too fast and no guidance.They may have called Cindy Crawford \\"Baby Gia\\" in the beginning, but had Gia the fortitude and knowledge that Cindy possessed (and Cindy Crawford was 20, still not as young as Gia was), but still young she might have been alright. Cindy Crawford has stated in numerous interviews that she is Cindy, \\"Cindy Crawford is the \\"thing\\", the product. She knew this and worked it to her advantage.She recalls one event where a famous actor (she never states who ,darn)saw her on a magazine had his agent get her number for a date and when he went to pick her  up he was disappointed because she was just Cindy.What a horses behind this guy must have been LOL. Gia was used,she used,manipulated and manipulating,she needed real professional help, but all she got in the end was a far to early grave.
B000089CJI|4.0|This is NOT something I expected to enjoy as much as I did. I'm giving it 4 stars for the sake of tilting rating inflation that is nearly universal on Amazon. I like it better than Ben's \\"Death Cab...\\" work but I must say I'm not very familiar with the whole discography as I tend to be leaning toward more \\"challenging\\" music these days.  I would lump this into the \\"organic electronica\\" category... leaning slightly toward \\"baroque pop\\".  This type of music can be hard to pin down. Layers of sound and beats are incorporated in such a way that it does not come off as jarring but soothing. Scratchy analog noise juxtapose crystal clear 80's style syncs.  Seemingly random sounds, electronic \\"sparkle\\", brass, base, and ambient noise are reminiscent of \\"Kid A\\" yet more optimistic rather than dark or indifferent.  (oddly or coincidentally they both have a song called \\"national anthem\\")  Low-fi string samples and time changes lead to climactic emotional moments perhaps most notable on \\"Brand New Colony.\\"  <br /> <br />Ben's lyrics have always fit the scope of his work but seem overly trite on this album.  This project is however less about the lyrics and there are plenty of stellar albums that are none the less week in this regard... \\"Neon Bible\\" immediately comes to mind. Alas, an album is much greater than the sum of it's parts.  It's difficult to say weather or not this body of work is truly original or just a rehash of something that came before.  None the less an album need not be groundbreaking in order to be imeniently enjoyable.  I'm growing tired of reviewers suggesting that another artist did it \\"better\\" in a past album.  While it may or may not be true it does not invalidate a new piece of work nor does it undermine a past one.  In this day there really are no new genres.   <br /> <br />Unlike most reviewers here I will say that not everyone will love of even like this album at all.  It's not mainstream; indeed not everyone thinks that \\"Funeral\\" is best thing in the world either. Everything is subjective. That being said fans of \\"Radiohead\\", \\"Arcade Fire\\", \\"Sufjan Stevens\\", \\"Idiot Pilot\\", later \\"Of Montreal\\", and many other other experimental electronica fusion or \\"new wave\\" albums may very well find a place for this in their collection.  At least give it a listen and leave your bias at the door.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Rush return with a great new album - (my local record store put it out last Friday!). Their best effort since Counterparts, great balance between heavy and light, acoustic and electric. Crisp clear balanced production.  On first listen the instrumental Hope by Lerxst seems out of place, but after listening to the album for a while, it earns it's place, especially considering the three heavier pieces that follow it. <br />When I reach the end of the album I await the first track with great anticipation, I will remember the day I bought this for a long, long time. <br />So will you.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I'm not a huge AFI fan. My daughter is. I'm not the kind of mom who listens to everything before her child, I let her decide what she likes for herself. My tastes in music tend to be very ecclectic, and while I had my reservations about this group, I listened to their music. I don't like it all, probably never will like it all, but there are enough songs on here that the disc is worth buying. We each have one now. I can't really compare them to other groups, because they really do have their own sound. Their previous CD's tend to be more on the order of 'punk' and some of their songs have a good deal of screaming, but you'll find treasures on those, like Silver & Cold, and This Time Imperfect. Davey Havok's tonal range is really nice, from screaming to soft and smooth in nothing flat. December Underground is worth the $15.00 you'll spend. It's one of the few CD's I can listen to completely rather than just one song here, one song there.
B00000I8UD|5.0|I once read a description of David Sylvian which suggested that he is a singer of gloomy and depressing songs. I had to laugh. Perhaps, superficially, this is true. It is always easier to sound \\"clever\\" when one says something sad or depressing. Writing an intelligent, hopeful, helpful and happy song is one of the hardest things to do.<br /><br />I would prefer to say that David Sylvian deals with deeper feelings and impressions. He does this with great style, power, beauty, commitment and, dare I say it, intelligence. I have always admired what he has accomplished, except his first two Japan albums, which, I am sure, Mr. Sylvian disowns, himself. I would have to say that David Sylvian and John Foxx are my two favourite modern songwriters - the \\"Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert\\" of the late TwenCen.<br /><br />\\"Dead Bees On A Cake\\" is a remarkable album. It features very interesting and colourful (if that is the word) instrumental frames for the voice of Mr. Sylvian. The music touches on various styles (like Jazz and Blues, for instance), too, but it doesn't follow the rules of any of these styles. This is music where the sound of the instruments is important and the voice and instruments work together to produce musical \\"paintings\\".<br /><br />Mr. Sylvian is in good voice and his smooth and languid baritone voice is as expressive as ever.<br /><br />Listen to \\"I Surrender\\" and you will do, possibly, two things - weep and .... want hear more.<br /><br />This is an album very close to my heart.
B00003CXTG|2.0|I honestly did try to watch this movie at one point and just couldn't. It seemed like it dragged on forever and ever. I don't do the long synopsis of movies but I will say this. The story was supposed to revolve around these characters during the attack on Pearl Harbor. That much they got. But I didn't care about the characters, the development really stunk. I found myself rooting for the Japanese pilots, a la MST3K. Drivel doesn't even begin to cover it. The costuming was done well, and the props in the sets well selected, but that's about the only good thing I can say for this movie. Watch it once. This is a movie you'll either love or hate.

0307346609|5.0|This book is a series of interviews from various survivors of the Zombie War that takes place in the future (and not too far, it seems). It goes from Patient Zero in China through how people fight to survive, then to fight back and finally, the clean up.<br /><br />I hate zombie movies. I don't even like parodies of them, which makes me really surprised I enjoyed this book so much. I think it's the notable lack of zombies (they were shoved into the background). I don't know a lot about politics or economics, and I'm sure someone more learned in those areas might have a problem with what Brooks did with global politics and economics, but it worked for me. I have a feeling Brooks had a fun time with the breaking down of various countries and organizations. People who follow politics will probably get more out of the clever things slipped in. Or at least, be more annoyed by them.<br /><br />I do think it's easy to make this book political commentary, but I also think it depends on what the reader brings to the table. I missed a lot of the digs at the left and right because I don't pay attention to some of these people. Caricatures are what they are. People will exploit them, but I don't think it has to ruin the book, unless someone lets it. It was the stories of the people that drew me, in the end. I think the most horrific interviews were the ones where there are holes or silence. The interview about Korea was an example of this.<br /><br />The relation between the zombie virus and the avian flu is pretty pronounced, and I think my experience of the book was influenced by a result of listening to friends talk about History of Medicine lectures with me over the subject. I am fearful of outbreaks.<br /><br />This isn't a novel in the standard sense, but it doesn't detract. Actually, it reminded me a lot of The Laramie Project, how through interviews you piece together a horrific event and the aftermath of it. It's a very effective method of storytelling, although I also think that it would be even more effective in another medium (like a movie). But even as a novel, I enjoyed it very much.h I also think that it would be even more effective in another medium (like a movie). But even as a novel, I enjoyed it very much.
0743496728|5.0|To anyone who has a child (or a young adult) at school, this is a terrifying book. It details a murderous assault on a high school that results in ten deaths and many more injured. The perpetrator is a 17 year old \\"outcast\\" student, who has endured years of bullying at the hands of the \\"popular\\" crowd. Of course, this book is more than just that bare outline I've given: it delves into the lives of the shooter, one of his only friends and her mother, and a police detective investigating the crime. The writing ability of this author is such that,even as you shrink in horror from his actions, you have some sympathy for the young man involved. The book moves along at a breathtaking pace, and at the end the reader is confronted with not one, but two shocks. With so many schools seemingly under attack these days, this book should be required reading for everyone.
0375831002|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend, a WWII geek, who spoke so highly of it I had to read it. This book is narrated by Death. Death tells the story of Liesel Meminger, The Book Thief, a German girl living in [...] Germany, in Molching. He outlines the events of Liesel's life, her career as a book thief, and takes us along on her journey with words.<br /><br />I worried initially that this would be like other WWII fiction I had read, but it turned out to be so different. It's rare I don't know what what to say about a book I've read, but this book does that. I don't think I've been so moved by a book in a long time. I was at first startled because I'm not the biggest fan of first person, but once into the story I didn't notice it at all. Perhaps because the narrator is Death.<br /><br />The storytelling is beautiful. I don't know how else to describe it. In one of my university classes, there was a concept a professor mentioned once--changing the meaning of a word, using a word differently, trusting the reader to understand. It's hard to do. In The Book Thief, this is done so well as to make me wide-eyed at phrases made new.<br /><br />But then again; it's Death. What's language to him, if humans are going to keep changing it each generation?<br /><br />I loved this book. I think the horror of it for me was summed up in one sentence, when Death says about 1942: \\"It was a year for the ages, like 79, like 1346, to name just a few. Forget the scythe, Goddamn it, I needed a broom or a mop. And I needed a vacation.\\"<br /><br />I really, honestly, loved this novel and have no complaints whatsoever. The author did a tremendous job in investing me in the world and the characters, and what was made was marvelous, horrifying and gorgeous all at the same time.
0553381407|4.0|It is rare that any of us grow up in \\"perfectly-parented\\" households; after all we're imperfect humans.  Some of us have had really difficult, complex upbringings.  Yet, we can move on and make the best of our lives with the help of information offered in this book.  It opened a new vista for me,  and parents should find it thought-provoking for their own relationships, especially in regard to both their parents and their children.      It was a great help to recognize the psychological types in my parents.  For a couple of years in my adulthood my mother and I even \\"divorced\\" each other.  Although we were not able to resolve all our issues before her death, we were finally able to function on relatively friendly terms in the last years of her life.    Although individual situations often warrant consulting a professional counselor, this book is an invaluable tool for identifying and recognizing the problematic traits, reasons for the behaviors, and ways to move beyond the differences, so you don't wallow in the blame-game.  Depending on one's spiritual inclination, blame cannot be laid entirely on the parent.  There may be karmic dynamics that call for healing.    E. A. Davis, author, Waiting for Wings: Accompanying a Parent to the Edge of Life
B000002LR3|1.0|my own fault for not researching it further, or at least listening to the tracks first. always wanted to check this band out, with a great name like that how bad could they be? sorry i asked. what a drippy, instantly-forgettable pile of mumbly drivel. psychedelic? omg hardly, unless you can trip on prozac and think jam bands are the coolest thing ever.

B000NA28I4|1.0|I have to be honest I've not read the book but there was a lot of hype about the film and so one evening when I was bored I decided to rent it out on dvd and see if the hype was justified. What a mistake that was! <br /> <br />The film is a poor imitation of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Robert Carlyle's character looks strangely like Worm Tongue (L.O.T.R)and behaves like a Saruman type figure commanding creatures that appear to be a cross between dark riders and uraki. Jeremy Irons plays a Borromir type character who happens to die heroically saving the main character Eragon from certain death. Ring any bells?  <br /> <br />The special effects used in the film are quite good but some aspects are just not convincing. For example, the names used for the characters Galbatorix and Saphira sound like names from the Doctor Who series of the 70's. Then they sounded ok but in 2006/7 they just sound cheesy. And when I heard the voice of the dragon that was a very well spoken, female, of the English grammar school type it just did not fit. Dragons (if they even speak at all) are supposed to have 'booming' earth shaking,type voices. They breathe fire for god's sake! The last time I breathed fire was after a heavy night in the pub and the following day I know I definitely did not sound like Rachel Weisz! <br /> <br />Overall a very disappointing film that really doesn't add anything new to the genre. Don't spend your money on this. Instead save your money and purchase the L.O.T.R trilogy (extended versions)or if you have it already just save your money.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|He finally did it! Neil Young has recorded another masterpiece to stand alongside his 1972 album, Harvest. Full of honest emotion, beauty and variety, the colorful Prairie Wind (2005) is an ambitious work of art that reflects the life of Neil Young at 60. During the recording of Prairie Wind, Young's famous Canadian sportswriter dad passed away, and Neil himself had brain surgery to repair a life threatening aneurysm. Thoughts of his own mortality show up in various songs on the album, such as This Old Guitar, an acoustic guitar duet with Emmylou Harris.<br /><br />This old guitar ain't mine to keep,<br />It's mine to play for a while,<br />This old guitar ain't mine to keep,<br />It's only mine for a while.<br /><br />The song is performed on Hank Williams' old Martin guitar, and the singer realizes his guitar will outlive him, just as it has outlived it's other famous owner. Here For You is a father's touching letter to a daughter who has just left the nest, and many fathers of daughters will recognize themselves in this song even if their daughters are still at home. The Painter is a song that would have fit well on Harvest or Harvest Moon, and offers this advice:<br /><br />If you follow every dream<br />You might get lost<br /><br />No Wonder includes some solid acoustic guitar work from Young, and while an electric slide guitar wails, Neil sings of an \\"old church on the hill\\", a \\"fallen soldier bell\\", and a senator that \\"took his money just like all the rest\\".<br /><br />Musically, the album features acoustic guitars, harmonica, pedal steel guitar, fiddle, electric guitars, a horn section, a church choir, piano, dobro, and an orchestra.<br /><br />He Was The King is a fun, rollicking, half satire, half tribute to Elvis, and the last song adresses a subject Young has been reticent about most of his career, his faith. In the hymn When God Made Me, Young sings about the world's and his own relationship with God.<br /><br />Did He give us the gift of love,<br />To say who we could choose,<br />When God made me<br />When God made me.<br /><br />Prairie Wind satisfies at every level. Musically, lyrically, emotionally. The prevailing theme is what Neil Young has on his mind at 60 years old, and as it turns out, these are the same things that most of of us have on our minds, too, whether we're 60 or not. Come to think of it, quite a few of Neil Young's albums are like that, but Prairie Wind also has images of Canadian geese, buffalo, Indian spirits, a weathered train station, old guitars, dreams, and a girl cousin that sings harmony.rie Wind satisfies at every level.

B000NA1OXY|5.0|What is she like 21 years old? # 1 album as of this writing. I caught her on SNL and recorded her performances and have played them back a few times. If you are looking for something deeper well perhaps you need to be as young as this artist. I am sure she thought what she wrote was meaningful to her. <br /> I like the upbeat tone of the album and like her as a performer. Its too bad people always have to try and classify and categorize artists... she thinks she is punk.. bla bla.  She is doing her thing and it seems to me just about better than anyone else out there. <br />When her first album was released she was all of 17. I was in Peru at the time and I kept hearing the single Complicated over and over. I am pushing 50 and if I can enjoy it I think anyone can get into it. I most likely wont buy the CD but from what I have heard it sounds great!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This DVD has been worth every penny. I had missed the original broadcast so I didn't know what to expect but guided by the reviews here, I was convinced. I popped in the first DVD, and was hooked. Never before had I seen such beautiful imagery, the images touched me. The shots and the speed effects are amazing whether they slow time down or speed it up. The narration is amazing as the narrator sounds like he knows about the subject and is passionate about it. The music used is non-intrusive and perfect for the occassion each time and every time.  <br /> <br />Buy it now and experience the dances of exotic birds, the tactics of hunting dogs, and the pure, virgin beauty of Planet Earth.
B000NA1OXY|4.0|So much for the serious side of Avril Lavigne.  Whether it is because she is now in her early twenties and a married woman or because she did like the way her last album resonated with her audience, the brat is back big time in her third album, \\"The Best Damn Thing.\\"  I would be in the camp that thought Avril Lavigne's second album, \\"[[ASIN:B0001UL7RY Under My Skin]],\\" was a significant step up from her debut effort \\"[[ASIN:B000066NW0 Let Go]].\\"  Fans who preferred the first album and thought \\"He Wasn't\\" was the best offering the second time around, will find \\"The Best Dam Thing\\" a return to her roots as an appealing brat (and proud of it).  Those who would point to \\"My Happy Ending\\" as the best song on the sophomore effort will find this a mixed bag and contemplate the shift in Avril's songwriting partners from the likes of [[ASIN:B00007H044 Chantal Kreviazuk]] to Lukasz \\"Doctor Luke\\" Gottwald (tracks 1-3, 9, 12), Evan Taubenfeld (tracks 7-8, 10-11), and Butch [[ASIN:B000FZESOY Butch Walker]] (tracks 4-6).  Of course, Walker co-wrote \\"My Happy Ending\\" with Lavigne and their \\"When You're Gone\\" is the song here that most sounds like it belongs on \\"Under My Skin,\\" along with \\"Keep Holding On,\\" which came out last year as part of the \\"Eragon\\" soundtrack and seems a bit out of place since the message of its title applies equally well to fighting dragon slayers and enduring teenage heartbreak.<br /><br />The dialectical tension between the bratty Avril and the serious Avril are captured on the first two tracks.  In \\"Girlfriend\\" affirms that she is the \\"motherf___king princess\\" and is promising that she \\"can do it better,\\" while on \\"I Can Do Better\\" the chorus is all about the angry aftermath as she yells out: \\"I hate you now, so go away from me/You're gone, so long/I can do better, I can do better.\\"  I like the energy of the latter song better, not to mention the rhetorical stance of the chorus.  But then I am the father of two daughters and if the sentiments of Lavigne's \\"Don't Tell Me\\" could be programmed into the brain of every teenage girl in the country I would feel a lot better.  However, I have no doubt those teenage girls are more drawn to such thoughts as \\"I just wanna scream and lose control/Throw my hands up, and let it go\\" (\\"Runaway\\") and \\"Waking up I see that everything is ok/The first time in my life and now its so great/Slowing down I look around an i am so amazed/I think about the little things that make life great/I wouldn't change a thing about it/This is the best feeling\\" (\\"Innocence\\").<br /><br />But more often that not some guy comes along and messes everything up, which is why she ends up singing: \\"I hate you why are guys so lame/Everything I gave you/I want everything back but you\\" (\\"Everything Back But You\\").  The opening track matches up with the title song, which also mixes it what I want to call her \\"cheerleader rap,\\" with its bratty declarations (e.g., \\"I hate it when a guy doesn't get the tab/And I have to pull my money out and that looks bad\\").  But then we get to the chorus and its infectious pop hook and the other side of her musical appeal.  You will also find that the line of attack against certain types of women begun back with \\"Sk8ter Boi\\" continues here with not only \\"Girlfriend\\" (duh) but also \\"One Of Those Girls,\\" which reminds us that Avril has drawn not only a vertical but a horizontal axis in the war of sexes.  Whether you call it being empowered or being a brat, that overarching attitude is what ultimately connects all of these songs, summed up in the declaration \\"I'm the one I'm the one who wears the pants\\" (\\"I Don't Have to Try\\").  The bottom line would be that for me \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" is not on the same level as \\"Under My Skin,\\" but I still find it worth listening to and if it takes her an album or two to grow into that serious side she revealed last time then I am willing to wait.<br /><br />You are probably aware that \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" is available in both an explicit and a \\"clean\\" version.  The four explicit tracks are \\"Girlfriend\\" (the aforementioned \\"mf\\" princess,\\" \\"I Can Do Better\\" (\\"sick of this s__t\\"), \\"Everything Back But You\\" (\\"bitch, slut\\"), and \\"I Don't Have to Try\\" (\\"get ready motherf--ker 'cause I'm on the scene\\").  On the \\"clean\\" version of the album with the first two you basically have the __ parts inserted in the song, the third replaces the derogatory words with \\"hey, hey!\\" and the last one has the \\"get ready\\" repeated as a replacement, and this is how civilization is saved.  The irony is that musically the clean versions end up sounding a bit better, because in terms of rhetorical implications it really strikes me that Avril is drawing a line of demarcation.  If you are still on the other side of the great sexual divide and \\"Don't Tell Me\\" sums up your life, then you want the clean version.  If you have crossed over and been seriously burned in a relationship (which almost always seems to be the case), then increasing the intensity of your vocabulary to describe the male of the species will sound like a good idea.  All things considered, Avril's use of profanity indicates her target audience remains the legions of teenager wannabe brats, who will be thrilled by the dirty words even if they are thrown out inartistically.  I would still say that on balance the attitude of these songs will outweigh the outbursts of obscenity for those fans.e four explicit tracks are \\"Girlfriend\\" (the aforementioned \\"mf\\" princess,\\" \\"I Can Do Better\\" (\\"sick of this s__t\\"), \\"Everything Back But You\\" (\\"bitch, slut\\"), and \\"I Don't Have to Try\\" (\\"get ready motherf--ker 'cause I'm on the scene\\").

0393327655|1.0|First of all, let me clarify where I'm coming from here. I'm a big fan of Dennett and Dawkins' books on religion. Dennett's book is wonderfully thoughtful, insightful, and balanced (though I don't know how many theists would agree with the last point, but surely they must admit he tries!). Dawkins is his wonderfully frank self in The God Delusion and though I don't agree with all of his arguments, he does have a number of different arguments to bring to bear on the 'religion question' and they all merit serious consideration. On the other hand, Sam Harris' book is basically a repetition of, more or less, a single point: religion can be evil so it must be ESSENTIALLY evil. Though some of the way he makes this point can be entertaining, especially to those of us attracted to a sceptical position that is suspicious of the potential dangers of religion, most of the book is very self-indulgent and intellectually smug - unable to even imagine how anyone who disagrees with him could possibly be right. I read with amazement his justification of torture in some situations near the end of his book. He rattles off arguments that I would characterize as typical of a very bright undergraduate (so, they're pretty good, if one sided, arguments) who simply hasn't thought through all or even most of the implications of his position. And he rattles these arguments off as if there simply were no response to them. That's what I mean in characterizing the book as smug. Even Dennett and Dawkins (yes, even Dawkins ... at least in comparison with Harris) leave the reader with a sense that there are other points of view that need to be considered in relation to this question. But reading Harris is exasperating in this regard.<br /><br />Bottom line: pick up Dennett's and Dawkins' books on this subject and leave this one alone. If you've got an afternoon, read Harris' Letter to a Christian Nation. It's better by virtue of being significantly shorter.
B000KGGB2A|5.0|But, this is really amazing. I was barely familiar with these guys  because I listen to a lot of American and British indie/alternative until my friend said \\"Remember that song 'I want you back for good' \\"  <br />Uh...sort of.  <br /> <br />After hearing Patience I was hooked and this album is great. Age and experience has served them well.
1400082773|5.0|Well-balanced & modest come to mind when thinking of this book in it's entirety vis-a-vis the author's achievements at the time.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I think some of the reviewers are being overly picky about the picture quality of the this series when you consider it was not shot in a studio but rather in some of the most extreme environments on the plant where there were no second chances to shoot a scene.   <br /> <br />I would agree there are some grainy scenes and I did notice some banding a couple of times, but for the most part this series is pure eye candy.  There is no excuse for the banding, but I'm not sure how a lot of these darker scenes could have been shot without grain given the necessity of having to use fast film.  It's also worth noting that many of the scenes had to have been shot with extreme telephoto lens which only makes getting perfection more difficult, there are times when you can clearly see the image distort due to fluctuations in air temperatures over the long distances.  There is a small amount of SD content within the series, but the majority is HD and mostly breathtaking.  So while there are a few minutes of less than stellar scenes (picture quality wise), there are hours and hours of pristine video and I commend the guys for their excellent work on capturing this footage under these challenging conditions. <br /> <br />The series itself is amazing.  The narration, photography, and storyline are all top notch.  If this series doesn't make you view the plant in a different way, nothing will.  This is a must own IMO.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|This is easily one of my favorites (along with 2112, Moving Pictures, ETC) <br />Now maybe I don't know what i'm talking about but i'm glad they decide to always change their sound. Not every album can be 2112, nor will it be. I liked Vapor Trails very much (regardless if it's not a masterpiece) In fact the only rush album I can't stand happens to be Test For Echo Although i like Driven.  <br /> <br />Far cry is a great song and a Good way to start this album out. Right away you know this album is different in many ways when far cry comes on. It just sounds fantasic to hear the begining of Far Cry. The lyrics are very smart and catchy. (I can get back on, I can get back on)... <br /> <br />I was going to put a breakdown of each song on the album. I think it's better for you to decide about the songs on the album. I will say this, Faithless is a GREAT song, ~if~ you listen to it. Unlike the reviewer that supposedly had a promo copy and quoted only part of that lyric that goes &lt;&lt; \\"I don't have faith in Faith, I don't believe in belief, You can call me faithless, But I still cling to hope, I still believe in love, and that's faith enough for me.\\" >> Faithless is my favorite song on this album (Far Cry and The Way The Wind Blows close second and third.) And it is actually a pretty strong song. When I listen to it I think of neil right away (and maybe it pertains to me too a bit).  <br /> <br />I know most fans will see that I like Vapor Trails and say bad things outloud. But i'm a rush fan for life and I enjoy all of their music (except test for echos...) I throughly enjoy Snakes and Arrows and will be playing it at work, At home, In my dreams, On my way to work, shower and everywhere else I can sneak in time.  <br /> <br />Before you judge this album listen to it. It can't hurt.  <br /> <br />Like a flower in the desert, that blooms only in night, i will quietly resist :)
B000002B2X|4.0|Alice In Chains FACELIFT was a grunge-metal whirlwind that went platinum and introduced the world to Alice In Chains. When it came time to record a follow up, the band went in the studio and came out with a big surprise. SAP, the band's first ep, was a starkly different collection than it's predecessor, and it introduced us to a vastly more melodic and introspective side of the band.  <br /> <br />\\"Brother\\" and \\"Am I Inside\\" are two of the most haunting cuts written by Alice In Chains (both were written by Cantrell and Staley respectively). \\"Got Me Wrong\\" mixes a smooth, melodic side with a blustery chorus, and it was a wisely chosen single. \\"Right Turn\\" is a nice jam session featuring vocalists Chris Cornell of Soundgarden/Audioslave fame, and Mark Arm of Mudhoney. The concluding bonus cut on the album is a silly goof that was wisely left off the tracklisting, and although it cracks me up all the time, it might be seen as more stupid than funny (you have to decide for yourself I found it lightly amusing). <br /> <br />So all in all, SAP is a surprising strong and short collection of songs that show a much different side of Alice In Chains. While the bonus cut does nothing to add to the collection itself, SAP still remains a necessity in the grunge back catalog, and most importantly, in the Alice In Chains catalog.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|To be blunt - there is not an \\"average\\" track on this CD. Smooth, stylish, almost haunting vocals with wonderful arrangements...if I could give this more stars - I WOULD! ...ummmmm sit on your deck at sunset with a nice Sauvignon Blanc...yes...
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|These two actors are wonderful.  Rochester has a charming sense of humor which I loved.  Wow, what if this were a longer, true-to-the-book production.  I would have paid more to see more of these two in the production.
B00000JR29|5.0|the music and seriously.  this is a cd that can easily be listened to numerous times.  The songs are all brought out with such flare and the vocals are done excellent, songwriting is on point as well.  Just everything about each of the tracks.  You feel what Tears for Fears were trying and succedded in doing making a throughly great record from start to finish.  I know many folks have heard \\"Shout\\" if they havent well its really something that has to be appreciated first hand.  It is long but you dont even notice that.  You just find your self all into the song from beginning to end.  Another one that i really enjoyed is \\"The Working Hour\\" it doesnt have to do to much, it just brings out another side of the group that you didnt know.  \\"Everybody Wants....\\" another smash off of this very successful 2nd cd, it takes you from the start of the song and doesnt let go until the song is over.  At that point your ready to repeat it again and even when its done.  The song is still playing in your head which to me is the sign of a good song.<br /><br />Other favs of mine on the cd \\"Head over Heels\\", \\"Listen\\" and \\"I Believe\\".  Also of note the remix for Shout is almost 2 minutes longer than the original version and makes the song that much better as well.  As if that would even be possible.  Also enjoyed \\"Mothers Talk\\" remix as well brings the song into a different light.  I didnt however care for the other bonus tracks 9 through 13, something just felt seriously off with those songs.  But that aside this cd still gets a 5 star rating from me..why?  It does what most artists can't do bring you very quality music at no comprise to the artist making it in this case Tears for Fears.  You guys own!!
B000MZHW40|5.0|This is a very powerful movie that wears its political views on its sleeve.  However, the performances are so good and the story so well done that I didn't really mind being manipulated even as I knew what the writers and director were trying to do to me.  They simply did it and it worked.  Of course, the movie wants us to become aware of the issue of \\"blood diamonds\\" or \\"conflict diamonds\\" and the hell on earth they finance.  When the movie ends we are all supposed to be committed to being sure that any diamonds we buy are not had at the cost of enslaving, maiming, or killing other human beings.  However, the story communicates this on the sides of the main story which centers on a single large and very rare stone worth many millions of dollars that almost no one can afford.<br /><br />The country of Sierra Leone has a tortured history.  It was among the first countries through which slaves bound for North America were purchased in the seventeenth century.  After 1787, Britain founded Freetown much as America founded Liberia, as a place of return for freed slaves. And while it served as the seat for the British rule in the area, its ethnic diversity (at least 18 different groups) has led to nearly constant struggles and fighting.  Its English speaking university, Fourah Bay College, has attracted English speaking Africans from all over the West Coast of Africa.<br /><br />The politics of the period of the movie in the early 1990s are hard to understand because of its sheer complexity.  The movie basically digests it into the Government forces and the RUF (Revolutionary United Front), however, in real life there were additional factions.  The point is that the Solomon Vandy character just wanted to live his life as a fisherman with his family and didn't want to get caught up in any of this gangsterism masquerading as government.<br /><br />The movie centers on a Rhodesian named Danny Archer (superbly done by Leonardo DiCaprio) whose homelessness (because Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and because he lost his parents when very young) is an important theme in the movie.  Is he of Africa or is he a foreigner who doesn't belong?  He has lived by his wits and his ability to fight.  When the movie begins he is a diamond smuggler with all the hazards of that trade.<br /><br />The other important story is about the aforementioned Solomon Vandy (powerfully portrayed by Djimon Hounsou) who is a simple fisherman with a wonderful family that has largely avoided the troubles.  His boy, Dia, is going to school and the family has dreams of him becoming a doctor.  Then the RUF gangs come to his village and their life will never be the same.  In the confusion, the family is fragmented into three groups with none of them knowing the whereabouts of the others or even if they live.  Solomon is actually fortunate to become enslaved working at finding diamonds for the RUF gang.  Solomon finds a huge pink stone that becomes the focus of the movie once he tries to secret it out.  Everyone wants that stone.  Everyone.  And it is that stone that brings all the elements of the rest of the story together.<br /><br />The love interest, such as it is, is supplied by the danger seeking and passionate Maddy Bowen (played just right by Jennifer Connelly).  She is there to find out the story and helps us understand the whole blood diamond trade as well as tease out the background story of Danny Archer.<br />I cannot share any more of the story because you should see it on your own. The hellishness of Sierra Leone during this time is powerfully portrayed on the screen.  If Pittsburgh in the nineteenth century was rightly called \\"Hell With the Lid Off\\", Sierra Leone in the 1990s would have made Hell look like a vacation resort.<br /><br />See it.cause he lost his parents when very young) is an important theme in the movie.

B000003C2U|5.0|...you might as well consider George W. Bush to be one of the most intelligent men to have ever existed.<br /><br />Death is definitely the most respected and groundbreaking bands to have ever existed, and this album, \\"Human\\", signifies yet another chapter of this legendary band. First off, we have the man who made this band (and may he ever R.I.P.), Chuck Schuldiner. This man executes some of the best guitar melodies and standout vocals in the death metal scene. No wonder he was the only standing member of the band. The lyrical content is sophisticated and some of the greatest to ever come out. It doesn't focus on blood and gore anymore like their 80's material, but rather focusing on society and spiritual ways. The other members show their definite talent on this album, with Cynic drummer Sean Reinert behind the kit and delivering some excellent beats, Scott Carino behind bass, and yet another Cynic member, Paul Masvidal, behind the guitars. Every song is memorable and worth your time, especially \\"Together As One\\", \\"Lack of Comprehension\\", and the instrumental piece \\"Cosmic Sea\\".<br /><br />This album is a must, whether you are into ANY kind of metal, or even into musical talent. Death is proof that death metal is still a rising and spirited force.
B0000067L3|5.0|The pinnacle of Cream's achievements. Jack Bruce gives a taste of his considerable talents as a multi-faceted musician: string instruments, bass, keyboards as well as a couple other instruments show how remarkable he is. EC starts contributing more with vocals and multi-layer guitar tracks on the studio offerings. Ginger Baker shows that you don't have to be fancy to be great; the \\"less is more\\" philosophy is evident on \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\"-just enough for the feel of the track without overpowering it. Some bizarre name tracks on the studio offerings but if you can preview them first with an open mind and you may be surprised at how some may start appealing to you (Pressed Rat and Warthog, As You Said). This also kind of foreshadows what happens to groups when they put out a double album--it seems to show them at their peak and most times the offerings that follow just don't seem to have the same energy and appeal. The live tracks show the raw talent of each member without any tricks or gimmicks-just great musicianship. Of course it has the requisite drum solo track that was a part of the '60's rock legacy, but still a great title to have in your collection and a must-have for the Cream aficionado!
B000002BBY|1.0|Wow, does anyone actually listen to this garbage? To say overrated would be too kind...this album should be on the $1 discount shelf, and even then I wouldnt buy it
B0000067L2|5.0|The first real Cream album that showcased the talents of all the members. Some great compositions-\\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\", \\"Dance the Night Away\\", \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", \\"Outside Woman Blues\\", \\"S.W.L.A.B.R\\" (don't ask me what that stands for) and \\"Strange Brew\\". The only 2 tracks that detract from an otherwise great album are \\"Blue Condition\\" and \\"Mother's Lament\\". \\"We're Going Wrong\\" might take a few plays to be appealing. Otherwise the album is a good indication of what is to follow on \\"Wheels of Fire\\" in the studio recordings. I wore the LP out I played it that often. A must-have for any Cream follower.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|After reading the reviews (both positive and negative) on this album, I felt compelled to add my 2 cents. This is a great album.... WAIT!!!! Before you start sharpening your pitchforks let me finish my thoughts. This is a great album as long as you aren't expecting a classic Clapton album, ala the Clapton of Cream or Derek and the Dominos.  <br /> <br />The tracks are more upbeat and hearty than the Clapton tracks that reeled us in, but what do you expect? Art is a reflection of heart, and that has never been more evident than in this album. At long last Eric is happy, after a life of angst that included losing his son (inspiring the song \\"Tears in Heaven\\"), and beating a heroin addiction, the man lovingly known as Slowhand is happy, is that such a bad thing? <br /> <br />That being said, this isn't your typical easy-listening album either. Tracks like \\"one track mind\\", \\"piece of my heart\\" and George Harrison's \\"Love Come to Everyone\\" really let Clapton's musical genius shine. <br /> <br />I gave the album 4/5 stars because although it is a solid album, with catchy beats, stirring lyrics and the brilliance that is Sir Eric Clapton, it lacks the character that has made SlowHand the guitar God that we all revere.

She's still in love with Joe - handsome cop, good guy, protector, but Ranger.....hot, dark, sensitive, listens to classical music for heaven's sake is hot for Stephanie but has told her he's not the marrying kind.

B0000057C5|5.0|Okay, here's a tip: As a fluent German speaker, I understand their lyrics. I also know that most of the translations you find online are dreadful. Rammstein uses a highly idiomatic language from Berlin, and it's rather colorful. If you don't get it, it's hard to translate. \\"Du Hast\\" means \\"You Have\\". The song, however, has to do with rejection. Hence, \\"You Hate\\". Sehnsucht means \\"longing\\", and that's what this album is all about. <br /> <br />Sehnsucht is Rammstein's first \\"commercial\\" album. It lyrics are painful, and for the most part about, well, \\"sehnsucht\\". The rhythms are a blend of punk, techno, heavy metal, and industrial. There's a primal feel to all of their music, and this album is certainly a good example of it.  <br /> <br />One reviewer said it's repetative. So what? So is Phillip Glass. So is Iron Maiden. The Beatles had trouble getting away from a I-IV-V-I progression. Rammstein is doing it for effect. This is very sexual music, and the rhythms reflect that. (If you understood the German, and Berlin idioms, it's a whole lot easier to pick this up.) <br /> <br />Rammstein's lyrics are no worse, and are probably better, than most metal bands floating around the world today. \\"Du Hast\\" hit the airwaves the same time as Korn's \\"adidas\\", the lyrics of which are as juvenile as they get.  <br /> <br />Rammstein is melodic, dark, primal, and, sometimes very witty. They mask quite a few things in ironies, a literary device the Germans haven't forgotten. Check out this album, and then go pick up the other ones.
0151013047|5.0|I found this a gripping story.  Politics really only comes in at the end.  The doomed love affair between Changez and Erica, their gradual approach to physical contact, his habit of delayed gratification, waiting and waiting - all this was beautifully and sensitively sketched.  His gradual, almost subconciously evolving disenchantment with \\"America\\" (meaning the United States, lest we forget the rest of the Western Hemisphere) is a revelation to read.  Had Erica not \\"floated away\\" from him, he would probably not have gone back to Pakistan, although he still might have quit his job.  And quitting his job did not come easy, and when he could have given two weeks notice or finished out the Chile project, he instead quits from one day to the next, commenting \\"But I was done with the fundamentals.\\"  A curious statement.  As another reviewer has pointed out, Changez was rather emotionally detached from himself, and corporate life at Underwood Samson certainly encouraged this.  He simply could not keep a lid on his emotions any longer - and for a week he walks around New York like a madman.  Although there are compelling insights he offers, it is not all wisdom, and probably doesn't pretend to be.  He's still a young guy, and for him all that has happened is that the pendulum has swung completely the other way - \\"America\\" is now a villain.  Is Pakistan a victim?  I don't think so - no more than America is a villain...  Readers should also wonder why Changez is so upset with the U.S. when the tension in Pakistan is with India at the time - and that too following the attack on India's parliament attributed to terrorist groups based in Pakistan.  There is even more tension within Pakistan itself, that has nothing to do with India, although much to do with the U.S. and the war against terrorism.  With all due respect, the book does not get into all of the complexity of politics in Pakistan (or tribal alliances or class struggles), and this is because it does not address the issue of religion...  One wonders about the book's title and the author's intent with the title, since \\"religion\\" is hardly even mentioned or discussed.  Is \\"fundamentalism\\", of any type, then synonymous with emotional detachment?  Is American foreign policy v. Islam a clash of fundamentalisms?  For posing all these questions, this is a great book, and the fact that people are buying it restores faith in the reading public.

B000005JAK|4.0|Why do I have mixed feelings about this record. Well, when I bought it in 1986 my girlfriend had just dumped me and it's Husker Du's first Warner release. Both were pretty traumatic. I had heard \\"Sorry Somehow\\" on the local college radio station and already had two prior Du records (tapes back then) and naturally went to the local Camelot to buy Candy Apple Grey. When I saw Warner Bros. on the box I was shocked. Anyway, I was pretty sure Husker Du was going to make me feel better and they did. There was a song for all my wildly varying moods. Everything from anger to bitterness to melancholy self pity. This is not Husker Du's best work but it is a very solid work that is a clear step in the evolution of Husker Du. I wish they had kicked out another one like this instead of slapping together the totally regrettable Warehouse Songs and Stories. <br />
B00005JKJA|5.0|Genuinely worthy of the intense critical debate that has surrounded it, MULHOLLAND DR is certainly one of the richest American films released in years. The film signals David Lynch's return to the lush cinematographic palette of BLUE VELVET and the first episode of TWIN PEAKS, and a tying together of the themes more loosely (and less satisfactorily) explored in LOST HIGHWAY. The film's twin narrative sections, both centering around Naomi Watts (in a literally star-making performance) have been hugely discussed, with the greatest critical consensus centering around the idea that the first three-quarters of the film are a dream fantasy of the Diane Selwyn character (played by Watts) in the movie's latter section, but even that seems too easy. In some ways, the inability of ever finding a central core meaning to the film seems underscored by the empty blue box that draws the Rita character into its void.     Whatever its central narrative logic, the film is clearly about the promises of Hollywood success and their attendant dangers of failure and humiliation; it also centers upon the attractions of inauthenticity. better than even his other films, Lynch's work here evokes the uncanny with almost incredible power: in the confrontation with the bum behind Winkie's, the disturbing elderly couple smiling too intensely in their ride out of the airport, the \\"Sixteen Reasons\\" lipsyncing number, and the whole extended Club Silencio sequence. Although all the performances are quite fine, it's really Watts, in the dual roles of Betty and Diane, who pulls the whole thing together: in the first part of the movie she makes Betty's earnestness deeply funny, and in the second section she makes Diane's misery extraordinarily upsetting.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|The Spirit of Vengeance rides again! Flaming skull + flaming bike + screwing satan = one great show.

Buy him a spa package to rub the testosterone out of his body. <br /> <br />Any woman that doesn't like this movie is probably the kind who would (try to) make you sell your bike for a minivan. Dump her on a sidewalk as you break all the speed limits to buy this AWESOME movie.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|The CD carries on the same tracks as the DVD which is a PLUS! All the songs are absolutely wonderful and almost as stunning to listen to when you're sitting live at the concert! The DVD that accompanies this wonderful CD is AMAZING! It has some music video's that I have never even seen before and it gives the option of commentary or not. Though I must say I reccomend the commentary to be left on, as Stevie describes her feelings and emotions through out the video's and adds some humorous flare! I found myself laughing through many video's! After you've enjoyed the video collection, you are gifted with some never before scenes of Stevie recording her \\"Bella Donna\\" album in the studio! What a treat! To really get the full impact of the greatness, YOU MUST VIEW THE DVD AND LISTEN TO THE CD FOR YOURSELF! If there was a higher amount of stars I could give then I would! I HIGHLY reccomend this buy! It's a GREAT addition to any fan of Stevie Nicks! **ROCK ON STEVIE!!**
B000KRNG5E|5.0|Inferno is the second film of Dario Argento's unfinished \\"The Three Mothers\\" trilogy (while Suspiria is the first film).  This film is classic Argento with its brilliant cinematography, abrasive yet eerie soundtrack (which seems out of place in certain scenes), brutal/bizarre deaths and sub par acting.  Argento has stated that the actors aren't the focus of his films; rather the environment, mood, story and technical aspects are the potent force behind his masterpieces.<br /><br />One thing about this movie that I found totally surreal and almost fantasy like was the lighting.  The illumination in this giallo creates an ambient and nebulous setting, which is very unique.  The light gels and/or set design in Inferno paint a mood in just about every scene.  These moods vary from precarious (yellow) to foreboding (blue) then tranquil (green) to wrath (red) and back to enigmatic (purple).  This type of movie making magic really plays a huge part in the film.  I've shown Inferno to people before and they might not have liked the movie, but were impressed with the lighting and cinematography.<br /><br />As for the plot, well it is somewhat lackluster.  Mark, who is schooling in Europe, receives a letter from his sister Rose, who lives in New York.  Rose's letter has a sense of bereavement to it, in regards to the apartment she is living.  Rose believes that there are some clairvoyant or supernatural forces at work.  Therefore, this sends Mark to The Big Apple to console his sister.  However, this is the beginning of Mark's disconsolate hardships.  He seems to be putting a puzzle together that doesn't want to solved.<br /><br />Inferno might have to be witnessed more than once to fully digest what has transpired.  However, I have seen it about a dozen times and I still don't know if I fully \\"get it\\".  In other words, the movie can be a bit confusing.  There are also some parts of the film that \\"drag on\\", but it doesn't take away from the overall effect of the movie.  One of the best scenes is the underwater sequence, which is just plain eerie.  There is one scene that involves cats.  I love cats and having them as pets, might make this scene a bit hard to watch.  Nevertheless, many aspects of Argento's films have a \\"pseudo-fake\\" quality about them, so you always know in the back of your head that what is happening on the screen isn't real.<br /><br />As formally noted, Dario Argento's \\"The Three Mothers\\" trilogy is currently uncompleted.  However, the third film is supposed to be completed and released by October 2007.  The name of the movie is \\"The Third Mother\\".  I do hope this is fact and not a rumor.he underwater sequence, which is just plain eerie.  There is one scene that involves cats.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I am one of those Jane Eyre purists who feels like giving a shake to all these screenwriters who deviate from the book. For that reason, the Dalton version will probably remain Number One on my list of Jane Eyre adaptations, especially when I am in the mood for seeing a version that sticks closely to the book.     Having said that, I was thoroughly won over by this version, thanks largely to the lead actors. This is definitely the movie to see if you want authentic sexual chemistry between Jane and Rochester. I felt that this captured the spirit, if not always the text, of the book, because more than once Bronte describes how Jane and Rochester want to be physically close. In this movie you can see the build-up of their attraction.  ****  Having watched this again for the umpteenth time, one of the elements I like best is Jane's declaration to Rochester that \\"I would do anything for you\\" followed at once by her courage in tending to a beat-up Mason with Bertha trying to break down the door. What's not to love about that?
B000B8QEYC|2.0|What went wrong?<br /><br />As an avid listener of Enya since 1988 (when I first saw \\"Orinoco Flow\\" on the UK Show Top of the Pops), it disappoints me that she could release something this sub-standard and mediocre. Where is the beauty of \\"Watermark\\" and \\"Shepherd Moons\\"? We all know that Enya likes to stick to her formulaic music, which is a good thing because she can do it well, and has created some beautiful songs in the process.<br /><br />Remember \\"Ebudae\\", \\"On My Way Home\\" and \\"Storms in Africa\\"? Those were byproducts of the genius that is Enya and her dream team of Roma and Nicky Ryan. On this new album, even though the same team is in place, things go awfully wrong. I would put this down to Enya's inability to move with the times. Now, an artist need NOT move with the times, but when you're making World Music, instrumentation is key, and the problem is, the last five years have seen some amazing world music and Celtic Music releases, that makes this album feel like a footnote in Enya's career, rather than a standout release.<br /><br />I seriously think that Enya's real-life sister Maire Brennan's last album was infinitely better than this. First of all, Enya's voice has never sounded more vocoded or `computerized' than here. The lush melodies wash over it, and though its possibly as beautiful as ever, I have to wonder why they did this to her voice. Secondly, its as if the producers took the same songs from her last album \\"A Day Without Rain\\", and rehashed the SAME melodies for this record. Which is fine, but some of these songs sound exactly the same as the last album. Come on Enya, is this the best you can do?<br /><br />Apparently it is, because lead single `Amarantine' is dead upon arrival. Just listen to it. Its silly, nonsensical, dentist waiting-room muzak, and its not even dressed up passably. The worst part of it is that if you thought Enya's lyrics were meaningless and `filler', you have no idea how pointless the lyrics on this album are. I hate to rain on Enya's parade, but this simply won't do. At one point I thought that this album was probably one of those albums that artists HAVE to record simply to fulfill a record contract obligation (much like Tori Amos' \\"Strange Little Girls\\" - an abomination in its' own right).<br /><br />At the end of it, the whole album comes off as a curious piece that has no business being released in this day and age. The last year has been especially miserable for lovers of true world music, as this tepid CD was followed by the even more misguided `An Ancient Muse' by Loreena McKennitt. Now, Enya and Loreena both have their core audiences, but they seem to have left their true musical roots and genius back in the 1990s (Enya had her masterwork \\"Shepherd Moons\\", while Loreena had her \\"The Mask and Mirror\\"). Now, these two artists sound like has-beens from a bygone era, and they most certainly seem to have `lost it'. I would say that you can skip this mind-numbingly pointless album, and check out Enya's back-catalog - most of her `90s albums are fantastic.<br /><br />On this CD, Enya comes across as bored and lethargic, and the play-by-numbers approach certainly lends nothing special to the music. If that sort of thing is your bag, you might want to check this out (be warned though, that even severe Enya addicts have quit her after the release of this monstrosity).<br /><br />Two Stars. Not Recommended. A huge letdown for World Music.I hate to rain on Enya's parade, but this simply won't do.

B00005JPAO|5.0|While the acting and the story are mesmorizing, and Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen are perfect as the characters they play in the film, the story certainly displays what a total ditz the royal family is.  In an era where royalty is long out of vogue, the British royals seem not to have noticed.  They think they are beyond human beings.  The Queen cares less for Diana's tragic young death than for a poor stag that's been shot in the mountains.  She's either gone senile or she's batty.  Her husband is even worse as an arrogant, snob who makes crass remarks when he hears of Diana's death.   <br /> <br />The fact that their son was responsible for the break up of his marriage to Diana because of his adulterous relationship with a married woman and his jealousy over Diana's raport with the people  shows an insensitivity on the royals part beyond belief.  In a family who should have held their spoiled son responsible for Diana's troubles, blamed him only for not keeping her feelings over his infidelity under wraps.  While the country was in grief, the royals snubbed them, looking down upon their so called subjects with no feeling whatsoever.  Charles was not the only one whose marriage broke up.  As I recall the Queen's sister was also divorced, and her other son, Andrew divorced Fergie, so they have little to be proud of in family matters.  <br /> <br />It's a very good movie and a good reason to get rid of old time royalty.  They should disperse their unbelievabe billions in cash, land, homes and jewels and give it back to their people from whence it came and settle down in a cottage somewhere in the Scottish Highlands.  If they want to keep their mouths shut, and their lives separate from their countrymen, let them return  their wealth to the people and go away.
B000N3SS80|5.0|I bought this album precisely for the reason many other reviewers have panned it.  No, it's not a rehashing of \\"Waiting for Tonight\\" or \\"If You Had My Love.\\"  Yes, most of the songs are ballads.  So what?  It's called TRYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.  I personally do not need to be barraged with more J.Lo. dance cuts.  The title of the album is \\"How a Woman Loves\\" not \\"How a Woman Dances\\" and this is for good reason.  \\"Tú,\\" \\"Apresúrte,\\" \\"Amarte es Todo\\" and \\"Adiós\\"  are my favorite songs not only for their catchy melodies, but because Lopez has allowed her voice to be front-and-center more than ever before.  Sure, the canned audience in \\"Adiós\\" is a little bit cheesy, but the song is intended to evoke a sense of yearning and camaraderie so it actually fits within the context of the song.  <br />Most pop artists are damned if they do and damned if they don't -- people either hate them for doing the same thing over and over or hate them for trying something new.  It's always better to err on the side of innovation.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|Again this is a really bad surprise. This is another example of how you take an exceptional cast and manage to botch up a movie. When I saw the trailer in December 2006 I was looking forward to seeing thi movie about the birth of the CIA. Unfortunately it is way too slow-moving and somehow not that interesting in parts. Matt Damon is good in the role of a future spy-master who is recruited after studying at Yale. He then manages to meet and marry the sister of one of his upper-class friends. How he then manages to become such a grey and rather uninterseting character afterwards is more a problem of the script and probably of the directing. Indeed, while the start is confusing, the rest is worse because it actually manages to get uninteresting. As I write, to have such a splendid cast and to manage to ahve them act well in what could be an interesting movie and make it become such a bore is quite an undertaking. Snore.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|Here I amagain. I just don't get it. This movie had no real character develepment, and no assemblance of storytelling whatsoever. Not to mention an illegal immigration agenda. I heard so many good things about this and when I managed to get through it (which was a task in and of itself) I was like \\"what the hell was that?\\" I guess I'm just not enlightened enough. Stupid movie don't waste your time.
B000065U1N|5.0|This is a life changing film. I always wondered what would motivate an individual to be in a battle field situation and fight when he or she has a choice not to be there in the first place. Yes patriotic feeling and love for your nation would motivate you to do it. But looking at today's war in Iraq no one would think young soldiers sacrificing their life are defending America because it is no threat to America. This film tells you \\"its all about the man besides you\\". Military creates a situation where soldiers are put in the middle of war zone and they fight because even if they don't the enemy is going to. <br /> <br />Very true and thought provoking film. Salute to all the real heroes who sacrificed their life in mogadishu, and to the director for not making and overly dramatic film and being honest in telling the story.
B00005JPEG|5.0|My mother and I had the great luck to be able to see this beautiful film and we have both fallen in love with it.  The brilliant portrayal of Edwardian England, the sweet romance between Miss Potter and Mr. Warne and the delightful scenery of the lake distrect combine to make this a movie well worth watching.  I love that Zellweger is not made up to be stunningly beautiful--she fills her role of the old maid who is surprised by love in a charming, endearing way.  McGregor is perfect in his role as the publisher who loved not only the books but their author.  <br />I grew up on Beatrix Potter but was not familiar with the author.  I was pleasently surprised by this movie, and can not wait for it to come out on DVD so I can add it to my collection.  This is a must see romance and an excelt look into the stiffling social layers of Edwardian England.
1582701709|5.0|To begin with, let's not make this a witch hunt shall we? I have read and re-read many of the \\"reviews\\" on this book, and the vast majority of them are from people who have already, in one form or another, discovered the Secret. So for those people, and I am not knocking you here, this book is quite juvenile. And rightly so, they will suggest you move on to other books that have served them well. Indeed many of us who have only recently discovered this Secret will find more learning along the way. But these people have lost sight of one major clue: <br /> <br />This book was not designed for them. <br /> <br />In plain words, this book is a primer, designed to reach the masses, to be inspirational, relying on more of the emotional punch rather than the hard logical science behind it all. This book was designed to be discovered by the Everyman, not someone who was introduced to it through college-level advanced study. This is what Rhonda Byrne means when she says this Secret was \\"Hidden away\\". It was only available to those who had the money, power or the means to understand it. It has now been given to those of us who did NOT have the benefit of \\"higher learning\\" or a teacher or avatar access to this; a foothold, an open door, an unearthing. So I ask those of you who have discovered and are already on the path not to scoff, laugh, point fingers at or mock this book. Move on, you are on your path, let us find our way. And to those of you who may have been discouraged by their deflating of this baloon, fear not. Don't hesitate one second more. If you want this book, get it, it was meant for you. Good luck in finding your way.

0789723107|5.0|When this book first came out, I read it and found it to be the most practical book I'd ever read on web design/usability. I applied the principles to every internet project I worked on -- with fantastic results. In late 2003, I changed jobs and had to build a massive new website from the ground up. I pulled this book out and found it to to be as relevant that day as the day I bought it.  Today, I'm leading a team who is rebuilding a vast, complex website with many layers of information for nearly a dozen unique audiences.  And once again, I turn to Don't Make Me Think. Still relevant, still on point. As good as it gets.
B000MZHW40|4.0|<br />This is a well-acted movie by all involved.  The storyline is intense and has one consider the larger ethical issues without shoving this aspect down our throats.  Lines get blurred between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" as all three of the main characters have to navigate their way to getting the things they want through a maze of war-torn Africa.   <br />This movie succeeds in presenting an illustrative narrative that brings to light a situation that people across the globe are touched by through an intricate web of economic pressures.  On a lighter note, DiCaprio and Connelly are a sexy pair and have an unpredictable way of relating.   <br />This is a good movie if you want a story with depth and interest.  However, it is very violent so be fair-warned. <br />
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Please folks, get the original movie, not the Director's Cut. The Director's Cut adds additional \\"scenes\\" that add nothing to the narrative and actually dectract from the original presentation. The Director's Cut also horribly mangles the classic and unforgettable soundtrack of the original by removing some songs and reordering the ones that remain. While for some films (Blade Runner), the Director's Cut provides the \\"definitive version\\", the original presentation of Donnie Darko was better left alone. If you feel the compelling need to buy the Director's Cut because you feel that \\"it must be better, right?\\", at least rent the original. You won't be sorry.
0743496728|3.0|I am an avid reader of Jodi's books. I was let down by this one. Considering some of my favorites are My Sister's Keeper, Plain Truth, and Salem Falls...I felt this book was predictable. I was tempted to skim parts to get to the end and I wasn't compelled to pick it up until I decided I had to finish so I could move on.I didn't understand some of the character development. Alex, the mother of Josie (one of the popular girls) is a judge and many times ruminates about not really being a good mother and not always being there for her daughter. Josie never really develops into a character with any core. She feels no one knows the real 'Josie' but there is little follow up to that. She doesn't really seem to know herself. There is always a twist at the end of these books and in this one I think you can see it coming because early on it is clear that there are things Josie is hiding.  <br />My biggest problem with this book is Picoult's portrayal of the 'popular' kids in school as being totally selfish, shallow individuals only concerned with their own place in the 'pack'. She makes a statement that the popular kids don't really have any friends because they are so concerned with their standing.  <br />I agree with the bullying parts of the book, I'm certain that it goes on in a very real way (I work in a large High School). But I totally disagree that 'popular' students 'don't have any friends' and can't be a true friend or wouldn't defend someone weaker because of what their friends would think. Overall, the character Josie was totally spineless, afraid to put forth her true feelings and stick up for anyone or be herself. I certainly hope that isn't true of the majority of teenagers growing up today-and I don't think it is. I see students everyday with an understanding of diversity and variety among the school population who defend their beliefs. The bullies are there but they are the minority.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|People expect the same ole same, and when Rush decides to mix things up all hell breaks loose in their fanbase.  This is a solid album, great production.  I can only dream of producing music of this caliber near retirement age. <br /> <br />Favorite songs are the passionate Faithless and Armor and Sword.  Spindrift has some of the most creative music and The Main Monkey Business doesn't mess around, with a finale 2 minutes worth the ticket fare.  We Hold On wraps things up nicely with some classic rock riffing. <br /> <br />This is a highly political album but very personal to each of us.  The similarities Peart draws between the fanaticism here and abroad is thought provoking.  We're used to being told that how others think is wrong, when in reality we're doing the exact same things we criticize our enemies of doing.
1560100842|5.0|It was like reading a comic book, only I was learning a lot reading this one. An artist cant help but appreciate the art work by Mr Blair present in the book. I went through the alligator and hippo sequences like a million times. Masterpieces !<br /><br />Just by examining the brush strokes and stuff you get to know so much, the discussions on character building etc are a bonus. I wont be able to agree with anyone saying there are hard and fast rules for character building but yes what I read in the book WORKS, like a character with no chin does look like a screwball.<br /><br />Later the discussions on sequencing became a little monotonous and its then that I realized I wasn't reading a comic book but they really were redundant at two three places. Animation techniques discussions are simply great. So are drawing and scene building ones. All in all I learnt a LOT ! Could be because I didn't know a lot but I'm really happy that I bought this book, I couldn't afford to not have this masterpiece.
0765316978|5.0|The Last Colony, by John Scalzi, is the finale to a series (Old Man's War, The Ghost Brigades) on a futuristic society expanding throughout the galaxy.  I have not read the other books in this series.  What I can tell you is that The Last Colony works as a stand-alone book.  I never once felt like I was missing material that affected my ability to understand the plot and the characters (although I suspect I would have enjoyed the book even more if I read the other books).<br /><br />In The Last Colony, a small group of colonists find themselves caught (bait?) between two warring galactic powers.  They are a sacrifice one side is willing to make, and the other anxious to accomplish.  However, the colonists have different plans.<br /><br />Enjoyable to the max.  I look forward to reading more of Scalzi's work.
B000N3SRRC|3.0|I think few would argue that Blast Tyrant & Exodus are by far the Clutch's best.  The song writing on this release is just not as strong. This one reminds me of Pure Rock Fury which also had weaker songs. It also has hints of Elephant Riders in that it is a very organic rock album but Elephant Riders in my opinion has much better songs.  Beale Street has some great straight ahead playing and is rock solid but I was just hoping that Clutch would continue in the direction of their last two albums but take it further.  In addition, lyrically the album is not as strong as it's Blast Tyrant or Exodus either.  I will say that the mix is great and the album is rockin' but it just isn't their best.  But even a so so Clutch album kills the other garbage that is out there.
B00005JLT5|5.0|An excellent film made even more dramatic in that elements of Polanskis actual life are included in the film. Take the scene where Szpilman is pulled to safety by his old friend who has now become a guard, he runs away but is told by the guard \\"Don't run\\" (I assume in order to not raise suspicion) In the book he is told to \\"Run\\" These words are actually from Polanskis life in the Ghettos when he was given the chance to flee.<br /><br />This film has got to be one of the best 2nd world war films you can find, simply because it is one mans story, one 'ordinary' mans story of survival in almost impossible conditions.  The German officer at the end is quite rightly a symbol of hope that there is still good in the world.<br /><br />This film may not have received the same attention as Shindlers List perhaps because while that film is about the collective horrors of the 2nd world war this is more the story of an individual.  Still that takes nothing from the film.  5 stars and highly recommended.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|While this album is good, I don't personally consider it an improvement from the last album.  The piano elements that were so intricately woven into nearly every song on Absolution are, for the most part, missing from this album.  While some traces of it remain, it does not have the same epic classical feel that nearly every track on Absolution had.  For example, a completely instrumental version of Absolution was released and could stand very well on it's own.  I don't think the same thing could be done with this album. <br /> <br />The band stated this was an experimental album, and while it was definitely a good album from a band that stands high above the rest of today's bland offerings, I personally found Absolution and Origin of Symmetry to be better albums.  But that's just my opinion.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|If a soundtrack is better than the play, something's up.  _Wicked_ is IMPRESSIVE.  Everything from the technical elements to the artistic choices amazed me in the Chicago production.  On the soundtrack, there are a few songs I consistently skip, but there are others one just can't help hum afterward.  The witches ACT through the songs and still manage to remain lyrical.  _Wicked_ and its soundtrack are what musical theatre should be.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|Picture this: a band of guys that are barely adults come out of nowhere and create an album that although doesn't sell a WHOLE lot (well, in the U.S., anyway), it makes such an impact that it was the fastest selling debut album EVER in their native England, and it was even nominated for two Grammys in the States. Yes, I'm talking about Arctic Monkeys and their electrifying debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not. But then the question is, how do you measure up to something like that? The answer: make an album like Favourite Worst Nightmare.<br /><br />I initially thought the Monkeys would be taking a break after bassist Andy Nicholson quit the band just before last year's North American tour (which I wish I was at, but it doesn't matter; nobody ever comes to Milwaukee anyway). But in came new bassist Nick O'Malley, and he blends in quite well with the other members. Alex's songwriting is invigorating as always, and he and the rest of the band continue to impress, as shown by tracks like \\"Old Yellow Bricks\\" and \\"Teddy Picker\\".<br /><br />One song that I have to mention, though, is the lead single \\"Brianstorm\\" (not brainstorm; \\"BRIANstorm\\"). That's the album's opening track, and the way those guitars start just blow you away AND invite you in at the same time. It's also interesting to hear a few mellow tracks that don't sound so clich&eacute;d, like \\"Only Ones Who Know\\" and \\"505\\". Speaking of romantic tunes, \\"The Bad Thing\\" is pretty funny.<br /><br />I also like the metaphorical \\"Balaclava\\" (which is the proper term for a ski mask; at first I thought it was a unique way of saying \\"baklava\\"), but my favorite song on the album would have to be...hell, ALL of them. I don't know what's more impressive, that the Monkeys made another great album, or that they did it all in less than forty minutes. Whatever the case, pick up Favourite Worst Nightmare NOW.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000HIVQD0|5.0|This is a terrific re-release of the classic first album, with extraordinarily improved sonics -- as clean a cd as I have heard in a while.<br /><br />The songs are all great, but I want to comment on James Honeyman-Scott's guitar.  He was a real stylist, a spare, efficient guitarist in total control of his pitch and sound, even on his first record.  Incredible.  Though I hear some Television licks in there now and again, this guy was as original as Chrissie's utterly unique voice.<br /><br />I'm always iffy on tacking on outtakes and demos to what are already-great records.  The question I always ask is why?  Do we need a demo of \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" tacked onto the magisterial ending of Wish You Were Here?<br /><br />That said, I think it was smart to put all the odds and sods on a second disc, that way the listening experience of the first record remains complete.  There are no revelations in the outtakes, but there are a few good b-sides and completists are no doubt very happy to have them.<br /><br />This is pretty much a must-have record, as vital today as the day it was released.
B000O75F7C|4.0|There is no doubt that PT is one of the better current rock groups, and \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" is another gem from this talented band. The only other discs I've heard by PT are their previous two and \\"Stupid Dream\\" and for me, this is on par with those releases. <br /> <br />The title track punch starts the disc with upbeat rhythms and a catchy although limited chorus. The verses rule on this tune. \\"My Ashes\\" is a spacey ballad with some awesome string arrangements and this is one of my favorite tunes on the disc. \\"Anesthetize\\" starts off sounding a little like Radiohead with a quiet medium tempo groove; the tune builds slowly adding distorted guitars, heavier rhythms, a decent solo by Alex Lifeson and then some frenzied riffage takes over briefly. The last five minutes of the song are very mellow but tasty, almost Floydish. \\"Sentimental\\" is medium tempo hypnotic tune that borrows a lick from \\"Trains\\" towards the end of the song. The entire band wrote the music to \\"Way Out Of Here\\", nice job, they should write more songs together. Another spacey intro builds into a heavy section with some tricky drum fills and double-kick work. The soundscapes by Fripp add a creepy vibe to parts of the song. Great tune. Finally, \\"Sleep Together\\" is kind of a popish tune with a repetitive keyboard rhythm that bounces through most of the song.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a solid album with no filler and would be a good beginning for someone new to PT, but I'm not sure why it's causing so much argument between fans.  <br /> <br />
0321399536|4.0|Frankenstein is a great work, though one that has consistently been underrated and misrepresented.  Frankenstein is, in the words of Donald H. Reiman, \\"the most seminal literary work of the Romantic period\\".  In my opinion, it is a work of profound and radical ideas, written in poetically powerful prose.  Frankenstein is not really a gothic novel, although its author sometimes employs gothic conventions and language, and even spoofs them.  Rather, Frankenstein is an enduring myth, a novel of ideas, and above all, a moral allegory about the evil effects of intolerance and prejudice, ostracism and alienation, both to the victims of intolerance and to society at large.<br /><br />  I'll concentrate on thisparticular edition -- the Longman edition edited by Susan J. Wolfson.  Most importantly, this is the original 1818 edition, rather than the inferior, bowdlerized 1831 edition -- which is the most common, and the only one that was available for well over a century.  Unfortunately, this edition can not be recommended owing to the typeface, Bodoni, which makes the text hard to read and makes it difficult to concentrate.  Bodoni can sometimes be effective as a display typeface, but it is never appropriate for extended text.  This is too bad, as there is some good material in the back.  The best editions of the 1818 text are those edited by James Rieger (Chicago) or by J. Paul Hunter (Norton).<br /><br />  Please check out my own book, The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein, which makes the case that Frankenstein was really written by Percy Bysshe Shelley, one of the greatest poets in the English language.  I also argue that male love, both idealized and demonized, is a central theme of Frankenstein.<br /><br />  Five stars for Frankenstein, three stars for this edition.
B000O174CM|5.0|Dreamgirls was a real showstopper.  If detractors could just see past the original Broadway show and accept it on it's own merits then they would have to agree it was a great movie.  It's a musical and it was the music and the costumes that blew me away.  Jennifer Hudson is no Jennifer Holliday; but she held her own and did a remarkable job.  Jennifer Holliday is a legend and Jennifer Hudson's performance takes nothing away from that fact.  Understand they are two different and very talented singers.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed Dreamgirls and saw it twice because I enjoyed it so much.  I bought the CD and played the songs for weeks after.  I am buying the DVD today for the same reason; I just love it and I loved Jennifer Hudson.  I also loved to hate Jaime Foxx's character in the movie.  Beyonce did a good job and so did Eddie Murphy.  All in all, it was a top shelf production.  It deserved even more award nominations. <br /> <br />-Idrissa Uqdah <br />
0393964582|5.0|Frankenstein is a great work, though one that has consistently been underrated<br /><br />and misrepresented.  Frankenstein is, in the words of Donald H. Reiman, \\"the<br /><br />most seminal literary work of the Romantic period\\".  It is a work of profound<br /><br />and radical ideas, written in poetically powerful prose.  Frankenstein is not<br /><br />really a gothic novel, although its author sometimes employs gothic<br /><br />conventions and language, and even spoofs them.  Rather, Frankenstein is an<br /><br />enduring myth, a novel of ideas, and above all, a moral allegory about the<br /><br />evil effects of intolerance and prejudice, ostracism and alienation, both to<br /><br />the victims of intolerance and to society at large.<br /><br />  Since there are some good reviews here, I'll concentrate on this<br /><br />particular edition -- the Norton Critical Edition, edited by J. Paul Hunter.<br /><br />This is one of the two best editions of Frankenstein available (the other<br /><br />being the Chicago edition edited by James Rieger).  Most importantly, this is<br /><br />the original 1818 edition, rather than the inferior, bowdlerized 1831<br /><br />edition -- which is the most common, and the only one that was available for<br /><br />well over a century.  Hunter's introduction is not bad.  Some of the reviews<br /><br />and essays in the back are good, and some are not, but this is par for the<br /><br />course.  The main text is intelligently annotated.<br /><br />  Please check out my own book, The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein, which<br /><br />makes the case that Frankenstein was really written by Percy Bysshe Shelley,<br /><br />one of the greatest poets in the English language.  I also argue that male<br /><br />love, both idealized and demonized, is a central theme of Frankenstein.

B00008WG3U|4.0|Fat Mike knows how to write a good punk song with great harmonies.  But the only thing that bothers me is how one-sided everything is.  I mean, that's expected in the genre of punk.  But what bothers me the most is how Fat Mike points the finger at the rednecks and calls them ignorant.  Now I myself am a democrat, but I think it's equally ignorant to just nod along and agree with everything this band preaches.<br /><br />Besides that, it's a pretty solid album.  Key tracks: \\"13 Stitches\\" and \\"Whoops, I Od'd.\\"
0385333846|1.0|I had heard that this author died recently so the name of Slaughterhouse five had surfaced in my consciousness because, while I had attached it to the author, I had never had a chance to read it, and find out what it was about. I thought the title was quite cool, and I knew that it was a science fiction novel--and I'm all for that: science fiction and a good read.  <br /> <br />But I have to say, with all due respects to the author, this is the WORST book I have ever read in my life. It is disjointed and hops all over the place. There's no continuity at all. The prose is terrible. The back cover says it is funny without laughing, splendid art, a book without tears. Wrong! I am actually crying: that I paid so much money for this. I gritted my teeth to finish reading this book. <br /> <br />When I logged onto this site, I was amazed that so many people gave this as high a rating as they did. I thought more would feel as vehemently as I did, but alas, not. I guess I am not cerebral enough (or maybe too cerebral) because I--do--not--get--this--novel. I am always admirous of writers and wish to praise them for their efforts when I like the book, but I couldn't here. I gave it what I think it deserved. (And why does he keep saying 'so it goes' all the time. Geez, that phrase is just annoying me now. That phrase would be okay if it was used once or sparsely. But over and over again!!!!!!!!!!!!!) Save your money and buy something else!
B000N6U0E2|4.0|The Pursuit of Happyness is a movie with Will Smith as the main character. the Pursuit of Happyness was a very sad movie, yet it makes one wonder what was going to happen next.The sad thing about this is when the family splits apart, because they can not afford to live with one another. The boy and his dad eventually end up staying nights in a type of homeless shelter. The kids mother mobes and works with part of her family in another state. At the end of the movie, te father got a big time job and ended up getting a home with his son.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Mr. Bublé's latest record has once again proved to be another album full of quality and quantity. \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\" is one of the best cuts from the album. Although his voice is stellar, some of the arrangements could have been rethought. \\"Dream\\" is an example of this, Nevertheless, Michael Bublé continues to be the one voice you never tire of. He also seems to be one of a select few on the music scene who have any real talent. It's also great to see an album and an artist produced in 2007 that does not have to lower itself to the level of filth and vugalarity. It's about time someone brought back some decent music. I heard him sing \\"This Guy's In Love With You\\" in concert once. I do hope there is the possibility of that song making it onto an album or single in the near future. A must for any fan of good music.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|Musically, this is Rush's best effort since Roll the Bones.  The drums and guitars are more creative (emotive) than they have been in years.  Lifeson is inspired and intense.  There is less concentration on technical precision and more on the structure of the songs.  As was the case for Vapor Trails, Test for Echo, and Counterparts, there is a dearth of melodic hooks, but the band makes up for it through forceful phrasings.<br /><br />That being said, the only really disappointing aspect of the CD (so far) is Peart's preaching of a tired secular dogma.  He is certainly a great poet, but his ability masks an emptiness of content.  A friend once asked me the old question of whether I would prefer to drink a prized and vintage wine from a cheap cup, or a cheap wine from a jeweled goblet.  I can't recall what my answer was then, but Peart's beautiful lyrics masking a nullity of thought resembles that jeweled goblet filled with Mad Dog 20-20.  At one point, Peart suggests that we might call him \\"faithless.\\"  On the contrary, Peart's faith in a Voltaire-era Enlightenment Creed remains absolute and unchallenged by any tinge of reality.  I am saddened for him, for his was a great mind.  I wish he would open it again.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|4 1/2 Stars.     Is this CD a return to the late 70's era Rush sound? No. However, one must look at that concept as a two-edged sword: If they copy an older sound, despite how dexterous their playing may be, it's still in a sense \\"Regressive,\\" rather than \\"Progressive,\\" the latter being a primary element that defines this band.     And every new work should be judged on it's own merits. With that said, let me summarize my feelings about this album now.     First of all, standout vocal tracks: \\"Far Cry,\\" \\"The Way the Wind Blows,\\" \\"Spindrift,\\" & \\"We Hold On.\\" All three of the instrumentals are excellent in their own right. Additionally, \\"Faithless\\" & \\"Bravest Face\\" are very good, I'm just not quite ready to commit them to the level of \\"standout.\\"    To elaborate: \\"Far Cry\\" is probably the catchiest single since \\"Dreamline,\\" and also rocks out nicely - this will be an excellent concert song. \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" is just amazingly vast in scope. Bluesy, Rocking, Melodic & even Mellow, the track runs the gamut and succeeds in being a truly intriguing and different piece. As for \\"Spindrift,\\" this track has a very insistent hook that refuses to be forgotten. \\"We Hold On\\" is a great, peppy & somewhat quirky closing track. Each of the instrumentals is a somewhat different animal. \\"The Main monkey Business\\" is very broad in scope and pulls out most of the stops. A superb instrumental and better than other more recent instrumentals from the 90's era. \\"Malignant Narcissism,\\" albeit brief is the biggest burst of flexed musical muscles on the CD - I wish this track had been developed into a full length piece. And \\"Hope,\\" Alex Lifeson's 12-string Acoustic solo piece is simply beautiful.     \\"Faithless\\" is a good track that's growing on me and \\"Bravest Face\\" is very surprising. In particular, Geddy's vocal maturity, and the vocals he delivers at the end of the song especially, are a nice surprise. The remaining tracks are all very good quality, just don't jump out quite as muchas the others.     I was very critical of their last CD, \\"Vapor Trails,\\" for two reasons: First, the sound quality was absolutely horrible. And second, the lack of Alex Lifeson as a LEAD player. To address those previous concerns...    First, the engineering and production on this CD are top notch. This is Grade A sound quality, and completely \\"crankable\\" while still remaining completely clear. Not a hint of any unwanted distortion.     Second, Lifeson returns to the forefront. Are there any solos that match \\"Freewill\\" or \\"Limelight?\\" No, not really, but there are a lot of different solo textures... \\"Faithless\\" and \\"The Larger Bowl\\" offer nice solos in the more traditional Rush sense. While \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" and \\"Bravest Face\\" offer some of the bluesiest licks Lifeson has ever committed to a studio record of new and original material. The latter offering a shockingly clean tone, and the former offering a nice big beefy and loud blues rock tone. Several others abound (including an albeit quick, but very rapidly executed little solo in \\"The Main Monkey Business.\\")    I noticed several reviewers have commented that the disk can be plodding at times. I can't disagree. I believe the sequence of tracks that are early in the record (tracks 2-4) contributes largely to this. This album is not as heavy as Vapor Trails, nor is it mellow.     In summary, this isn't as great as the 'classic' era, nor does it sound like that era, but taken on it's own merits, it is a beautiful CD.
0393320928|4.0|What Do You Care What Other People Think? is sort of a sequel to Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman.  As a whole this book is not as good as Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman.  Part 1 of What Do You Care What Other People Think? is excellent and is very similar in tone and content to the earlier book in that it contains anecdotes of Feynman's youth, travels, and work at Los Alamos, and a touching account of the untimely death of his first wife Arlene.  I recommend it highly (with only one qualm, see below).    Part 2 is an account of Feynman's work investigating the space shuttle Challenger disaster.  This part contains some interesting material but it seemed incomplete, technical in odd ways, and I found it hard to follow--actually impossible to understand fully.    Feynman's epilogue on the value of science is simple-minded, and IMO unworthy of publication.    Let me repeat:  Part 1 is fascinating and is a valuable supplement to Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman, but one thing that bothered me is Feynman's hostile attitude to philosophy.  Here is a particularly annoying example:  Feynman is discussing how he helped Arlene with her philosophy homework.  Feynman attacks Descartes' proof for the existence of God.  Feynman has Descartes' argument summarized fairly accurately and gives one of the standard refutations (offered as his own brilliant idea).  All of this is sophomoric, literally, in that it is standard fare in intro to philosophy courses, but Feynman presents it as though he is this daring iconoclast, uprooting the stuffy philosophers.  I quote:  \\"Arlene understood me.  She understood, when she looked at it, that no matter how impressive and important this philosophy stuff was supposed to be, it could be taken lightly--you could just think about the words, instead of worrying about the fact that Descartes said it.\\" (p. 29)     Of course this is just what philosophers teach in intro to philosophy.  This is philosophy!  Take nothing for granted, question everything,\\"The unexamined life is not worth living\\" (Socrates).  Feynman is a brilliant physicist and wonderful story teller, and he's had a wild life, but his attitude to philosophy is uneducated and uninformed.  Feynman especially should appreciate our philosophical heritage.  One of Feynman's valuable contributions is that he has been something of a gadfly in the spirit of Socrates, the founder of philosophy in the Western tradition.    Finally I find the title annoying.  Of course you care what other people think, and so do I and so did Feynman.  Why else would he relate his anecdotes, tell us the story of the death of Arlene, and so on?  Indeed, Feynman strikes me as quite sensitive and concerned about other people and their thoughts.

0671015206|4.0|Chris Rock once explained the difference between being rich and being wealthy very succinctly. He said Shaquille O'Neil is rich but the guy who signs his cheque is wealthy. When you are rich you can loose all the money when you're a big spender, live beyond your means or try to keep up with the Jones, also known as tom. The education system creates a society of consumers and that is a fact. Nobody in particular is to blame except yourself. When you stay blinded to the reality of life you continue to suffer. The signs of success can be overt and people may pay attention to you for a little bit longer. When it's not over they may ignore you completely.<br /><br />This leads me to Millionaire Next Door. The person who recommended this book was non other than Tom Leykis, the American talk radio host. He is a self-made multi-millionaire and brags about it often. In fact it only seems like bragging when it's taken out of context or when you are jealous of his success. I'm not. I'm a admirer. He speaks honestly and directly about the reality of the world we live in. So I recently picked up a copy of this book, ordering it online as do most of my shopping these days.<br /><br />This is not an easy read because it has heavy emphasis on numbers, statistics. Something which you may not enjoy reading because again the school system creates a society that dislikes mathematics in any shape or form. Now the research has been done by two Ph.D's and you can't fault the depth of their analysis. They surveyed large groups of millionaires and high income producers for several decades. This book is a very good snapshot of the research and you can start to see the common sense almost boring methods by which the millionaires become millionaires.<br /><br />Here's the most common denominators:<br /><br />1. They live well below their means.<br /><br />2. They allocate their time, energy, and money efficiently, in ways conducive to building wealth.<br /><br />3. They believe that financial independence is more important than displaying high social status!<br /><br />4. Their parents did not provide economic outpatient care.<br /><br />5. Their adult children are economically self-sufficient.<br /><br />6. They are proficient in targeting market opportunities.<br /><br />7.

B000NVIXFK|1.0|Sadly this is just more of the same uninspired and predictible music that plagued their last studio album.  What happened to the brilliant orchestrations that characterized Rush music for such great works as Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows,  Roll the Bones and Counterparts? <br /> <br />It seems like the Canadian power trio has devolved into a self indulgent formula.  None of these tracks really seem to stand out.  I honestly felt like I was listening to the same song through the entire album. <br /> <br />Rush really needs a creative producer to bring out their best.  A producer to challenge their writing skills and push them to orchestrate their sound... <br /> <br />A producer to save them from themselves.  Unfortunately, Nick Raskulinecz couldn't accomplish this.
B0001L3LUE|3.0|What happens when supposedly great men, upon closer examination, turn out not to be so great, after all? What happens in this particular case is a piece of icon-washing fostered by Errol Morris who apparently couldn't think of a better subject to film a documentary about.<br /><br />All the accolades regarding this film would lead one to believe that it is about a titanic human individual who achieved great things, but when one actually watches the film, one sees nothing of the sort. Robert McNamara, a man who, in early pictures and footage of himself, is so bursting with arrogance and self-importance that he all but glows, played Mephistopheles to Kennedy and Johnson up until about 1967. That is to say that he provided these men with war strategies and troops and generally brought about the means by way of which their wars could be fought.<br /><br />Errol Morris is an expert filmmaker and, as usual, his film is graced with the hypnotic music of Philip Glass, whose soundtracks are all but indistinguishable from one another. Indeed, the soundtrack from Koyannisqatsi might have been substituted here to provide exactly the same effect. Morris's camera angles and editing are never boring, but this viewer does not share his fascination with his interview subject.<br /><br />McNamara evinces guilt about his involvements in war and appears on the verge of tears in many scenes as he recalls difficult decisions made about the Vietnam war. But as the film winds down, it becomes evident that McNamara is proud of his \\"achievements,\\" although it is difficult to see how sending 58,000 young Americans to their deaths can be regarded as an achievement to be proud of. McNamara would have been better off had he remained as the head of the Ford Motor Company. Perhaps then his \\"achievements\\" that he is so proud of might have really added up to something instead of a head full of phantom shadows and dead soldiers.<br /><br />It is generally considered bad form to give low ratings to an Errol Morris film, and this viewer certainly agrees that he is a very good filmmaker, indeed. Unfortunately, here his choice of subject matter fails him, for McNamara is rarely insightful regarding his role as Secretary of Defense. One comes to the film expecting McNamara to shed light upon obscure happenings, or to reveal dark secrets about what went on behind the scenes, but no such luck. In effect, all McNamara can muster up is a half-hearted \\"that's the way it was.\\" There are no insights on the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the back of the DVD case promises, and the stunning revelations regarding the Cuban Missile Crisis amount to nothing more than that in those days, we actually came close to nuclear war and that it was only averted by sheer luck. Hmm. The film suffers throughout from this kind of glibness.<br /><br />McNamara just isn't that interesting. Whatever his talents as a CEO, this is not a man given to insightful philosophical speculation. And it shows in the superficial comments that he makes about war being \\"just human nature.\\"<br /><br />Nice try, Mr. Morris. Next time, how about doing a film about somebody who really deserves the time and expense spent upon them?<br /><br />--John David Ebert, author of \\"The New Media Invasion: Digital Technologies and the World They Unmake\\" (McFarland Books, 2011)viewer certainly agrees that he is a very good filmmaker, indeed.

B000O178BY|4.0|How timely that Reznor and company should put out \\"Year Zero\\" right about the time of the Virginia Tech shootings. \\"Year Zero\\" seems ripe with everything that's wrong with American society today. Reznor is no stranger to angst-ridden songs, but on \\"Year Zero\\" he makes more razor sharp political allusions than on any of his previous recordings. This is what freedom of speech is about, the power to rail against an oil tycoon president, the indifference of the American masses, the violence that's just beneath the calm veneer of civil working class American citizens.<br /><br />The titles and the industrialist music point the way with \\"The Beginning Of The End\\", \\"Survivalism\\", \\"The Good Soldier\\", \\"Vessel\\", \\"Capital G\\", \\"My Violent Heart\\", \\"The Warning\\", \\"God Given\\", \\"Meet Your Master\\", \\"The Great Destroyer\\", and \\"Zero-Sum\\".<br /><br />While I would not go so far as to say that \\"Year Zero\\" is Reznor's best work, I would say that it's the best in a decade, perhaps better than 2005's \\"With Teeth\\".<br /><br />If you're looking for an alternate perspective on U.S. culture from the watered-down, talking-head version fed to us by the nightly media conglomerates, then check out \\"Year Zero\\".
B0002O7XVI|4.0|I didn't read the novel so I have no comments about the accuracy of the adaptation.  I had no problem understanding it.  (Some reviewers said that it was necessary to read the book in order to follow the film.)  I had no problem, either with the length.  In fact I was glad it was so long; I wanted to get \\"the whole story\\" not a compressed version.  <br /> <br />The photography, as others have mentioned is exquisite.  It's worth seeing again, with the sound off, just to see the gorgeous country shots. <br />The music was perfect too--just right for the mood of the film--not too intrusive. <br /> <br />Nastassja Kinski was perfect as Tess.  I can't imagine anyone else playing the role.  All of the other principle actors were just right and gave excellent performances.  How we loved the divine Angel until his rejection of Tess on their wedding night!  <br /> <br />The whole film is gorgeously earnest and deeply felt.  The only reason I subtracted one star is that the story is just so damned depressing!  Knowing what we do of Polanski's life, one can see how he'd be attracted to such material, but for me...I would have preferred some happiness and joy for poor Tess. <br />

B000NVIXFK|2.0|As they say, best not to get your hopes up. And that's certainly true with this latest CD from Rush. Being a Rush fan from back in the mid-1970s, I was eagerly waiting for this new album. Perhaps too eagerly. When I finally got my hands on it last week, I found I was underwhelmed.  <br /> <br />It's a bland, boring album. Not one of the tracks stands out as something extraordinary, or even good enough for a Rush song. And this was supposed to be a return to the \\"classic sound\\" of the Band.  <br /> <br />I didn't like their previous album Vapor Trails because of the mixing and other things, but that is better than this new CD.

If you've seen the movie, this book will be an important addition to your knowledge of the situation in Sierra Leone.

Despite the difference in ages, the mindset of someone confronted with killing and war in a world isolated from their home can be seen in our armed forces overseas as well.

If you have read Calvino's story and remember its construction I think that you will enjoy seeing how Mitchell has elaborated upon the theme and produced something utterly original. This is one of those books that can be lumped in with a handful of others from each decade and be pronounced a classic of its time. I think reading afficianados will be looking back at this book with more and more affection as time goes on.<br /><br />One item I kept coming across before reading this book would be the oft stated fact that Mitchell provides the reader with a tour de force mish mash of narrative styles. He does so here like a master of his craft. This is a series of stories that fit nicely together and work with one another, each story is set in a different place and different time and Mitchell gives each of them its own feel and place. He packs so much into each page that you will be washed with a sense of place and character unique to every setting. The stories themselves delve into such different narratives and plots, you will be both confused and captivated.<br /><br />I would really like to read this book again in a book group setting where you could discuss each story and the unfolding pages with others as they occur. I dont often feel that way, its just that this is such a wonderful book, and so crammed with small details, I really would enjoy seeing how others react to them.<br /><br />GET THIS BOOK!!!
B000MCH5P4|2.0|I have to admit that I was initially compelled by this film when it started.  This was quickly replaced by seeing countless, useless scenes that did nothing to propel the story or make the point that the director was trying to make (I assume he was trying to point out something with this film).<br /><br />If he was trying to show how things are inter-connected, he failed.  Are we supposed to be angry with the Japanese man for selling the gun to the Moroccan man because it was used in a tragic shooting?  That would be the same as if I sold my car to a man who then used it to kill someone in an accident.  The logic simply doesn't fit.<br /><br />Was the director trying to show how incredibly stupid people are?  Two Moroccan boys deciding to shoot their gun at a tour bus; a Mexican woman who takes someone else's kids across the border into Mexico without thinking about the consequences; a young Japanese woman who is so distraught regarding her mother's death, that she's attempting to get any man's attention through sexual advances.  If the director was trying to demonstrate the stupidity of people, he almost succeeds.<br /><br />There isn't enough characterization in this movie to make me feel anything for any of the characters in this film.  The only tragedy that I felt sad about was Susan (Cate Blanchett) being shot.<br /><br />Quite simply, what was the point of these three intersecting story arcs?  When a director/writer fails to get this across, I'm afraid that he's failed in what he's tried to do.  It doesn't matter to me if this film was recognized by some critics and also at the major award shows.<br /><br />There are too many scenes in this movies that have no bearing on the story.  What is the point of Amelia making out with a man in a phone booth?  Most of the sexual scenes in this movie do nothing to move the story.  They're simply there for sex sake.  Is it really necessary to show a young boy masturbating to the image of his older sister getting dressed?  Why is this important to what happens later when he shoots the bus?<br /><br />This film could have been so much better had we been allowed to really know the characters.  The Japanese girl had the best characterization.  But we still needed more from the other storylines.  I wish that the entire movie had been about the Japanese girl since her story was the most compelling, but there was still not enough of it.<br /><br />All in all this film was different, but not in a good or effective way.

I wish that the entire movie had been about the Japanese girl since her story was the most compelling, but there was still not enough of it.  <br /> <br />All in all this film was different, but not in a good or effective way.  It was simply a disappointment.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I'm not really one to write reviews, mainly because I'm no good at it, but I feel like I need to write my thoughts about this release.<br /><br />First let me say that I've been a HUGE fan since the late-70's when I was 10. I'm a drummer since way back, know all their releases intimately so I think that I may be a qualified fan ;)<br /><br />In my opinion, this release has got to be their best release since Moving Pictures and in time, may actually take that spot in my archives to be second only to 2112. The sound is very modern, but yet very old-school Rush with many tracks reminding me of their Permanent Waves / Hemispheres era with, again, a modern twist. Other reviewers have stated that no single song stands out, I agree, but that's because every song is a masterpiece in its own right.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This has been such a long running movie series that it can be hard to remember all 21 films.  I have to say that this was one of my favorite Bond movies that I've seen in a long time.  I did enjoy Pierce Brosnan (at least in Goldeneye), but the Bond series had just gotten too campy.  I didn't think I would like Daniel Craig as Bond, but he really suprised me.  Casino Royale gave a good slap in the face to Bond so that we wouldn't have to watch another satillite reflect the sun's heat onto an ice hotel by some billionare who used to be Korean but had plasic surgery to change his identity....ahhhhhh!   <br /> <br />Anyways, the first scenes in the film are action-packed.  You will not be bored.  I felt that the movie paced itself well, but the end seemed to be a bit bunched together.  It kind of seemed like they were running out of time and they had to rush Bonds relationship with Eva Green's character.   <br /> <br />I've seen every Bond film, and this is one of the few that I purchased.  It was cool to see the story of Bond's early days and just achieving 00 status.  Even if you don't like or haven't seen the other Bond films (like my girlfiend who hated almost all the other Bond movies...but liked this one), it's still a very entertaining action film.  Go and see it!

0374105235|5.0|The book is one of the greatest!..pure and simple..    It is very sad that the western world somehow has got numb to the notion of 'peace' in Africa and the leaders sublimly assume that \\"genocides\\", rebels, ethnic cleansing, government overthrowing etc as normal than exceptions.. I picked up the book after noticing it for sale in Starbucks and began reading...and read on and on and on..    As a [..] kid, evolving from being an social dancer who loves to dance and sing  moving on to become a kid whose sole purpose of life is to 'survive' and get through yet another day..somehow managing to do it again and again.Surviving the barbaric rebels, Wild Animals, Witnessing burnt bodies in village square, his own friend dying with food poison, arguing your case in front of barbaric village chiefs to spare your life, Walk and walk till you can see flesh peeling of your foot..and then starting to enjoy his new found role as a drug addicted killer..    However noble or lousy theme, a book has to be measured in terms of the way it is written and in this perspective, Ismael scores big.Words and sentences have been carefully chosen to bring his feelings ,fear, sorrow ,smile , anger on the paper, paragraph and chapters clearly segregated, makes me wonder if there was someone who guided him to write this masterpiece..afterall English is not his first language...    This book is not for faint hearted.You cannot hope to fast forward and hope it would go away..Read the snippets below to decide if you want to buy the book. (remember, this is a kid who is witnessing )     \\"\\"\\"\\"There were people locked in the house..The fire was already too much inside....only two people came out., a woman and a young child.They were  on fire,and ran up and down the village,slamming against everything in their way and going back in the other direction to do the same.the woman felll  and stopped moving. The child gave a loud screech and stopped moving.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|For a band I have been listening to since the first album, back in 1974, I have a peculiar aversion to listening to their earlier albums now. I have more Rush albums (either in LP or CD mode) than any other band in my collection, yet I find them hard to listen to now. Still appreciate them a lot, and hold them in high regard, but I'd really prefer my Sabbath, Deep Purple and Blue Oyster Cult discs than the old Rush. I guess that's what makes this new one so great. I find it to be extremely LISTENABLE! And I love the increased use of acoustic guitars (Alex took the advice of David Gilmour about using more acoustic in his writing, and Alex took it even further to include the instrument on nearly every song!) That, and the excellent production values of this album give the songs great space and breathing room. No longer content on 'look-at-me!' chops and instrumental prowess at the expense of songwriting, this album has everything I have ever loved about them. Geddy's singing settles nicely into the mix more these days, Neil is not the show-off he once was (we all know that there is no better!) and Alex can let the band support him under some nice solos again. I agree with those who say this is the best the band has done in years. And I finally feel a need to dig out \\"Hemispheres\\" again!
B000OLTBL4|1.0|A disappointing mess that was trying too hard to match the Lord of the Rings in fight scenes and offered little in the way of inventive plots or diverting characters. And who thought it would be cool to see dragons fly around with the speed of fighter jets? Blah.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I try to reserve my 5 stars for truly classic, masterpiece albums, but this is as close as it gets, so what the heck. <br /> <br />The opening track starts with an anxious, repetitive tritone-laden guitar riff that builds up the verse, with Wilson singing about a troubled, angry and bored kid.  This alternates with a contrasting chorus of power chords and minor tonality, with lyrics peering deeper into the child's psyche to find confusion and fear.  A chilly piano figure comes in at the bridge, like a skittering spider.  In the coda at the end, the tempo slows and the lyrics offer no solution to the despair; only a litany of questions. <br /> <br />\\"My Ashes\\" offers the typical lush harmonies of other PT ballads.  This one is awash in strings, with some interesting modulation.  Though it may lack the build-up of, say, \\"Lazarus,\\" it's an interesting piece nonetheless. <br /> <br />The album's centerpiece, \\"Anesthetize\\" (which, conincedently or not, falls in the middle of the album), is a totally engaging and compelling piece of music, leaving the listener anything but \\"anesthetized\\" by the end.  Don't let the opening Thom Yorke-inspired vocal fool you; you're in for a different kind of ride.  Harrison's heart-pounding drumming is really the highlight of this track, putting you in a rhythmic trance one moment, and then nailing your a** to the wall the next with a death-metal double bass drum or a lightning tom fill.  Odd-time intrumental passages dominate this track, with sung verses coming in seemingly at just the right time.  When the chorus finally arrives around the 8-minute mark, it's big, bold, and one of PT's best.  A nice guitar solo backed by a melotron closes the track.  In unskilled hands this could be a recipe for a prog disaster, but in the hands of Wilson & crew, it fits in just right. <br /> <br />The energy continues on the remaining tracks, with an emotion-filled \\"Sentimental,\\" and a really great guitar solo featured on \\"Way out of Here\\" (Robert Frippalso adds a subtle and tasteful soundscape).  It's songs like \\"Sentimental\\" and \\"Anesthetize\\" that demonstrate Wilson's equal ability as both a song writer and instrumentalist.  If there is a weak moment on the album, it may be \\"Sleep Together,\\" but even here we have an interesting lyric with death/sex ambiguity, and some dissonant strings in the background. <br /> <br />This may be PT's best work to date.  Whereas it may have been justified to label some of the melodic-acousti-pop-meets-death-metal fusion attempts of past PT albums as failed science experiments, it's no longer the case with Fear of a Blank Planet.  This is a compelling and cohesive work, and the musical genre-crossing transitions are seemless.  PT have raised the bar again after In Absentia, which is a feat in and of itself.   <br /> <br />My advice is to buy it. <br />

B000LT2IHI|1.0|I thought my 9 month old would love this since he really likes other toys with balls (drop and roll dino, busy ball popper).  But he has shown very little interest in this one.   <br /> <br />The balls are too hard to get in the mouth (there is resistance; hard for a baby).  Also, he loses interest even if he does get the balls in the mouth - seems to be because the balls don't always come out the same exit.  While I thought the fact that they are random would be fun, he doesn't like it.  He's just now learning cause and effect so the randomness doesn't interest him; it's not repeatable.   <br /> <br />As for a toy to use while standing, I've found it not stable enough since it tends to tip.  And he has trouble pulling himself up - the handles are awkward to get to so he pulls at the ball track.  Once standing he finds it awkward to reach around the base to get the balls after that.  <br /> <br />This is one toy I wish I hadn't spent the money on.  On the plus side, my dog seems to enjoy it - she's figured out how to set off the music by pressing the button on the nose with her chin.
1582701709|1.0|I have to admit, this book reminded me of my university essays,lots of retoric with lots of quotes thrown in.  <br />The positive affirmations of the 1980's meets Anthony Robbins. If you want to seriously think positive thoughts read \\"You Can Heal your life\\" by Louise Hay, this book does not compare and gives no tools. Referring to quotes from Winston Churchill, who by the way led troops into Anzac Cove, yet not including quotes from the Dali Lama. Basic psychological understanding of how the mind works when one is angry..IE: the monkey brain, and how to recognise this state of feeling and how one needs to behave to recognise it and deal with it, are not mentioned or purely ignored. Statements such as \\"milk your happiness\\" and \\"Turbo Charge Your Life\\" are simplistic marketing, offering false promises charged by incorrect quotes such as \\"we only have two types of feeligs Good and Bad\\".. <br />Human Beings need words of substance, people need tools to help them recognise feelings and how to deal with them in everyday situations.  <br />Read the Dali Lama, louise Hay or see a councellor..Save your money..
B000LC55F2|5.0|The Prestige is a stunning movie on many levels: wild story, well-resolved plot, period piece beauty, great acting and a Sixth Sense style reveal that drops the steam punk tale firmly into scifi.

0375507256|5.0|I just can't see myself giving this book less than 5 stars, even though there are sections of it I found long-winded and overwritten: I'm thinking particularly of the post-apocalyptic Hawaii scenario with the Burgessian patois at the far end of this circle of narratives, before one begins circling back.  My favourite narratives were those of Timothy Cavendish and Robert Forbisher.  Why? - I enjoy highly literate narratives full of wit.<br /><br />Those who enjoy the Burgessian patois or screenplay action/adventure narratives will have other favourites. In some respects, reading this book is like holding a mirror up to your own literary likes and dislikes.<br /><br />I cannot agree with other reviewers that the book is fundamentally Pynchonesque.  Pynchon is a parodist, a mere parodist as far as I'm concerned.  You don't get much depth out of him, lots of oh so clever verbal pyrotechnics-Yes.  But that's about it.<br /><br />Mitchell here tackles larger themes.  Some of the other reviewers have mentioned them: Mankind's self-destructiveness via Nietzschean will to power, the individual versus society, the reliability of narratives in general etc. All quite true and thought-provoking -  But the real puzzle of all puzzles this book addresses is the age old question of free will versus determinism, or fatalism seen through the trope of reincarnation, which is rather fun to follow through the different characters.  Every narrative has its own take on this question, many offering quite profound meditations on it.  Do we really \\"make choices\\" or is the phrase just a semantic construct for the firing of neurons in our brain? Are we merely the products, as Scottish philosopher David Hume puts it, of a \\"concatenation\\" of events? This is the question the book poses, deeply embedded in each narrative, time and again.  The answer: None.  While the book, taken as a whole, may seem to lean toward determinism,.  the puzzle is unsolved because it's unsolvable....unless one has a Cloud Atlas, and we don't, just a book about one (or several, actually).<br /><br />As a minor character in the second part of the Luisa Rey Mystery (on the way back around the circle, so to speak) puts it: \\"Funny, thinks Milton.

B00005JPPI|2.0|Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) is a smart man.  A very smart man.  In his spare time, for instance, he constructs elaborately gold and silver contraptions that send crystal marbles on endless, dizzying loops, around and over and under and back up, the cogs and wheels turning inexplicably, inconceivably, pointlessly.  These devices are beautiful and fun to look at -- one of them towering almost four feet high -- but they are ultimately useless.  They don't do much other than divert, and even that in small measure.<br /><br />\\"Fracture,\\" a courtroom thriller from the same guy who made [[ASIN:0780622537 Fallen]] and [[ASIN:6305127697 Primal Fear]] (Gregory Hoblit) wants to be as smart and intricate as those marble roller coasters, but it is only as diverting.<br /><br />The set-up is interesting (and Hoblit's detail-driven directing make even the splashes of water on Hopkins' face look luxurious): Crawford comes home early one day and shoots his adulterous wife in the face.  Several hours later, he has been arrested.  Signed and verbal confession.  Murder weapon in hand.<br /><br />The open-and-shut case is handed down to a clever-n-clean-cut Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), an attorney on the way up to bigger, brassier waters, about to start work at a prestigious nickel-and-iron law firm, moving on from his down-home grass-roots spot at a small legal house where his prowess is not-so-subtly resented by everyone but the cute-as-a-button secretaries.  One last quick case, thinks Beachum, before he packs his bags and starts working for the Big Dogs.<br /><br />Of course, it's not so simple as all that.  It turns out that most of the evidence is inadmissable because the arresting officer, Rob Nunally (Billy Burke) also happens to be Crawford's wife's lover.  As the locks on the case begin to disintegrate, so does Beachum's handle on his career, notwithstanding the brief (and weirdly directed) affair Beachum begins to have with his soon-to-be boss, Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike playing every upwardly-mobile, take-no-guff female attorney that's ever come out of Central Casting).<br /><br />The linchpin of the case -- and of the entire movie -- rests on finding the murder weapon.  Everything else is background noise.  The problem is, the script makes it pretty obvious where the weapon is.  We can see where that marble is going just by tracing the gold-plated track, so the destination is no surprise at all.  And since the entire story -- quite honestly, the entire story -- swivels on the fulcrum of that supposed tension (up to the excruciatingly slow revelation that Beachum has at the end), the entire story fails.<br /><br />I'd give points for Hoblit's competent directing and even for the acting.  Hopkins and Gosling are both powerhouses, one well-established, the other proving his mettle with every new film, but the lines they say are old, the \\"twists\\" they tread are so old, they've been worn into a rut by countless movies before them.  And their conflict -- the brash, young upstart (a brilliant man, really) versus the wise, studied maestro (an equally brilliant man) -- doesn't get much play time.  Even when it is on-screen, it's a mostly uninteresting battle of egos.<br /><br />Very little is at stake in \\"Fracture,\\" and even less is worth noting, and it's all because of the plot.  Fine acting and decent filming are like well-sculpted mahogany frames and gentle ogee pathways in an over-large marble maze-way.  They look pretty, they move just as prettily, but after five minutes, it gets old to watch.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|My introduction to this CD was a commercial wherein I heard Beatles music.  Beatles music on commercials drives me MAD.  Remember the Philips or Panasonic commercial that used \\"Getting Better\\" with the \\"can't get no worse\\" carefully cut out?  Or the recent Macy's campaign that used a cover of \\"From Me to You\\"? during the holiday season?  I agree: it DOES get my attention, but maybe not in the way the advertised entity was hoping.<br /><br />What I saw was a commercial for the Cirque show, \\"Love.\\"  I remember wondering how much they had to fork out to get the rights to air and use the songs, and didn't think of it again until someone else was playing the CD and I heard some of the cool, seamless transitions and sound quality that I can only describe as jaw-dropping.<br /><br />While I think some more of the songs could've been interestingly \\"messed with\\" more (since that's essentially what this is, after all), this is a great CD -- worth having to hear the new, beautiful takes from a respectful, knowing source whom I still think of as the \\"fifth Beatle.\\"
B000O75F7C|5.0|This review is not really a review but more a strange (to me) historical comment. I was recently \\"turned onto\\" Porcupine Tree by Rush- I heard that Alex Lifeson was a guest guitarist on Anesthetize. I am 46 years old and have been a Rush fan since 1975 (well before most of you smarta** commentators were born : )  What is fascinating is that PT sounds nothing like RUSH but I absolutely love this music.  This contradiction requires serious scientific investigation. Alex Lifeson likes them- and I'm guessing many other Rush fans will love this music even though it is very un-RUSH like. Many people have commented on PT's progressive style- but it has a very metal overtone as well. My 46 year old ears will certainly go deaf listening to PT- but I can't resist. Remarkable music- and I thought real music died long ago...Thank God for PT
B000NA77YO|5.0|Sixteen track compilation of Sabbath's stand-out repertoire of when Ronnie James Dio fronted them. Tunes here are pulled from the lp's 'Heaven & Hell' ('80), 'Mob Rules' ('81) and 'Dehumanizer' ('92) + there are three newly recorded tunes, all three are good. I literally have chills going up and down my spine when I hear these British metal gems, like \\"Neon Knights\\", \\"Die Young\\", \\"Mob Rules\\", the awesome \\"Voodoo\\" (simply been too long), \\"Children Of The Sea\\" and so on. For any of you out there that may've been too young or in some case{s} not even born yet when this material first hit the streets, TAKE it from someone who was lucky enough to catch this band's 'Heaven & Hell' tour with Blue Oyster Cult as co-headliner (anyone else remember that?), it RARELY gets any better than this. Highly recommended. LONG LIVE BRITISH METAL!
B000NA28I4|2.0|As a movie, it's fine and enjoyable.  As a movie based on the fantastic book Eragon, it falls far short.  This movie had the potential to be epic - in the league of Lord of the Rings - but instead we are handed just another dragon movie.  It is the kind of movie you expect to find on TV on a quiet Sunday afternoon.  It is very enjoyable as long as you don't expect it to be epic, as it should be based on the book.   <br /> <br />I was disappointed in all that was left out.  One of the impressive things about the book was the development of characters and their relationships, but this is entirely lacking in the film. If you watch this movie, set your hopes for it low.  It is an enjoyable dragon movie as long as you expect it to be just another dragon movie, but it does not live up to the book.

1400062756|4.0|Carol Dweck doesn't try to pick a fight with the Self-Help Industry, nor does she address any of its dogmatic statements head on, she simply demonstrates that too often what passes for \\"self help\\" advice these days and his impact on IBM contributes to a \\"fixed mindset\\" that leads to the opposite of success.<br />Our society values motivational speech so much that motivational speech has become a good in itself and motivators see themselves as good people.  People who praise are considered motivating, while people who hold their praise are seen as de-motivating.  As a result, teachers, coaches and bosses are appraised by their ability to gain results where the bar has been lowered rather than raised.<br />The fault of this book is in the anecdotal style that Carol Dweck has chosen for this book.  In discussing the world of athletes and CEO's, Dweck seems to be talking about a world she only knows second-hand and from insider accounts.  Does she really believe everything Lou Gerstner says about himself and his impact on IBM in his autobiography?<br />On the other hand, the anecdotal style is most effective in her chapter on raising kids.  Is there anyone who reads that chapter who won't think a second time about praising their kids for being \\"smart\\" and \\"brilliant.\\"  Instead of puffing up their little egos, Carol Dweck makes a powerful case for teaching them other (traditional) abilities, such as hard work, humility and, above all, resilience.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Talk about a band that had it all and pretty much threw it all away.  Guns And Roses is the classic example of a band that came from nothing, hit the big time quickly, and then flushed it down the drain in a sea of drugs, alcohol, greed and general vice.  The fact that they treated their fans like [...] did not help matters either.  Showing up hours late at concerts or not showing up at all.  Having hissy fits in the middle of shows and walking off the stage.  It is really amazing to me these guys have maintained the audience that they have given the way their fans have been treated.  This is a band that could have been the biggest hard rock band in the world, but basically blew it.  Still, there is no denying that they produced some great rock n roll.  The band really only put out 4 studio albums, so most people who are big fans of the band probably already have most of what is on this disc.  As a compilation it is a decent collection.  Naturally there is a lot of material from \\"Appetite For Destruction\\".  The two \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums are both well represented as well.  My all time favorite G & R tune is probably \\"November Rain\\" which is here in all it's symphonic glory.  Several covers are also here including Bob Dylan's \\"Knocking On Heaven's Door\\", Paul McCartney's \\"Live And Let Die\\", and The Rolling Stones \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\".  All in all this is a decent collection if you just want to get the band's best known songs.

0393324818|5.0|Mr. Lewis has really created a gem in \\"Moneyball.\\"  It's hard to imagine a book about sabermetrics and statistics becoming an interesting and compelling story.  Lewis has someone melded together a character study of Billy Beane along with the revolution of objective statistics in baseball in a way that doen't make people roll their eyes.  This book is truly wonderful and probably one of the most important books on baseball since Bill Jame's baseball extracts. <br /> <br />On top of the interesting bits regarding the behind the scenes workings of a major league ball club is something even more substantial.  This book can change the way the reader views all levels of baseball.  What should high school coaches teach regarding hitting?  This book suggests patience and knowing one's strike zone.  Should pitcher's be worried about arm strength or deception?  The book could easily be used to help coaches of all levels of baseball groom young players to be more effective ballplayers.  It will even help those coaches with game strategy.  In that sense this book is revolutionary.  Sabermetrics used to be for a special class of baseball fan who spent more time at their computers than actually watching or playing baseball. <br /> <br />Now sabermetrics belongs to the masses. <br /> <br />And just imagine if this book sparked interest in applying objective criteria in other areas of life.  What's the best way to manage a group of office workers, who is the best candidate to hire for a particular job, how can a business owner use previous sales numbers to formulate a strategy for the future?  It may seem like a stretch but this book could change the way readers think about a whole host of issues, some not even close to relating to baseball. <br /> <br />Everyone can learn a lesson from this book and no baseball fan or businessmen should go without reading it.
B00070DK5K|4.0|As one of the lucky few who witnessed this show live, I am admittedly biased in my review. The music was only half of the show as Bowie and an unbelievable stage-crew produced a all-out video production that was brilliant. The costumes,settings,props and especially the cherry-picker(what?) helped magnify a fantastic display of Bowie at his glitter-age best. The set-list was great, highlights of Bowie's career to date plus a couple unexpcted songs. The band was tight and the most talented,rounded ensemble he had used until then. I remember the album and casette version of this show as being hollow and poorly produced. But this improved version on cd is much better, almost as good as being there. And considering this was originally recorded over 30 years ago(100 years in technology years) it's great to hear this record-setting tour has been preserved for the ages. My only regret is that there isn't a comparable video to make a complete dvd. Now that would be something special!

B0000046JP|5.0|Like most classical lovers, I had a decent recording (that got a Penguin rosette) of this concerto and had heard it numerous times on radio.  Somehow I never felt this concerto has been played to its full potential.  When I hear Paco de Lucia, I am glad someone finally did it full justice.  In Flamenco, in jazz or in classical, Paco de Lucia's musicianship always touches heart and souls.  I am not surprised that the composer himself calls this the greatest performance of the concerto, and I can't think of why any classical guitar lover wouldn't want to own this CD.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|Just when I'd written Maiden off, thinking there was no way they could come back after the somewhat disappointing Dance Of Death, they release A Matter Of Life And Death.  Not only that, but the album has the same feel as Dance Of Death, but they actually accomplish the progressive feel without getting repetitive.  This is the best album since Bruce rejoined the band, perhaps the best Maiden release since Powerslave. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with what at first seems to be a standard Maiden starter, with a fast metal riff and a verse reminiscent to that of \\"The Wicker Man.\\"  The chorus of \\"Different World\\" shows that this is a different world indeed, where Bruce throws away his trademark shriek for a more melodic tone.  And somehow it works. <br /> <br />\\"These Colours Don't Run\\" has a verse that sounds like a chorus.  Very catchy in that Maiden way we've come to know.  Also has the accomplished progressive feel the band seemed to be aiming for on Dance of Death without losing the epic edge the band had on previous releases. <br /> <br />\\"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\\" has a cool riff, but unfortunately goes on for a tad bit too long for my tastes.  Also sounds a bit like a redone version of \\"Paschendale,\\" except I like \\"Paschendale\\" better.  Still a good track. <br /> <br />\\"The Pilgrim\\" is another good track that falls short of the excellent standard set by the rest of the album.  Unfortunately, it gets swallowed up by the other tunes, so is not as memorable as it could have been. <br /> <br />\\"The Longest Day\\" begins with Harris' classic slow gallop and a haunting guitar riff.  Dickinson proves yet again that his voice is as good as it ever was.  \\"The Longest Day\\" is thankfully not too long.  About five minutes into the song, the guitar takes off, leading into a solo reminiscent of early Maiden but still with the modern vibe. <br /> <br />\\"Out Of The Shadows\\" reminds me of \\"Children Of The Damned,\\" and is a great song although the chorus does get a littlerepetitive.  This time, however, the band keeps it relatively short (my main gripe about Dance Of Death is that the songs are long with the chorus being repeated over and over again). <br /> <br />\\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\" kicks off the epic four set at the end of this album.  All songs at this point are over 7 minutes long.  I really like the way the song starts, and when Bruce starts singing, you already feel like you've started on his journey.  Then the Sabbath-like riff kicks in.  Wonderful song. <br /> <br />\\"For The Greater Good Of God\\" is the longest song on the album, clocking in at 9:24.  This song starts out sounding like it belonged back on the X Factor.  Thankfully, Bruce and not Blayze comes in, and all is well.  Bruce once again shows why he belongs with the mike.  His vocal range absolutely destroys on this song. <br /> <br />Following that, there is \\"Lord Of Light,\\" and on this track, Bruce actually sounds a bit like Blayze.  But not for long.  He starts screaming in true Dickinson fashion.  This song could easily have been on Number of the Beast without sounding out of place. <br /> <br />The closing track, \\"The Legacy,\\" is probably my favorite on the album.
0316113077|5.0|This book is amazing!  It gives all the little details you need to make an amazing work of art. <br /> <br />I also have to say that when my 21 month old daughter saw the Chinese take-out cake she said, \\"Dinner?\\"

B000O77SOK|5.0|I have been checking the local stores about the release of this amazing TV series that has grown up with me with lots of tracing and enjoyment. Eventually, having resolved those strategic issues (thought it couldn't be technical or legal or else), marketers 'produced' them and made them available to us.  But we had to wait another month, vs 10 years from the original production?   Strange marketing plans.  Can't wait to get them out here in Hong Kong and hopefully it will get distributed in the right channel and more importantly in the right prices.    Look forward to have these titles helping me to pick up my childhood's memories.
B000PUAHOY|5.0|`Inland Empire' is full of surprises.   Convoluted and suspenseful we follow the story lines of successful actress Nikki (Laura Dern) who is waiting for the results of a tryout for a new Hollywood movie, `On High in Blue Tomorrows`.  Soon she is visited by her new Polish immigrant neighbor.  In her nosey way she pries information, but also intensely warns her of bad omens.  She foretells that Nikki will obtain the part she has tried out for, but the story, is a remake and a murder will take place.  She intensely relates folk tales, including one about a girl at the marketplace in an alley behind the palace who loses her memory.  \\"Forgetfulness happens to us all,\\" she relates.  She also incessantly speaks of \\"unpaid bills\\" in a scathing fashion.  Rebuffing the neighbor's pointed comments, the actress asks the suspicious elderly woman to leave.  The movie fast-forwards to the next day as the woman foretells in the narration.  The gypsey fades out with a vengeance.  Nikki gets the part, and on the set we meet Devon (Justin Theroux), her dashing, handsome co-star. The director (Jeremy Irons) facilitates a script reading where he relates that the film is indeed a remake; one that formerly had a spousal murder.  From here the movie weaves its way through many scenes.  Nikki's husband warns the young co-star of the consequences of sneaking out with his actress wife.  Some feature Southern characters Billy and Sue in the movie, but they are so closely connected to their actual lives that we begin to lose our own grip on reality.  Eerily suspenseful scenes show (Nikki or Sue) walking through a house in bewildered trepidation.  Then, we are transported to the lives of the screen couple in the backyard.  Next, we find them in Poland during the dead of winter.  In one scene the actors are having an affair; in another the characters are.  To spice things up, we get a play with actors in rabbit costumes performing an absurdist comedy.  At certain points, just when we feel grounded, a woman is watching all the drama on television in her dark apartment.    The developments of `Inland Empire' are intriguing.  Like `French Lieutenant's Woman' (significantly also with Jeremy Irons) there's a movie story mixed within a real story.  Unlike `FLW' it isn't easy to tell where one story ends and the other begins.  In ways like Altman's `The Player,' we have to decide what components are real and which are not.  One finds oneself asking many questions while watching the movie.  Which parts are from the movie?  Which parts are real life?  Are the scenes in Poland real or are they components of the original film?  Is this all seen through a viewer's eyes or is it all part of the movie?  Is she crazy or is her character crazy?  Surely,  the theme of misogyny  is at the forefront as we come across prostitutes and male abuse.  One thing is for certain, the movie is assembled expertly.  It comes across like a mansion full of mirrors--as in a fun/haunted house.  Not everyone will like the exit strategy, but it certainly provides a strange and intense experience.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Coming about five years after their last studio record (2002's \\"Vapor Trails\\") and three since their last studio offering ('60s covers EP \\"Feedback\\"), Rush's 18th studio effort, \\"Snakes & Arrows\\", has been highly anticipated amongst the fan community, if nothing else due to producer Nick Raskulinecz's comments of this record being a return to the band's '70s sounds.  I've found over the years there's a desire among fan bases to see band's recreate their old favorites rather than moving on-- witness the recent popularity of recreation of classic albums live, reunion tours, bands returning to their \\"classic sounds\\", etc.  As someone who's all for progress and has always loved Rush primarily for their willingness to keep looking forward and finding new sounds, I can safely say I was a bit nervous.  While their restlessness has produces its share of bunts over the years (1996's \\"Test For Echo\\" being the most recent), it's produced a number of great records that could only have existed with the bravery of changing sounds.  I mean, we're talking about a band that redefined progressive metal (\\"2112\\", \\"A Farewell to Kings\\"), found commercial success (\\"Permanent Waves\\", \\"Moving Pictures\\") and abandoned it time and again to embrace everything from new wave (\\"Signals\\"), synth-driven rock (\\"Grace Under Pressure\\"), alternative (my personal favorite Rush record, \\"Counterparts\\") and a noisy, almost punk sound (\\"Vapor Trails\\").  Thankfully, upon listening, Raskulinecz wasn't quite correct.    What I suspect he was aluding to wasn't so much a return to a sound but rather to a way of working-- to complexity and layering, to many of the things that made those '70s Rush records so interesting but without regressing to create a \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" Part II.  \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" finds its textures primarily in guitars and guitar-like instruments, indeed Alex Lifeson is credited in the liner notes as playing \\"six and twelve-string electric and acoustic guitars, mandola, mandolin, bouzouki\\", and all of these are pretty clearly evident-- doubled, tripled on a given piece, providing a swirling platform under which Geddy Lee's growling bass and Neil Peart's typically fantastic drumming can reside.  There's also some limited keyboards on this record, Lee is credited solely with the melotron, but I'm wondering if there's not some modern key snuck in there.  They're used in a decorative capacity largely, similar to how they were used on the band's early '90s records.  But it really is the acoustic guitars that stand out, they're all over the place, and not just as introductions but instead informed throughout.    This textured sound is readily apparent from the start-- opener \\"Far Cry\\" starts off with a churning introduction before settling into a bouncing riff that wouldn't've been out of place on \\"Roll the Bones\\", a great crisp bassline and a catchy chorus.  Likewise, similar layered textures can be seen on the largely acoustic \\"The Larger Bowl\\", Lifeson's acoustic is countered by Lee's growling bass and a staggeringly confident vocal that almost makes you wonder where it came from, or on completely intriguing \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\".  Opening with a brief blues-rock passage that could have come off of a Cream record (or \\"Feedback\\" for that matter) before settling into a throbbing rhythm with just a superb vocal from Lee, maybe his best.  Along the way, there's also standout alternative-tinged \\"Spindrift\\", tension-driven \\"Faithless\\", downright affecting 12-string acoustic guitar solo \\"Hope\\" (which beautifully captures its title) and a brilliant, brief and totally self-indulgent (but in a good way) instrumental in \\"Malignant Narcissism\\".    There's a few tracks I don't really care for-- \\"Armor and Sword\\", clocking in at over six and a half minutes, drags a bit, \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" ends up being a neat but not \\"wow\\" instrumental, and a few of the tracks aren't terribly memorable, particularly towards the end of the record (\\"Bravest Face\\", \\"Good NewsFirst\\", but also \\"Workin' Them Angels\\" early in the disc, saved but superb lyrics).  But by and large, it's an awfully good effort.  Not quite on the band's masterpieces, but certainly it's a piece worth listening to.  Recommended.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This is the most intelligent serie I've ever seen. Lorelai's character has great complexity hidden beneath her great sense of humor and understanding and tolerance. Emily and Richard hide the most common feelings and tragedies that happens to occur in best families. This season, although without Amy Palladino, has been able to keep the original charm. I saw recently one more time the other seasons, observing each one attentively and, I must say, there's the best of life within each character of this serie and i'll miss it so much when it finishes. Thank you Amy Palladino, for your great capacity of writing and for your good taste.
B000GYHVFC|5.0|I'll leave the review of the plot to others, many of them do a much better job.  Suffice to say that I enjoyed this movie, and while it might not be the best movie ever made, it is visually stunning.  I thought so even when I saw it in its standard DVD format. The film goes out of its way to have bold colors and beautiful architecture.<br /><br />All of this means that it has huge potential for high definition, and WOW does this HD-DVD deliver.  It is crystal clear all throughout. There are scenes where you see the characters' eyes, and you would swear that your television is a window you are looking through at them.  If you enjoy this movie and are hoping that it looks even better in HD, let me assure you - it does!
B000LC55F2|5.0|Viewed this after reading some prior reviews, curious if I could anticipate the ending.  While it's true you won't like the key characters mid-movie, the acting was great, and I'm sure most people will enjoy this flick even if they are confused at the end.  How many films can you say that about!
B00005JKC3|3.0|I wanted to love this movie, but ended up just a little disappointed. The story is interesting, but the films pacing is uneven. It does capure some of the feel of the comic book and I thought the CGI Hulk looked good most of the time. I didn't mind the Hulk being CGI, but why did they changed the original story so much?<br /><br />Changing Dr. Banner from a meek book worm into a typical leading man was not the wisest decision. There was no contrast between the two alter egos and this could have been used to there advantage throughout the film. I also felt the story was a bit long sometime tedious. I also thought making the hulk grow to 15 feet was a little too big, it made it even harder to believe those purple pants could stretch that much. When the Hulk was on screen, this film is full of great Hulk action, I loved the desert scene when The Hulk is running towards the tank!<br /><br />In the end, while I liked this film, it ;eft a lot of room for improvement. There was enough going for it, to overlook some of the flaws, but this could have been a really good movie with a few tweaks here and there.<br /><br />I had invisioned a movie like the original Frankenstein or King Kong with a misunderstood monster that just wanted to be left alone......Too Bad. Maybe they can fix the damage with a sequel,....lets hope so! :-(
B000E5KJD4|5.0|There are plenty of other reviews on the plot available here which do a much better job than I could, so I will leave it to them to give you their opinions.<br /><br />For those people who want to know what this movie looks like in its HD-DVD format, let me assure you it is incredible! Some HD-DVDs look like they might have been rushed onto the format, with picture imperfections, etc...not this one. The picture was flawless, I can't recall seeing one imperfection throughout the entire movie.  I had to turn the sound up a little louder than I am used to in order to hear it well, but the sound was magnificent as well.<br /><br />This is one of the cleanest and best transfers onto an HD-DVD I have ever seen. If you enjoy this movie, pick it up on HD-DVD. You won't be disappointed.
0451191153|4.0|The Fountainhead is a fascinating book. The intense love between Roark and Dominique, the idealized rape, the hot sex scenes! A rags-to-riches story of an uncompromising architect, struggling against his purely evil second-hander opponents; manifesting his individual potential via heroic speeches. A man sells his wife to a rich dude for a job commission (Indecent Proposal, anyone?) Tortured suicidal millionaires, love triangles, explosions. Man, it's all there. And it's all wicked awesome. There isn't even any pesky character depth to get in the way of this book's pure unbridled ownage!  <br /> <br />The reason I am giving it 4 stars (instead of 500!) is that this incredible novel sometimes get bogged up in some crappy quixotic philosophy that dumb megalomaniacs tend to accept unquestioningly(probably due to overwhelming pride at having read a 900 page book that is not Harry Potter). Ayn Rand could not possibly have intended this silly Objectivism thing to be taken seriously! What sane person would? Obviously this book is a brilliant satire of what sophistry, irrationality, arrogance, and a smokin' pair of pink sunglasses can do to people's minds. A psychological thriller, so to speak! But if you ask me, all that \\"thinker\\" mumbo jumbo just gets in the way of a slammin' story. I suggest you ignore those parts. Skip over them (you'll be the better for it) and enjoy the literary soap opera concotion of greatness that is The Fountainhead.
B0000062S0|2.0|I was very disappointed with my purchase of this album when it was first released. It was heavily promoted when it first came out and, as a Led Zepp fan since the days of my youth, and one who also greatly enjoyed the latter solo releases by Robert Plant I had great expectations for this album. Sadly it in no way were those expectations met. My copy got played twice, the second time in the hope that I had somehow missed something when I first played it. It has for years sat in a box of old cassettes that never get played. This album seems to me to be more an attempt to cash in on their reputations of a  than as a true artistic effort. Both Plant and Page simply do not expend the energy or show the interest to create an album worthy of their talents. There seems to me to be a sense of hostility between the two of them that could be blocking the creative process.  Don't spend your money on this one. Go for some classic Zeppelin or something by Plant that has some energy and effort in it. This album is souless and lazy.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I got hooked on the show after watching the movie Serenity.  I'm not a big sci-fi fan at all, but my father-in-law got this movie for christmas and we all watched it.  Awesome movie!!  Then come to find out there was a tv show (Firefly) that the movie was base upon!?!?  The writing for both is clever and relatable.  The blending of western/sci-fi is perfectly done!!  I can't say enough about this series/movie!!  Once you find out about it and watch it for yourself, only then does the sadness hit you that they cancelled the show after only 1 season.  (Weeping)
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Though the ghosts of Frank Sinatra and Peter Allen still battle for his soul, in his new CD \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" Michael Buble has finally found his own voice and personality. For those who doubt that his channeling Harry Connick Jr. channeling Frank Sinatra schtick is done, jump to his rendition of the Sinatra signature song \\"That's Life\\" and listen to his unaffected vocal amid the combination of both gospel choir and big band.<br /><br />Looking for other sources of inspiration has led Buble to Billy Paul for \\"Me And Mrs. Jones\\" which is done in a more matter-of-fact manner than the hand-wringing original; to Jack Jones for the title cut \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" which is more laid back than the original despite the big band arrangement; to Eric Clapton whose \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" becomes a lovely Latin love song with assistance from the great Ivan Lins; and to Willie Nelson whose \\"Always On My Mind\\" is a beautiful song which gets the beautiful voice it deserves. A wide variety of sources and styles that Michael masters and makes his own.<br /><br />Two polished diamonds that cement the new identity are \\"Everything\\" in which all previous influences are absent and it is Michael Buble emerging as his own man and the tender and laid back \\"I'm Your Man.\\"<br /><br />Special mention must go to the arrangements which swing when they need to and modulate for the tender moments such as \\"Lost.\\" The upbeat arrangements of \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\" (which can only be described as big band Italian salsa) and \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" (with it's backing vocals from Boyz II Men) are just brilliant.<br /><br />A must for fans and a step towards world dominance by this Canadian superhero, this is a wonderful leap forward for an artist who in the past has been weighed down by his influences. But as he warns us all with the CD opener, \\"The Best Is Yet To Come.\\"
B000060P79|3.0|If the radio hits \\"I'm Just A Kid\\" and \\"Perfect\\" don't instantly thrash you in the face with the entire theme of this album when they first reach your ears, it seems nothing could. Both albums from Simple Plan, the Canadian quartet who have slammed their way into the hearts of thousands of young listeners, have a very adolescent feel, even more so than bands like Good Charlotte or Linkin Park. As countless commentators have pointed out, they're by no means emo or hardcore--but they must be accepted for what they are, not run over for what they aren't. <br /> <br />From budding crushes gone wrong (\\"When I'm With You\\", \\"I'd Do Anything\\", \\"Addicted\\") to parental conflicts (\\"One Day\\" and \\"Perfect\\") and everything in between, Simple Plan definitely appeal to the youngest audience possible--or at least the youngest listeners can be when they start developing individual tastes in music. One look at the CD's cover seems to tell you what fantasies were swirling in these pop-punkers' minds, but one listen to the actual songs proves that not even early Blink 182's slapstick act can stand up to these guys. You simply can't tell them to act their ages. <br /> <br />But does this blueprint work when put into action? Past a few mediocre songs and vocals that can get annoying, ultimately, it does. Surprisingly, the track that best shows what these rockers are capable of isn't one that voices any tween frustrations, but rather a catchy one praising the singer's one-of-a-kind girlfriend: \\"My Alien\\", in which frontman Pierre Bouvier claims that \\"she has two arms to hold me / And four legs two wrap around me\\" over a catchy, munching guitar beat. <br /> <br />As a start their debut proves that they can not only produce memorable riffs and tunes that are perfect to sing along with, but its apt title proves that they can deliver energetic music without compromise, despite a theme that isn't nearly as perfected or as universally approved of as that of their peers.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig makes the other Bonds seem whimpy.  He may not be as \\"pretty\\" as the other Bonds, but he sure is the toughest and seemed more realistic. Finally, you see Bond get hurt and fall in love and have real feelings.  It was an awesome movie and I watch it over and over.  I've always enjoyed watching 007...now, I just love watching Casino Royale.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Got the new Rush this morning. I am extremely pleased (as usual). Rush is one of the most consistent bands in delvering quality music. They never rush things (excuse the pun) just to get new material out to make money. As for the new CD, it's not as hard or edgy as I was expect, but I think it really works. The instrumental \\"Hope\\" was mellow and very enjoyable. Nice arrangements and thoughtful lyrics make Snakes and Arrows another must for Rush fans.
B00005JPP6|4.0|From the brains behind Shawn of Dead, Hot Fuzz is, by turns, dazzlingly witty, frenetic, and surprisingly gruesome. You need to know that, because some people in the audience were shocked to see several people die in, well, clinical detail, shall we say. When the second half of the movie descended into all out war, many (myself included) were swept away by it. Others, unfortunately, staggered out of the theater a bit ... shell-shocked. Visually smart and filled with winks and homages to other films, this is a fat-free film. Everything's a set up, and everything has a pay-off. So pay attention class! (Okay, pay attention the second time you see it. There's enough gold to be mined that you'll be back.)
B000K7VHQE|4.0|\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is essentially a long set up for the very funny extended punch line that is its last five minutes.  The first two-thirds of the film is more dramatic than comedic, and drags in places.  However, when you get to the end, all of the character development that has taken place pays off in some fantastic comedy.  From an acting standpoint, \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is an actor's showcase, which probably explains its Oscar success.<br /><br />I have an idiosyncratic complaint that no one but me probably cares about: this movie is geographically challenged, to say the least.  First, the idea that the family could be near Scottsdale in the morning and make it to Redondo Beach by mid-afternoon (especially in that van) defies all belief.  Second, as a former resident of the beautiful city of Redondo Beach, the location of the beauty pageant at the end is actually a Holiday Inn in Ventura near the pier.  Would it have been so hard to reference Ventura in the script?<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is well-done, and is at least worth a rent.
B00004XPPK|4.0|Over the weekend, my interest in yet, another, classic film star sparked when I watched \\"Cover Girl\\" with Rita Hayworth.<br /><br />Then, later in the weekend, I watched \\"Gilda\\", which is a completely different kind of film.  IT's film noir, it's dramatic, it's a 1940's film starring one of the best actresses to come from that time, Rita Hayworth.  She stars, sings, dances, shimmies, and shakes like the earthquake she sings of in \\"Put the Blame on Mame.\\"  Rita was the ultimate package for Hollywood.  A Truly talented Redheaded dynamo..<br /><br />In the film, Gilda is married to an older man who runs a casino in Buenos Aires.  An ex-lover, played by Glenn Ford, comes back into the picture as her husbands' helping hands and eventually he is trying to use his own hands to help himself to Gilda.  Gilda is red hot and rearing to go with the first guy who will have her.  She yearns for attention, and thrives on the reaction she gets as well.<br /><br />Not the best well known of it's kind, this film noir is a fine film which turns out to be quite a great work thanks to the shining star called Rita Hayworth.<br /><br />Eileen F.

B000NVIXFK|3.0|I heard Farcry and was very excited for this release. It seemed like Rush had gone back to counterparts era and was ready to explode. After the first single though this cd starts to fall off greatly. The band who has always had songs about hope comes across as grumpy man who hate everything. Armor and sword never gets going and Faithless falls flat. The Larger bowel is awesome but lacks the cleaverness of Half off of Test for echo. Rush fans can be very spirited (LoL) about bad reviews but I just know there is another Counterparts or Test for Echo or Moving pictures in them but this is back to back bad cds. Still better than vapor trails so they got that going for them. As for the instrumentals nothing grabbed me like Limbo off Test.

044661758X|5.0|Very good story telling here and I have always admired Connelly's ability to develop characters and provide imagery to the reader.  In Concrete Blonde, you feel as though you're right in the middle of the action.<br /><br />The outcome in this one was totally unpredictable.
0761536434|5.0|This is a very in-depth and comprehensive look at the development and boom of video games from their beginnings in the 70's to the rise of Playstation in the 90's.  It focuses a lot on the stories of game creators and briefly hits on a lot of great games from all across the board.  It does a good job of giving behind the scenes stories of video companies and game desigeners.  If you want an interesting history of the personalities that shaped the video game industry this is it.  If you want more info about individual games, more pictures, and more focus, this book will probably wear you out or bore you.
B00005R62K|4.0|In the song Halford  sings about a king in stained glass.[\\"..and now he's just a stained glass king..\\"]He clearly enunciates \\"G\\".It doesn't make any sense otherwise.He's referring to the kings and queens that you see in English cathedral windows.Even the cover art shows a modernist stained glass window style.I'm sure that funny little owl like creature that you see in the artwork is in a famous stained glass cathedral window in perhaps Coventry Cathedral??That's around about where these guys were born.I suggest a listen and also read the lyrics.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Buy this, you will not regret it.  I also recommend Baraka, it's a similiar movie that also does some cool time lapse stuff.  Both are very moving.<br /><br />If you get the xbox hd-dvd add on drive, you can watch HD-DVD movies on your pc. It's worth it just for this series.
1582701709|1.0|It is hilarious and a bit sad that this book and video are taken so seriously.<br /><br />Touting a conspiracy that the rich and powerful and the religious mystics have kept this \\"secret\\" from the unwashed masses for millenia, our heroine Rhonda Byrne declares she is suddenly unleashing its miraculous power on the world. Replete with Da Vinci Code-esque graphics and anecdotal stories of magical results bestowed on practicioners, the crux is this: Think positive! Have positive thoughts and positive things will coming flying at you! Be positive! If it doesn't work, you're not thinking positive enough!<br /><br />This is essentially Norman Vincet Peale wrapped in Tony Robbins couched in Kenneth Copeland by way of Napoleon Hill masquerading as Dan Brown. All of which have been publicly available (with no monastic assassins guarding them) for your entire life at the used bookstore for 50 cents a pop.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|One of the best albums rush has put out in years. Great lyrics along with excellent production puts rush at the top again.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|A little pricey but very good quality and convenient. A calculator is invaluable when you cannot whip out a laptop and wait for it to boot, launch Excel or something similar, type in your numbers and formula, etc....  Nothing comes close to calculator in efficiency. Battery life is excellent.
0743298020|5.0|I'm not a Gothic fan, but this caught my attention. It's not fast paced, it's not life-or-death, but it is appealing. I'd have preferred a more concrete timeframe, and perhaps more on Margaret that didn't include her constantly bemoaning her fate as the surviving twin. She was a rich character at the end, but the change happened all through the story of Vida Winter. It wasn't her story, had little to do with her in fact. But it did change her. <br /> <br />Margaret Lea is to write the biography of a popular fiction writer who has told so many versions of her life story that no one knows the truth any longer. Vida Winter is a vibrant character, and her story is captivating. Her story is the attention getter to Margaret's lackluster life. <br /> <br />The ending was predictable, there were no surprised (and a dropped thread or 2) yet I looked forward to it only because I loved the story so much. This wasn't literary, as other reviews wished it to be - it was so much more interesting than that. Some of the depth of the story needed tweaking and deepening, but overall it was an engaging and noteworthy debut.
1591396190|4.0|A little dry compared to other books in this category. Even some strategy text books are more readable.
B000NDIAWO|1.0|Beyonce is everywhere, her record company invested millions of dolars to promote a single record around the world but it didn't sell like a superstar record, Why? because it isn't a good album. Everybody was waiting for better things from Beyonce, everybody but me. I Know she is a good singer but not as good as Mariah Carey, Toni Braxton and Whitney Houston. She is fine but vocally she isn't a star. If you are looking for a good RNB record buy Tamia's Between Friends and forget B'Day.
0316010669|5.0|One of the few books that I can read it more than once.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is considered to be one of the top 10 albums of all time by a large percentage of the world. Who am I to disagree? <br /> <br />Is it kind of weird at first for the new radiohead fan? yes. <br /> <br />Will it grow to be one of your favorite albums of all time? most likely. <br /> <br />If you like this album, check out Hail to the Thief.
0812975219|5.0|I would say that if you are in finance of any type, you definitely should read this book. Taleb makes some excellent insights about probability of outcomes in life. I gave it five stars because I think these insights make the whole book worthwhile, despite some shortcomings. The biggest in my view are his diatribes against certain people. He heard George Will once say something stupid and thus he regards Will as the epitome of the stupid journalist--and he refers to Will's 'stupidity' again and again. That goes well to show that even Taleb can draw very wrong conclusions from rare occurrences... But again: I highly recommend the book. Unlike some here, I thought it was a light read.
B000OVLNII|5.0|This rendering of Lincoln and his major cabinet members is superb. It is simply unbelievably good. If you thought highly of Lincoln before, you will think even more highly of him after this rendering of his story, from a very different angle. Yes, it turns out, there was something new to say about Lincoln. <br /> <br />I learned a lot about the men who contested him for the nomination and whom he then brought into his cabinet. I also learned what a master politician Lincoln was. How lucky this country was that he was there when we so needed him. <br /> <br />Most highly recommended.
B00005LK94|5.0|This movie is full of good performances, not least by the flock of Canada geese adopted by Anna Paquin's character, a young girl who's lost her mother and is forced to go live with her father, a man she hardly knows.  It's a splendid story, and shots of the geese flying alongside the ultralight flyer are inspiring.
B000I5X81K|4.0|The knocks on this album are completely misplaced. This is JG trying to expand his musical range and, unlike Closer, it's interesting and very listener friendly. Sure there is a lot of pop, even with a beat, good lord, how awful - not. Closer was a repeat of album #1, which was wonderful (I prefer the concert version but have both), with the same type of songs, except not as good or as interesting as the first set. It's so boring, I hardly ever listen to it and I love #1.  <br /> <br />Since getting Awake, I haven't taken it off my playlist. It is wonderful, musical, inventive and different for him. I highly recommend it. Two complaints are reason for 4 stars vs, 5: (1) the falsetto's. Forget it JG. Terrible way to use your voice. (2) leaving off the title song for extra purchase from iTunes. Unbelievably greedy and arrogant.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|First off, those of you looking for Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, or Signals era radio hits, don't expect such impossible once-in-a-lifetime heights.  This one is more geared towards those loving Hemispheres, Caress Of Steel and A Farewell To Kings.  This album is extremely musical... broad and sweeping, intimate and brooding.  Acoustic guitars and power chords abound.  This is old-school Rush with fresh top-notch production (best production since the departure of Terry Brown). <br />Like those early classic albums, \\"hit\\" singles are scarce.  Regardless, most Rush fans see hits as a nice surprise, not a neccessity for enjoying a great musical ride.  Snakes & Arrows delivers this in spades.  This is easily their best work in twenty odd years.  Very very impressive.
6304806418|5.0|Evita is a historically relevant musical about a woman named Evita Peron who, in the early twentieth century, rose to the top and became a significant influence to the people of Argentina.  She started her life out on the lowest ranks of society, an outcast in her own right, she slowly rose her way up to become a national figure in the political spectrum.  I thought it was a very well made movie with a great deal of historical accuracies incorporated into it.  Madonna was an excellent choice for casting.  This movie has an excellent entertainment value while also incorporating historical value into it!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I just purchased this CD a little over a week ago and I love it. Amy Lee's songs have such a haunting quality.. it's actually creepy, but I that's what I enjoy about it! Great CD.. I listen to it all of the time and I highly recommend it.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS NEW ALBUM OF DIANA'S.<br /><br />SHE SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS IN THE ROOM WITH US AND<br /><br />DOING A CONCERT JUST FOR US!!!
0143038419|5.0|I listened to half of this book on CD (read by the author) and read the other half.  I find that listening to Ms. Gilbert's voice and inflection is very helpful in fully grasping and appreciating this book.  I bought the book too.  I have given out several copies to date and plan to keep on giving them out.  There are so many wonderful messages within the personal story of Ms. Gilbert.  Buy it.  READ IT or LISTEN TO IT.  It is a beautifully moving and highly recomended.
1892065290|5.0|I read the review below by 'Apple' and felt the need to respond. Female characters in these novels are anything but whores, burly inn-maids and manly women. They are fierce, passionate and devoted characters with a drive and determination that often eclipses that of men. Examples follow:<br /><br />Catelyn Stark: A proud and honorable woman who has a commanding presence and a passionate heart. Even with her admirable traits, which are countless, you can't completely love her, for she holds a deep seeded hatred for her bastard step-child, Jon Snow, who is very undeserving of this.<br /><br />Queen Cersei: A cruel villian plotting to have her son on the throne, her manipulations are intelligent and evil, far beyond anything that a common bar whore could come up with.<br /><br />Sansa Stark: A prude at first who blossoms into the image of her mother and as of book four has yet to be deflowered, thus making her not a whore.<br /><br />Ayra Stark: A tomboy who looks like her father and later joins a mysterious guild. She holds a terrible grudge against so many people, reciting all of their names to inspire her every day. Also, not a whore.<br /><br />Lysa Arryn: Sister to Catelyn and slightly crazed, who sees the plot of the Lannisters, but isolates herself in her mountain home and coddles her sickly and bizarre son. Oh, and not a whore.<br /><br />Daenerys: A princess to a lost line of kings, who is regularly beaten into submission by her power hungry and insane brother and marries to bring him the crown (the result of which needs to be read, for her brother does get a crown, but not the one he hoped). She is perhaps one of the most powerful and enduring female charchters of all time. Also, not a whore, she is a Queen.<br /><br />All of these women are strong, intelligent and beautifully crafted characters who add nothing but depth to a wonderfully told story. This series takes a while because it's good. Other worlds release two books a year and those books are childish, good vs. evil cliches that never stick with you. These books have meat, and they are a joy to read. With HBO optioning to make a series of the novels and GRRM eagerly anticipating them, I don't see this series going unfinished. It will take time, but it will be finished. Do not rob yourself of the experience. He is a self made author, and I'd promote myself as much as possible if I could as well. He has done nothing more than show a love for his world and share it with his readers. I think 'Apple' is sadly unable to enjoy the quality before her.s are childish, good vs. evil cliches that never stick with you. These books have meat, and they are a joy to read.

B000E5KJE8|5.0|I love this movie when i seen it about 2 years ago, and now I bought it on HD DVD.  I must say, it looks awesome.  I recommend this move and just feel the realism of the movie!  The actings is superberb, from Denzel to Macy Gray! It was absolutely a great movie to see how things can be so over powered by the dark to light and light to dark.  In one hand you have a good cop trying be persuaded to be a corrupted cop, and the other hand you have a good cop that turn bad.  Its a great movie!  Very Good!
B00005JPFH|3.0|excellent effects, animation sequences, battle sequences (directing on those as well), but the rest so disappointing!<br /><br />i so loved the spidey while he was just a comic book character and animation possibilities we now witness were not even a dream! and what did they do with it? they all but KILLED spidey.<br /><br />they made him cry with toby's huge blue eyes, they made him act ridiculous under alien's influence, oh, they managed to make him quite pathetic a couple of times.<br /><br />aunt may, on the other hand, is just as boring and anal as i remember her in the comic books.<br /><br />james franco is always a joy to look at. thank god for him..<br /><br />and that's about it.<br /><br />my GOD, this movie is so bad.. its at least 30 minutes longer than it should be, at times it slows down to alost a HALT. romantic interludes way way too long and boring to kaboozas.<br /><br />i couldn't wait to get the heck out of the movie theatre.<br /><br />and i saw a few people leave half way thru the film on the OPENING NIGHT.<br /><br />if you can piss of the fans, that stands for something, doesn't it.. :(
B00008MZ0N|3.0|I agree with the Amazon reviews that said this was a guilty pleasure. While I wasn't interested in any way watching \\"hot women\\", the hot and fast action of high power muscle cars and street racing has some merit.  Pure enjoyment and knowledge that this is a movie, not reality. <br /> <br />Also... agreement with another reviewer - all my stars go to the racing sequences. They are heart pumping and great to watch.  While not Oscar material and not a movie to develop solid positive role models, definitely good to see if you're in that kind of mood.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Yeah I was lucky - I was tuned by an older cuz that into the sounds of the late 60's, lived by the beach and was too young to be conscripted for Vietnam. I grew up listening to blues with BB, Muddy, John Mayall, and Sonny and Brownie featuring on the turntable.  But the sounds of CSYN rang pretty pure through an impressionable Aussie lad.  Having listened to Neil and the crew like most people our age for nearly 40 years - I was moved to chills by this DVD and the etheral like qualities of pure Neil.  This was the future then and this now  is a beautiful piece of art/music history for the world to enjoy.  I am on your side Neil - Peace Hazza
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have been a fan of BBC's Pride & Prejudice for a couple of years, when I finally decided to give it a try and ended up fascinated and daydreaming about that beautifully told story and since then, nothing has been able to equal it, until today when I received my copy of North and South. I don't regularly writte reviews, but after seeing such a wonderful movie I had to do it. It took me about 3 months to convince myselt to buy this DVD, and now I know that I should have done it sooner. Great story, location, plotlines and a beatiful ending (better than in the novel). I dare say it's as good, if not BETTER than P&P. If you like P&P and are a little doubtful about buying this one, go ahead! You will love it!
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|I first heard the song \\"Woman\\" while playing Guitar Hero II on my Xbox 360 and instantly fell in love with it!  I'm a huge Led fan so this band's music and flair are right up my alley.  I really enjoy listening to bands that love their intruments and aren't afraid to use them to carry a record.  These guys can play with the best!  A must have for any classic rock fan.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I reviewed the first disc and liked it a lot. I also pointed out that the sophmore release is going to need something special if it's gonna continue in the same vein musically. Well, Ms. Carlile did it. T-Bone Burnet was an excellent choice for an excellent voice. Oh, and the songs continue to rock and to roll.     *****It's years later and my review was positive but not much of an insightful, quality one. Let's just say, although those reading this (I assume) already know this is a singer-songwriter record, it is also very well done. S-s is a basic style/genre of rock 'r' roll that, if not handled properly, can be boring. This is not due to the quality playing and songwriting. It's neither over-sensitive gentle nor too sloppy la-la-la. Come to think of it, it has an early (first 4 albums) Rod Stewart feel musically. And Brandi can sing beautifully and strongly.     Right on!  Get this(The) story, morning glory!
B00005JPFF|3.0|I saw this movie at an advanced screening and, although it is not a bad film, it doesn't live up to the standard set by Spider-Man 2.  They did it right in Spider-Man 2 by hiring Michael Chabon to co-write the script.  Based on the evidence of the other two films, he brought a much-need sensibility to the project.   <br /> <br />Part of the problem is that Spider-Man 3 is over-stuffed.  This is the same mistake that plagued the Batman sequels, as well as X-Men 3.  It tries to tell the Black Costume Saga, as well as the Venom Saga, as well as the Green Goblin II Saga, AND be a sequel to the previous two films (not to mention throwing in the Sandman too!).  Perhaps they thought that this would be the end of the franchise and they wanted to get everything out of the way.  The film opens with Peter Parker getting a swelled-head from all the acclaim Spider-Man is receiving and turning into a jerk.  All this seems very uncharacteristic of him and I spent the beginning of the film wondering if the symbiote had already attached itself.  When he does don the black costume, Peter Parker suddenly looks like Robert Smith from The Cure, and he REALLY becomes a jerk.  The worst scene in the film involves a musical/dance number that looks like it should have been in The Mask, not Spider-Man. <br /> <br />The result of all this is that not everything gets the attention it deserves.  Venom fans will be most disappointed in this film.  He should have had his own movie.  Instead, he is treated almost as an after-thought.  He is not true to the comic-book character and unfortunately, the filmmakers chose to have his face revert to Eddie Brock almost every time he speaks. <br /> <br />Supposedly, there will be three more Spider-Man films.  I don't know what the rest have in store - it feels as though they've exhausted their possibilities.  There are a lot of good things in this film - it is worth seeing.  Just don't get your hopes up too high.   <br />
0375831002|5.0|5 Stars is not enough...This wonderfully woven tale about a young girl's struggle to grasp, going as far as \\"thievery\\", in order to attain the true power of Words during a time that Words only belonged to an evil power and all others were silenced and burned into heaps of ashes. Liesel is my newest hero, although fictional, her Words cut deep as did Anne Frank's. <br /> <br />If you haven't heard it yet, then its a must...but beware because this book is not for the faint of heart...as only Liesel knows full well! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JPD0|1.0|This movie is very predictable and has a painfully unbelivable plot.  Nicolas Cages movie, called \\"Next\\", is a far far better time travel movie.  I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie.   I mean, who would believe that you could not only see backwards in time through an LCD screen TV but that you could also alter time through that screen?  I gave up on this movie 20 minutes into it.
0060776757|5.0|I love this book.  The pictures are great and it is a great asset to the coffee table.  Love it!
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I listen to this album A LOT! Enough said. I think Jr. Gong gets better and better with each album. It's really neat to see how he has matured as an artist. I think Stephen's production and vocal skills are also proven excellent. Much respect to Damian and Stephen, they continue make their own legacy of music.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is so great!  The charisma and positive energy that this movie generates are awesome!  How could it not be?  Gosling and McAdams were apparently smitten with eachother when they met because they got together after meeting on the set of this movie.  Talk about making the love scenes feel real...they were!  First rate romantic comedy material right there, folks.    Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams play the lead roles of Noah and Allie: two seemingly star crossed lovers torn apart by Allie's posh parents.  They think he is \\"trash\\" and thus not worthy of their daughter.  Noah works at a lumbar yard and is poor.  But his skills in carpentry and architecture will turn out to be worth more than gold!  Allie is sophisticated and popular; never at a lack for luxury or want of affections.  After an unforgettable summer of being together her parents decide to move and take a quite a trek too!  Can the two get past this unsurpassable cliff hanger that has unfolded before their very eyes, and if they do will their love not die?  Noah and Allie have no problem proving to other people that their love is true..but can they convince themselves of it?  Especially after such a long, agonizing separation?
0743496728|5.0|This was my first Picoult novel and I am impressed. Picoult had plenty of opportunities to make this a cliche story, but she took the less traveled and courageous path. This book leaves the reader wondering how many other kids like Peter are out there in America one step away from shooting up a school? What are we as a society doing to create villains out the same children who once harmlessly played with our kids in the sandbox? Who is to blame? After reading Nineteen Minutes, you will realize that there is no clear answer.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Despite what some other reviewers are saying, this may be Rush's best album in 25 years. Not only is it beautifully mastered (unlike Vapor Trails!), but the compositions are fresh and solid, the performances are intricate and impressive, the album is cohesive and tight throughout, and the whole work is brimming with nuance and an uncompromised spirit that isn't always found in their previous works. It all just feels wonderfully honest and fresh. This is a true gem, especially so late in their career!    **EDIT: 3 WEEKS LATER***  Ok, I'll admit I reviewed this album a little early, on the first day of release only after a few listens. It grabbed my attention so far past expectation that I couldn't resist. Three weeks later, however, my opinion hasn't changed, and this disc hasn't left my player.    Far removed from the ostentatious, showy presentations found in their other works, this album whirrs along gracefully from start to finish, with nearly perfect balance and posture throughout. Very little is out of place here: musicianship, solid songwriting, breathing space, elegant grace and form, nuance, superb sound, crisp production, contemporary aesthetic value - and last but not least, EMOTION. These are, quite frankly, some of the best songs they've ever written. I have never been so moved on such an innately human level by any other Rush album; they've simply never sounded so sublime. Rush really hit home with this record - a true classic in the making.

006085880X|3.0|A shot is fired on page 1, Emily Gold is dead and her boyfriend Chris seriously wounded. Jodi Piccoult's \\"The Pact\\" starts off compellingly, as the reader attempts to make sense of the tragedy. Was it murder or suicide? Was it a pact gone wrong? How could this happen to two perfect children?  <br /> <br />I'd heard that Piccoult tries to deal with real life issues in her novels, and she does a pretty good job in the first half of this book. How well do parents really know their kids? What goes on beneath the placid surface of upper middle class small town life? Unfortunately, Piccoult doesn't really explore the issue of teenage suicide in a serious way before the demands of the plot--how to get Chris out of the predicament he's in--take over. Like other reviewers, I found it hard to absolve Chris from some of the blame. In addition, the courtroom scenes come to a ludicrous conclusion--the lawyer in me rebelled at how totally impossible the end of the book would be in real life. I'd put this in the category of an airplane book at best--light,fast-paced and decently written but not to be taken seriously.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I thought this movie was very good by itself. It was touching and uplifting; it was technically flawless, what with the attention to detail; and the acting was on-key the entire time, from Will Smith and his son to Thandie Newton, the other supporting cast members and even the extras (the homeless were real homeless people!). The  DVD made me appreciate it even more.<br /><br />Among the special features on the DVD is \\"Making Pursuit...\\" where Will Smith and his co-producer talk about how they decided on the director, an Italian who can barely communicate in English! (Probably the crucial choice for the wonderful results.) There's a segment about how Jaden Christopher Syre Smith came to be cast in the movie, and another segment on Chris Gardner, on whose biography the movie was based.<br /><br />They even included a piece about all the interesting aspects of the Rubik's cube! (You've heard of people solving it blindfolded, but have you seen someone do it with just one hand?) Aside from the the usual director's commentary and previews, the DVD also has an audio-only track of \\"I Can,\\" a song by Bebe Winans and Dave Koz, which was inspired by the movie but not included in the theatrical release.<br /><br />I recommend this DVD as an inspirational gift, for someone else or even yourself.
B000O179A4|5.0|The hullabaloo over this film's NOT getting a Best Picture nomination overshadowed what is one of the best movie musicals I've seen in years. The story is familiar and fascinating--especially for those of us of Baby Boom vintage---and the all-star cast was wonderful. Eddie Murphy has to be the most versatile actor around; I couldn't believe it was he in the part of the fading R&B star. Newcomer Jennifer Hudson sings her heart out, and Beyonce` is drop dead gorgeous as well as credible in the Diana Ross role.  The music echoed the golden age of Motown and carried the story. The audience clapped--hard!--when it was over. Forget the press and see the movie--it's great!  <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|4.0|This film by Mel Gibson pictures the final 12 days of the life of our savior Jesus Christ. It's mostly in foreign language with subtitles. The torture of Christ is very gory. Two thumbs up!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|<br />  This series was absolutely amazing. If you saw it on tv, then you saw it in 720p, at best. Now, with Blue Ray, you can see it at a full 1080p, and believe me, you can notice a difference! The picture is absolutely flawless, the interactive menus are crystal clear and very easy to navigate, and the soundtrack that accompanies each shot is perfect. This series will win every award in the book.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I bought this DVD , cos as almost evey single person in the western world I watched this concert in MTV, so I WANTED , this show is plenty of good performances, I love DVD movies, concerts and whatever, actually I have 2 home teather at home (Philips and Sony) but this one it is special, the DTS sound it just simply WOW, they did a really nice job with the mix, so if you have this concert you must listen the DTS audio, for me it is the better audio that I ever heard in a DVD, Put simply it is a worthy buying
B000NA2776|5.0|Many adjectives spring to mind when listening to this incredible album .Original, flamboyant, unique and above all: delightful!!  <br /> <br />It's really interesting and rewarding to see how Mika is not only able to create top notch ear candy melodies, but he's also smart enough to throw into the mix darker elements. Love, lost, happiness and even tragedy are all subjects he deals with in this gem of an album conveyed in songs like Grace Kelly, my interpretation, any other world , relax (take it easy) just to name a few. <br /> <br />Sure, his music is reminiscent of great artists such as Freddy Mercury, Elton John and even the Beatles, but all artists are influenced by other artists, and in Mika's case, he happens to be influenced by none other than some of the biggest artists the pop world has ever seen or heard, and in my book; that can't be a bad thing by any means. <br /> <br />All in all, this Lebanon borne - London raised newcomer's debut is a fantastic and unique pop album, clearly made to his own vision and talent and one which will fill many a room with endless hours of fun and enjoyment, which when you think about it, it's the kind of effect only a truly great pop album can deliver, and to these wax free ears; it doesn't get any better than Mika's life in slow motion my friends... .Enough said!    <br /> <br />
B0000683DH|5.0|This one was the first Star Trek movie that I ever watched in 1986 when I was 7 years old... I REMEBER I LOVED IT, even more than Star Wars, the Enterprise it looks so cool, the uniforms, the story, the action, the special effects, but overall I never forget that I felt that those people are really friends, and I felt so sad when, well u know, after the sacrifice of one of the crew members<br /><br />In fact, I bought 2 copies of this movie, this one it is my favorite movie ever, and the special edition is plenty of really nice stuff, so, If you want to buy one of the better sci fi movie ever, you MUST BUY this one Star Trek movie, I know you will like it!!!!
1400063515|5.0|A fine antidote to gullibility - A Must Read!<br /><br />According to critic Harold Bloom, Hamlet's predicament is not \\"that he thinks too much\\" but rather that \\"he thinks too well,\\" being ultimately \\"unable to rest in illusions of any kind.\\" The same could be said for philosopher, essayist and trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who finds something rotten in misguided yet supremely confident investment gurus, traders, hedge fund managers, Wall Street bankers, M.B.A.s, CEOs, Nobel-winning economists and others who claim that they can predict the future and explain the past. Like everyone else, says Taleb, these so-called \\"experts\\" fail to appreciate \\"black swans\\": highly consequential but unlikely events that render predictions and standard explanations worse than worthless.<br /><br />Talebst book starts with this: Before 1697, teachers confidently taught European schoolchildren that all swans were white. They had little reason to think otherwise, since every swan ever examined had the same snowy plumage. But then Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh landed in Australia. Among the many unlikely creatures down under - odd, hopping marsupials called kangaroos, furry duck-billed platypuses, teddy bear-like koalas - Vlamingh found dark feathered birds that looked remarkably like swans. Black swans? Indeed. Once observed, they were as unmistakable as they had been unimaginable, and they forced Europeans to revise forever their concept of \\"swan.\\" In time, black swans came to seem ordinary.<br /><br />This pattern is common. Just because you haven't seen a black swan, doesn't mean that there are no black swans. Unlikely events seem impossible when they lie in the unknown or in the future. But after they happen, people assimilate them into their conception of the world. The extraordinary becomes ordinary, and \\"experts\\" such as policy pundits and market prognosticators kick themselves because they didn't predict the (now seemingly obvious) occurrence of the (then) unlikely event. Think of the advent of World Wars I and II, the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the popping of the 1990s Internet stock bubble, or world-changing inventions like the internal combustion engine, the personal computer and the Internet. Cultural fads like the Harry Potter books are the same. These events and inventions came out of nowhere, yet in hindsight they seem almost inevitable. Why?<br /><br />The human mind is wonderful at simplifying the onslaught of today's \\"booming, buzzing confusion\\" of data. This makes perfect sense: After all, the brain is the product of evolution, which works with what it has, and so it has not crafted some new, ideal cognitive mechanism. The human brain is a marvel, but it is built for living in hunter-gatherer groups on the African savannah 200,000 years ago. Then, it just needed to be good enough to allow humans to survive until they reached reproductive age. Simplifications, mental schemas, heuristics, biases, self-deception - these are not \\"bugs\\" in the cognitive system, but useful features that allow the human mind to concentrate on the task at hand and not get overwhelmed by a literally infinite amount of data. But human simplifying mechanisms are not without their costs. Take stories, for example.<br /><br />Stories help people remember and make sense of the past. Think of a typical business magazine profile of a successful businessman. The story begins in the present, after he has become rich beyond his wildest dreams. The story then cuts back to his humble beginnings. He started with nothing and wanted to get rich (in terms of story structure, his \\"dramatic need\\"). He faced obstacle after obstacle (perhaps he had a rival - the \\"antagonist\\"). But he made shrewd decisions and flouted the wisdom of the Cassandras who counseled caution (\\"Idiots!\\"). As success built on success, he amassed a fortune. He retired early, married a model and now has brilliant children who play Chopin blindfolded and will all attend Ivy League colleges. His virtues will be extolled in a B-School case study. Wide-eyed M.B.A. students will sit rapt at his feet when he visits their schools on a lecture tour promoting his latest book. He is a superman, an inspiration.<br /><br />Now consider an alternative hypothesis: He got lucky. His putative \\"virtues\\" had nothing to do with his success. He is, essentially, a lottery winner. The public looks at his life and concocts a story about how brilliant he was, when, in fact, he was merely at the right place at the right time. This is the \\"ludic fallacy\\" (ludus means game in Latin): People underestimate luck in life - though they ironically overestimate it in certain games of \\"chance.\\" Even the businessman himself falls victim to flawed thinking through the self-sampling bias. He looks at himself, a sample of one, and draws a sweeping conclusion, such as, \\"If I can do it, anyone can!\\" Notice that the same reasoning would apply had he merely bought a winning lottery ticket. \\"I'm a genius for picking 3293927! Those long odds didn't mean a darn thing. I mean, after all, I won didn't I!\\"<br /><br />Not all success is luck. In some professions, skill matters (for example, if you are a dentist), but luck dominates in others. In the case of the inspiring businessman, consider his population cohort. Where are all the similarly situated people who started out like him and have the same attributes? Are they also rich? Or homeless? Usually you can't find this sort of \\"silent\\" disconfirming evidence. Artistic success provides a perfect illustration. While Balzac is famous now, perhaps countless other equally talented writers were producing comparable work at the same time. Yet their writings are lost to posterity because they did not succeed. Their \\"failure\\" hides the evidence that would undercut Balzac's \\"success\\" as a uniquely great writer. The evidence is silent, lost in the graveyard of history.<br /><br />The mind uses many more simplifying schemas that can lead to error. Once people have theories, they seek confirming evidence; this is called \\"confirmation bias.\\" They fall victim to \\"epistemic arrogance,\\" becoming overconfident about their ideas and failing to account for randomness. To make their theories work, people \\"smooth out\\" the \\"jumps\\" in a time series or historical sequence, looking for and finding patterns that are not there. Their conceptual categories will limit what they see; this is called \\"tunneling.\\" They turn to \\"experts\\" for help, but often these expert opinions are no better - and often they are worse - than the \\"insights\\" gained from flipping a coin or hiring a trained chimp to throw darts at the stock listings. Worst of all, people steadily fail to consider \\"black swans,\\" the highly consequential rare events that drive history.<br /><br />Taleb's style is personal and literary, his heterodox insights are rigorous. This combination makes for a thrilling, disturbing, contentious and unforgettable book on chance and randomness.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Trully stunning cinematography.  Watching on my 36\\" Sony CRT in 1080i with a PS3 and the picture and colors are amazing.  I agree with someones earlier post that some of the fresh water episode was not as stunning but from what Iv'e seen the detail is amazing and the shots are superb.  I was even amazed wathing the avalance on the mountain episode.  I could see fine details in the rampaging snow.  And when they had it coming down the valley towards and envoping the cammera it was startling at the detail.  One of those moments you stop and say WOW.  As far as captuing animal behavior in their natural surroundings they do an exellent job.  I tried recording some of the episodes I missed on my DVR in standard definition and could not watch them after seeing how good it looked in HD.  It was like watching a color program in B & W.  So I erased them from my DVR and immediately preordered this set.  In my opinion I really like the case.  Relieved not to have a huge box set to have to make room for on my shelf.  It is the size more or less of a standard blu ray disk case.  And I have no problems with the discs falling out.
B00005JPD0|4.0|I'm a very big fan of Denzel Washington, who caused me to really appreciate his work and amazing presence watching \\"Glory and Training Day\\".  Unfortunately over the last 2-3 years, he really hasn't come out with anything I'd call worth more than a trip to the $1.00 rental store.  This movie really kept my interest and though some parts were rather cheesy, I actually found myself wanting more towards the end.  Though certainly not his very best work, it's for sure a sturdy bridge to his eventual mega hit in the near future (let's hope).  Check it out, I think you'll really like it.
1401302378|4.0|I think this book is a must read for start up companies.  I don't know if I'm drinking the cool-aid on this idea, but the book itself has many interesting points.  It's a very creative idea on how markets have changed, and ideas to be successful in the new economy.  Every chapter had a brief summary of what he was going to discuss, and then it went into examples on different areas where \\"The Long Tail\\" was.  I did feel the book was very repetitive as it is based around this one idea.  Bringing in real world examples, and input from companies who have been successful with this idea did make the book much more interesting and valuable.  I think the book would not have been as insightful without the data and insight from companies such as Netflix, Amazon, Google, and Rhapsody. <br /> <br />The idea of being able to have near unlimited choices, and how companies now don't need to hold inventory in store fronts because they can sell online I thought was very useful.  This concept brings together parts of the whole Web 2.0 phenomenon (see exhibit 2) as companies are starting to realize they can be successful on the internet.  I've read other articles that discuss the idea of \\"The Long Tail\\", and some feel there is potential to be successful if you have enough micro-niches to build up a big enough inventory to a attain sufficient volume.  This is really a book that gives people a fresh perspective on how the market has changed with increased choices.  I found a small article type on Nicholas Carr's blog back in 2005 that thinks if we unbundled cable, and let people choose the channels they want a la carte (a main idea of \\"The Long Tail\\"), that it may end up pushing more economic reward to the hits and squeeze out a lot of the choices since they can not be economically viable.  This is an interesting viewpoint but I don't think that mainstream cable or other forms of media will ever go away completely, and individual channels would be able to make it.     <br /> <br />Overall I think the book had some unique and interesting ideas, on how there is a growing niche market out there on the web, and there is a potential to be successful in it.  I thought the book was straight forward, and although the examples were good, they felt a little repetative.   <br />
B000M5AJQS|4.0|I read some of the negative reviews listed above and all I have to say is did we see the same movie?  This movie, once it gets going, kept my husband and I on the edge of our seats!  At times we both found ourselves holding our breath so long we thought we'd pass out.  Excellent performances by everyone.  I was expecially suprised by Leonardo's performance since in the past I never thought he was all that great.  I plan to purchase this CD, at full price if I have to, and believe me that's saying something.  Oh, if you're the type like me who hates the foul language, this one might not be the best, but I found I was able to get through it because it was written so well.
B000O178BY|5.0|Let me begin by saying this is not so much of a \\"technical\\" review of the sound of this disc.  No comparison of the disc to others Trent created.  Rather, this is a review based on a more emotive response to the work as (A)rt.  It may sound more like a treatise on What Is Art? but I really do view this disc beyond the realm of simply a collection of songs. <br /> <br />I have to be honest...intially I was not completely taken by the disc. The first 3 songs were NIN but the remainder varied. Capitol G, God Given and In This Twilight were the only ones beyond the 3 that I found appealing. Did I simply not get it? <br /> <br />The very premise that an artist produces art that a \\"fan\\" gravitates to implicitly is so false yet there are some who think art is an EitherOr condition. To this day I don't enjoy The Fragile in its totality. <br /> <br />Art finds it purpose in the subject...not in the artist. When art (B)ecomes for the subject it truly becomes real. The artist is like a frame in which the art can become fused: where does the artist end and the art begin? Is the frame part of the art? My point, it is possible to admire Trent so much that whatever he produces is to tied into (H)im that the art cannot stand on its own. <br /> <br />I am guilty of this from time to time. I found myself loathing me because I was not into the work simply because of my admiration of Trent as an artist. Why? Because the artist discloses a (R)eality that the subject cannot objectify...it is a moment of sharing. It is an intimacy and if the art is not found to be that gateway to (R)eality then there is a feeling as if the relationship is broken or harmed. <br /> <br />I have listed to YZ roughly a dozen times and I have come to accept something from it; something that elevates it as art. The fusion of lyrics to sound is critical. Allowing yourself, as subject, to become open to the emotions of the subject-matter creates a synchronicity. There is a pain to this work that is less narcisistic than Trent's past work. Rather than simply express disdain or anger there is a sense of dissapointment at potential lost. I get the work. I feel the work. <br /> <br />I can fully appreciate why one might not like the album...I was there. There is the condition that you simply don't like the \\"sound\\" or \\"noise\\"...I get that too. Maybe it isn't hard enough. Ok, valid point. What I think this art requires is a vulnerability from the subject. But again, maybe that is simply the blur of the artist and the art.
0060837551|5.0|Wonderful story, real characters.  Of the many, many thousands of books I've read in my lifetime, this one is right up there in the top ten.  McCullough writes from the heart and this book touched me deeply.  The author has no need to pander to the glands, as so many authors today seem to do.  Having also read \\"Lady Chatterly's Lover\\", this book is far superior in every aspect.  If a reader prefers trashy stuff, this is not the book to choose.  If, on the other hand, you're looking for depth and unforgettable characters, this is the book for you.
B000J103PC|4.0|In \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" Meryl Streep (her hair worn grey-white and cut short) beautifully underplays the boss from hell. She's the editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine \\"Runway.\\" She gives orders in a quiet tone of voice, and dismisses her underlings with a near-whispered \\"that's all.\\" At the start, we see several of the young women, who we'll meet shortly, dressing for work (to the sound of KT Tunstall's \\"Suddenly I See\\"), and hailing cabs to get there. All, that is, except for ingenue Anne Hathaway, who wants a job in journalism. She shows up (via subway) in the sort of getups she probably wore to her college special occasions to apply for the job of Streep's no. 2 assistant--having no idea who Streep is or, for that matter, much about fashion. Hathaway, a less-than-ugly Betty type, has a live-in boyfriend and hangs with a Boho crowd, and when she gets the job (much to the annoyance of Streep's number 1 assistant, played to a T by Emily Blunt), she starts out looking askance at the fashionistas (she giggles at two belts, each with a slightly different color blue)--and receives a lecture on fashionable colors from Streep.<br /><br />Streep, who announces her arrival each morning by tossing her coat on Hathaway's desk, wears her assistant down. In despair, Hathaway finally tells Streep's no. 2, Stanley Tucci, that she's at the end of her rope, and after a pep talk from him she realizes at last that what seems amusing to her is taken dead seriously by her colleagues. She starts dressing for the part, mostly in freebies acquired from the various samples sent to the magazine by designers hoping for a writeup.<br /><br />The movie is done well. Director David Frankel apparently knows more than a thing or two about pacing and timing. And he avoids cliches for the most part. There were scenes when I started to cringe, thinking oh, oh . . . here's where the thing turns into a sitcom you'd see on ABC on Thursday nights at 8:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, but Frankel doesn't let that happen. And if things go wobbly at the end (it would probably be too much to have expected an \\"All About Eve\\" finale in this era of focus groups), at least they don't go wrong.appen.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|All i can say is listen to this disc in your car at nite on a long drive and take in every single note and every single word like it was intended and you will see just what a great and layered piece of work this is! Rush just blew me away with this. They are by far my favorite band of all time, and they have shown all us fans that they are far from being bored with playing, and making music. I wasn't a big fan of Test for Echo, or Vapor Trails, but Snakes and Arrows reminds me of earlier Rush with more life, passion, drive, and intensity than i think i've ever seen from these guys. \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" is their best instrumental since YYZ, and dare i say, is somewhat more fun and cohesive. <br />I have listened to the disc about ten times now and it just keeps getting better and better. I keep hearing little details and nuances that i missed the time before. All in all it's just a very fun and very moving disc to listen to. GO BUY IT TODAY!!!
0553801503|5.0|This series has been a marvel to read. My only complaint about this volume is that I was looking for the inclusion of the whole cast of character, but I totally understand the decision to focus on one set. I can't wait for the next volume. <br /> <br />
B0000696I0|4.0|After the events of the first movie, the four mutant ninja turtles have temporary shelter at the apartment of April O'Neil (Paige Turco) until they can find the pefect home for them and their master Splinter (voiced by Kevin Clash). The Shredder still lives and has stolen a cannister of toxic chemicals from the chemical plant that made the ooze that served as the turtle's origins for he uses it to create two killer mutant animals of his own named Razarr and Tokkar as only the amazing four can stop them.<br /><br />Entertaining and action-packed sequel to the 1990 hit movie isn't quite as great as the original cult fave but still delivers action and humor even if it's kid friendly nor as dark as the original movie. Jim Henson's Creature Shop did it again with the creatures in this movie especially Tonkar and Razarr who maybe dumb looking but look realistic, David Warner and Vanilla Ice co-star especially with the song \\"Go Ninja Go Ninja Go\\".<br /><br />This DVD has clear picture and sound with both widescreen and fullscreen editions with only one extra which is the theatrical trailer.
B0000025L0|5.0|Widely considered one of the two essential jazz bass guitar records (the other being Jaco Pastorious' eponymous debut record, also released in 1976), \\"School Days\\" finds virtuoso Stanley Clarke providing a good indication of what he's made of.  Supported by a fine ensemble (usually Raymond Gomez on guitar, David Sancious on keys and either Gerry Brown or Steve Gadd on drums), Clarke creates a record that is very much a funk bass call to arms.  And certainly as a bassist, I find myself, even years after I've first heard this one, picking my jaw up off the ground (listening to the first 30 seconds of closer \\"Life is Just a Game\\" will do that to you). <br /> <br />One thing immediately noticable about the record is that it's startling diverse, sliding easily from loping funk (\\"School Days\\") to slithering synths (\\"Quiet Afternoon\\"), old school horn-driven funk jazz (\\"Life is Just a Game\\") and even a slice of acoustic calm in the midst of the storm (\\"Desert Song\\", featuring Clarke on an upright and guitarist John McLaughlin on acoustic guitar).  Throughout, the playing is top notch and it maintains itself as engaging. <br /> <br />One point I'd like to make-- this album is screaming for remastering.  The 1990 CD transfer just doesn't cut it.  But this aside, \\"School Days\\" is a classic, a great slice of funk-driven fusion jazz, and for anyone wanting to see blazing chops on a bass guitar, this is where to look.
B00005JLWN|1.0|There are an awful lot of well-known actors in this movie: Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson, Angus MacFadyen, William Fichtner..... *Sigh* What a Waste.<br /><br />The plot (such as it is) is that Bale, Bean, and Diggs are something-or-other `Clerics' in a futuristic world; their job is to slaughter anyone with feelings. Preposterous, especially since the movie is filled with them constantly saying things like \\"I think\\", \\"I want\\", etc - ALL EMOTIONS! Duh!<br /><br />Full of self-congratulatory flashy camera shots that are obviously trying to imitate The Matrix (Too bad Bale didn't play Neo, he can actually act AND he looks better in the black soutane) Would probably be bearable as a comic book - But as it is - I commend your strong stomach if you can sit through to the ridiculous end.

0375408266|5.0|I knew nothing about this book and thought the beginning was a beautifully told love story (illicit, but...still told in a very thought provoking, well written way).  Then it turned into a 'coming of age' novel.  Next it bacame a holocaust trial story and then became the protaganists moral fall from grace and descent into self hate.  Finally there comes redemption through the years of impersonal contact with Hanna.  Though a way to sooth his guilt over not speaking up at the trial, I found his attempt to mend the broken bridges of his and Hanna's life commendable.  I think this novel speaks to those Germans who had fathers in the SS and concentration camps.  It speaks from their point of view and their horrific guilt about the atrocities committed during their lifetime.  They have to live with it and they know they can never do enough to pay for the 'silence' of their relatives and ancestors. I did gasp at the end because it surprised me so (can't reveal this for potential readers)but the writer could not end it any other way.  A book that will leave you with many questions and new insights.  A book that I will remember.

Put yourself in a room and keep thinking that way and see if something will occur...nothing happening yet?  Alas, nothing comes out of just thoughts, it has to be applied with actions.

B00000IL26|5.0|Lee Morgan was one of the most gifted hard bop trumpeters of his or any generation since, and \\"The Sidewinder\\" has long been regarded as his magnum opus. The album's title track has become a significant jazz standard, with generations of budding artists since interpreting it both live and on record. This being one of the premium titles in Blue Note's long list of albums to date, Lee Morgan's \\"The Sidewinder\\" is one of the top-selling jazz albums of all time.<br /><br />Joe Henderson is admirably fantastic on this 1963 recording as is the legendary pianist Barry Harris, both of whom exhibit on here uncanny swinging improvisational backdrops and solos. Henderson underscores here how great an impact and influence John Coltrane was having on artists like himself by this point. But truly it is Lee Morgan, most of all, who stands out far and ahead of the pack on these tracks. \\"Totem Poll\\" is an absolute delight, opening to a wonderful piano-intro from Barry Harris with Lee stepping in shortly.<br /><br />This Rudy Van Gelder Edition comes with 24-bit remastering done by Rudy himself, and the sound quality and clarity is just right throughout.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|It seems that when a band only puts out a new album every 5 years or so, fans have much higher expectations.  After all, if the album sucks, you have to wait another 5 long years for another one...unlike the 70s and 80s, when you could count on a new Rush album every year or so, so you didn't have long to wait if you didn't like the most current one.  Plus, as they get older and older, you have to wonder how many more albums they will make...the arrival of a new Rush album these days is a treat, as I don't feel they really have anything left to prove.  They seem to be in the \\"I love doing this\\" mode.  We all know they are great, so why give them such a hard time if the album isn't Moving Pictures II?  Most popular doesn't always mean best.  Those kinds of things are usually based on individual nostalga rather than actual musical content. <br /> <br />That said, I don't think \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is a great album, but neither is it a bad one.  It's the typical Rush album - 3/4 of the songs are really good, and the other 1/4 are kind of okay.  They only have a few albums that I feel are truly great from start to finish (Permanent Waves, Power Windows, Moving Pictures & Vapor Trails fall into this category for me, personally).  And as usual, the album is definitely different from what they've done before.  Any Rush fan should know by now (even those who can't get past Moving Pictures) that they are masters at trying different styles and changing up their sound as the times change without completely alienating their fan base.  The fact that basically all their albums after MP have still gone Gold should be proof enough of that.  So the new elements on S&A (like the pervasive acoustic guitar throughout) shouldn't surprise anyone. <br /> <br />The only way I can describe S&A is that it's \\"mellow.\\"  It's very laid back compared to their previous works and the influences of the Feedback EP they did recently are very evident here.  The return to their 70s sound that the producer remarked on a while back refers more to that feel, I think, than the technical and 10 minute songs they used to do.  Only a few songs on this album have any urgency at all.  It's definitely different and upon the first few listens I wasn't impressed, but many of the songs are growing on me. <br /> <br />I'm not going to do a track by track review, but my favorites by far are <br /> <br />\\"Armor and Sword\\" - best lyrics on the album, lot of musical depth <br /> <br />\\"The Larger Bowl\\" - simple but meaningful lyrics with a good tune; if this had been released back in the 70s it would probably be a live staple such as \\"Closer to the Heart\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Main Monkey Business\\" - \\"YYZ\\" obviously is the definitive Rush instrumental, but I put this in a 2nd place tie with \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\" and \\"La Villa Strangiato\\"; it just has an awesome groove and should be good live <br /> <br />The album kind of dies out around the last 3 songs, which are the sketchy ones.  \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" seems like a complete afterthought and thrown on the album for fun.  \\"We Hold On\\" is my least favorite song on the album and not a very good song to end with...it just doesn't have the feeling that a closer like \\"Available Light\\" or \\"Vital Signs\\" has.  Only a handful of Rush albums have really good closing songs, in my opinion. <br /> <br />In the end, if you like any of their material from \\"Presto\\" forward, then you'll definitely like this.  There are gems on every Rush album, and they are all worth buying, even this one. <br />
B000O178BY|1.0|The problem with never studying any of the instruments you're mimiking on processors is the resemblance here on this album.  Everything is pushed together, almost to an irritating cyclicing, over-dramatization.  Music needs emotion in order to do anything at all.
1400063515|5.0|2007 is only 1/3 done, but the year's best business book is already clear. Taleb's book is about black swans---highly improbable events that have a big impact on the world. Think 9/11, the East Asian crash of 1997, or the collapse of the Soviet Empire. Taleb's claim is that there are so many potential black swans that even though each one is very improbable, one or another hits on a regular basis. We are blind to the black swans ahead of time because each is unlikely. More importantly we are blind after the fact because we learn about the details of the black swan that actually hit rather than thinking about all the thousands that could have hit and did not.  <br /> <br />Taleb is a scholar and an iconoclast, skewering many sacred cows while explaining his claims and backing up his ideas. Plus this book is a lot of  fun to read.
B00009W0U4|4.0|\\"Irreversible\\" is like no other.  I was lucky enough to originally see this film on a large cinema screen as part of the \\"French Film Festival\\" in the year of it's original release.   I didn't know much about it, other than the rumour that it contained a fairly vicious rape scene. That it did.  Five minutes in, it has some other stuff as well that took me completely by surprise and jolted me to attention. I've seen my share of sick stuff, but this was something totally new.  \\"Irreversible\\" is incredibly brutal and nasty, with some amazing performances from the cast involved.   Definately not for the kiddies, or even some adults. In fact, even most adults. It's a tough watch.
0316010669|3.0|The first chapter was enthralling. It tells us how a number of art experts, using the latest available scientific techniques, failed to spot a fake whereas a few other experts, believing in their gut reactions spotted the piece of art work as a fake. Great start.  <br /> <br />But then the obvious question arose. We all know how our gut reactions, our instincts or 6th sense, call it whatever you might, have failed us in the past. How does one tell the real McCoy from the fake one? I was hoping that the book could help answer that question. It didn't. <br /> <br />So what does it make this book? An entertaining read. That's all. It really hasn't changed my decision making process in life, and I doubt it will change anybody's decision making process in their lives either.
B0002CHIJW|4.0|\\"Spit\\" is one of my all time favourite little \\"nasties\\".  It's sick alright and still very disturbing, even though it was made way back in 1978. Ok, it's low, low budget, but that's why it works.   The film's lack of music throughout makes it all the more off putting.  Camille Keaton, as the victim, is an absolute trouper.  Rodney, is Gold.    This Millennium Edition of \\"Spit\\" is something my brother and I used to joke about. Ever since we first caught \\"Spit\\" at the Drive In on it's original release, the idea of a special edition of \\"Spit\\" was something we only ever dreamt of one day owning.   To have it like this, THX Certified Transfer, Dolby Digital/DTS 5.1, looking and sounding like it was made yesterday, with extras laid on, you've got to be kidding.   And that cover ain't half bad either....hey?       Warning:Definately not for the kiddies.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Rating: 3.5 stars <br /> <br />I am a huge Rush fan and have enjoyed all of their albums to one degree or another.  While S&A is not the best of their releases, it is a decent album and is worth the purchase. <br /> <br />WARNING!  It may take a number of times though for it to grow on you. <br /> <br />Note: I delete my previous review because it was overly harsh on the album.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|You can't deny the very dark theme of the album. Obviously, Neil's goal is to communicate his view and frustration with the state of the world today. His message could have been more positive, but he chose to tell it how it is rather than how it should be, how we want it to be.  <br /> <br />The dark theme aside, the music, as usual, is a major shift in direction for the band. The songs have structure, but it's not immediately clear. Like most of Rush's albums, you simply cannot judge this album after one listen, or even three listens for that matter. You really have to keep the album in constant rotation or keep coming back to it before it finally starts to unfold. <br /> <br />I'm still in the early listening stages, and there are moments I question or don't quite agree with, but I keep going back for more and find most of the time I'm amazed and surprised by what I'm hearing.
0316096199|4.0|I had read the lovely bones and loved it. I was not as impressed with this book but i still liked it. My only problem was the first half was fairly boring. It took untill half way through for me to not beable to put it down.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Nowadays, emo is considered anything that involves dudes in eyeliner and tight pants \\"crying and screaming\\". That describes MCR's last 2 albums. The Black Parade on the other hand, is a resurrection of epic rock. They took things to a whole new level by bringing in a whole new story, (Hence The Patient, Mother War) an orchestra, and LIZA MINELLI! This album is amazing and once you hear it from beginning to end, you're gonna wonder what happened to those guys that wore black and red all the time. And the lyrics alone will make you see why they should no longer carry the EMO label. Here are my favorite tracks:    This is How I Disappear  Welcome to the Black Parade  House of Wolves  Mama  Sleep   Disenchanted   Famous Last Words
006085880X|5.0|I am an 18 year old college student. I love to read. This book is probably my favorite one ever. I don't think ive ever cried so much in my life, but it was still amazing. I literally could not put it down. I look foward to reading more books by this author!
0061015725|2.0|The story was pacy and it was thrilling in parts. However, it became very predictable and I could easily stay a step ahead of the story without even trying much. I was disappointed.
0743496728|3.0|Nineteen Minutes is overall a very good novel, but not a great one.  The overall plot is very intriguing and intense, but I think she goes overboard.  The way Picoult describes the \\"popular\\" and \\"non-popular\\" crowds are very stereotyped and unrealistic.  When I was in high school, never in my life did I see anyone in the \\"popular\\" crowd treat anyone in the \\"non-popular\\" crowd the way depicted in this book.  Further more, if that did ever happen, in real life, the reaction from teachers would be much different.  Also, when the character Josie (one of the popular kids) says that no one in the popular crowd is even really friends with each other is yet another exaggeration by Picoult.  Again, not true to real life.  This is just one of the many unrealistic and over dramatized areas of fault in this book.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Sorry to burst the bubble of the people who are panning this album (not many from what I saw), but it is brilliant. The relatively melodic music meshes well with the lyrical theme of religion and spirituality. How can anyone fault them for that? Thank you, Rush. If this turns out to be your swan song, I am forever indebted to you for enriching my life so much.
6305882592|5.0|The first time I saw Harald and Maude was 20 years ago. It blew me away. At the time it was not possible to buy the film. Since then it has been released on DVD and VHS and I immediately bought it. Watching it again was just as fantastic. This is a beautiful love story and so very uplifting. So many topics are filmed over and over. Harald and Maude is one of a kind and the only movie of its kind. I highly recommend getting this movie. It is one of those films you can see again and again.
B000O178BY|3.0|Where to begin.    Lets start with `With teeth'. WT defiantly was lacking right from the get go.  The industrial element was faint, and the ferocious progressive component that in my opinion has defined NIN in the past, was nowhere to be found (i.e.Terrible lie, that's what I get, Gave up, mr self destruct, heresy, ruiner, the becoming. reptile, somewhat damaged, no you don't, &  the big comedown are arguably some NIN's best in this category).  In retrospect, WT was the most commercial rock-n-roll album that NIN dangled in front of my drooling ravenous face that really just left a bad taste in my mouth.  Despite this sad delivery, I supported and swallowed the record since I believed that a less compelling album from NIN is still better than 90% [...]that's out there now.      what does this say about year zero?  Well two wrongs don't make a right.  If with teeth was a typical rock-n-roll album that marked the complete opposite of the nail's industrial signature, then year zero went too far to achieve the absolute contrary.  At times it's simply too noisy to the point where it's just unwarranted and undesirable.  Every single song seems to begin with the exact same loopy drum beat, and any decent guitar, or distinct sound effect that could give the song any kind of possible substance can barely breath underneath the overwhelming, drowning, out-of-place noise. No real build up to any song. In a weird way this sounds like a b-list remix album that was intended as half-a** halo to tide us over until the real thing is finalized to perfection.  One of my favorite things about the pre-WT era was the balance that NIN would achieve with the tactful placement of noise in what would otherwise be a trivial rock song and transforming it into an industrial masterpiece of fury. This era seems to no longer exist.  But only because it's The Nails, do I condone the utter lack of creativity that has transpired into what could very well be a complete let down.     With all this said Ido believe that it is probably too early to really bash the album since music can take many months to grow on you.  I distinctly remember being very disappointed with 'lateralus' when it first came out truly believing that Tool finally lost their charm.  It wasn't till many months of careful analysis of the album that I realized that it is indeed their undisputed masterpiece.  Though I don't see this type of a result surfacing in YZ, I do believe that the album has potential and will give off a different feel once it has had time to nest itself in the listening rotation.     I will also mention that I don't want to steer people away from this album by any means, for this is a must-have for any true NIN fan and I do believe that everybody in essence is their own critic in the end, and only when you listen for your self will you actualize your own true thoughts about this piece of work.  Let us hope that we can still get something out of Year Zero.
B00005JPCF|1.0|How do I put it? This is one of the worst animated cgi productions I have seen in a long time. When even my kids hate it, they out did themselves. Carlos and Lombardo got paid to make this? Hope it is their last because it had no story line and very poor writing and boring from the start. We had to keep skipping to try to find something funny or interesting but never did find it. The ending was no surprise and was overplayed. <br />Just don't bother with this movie, a old TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) cartoon is much better to watch. OH, I gave it away the next day to someone I did not like.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|It's surprising the negative responses that claim this CD isn't any different than [insert least favorite CD here].  Neil had described the work as \\"organic\\" when he was listening to it taking shape and it wasn't apparent until I heard this.  I'd probably use that word to describe the relationship between music and lyrics that seems very different this CD. <br /> <br />Usually I've always felt that the music and lyrics complemented each other perfectly, it a very structured and semi-predictable way.  Even when the band is playing odd time signatures and dancing all over the fretboard and drumkit the lyrics still seem confined to a predictable structure.  This is not the case with this CD. <br /> <br />Another reviewer commented that the songs sounded disjuncted and \\"randomized\\" together and I wouldn't say that's completely inaccurate.  I'll be the first to admit I'm not the most objective having been a fan since Permanent Waves and enjoying almost everything they've put out other than Roll the Bones and Presto.  The rhyming doesn't seem to be as much a concern for Neil as it was in the past or there isn't as much work in rewrites.  All that being said, there's plenty of music out there with lyrics that don't rhyme at all (Pearl Jam for instance) and it's still great stuff. <br /> <br />There are some songs where it does sound forced, vocal melodies jammed together with lyrics simply because they had nowhere else to go I assume.  There are some songs on this CD I just can't make it through -- The Larger Bowl, Spindrift -- because of this very problem.   <br /> <br />But I LOVE the guitar sound on this CD.  It doesn't suffer from Alex's \\"less is more\\" phase (Presto, Roll the Bones) and doesn't suffer the \\"more is more\\" phase (Hold Your Fire).  It's BIG, it's LOUD, it's tasty, meaty, layered, effectified, and probably Alex's best guitar sound since 2112 or Hemispheres.  However, if you're looking for tasty licks and blazing solos this is not the CD to find them on.  Sure, there's some sweet bluesy licks and huge panning volume swells but nothing noteworthy in the solo department.  Even the instrumentals. <br /> <br />I'd also add that the bass and drums sound good.  Not great.  Not that Rickenbacker crunch or the Steinberger pop or even the Wal [fill in a word for that sound].  It's ok, even tasty at times (Malignant Narcissism) but I'm getting the feeling these days that Geddy is spending more time layering his vocals and concentrating there then on his playing.  Personally I'm disappointed since I whine for his playing constantly and wish he could hit those notes of his youth, but it's not awful. <br /> <br />The drums sound plain at times.  Yes, I will sound like a \\"old Rush\\" fan when I say things like how I miss Neil's hi-hat out of nowhere on the backbeat things he would do. They do make a slight appearance on Good News First but very very slightly.  It's still solid drumming IMHO, but the \\"sound\\" of the drums doesn't seem as brilliant or impact-oriented as even Vapor Trails.  I'm left to wonder what happened there. <br /> <br />So after all that why 4 stars?  It's not because I'm a fan, honest.  I really didn't like Vapor Trails that much and said so.  I think some of their albums just sucked (Presto and Roll the Bones).  I admit, I have a weakness for guitar and this one just sounds guitariffic.  That has a lot to do with it.  But lyricially I like it.  Even if I don't think the lyrics fit the song as well as previous works, so what?  It's different.  I've been in a rut with Rush these days, thinking \\"Man, I'm tired of Rush...I guess I'll pop in some more SB or Porcupine Tree, etc\\" but this CD was different enough that I could say \\"Wow, this sounds different enough that I don't feel like I'm listening to the same old Rush\\" and yet it still has the odd time signatures and though provoking lyrics prog rock is supposed to be all about. <br /> <br />Best songs: Armor and Sword, Workin' Them Angels, Malignant Narcissism
B000NVIXFK|4.0|No long meandering review here. I've been a fan since Farewell to kings, lost them a bit in the late 80's and parts of the 90's but recently returned to the fold.<br /><br />This is their best in a long time, very reminiscent of some of their older stuff with the welcome return of the acoustic guitar, but with an overall sound that's very much in the 2000's.<br /><br />Lifeson's best work in a long time, and, like the band themselves now in their 50's, a very \\"mature\\" approach in the songs and music, but it still rocks for the most part.<br /><br />Peart's lyrics appear to be the putcome of his observations from his recent journeys, and perhaps some coming-to-terms with his own personal pain.<br /><br />No, it's not \\"Moving Pictures\\", most artists only get one of those serendipitous moments in their careers, it doesn't mean everything else is bad though, and this definitely isn't in the same league as Moving Pictures, but it IS bloody good
B00000272N|5.0|Four young men from Seattle were in the music business to take over the airwaves with their metal-grunge style and sound. They sold millions upon millions of records in their illustrious career, and it began with a debut full of hard metal blues, a little boogie, and impassioned performances. This young band was known as Alice In Chains and the debut album I'm speaking about is the maelstrom known as FACELIFT. Brimming with enough angst to kick a cow from here to Timbuktu, FACELIFT was heavy on metal and classic rock styles, with an undercurrent of grunge lying underneath it all. Honestly, this is the heaviest album next to DIRT that Alice In Chains ever made.     There are two main ingredients here that make this album sizzle hotter than a firecracker on the 4th of July: Layne Staley's unbelievably amazing and caterwaul vocal performance, and Jerry Cantrell's powerful metal riffs and rip-roaring solos. But, you cannot count out the great rhythm section of bassist Mike Starr and drummer Sean Kinney, who hold their own ever so capably underneath the two stalwarts and they are important pieces themselves.     \\"We Die Young\\" is a short burst of aggro-grunge that fires at you at 100 miles per hour, with Cantrell's razor-sharp riffing and Layne Staley's menacing voice growling lines like \\"scary's on the wall/scary's on his way/watch where you spit/i'd advise you wait until it's over\\". It brims full of anger yet the chorus shines and pummels at your face. Then \\"Man In The Box\\" rips open the door with it's heavier-than-thou grunge riff and Staley's stated scream of \\"Feed my eyes!\\". It became a staple on radio thanks to it's catchy rhythm and stellar musicianship, and one hell of a solo by Jerry Cantrell. \\"Sea of Sorrow\\" is damn near classic itself, featuring a great chorus between Staley and Cantrell, and yet another great solo by Cantrell, with Kinney and Starr keeping steady pace. Then we dip into the creepy crawl of \\"Bleed The Freak\\", again with Staley turning in another great vocal turn, and even the slightly melodic \\"I Can't Remember\\" thunders and growls with a quiet intensity lying underneath. Then comes a track like \\"Love, Hate, Love\\", which is a chilling tale over Staley's lamenting and musing about doing a horrible thing to his lover, all the while Cantrell shines one of his best solos on the album, and Staley turns in probably the most gut-wrenching vocal performance on the album, especially when he growls in a terrifying scream \\"Love! Hate! Love!\\" The chugging dinosaur riffs of \\"It Ain't Like That\\" hammer home with a precision of a clock. Then things start to get a little jangly with the boogie-metal of \\"Put You Down\\" and \\"I Know Somethin' (Bout You)\\", both of which are very damn catchy numbers. It all comes to a close with \\"Real Thing\\", which ends the album on a bluesy note, and a crashing finale featuring Layne coughing, most likely for show and not for real.     So after you listen all the way through FACELIFT's 12 tracks, you'll find yourself recovering like a boy who's recovering from a swift and hard punch. That's how I can describe FACELIFT...it's more like a good punch in the face that will leave a little blood in its aftermath yet shines on because it's determined to leave a lasting impression on you. And by all accounts, FACELIFT leaves a big impression from it's stormy brew of grunge metallic, alternative darkness.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Rush has always been a \\"total experience\\" for me--the layered music, the depth of the lyrics (I still find new meanings in 25 year old songs!), the art, the thematic ties, the live Rush (!), and the technology.  I am truly impressed by the total Rush assault of the senses on this one, right down to the incredible additions to the website on release day.  Bravo!
B00005BKZJ|5.0|Right from the start you know this something special. Odd camera angles and a couple in a U.S desert speaking German. The man leaves the woman and she walks until she finds a cafe run by a black lady at which she can stay. Thats basically the plot up to the opening credits - I've given absolutely nothing away.<br /><br />How the film develops from there and the way the characters are interwoven is wonderful. All the actors and actresses give amazing performances including an ageing Jack Palance whose Mr Cox is a real oddball.<br /><br />The film certainly wasn't a huge commercial success, but commercial success has nothing to with quality. Its difficult to make comparisons with other films because this is a one of a kind, but it has something for everybody. It shouldn't work - but it does!
B0002946M2|4.0|I got this shoe a few days ago, and these are my initial impressions <br /> <br />This is an amazing footwear product. It combines the ventilation and feel of a sandal, with the toe protection, and hiking ability of a solid shoe. It is quite amazing! <br />Furthermore, the only thing one needs to do to adjust the fit is pull and elastic cord. Its so easy. <br /> <br />Overall the shoe is very comfortable, with one exception. The strap that goes around the heel has chaffed the skin above my heel from the rubbing. I have never heard anyone else complain about this, so maybe I'm just an exception. I don't know.  <br />Another quirk is that the shoe is labelled as waterproof. I fail to see how this is the case, since the leather does absorb water and takes a long time to dry. And obviously the shoe itself is not impervious to water since it has all the holes. So, definitely not waterproof in the traditional sense. Maybe they mean that the leather can withstand water. I'm just not sure what to make of this claim. <br />Third quirk is that the metatarsal ridges that are supposed to define where the toes go. Instead of being in the space between the foot and toes, the ridges rest in the middle of the toes, which causes an uncomfortable feeling for a while. I have heard this from others, so I know I'm not the only one here. Its strange that Keen would develop such an amazing shoe and then put the metatarsal ridges too far forward. <br /> <br />Overall, a very versatile shoe. You can run, hike, walk, or use it as a house shoe. Quite amazing. <br />I heartily recommend this product.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|This is a must have for any Rush fan. I bought this album on the way back from a business trip and listened to it for about 3 hours. There are so many nuances and twists and turns that it takes several spins to wrap your head around it. In my humble opinion this is one of the best albums produced in the past 30 years. The music is seamless and flows from the disc into your brain and makes you crave another listen. As a music producer I could only hope to accomplish something of this caliber.  <br />Personally, I would rather wait 5 or 6 years between albums and hear something like this than all the garbage bands that crank out 2 or 3 albums a year.
B000O174CM|5.0|Wow, this was a great movie. I mean, when I went to see it. I thought that I wasn't going to like it. But trust me, you will like this film. The music was just fantastic!!! Jennifer Husdon just stole the show. Eddie Murphy, Beyonce and Jamie Foxx were in fine form too. But, it was Jennifer Husdon who dominated this film. A truly great movie.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Well I can't wait for it to come to Blu-ray! <br /> <br />For the other poster: did you see in what section you're in? It's a release in Hi definition! And GL only said, he would never release the original versions of the sequels again. So most likely we will see the new special editions of IV, V and VI. So until it actually gets realeased, hold your horses before jumping to conclusions, waisting everybodies time...
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is such a valuable piece and really should be seen by anyone who intends living more than the next few years or who cares at all for children and others who will.<br /><br />It's not just inconvenient but for any of the `developed' world who have a conscience or concept of morality it is uncomfortable, downright prickly even!<br /><br />Do things like the Gulf War really matter if we could all be living in desperate drought conditions except for the few in conditions like after Hurricanes Katrina or the Boxing Day Tsunami in the not too distant future?  An inconvenient truth is factual and based on the rigours of scientific testing, not the sensational small minded media hype and illusion used to anesthetize people, so they don't notice or care about real issues, in fact so they won't care about the real or important issues.<br /><br />If we don't finally succeed in making humanity extinct soon, will future generations hate us and treat our history with absolute contempt, resenting us as ignorant pigs? Are we knowingly condemning them to horrors because we thought we could be trusted to have sensible values, make sensible decisions, install Governments that would share our views and then make sure those Governments supported those values?<br /><br />If we don't actively all meet our responsibility to personally do what we can and pressure the Administrations to do the same on our behalves we are guilty and deserve the inevitable, sadly any future generations will only be guilty of being born to irresponsible, apathetic, short sighted, self centred people-Us!!<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Lloyd
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Okay, hands down...this guy is just SMOOTH!  His last cd was really good, especially his self-penned single, \\"Home\\".  Again Michael Buble delivers his Sinatraesque version of music to a new audience but putting more of himself in each cd.  (So I guess we should say this cd is more Bublesque!)<br /><br />The first single released from the new cd, \\"Everything\\", for some reason reminds me of a Norah Jones song.  Its a good single to lead off this new set of songs.  Buble does great versions of \\"I'm Your Man\\" and \\"Comin'Home Baby\\" with guest vocalists, Boyz II Men.  His cover of Willie Nelson's \\"Always On My Mind\\" is simple and pure and one of the gems in this new set.  \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" is really good as well (if you can't forget his dreadful performance a few weeks ago on American Idol, which Buble chalked up to a case of nerves).  He also continues to give us some nice Latin tinged music with \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\".<br /><br />Buble is the crooner of this generation.  Well worth adding to a real music lovers cd collection.  Highly recommended!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is, without any shadow of a doubt, one of the best films ever made.   <br />George Bailey (played by the wonderful Jimmy Stewart) is a depressed man who contemplating ending his life because he thinks he's worthless.  Enter Clarance, a guardian angel despirate to earn his wings from God, who begins to show him differently.  The story of how one persons life affects so many others is both inspiring and heartwarming.  It really does make you think just what might have happened if you hadn't been in a certain place at a certain time.  For the few of you out there who haven't seen it, I won't spoil the ending, save to say that it's as brilliant as the rest of the film.  The film should have won every Oscar going but, sadly, it didn't.  This film really is a true classic.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|OK folks...I'll try not to write a long review because of the positive comments posted so far.  But personally, it is hard for me to compare this new CD with the previous ones as each stands on its own merit.  Back to this one... <br /> <br />The kickoff tune is \\"The Best is Yet to Come.\\"  Too bad this is the only track featuring the killer-bee Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, but it sets the tone for the entire album.  I have my favorites - namely \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" (with Boyz II Men providing tight harmonies), \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\" (one of my favorites from the Philly soul era) which Mr. B. puts his own stamp on (that's Emily Blunt's voice you hear as the song fades out), the title song (with a knockout Bill Holman chart), and so on.     <br /> <br />PLEASE do not call Michael Buble just another \\"lounge lizard\\" (I hate that label)! He surrounds himself with the very best to make an album like this sound so great...go check him out when he tours in your area!!!
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I gave this album a low review because it didn't meet my expectations...it was far at the time but now I'm reconsidering it.    Snakes and Arrows is a serious departure for Rush, one that may launch a new phase for \\"the boys\\"    Several of songs have very loose instrumentals that lead me to think that Rush may be changing the way they handle live performances.  We're used to Rush being a band who slavishly attempts to recreate the studio sound live.    Snakes and Arrows has a different sound, one where the instrumental breaks are pretty unstructured.  By that I mean guitar solos are sparse with Geddy and Neil largely driving the action.  Listen to \\"Fry Cry\\" for a perfect example of what I am talking about.  Alex lets the guitars open up more on the instrumentals but even they have a different quality to them.    Dare I say, a \\"jam\\" quality.    If this is the path that Rush is taking it's a bold gambit but one I'm willing to support.  With their rich back catalog, there are dozens of songs that are open to reinterpretation and for the fans that stick with it then it will be a fascinating experience.    And if I'm right then Snakes and Arrows wasn't a disappointment.   It is a master stroke that let a 40 year old band redefine itself in a flash with a jam band album.                             OLD REVIEW:  in creating boring, self-derivative music.    I have ben listening to Rush since Moving Pictures and have enjoyed the bands evolution as they incorporated various musical styles into their own.    My love of the band's music has been tested in recent years as the band churned out more AOR friendly tracks- for every \\"Driven\\" there was a \\"Time and Motion\\" or \\"Speed of Love\\"- songs that felt like filler or worse, songs that felt like they were generated by a \\"random Rush song\\" program.    That trend was broken somewhat by the band's most recent original studio effort, Vapor Trails in which the boys really cranked things up and out out an interesting album full of hooks, drive and creativity.    Snakes and Arrows was said to be a return to roots with song constructions and guitar tones reminiscent of the band's art-rock years of [roughly] 1977-1980.    Based on my opinion of Vapor Trails and the anticipation of a return to a very creative, dynamic sound I had high hopes for Snakes and Arrows.    \\"Far Cry\\", the album's opening track, should have served as a warning.  The opening did sound as if it was lifted from a studio session from Hemispheres, but soon devolved into the formulaic Rush sound- in this case the song sounded like a Counterparts outtake.    The experience of listening to Snakes and Arrows quickly went downhill after that.  After listening to the first four tracks I realized I had the \\"Son of Test For Echo\\" in my CD player.    Three general observations about the album:  1) Where are the hooks?  Nothing grabbed me like the bridge of \\"The Trees\\" or opening riff of \\"Secret Touch\\".     2) The songs plod along with no tricky changes in tempo or time signature.  There are songs like \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" where the band mixes up tempo and dynamics a bit but it ends up sounding like the AOR formula Rush- rock a little, then let off and go acoustic- you know, like in \\"Nobody's Hero\\".    Sad that now when the band has 70+ minutes to work with instead of the 40 minutes afforded by vinyl they produce a bunch of samey-feeling four to six minute songs instead of a twenty minute opus where they can really develop some ideas.      3) Some of the lyrics are almost embarrassingly earnest.  I won't quote them out of context [that's unfair] but you'd know them if heard them.  Neil Peart has always been capable of writing some groaners but I could often ignore them because the music carried the song.  That's not the case on this record.    If I thought Rush was mailing it in, I would have given this one star but I've never doubted the effort or talent of the band.  This album just didn't click and the results are very disappointingbased on the hype, which had me thinking it was a \\"return to the future\\".      For completists and people who like the Test For Echo / AOR-sounding Rush only.
B000002J1S|5.0|This is a terrific album and the whole experience has already been thoroughly documented in these reviews.  Top-notch musicianship, daring lyrics, addictive hooks, innovative concept, the whole bit.<br /><br />I've read lots of speculation about The Lamb's plot, but I think one potential theory has been overlooked.  I believe it's given away in the second verse of the first song on the album:<br /><br />... Metal motion comes in bursts,<br />But the gas station can quench that thirst<br />Suspension cracked on unmade road<br />The truckers eyes read Overload<br />And out of the subway,<br />Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid<br />Exits into daylight, spraygun hid,<br />And the lamb lies down on Broadway<br /><br />A few seconds after the introduction of Rael, I believe he's killed by this out of control truck with cracked suspension careening out from an alleyway, and lying dead on Broadway his soul is released and sent on this quest through some sort of \\"purgatory\\" (?).  The album documents Rael's path to salvation with reflections on society, his own life and adventures in the afterlife.  Rael has become the sacrificial lamb of societal decay, and in the end he finally does right by regaining his own lost love of self and others - at last discovering the \\"it.\\" that life and true compassion are made of.<br /><br />One of the most amazing aspects of this album is that it allows a unique experience for each listener.  The story lends itself to endless speculation and countless interpretations so it never really gets old.  The lyrics are just vague enough and the music layered enough to constantly re-discover it.  Once you \\"get it\\" it will haunt you for a very long time.  Simply an amazing accomplishment.<br /><br />Buy it, listen to it, listen to it five more times, then try to put it down.  I dare you.
B00003CWL6|5.0|it should be no surprise that this is one of the greatest films ever made; just look who wrote the screenplay. that's right, alan ball, <br />who also created the greatest television series of all time, \\"six feet under.\\" coincidence? i think not. <br />mr. ball will have a new series premiering on hbo(too good to be television) called \\"true blood\\" in autumn 2007.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Whoa...Rush fans may find this disappointing: the elements are there, but the band seems to have mellowed down a bit and yes, the acoustic guitar is at its most prominent (why is that a bad thing?). Neil Peart's reading is reflected in his songs: this time around it appears to be books questioning religious belief (Dawkin's God Delusion included) that have motivated him to write as he did, nowhere is this more apparent than on the beautiful \\"Faithless\\" where he reflects the common dilemma of atheists across the world. <br /> <br />I can only speak for myself: as a late-blooming Rush fan (Geddy's vocals had distanced me from the band), I can say while there is not a whole lot to love about this album, there is very little to dislike. IMHO, Geddy sounds in control and channels the songs better than on any previous album.   Lifeson has a lot more presence on this album, but Hope is by no means an innovative or exciting instrumental, and is the most forgettable track on the album for me and the one I am most likely to skip. <br /> <br />Give this one a fresh pair of ears and an open mind...IF you want to enjoy it. Isn't that why we listen to music?
B0007Y08QA|5.0|It had been a while since a movie shocked me. \\"The Machinist\\" is about a man who can't sleep. He is the thinnest man you might ever see for two odd hours. You might wonder if that is reason enough for you to watch this film and that is precisely why I took me a while to finally watch it. I like films that are based solely around one character but The Machinist is something else. I thought it would be easy to write a review for this film. Well, it's about time I start mine.<br /><br />I liked \\"Fight Club\\" but didn't like \\"Memento\\" too much and I thought \\"Seven\\" was good while I thought \\"Lucky Number Slevin\\" insulted movies. Some of these films werent as good as the others. The more popular ones had one or two characters to keep you interested. I liked Machinist because it had everything a character should be and more. In Trevor Reznik's heart resides a man of much mystery, intrigue and forgetfulness.<br /><br />I mean, 11 minutes into the film I knew I was going to love it. It is a masterpiece because it has to be watched again to be appreciated and understood. Some might argue and find faults - too bad for them. Overall, much like my fellow readers who've written very good reviews for the Machinist, I felt the background score was truly magnificent while the semi-lucid conscience of characters had it's own charm.<br /><br />The Machinist will grab your nerve and noodle it. Easily among my top 15 films of all time and I just saw it a week back. I will now go and watch every film by Christian Bale (loved Prestige) and meanwhile you should go watch The Machinist. Not to forget, fans of \\"Secret Window\\" might like this film,too.<br /><br />My Rating -> 9.5/10
B00005QGAT|5.0|Long after talk of Michael Jackson's nose, skin colour, Bubbles, etc. this is what he will be remembered for! It puts all todays RnB and Pop to shame. It's as raw, funky and fresh as it was in 1979! One of the greatest and creative albums Ive ever heard, the problem is people seem to skip it and listen to his more successful albums but trust me I have them all this is by far the best! The opening track sets the tone for the album and ITS OFF THE HOOK! I cant say anymore listen and you'll wonder why him and Quincy Jones dont get back together and make people feel Pop music again!!! (ps. Michael plays with milk bottles on the first track he just has born rythme!) GENIUS ALBUM
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|In 1 word, Inaccurate ~ they did NOT have Pigs running in and out of thier house!  The Bennett family wanted to be upper-class and would have died before they had live stock running through their home!  This is 100% Inaccurate/Unfaithful to the novel Jane Austen wrote.  30-40 minutes into the movie, I turned it off... Not to mention the colors they used in this movie - BLEGH!  Greys, Browns, Whites and Blacks ~ it makes everything look dirty and even dirtier.  Which is also why, I HATE this version. And don't even get me started on the acting ~ it's just as bad.  I made the mistake buying it without having seen it first, a mistake I will never repeat.  I WILL NEVER BUY THIS VERSION AGAIN - EVER!
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Let me preface the following comments by first saying that I LOVE Rush, for the same reasons everyone else here probably does.  That said, Snakes and Arrows is kind of...dare I say, boring?  I too read the recent Lifeson interview in Guitar One magazine where he got back to writing on acoustic instruments.  That's all fine and good, but for the most part nothing here is ear-grabbing or jaw-dropping.  No YYZ time changes, no Villa Strangiato explorations in \\"self-indulgence.\\"  The instrumentals that are included here lack the arpeggios, riffs and hooks that made early Rush instrumentals so engaging.  As for lyrics, okay Neil we know you like to ride your motorcycle and see the world and experience other cultures.  We don't really need more songs about it.  Please go back to reading some classic sci-fi; the Ayn Rand / Heinlein type themes work best!  I'm not gonna slam this record; I'm glad Rush are still together doing new stuff after almost 35 years.  And while Snakes and Arrows is, as someone above indicated, \\"listenable,\\" it's not especially memorable, and yes, it's the old songs I'll be waiting to hear on the tour.
B00005JPPI|4.0|Ted Crawford (Hopkins) shoots his wife Jennifer (Davidtz) in the face.  He loves her, but knows that she is having an affair, and cannot allow that to continue.  She is in a coma, and he is arrested.  But, Crawford has planned ahead, and what looks like an open and shut case - there is a confession and a weapon - is not.  Assistant D. A. Willy Beachum (Gosling)  is a hot shot who is not used to losing and is on the brink of a new job.  He takes the case, and soon finds he may be in over his head as the case falls apart around him.<br /><br />\\"Fracture\\" is an entertaining and engaging film.  95% of that is due to Hopkins and Gosling who both bring their A game.  Hopkins's Crawford is cold and calculating, Gosling's Beachum is arrogant and cocky, and yet both characters are likeable in their own way.  The plan to beat the charge is clever, and there is no real sense of how everything will turn out until the final few minutes.  \\"Fracture\\" is an enjoyable thriller that succeeds due to the talent of the lead actors.  I recommend it.
B000022TSW|5.0|I watched this when it first came out years ago, and I've just recently bought it again on the discount shelf at a shop and i have to say I'm still laughing hard and hate kyles mum more then ever. I cant wait to catch up on seasons 5-9 which i've ordered off here (order the seasons seperatly it works out much cheaper then in the one box of seasons 1-5). <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this movie, please do as soon as you can as it not only is funny, but says so much more on behalf of the perceptive nature of many people not just in america but in the west in general (well, in that i could say the east too, but the south park version in arabic was stopped after three episodes!) <br /> <br />Just watch it. You'll thank me another time ;)
B00009W0WM|5.0|This is an absolutely timeless classic.  It does have its faults... as do many of the films from this era (racial issues abound in movies from this time period, i.e. a younger woman referring to an older black man as \\"boy\\") but don't think for a moment I don't love the story.  As someone who began life many decades after this film was created, I have to wonder which, if any, of our generation's movies will even come close to the classic feel or lasting appeal of \\"Casablanca.\\"  Is anyone going to care about any of the current crop of movies 60 years from now?  Most of what I see being released currently just feels more and more superficial and disposable.  I'm also able to recognize that old films such as \\"Casablanca\\" do have a limited appeal nowadays.  One wouldn't necessarily call it action packed.  Comparatively speaking, most sets here are basic, special effects are non-existent, everything revolves around creating the relationships between the characters... the focus is on dialog, supporting pathos and ethos.  Most people my age wouldn't find this entertaining.  But please, watch this movie, and for a moment try to picture a classier, more idealistic world, separate from the continuous dumbing down of popular culture. I enjoy watching old movies, and this is among the best.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I saw \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" a little over a year ago when it was playing in the theaters. It's still on my mind. It recently came to the forefront when I saw a stack of DVDs in my local warehouse club. I was tempted to buy, but didn't. But the sight prompted this review. This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Absolutely stunning.<br /><br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a tragic love story, and it's tragic on every scale. It was set largely in rustic and scenic Wyoming (actually, Alberta) and it unfolded as two young men met as employees of a local rancher. Their task was to care for a herd of sheep on Brokeback Mountain over the summer months. They gradually became friends and then \\"special friends.\\" At the end of the summer, they parted and went on with their lives including getting married and raising families. The experience of Brokeback Mountain, however, proved too strong and they gradually started getting back together again, and again. The result was an aching love story and a growing tragedy for the men, their families and all concerned. The story riveted my attention and was painful to watch. My girlfriend and I left the theater and we couldn't talk. We were both choked up by the emotional impact. We discussed it for the next several months, however. The movie was that powerful.<br /><br />Everyone associated with this film should get an award of some kind. The director gently reached out and grabbed hold of the audiences' attention. He then allowed the tragic story to unfold amid a spendid scenic backdrop and accompanied by wonderful music. In watching it, you feel as if you're a part of the story, or at least a fly on the wall. This film is amazing and very powerful. View it, by all means. If the subject matter bothers you, don't buy and complain. This film deserves a lot more respect than some of the coarse remarks in certain viewer reviews.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|I have to say I went into this movie thinking that it was a typical Hollywood movie based only loosely on the original book. Emma is a favorite book of mine, and so I was expecting to not enjoy the movie at all. The picture of Paltrow shooting the arrow on the cover added to my trepidation. <br /> <br />Instead, I found a movie that was not straight out of the book, but was still much better than I expected. Mr. Knightly was the dashing gentlemen required. The relationship between he and Emma was less subtle than in the book. In the book, at least the first time you read it, there is a delightful suspense in the Harriet/Emma/Elton triangle as well as between Churchill/Emma/Knightly. In the movie there is none. Some of the other characters had similar double-edged qualities. The Mrs. Elton, for example, brought out her silliness - all the \\"Mr. E\\"'s, \\"Knightly\\"s, and \\"Maple Grove\\"s - but not her vindictiveness. <br /> <br />Another problem is that I did not see Emma's development as I remember through the book. Although the movie does have a very nice scene of Emma taking care of the poor, it seems to me that it focuses too much on her matchmaking aspects. One of my favorite continuing themes of the book is Emma's self-examinations when her various ways of controlling people blow up in here face, and I didn't get that so much from the film. I thus come away feeling that the cover shot was aptly (if a bit falsely) chosen. <br /> <br />All in all, a good adaptation of the book, surprisingly good for a big-star Hollywood effort. <br />
0060574216|5.0|This book is an invaluable resource for improving relationships.  I have never read another book that has managed to hit the nail so sqarely on the head when describing the \\"why's and when's\\" behind \\"alien\\" behavior.  I cannot believe how many times I have taken a man's behavior personally, judging his actions from the standpoint of why I, myself, would act in such a way, rather than understanding these things make perfect sense to him, and that some of my behavior is just as puzzling to him.  This book teaches you how to overcome this type of miscommunication.<br /><br />This book will decode for you mysterious behaviors such as \\"Mr. Fix It,\\" the phenomenon of \\"the cave,\\" lack of/initiating motivation, and \\"strange\\" translations of what you may believe to be be plainly obvious statements.  For the guys, the decoding includes how to initiate the release of (female) resentment, reasons for talking, the miscommunication of what may sound like blame, and the phenomenon of the \\"well.\\"  For everyone, there is great information about differing emotional needs, respectful communication, asking for/receiving support, and avoiding arguments.  I thought John Gray's analogies were right on the money.<br /><br />With this blueprint for communication, you cannot help but bring more ease into the relationship you have with your favorite alien.  This is the original foreign language dictionary for relationships, and it is still the best.
B000O75F7C|4.0|First of all it is wonderful that this new music from PT is causing so much conversation. I will say that it is a bit early to comment on how much I like or don't like it - I am just very HAPPY to have it. Albums produced in the hey day of Rock music(late 60's and early 70's) sometimes took a long time to absorb and kick in. But once they did they became a PART of you life.  <br /> <br />Steven Wilson now at 38 or 39 is not trying to reproduce music from the old days but to recreate the spirit that he knows once existed. The time when people invested themselves in music and really listened. It is a very uphill battle he is fighting - the times have changed and people don't have the time and want instant gratification which I think may be the one of the ideas/concepts of the album.  <br /> <br />Quick musical comment - you folks have done a great job disecting the music already. I love the music so far myself but I do find the 'childlike' vocal thing a little annoying. Truthfully I am not sure if kids these days are even worth the discussion
B000028U0Y|5.0|To me, Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison is magic. As good as his other stuff is, he was clearly at the top of his game during this performance. The electricity on stage combined with genuine enthusiasm of the prisoners is unlike anything I have ever heard before. There is no other way to put it, other than it all came together for this one CD. No matter how many times I hear it, it only gets better. I never get tired of listening to Folsom Prison. As good as the start of the concert is with a very enthusiastic \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", it's the ending with \\"Greystone Chapel\\", a song written by one of the prisoners that makes this CD truly unique. I have 4 children aging from 14 to 5 and have heard all of them singing songs from Folsom Prison. My all time favorite CD and it isn't even close. That \\"The legend of John Henry's hammer\\", was left of the original album, is almost impossible to believe.
B000NVL9KG|5.0|Emerson, Lake and Palmer once again gives the world another satisfying listen.  Again, the keyboards are everywhere, just like on the debut.  This time, though, they sort of changed gears and gave us some shorter and catchier tunes on Side 2.  <br /> <br />The first half of the album is one GIANT medley of keyboards.  It's really surprising to me how, even before I got into lengthy prog pieces and jams, I was STILL able to enjoy this song.  It's because the band knows how to make their jams melodic and interesting.  That was something they did very well back in the day. <br /> <br />It's a shame most people ignore the shorter songs on the second side of the album.  There's some good stuff there, and entirely worth hearing if you're a fan of the band.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I really don't care much for pop music, much less latin pop music when that crossover explosion happened (which I completely blame on Ricky Martin for creating) but I'll make an exception with Shakira's \\"Laundry Service\\". The first time I actually heard her music was when the music video for \\"Whatever, Whenever\\" came out six years ago. The song was pure ear candy with its infectious pop hooks. So I eventually bought Shakira's \\"Laundry Service\\". Much to my surprise I actually enjoyed the cd. The music is filled with catchy pop/rock hooks without being overly polished. I think the songwriting is kinda weak and at times silly. I thought Shakira sounds the best singing in her native tongue than in english but that's just me. Another flaw is Shakira's vocals which is somewhat shrill at times but otherwise this album is a fun, guilty pleasure of mine.
B000NVL9FQ|5.0|Emerson, Lake and Palmer's debut is a really awesome listen.  Even though plenty of rock bands out there have mixed rock with classical bits, the results were never as interesting and as close to classical as this album.  This is not only a pretty impressive debut for a band, but a groundbreaking debut from a band that never quite was able to come up with the same level of brilliance ever again.   <br /> <br />\\"The Barbarian\\" is a great keyboard-dominated fast-paced track that sort of resembles Deep Purple.  \\"Take a Pebble\\" really changes course by featuring soothing vocal melodies and lush keyboards.  There's a short boogie jam in the middle.  I forgot to mention that the entire album is dominated with keyboard solos.  It's not just a few short solos here and there- it's a pretty lengthy and complex listen.   <br /> <br />\\"Knife-Edge\\" again reminds me of Deep Purple (the two bands must have been friends).  The track 4 medley almost sounds like something recorded in the 1800s with its really powerful and old-fashioned sounding keyboard work.  \\"Tank\\" actually reminds me of a tank rolling over the hills, though I will admit it's probably the only track here where you can tell it's 70's music.  \\"Lucky Man\\" is just a beautiful and popular song that doesn't really resemble the rest of the album, but managed to make the band known to the public.  To me this song remains fresh even after thousands of listens. <br /> <br />Emerson, Lake and Palmer was never able to come up with another album as enjoyable as this one, though honestly they did come close with their next album.  Buy this one first, then the second one.
1582701709|5.0|A friend of mine from work asked me if I knew what \\"The Secret\\" is...I said no, so he told me to buy the book and read it!  He was excited so I got excited and ran out that evening and bought the book.  At this point, I have read up to page 38 and am so sorry to say that I find the information somewhat outlandish.  Look, I am college educated, grew up with religion in my life, and have read the bible, and countless books on everything from religion, psychology, communication, logic, ethics, EVERYTHING...and I understand that thinking positive is good and thinking negative is bad BUT - I do NOT think that our thoughts go out to the universe and get transmitted back to us either in a positive or negative way.  Sorry, I just cannot allow myself as a intelligent woman who is open-minded to buy into this claim.  Are humans that special, so awesome, that our thoughts go to the universe and we can make miracles happen by transmitting them with a simple good thought (sounds like Sci-Fri meets New-Age to me)?  Come on!   <br /> <br />Lastly, I think the people behind the making of this book and DVD are from the new-age movement and brilliantly came up with this premise to draw people in...like me, who want in on \\"The Secret\\" and are making a lot of money doing it! So, hats off to you! Just the name alone for the book \\"The Secret\\" is brilliant.  So, to those who are behind this ridiculous claim, aren't you at all wondering about the millions of people whom you deceived will find out exactly that you are frauds and how their obvious negative thoughts about the book will affect you?
B000O178BY|2.0|Ok, first off I've been a HUGE NiN fan for quite sometime and a loyal listener. I think the track \\"Great destroyer\\" can pretty much reflect my entire review of this CD. It's 1:45 of somewhat relateable lyrics and 1:30 random soulless noises clumsly thrown onto what could be considered a rythm. I loved the connection and the vision of the older NiN stuff (not just downward spiral, my favorite track of all time is \\"Where is everybody\\" as a matter of fact) but year zero doesn't have any of that. sadly it's seems as if this was made with no creative infuence at all, just more of rehashed stuff that has sold before. <br /> <br />To me, the \\"industrial\\" sound of NiN music symbolizes the conflict between humanity and the \\"machine\\", however it seems as though Mr. Reznor feels that in the future (which this album is supposedly based in) the machine wins becuase there little emotion to be heard. Please Trent, bring back natural sounding instruments and then re-mix them into the editted master pieces like you did in the past. Oh, and please, less distortion, more grand piano!!
B000NVIXFK|4.0|ok,ok so this is the first Rush album I've ever bought.  I had always been into speed metal and hair metal and just never paid attention to Rush in the 80's or there after.<br /><br />But I've grown to love prog metal over the years and when I heard this album was coming out, I couldn't wait.  So,I can literally take this album out of Rush's historical context and critique this album all by itself.  IT'S AWESOME!!<br /><br />The guitar work is incredible and Geddy Lee's vocals are a wonder to listen to.  The songs all flow well together.  The mix is very good as everything is clean and clear to the ear.<br /><br />I can see why Rush is the daddy of 'em all for prog metal (sorry Dream Theater) This band is phenomenal and this CD is a must have for any serious prog rock/metal fan.
0440234743|5.0|Ending was very unpredictable, makes for a bittersweet read but is definitely  worth your time. John Grisham has outdone himself.
B000007ODL|4.0|I was in high school when I first heard \\"Crazy Mama.\\"  I ran out and bought the 45--a thing we regularly did in antideluvian times before CDs and MP3 players were invented. As much as I loved \\"Crazy Mama,\\" the flip side--\\"Don't Go to Strangers\\"--was far better, in my opinion.  I gave \\"The Very Best of\\" a 4 rating instead of a 5 because it doesn't include \\"...Strangers.\\"  Even so, you can't go wrong with the \\"best of\\" the guy Clapton goes to for inspiration.  If you don't know J. J. Cale yet, or haven't heard \\"Call Me the Breeze\\" from his \\"Live\\" album, you're missing out!
0446577383|3.0|He says some silly things about guns.  In Absolute Power the shooter liked to use a .460 Weatherby Magnum. Silly!  <br /> <br />And in Camel Club the guy is wasted with a .22 revolver loaded with jacketed bullets! Huh?  <br /> <br />Then there is the deal about two guys carrying an unconscious victim a considerable distance in a tarp. Just try it.  And then one pulls a boat out of his pocket big enough to carry the three of them and, by the way, has an amazing silent motor to power it. Tom Swift stuff.  <br /> <br />But it's still a pretty good read.
B00000E2VC|5.0|Best heard on a rainy day. All you need is an hour to sit and listen with no interruptions with your favorite beverage and complete concentration. If this doesn't move you, nothing will. You won't be disappointed.
B000HT386M|2.0|They keep letting this guy (Adam Sandler) make movies; most likely because audiences flock to see most of his stuff, as was the case with \\"Click\\" (2006). I'm not going to go into a rant about the sophistication level of those who patronize their local multi-plexus. Suffice it to say that \\"Click\\" is as good as at least half the big-budget ($70 Million) stuff that is being released to the mainstream public. It raked in some serious cash last July. <br /> <br />Apparently Sadler has a thing for Frank Capra, as this is his second attempt to remake a Capra classic (insert \\"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\\"). \\"Click\\" is Sandler's take on \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" (1946). At least I assume the Jimmy Stewart classic was what they were aiming at because the end result seems more of a blend of \\"Scrooged\\" and \\"Being There\\". \\"Click\\" is probably Sandler's all-time best performance; in the style of and equal in quality to a good Tim Allen performance. He is assisted by a supporting cast of recognizable actors; Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, and Sean Astin. There is also a brief appearance by Jack Nicholson's daughter Lorraine, who looks amazingly like Jack back in his \\"Easy Rider\\" days; this is actually kind of scary. <br /> <br />Kate Beckinsale has the same role that Winona Ryder had in Mr. Deeds. While neither of them rank up there with Jean Arthur (the heroine in both Capra classics) they are still two of the best actresses out there today. I'm assuming both were very well paid because the scripts offer little opportunity for either to showcase their considerable acting skills. In fact the mismatch between talent and opportunity produces a strange discordance in both films. This might be one of those cases where a less talented performer would have been a better fit.  <br /> <br />George Bailey (and Scrooge) had an attitude adjustment after being granted visions of the past and the future by his guardian angel. Michael Newman's (Sandler) angel (Walken), who works in the local Bed, Bath and Beyond store, gives him a television remote control that he can click whenever he wants to fast-forward his life past the parts that are annoying distractions to his workaholic aspirations. At first this seems like a wonderful device as he can dispense with the family interactions that complicate his life. But Michael soon discovers that the device programs itself and shifts him further and further into the future. The remote can also freeze a scene, mute the sound, and select past scenes from his life; but the film mostly concentrates on its fast-forwarding function. <br /> <br />\\"Click\\" is technically a comedy and apparently some find a lot to laugh about. There are some funny moments early in the production but I found the humor to be in short supply for most of the story. <br /> <br />Ultimately \\"Click\\" has a \\"Groundhog Day\\" sort of theme. That in tuning out much of what life has to offer we miss life itself. Since this cold detached way of living is what most of us do (at least to some degree) it tends to undermine any comic quality the film might have. Of course unless your taste in comedy runs to Sandler's usual focus on bodily functions it doesn't take much to do this anyway.  <br /> <br />Inexplicably, even at his most detached, patient and accepting people surround Michael. His wife (Beckinsale), his parents (Winkler and Kavner), and his children continue to love him despite the absence of any lovable qualities. Similar to those who love this film. <br /> <br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B000NVIXFK|1.0|This cd sucks.  Did their producer have the nerve to compare it to 2112, AFTK, Hemispheres?  Whatever. Bring Terry Brown back! Every so many years Rush puts out a new cd and every year I'm shocked that it's worse than the previous effort.  I'm sure fans all summer long will be wishing songs like Dreamline, Xanadua, Red Barchetta, 2112, Subdivisions would hurry up and get over on tour so Rush can play tracks off this monstrosity.  I don't mean to be so down on the boys, but I know they could do so much better.  Couldn't they?
0375713751|3.0|Having been a working mom myself before I quit to be a stay-at-home mom, I expected this book to really hit home.  Instead, I found that Kate seemed to be more a caricature of a working mom.  She completely lacked introspection and I felt that the author simply created funny situations and placed a generic \\"working mom\\" character into them.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I have always been a big Rush fan, many days were spent listening to them through my old AM radio as that's all I had until I got a real stereo and some abums under my belt.<br /><br />Rush have always moved onward and with the times to a certain extend and the musicianship has always been excellent. Their early years were a more straight ahead approach and then came the prog years and them came the lighter 80's stuff and then the 90's stuff which was Rush trying to find itself with some pretty diverse sounding cd's like Counterparts, which I reallly liked and Test For Echo which was ok. A renewed Rush appperared in 2002 with Vapor Trails which again was something a little different as it was a lot heavier sounding and had no guitar solo's, not one? While Vapor Trails had some really good spots, it like many other of the Rush offerings of late is lacking something. It's hard to describe, but it just seems like the magic is gone. That special something just isn't their anymore!<br /><br />So here we are a few years later with yet another Rush offering on the table. Is this cd what we've come to expect from this great band? Well the answer is yes and no! There are some very cool parts found on the lastest disc, however after a few spins it really hasn't grabbed a hold of me like the older stuff does. I find it's lacking true staying power. This cd is a good listen, but will I be listening to it or say some other Rush cd's I have in say a month or two. The answer is, I'll probably be back listeing to those classic Rush offerings as they seem to have more to offer in my honest opinion.<br /><br />So I have to give it a 3 as I was really hoping for a more interesting mix of tunes.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|BUY IT!!! You will NOT be disappointed..  <br /> <br />I bought this whole package because i am an addicted person when it comes to watching Friends... So, to start with, the packaging is amazingly simple. You would want to just feel the cover and look at it for its complex simplicity if i may say... <br /> <br />Inside, you'll find all there is to know about Friends... 60 DVDs of the finest quality, with printed images, and beautifully put. Now i, for instance, never think of the safety of my cds, i don't handle them quite carefully. But, when i got this friends package, i took care of every single dvd there is! After using each one, i cleaned it and put it back very neatly and carefully... So you would want to take care of them as if they're your children! <br /> <br />What i am saying is that this is everything in one thing.. It contains all the special features, gag reels, add-ons, documentaries, interviews, EVERYTHING, and even some things you have never seen on tv!  <br /> <br />BUT, you may find some very small problems with the subtitles: for example, some episodes only have Korean subtitles, which disappointed me only a little because i can understand when they talk and i don't much need subtitles... Other than that, they're AWESOME! <br /> <br />So if you're thinking more than once of buying this package, you've thought too much!!!
B00005ATZT|5.0|Movies based on television shows are frustrating for the creative team behind the adaptation and often prove to be somewhat hit and miss.  The reason is because in a TV show the writer/director gets to spread his/her story over the course of multiple episodes or even an entire season.  In a movie you only get an average of 2 hours to get your story out, which can cause problems when adapting a television series, whether it be a long-running or short lived show, for theaters because you just don't have the luxury of time.  There have been some successful adaptations, \\"Starsky & Hutch\\", `Star Trek', `Mission: Impossible', and even `Charlie's Angels' (though I didn't care for either incarnation of the franchise), along with the success there have been those that failed \\"The Avengers\\" was lackluster, and \\"The Dukes of Hazzard\\" was the most recent, and possibly the worst adaptation I have seen in a long while.  In 1993, Warner Brothers felt the calling to try their collective hand at an adaptation, and their choice was the hit TV series \\"The Fugitive\\".  To assist in the success of their endeavor the WB enlisted top-notch, veteran acting talents Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, and hired director Andrew Davis hot off his highly successful submarine action film, \\"Under Siege\\". <br /> <br />\\"The Fugitive\\" tells the story of Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), who after a charity event arrives home to find an intruder in his house and his wife murdered.  After fighting off the intruder, Kimble alerts the police, and upon their arrival Kimble is surprised by the fact that he is arrested for the murder of his own wife.  After being found guilty at his trial and sentenced to prison, the prison bus Kimble is being transported by crashes in front of an oncoming train.  After being freed by a correctional officer to assist with the other prisoners, Dr. Kimble flees in hopes of tracking down the one-armed murderer and proving his innocence.  However, hot on Richard's trail is a relentless U.S. Marshal, Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), and his team of deputies, who will stop at nothing until their man is caught.  Let the chase begin! <br /> <br />Clearly the executives at Warner Brothers made an excellent decision to make this adaptation, and managed to find the perfect cast, writer, and director to pull it off.  The cast, led by Harrison Ford (an actor that delivers a terrific performance every time) and Tommy Lee Jones (who was great in this role and was rewarded with the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), all give excellent performances, fleshing out each individual character and making the movie believable and real to the audience.  The story by David Twohy (\\"Pitch Black\\" and \\"The Chronicles of Riddick\\") is full of twists and turns, with riveting drama and action along with bits of comedy sprinkled about to lighten things up just a bit.  The direction of Andrew Davis, though not flashy by any means, delivers a very tight, well-paced manhunt movie that keeps the audience fully engrossed from start to finish, even though they already have a pretty good guess what the outcome will be, based on the source material. <br /> <br />As I stated earlier some adaptations of TV shows to movies work out well and some don't, and the reasons generally stem from what I pointed out in the beginning of this review, but sometimes the results may vary depending on how committed to the project the cast/crew and the studio are.  It's nice to see that for \\"The Fugitive\\" all parties involved in the making of this picture gave their best, and the fruits of the labor paid off big time, making this movie one of the best TV series adaptations to ever be made. <br /> <br />\\"The Fugitive\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
B000LC3ID8|5.0|Saw 3 is not the best of the Saws, but it sure is amazing...  <br /> <br />I recommend it for the people who liked Saw 1 and Saw 2, as it is a story being continued. There isn't much tricks or traps in Saw 3, but the ones that exist are extraordinary and will not get you bored. I hurt when they hurt, i held on to my chair when there was a painful scene, and the suspense kept my teeth stuck together... <br /> <br />Some may think it's disgusting to watch so much blood out of a person in one movie, but the blood is just the end of it; what's more interesting and worth the watch are the traps used and the story...
B000NVIXFK|5.0|How in the world are you guys able to make a judgement in ONE day? It's obvious some of you took it for one spin and jumped on the net to do a review. Take some time out of your MTV universe and listen to it for a week before you cast it off as good or bad please.
B00004SZWD|5.0|You know I found the album of him with two records and listening to it is just so AMAZING!!!  Look at all the instruments Mr. Stevie Wonder plays and how he composes each and every song, along with the wisdom Stevie kicks down from his songs. I mean, what ever happened to all that SOUL in today's music???<br /><br />Much love for the parents and the purpose that Stevie Wonder has continued to live out!
B000EHSVQ4|1.0|Here we go again! More crusader bashing as if all christian militants were good for nothing scoundrels. The clergy are made out to look like cowards and steeped in vice and earthly riches. Europeans are in it for the spoils and are barberic looking for a slaughter. What irks me so much is not the fact that the history is inaccurate but that this film is full of one sided propaganda. It makes me believe that Ridley Scott must hate western man including himself. Authentic history reveals that the crusades came about as a defensive reaction due to the European pilgrims that were being harrased, robbed, taken into slavery or slaughtered in the holy lands. One may see this as just entertainment but it plays on the subconcience and will leave many in error about the noble cause taken on by such heros as St. Luis IX, Blessed Baldwin the IV ( Lepar King), Godfrey de Boullion who said 'I will not accept the crown where Our Lord was crowned with thorns' and many other noble warriors of Christiandom who were there to protect the common people. The correct term for these times is called the middle ages. Universities and hospitals arose during these times, that in itself is very significant progress. Those that claim that these were dark ages of no progress are led by false, modern, revisionist history or make hollywood they're source for history.

B000ASSDVA|4.0|O.K. someone has to have the courage to repackage and properly restore this film which I believe has not been done due to our politicaly correct society. In today's world there are few who care about the story of a militant Christian knight but this is an awsome epic film with authentic history. I give this film four stars for the score alone! As soon as this dvd is restored properly I will give it twenty stars. Charleton Heston is at his best and the supporting actors are worthy. Herbert Lom is great as the muslim villan and Sophia Loren does a good job in her role. This film has a lot to offer. This disc IS AVAILABLE through amazon!!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Music is HIGHLY subjective... that's a given.  You can either feel enthusiastic, lukewarm, or dissapointed about Rush's latest effort.  But what I can't accept or understand is some of the whiny reviewers that EXPECTED this to sound like 'Moving Pictures' or '2112' or (fill in your favorite older Rush album), as if the band existed to solely cater to YOUR musical whims and expectations!  To those individuals, please can the self-centered stance, and open your minds to accept inevitable and unavoidable change and progress.  'Progressive rock', after all, partially encompasses this view of change and moving forward, as well as the requisite prog style of music tempo and time signature changes.  Anywho, to my middle-aged ears, 'Snakes & Arrows' is truly excellent and beautiful, with LOTS of passion, texture, and mastery, which can only be the creation of a veteran, respected, world-class band like RUSH.  The lyrics are 'vintage Peart' and even 'darker' than usual this time around, questioning faith and presumably the existence of 'God' (or at least a benevolent 'God') at various points throughout.  Can you blame or fault him?!  Man is 'laid bare' to fend for himself in an unpredictable, often cruel, vexing world subject to its vagaries and hardships (Peart knows this in 'real life', given the beyond cruel, tragic loss of his daughter and wife)!  In summation of this short review, I must also comment on the excellent production and sonics of this epic and masterful CD, which is first rate.  They did a SUPERB recording and mastering job, and it shows especially on a killer high end, high resolution audio system (I run McIntosh gear and Magneplanar speakers, as an example).  LONG LIVE RUSH!  THANK YOU, GEDDY, ALEX, AND NEIL.
0226752275|5.0|Frankenstein is a great work, though one that has consistently been underrated<br />and misrepresented. Frankenstein is, in the words of Donald H. Reiman, \\"the<br />most seminal literary work of the Romantic period\\". It is a work of profound<br />and radical ideas, written in poetically powerful prose. Frankenstein is not<br />really a gothic novel, although its author sometimes employs gothic<br />conventions and language, and even spoofs them. Rather, Frankenstein is an<br />enduring myth, a novel of ideas, and above all, a moral allegory about the<br />evil effects of intolerance and prejudice, ostracism and alienation, both to<br />the victims of intolerance and to society at large.<br />Since there are some good reviews here, I'll concentrate on this<br />particular edition -- the Chicago edition edited by James Rieger.<br />This is one of the two best editions of Frankenstein available (the other<br />being the Norton Critical edition). Most importantly, this is<br />the original 1818 edition, rather than the inferior, bowdlerized 1831<br />edition -- which is the most common, and the only one that was available for<br />well over a century. James Rieger was the first editor to make the case for the<br />superiority of the 1818 edition, and he did so convincingly enough that almost all<br />scholars of English Romanticism now prefer the 1818 edition.  Rieger took a lot<br />of flak from feminist academics for asserting that Percy Bysshe Shelley was,<br />at the very least, a minor collaborator.  In my considered opinion, Shelley was the primary author, and Mary Shelley was merely his secretary.<br />The appendices in this edition include the full text of John William Polidori's<br />story, \\"The Vampyre: A Tale\\" and Byron's brief fragment of a vampire story.<br />Rieger's comments on the 1831 Introduction (written ostensibly by Mary, but with<br />much help from her father, William Godwin) are perceptive.<br />Please check out my own book, The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein, which<br />makes the case that Frankenstein was really written by Percy Bysshe Shelley,<br />one of the greatest poets in the English language.,  one of the greatest poets in the English language.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|I would love to disagree with Alana Nash, the Amazon reviewer, but I can't.  I love the CD.  I love the music, the musicianship, the vocals, but there really is something missing.  I wish I could put my finger on it.  It could/should have been much better, but maybe I expected worlds to collide.
B000007R13|5.0|In fact, this was the first DVD Audio I purchased; didn't even know what I was doing.  I'd had a DVD player about 2 weeks, and when I found out they were doing DTS surround for audio only, I had to find something, and this was the 1st release I found.  I did not hesitate...Fillmore East is STILL one of my favorite albums. <br /> <br />I never had the quad LP, but evidently that is the mix that was used to create this.  It no doubt would have been better if they had gone back to the multi-tracks to create a new surround mix, but budgets are budgets.  All things considered, this is a wonder to hear.  The output isn't very high, so you'll have to turn it up...come on, use some of that amp!  Also, it's true that the guitars are in the rear speakers (and that's about ALL that's in the rear speakers.  I think it's a good thing, because you are able to hear just about everything the guitarists are doing all the time, which wasn't the case with all the 2 channel mixes.  Also, the drums seem to be stronger; more punch to the low end.  I'm not going to get rid of my stereo mixes, but most of the time when I want to listen to this album, this is the version my hand goes to (I don't have the SACD version).  I'm somewhat amazed it's still available.
B000OCXF0Q|4.0|+ 1/2 stars.  I found this an irresistible piece of bubble gum!  This album kicks off with Girlfriend and doesnt let up from there, even the ballads are great.  Sure it may be about as punk as Blink 182(Travis Barker contributes drums on three tracks) but how can you not love the bratty, sassy attitude along with a great deal of swearing?  Also the layered vocals are very strong.  The DVD that comes with it is hilarious and a great look into the recording process.  The deluxe is the way to go with the other version being 'clean.'
B000002H97|5.0|This cd is a favorite to many people. Played by a band known as Metallica \\"The Black Album\\" is by far one of their best. This 80s rock band blows other cds out of the water. The unique and head banging style of the guitar, bass, and drums in this cd is not even comparable to any cd out there other than another oof their own. The songs on this cd such as \\"Enter Sandman\\" is definitly a known hit rocked by this awesome band.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|I have to agree with several of the reviews already that this album is not the Rush that I have felt so enthusiastic about in the past. <br /> <br />I am actually very surprised by the number of really positive reviews. <br /> <br />This is the first day I purchased and listened to the CD, so I can only hope that it will get better with repeated playings, but so far I just don't get it. <br /> <br />Listeners are all very different, so some of the feelings, experiences, and moods we bring to listening can account for the varied likes and dislikes expressed here. <br /> <br />What's Wrong with Rush? <br /> <br />I can't identify with the patterns on this new CD.  Instead of the music flowing and building on itself, it sounds disjointed to me.  Noises and patterns interrupt the direction of the music in very dicordant ways that I just don't get.  Sometimes it sounds as if they wrote a bunch of cohesive songs, then split up the songs into slices, and finally randomly mixed the slices into the forced songs that appear. <br /> <br />I am reminded of the band Yes, where on some of there early albums the music was wonderfully melodic (Close to the Edge, The Yes Album).  And then on other albums the music sounded forced and disjoint (Tales from the Topographic Oceans, Tormato). <br /> <br />What's Wrong with me? <br /> <br />I understand that Rush put a lot of effort and time into this album.  So why don't I appreciate it?  I've come to two conclusions.  1) They are pursuing direction that just don't please me anymore.  2) They have been around music so much that they have evolved to a higher level a musical patterns that the lay person may have trouble relating too. <br /> <br />Do I just take the narrow nostalgic view? <br /> <br />I think some people are too ready to dismiss negative reviewers as being stuck in a nostalgic \\"hit\\" period. <br /> <br />Before you categorize me as such keep this in mind: <br />1) I love just about everything Rush has done between Hemispheresand Counterparts. <br />2) I feel like they have been losing me a little bit more with each release starting with Test for Echo. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I'm happy that some people are seeing some really cool creative stuff on this new album, Snakes and Arrows. <br /> <br />As for me, its even hard to listen to.  Well, Rush has been one of the best musical experiences for me in my life while the good times lasted. <br />
B000002KHF|5.0|This album came after \\"Astral week\\" I find \\"Moondance\\" every bit as good, in fact more enjoyable to listen to. It has a timeless quality about it, and it really dos not sound like it's 37 years old. Overall it has a good fel to it. The first song,\\"And it Stoned Me\\",reminds me a lot of the band, and the brass, which is used throughout. The album has a very soulful vibe. On a couple of the songs there's even a gospel flaver (\\"come running\\" and 'crazy love\\"). When he sings\\"iI want to rock your gypsy soul\\" in \\"into the mystic\\", he makes it sound like tere is nothing mor important in the world. The best moment on the whole album is\\"Turn it up? Turn it up? Turn it up? a little bit higher\\" in caravan. <br />   If people listen to the album a few times, the songs will stay with them forever.

B000JJRIN4|3.0|Gwen Stefani's solo debut album Love.Angel.Music.Baby was highly above-average and it had no problem going multi-platinum, proving that Gwen had what it takes to excel outside of No Doubt. THIS album, The Sweet Escape, doesn't seem to be having any trouble selling either, but the thing is, it really isn't that spectacular.<br /><br />When it comes to critics, this is one of those albums that people seem to either love or hate. I personally think the album is average, but I'll also say that I wholeheartedly agree with reviewer Musac Critic when s/he said that most of the songs on here sound like they didn't make the cut on Gwen's last album. \\"Early Winter\\" (featuring Keane pianist Tim Rice-Oxley) is tolerable, but other tracks just don't impress like they should. I mean, \\"Wind It Up\\" is okay, but come on; didn't that song use to be called \\"Hollaback Girl\\"?<br /><br />Filler continues with the Swizz Beatz-produced \\"Now That You Got It\\". And \\"Yummy\\" is fine until Pharrell drops his monotonous verse. Speaking of that, the Neptunes produce a number of tracks on here, but the subject matter of the songs range from weak to wack. \\"U Started It\\" sounds like a twelve-year-old wrote it, and \\"Breakin' Up\\" never should have happened.<br /><br />As other reviewers have stated, the only songs really worth listening to on here are the title track and the necessary Linda Perry song, \\"Wonderful Life\\". But even those two songs are a far cry from what we know Ms. Stefani is capable of. She's still a treat for the eyes, but The Sweet Escape needs a little more sweetening.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000NVIXFK|4.0|To begin with, let me say that the sound of Snakes & Arrows is fantastic.  The mastering process seems to have been improved 100% since Vapor Trails in 2002.  Generally the sound is thick and crisp.  In terms of recording quality I think that it is the best sounding Rush album that there has ever been.  Stylistically it is a hard rock album, probably the \\"hardest\\" record that Rush has made in a long time.  The sound is very textured, thick and layered with lots of interesting sounds. <br /> <br />Musically they seem to want to avoid creating or playing anything that is too obvious or conventional.  After 30+ years of making music I can see how the typical rock song would be boring for these master musicians.  There is very little on this record that is \\"catchy\\" on the first few listens and sometimes a single song doesn't seem to hold itself together well, like the person who wrote the verse was working in a different room from the person who wrote the chorus.  The melodies are unusual and will require some effort from casual listeners to appreciate.  Some listeners may simply reject this music as non-melodic nonsense or noise, but as a Rush fan, I hope that this record is like a good piece of modern art, the more you examine it, the more fascinating it becomes.  There are some great time signature changes in the song \\"Workin' Them Angels\\" and I really enjoy some parts of some of the songs.   <br /> <br />Lyrically the record is rather dark and sad with themes of determinism and resignation in the face of all the evils of the world.  They went from \\"I will choose freewill\\" in 1981 to \\"we can only grow the way the wind blows - we can only bow to the here and now or be broken down blow by blow.\\"  This is not a record that I would want to listen to over and over without having some more positive material to listen to on the side.  For me this is not a fault of the album, and I appreciate Neil Peart's willingness to honestly express all aspects of life, the good and thebad.  Perhaps this change is a function of maturity and a recognition that eventually innocence is lost the real world must be looked squarely in the eyes.  In any case these lyrics are more profound and heartfelt than anything recently on the radio or MTV.  Even with this lyrical aspect of the record, Neil Peart still avoids the silly \\"drowning in pools of black despair\\" stereotype of modern rock music.  I get the feeling that he simply wrote down what he was feeling about certain things in this world and I appreciate that honesty.  There might be some really positive messages here, but with the serious, heavy and ponderous sound of the album- it just feels sad. <br /> <br />In summary, this record may not appeal to everyone, but if you are interested in progressive rock music and are willing to expend a little effort in listening to this album it might be worth your time.  Personally, I haven't made up my mind yet, but I'm trying to like it. <br />
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Whether or not you enjoy or appreciate nature documentaries, I cannot imagine someone not enjoying this series. It's simply the best way to show off your new HD TV and HD-DVD or Blu-Ray system. The picture is excellent, the sound is great, and the documentary itself will likely go down as the greatest nature documentary of all time. <br /> <br />It should be noted that this set is the BBC version of the series, and is narrated by David Attenborough. In the U.S., where I watched the show on the Discovery channel, it was narrated by Sigourney Weaver. Weaver's narration is certainly adequate, accurate, and perfectly serviceable. She only occasionally mispronounced a few words that most people wouldn't recognize anyway. However, I find that I generally prefer Attenborough's version. It's also worth noting that these boxed versions come with slightly differently edited versions of the shows from their televised versions (i.e., extended, with significantly more material per episode). <br /> <br />From a scientific perspective, for the most part the series sticks to facts rather than making moral judgements or stating personal opinion. Thankfully, the editors and producers usually let nature speak for itself, which is powerful enough on its own. <br /> <br />The series contains a lot of eye candy, but there is a significant proportion of it that contains never-before-seen behavior and it's all captured in high definition. If you're looking for something different to show off your HD TV, you could do much worse than this.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|To give everyone an idea where I am coming from, I have been a fan of Rush since I first saw them live way back in 1982. My CD collection for Rush begins with A Farewell To Kings and includes every studio release up to this one. The only one that deserves less than 3-stars from me is their last one, Vapour Trails. My all time favorites wound up being Power Windows and Hold Your Fire (hey, I like keyboards).<br /><br />I cannot compare this release to anything they have done, since it feels like a new direction for them. Groping in the dark for past comparisons would be unfair to them. Let this one stand on it's own merits. It is not perfect, but it is certainly much better than average. My least favorite cuts on this one are The Larger Bowl, Bravest Face, and Good News First. The rest get better and better from there.<br /><br />Neil's lyrics are his usual trademark word sculptures, which I truly admire, no matter what their tone may be.<br /><br />I am also quite pleased at the amount of acoustic stringed instruments used here and am already wondering how they are going to pull off all of these overdubs on tour this summer. I know that it will be worth the 500-mile drive.<br /><br />For those of you looking for \\"A Passage to Bangkok 2007\\", hold your breath (multiple puns intended). You won't find anything like that here!
B000NVIXFK|3.0|After Vapor Trails, which was nothing short of masterful and incredibly powerful, one of the greatest albums ever, I should have known Rush would come out with something less spectacular. Don't get me wrong, for any other group, Snakes and Arrows is a masterpiece. For Rush, it's mediocre. Like Roll the Bones, it starts out with a bang, with a catchy, driven masterpiece in Far Cry (see Dreamline from Roll the Bones), then turns into a bunch of mid-tempo, mellower songs, right until the end, again, like Roll the Bones. Neil's lyrics really save this outing, as the music is not all that inspired on this release, but the lyrics are thought-provoking and in some places almost controversial (such as the subtle attacks on religion). All in all, a mixed bag. I miss the power of Vapor Trails. I was hoping they would continue exploring that direction. Rush has already done this album.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Nickel Back has done it again, with their album Silver Side Up, another great hit. Their song \\"How You Remind Me\\" was nominated for record of the yearat the 2003 Grammy Awards. \\"Never Again\\" is a discription of demestic violence. Chad Kroeger, Ryan Peake(vocals, guitar); Mike Kroeger (bass); Ryan \\"Nik\\" Vikedal (drums)make this band ROCK!!! Silver Side Up is an awesome follow up to The State ending with the taken acustic-meets-electric track of \\"Good Times Gone\\"
B000NVIXFK|4.0|2007 has been and will be a great year for new releases, and this disc is right there with the best of them. The songs on \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" are fun, catchy, and well thought out. Plenty of rocking tunes, the three instrumentals are great, a tiny bit of the blues, softer acoustic passages - something for everyone. Geddy's voice is smooth and his bass lines growl with fire and passion, Alex's playing gets better with age and there are plenty of tasty guitar riffs, and Neil's drumming is classy, never overplaying but always right where he should be. There are no keyboards on this disc and I do miss them a bit. Nevertheless, after 33 years of making music (I believe this is their nineteenth studio record) it's amazing that Rush still creates a quality of music this incredible with all the original members, less the drummer from the first album. How many bands accomplish this? Rock on Rush!
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I like to think of Rush albums like moods.  A particular moment in time.  Never the same twice.  Most times I get a new Rush album and crank quickly through all the tracks and ponder.  Some songs hook me right off the bat but others take more time to settle in.  Never once have I hated a song.  They are all different. Thats what makes it good, special.  I'm someone who's been there from the beginning.  I've listened to everything at least a thousand times.  Sometimes I wonder why I listen to Rush so much.  I think it's because it's always different and each album/song puts me in a different frame of mind and a different mood.  I've had this album for about 12 hours now and I'm already hooked.  I really think it sounds great technically and has a lot of new musical feeling.  You will drift through some bluesy riffs, country sounding solos, sections of earthy acoustic guitar (nashville tuned, not 12 string) and mic'ed overdriven amps.  There is a lot to like about this album. I can't help to think how sad it is that people are complaining that it's not like Hemispheres or 2112.  Do they even own any of the other albums? Can we move on after 20+ years?  As someone who owns all the albums and even loves the much maligned Presto, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire, I now have something new to love.  It's different, as it should be.  Thanks Rush for something totally new. See you in Boston!
B000J4QWNQ|4.0|I must say I wasn't a big fan of this movie upon my first viewing in the theater last year.This is a slightly different version of the movie, and it's starts where it should had started: a speedboat race. The theatrical version started in a night club and it was cut like there was something missing. This movie is a far cry from the fabled TV show from the 80's and none of the leads were try to mimick the actors before them. This is brand new Crocket and Tubbs, and Mann had created another of his new modern day crime \\"saga\\" like Heat and Collateral were before it.Mann's vision come through very detailed on this HD DVD. His signature night shots were all in display here, however some of them had \\"added\\" noise to it for style, and also since this was shot on HD cameras, it's limitations were came through on some of the dark shots.Daytime shots however looked fantastic most of the time with great colors and superb contrast. Sound however  was a mixed bag. The dialog was mumbled by the actors at times, so the level had to be turned up a bit. The first action shoot out displayed awesome dynamic range with terrific punch, thanks to the LFE channel. Separation was  superb too. However the final big shoot out had a wimpy sound to the guns, no doubt by choice, but nevertheless it was puzzleing why.This is a combo disc from Universal meaning on one side you have the HD content[director's cut] then on the flipside you have the SD content[theatrical cut]. The combo disc has been a controversial issue mainly because many current HD players have issues to play them correctly. Make sure you have the latest firmware on your  HD DVD player.This is the version to own for collectors.
0780628551|3.0|\\"The Astronaut's Wife\\" is simply one of those films that I think I picked up due to an interest in Charlize Theron and Johnny Depp's acting careers more so than in the film itself.  Having said that, this DVD still sat on the shelf for a number of years until recently.  From a purely \\"psychological thriller\\" point of view, this film delivers but does so in a rather mediocre way.  From a Sci-Fi, point of view, the film struggles in all aspects other than the basic concept of the plot.    In typical fashion, Charlize Theron delivers her part seamlessly.  As with all the parts I've seen her play, she gets inside the role and plays it out extremely well.  It's just too bad her performance cannot save the script or the director's vision of this film.  I can't say that I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan but I can say that I have a passing interest in his film career and have definitely seen much better performances from him prior to and after making this film.  Granted, the part he played here may have been a rather subdued role however; his interpretation of the role left much to be desired in his performance.    I cannot say that I've seen any of the very few other films that have been directed by Rand Ravich however, given this film's performance both in the theaters and in post theater market, one can easily see why he's directed very few films since.  The score for the film was fitting per scene though.    The Premise:    Spencer (Johnny Depp) and his fellow astronaut end up out of communication for a mere two minutes while working on a satellite.  Upon their return to Earth, those two minutes become pivotal in the effect it has on Spencer and Jillian's (Charlize Theron) lives and the lives of his fellow astronaut and his wife played by the ever beautiful Donna Murphy.     Overall, I would recommend this film only in the light that if you're a fan of either Johnny Depp or Charlize Theron and wishing to review their entire bodies of work.  Beyond that reason, the film fails to deliver in either genre that it was reaching for.  {ssintrepid}    Special Features:  None
B000MV9026|5.0|The movie \\"Happy Feet\\",is cute and funny.This landscape of it is antarctica..The Penguins there have to find their own love songs.If movies goes like penkins and love movies,then this is the show for them.
B000N3SRRC|4.0|I suppose after Clutch made three straight records which were consistently amazing through and through (Pure Rock Fury, Blast Tyrant, Robot Hive/Exodus), at some point there has to come a let down.  Every band has a creative genius mode, and these guys were locked in for those glorious records.  I'm glad we Gearheads were along for the ride.  Which is not to say that From Beale Street to Oblivion is a bad record, it's great.  It has everything we've come to expect - great lyrics, great riffs, and great instrumental performances.  It is however, missing that little bit of magic oomph that has brought the last three full lengths 5 star status and nearly universal acclaim.   <br /> <br />Let's start with what is right on this record.  Neil's vocals continue to improve with age, and his wit is as keen as ever.  The best lyricist in rock today (perhaps ever) does not let up on this record.  His stories never fail to entertain, his knowledge, insights and comic timing are once again flawless, and, as ususal there are a half dozen turns of phrase that just make you say WOW, I wish I'd thought of that.  His singing is great, though it is not quite as perfect as on Robot Hive and Blast Tyrant, where he had a chance to really move the listener with some deep, goose bump inducing moments.  I find none of those here - save perhaps the creative mix/match semi cover \\"Electric Worry\\" (which finds Clutch interestingly mixing a Mississippi Fred McDowell song with some new lyrics and arrangements).  In the up and down history of white blues that is rock and roll, I don't know if anyone has ever captured the true essence of the vocal blues like Neil Fallon.  You can just FEEL it.  Elsewhere, JP's drumming is as crisp and imaginative as ever, and the rest of the band kicks as usual.  So what makes this a four star record, a very good but not great release?  It's the riffs, stupid!  For a band that hangs its hat on the riff as much as Clutch, riff-wise this is one of their least invigorating efforts.  Sult and Maines seem to be re-using some stuff at this point which isn't a great sign.  I swear I heard the riffs to \\"Child of the City\\" a half dozen times from this band.  This one is filler.  So is Rapture of Ridley Walker (a shame because the lyrics are great).  The same can be said for the re-recorded One Eye Dollar (appeared on the experimental Jam Room), which has no point other than Neil has said that live it flowed really well as a backside to Electric Worry.  It's a fun little song, but I think most of us Clutch fans would like to hear something NEW there. <br /> <br />All in all, it's a solid album.  If you're a Clutch fan you'll find plenty to love.  The first three songs rock as hard as anything they've done.  This band has a hard time doing anything wrong in my opinion.  When geniuses are a little lazy, you get From Beale Street to Oblivion.  They could have worked on this for another year, no doubt, and produced another five star album.  However, they are working class guys, and they need to make a living touring.  They're more popular than ever, and they needed to strike soon, when the iron was hot.  It all makes sense.  Still, there are some great moments here - the heavy metal urgency that kicks off the record, the continuation of full on baptism by blues courtesy of the First Holy Church of Clutch, Pastor Fallon ripping on vegans (haha!), and the same irresistible groove we've come to know and love. <br /> <br />Again, compared to Pure Rock Fury (the most aptly titled album ever, total punk-metal raw sludge blues), Blast Tyrant (every song is A+ - excellent editing, no filler), and Robot Hive/Exodus (their most creative release, lyrically and musically) this one falls a little short.
B000O179A4|5.0|The DREAMGIRLS rock the stage especially Jennifer Hudson,who rose to fame on AMERICAN IDOL and rose even higher in this film. Great moral support from Hollywood veterans Eddie Murphy and Danny Glover. This film was based on the Broadway play which debuted back in 1981. My earliest memory of DREAMGIRLS was the play,when I was a high school freshman back in 1985-86,I remember three black female students from my chorus class,rehearsed several numbers and performed them in either our Christmas concert or Spring concert. If you love soul music,you'll love this film.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|Ok look ,i'm a drummer and have been a rush fan for the last 25 yrs .i've seen rush every tour twice in 25 yrs. <br />All i have to say is (and trust me it kills me)this cd is terrible.No big hooks ,no songs to make you say Wow! that was cool.just plain boring vanilla.Iwasn't happy about their last \\"cover\\"album and was hoping this was something that would make up for that.I literally listened to this cd 6 times already and had to force myself to get through it.I even called other friends who are huge fans and they agreed.What happened?????????I use to love every song from start to finish.Sorry but, it really hurts me to say that this is just bad.it's sad looks like i'll just keep going with dream theater and just discovered procupine tree .these guys are cool! <br /> <br />to the past rush fans who just gave rave reviews c'mon are you serious????if you are rush fans you know this does not come close to anything they have ever done.
B000G75AE8|4.0|This is the first Slayer album I have owned. I bought it on a whim but I'm not unhappy that I did. The intensity of this record is amazing. The drumming is particularly remarkable. I really cannot believe that a human being can play that fast and accurately. The rest of the band are equally proficient with their instruments. Incredible energy throughout! My only 'issue' with the disc is the monomaniac lyrical subject matter. I get that they don't dig organised religion, but why go on and on about it? Why can't we have more songs like Eyes of the Insane, which is really cool and topical. This whole satanic thing is real dull and boring. I have other records by bands who are into satanism (Down, for one) but they at least mix it up a bit and also sing about other things (their love of weed, for example). Dudes, the music shreds but the lyrics are pretty juvenile for guys well into their 30s (judging by the pics). Other than that, it rocks.
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|Anyone can play football.This movie is about football. The people in this movie r in jail but not in real life. The guys in jail r going to play the gards in a game of football. The guys in jail get to practis on a dirt field kind of a desert looking sand field. Most of the fast people are black, which paule crew has to play one of them in a game of basketball.

B000BYA5G4|5.0|This movie surfaces the subject of illegal arms dealing. Yuri Orlov, played brilliantly by Nicolas Cage, finds his one true talent and with the assistance of his brother he sets out to purchase and sell weapons of all sorts. <br /> <br />From the depth of Ukraine immigrant status, Yuri Orlov reaches the top of his trade, supplying weapons to anyone and everyone interested in making a deal. <br /> <br />The movie is simply amazing. The cynicism of the dialogue leaves us pondering on, as Mr. Orlov says, the fact that a decent, honest job is done by too many people, with very thin margins, and yet, there are large fortunes to be made selling every kind of weapons he can get his amoral hands on.  <br /> <br />Since childhood, Mr. Orlov has been in love with a beautiful model and wherever he travels, as he sees the tabloids displaying her image, he focuses in someday possessing this \\"trophy wife\\" played by Bridget Moynahan. <br /> <br />At first, she is unaware of what he does for a living, and he convinces her that he is a millionaire in his own right, even though he has rented the plane he uses to take her away from a hotel where he had lured her under the disguise of photo opportunity. <br /> <br />Orlov's brother, played by Jared Leto, helps him to achieve his goals, but he is disturbed about the consequences of the trade they are in. As he sees countless victims die under the fire of the very weapons they sell, he finds refuge in his cocaine drug addiction, to mask the fact that he is an accomplice. <br /> <br />Yuri's cynicism is brilliantly played by Nicholas Cage, as he traffics in the death of thousands, the way other salesman might push vitamins or something good for humanity. <br /> <br />Some of the very cynical statements are left for the audience to ponder on the fact that \\"automobiles, alcohol and tobacco kill more people than weapons of all sorts.\\"  <br /> <br />Yuri Orlov travels all over the world, visiting a ruthless Liberian dictator, played by EamonnWalker, who acquires weapons to eliminate any citizen who opposes his oppressive regime. The son is riveted in obtaining Rambo's weapon and even this, Yuri Orlov is able to acquire for him. <br /> <br />In the end... when Yuri is put in jail, as he discusses his life with the man who has been after him throughout the film, he says... \\"My parents disowned me, my wife and child have left me... members of my family are dead... yes... I understand my situation.\\" The reply is priceless... for the persecutor says... \\"I would send you to hell, but you already live there!\\" <br /> <br />While incredible dark humor is at play with this movie, I would highly recommend this film, for it surfaces the dangers of the arms race, and the high price we pay as nations continue to build arsenals of destruction. <br />
B000JVT1U0|4.0|Anchor Bay's new double disk, which includes the cut American version and the restored 99 minute version, as well as both a doc and a commentary, is the one to own of this title. Too bad they didn't find the post credit sun god image mentioned below but no doubt that will come on the three disc set in the future.    The extended version is superior (the image loss on the sections taken from the tape is minor), the story less a mystery than a steady march to doom with a still shocking climax. The American cut works except the rearranging of scenes (after you've seen the original order) looks like the director botched it up. Blame Roger Corman (who did the recut).    When I first saw it I thought it was a rather vicious attack on Paganism (Fellini was more charitable in \\"Satyricon\\"); however on second viewing Christianity and religion in all forms are offered up for scrutiny and ridicule. It is a shame that such a daring film had such a tortured path to the light. Not the first time. You would have thought Christian churches would have financed the distribution and shown it to summer camps.     Dead right is the liveliness of the music and celebration costumes and the wonderful amateur actors of the village, who seem to be having such a good time playing such a preposterous game. It figures that a director who could get that right wouldn't work again for twelve years.    Sidenote: Britt Eckland, then married to Rod Stewart, incurred his wrath with her nudity (sometimes doubled). And it lead to no film career for her either. She doesn't display much talent but certainly enhanced the film, pity it turned out so badly for her. And for everyone involved until the past five years.
B000O1799U|4.0|I rented this movie mostly to see Jennifer Hudson.  Had been a fan of hers from American Idol and have only heard wonderful things about her performance in Dreamgirls.  I'd say America got it VERY wrong that she was booted; but who's laughing now, with a Golden Globe, an Oscar,etc, etc...      WOW!! The moment \\"Effie\\" stepped on screen, Jennifer put herself above the rest, in a league of her own.  And the minute she started singing... Words can't describe.  The power and strength of emotion that she was able to show, in just her eyes, when she sang \\"I'm Not Going\\"... I sat there speechless.  It was unbelievable.  In that moment alone, she was worthy of all the accolades.  I haven't seen an experienced actress, let alone an actress in her DEBUT performance, put that much emotion into a character EVER!!    I am in total awe of her talent- she has amazing strength and range in her voice.  I agree wholeheartedly with my fellow reviewer who said \\"Beyonce who??\\" (Though, I was surprised at her performance.  I didn't hate it.  The last couple of films she \\"acted\\" in, she was pretty horrible- Foxy Cleopatra...  But here, she was much better.  That said, she still couldn't steal the show from Jennifer.)    After about an hour and a half, the film started to drag for me.  The singing instead of talking out the lines was annoying, but that's a musical for you.  The soundtrack is amazing.  There are MANY many strong, amazing vocals.      Overall, a powerful story about beating the odds, rising into stardom, the importance of true family and true friends, and not selling out your self along the way.  The real story is Effie White.  If for no other reason, watch this for Jennifer Hudson's performance.  Watch and be in awe of her amazing voice.  Kudos, Jennifer!!    P.S.  Just a fun tidbit.  In the very beginning, Jaleel White (better known as Steve Urkel from Family Matters) has an itty-bitty part.  Boy, it's weird seeing him period, but without the glasses or suspenders- it's hard to recognize him. lol =D
0743289412|1.0|I got about 175 pages into this book, when I just stopped out of sheer boredom and brought it back to the library. The fact that I didn't want to spend money on it should've told me something. And the one star I gave wasn't actually for the book. It was for me for holding on till page 175 and not throwing it out the window.<br /><br />I just couldn't get interested in any of these characters from page one and things didn't improve as the story went along. It may have gotten better further on into the book, but the way King was writing up to that point, I just didn't have the patience to hold on.<br /><br />What is wrong with King? He's done some good stuff here and there over the last few years, like \\"From a Buick 8\\", but by and large his work has been lacking some vital elements needed to pull you into the story. I don't what they are, but I know that they're missing.

B000069HZP|5.0|Nicholas Van Orton, a rather wealthy and successful man, played by Michael Douglas, is the sort of guy who wants to be... and is in control of all aspects of his life. <br /> <br />He likes order but his brother gives him a gift on his birthday that brings life as he knows it, to an abrupt end.  His brother, played by Sean Penn, has enrolled him in \\"The Game,\\" an experiential set of circumstances that progressively take Mr. Van Orton from rigid control of his surroundings to sheer chaos. <br /> <br />Michael Douglas is great as the rich, divorced, and lonely man, an investment banker, who... on his 48th birthday is haunted by the memories of a father who chose to commit suicide rather than confront life. <br /> <br />As the game starts, the company called CRS, or Consumer Recreation Services, involves Nicholas Van Orton in a series of events that bring him from anxiety to paranoia, to the depth of depression, through fear, anger, violence, seduction, and action... lots of action. <br /> <br />We are soon caught in the game, thrilled by the reality of what is happening to Van Orton, and horrified at the fact that everything around him appears to be so real. Van Orton's intelligence carries him through most of the impediments, but the apparent reality overwhelms him and at some point, he is simply out of control. <br /> <br />Michael Douglas is awesome as he conveys a sense of dread... of sheer panic that kept us riveted on his every move. Would highly recommend seeing this film, especially if you like solving puzzles... getting scared... in a world where everything is simply... out of control. <br />  <br />
B000B5XOSO|4.0|That's why only the 4 stars cause I believe this movie is great.  However, why is there no grey lettering and outline?  It looks like this is the same movie from the \\"Legacy\\" collection, rather than the Special Editions.  I wouldn't want to order this and get the single disk edition.  So my question is, which version is this?
B00003CX9E|4.0|I am 62, and \\"Citizen Kane\\" has been hyped as the world's greatest film all of my life. I finally saw it for the first time when I was about 20, and even though I was in college earning a degree in journalism, and this is a movie partly about the journalism of the early 20th century, it really did not live up to the build-up. I viewed it again around the age of 40, and appreciated it a bit more. Finally, I watched it  again last week, and totally enjoyed it...the writing, acting, directing, odd style of story-telling, crazy camera angles, and all. When I was in college, a popular book was \\"Citizen Hearst\\", a biography of William Randolph Hearst, who Orson Welles was satirizing with his Kane character. Kane and Hearst share many traits in common, but the movie is not a thinly disguised biography of the Rupert Murdoch of his era. It is a work of fiction, a study of a man whose personality was shaped when he was a heart-broken boy, and whose inherited wealth led him to glory, power, even more wealth, and finally ruin. As is mentioned in the film, \\"Charles Foster Kane wanted to be loved\\" but he didn't know how to get it except through purchase or pandering. Don't worry if it does not knock your socks off the first time you see it. It is the kind of film that a person who has lived long enough to have a few big failures, and a success or two, will appreciate more.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This film benefits from a presentation that has been refined and developed by it's presenter Al Gore for over 20 years.<br /><br />It's visual presentation by reknowned director Davis Guggenhiem is spotless.<br /><br />There is a sense of incisive modernism to the direction, and it casts what is essentially a powerpoint file accompanied by Gore's gently witty narrative into sharp focus.<br /><br />For me, the most powerful aspect of this project, aside from the crushing facts of global warming, is Gore's selfless dedication to his topic. He quotes Winston Churchill at one point, and appropriately, because like Churchill, Gore's moral universe is simplified by one unassailable fact - he has a mission, and he will not ever stop working at it.<br /><br />There is a tendency to criticise a film of this kind by creating doubt about a detail of it. For example, why is Gore seen in the film in a number of vehicles including helicopters, whilst preaching that we should all lower our carbon emissions? And the fairly overt shots of Apple laptops seem a little insidious when coupled with the knowledge that Gore is a director on the board of Apple computers.<br /><br />To criticise in this way though is really missing the forest for the trees. A man does not devote himself to an issue with this much passion for 4 decades just to draw attention to himself, and anyone looking into Gore's eyes can tell that he means what he says. Gore is far from an attention seeker; his presentation is a very sophisticated attempt to blast through the barriers of doubt. In fact this film shows how he spends an almost equal amount of time studying doubt and how to tackle it, as he does researching the science itself.<br /><br />My only quibble with the film is most probably a fault of the producer/directors in the mercifully few moments where we step outside Gore's presentation to study Gore himself and the shards of his life which intersect with the issue of Global Warming.<br /><br />Although these moments are in their own way, powerful and sympathetic, they also form a platform upon which the film can be superficially criticised (ie that he's just trying to draw attention to himself after losing an election, or that he's attempting to politicise science etc) and moronic as these criticisms may be, the film was better off not entering into the personal realm of Gore in my opinion. That could perhaps be another film. This film is and must be soley about the Earth, and the problem that confronts it.<br /><br />In short, this is a powerful, deeply human experience and one that leaves it's audience immediately inspired to do what we can for our beautiful home. I hope it is seen by as many people as possible and that they open their hearts and minds to it.etic, they also form a platform upon which the film can be superficially criticised (ie that he's just trying to draw attention to himself after losing an election, or that he's attempting to politicise science etc) and moronic as these criticisms may be, the film was better off not entering into the personal realm of Gore in my opinion.

0316113077|5.0|Finally, the book we've all been waiting for is out.  I've seen Elisa interviewed and do demonstrations and seen her work, and now some secrets are out and helpful hints and stunning pictures are all in this great book. <br />For some people, I imagine you'd want to dive right in and begin/attempt to recreate some of the fabulous cakes in here (I personally don't think I even have half the skill to try), but whether you want to try and make them or just admire her fantastic work, this book is spectacular. <br />For each recipe, there is a complete list of what you need (materials, equipment, and techniques etc).  To me, I like simple, and this isn't.  It can be mind boggling if you aren't practiced in baking, but I can't stress enough how beautiful this book is, and it would make the perfect gift on Mothers day or for a birthday for anyone who loves baking, or just amazing and stunning looking cakes.  I love this. <br />
B00006EXDM|5.0|There's not much to add about the immense quality of the basic stereo versions of these songs.  They are all immortal.  However, this DSD (similar to SACD) brings out the subtle (and not so subtle) highs and lows of all tracks by accenting their high quality.  Be aware that this is DSD and NOT SACD.  It has to have the SACD logo to be SACD.  That being said, you've never heard so clear a version of, \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" or \\"Wild Horses\\".  The most fantastic version is of, \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" which not only sounds like the first time you heard it - it sounds like they are in your living room!  I jest not!
B00005JNS0|4.0|I am 62, and watched \\"Cars\\" with my granddaughter Brianna, who is seven. She liked it, but I enjoyed it more. Although I am a fan of open-wheel Indy car and Grand Prix racing, not NASCAR, it was a hoot following Paul Newman's character, a crusty retired former champion car. I think the movie is over the heads of most kids Brianna's age, and a bit too long for anyone younger, but its failures are minor compared to its achievements. It teaches lessons in humility and in perserverance and in the rewards of doing the right thing even if it costs you something you really want.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|I LOVE this album. Honestly I feared that this album would not be good at all becaue the first was such a hit...which happens with many bands out there.I love every song on the album and they are very catchy beats and Alex Turner does not disappoint! Has got to be the best album I have bought this year.
B000NVIXFK|1.0|Rush, I like the theme, but you need to change.  You must write lyrics and music simultaneously so that there is actually a cohesive groove to your music.  What is wrong?  It is all to obvious that most of your songs are lyricized first and then music FORCED into it after the fact.  You cannot write lasting music that way.  There is no melody-lyric-rhythm groove here that will ever be remembered.  Sorry, change your writing method or you will continue to make forgetable albums to oblivion.  You used to have a groove, you no longer do.  You can have all of the musicianship in the world and not be able to write a SONG.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I cannot comment on the other languages, but the Latin pronunciation used is not the classical Latin pronunication probably in use at that time.  It is a later pronunciation widely used by the Roman Catholic Church and characteristic of versions of Latin that became the Romance languages.      Although this is a remarkable dramatic work, even believers may need to be reminded that it is still merely a movie, representing or dramatizing, but of course not recording, real events, including Jesus' resurrection, just as a movie about, say, Lincoln's assassination would depict, but cannot actually record, real events of 1865.  Dramatic representations of the Passion are so commonplace that one would easily feel encouraged to think of it as myth and to forget that it all actually happened, in just one way, as real events do happen.  No photographs survive, not because there was no scene to be photographed, but because photography came along some 1830 years later.  However obvious this may be, I fear that it needs to be said.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|This, along with United 93, was one of the two best movies I saw last year, and I am picky and do not get to see all that many. Nick Cage is good, but his co-star steals the show. As with the United 93 film, the protagonists do not know what caused the day's tragic events, what was happening elsewhere, or whether their precarious situations would have any wider meaning than just to themselves and their loved ones. Oliver Stone turns in a restrained, non-conspiracy, non-paranoid, non-obscene, and oddly, a nearly non-violent work of art here. A lot of it is filmed in the dark, with only the heads and maybe one hand visible on each actor, and with dialogue hampered by their injuries and desperate situation. Yet it is quite powerful, and to me, a total success.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|For me Rush was at their peak from \\"Power Windows\\" to \\"Roll the Bones\\", four albums of clean power rock with lots of hooks.  Not that I didn't treasure some of the earlier stuff, and a greatest hits CD and the aforementioned CD's comprise one heck of a playlist, maybe supplemented by some live stuff, especially the excellent \\"Show of Hands\\".  Unfortunately I haven't been able to add anything to the playlist since.  The later CD's displayed fine musicianship, but the muse had fled, the songs simply weren't compelling.<br /><br />Sometime later after the band basically ceased to be for personal reasons, here's one more try at the brass ring.  The problem is that the band hasn't had a linear progression, they haven't grown as a group into new music, and this CD shows them essentially trying to recapture the past.  With some success, there are moments here that work, offset by the trademark Rush choppiness in song writing (someone said Rush sounds like they assemble songs from individual parts, so true).  Even when they sound good, like in parts of \\"Armor and Sword\\" and \\"Good News First\\", the only really solid songs here, it's so . . . old and familiar.  Is there really justification for adding another song to \\"Presto\\"?  Just because they can still manage it?  I don't know, maybe that's what the true believers want (or an even older sound maybe).<br /><br />If that was it, they basically pull off a repeat of one of the glory albums, that might be enough for me too.  But they don't, there are too many songs here that are hookless and drifting, and a lot of noodling around almost as filler.  The band sounds pretty good, just a little tired maybe, so there could be some hope that they stay together and find a new sound to push into, something to revitalize the songwriting.  But that's very rare, for a band to lose the ability to write hooks and then find it again.  I'm not very encouraged that Rush is going to find their second wind based on the evidence of this CD.
B00000IQCA|5.0|Why all the hate for FEADY TO WEAR?  Like many of you, I was underwhelmed when it first came out but now thanks to constant showings on the Sundance Channel and all those channels in that narrow band of indie cable, it has been growing on me and now I can't stop watching it.  Barbara Shulgasser's writing is wonderful, and if it has been chopped up like cole slaw by Altman's fitful direction, and by the generally improvisatory style embodied by Kim Basinger's steamrolling fashion reporter, it is still Altman who gives the picture its life, its joie de vivre.  And the fantastic outfits are to die for, each one crazier than the last.<br /><br />Sophia Loren is so over the top in this one role that retrospectively her entire career takes on a veneer of camp Carlo Ponti could never have intended.  If she was Elton John her sunglasses couldn't get any vaster, like two TV screens perched on her nose, and her breasts bobbing like apples in the tub of her sausage cased cleavage deserve equal billing with Mastroianni, who perhaps overdoes his sad sack clown persona.  Together they're not so much fun as you'd think, but she's great.  Is there any black satin left in the world or was all of it used for her widows' wear!<br /><br />My favorite, Anouk Aimee, gets all the drama parts.  Why didn't Altman use Anouk Aimee more, she is simply the most striking and hawklike actress who ever lived!  She and Rupert Everett as her avaricious son are playing out whole 3 decker Balzac novels with their back and forth, their mutual accusations of greed and contempt.<br /><br />OK, there are some inanities to READY TO WEAR, and I'm never sure if Forest Whitaker isn't laughing up his sleeve or revealing new previously unknown dimensions to his private life, but all in all it is a movie for the ages, and my favorite by Altman (except for NASHVILLE and A WEDDING).  Maybe its angle about fashion being stupid is itself pretty banal, but you know, I just don't care any more.  If it's on, I'll watch it all the way through and I'll cry when it's over, just like Julia Roberts pretending her lost luggage hasn't yet been delivered to her closet.watch it all the way through and I'll cry when it's over, just like Julia Roberts pretending her lost luggage hasn't yet been delivered to her closet.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I've been a Rush fan since 1982, the Moving Picture/Signals time frame.  While I dont love all the songs on this new album, there are several great tracks on Snakes and Arrows.  Its hard to believe that these guys have been make studio albums for 33 years now, and they can still produce an album of this quality.  I have one gripe, though.......Why couldn't they have made Malignant Narcissism a longer song?  I absolutely love it  I start bouncing in my chair here at work listening on my head phones!!  It needs to be longer than 2:17.  But seriously, if you are a Rush fan, you'll love this new album.
B000M4RG42|3.0|I read the book twice in recent years, so I was much better prepared for the movie than most in the audience. I think familiarity with the book is essential in this case. Eastwood tries to tell too much, I think, and the flashbacks get annoying eventually. While Adam Beach as Ira Hayes was fine, there could have been two films here: the heroic struggle for that damn island, and a sequel about the exploitation of the surviving flag-raisers. Two separate 90-minute movies, along with the third part of the trilogy, \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\", giving the Japanese point of view, would have worked better. Still, this battle was ferocious and deserves to be honored for more than the 15-seconds of flag-raising on the fifth day of a 36-day fight. Read the book first, then see the DVD, if you are interested at all in the next-to-last great battle of the Pacific War.
B000002UAX|5.0|Amazing. Absolutely brilliant.  <br /> <br />There are a couple of tracks I skip, just because Rocky Racoon, Piggies, and Revolution 9 scare the hell out of me. (What were those boys thinking?!) <br /> <br />The Beatles never cease to amaze me. For the 6 years they were world famous, each album is a piece of absolute brilliance. The White album, in my opinion, is the greatest album ever made. Front to back, it's flawless; the creepy songs adding to the album's intensity and ground-breaking influence on pop culture. It proves, once again, that the Beatles not only defined rock and roll music of the times, but they also personified it.   <br /> <br />Need I say more?
B000007489|4.0|I just recenty heard of this band from a friend of mine.  I am now hooked on Suicidal Tendencies.  Even tho I was like 1 year old when this album came out.  Do yourself a favor and buy it, you want regret it.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|This is the best Bond movie and by a good margin.  The story is action packed, but gritty and more realistic than past Bond movies.  Craig is the first believable Bond, he has just the right mix of ruthlessness, arrogance, humor, and charm.  Blu-Ray picture quality is excellent.  This movie would have been nearly perfect if not for all the blatant Sony product placement.  Every time they showed a Sony laptop, cell phone, Blu-Ray player, etc. I was jarred out of immersion in the movie and reminded that I was just a mindless drone meant to soak up marketing like a sponge.
B000CNESU8|4.0|I saw \\"Network\\" the other night for the first time since I was in a theater audience at the time of its original release. I was very pleased that it gave me a couple of hours of fine entertainment. I had forgotten just enough to make it seem fresh again. Sadly, one thing you learn from the movie after what, 30 years, is that network television isn't any more moral than it used to be: \\"Network\\" focuses on a blurring of the lines between \\"news\\" and \\"entertainment\\" and on the creation of \\"reality\\" shows. Alas, all that has come to pass. Thank goodness for the proliferation of cable channels, where one can choose documentaries, history, politics, classic films, and even horse racing instead of O'Reilly and Hannity and \\"Survivor\\" and the like. In this film, William Holden was the voice of morality and dignity, Faye Dunaway was hot but obsessed with her job, Peter Finch was enjoying being a star, pretending to take himself seriously, and Beatrice Straight demonstrated that a woman could win a supporting actress Oscar with only five minutes on screen if she and the writing were good enough.
B000O178BY|5.0|Listen to this record a few times before you pass judgment.  At first I was appalled to hear that Trent made a political anti bush record (I despise ALL politicians regardless of parties).  Even listening to it the first time, I thought...why would he do this?    The second time through, I paid more attention to the music and what he is trying to do.    The third time through, I got it.  Pay attention to what he is telling you through the music.  His message is not about the state of geo-political nonsense.      The message is about you.  All the songs together are about what's inside of you.  It is your own hand that is reaching from the heavens and shaping your life.    Whereas his past songs have been very angst filled and in your face, and moaning about his ex girls and drugs and abuse, here he is telling you a story and you need to pay attention.  He is doing it without screaming in your face and frankly with much less profanity than he is used to.  This may be by design so he gets his message out to a wider play audience.    I think this record is a perfect continuation from With Teeth because the last song on With Teeth is about looking at yourself and being afraid of what you might see in the mirror...now he is telling you what is actually there, whether you like it or not.    **UPDATE - Be sure to have your windows down, subs pumping hard in your car and you can feel the energy that you are creating.  Lots of magic worked with bass and I must say that the bass is very clean sounding.  The bass actually makes the music rather than just being a typical thud thwap thump that a lot of rap artists go for.    If you aren't listening loud, then you aren't paying attention, and I will report you to the US Bureau of Morality...
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I've been looking forward to this for quite a while and I haven't been disappointed.  Is it the greatest Rush album ever?  No, but it's a very solid effort from a group of musicians that continue to change and explore new areas every single album. <br /> <br />Overall, S&A is a lot slower paced that most Rush albums- they can still rock out if they want (the stellar single Far Cry) but much of the album feels more relaxed and introspective.  Tunes like The Larger Bowl, Faithless and Bravest Face take a look around the world and don't always like what they find.  The 3 instrumental tracks are some of the best on the album- consummate musicians simply playing what they feel like.  (Ergo the wonderfully titled Malignant Narcissism)  My only real criticism is that the album feels a bit disjointed- with the lead off Far Cry you expect a different album than what comes later, and it seems to shift tempo and tone too frequently. <br /> <br />The production on this album is *vastly* better than on Vapor Trails.  It sounds clean and precise throughout- you don't lose any of the subtle guitar tricks or drum backing in the wall of noise so common on their previous album <br /> <br />I think a lot of the negative reviews are by folks who keep hoping they'll return to the good old days.  (Which good old days is another story- 2112?  Moving Pictures?)  They are in their mid-50s now, but they are still amazingly technically proficient.  They've been playing music for decades, have done basically everything a rock band can do. have been through personal highs and tragedies, and I can't imagine they need the money anymore.  Why on earth would you think they'd produce an album like those in the past?   <br /> <br />Finally, I was amazed by the review that thought the lyrics, especially Faithless were too negative.  Not even close- Faithless is an anthem for us atheists/agnostics/humanists/skeptics.  It has without a doubt the most uplifting lyrics of any Rush tune in ages.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|This new album from the Chilis has some good moments and some not so good moments. I have listened to the whole thing twice and i like 16 of the 28 songs. The album seems to really run out of steam on the second disc when the vocal melodies of Kiedis and Frusciante's guitar riffs seem to blend into the next song and nothing really stands out. They start sounding like a lukewarm radio rock band and sound a bit cliched. The Chilis are a great band and i liked californication and By The Way but i think this album suffers from a lack of quality control. The whole point of doing double albums is normally to broaden out and experiment, and try things that the band has not done before. Most of the great double albums like the White Album by The Beatles, Mellon Collie and the infinite sadness by the Smashing Pumpkins or London Calling by The Clash do this, they take creative risks which manage to hold the listeners attention. Unfortunately on this album the Chilis only have a couple of experimental songs like If. Most of the album is a mix of Californian pop ballads, light rock and some funk and basically offers nothing that the Chilis haven't already done better on previous albums. Having said that the album is good, the first 8 songs on the first disc are all good, but the album gets a bit patchy after that point. One of the major problems is Kiedis's vocals are a bit uninspired and the lyrics are random with nothing very interesting or evocative to say, so a lot of these songs sound a bit samey after a while. However, there are good songs on here and the album is worth buying if you're a Chilis fan and if the 16 best songs were on one disc this would be a 4 star album.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|No need to write a long review on this albulm. When you buy it you'll experience something great. I'm a jazz saxophonist of 13 years and I think I have a good ear when it comes to vocals and big band support. This CD is certainly an excellent example of vocal, instrumental marriage. Michael is diving more and more into the jazzy \\"rat pack\\" scene with his tantalizing vocals supported by that immaculate, flawless big band. Michael's voice is airily reminiscent of the great Frank Sinatra. This CD is great and is certainly a must buy. THE BIG BAND IS ON FIRE!!!!!!!!
B000002ILG|2.0|The guitar solo in White Lion's \\"Wait\\" is a LIMP-WRISTED DINOSAUR. It's a blast of subconscious femininity spewed to the surface by its steel-eyed, steel-toed creator, Italian Long Islander Vito Bratta. Its sweep-picked dips and launches are as fluid as milk on moisturized spine tissue, its bendy hammer-ons as eerily scraped clean of excess noise as a Svenson silencer. It makes the man who was undoubtedly Bratta's greatest influence, Eddie Van Halen, sound like the sloppiest spank maven of all time. Even the opening finger-tapping on \\"Hot For Teacher\\" has traces of misplaced pick-induced grit and grime. This solo is more sterilized than a Norwegian maternal ward. It's a major-key lite-toned crystal clear hang-gliding ascent towards hair metal heaven, where all the glammy apostles freely accept the most feminine aspects of their genre, without resorting to horrifically homophobic cover-up a la Sebastian Bach of Skid Row (not even Axl Rose had the gall to don an \\"AIDS Kills F**s Dead\\" shirt on live TV). Bratta's solo inadverdently begs all metaldom to embrace the tender and shun the hedonistic. <br /> <br />And why not? After all, the song is one of the most disgustingly sincere metal ballads of all time, with lyrics like \\"Wait, wait, I never had a chance to love you.\\" Released in 1988, the same year an onslaught of more well-received (yet no more substantive) glam ballads such as \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\" and \\"Don't Know What You Got 'Till It's Gone\\" hit international airwaves, \\"Wait\\" bears a positivity, an angelic wholesomeness, that places it in a slightly different league than its ilk. This song isn't lamenting an affair or love gone bad; its narrator is merely asking his love interest to be a little more patient, and you know from all the triumphant chanting that she'll concede. <br /> <br />White Lion played \\"gee whiz\\" metal. They were guilty of all the same glam posturing as their peers; guitarists playing back-to-back, scarf on the mic stand, three members sharing a mic, a singer more splashy than Joan Jett and Uma Thurman's potential love child. What set them apart from the others was their purity, their love of monogamy and harmony. After all, their second single was an ode to those heart-wrenching moments \\"When The Children Cry.\\" Sex and booze are noticeably missing from their videos. And Bratta's solo, all white-furred lynx preening and cream acrobatics, is a paean all its own, the patron saint of altruistic heavy metal.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I love reading the varied reviews on this latest RUSH disc.  Either you love it or you just hate it.  Basically, it's coming down to two sides of the camp.  The pre-Hemispheres fans, the pre-Grace Under Pressure fans and then thereafter.  The die hard fans would have 2112, Caress of Steel, or Hemispheres, etc for every single album.  That just doesn't work and bands don't last with the same exact sound for each outing.  With each release I would hope that each fan would want a different type of album.  While I can appreciate the more progressive feel of early RUSH I can also appreciate the latest sound of RUSH.  Although this does border on the sound of Vapor Trails I won't decry it until I've listened to it for awhile.  Vapor Trails and even Test For Echo took me a long time to thoroughly enjoy after much listening.  But then again, Permanent Waves and Hemispheres took me a long time to actually enjoy.  And while some reviewers ridicule this cd then you might be the one's who also were shocked when Permanent Waves came out with the radio friendly 'The Spirit of Radio'.  If that wasn't a sell-out by RUSH to commercial radio then I don't know what was.  I remember when I first heard it I just hated that song because after listening to RUSH, Caress of Steel, Fly By Night, 2112 back in the day and 'All the World's a Stage' I just wanted more of the same.  But,unfortunately, that's not the case with musicians who want to grow in their respected fields.  So, although this might not be their best cd to date according to you, at least the band is still making music.  The bottom line is that the band is happy with this release.  Just like with Genesis and their very commercial releases with Phil Collins it was a band decision with each album that was made.  Whether or not the fans were happy has always been a matter of much debate.  Take a listen and be open to the sound of a great rock album, not a progressive masterpiece of yesteryear. Stand-out track so far for me would be 'The Larger Bowl'.  The addition of the acoustic guitar in the majority of songs gives this cd a different touch even if it's in unison with the electric guitar and even with the overdubbing of Geddy Lee on backing vocals it doesn't detract from the cd.  If you see them in concert Alex then takes the reign of back-up vocalist and you have to wonder if he actually does the back-up vocal duties on their cd's.  Who knows and what's done in the studio to what is actually played on tour are different anyway for the most part and you expect that.  So, don't trash this on expectations of 20-30 years ago.  If you do, you will be sorely disappointed. For all the negative reviews, they just aren't warranted.  After many listens I would to lean more towards this being a exceptional release that is much better than Test For Echo and Vapor Trails all the way around.be 'The Larger Bowl'.

B000LC55F2|5.0|This is a great movie for movie lovers that love to keep their eyes glued to the screen. This is not a movie you can put on while doing other tasks. It demands your full attention so you don't miss a thing. Lots of twists and turns in the story to keep you watching for what happens next.
B000O75F7C|3.0|I guess I'm not the die hard fan that some of you are based on the reviews.  I've listened to this and this release just doesn't blow me out of the water.  It's the same vocal styling by Steven Wilson that can heard in Blackfield and even No Man.  That just gets redundant.  It's like Geddy Lee or even Steven Tyler screaming on each song back in their day that you expected to hear on each album.  I'm beyond that and like a little variation and I just don't see that here.  The sound that Wilson creates is the same no matter where he goes.  So, beat me up for this review which is fine because that's what music is all about, personal taste.  Either it's your cup of tea today or it's not.  Maybe next time.  Cheers!
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I was experiencing a logical disconnect with my original disappointment in this album (see original review below).  Snakes & Arrows is Rush, and therefore should be completely awesome.  However, I found the album somewhat wanting.      Then I figured it out.      When I saw the songs performed live (MSG on September 17, 2007), they TOTALLY ROCKED.  I came away with a completely new appreciation for the album.  All I found lacking in the musical aspect of the album was totally blown away by that one concert.  I even liked \\"Spindrift\\", which I had found particularly grating. It may just be that a mere CD cannot contain the awesomeness that is Rush.  And that could be why Rush felt this was their best album to date (which had some fans scratching their heads)--they were hearing it LIVE as they recorded it.  Had I first heard the music live, I might have felt the same way.      Do I still have some issues with the album?  Sure.  I think Neil's lyrics are particularly depressing and fatalistic this time around (can \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" really have been written by the same man who gave us \\"Everyday Glory\\"?!), and if the songs are only one-hundredth as good on the CD as they are live, that's an engineering or production problem, I think.      So if you are a fan who found this album somewhat disappointing, I can completely sympathize--and encourage you to get tickets next time they come around.  It'll completely change your outlook.  I promise. :)    -----  Original Review:  As eagerly as I anticipated this album, I am rather disappointed by my first run-through.  None of the tracks really grabbed me.  Snakes and Arrows features some musical snippets that really could have BEEN something under the right direction (I kept waiting for those melodies to swell and transform into something incredible, I could hear it there under the surface!), but in the end was not particularly remarkable.      I think lack of energy is really the big fault of this album.  As I listened tothe somewhat plodding tempos and similar-sounding songs, the only thing running through my mind was the opening bars of \\"Force 10\\".  THAT has power and force and passion and makes you want to DO something, express yourself, revel in the joy that they create with their music.  And for heaven's sake, when you see them live...whoo!      However, the album is still Rush and therefore worth your time.  Neil's lyrics (and use of a pantoum) are very HIM, as usual (can't put it any other way!), and although Geddy seems to have acquired a somewhat excessive fascination with layering his own voice over the past few albums, his bass playing is second to none and he sings well.  Alex, perhaps inspired by his success with the opening theme to \\"Andromeda\\", provides us with a fun, quirky little instrumental all his own that is less like \\"Victor\\" than one might have feared.      Even if Snakes and Arrows is not one of Rush's best, I will of course give the album many many more listens.  A ruby among diamonds is still precious, no?
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I have to comment on this album. Being a long time Rush fan, and after listening to Vapor Trails (not my favorite album by a stretch) I thought Rush may had actually run out of good new material. But boy was I wrong, this album is so fresh and yet flavored with classic Rush sound, that it blew me away! They have risen up to make a fantastic piece of work here that I know die hard Rush fans will enjoy more than Vapor Trails by a looooooooooooooooong shot! What I have noticed with almost every Rush album is that, there seems to be at least a few \\"filler\\" type songs (I hate to say it) on every one of them, songs that are so weak, I can't even listen to them even once in their entirety. But I'm going to say that every song on this album is very, very good if not amazing in it's sound and construction. Alex has really stepped up his game and added some guitar sounds like he has never done before. Geddy is really tight on the bass and has also ventured into some \\"rif\\" oriented sounds unlike any I have heard before. Neil is simply Neil, and shines as he always does. Together, they have produced an album that to this long time Rush listener, has to rank amongst their very, very best of all time!
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Today I read a review of Snakes & Arrows on the CANOE.ca website and I think the author put it best in describing Rush as a band that always acts its age.  So it shouldn't surprise anyone that the lyrics and sounds with each subsequent album have evolved and reflect the life experiences, interests and concerns of the band.  That this new album isn't 2112 is no surprise to me and it is really perplexing that others expected it to be or even wanted it to be as such.  These guys are not 20 years old anymore.  They may still be interested in sci-fi and themes seen in their younger work, but they have grown up, evolved into more complex adults who I'm guessing have many other concerns and have been influenced by life, politics, art and other music.  I can totally relate to that.  I like this album.  It takes the feel and chord progressions from older Rush albums but projects them into the future--there's that evolution theme--to show us the more advanced stages of these three excellent musicians.  I especially like The Way the Wind Blows and Faithless.  The lyrics are also very thoughtful and intricate, as always.  The musicianship is also brilliant, still evolving and improving which we expect from these guys.  It seems the people who criticize this album because it doesn't sound like the older albums from this or that Rush era have forgotten that you can never go back.  All they would need to do is look at their own lives to realize this is true.  So why would you require this of Rush?
B000HC2LI0|5.0|First off, while one can't judge a series, either on broadcast of DVD, by its packaging, Warner Home Video pulled out all the stops for the complete series edition.  A dispatch box is a great way of presenting one of the seminal political TV shows ever, and putting the early seasons on single-side DVD, although a small thing, was a wise choice. <br /> <br />But packaging isn't what makes me buy a series collection.  It's the series itself, and here's where \\"The West Wing\\" was strongest - writing.  Aaron Sorkin is the KING of brilliant plotting and dialogue, and this series puts it all on display.  The first three seasons - where Sorkin was most involved - were strong on character, plot, and snappy, witty dialogue, even when the overall story faltered or the plotlines were too gimmicky.  Nobody has this much on their plate when they don't seek out conflict - an assasination, war scares, assorted horrors - and if they do, there's bound to be a flummox along the way. <br /> <br />The strange thing is that \\"The West Wing,\\" like Sorkin's \\"The American President,\\" is smart but a little too idealistic with the main characters.  Sure, President Jed Bartlet is a caring, cautious, even, dare I say it, dignified, president, but he's been around the maypole long enough to know that deals have to be done.  Martin Sheen delivers a nuanced performance - easy I guess because the politics of his character mimic his real-life ones.  The pragmatic voice-on-his-shoulder, Leo McGarry, done by the ever brilliant John Spencer (we had him for only a short time on the \\"must have\\" list for character actors before he died), was the only voice of pragmatism in Bartlet's White House. <br /> <br />I agree with other assessments that the series really suffered when Sorkin left.  His creative hand made the \\"Wing\\" the hit it was early on, and they struggled mightily after he left.  However, the show was bigger than it's creator, much as it was bigger than its ensemble cast (Moira Kelley and Rob Lowe must kick themselves every day when they think of how willingly they bailed on a hit show).  The series struggled to recapture its lustre in the later seasons, but they did hit stride again when, in a burst of daring reality, decided to end the show after Bartlet's two terms were up.  We've seen before how producers and networks, unwilling to let a hit go, despite knowing the best years are behind them, thus force a good show to die a death of mediocrity.  However, John Wells and Tommy Schlamme (the second creative genius on this project) brought their best work into showing a realistic election campaign while allowing us to see a bittersweet ending of a career that would be equally missed in the real world, including the disintegration of a personal/professional relationship over a leak scandal, and the challenge of doing the right thing for the person when it comes to handing out a pardon (surely one of the hardest things a real president must do).  Thus, even without Sorkin, we see a good series save its best truly for last. <br /> <br />Wrapped up in all this, as expected, are some great behind-the-scenes goodness and additional materials exclusive for this edition (a reprint of the \\"Pilot\\" shooting script and essential episode guide) which add to both the series and the real world behind it.  Truly, this is well worth the price, which while considerable is much better in this set than buying all the boxes seperately.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|This is a good movie if you want to take your mind off stuff and focus on the positive. Loved this movie, but thought the premise that Amanda couldn't cry was rather stupid to say the least. And at the end, she tries real hard to cry, but she looks constipated, then the tears flow. Love Jack Black, but what was he doing in this film???  And did they drop the ball on Arthur? After his speech, they just ended up en England. Oh well, seeing the sexy Jude Law kind of made up for the stupid stuff:-)
B0006VIE4C|4.0|This review is not about the movie, but about the differences between the Jedi and the Sith. The Jedi only care about others and the Sith solely care about themselves is the main difference between the two groups. I know from watching this stuff that it has an impact on how I think. It's important for people to know that in order to be good you don't solely have to care about other people, you need to take care of yourself and then and only then you can take care of others. Imagine trying to do everyone else's homework and not getting yours done, whats doing to happen? Answer: you're going to overextend yourself and not do well in the course. There is a time for everything but you must take care of yourself to be prosperous and to be a blessing to others.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|The music on Snakes & Arrows is powerful.  From the galloping intensity of \\"Far Cry\\" to the subtlty of \\"Hope\\" (solo acoustic guitar) to the passion of \\"Faithless\\" to the incredible musicianship on \\"Main Monkey Business\\", it's all here.  Rush is not a Pop band.  They write intense, often dramatic music to go along with the lofty, philosophical topics that they sing about.  But that does not mean they don't know how to lay down beautiful, uplifting melodies and dynamics.  This album really conveys conviction, hope, desperation, anger and joy while singing about some of the big problems the world faces because of a militant, fanatical style of religious adherence.  Timely songs for a troubled time.  Rush is ALL HEART!!  Get this CD, make sure you can listen to it loud and prepare yourself to be taken away with melody, incredible drumming, incredible guitar work, lush arrangments and soaring vocals!   After many listens I have concluded that this is absolutely one of Rush's best albums.  You just have to give it a chance to sink in.  Just AMAZING!!
B00012QM8G|5.0|Riveting, captivating, emotionally charged from start to finish. One of the finest pieces of directing, acting by an ensemble cast including some of the most noted performances ever to grace the screen. Speilberg is a visionary giant, one of the greatest voices in the art of cinema that any generation will ever see.<br /><br />Pure, metaphysical bliss.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I'm a longtime Rush fan.  I always try to appreciate each new release as an essential chapter in the band chronicles, even if some don't find favor with my peculiar listening tastes.  I like all of their albums on some level, but I also find that some don't move me like 2112, Permanent Waves, Grace Under Pressure and Counterparts.  Roll the Bones is my least favorite; to my ears it lacks bottom end and weight both from the audio standpoint and the song formulae.  Hold Your Fire alternates between songwriting brilliance and far too many synths.  Test For Echo lacks memorable or crafty melodies and Vapor Trails sounds terrible.  Again, I love Rush and will always support them.  But for me some releases don't warrant alot of revisiting. <br /> <br />Snakes and Arrows, though I've only had time to listen once since I bought it, strikes me as a very strong effort.  I've been listening to Far Cry now since it was first available on iTunes and I have enjoyed it immensely:  Heavy guitars, a bizarre stomping intro riff and one of their most memorable chorus melodies of the last 20 years.  A great mix of classic guitar-driven Rush and their best songwriting efforts of the 90's, Far Cry serves to me as a represntative slice of Snakes and Arrows' appeal. <br /> <br />Much has been made of Alex's acoustic flavors on this album, and I would agree that they are in prominence and one of several reasons this disc stands on its own as a singular statement by the band.  For me, however, the strength of this release is the bold thematic statement running throughout Neil's lyrics.  Nearly every song ponders the question of faith and existence, and the strange and absurd juxtapositions of the modern cult of the supernatural and the harshness of life in the 21st (and to a metaphorical extent, the 7th) Century.  Taking cues from the intensely personal themes of crushing loss on Vapor Trails, Neil wears a heavy, sad and angry heart on his sleeve, skewering the idea of \\"faith\\" and the hypocrisy of religion as superstition.  Regardless of whether the listener agrees or not, the lyrics are bold and often pointed and adresses a social phenomenon with the poigniancy and strength of Presto's \\"The Pass\\" and the jarring clarity of Counterparts' \\"Nobody's Hero.\\" <br /> <br />The instrumentals are, as usual, excellent.  For my money, Main Monkey Business and Malignant Narcissism are better than any instrumental since Moving Pictures' YYZ.  They have a melodic strength and depth or hormony, with enough rhythmic happiness going on to please the Peart-worshippers and enough guitars to herald the triumphant return of Alex Lifeson, the tonal texture man.   <br /> <br />And, speaking of Alex, rumors that he is still holding out on guitar solos are unfounded and inaccurate.  True he is not soloing on every song but rather plays a solo in the service of the song.  There are several searing solos on this CD and a couple of them are the most fiery since his masterwork of pop guitar solos in Signals' \\"The Analog Kid.\\"  Not only has Alex found his inner folkie (his guitar instrumental \\"Hope\\" is wonderful), he has found peace with his recent, more solo-eschewing persona.  He has stripped his approach to a visceral basic with hints of blues and 60's riffage (with a nod to Feedback) and with that emphasis-shift reminded us why he is consistently rated near the top of the classic rock guitarists. <br /> <br />If you like Rush, you probably have no issues with Geddy's voice.  While I still have some issues with the vocal layering and harmonies that can detract from the overall product, my initial perception on Snakes and Arrows is that Geddy is making wiser choices about where and how to use the vocal harmonies; more often than not he is using his voice where synth pads used to reside in the mix, and when harmonizing with a melody the arrangements seem a bit more thoughtful and alot less intrusive.  Add to that a deepening richness and maturity in Geddy's vocal quality (check out the excellent \\"The Larger Bowl\\") and we have a vast improvement over Vapor Trails and Test For Echo. <br /> <br />In all, Snakes and Arrows, to me, stands as an excellent release and is the best Rush album since Counterparts.  Bold and bright sounding (easily the best SOUNDING Rush record in recent years), it will merit many repeat listening sessions.  Check it out.
B00000JSJC|1.0|since I cannot give this film a 'no' star, which clearly is what it deserves, it will garner a '1' star for the magical talent of Ray Fiennes. Despite that the film is non-stop boredom, fast paced 'huh's?' and a tendancy to leave the room multiple times, without being angry or irritated that you missed even a second of it. As a true fanatic of sci-fi (Andromedia Strain, Logan's Run, Clockwork Orange, 2001, 2010, Flatliners, Gattica, etc) I have to say, \\"what were they thinking?\\"<br /><br />This film is without question one of the worst movies ever made, and other reviewers that gave this four or five stars for its cinematic prose and appreciation to fine electrifying cinematic cultism, need to get their head examined, as they as movie goers were on their own drug induced-kinetic stupor while watching it.<br /><br />Written by James Cameron. Indeed, as bad as his help in rendering, yet again, the awful version that he threw together with Soderbergh of Solaris, and having Clooney play Mr. Klevin was disrespectful to Stanislaw Lem. Both, equally a waste of time, IMHO.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I'm really not sure where all of the negativity is coming from on Snakes and Arrows.  It's just a completely different sound and approach and perhaps this is just it.  It's what people aren't used to that they dislike I guess. I dunno.  If you look back on Rush's career, they've changed their sound and whole outlook about every four albums or so.  You've got the Rush through 2112 era, Kings through Pictures, Signals through Fire, you get the idea.  In recent years, Rush has gone on hiatus, devoting more time to develop personal interests of which, these experiences I think, have only added depth to their songs.  IMHO Snakes and Arrows shows just that.   <br /> <br />If you give the album (ok CD or... MP3s, so I'm dating myself) a chance, I think you can find some pretty good material in here.  Monkey Business is not a good song but a great one.  Wind Blows is also a very good, maybe great, solid tune.  Far Cry, though good, is sort of Rush's typical air play song but is a solid rocker.  I've taken a real liking to Workin' them Angels as it's got a really catchy chorus.  Malignant is good too and I only wish it were longer.  The rest are very good, solid songs and I think this collection deserves a spot right next to any other favorite album.  I've read some professional reviews which marvel at the wall of sound this album has.  How true.  It blows you away and you can hear every instrument distinctly, which of course is a Rush must.  Sorry Vapor Trails, you faltered on this one (hopefully remastered in the future??) <br /> <br />I'm glad Alex went back to some acoustical strings and I like the subtle keyboard touches in the songs.  And... the guys are really rockin' too, maybe more than they've done in twenty years or so.  Again, IMHO.   <br /> <br />I would really encourage any Rush fan to buy this album and to have others where it didn't grab them the first time, give it another listen.   <br /> <br />Should be good at the PNC Arts Center, NJ in July!! <br /> <br/> <br />
B000MR9D5E|4.0|Sometimes - maybe all the time, we humans forget that we're not the only earthlings. And like ants on a counter top, we are unable to take in the diversity and power of the life and geology around us. Planet Earth has taken on the challenge to awaken our senses, treat our eyes and ears and, explode our personal myths of the dominance of \\"man\\". The production and photography are amongest the best! Stunning, magnificent and breathtaking don't do the film justice. We have been glued to our seats as we've been introduced to animals and plants we've never seen and the familiar are even more amazing thanks to the tireless and often risky business of photography in the wilds. This production will become a classic because every aspect of the film has been carefully thought out - serendipity, not withstanding. You may not need to own this but you must see it.  <br />The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the producers just had to gratuitously throw in the most over done wildlife episodes seen on almost every wildlife program - the wildebeast crossing with the crocodiles, the wolf hunt, dog hunt, lion hunt, the shark \\"attack\\", etc., etc.  These could have been left out as everyone with access to a Tv has probably seen these ad nauseum.
0312360266|5.0|\\"Just when I thought my day couldn't get any worse, I saw the dead guy standing next to my locker.\\"<br /><br />The opening sentence hooks the reader; they will devour the whole book quickly and ask for more.<br /><br />Zoey's life is about to change forever. She woke up one morning normal and by the end of the day she's been marked. Being marked indicates that she will turn into a vampire. She needs to leave her family and friends behind and start a new life with other marked teens at the House of Night. Zoey's never completely fit in, but now she might have a chance.<br /><br />After a fight with her mother and stepfather, Zoey goes to her grandmother's house for advice. Before seeing her grandmother, Zoey has a vision of the Goddess Nyx, who states that she is special and names Zoey her personal eyes and ears in the world. Zoey faints, but not before the Goddess replaces her mark with a blue crescent, which is extremely rare.<br /><br />When Zoey arrives at the House of Night, she finds herself the object of attention because of her crescent. Her roommate and her new acquaintances quickly find their way into Zoey's heart. She finds herself surrounded with friends for the first time, but she also encounters a powerful enemy. As her entire lifestyle changes, Zoey finds peace within herself as she accepts her destiny and steps up to challenge her enemy's misguided judgement.<br /><br />If you like vampires and enjoy supernatural tales, you don't want to miss this first book in a great new series.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Jennifer Rummel
B000O75F7C|3.0|I eagerly anticipated the release of this CD for more of the great work this band has historically produced. I also wanted P.T. to contune evolving and this would be new material.  Not so.  Deadwing was better and going back to the compilation The Delerium Years was much better.  I can no longer relate to being a pill popping depressed teenager, thank goodness, so the lyrics don't hold a good deal of value to me.  The guitar work is as good as always but one cut seems to sound like the other.  I picked this up with Blackfield II and much prefer that CD.  I know the other reviewers are raving and I'll take the heat of knocking it down without saying which bar of which song justifies my disappointment...oh well, let 'er rip.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth is a trailblazing show from the BBC that has been five years in the making. The team that made this series went to every height necessary to make it, and their efforts paid off in dividends. \\"Planet Earth\\" is the most beautiful and educational series I've ever seen. It was made with everything from small handheld cammeras to satiliets orbiting the earth and everything inbetween. The series is broken up into many little segments. One segment follows African elephants as they travel across the African desert in search of water. One shows the bizarre mating customs of antarctic penguins,while another shows the stages of a hurricane. Everyone of these segments is filmed in beautiful first hand style. Part documentary, part biology class, part high class movie, \\"Planet Earth\\" is a film phenomena like nothing I've ever seen. The most enjoyable thing I took form \\"Planet Earth\\" is that it reminded me that even though I forget, there are still wild and beautiful places in this world and they bigger and more important that my first world problems. In the wake of the \\"Global Warming\\" scare, \\"Planet Earth\\" is a firm reminder of what could be lost because of our arrogance. The special features are also a treat. While most dvds will give you a couple 20 minute \\"making ofs\\" \\"Planet Earth\\" gives you an entire show about how they made this amazing achevement. Please watch this dvd. It may very well change your life.
B000BNX4MC|3.0|This is one of my all time favorite comedies. I remember watching it all the time when I was a kid and I still get a kick out of watching it now. So, your probably wondering why I only gave it 3 stars. I'm writing this review solely based on the special features. Like some other people have said, the special features on this edition is just ok. The one thing that really hurts this edition is the missing audio commentary by John Hughes, which can be found in the previous dvd release. Overall, an amazing movie with just so-so special features.
B000O178BY|5.0|It's not until the fifth track, \\"Vessel,\\" that one begins to appreciate just how sublimely crazy and dense Reznor's album is. I might not be able to understand the lyrics clearly through all the acidic, shifting buzz, but the cadence and snarling howl is classic NIN -- while the soundscape around him is magnetic, unsettling, enigmatic and sleek. He's been reading the newspapers, he doesn't like what he sees, and he is now going to give it to you with both barrels. And rock your face.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever used such descriptions when talking about an album, but it's just such a nimble and assured sonic experience that I am constantly amazed from one passage to the next. He's transcended his own sound and broken through to something chillingly propulsive. And I am fascinated at how he has finally, finally pulled free of the debilitatingly meticulous delivery that blunted his fire on admittedly strong releases like The Fragile and With Teeth. Year Zero is gloriously loose and inventive. From track to track, you can see he's knee-deep in a goldmine of inspiration, raining heavy nuggets down on the listener.<br /><br />Some artists find a great sound and drive it into the ground in successive albums. Others have a mid- or late-career snap of feverish inspiration, a purge of thought that finds a powerful musical channel that leads directly to the hindbrain. This is that place. If you don't get it, you're not listening loudly enough.
B000M06K5C|4.0|A bold claim I know, but I really believe it. I liked 'Silent Alarm' and think it's a great record, but this is just leaps and bounds beyond that, in great ways. As a few other reviewers have pointed out, this is truly an ALBUM, meant to be listened to as a coherent piece of work. The songs are incredible, and I think that it truly represents the state of British culture and youth better than anything since 'Ok Computer.' It also shares that albums sonic experimentation. The is hands down the best indie album of the year, and as a fan I am so excited to see where this band goes next!
0962477060|5.0|I have been teaching concepts from this book for 7 years now.  I still consistently have lessons where the students go \\"Ahhh, I get it now.\\"  Everything you need to know about organizing and understanding the fretboard is in this book.  The only drawback is, if you're not \\"ready\\" to understand it, then this book might be tough to get through. <br /> <br />If you: <br /> <br />1. are at a plateau and you have trouble telling someone what note you are on, or <br />2. you want to know how to connect all those scales together, or <br />3. you don't truely understand what I mean when I say \\"the CAGED system is one of the most powerful tools for any guitarist,\\" <br /> <br />Then, you need this book.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I've enjoyed Rush for years, but I'm definitely a fan of their early stuff. This album, much like Vapor Trails, just lacks the kind of energy and uniqueness Rush used to have. <br /> <br />Alex's guitar work is largely rythm these days. No more blistering solos, no incredible La Villa Strangiato, no more power songs like Working Man.  <br /> <br />Geddy's singing is as good as ever. If fact, his voice has aged incredibly well, losing a little of the high nasal and gaining some smoothness. Unfortunately, the songs are all so melodic his voice justs sort of cruises along. Nice, but not memorable.  <br /> <br />Neil still bangs out the percussion, though again, the songs lack any real punch, so you don't notice as much. <br /> <br />It's hard to describe what's missing. No energy, there's a sameness in quality/tone to most of the songs. There's the lack of distinctness between songs that Rush once had. Go back and listen to something like 2112 and then Snakes and the difference in sound is black and white. 2112 rises, falls, reaches crescendos, then mellows. It's an auditory ride. Snakes is more like a slow, and largely boring, trip down the freeway on cruise control.
0618680004|4.0|If you share Einstein religious beliefs and/or enjoyed reading books from Carl Sagan, Stephen Hawking, R. Dawkins, Paul Davies and the like, then you will probably enjoy this book. But, if you are very sensible at your religious beliefs, you better skip this book, because you might end up really offended and upset, because this book is a crude attack on all religions, and especially to Christianity. Dawkins tries hard during the first half of book to demonstrate that God does not exist, openly and in a rational way, and then he goes into religion nonsense practices and beliefs. I don't fully agree with him; however I really enjoyed his critic (attack) on religious traditions and especially on the U.S. religious conservatives that are pushing the Intelligent Design \\"Theory\\" to be taught at school (creationism as opposed to evolution). Really a great work on this subject!<br /><br />Also I found very interesting his historical analysis of the American Founding Fathers and especially on Jefferson ideas regarding the dangerous mix of politics and religion, and why a separation must exist. Everybody should read at least that part of the book. Modern society is forgetting some valuable lessons learned painfully from history, state and religion must be separate, and specially today, when the world is facing religious fundamentalist, whether they are Jewish, Christian or Muslin, becoming terrorists in the name of their God, and trying to impose to the rest of the world their own beliefs.<br /><br />I am a confessed Deist, as Mr. Dawkins defines in the book (I believe in God, but not in a Personal God nor in religious rituals, God does not intervene in our daily little affairs), so I found the subject very interesting without being offended. I really could not put down the book. In the end, in my humble opinion and trying to evaluate the book's hypothesis objectively, Mr. Dawkins weakest rationale has to do with the origin of the Universe (Big Bang) and the beginning of life. Particularly the beginning of the Universe, as shown by modern astrophysics, it's a very rare event with a minuscule chance of occurring at random or spontaneously, the initial conditions were extremely sensible, a tiny variation in any direction and the universe and life as we know it would not exist. Dawkins rationale on this matter is just speculation as he recognizes (as illustrated by the parallel universes theory he mentions, there is plenty of that in Sci-Fi novels, movies and even Star Trek) In fact, and just to see how far the imagination can go, give a peek to R.J. Sawyer's \\"Calculating God\\" for such brilliant speculation could also be used as proof of God existence, shame that is only a successful hard Sci-Fi novel!, but the philosophical discussion presented by Mr. Sawyer regarding the origin of life and the universe is more objective and presents a fair balance between the arguments of both sides of the issue, based on scientific fact and without attacking existing religions. Actually Dawkins hopes that in the future science will show he is right. Just read the summary at the end of Chapter 4.<br /><br />There lies the only and weakest argument in defense of his theory of the non-existence of God. This is because the origin of the Universe is in fact a great challenge to scientists, since the laws of physics, as we know them, began only after the Big Bang, and so far there is no evidence of how things were before the Big Bang, even if time existed before that. I bet that will be a though barrier to overcome. There our knowledge is blank and open to all kinds of interpretation and speculation. If you are interested in a different interpretation completely opposed to Dawkins' from a qualified scientist, read Francis S. Collins' book [[ASIN:1416542744 The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief]]<br /><br />My personal belief is that cosmology and evolution seem through science show us the handiwork of the Creator, God!, but no miracles, fairy tales or rites are required. Let's hope some day we all respect the other's religion, beliefs and specially, those who are atheist, and there will be nobody trying to impose their own beliefs. And let's make sure religion is kept separate from politics and the state.<br /><br />PS: For a detailed discussion of multiple universes as the reason for not requiring the God hypothesis to explain the origin of the universe do not miss Stephen Hawking's 2010 [[ASIN:0553805371 The Grand Design]], fairy tales or rites are required.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|It's tough to tell how to read the reviews for the new CD.  Someone will give what looks like a thoughtful opinion of the CD, but then they'll say they think the finest Rush CD is \\"Counterparts\\" or another one of the band's lesser works, and I'll wonder if the reviewer is clinically insane.  So, to get it out of the way, I've been a fan since I saw the band on tour with \\"Hemispheres\\".  I feel the finest Rush is that run of albums from \\"Caress of Steel\\" to \\"Moving Pictures\\".  Of their more recent work I feel \\"Vapor Trails\\" is majestic, probably their most mature work lyrically, but it lacked a little something, a good flow from song to song.<br /><br />\\"Snakes and Arrows\\" feels like \\"Vapor Trails\\" with guitar solos, a smoother flow, and much better production.  If I gave \\"Vapor Trails\\" high marks (4 Stars), there's no way I can give this CD less than 4 and a half stars.<br /><br />Someone who was being critical of this CD said something like \\"It's got less energy than the early stuff\\".  I'd say this CD has tons of energy but shows that development in sound that pretty much every artist from R.E.M. to RUSH displays in their later career.  It's less frantic/condensed than the early stuff maybe, but the trade-off is that this new music has a depth that can pretty much rival any songwriting being done today by any artist.<br /><br />Possibly their best since their heyday, since \\"Grace Under Pressure\\".
B0000844I8|5.0|I can't count how many times I've watched this movie. I remember how seamlessly realistic the graphics were when it first came out in theaters. Though the graphics are still good, technology has since outdone them. The movie opens with a mysterious ancient egyptian discovery in the 1920's. Then jets to the present, introducing a controversial, outcast, egyptologist. A brilliant historian, who is completely dismissed by his colleagues because of his interpretation of archaeological evidence. Just as he is about to wind up penniless on the streets, he is approached to interpret an artifact. Knowing nothing about the nature of the item, other than it's origins. He finds himself swept into an amazing journey across galaxies. Where he and a team of soldiers encounter an ancient alien ruler, an oppressed planet of human slaves, and the missing pieces to egyptian history. Stargate is a colorful tapestry of fantasy and science fiction that has been wonderfully woven together.
0743298020|5.0|Even on page one, I knew from the intricacy of language and the lacy full bodied sentences, that I was going to gobble up this one down. A well written book is a treasured jewel that should not be missed even if the story is, lacking princess, magical castles, and slain dragons. Luckily this story was not missing the novelty and the excitement of a well constructed \\"magical\\" tale aside from being written so very well.<br />It is a nice read, engulfing, somewhat emotive, but more than anything very engaging.<br />Go ahead, buy this one. The worst case scenario: you will walk away feeling satisfied from picking up a very well written book.
B0008KLVG4|3.0|This movie is a good thriller.  It staggers the imagination as far as how well it has succeeded.  I am in agreement with Robert Shaw, the British actor who played Quint (which Amazon has amazingly left out of the actors listed for the film).  Shaw didn't believe the film would do well, so he took a flat fee for his role, rather than the percentage he was initially offered.  A mistake, in hindsight.  However, I agree with his initial instinct.  This film is fun, but flatter than a pancake.  The most interesting part of the movie is the character Quint, which, by the way, Shaw added to by creating interesting lines for his character.  Shaw was not just a great actor, but a very fine writer as well.  Here's to the memory of Robert Shaw--you are greatly missed, Robert!
B000NVIXFK|1.0|I wanted this release to be awesome. As a fan since the late 70's and veteran of twenty Rush concerts, I've watched this one time rock power trio spiral downward through the 90's into nothing more than a \\"has been\\" group. The songs on Snakes and Arrows are too boring to tap my foot, air drum, or nod along with my head ala Garth Algar of Wayne's World. And forget about singing along in your car like you did to Tom Sawyer or Spirit of Radio. Those songs were upbeat & happy. The latest tracks are predictable, mundane and forgettable. <br /> <br />Rush became a household name due to the myriad of memorable guitar riffs like those from Working Man, Fly by Night, Freewill, Limelight and others. Ask any of the group's longtime fans to name their hits from the 90's, and it's like a trick question. There just aren't any. And the group hasn't done anything with this album to resurrect their sound back to the Glory Days. <br /> <br />One wonders if they've forgotten how or if they just don't care after 30 years. <br /> <br />\\"Hope\\", a guitar instrumental performed solely by Lifeson, is the one exception on the CD. It's refreshing because it doesn't sound like Rush. It's too bad the only decent track on the album is so short. <br /> <br />Peart, the drummer and primary reason for the cult-like underground following, has been considered by many (including me) to be the best drummer ever. That makes it even more disappointing when one hears the intro to \\"Armor and Sword\\", in which he obviously copied a groove laid down by one of his peers during the recording of his Buddy Rich Tribute. <br /> <br />Lee's vocals at times sound like bad Karaoke. The beginning of \\"Bravest Face\\" sounds as though he's trying to invent a melody as he reads the lyrics for the first time. In fact, there are no melodies to stick with you after the album has finished. Nothing to remember, nothing to like, nothing to replay in your mind time after time. <br /> <br />Don't waste your money on this one. Instead, buy anything from their 1974-1984 period. Because even after that music ends, the melody lingers on...
B00080ZG10|5.0|One of the greatest compliments to any film, IMHO, is when it can be called a great work of art. And this one is just that, a great work of art. Leonardo DiCaprio was great, as usual, in this film. I've read, in some places, that the film took a few liberties with facts about Hughes, but it's still a great film. It also highlights the rather unknown facts of Hughes' excentricities, OCD, which can be devastating for some, and greatly misunderstood by those around them. But the art and craftwork that went into creating the period are just fantastic.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|Horrible movie! I was so excited to see it but it was so horrible I had to force myself to watch it to the end! There are three separate stories told but one has almost nothing to do with it except for the gun. It showed underage teen girls fully nude or showing their private parts in public plus inappropriate behavior. The story of the gunman (2 kids) showed one 6 year old boy masturbating & watching his sister in the shower! Yuk! (This had NOTHING to do with the actual story of how they accidentally shot the tourist!)<br /><br />Another horrible story was the woman's kids were left to die in the desert and you don't know until the end if they actually survived - horrible! Your kids will have nightmares if they see this movie! I was SO disappointed watching this movie it isn't the action film that the previews promised. The pacing was slow, disjointed & boring! What a waste of Brad Pitt & Kate Blanchett's talent! Their acting was good but the rest of the stories ruined the main storyline!
B0007PALRU|5.0|I just saw this movie for the 3rd time and it still chills my spine to see how the future will be like for the human kind.  The Global warming is a serious matter, and since most of the governments all over the Globe are corrupted, they just think about making more money, expanding cities and making more industries destroying ecological places that should be untouched and protected, instead they are selling virgin forests and seashores to multimillionaire franchises that pay good money to expand their businesses that eventually will contaminate more our atmosphere and destroy the green areas which are the natural lungs and decontaminating filters of our planet .  The unscrupulously destruction of our forests/woods/jungles; spill of oils/chemical & human wastes on the ocean, and the throwing of chemical pollutants to the air will result in the same events shown on this apocalyptical movie.  The movie of course is \\"Hollywood\\" made, just to entertain.  The events that would take probably years were accelerated at a REAL fast pace... All the events won't occur in a 24-48 hours period, they will occur gradually within a long period, but I'm sure the purpose of the producers is not to give a full National Geographic documental, but a general scientific overview of events that awaits us because of our lack of respect to God's creation: our only one home, THE EARTH!!!   <br />The Day After Tomorrow was a Box Office success: <br />Budget $125,000,000  <br />USA Box Office: $187 Million  <br />Worldwide Box Office: $528 Million   <br />Also won 4 international awards including: <br />1. BAFTA Awards: Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects <br />2. BMI Film & TV Awards: BMI Film Music Award <br />3. MTV Movie Awards: Best Action Sequence, For the destruction of Los Angeles. <br />4. Visual Effects Society Awards: Best Single Visual Effect of the Year, <br />For the tidal wave. <br />And had also another 7 nominations.
B000MRAAJW|4.0|Brilliant documentary, great sound and HD quality. Bought HD player just for Planet Earth. However this HD release could be improved: <br /> <br />- MUST (would pay more money for it!): Add another audiotrack with Sigourney Weaver narration from Planet Earth broadcast on USA Discovery channel. David Attenborough's voice sounds too old for my ears. Some people want David's narration badly, but why not have both if technology allows?  <br /> <br />- Use dramatic Discovery's theatrical trailer in the beginning of every disk - not a sunrise from space. <br /> <br />- Add more chapter markers - currently only 5 per episode. <br /> <br />- Increase volume on the center channel - I had to turn on dialog enhancement feature on my player just to hear narrator's voice (or may be this is just my setup, although center channel sound on other HD DVDs plays fine).
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This movie will be a classic in the series... it was intense as all James Bond movies full of action and unexpected sub plots; but Mr Craig put his personal signature to it... his strong and masculine performance gives the series a new twist... and I bet many people that saw the movie knows what I'm talking about.  I think that this will be the beginning of a new series of successful James Bond movies.  5 stars to Daniel Craig and his magnificence performance. <br />
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Their best effort in years - I enjoyed the whole thing and it's been a long time since I liked a RUSH album from first track to last.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I am a huge Rush fan, so I always look forward to seeing what they come up with next. This is an interesting and very different kind of Rush album. Their previous effort (Vapor Trails) was one of my favorite by them, this one remains down in the middle. There are some high points: Far Cry, The Larger Bowl, Spindrift, The Main Monkey Business. Out of the whole album, Far Cry and The Larger Bowl are what captivated me most, although Malignant Narcissism was testorone cool. That said it does not crack my top five (Moving Pictures, Permanent Waves, 2112, Counterparts, and Vapor Trails). There is an urgency that is missing in the album after Far Cry. This album reminds me more of 1989's Presto, very thoughtful, reflective but lacking the energy. I loved Peart lyrics on that album, but not the musical interpretation. Same with this one. That said, for any Rush head, this is a must and a chance to hear Alex play accoustic and get into Neil's head a little bit.
B000BNX4MC|4.0|hard to believe it's been 21 years since this movie was released. I can't tell you how I did my best to incorporate so many of his suggestions when trying to get out of going to school.... unfortunately it didn't work as well for me as it did for him!<br /><br />That having been said, I love the DVD format of this movie. It's crisp and clear and I'd swear there are scenes that were not on my VHS tape that broke many years ago. I could be getting old but I do think they stuck some extra footage in.<br /><br />Whatever the case, this movie is just as good now as it was 21 years ago. But I think I'll wait till my son is 18 to let him view it! He doesn't need any more ideas!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Let's be honest here.  The enjoyment of music is a highly personal and subjective experience.  Consequently, I'm amused by the reviewers that try to paint themselves as some sort of authority on what constitutes proper music for RUSH to play as though they have some kind of superlative  standard or insight.  Yes, yes, we can all see that you fancy yourself a  musician and that you've seen the band in concert 20 million times.  That doesn't mean that you are the \\"One True Fan\\" and everyone else needs to agree with you. <br /> <br />The truth is these songs will either click for you or they won't.  The only way you can know is to give it a listen.  So, I suggest that you ignore anyone that evangelizes their opinion as through it were fact and instead trust your own judgment.  <br /> <br />That being said, my own personal reaction is that this album is excellent.  I find the subject matter very insightful and Neil's lyrics to be in top form.  I really enjoy the new blend of blues rhythms, tight bass, and - especially - the acoustic guitar that forms the melodic center for many songs. <br /> <br />If you're intrigued by that description, you owe it to yourself to ignore the juveniles who think they know better what you'll like than you do. Get an earful and then make up your own mind.
B00005JPAO|2.0|To be sure, the performances are all high-caliber (although Judi Dench was ROBBED of an Oscar). But really, who cares about this? I really hoped this would have been a deeper character study of the life of \\"The Queen\\", but instead all you get is a sliver as it relates to the death of Diana. I sat in a theater thinking, \\"Is this IT?\\". This is nothing but an A&E-type channel docudrama with higher production values. How it ascended to the level of \\"respectability\\" it has boggles the mind.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|True genius is seldom appreciated.  Joss Whedon and the cast of Firefly produced something so special it seems like it was destined to not find a home in Fox's lineup.  It is a tragedy that so many people still haven't  heard of Firefly.  BUY THIS SERIES, then BUY SERENITY, then pray that Sci-Fi Channel or somebody might still have the good sense to bring Firefly back!
B000000OUJ|5.0|This is really a great disc. The GZA isn't my favorite Wu-Tang MC and (people will hate my for this) I don't think he's the most talented (I'm gonna side with Ghost) and I certainly don't think this is the best We solo disc (Cuban Linx has a tighter concept.) But, again, this is a really great disc. <br />  It showcases what the GZA does best, and that's old school rhymes with clever metaphors and punchlines. RZA's production on Liquid Swords is slowed down from Cuban Linx and even 36 Chambers, which allows the GZA to move at his own pace. The most prominent guests - Method Man and Inspectah Deck - work well to complement what is going on. Indeed, I don't think Deck has sounded better than this album (Duel of the Iron Mic, Cold World.) Meth's work on Shadowboxin' makes some of the dopest verses you'll ever hear (\\"fiend to catch a n***a snoozin'/slip the cardiac/arrest me/exorcist hip-hop possess me/crunch a n***a like a Nestle/you know my steeze\\") <br />  The Genius also has a chance to shine on concept songs like Labels and Killah Hills 10304 in a way that he doesn't on Wu-Tang posse tracks. As mentioned by other reviewers, Labels is constructed around the names record labels and is a cautionary tale about thinking that a record deal is going to solve your problems (\\"Tommy ain't my muthaf***in Boy/when he fakes moves on a n***a he employ\\".) Killah Hills is the kind of in-depth drug dealer narrative that you would expect from Ghostface or Raewkwon, but the GZA holds his own, creating an even grimier scene than either of them (except maybe Ghost's \\"Malcom\\" from Supreme Clientele.) <br />  The only \\"problems\\" occur when GZA flows over quicker beats with quicker MCs - notably on 4th Chamber and Investigative Reports. RZA, Rae and Ghost have such quick, dexterous flows and rapid fire rhymes that the songs seem to drag under the GZA's straight-forward, laid-back delivery. I realize this has more to do with preferences, so I still give the album five stars, but it's something that's always stood out to me. <br />  All in all, this is a fantastic piece of work from a very talented MC and worth every penny you would ever have to pay for it. It makes me long for the golden era of mid-90's NY hip-hop. Buy, listen, enjoy.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Porcupine Tree has been one of my favorite bands for years; picking up the gauntlet thrown down by '70s progressive rock groups such as Pink Floyd, King Crimson and Rush...they have gained much acclaim over the last few years due to some excellent reviews and publicity surrounding their last few albums- I suppose it's only fitting that 2007 brings us yet another masterpiece from Steven Wilson and Co., and that it features guest appearances from both Robert Fripp and Alex Lifeson, prog greats and obvious influences themselves.<br /><br />Fans have been torn somewhat as of late by the seeming split between the early, spacey-trance-psychedelia evident on older PT releases such as \\"Signify\\" and \\"Sky Moves Sideways\\" and the heavier, more rock-oriented approach on subsequent albums...most notably \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Deadwing\\". I have always enjoyed all of their material, and I was very happy with the blend of those two styles found on the new album...some songs are quite heavy( \\"Anesthetize\\" features some of the heaviest, most progressive time-signature riffs this band has ever attempted...almost Tool-like, at times)while some are quite sedate, with quite a bit of Mellotron and synth, as well as the requisite hypnotic, arpeggiated chords and guitar work. Very much a continutation of the overall flow of \\"Deadwing\\", but with a few more moments of melancholy psychedelia. Very highly recommended, and one of the best prog rock bands out today.
B000NA1OXY|1.0|Avril`s first two cd`s Let Go and Under my Skin showed great talent and were easy to like. I was hoping for the same with her latset release but it was`nt to be.This [...] ain`t worth the material its recorded on. I was totally bummin when I realized I wasted my hard earned money on something that I will NEVER listen to again! I guess I will have to go back to her first two cd`s and hope that she gets over her\\"sell out\\" phase before releasing another cd.If her next release is ANYTHING like this one,shes probably done for good! I now use this CD as a drink coaster! REALLY!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I am 25 years old and absolutely love this music!  Michael Bublé is an amazing entertainer in the style of Sinatra, Darin, and Martin but brings a charisma all his own.  This 'Call Me Irresponsible' CD has solidified him as a force to be reckoned with in the music world.      Forget the hip hop and rap stars, this guy is the real deal! The music he sings is timeless, and his own songs are from the heart.  'The Best is Yet To Come' has always been one of my favorites of Sinatra and Nancy Wilson.  Bublé's version is even better!  His smoothe vocals coupled with the big band sound are extraordinary.    'It Had Better Be Tonight' is amazing.  This guy has a wide range of vocal ability and it is clearly displayed in the song at the end with the long phrases.  One of my favs.    'Me and Mrs. Jones' and 'I'm Your Man' are incredibly sexy, and 'Comin Home Baby' is a neat duet with Boyz II Men.      'Lost' is a beautiful original song that Michael wrote, and the lyrics are extremely powerful.  'Everything' is a fun up-tempo love song that is just carefree and fun to listen to.  I love his original pieces.    Oh, and who can forget the title of the album 'Call Me Irresponsible'?  What a fantastic vocal display Bublé has recorded on this song.  It is just amazing.    'I've Got the World on a String' is so much fun.  It just makes you want to get up and dance, and you can hear Michael's personality come through in his voice.      'Always on My Mind' is perhaps the greatest version of this song recorded to date.  It is reserved and heartfelt, and his voice is stunning.    'That's Life' is so much FUN!!!! The choir is excellent, and it sounds like Bublé is really enjoying himself. You will too!    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD to everyone!!!! Please enjoy and catch Michael on tour in your city this summer.  He's even more remarkable in the flesh!!!!    Somebody give this man a GRAMMY!
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|The Truman Show (1998) directed by Peter Weir is a story of an ordinary man who does not know that he is a star of a long running show that started on the day he was born and depicts every smallest detail of his life in a picture perfect small town of Seahaven for all world to see. Everything and everybody around him is not real, including his family, his friends, his job, and the whole world that seems so friendly and familiar. The ultimate irony is in his name - he is the only TRUE man among the actors.<br /><br />Jim Carrey's performance is a revelation and it is still a mystery for me why he was overlooked by the Academy of Motion Pictures that year and was not rewarded for his superlative work. He's been helped by Laura Lynney and Ed Harris (great performance). The true star of the movie is Peter Weir's directing - he is the real Creator of this \\"theater of absurd\\".
B000002JSN|5.0|The is the encapsulation of the best of Zeppelin. From the trademark heavy rock of Custard Pie or Sick Again and the bombastic blues of In My Time of Dying to the fresh Middle Eastern influences most notably heard on the stunning Kashmir, and all points in between, this is a remarkable piece of work. What I particularly like about this record is that they take a lot of chances and most of them work incredibly well. They had shown signs of diversity on previous records and it comes to maturity here. The benefits of a band that can take advantage of their hard-won success and truly allow themselves to spread their wings (the Stones with Exile) are evident in songs like Ten Years Gone, In the Light, and Kashmir. The Rover, my favorite Zep song of all time is just one of the many memorable numbers here. If I had to pick one Led Zeppelin album to have, this is it, no questions asked.<br />All of Zeppelin's unpaid blues dues aside (and there are quite a few), Physical Graffiti, with songs full of awesome power, moving beauty, and influences from around the globe that redefined rock and roll, is the only evidence anyone needs to prove Led Zeppelin's rightful place in the top five rock acts of all time.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|After initially finding Snakes and Arrows awful I have come to really like it. In fact it's thoroughly enjoyable with the exception of two songs. But it is a far cry from Vapor Trails. <br /> <br />However what really bothers me is the arrogance and ignorance so prevalent on this work which is very unbecoming of the band. I'm wondering how Neil Peart found blunt phrases on church marquees in the American Bible belt so parallel to the killing of Christians by Muslim extremists in the Middle East. But of the two groups though, who will rise from the ashes a blaze of Everyday Glory? <br />
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Rush continues along their path of excellence with their latest effort, Snakes and Arrows. Although a first listen may not uncover all the masterful complexity this album has to offer, its one that offers new pleasures with each listening with songs that seem to get stronger with each play. A few things do immediately characterize this album - the always strong musicianship, unmistakeably Rush, for one. The songs all have an organic quality to them, having been composed primarily on acoustic guitar. Finally the superb production on this album allows all the nuances of each instrument to be heard properly, in perfect balance with the rest of the instruments.    Rush comes out swinging with Far Cry, notably punctuated with a complex time riff followed by a chord known to Rush fans as \\"The Hemispheres Chord\\". As evidenced by the number of teenage guitarists covering this song on YouTube, Alex is again playing stuff guitarists will want to cover.    Armor and Sword follows, combining acoustic flourishes with a heavy guitar riff reminiscent of Cygnus X-1 from A Farewell to Kings.     Working Them Angels has an evocative verse section and powerful and catchy chorus. Another very strong song continuing a strong start for this album. All three of these first songs are likely to be played in concert.    The Larger Bowl slows things down a bit with the most acoustically flavored tune so far along with some fairly sobering lyrics concerning the inherent unfairness in life.    Spindrift is one of those classic \\"dark\\" Rush songs, in the tradition of Witch Hunt, Between the Wheels, or Time and Motion. The lyrics are some of the most interesting I've seen from Peart alternating between overwhelming feelings from observing environmental elements(ie \\"As the waves crash in on the western shore\\") to more interpersonal lyrics directed at someone.(\\"where is the wave that will carry me a little closer to you\\")    The Main Monkey Business is undoubtedly \\"the masterpiece of the album\\" Neilalluded to months back in an interview. Its everything you could want from a Rush instrumental - its powerful, technical, and moving. Its as good or better than any instrumental they've ever done. (edit - I'm wrong - as Neil pointed out in a later interview, his masterpiece was Armor and Sword. From a lyrical standpoint, I'd agree, but where the music is concerned, I still say this song is the high point. ;) )    Next up is The Way the Wind Blows, with an uncharacteristic(for Rush), yet very powerful blues riff opening the song. Then, a hard rock riff and Geddy's voice takes over. Finally, an acoustic chorus, then back to the blues riff. A very interesting musical arrangement plus lyrics that continue the albums theme of religious extremism and its effects.    Hope is an acoustic instrumental by Alex, showcasing six and twelve string guitars as well as mandolin, mandola, and bouzouki. It's somewhat of a musical tour-de-force, with Celtic and Americana-tinged stylings, both relaxing and interesting to listen to.    Faithless continues the albums lyrical theme, this time covering exactly what the lyricist does and does not believe. While this song might be hard for someone religious to listen to, its basically a statement of the universe as the writer perceives it, (\\"I don't have faith in faith. I don't believe in belief\\") decrying blind faith while at the same time embracing love and hope.    Bravest Face contrasts the world portrayed in that classic Louis Armstrong tune, \\"Its a Wonderful World\\" or those TV shows where the ending is always happy with the world so many people have to live in each day. Yet the overall vibe is positive, with the lyrics exhorting the listener to face up to reality and \\"Put on your bravest face\\". It's another interesting musical arrangement, alternating between bluesy sounding acoustic and electric guitars and a powerful, melodic rock section.    Good News First is another cool song building from a somewhat quiet and spooky sounding verse section. The artwork for this song in the CD liner is especially striking...a crow pecks at a grave, while a wind-blown newspapers heading reads \\"Cure Discovered\\". Yes, the good news first, please. Incredibly deep lyrics on this one, this song could mean so many different things to different people.    Malignant Narcissism is the third instrumental on this album, its short and to the point. It's a little reminiscient of YYZ, but more modern sounding and with a few new surprises. Listen carefully to the drums on this one, Neil's playing a five-piece.    Finally, the album ends on an energetic high note with \\"We Hold On\\".     All in all, Snakes and Arrows has the goods. Not a single tune that I'd want to skip on a repeated listen. Its both interesting and new, yet reminiscent of classic Rush at the same time. Finally, Snakes and Arrows has the production a Rush album deserves; great songs deserve to sound great. Enjoy it, and if you don't get it at first, realize this is complex music and that it might take a few listens to really get whats going on.
B0006FFRW0|5.0|Thank you Trent Reznor.  <br /> <br />Everything that Pretty Hate Machine was, this wasn't.  <br /> <br />Yet that album is a timeless classic that set the tone for Rock, Pop,  and Industrial for years to come.  <br /> <br />I love this album to death, but personally I enjoyed the Fragile more...the soundscapes are amazing.  <br /> <br />
B000MXPE7O|1.0|I saw it in the theater and man this movie sucks!  This is the only movie that literally fell asleep to.  Don't let these actors get money for garbage like this!  It's a bunch of talking and very little action.  Waste of damn three hours of my life.  It is so damn pointless.  Instead, watch a real movie like Departed(has Matt Damon as well), the Shooter, Perfect Stranger.  They are all much more entertaining than this trash!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|michael has done it again. what a wonderful collection of old songs updated and new songs that you will love. he is truely entertaining. this cd will not disappoint. we love it!!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I have read the bad reviews and I think they have it all wrong the cd is one that you must see in the writing as Rush has been over the last 30+ years each cd is different they always have changed why should this be any different I love the cd its one of the best work since the 90s.  <br />Good Job Guys  <br /> <br /> <br />
038533348X|5.0|\\"Call me Jonah,\\" CAT'S CRADLE begins, referencing the unfortunate soul who got stuck in a whale.  This Jonah is a journalist who has decided to write a book about the architect of the bomb that \\"resolved\\" World War II.  It is not a spoiler to say that he learns after tracking the deceased scientist's post-war life and work that on the day the bomb was dropped, Dr. Newton Hoenikker was playing with a piece of string and as one of his now adult children observes of the children's game of the book's title, there was no cat, there was no cradle.  Much of the book becomes a chase down to a Caribbean island republic with a colorful bunch of characters, some accidentally and others not quite so accidentally caught up with the scientist's next big thing after the bomb.   <br /> <br />Vonnegut uses this absurd comic tale to comment seriously about the problem of unchecked power, whether it is scientific or political.  He gets in some views on religion, too, and invents an entire new one out of whole cloth, \\"Bokononism,\\" which is rife with its founder's sayings.  Rereading this 1963 book again in 2007 after thirty odd years, I am astounded at the number of prophetic passages that suggest things that later became a part of our cultural language, including  napalm, nuclear winter, Jonestown, Katrina, and politicians who don't \\"get it\\" about how America is regarded by the outside world.   <br /> <br />There is a warm, sad smile in Vonnegut's voice that makes his stuff compelling.  His is an inventive vision that melds the comic and fantastic with a shrewd, philosophical look below the surface of human dealings.  I especially like the passage in which he puts in his two cents on the value of writers, that they compare to firefighters and emergency personnel, and even college professors, because they all perform essential services to humanity. <br />
0312995423|3.0|DIGITAL FORTRESS is Dan Brown's debut, and is also his weakest novel.  I found it mildly enjoyable, because Brown is a very tight plotter and the pace of this book is very fast.  This novel is filled with a lot of action, and I kept turning the pages to see how everything would end.<br /><br />Unfortunately, DIGITAL FORTRESS has some major shortcomings.  Most of the characters (including the two main characters) are rather flat and uninteresting.  Many of the supporting characters are woefully underdeveloped.  The plot centers around computer technology, and I personally found Brown's explanations of this technology to be rather dry and boring.  I am admittedly not a techie, but there are sections of this book that read like a computer manual, and I found myself skipping certain paragraphs.<br /><br />The best part of DIGITAL FORTRESS involves the breaking of certain codes, which I found very enjoyable.  The best part of this novel is the ending, which is exciting and fun.  I wish the entire book was as thrilling as the last seventy-five or so pages.<br /><br />This novel is okay, but I personally believe that Brown's Robert Langdon novels are far superior.  I would definitely try those books, especially ANGELS & DEMONS, which I think is a genuinely great thriller.
0385335989|3.0|.  In this fourth volume of her time travel/romance series, Gabaldon continues the adventures of Claire and Jamie Fraser.  Shipwrecked on the coast of the American colonies, Claire and Jamie are making their way to North Carolina where many Scottish exiles have settled after serving time as indentured servants.  They are faced with the task of making a life in the wild, untamed American wilderness menaced by hostile Indians, bear, venomous snakes and disease.  But Claire and Jamie rise to the challenge.  Jamie accepts the offer of the Carolina governor to start a settlement on a beautiful mountain that will soon be known as \\"Fraser's Ridge\\" which he hopes to fill with former fellow Scottish prisoners from Ardsmuir.  But their lives are disrupted by the sudden appearance of their beloved daughter Brianna whom they believed to be safely settled in the future.  Brianna has risked her life to find Jamie and Claire to warn them that they are destined to die in a terrible fire in less than eight years. Although filled with joy to have Brianna join them, the Frasers are terrified by the dangers that colonial America provides to a young woman.  Following from the future is her lover and Claire's friend, Roger Wakefield, a Scottish historian who has fallen in love with Brianna.  Roger is the only man able to use the mysterious stones to travel to the past because he is the descendant of the witch Geilie, Claire's nemesis.  As usual, Gabaldon has crafted a lusty, exciting tale that propels the reader at a lightning pace through bear attacks, hangings, mystical encounters with ghosts and lots and lots of juicy sex.  At its heart, this is after all, a romance series, so the fiery passionate scenes between Claire and Jamie are still just as urgent and descriptive as Gabaldon's other volumes in the series.  It's refreshing to have a pair of middle-aged protagonists who still find delight in each other. However, I do concede that by this volume, Gabaldon's plot formulas sometimeswear thin. Her reluctance to end the series that is already many thousands of pages, means that Gabaldon often repeats plot devices like the resurrection of a supposedly dead character or the amazing coincidences that sometimes drive the story.  Still, the book is entertaining.
B000N3ST7K|5.0|Tarantino may have lost his way in terms of his writing in this movie, but the disappointing 'DEATH PROOF' is partially redeemed by a wonderful soundtrack which as usual is an entertaining mixed bag of the familliar and the obscure. Foremost is 'Baby it's you' by Smith, which sounds even better without having to watch the skanky Jungle Julia dance to it. As usual I'll probably be spending more money chasing down more material by the artists featured by Tarantino. This soundtrack deserved to be on a better movie!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I don't see anything wrong with this album. Geddy actually sounds better than usual, the sound is great, the production is crisp and the melodies are excellent. <br /> <br />Whoever thinks this CD sucks needs some form of psychological evaluation.
0307346609|2.0|First let it be known that I am a HUGE fan of zombie fiction. I even run a zombie book club in the city where I live. That said, this book was a tremendous let down for me. The author presents an incoherent picture of the world during and after a world wide zombie outbreak.  <br /> <br />Individual sections of the book truly shine and are well worth reading. But the author should have spent some time reading other alterate history war novels. Chief among my complaints is the lack of any kind of timeline or overview of the events. The experiences of the survivors are presented with no real context.  <br /> <br />Many intriguing things are mentioned in passing and then ignored. Examples that come to mind include an Israeli civil war and attempts at secession by people in the zombie occupied USA. Perhaps we as readers might be interested in just few details about the world where he has set the book. <br /> <br />Worse than that which is ignored, are certain inane assertions that the  author makes. The one that really set us off in our book club was when a character states that an overwhelming percentage of americans had no  war relevant skills because they are involved in some kind of information oriented white collar work and need to be retrained. This may seem true to the author, who is from a wealthy family (son of Mel Brooks), but is highly insulting to those of us who live in the real world where most people are blue collar workers who can repair their own homes. The author's grasp of how weapons work is also suspect. He informs us that artillery is of little use against zombies, because hydrostatic shock doesn't effect them. As a big nerd I have ask, how an expanding ball of white hot shrapnel fails to destroy brains. Plague of the Dead presents a much better account of how a millitary could fail against hordes of zombies simply by being overwhelmed. One further problem, is that he states that the outbreak is world wide, but portrays the US army retreating west as though the outbreak is primarily originating from the east coast. This is typical of the lack of thought put into this book. <br /> <br />His attempt to insert a little thinly veiled poltical commentary is hamhanded and awkward. Certain politicians are implied to be real people from our world, but the author lacks the courage to refer to them by name and write a real alternate history. As result, the inclusion of these people feels forced and detracts from story. <br /> <br />In short, I give this book two stars because it comes so close to being a great zombie novel, and then repeatedly dissapoints. If you really like zombies, spend your money on Plague of the Dead, Day by Day Armageddon, or one of the many better zombie novels written in recent years.
B00007AJF8|1.0|This film received rave reviews for being  \\"original, innovative, unique.\\" As one can see from the reviews on this site, many viewers agreed with that assessment, but I don't. It just seemd bizarre, and not in a good way. Different can be very good, if it's interesting. When it has me looking at the clock wondering to myself, \\"how much longer will this turkey last?\\", then I know it simply didn't connect with me.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just too bleak to \\"get it\\" and I should stick with more conventional comedies like \\"Big Lebowski.\\" Now, there's a great film!
B000AP04L0|4.0|Delightfully funny comedy, a parody of office style working with great memorable quotes and funny antics.  I don't think this is a movie to watch over and over again.  It was nice to see once but I wouldn't watch it again, at least for a while.  I pretty much already have all of the funny quotes memorized so there is really no sense in watching it over again. <br /> Peter Gibbons, is just not doing great!  He is not doing good with his girlfriend, his neighbor is obnoxious, and he is miserable at his office job and just does not seem to be going anywhere in life until a hypnotic suggestion makes him see the world through different eyes.  Free of worrying from just about everything, Peter cruises through the company.  When company layoffs affect his two best friends, he decides to affect the company a little by embezzling money from their account.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I can not stop listening to track #2. Thats the one after the awesome sounding Farcry. I could remember the eagerness back in the 80s for Rush to relea-- I mean, unleash their next album. They just brought that qulaity and feeling back for me. What a great release. The decision to include 4 instrumentals was a great idea, at least for me, because I am a big Satriani and Enevoldson fan. The instrumentals play big and the other tunes play bigger. Rush is back, although, for me, I could always go back to Moving pictures and Signals and know that they are always still here and still powerful.

0393327655|2.0|Sam Harris sees the hand of religion everywhere and neglects the other two big sources of trouble in the world: cash and guns. His analysis doesn't go much further than the surface -- he can't seem to see through the rhetoric and understand that politicians only use religion for manipulation -- they don't really believe any of that stuff. <br /> <br />He also verges on fascism in taking Noam Chomsky to task over his comparisons of the murder of Iraqi civilians by the US to the murder of US civilians by Saudi terrorists. Chomsky say there's no moral difference between the death of an Iraqi or an American. Harris says there is because the Americans had \\"good intentions\\" when they invaded Iraq. What? The fact that tens of thousands of Iraqi women and children would die as a direct result of the invasion was well known to US military planners (\\"collateral damage\\") but they went ahead anyway. Harris says it's OK because they meant well. Remember that the US is the only country in history to have ever attacked civilians with nuclear weapons, killing hundreds of thousands, but, ah, we needed to end the war, better them than us! <br /> <br />If Harris has his way we replace the religious basis of morality with an atheist one that authorizes anything at all, as long as you set out to do \\"good\\" in the end. Good for whom? <br /> <br />Dennett, Dawkins and Hitchens do a much better job than Harris at excising religion from the body of society -- and dissecting it on the operating table prior to disposal in the biohazard bin. But Harris meant well, so you have to give him that. <br /> <br />
B000001GBJ|5.0|I first heard this CD in a Meditation class.  The haunting Celtic melodies of this CD are very relaxing and set a very quiet, calming mood.  I can't wait to buy more from this group.
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|This is a very good drama. It is interesting to see how the movie develops the two main characters.  They both have different and diverse backgrounds but they find that they need each other in the end.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|A bit disappointing for me. Not quite up to her usual superb style, still it is Loreena and she's a cut above the rest - even when she's not at her best!
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Just to let you know where this Rush fan is coming from, I thought \\"Vapor Trails\\" was below par. I'm also a fan of 80's Rush, right up to \\"Roll The Bones.\\" I was under their spell and then......grunge happened. It seemed to knock Rush off track, trying to prove they could still rock hard. As a result, I enjoyed half of \\"Counterparts\\" and \\"Test of Echo\\" (made a great compilation btw) and then VT, so I was nervous about \\"Snakes And Arrows.\\"  Well, like many good albums, it doesn't necessarily grab you on first listen, but it is a grower. Also, I am very pleased to say that the recording quality and artwork are excellent. 3 1/2 stars.

B000002UDB|5.0|Gibson's, the department store where I bought this album, was on the way to my favorite pizza place.  The night I bought Magical Mystery Tour, we also picked up some pizzas for dinner.  To this day, I think of my favorite pizza everytime I see the album cover and/or hear the music.  I've long since bought all the Beatle albums there are to have and it's kind of a shame there are no new Beatle albums left to experience for the first time.  They also tore down my favorite pizza place years ago.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This news is about a month old as of this writing, but DavisDVD reported on April 3rd that director Wolfgang Peterson is getting $1M and his chance to go back and put out his definitive version of this historical epic film, much like Ridley Scott did with Kingdom of Heaven and Oliver Stone with Alexander.<br /><br />Apparently, this new cut will be about a half-hour longer and be much more violent along with more sex.  (Rubs hands together...)<br /><br />It'll probably be released on home video in Sept. 2007.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Alex Lifeson commented during a radio interview several months ago how Snakes & Arrows was one of the quickest recordings since 1977's Farewell to Kings album, and the spontaneous takes and instant energies are beautifully detected on what marks another chapter in the Rush history. When you hear the fierce rockin' introduction followed by the griding guitar hooks on the lead song \\"Far Cry,\\" you immediately know that Rush are back. Like before, their words feel as if time is slowing down and make you ponder as Geddy Lee sings, \\"One day I feel like I'm on top of the world and the next it's falling in on me, but I can get back on.\\" Rush has reclaimed a light from their glory days throughout much of the album. As always, their songs continue to pose questions and draw conclusions with Neil Peart's common sense outlook mixed with philosophy. \\"Way the Wind Blows\\" reflects on appreciating the here and now as Lee sings, \\"We can only bow to the here and now or be broken blow by blow,\\" and \\"Faithless\\" is actually about having faith. \\"I don't have faith in faith, I don't believe in belief, you can call me faithless, you can call me faithless. I still cling to hope and I believe in love and that's faith enough for me,\\" make up the chorus. A great follow-up to 2002's Vapor Trails plus has the incomparable Rush sound all the way through. As they say in \\"Far Cry,\\" \\"You can almost feel the current flowing. You can almost see the circuits blowing.\\"
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I wasn't so sure about this album before listening to it.  Reviewers had been comparing it to Time Out of Mind and Love & Theft.  I do like Time Out of Mind despite it lacking the warmth found on the other album Dylan made with producer Daniel Lanois, Oh Mercy (which is among my favorite Dylan albums).  Love & Theft was, however, an album that I really do not like.  The songs on that album lack cohesion and the production is somewhat muddled. <br /> <br />Although Modern Times does not differ a great deal from Love & Theft, the difference lies first and foremost in the more direct melodies and a crystal clear but yet warm production.  From my standpoint, it is as if Love & Theft were from the same recording sessions, simply the songs on it were B-sides with all the worthwhile material making it to Modern Times. <br /> <br />The highlight of this album is Workingman's Blues #2, with subtle passion and emotion throughout.  Other highlights include Spirit on the Water, Beyond the Horizon and When the Deals Goes Down.  The only track resembling being a filler is Someday Baby. <br /> <br />This album is in mine opinion close to being as good as Oh Mercy.  The mystic sound that makes Oh Mercy so special (recorded in New Orleans) is, however, lacking.  That layered sound is probably among Lanois major contribution but he is nowhere to be found on Modern Times.  Despite the production being crystal clear, the music is so delicately played that it doesn't hinder the album from having a warm feeling.  This is Dylan's best record since Oh Mercy and among his best in his career.  At 65, he still has some magic left in him. <br />
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This brilliant series of interviews with Robert McNamara should be required viewing for *anyone* before he or she is authorized to venture an opinion regarding what America should or should not do with its power. I do not begin my review because of any clear sense of the virtue or villainy of Bob McNamara's legacy as president of the Ford Motor Company, Secretary of Defense under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and long-time president of the World Bank.<br /><br />Far from it, the spendidly drawn impression is how dangerously concentrated power becomes in the hands of fragile, myopic, regular men and women who in many--most?--cases want to do the right thing.<br /><br />McNamara's memory ranges from World War I to the extinction of River Blindness in Africa through the World Bank's efforts. For understandable reasons, the camera and the questions linger most on the Viet Nam era, for this is where McNamara took 'the world stage', as he puts it.<br /><br />Clearly enamored of John Kennedy, McNamara had a more complex relationship with Johnson, whom he admired but with whom he came to disagree in a process that led to McNamara's firing just shortly before Johnson made his epic decision not to run for reelection.<br /><br />As THE FOG OF WAR touches time and again upon the deliberations that framed the Bay of Pigs crisis and then the Southeast Asian war itself, one hears via the clarity of taped conversations how little we knew and, proverbially, how close we came to ultimate war.<br /><br />McNamara has passionate remarks to offer on the very timely matter of taking America's strength into battle when we have failed to convince our allies of that course.<br /><br />Kudos to McNamara for complicating his legacy even more by achieving astonshing things through some of the World Bank's better years.<br /><br />Required viewing.
B000O178BY|5.0|because this is one of the best showings of Reznor ever and might possibly be better than the Downward Spiral but I'm having trouble figuring that out. I'll be honest, after \\"Without Teeth\\" I thought Reznor was done and should retire. I HATED that album. It just seemed boring and rushed to me, even though it was years after \\"The Fragile\\". But seriously, the quality on this CD is fantastic, every song sounds unique to itself, the lyrics are fantastic and some of the songs are catchy, much like the Downward Sprial. This is classic NIN right here and if you liked the old NIN then I suggest you rush out and buy this thing now. And to all of you bashing this, open your friggin' eyes, no it's not as dark as NIN's early stuff but it's in the same class so stop panning this soon-to-be classic album.
B000OHZJ9Q|5.0|Porcupine tree is a band that is hard to categorize. They're music has evolved from far-flung spaced- out rave jams ( early 90's) all the way to their latest release ,which is more of a straight - on rock / prog attack. And an excellent one at that. On this album,the band explores the hollowing out of our youth by all the gadgets and electronic pacifiers at their disposal. This is a hard rocking album for P.T ( with notable exceptions on some tracks) and evokes a similar sound in places to Alice in Chains ( jar of flies) and Pink Floyd (dark side) but all buttoned up and expressed in only the way that Porcupine Tree can present it.  <br />The songs cascade, one from the other, in a meandering but structured sonic onslaught. Porcupine Tree's strength has always been in their layering of keybords and guitar, with subtle and somewhat dark lyrics. Fear Of A B.P. is no exception. This is music that needs to be explored as much as listened to. <br />After hearing this new release several times, I am convinced that it is destined to be a classic and, no doubt, a new pinnacle has been reached by P.T. <br />For anyone that is \\"on the fence \\" and unsure if they should purchase this, I would suggest doing so. The band deserves far more recognition than it has thus far recieved in the states.  <br />For new P.T. fans, it is an excellent introduction to the band and has a soundscape that is like nothing else out there. Enjoy... <br />
B00003CXD5|3.0|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a classic film starring one of the brightest stars of the era, Humphrey Bogart. Its themes are universal and timeless and the script features a line well known by the American culture. It follows three gold prospectors into the dirty desert where they mine tiny bits of gold. The threat of the elements, bandits, and each other slowly drive them apart and plant seeds of intense paranoia in their brains.<br /><br />It might seem pretty stereotypical to deem this movie a \\"man's film,\\" but really, that is what it is. The locations are far from beautiful, the actors are constantly unshaven and unclean, and the themes are about manhood. It isolates its audience, leaving women with little to relate to. I found it interesting in small sections but lacking as a whole.<br /><br />This DVD release features an entire disk filled with extra features including documentaries, trailers, and other goodies.<br /><br />I am sure that many people love this film and that it contains good acting, important themes, and great dialogue. However, my inability to relate to the events made it rather dull for me.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I saw her live last week and bought the DVD with the two audio CD's at the show.  She was amazing and she ROCKED!! The DVD will not be available until this fall, so save your money and get it!  I had no problems playing any of her CD's or the DVDs on my laptop.      Her voice is flawless live and she seems to sing so effortlessly.  The band members show they have a good times playing with each other and the camera men do a good job at catching the moments! I love seeing old traditional instruments from other cultures being played. I wouldn't enjoy a concert of synthesizers and voice overdubbing to sound ethereal, therefore,  I don't consider her new age. They do it the right way! The way it was done from the beginning.  The DVD has surround sound 5.1.  Pre order it and  if you can and do yourself a favor and see her live sometime.  Her shows are like her music, enchanting, powerful and plain fun!!!  Some songs did bring some wet eyes but they are suppose to if they are really good!    I love to play this CD when I am doing house work as it makes the mundane chores fly. I can dance and sweep at the same time. : ) and I play it before bed to relax. It works both ways!!  My favorites are \\"Penelopes Song\\" (reminiscent of \\"Dantes Prayer\\") ... oh forget it I love them all!  If you love her earlier recordings you will not be disappointed and if you never heard of her you will not be disappointed if you truly love music and culture.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I shall think, that most people considering buying this box set knows what \\"Band of Brothers\\" is about, so I'll sidestep that and move on another thing: the quality of the series. <br /> <br />Obviously it is very well written, directed and produced. Everything's been made to almost perfection. The images are crisp, the colour tone is perfect, the sound is good. But then again, you would expect that wouldn't you? Considering the people involved in the making.  <br /> <br />The series is very well cast and I can honestly say that I don't think there's even one case of bad acting in the entire ten episodes, which is actually quite rare. If I should say something, it would be that the casting of David Schwimmer is a bit off. He acts very well, but because of his \\"Friends\\" fame, I think one tends to associate him with his \\"Friends\\" persona. It's a minor thing, and as said, he acts very well.  <br /> <br />I've heard people say that they feel that they don't get to know any the characters and thus don't care what happens to them. I genuinely find that very hard to believe. Even with all the good things I've said about the production qualities of the series above, by far the best thing about \\"Band of Brothers\\" is that it truly is about brotherhood. You DO get to know the characters and you DO care about them, so much in fact that you sit there wishing you were there with them! Not because of the war, no, but because of these people and their friendship, their bond, their brotherhood. It is something that people who have never been to war can't fully appreciate I reckon, and we never will be able to. But \\"Band of Brothers\\" brings us one step closer to understanding it. No small feat indeed.  <br /> <br />It is without doubt the best TV series I have ever seen. It equals \\"Stalingrad\\" and surpasses \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" as far as WWII cinema goes.  <br /> <br />Highest possible recommendation.
B000O178BY|4.0|Trent once again mixes things up with Year Zero. A solid effort, but it may take a few listens before you can get into it. Trent comes across (in my opinion) as an artist more than a musician. His work is nothing short of Genius! This album may not be for the new NIN fan, but I would still recommend it. It remindes me of a mix between The Downward Spiral and With Teeth. Very thought provoking.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|The best Rush album since ...well probably Moving Pictures (1981) and one of the best albums this century. Every track is a killer tune and the production is second to none. Boy this is so good that it brings tears to my eyes. Can't wait to see them live and they'd better play some of the songs from Snakes & Arrows. It doesn't get much better that this - so 5 stars it is.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|I wanted so much to like this movie; its subject matter is of importance: pharmaceutical companies using Africa as a cheap place to conduct their morally ambiguous drug trials on humans. But the film was trying too hard to be so many things -- it's based on a book by John le Carr&eacute; so it was marketed as a global political thriller, yet they also wanted it to be this great love story and a documentary too. It wasn't able to pull that ambitious task off.<br /><br />The film, I can't give any lower than 3 stars. Its salvation is the shots of Africa's landscape and people. And that's the reason I give the DVD three and a half stars. It provides a record of Africa's beauty and grittiness. The DVD also includes the full length of the play in Kibera, the one where they use traditional storytelling techniques to educate people about HIV facts and myths.<br /><br />Other special features on the DVD:<br />Deleted Scenes - two of which I think should have been kept in the movie<br />From Page to the Screen - interview with le Carr&eacute; about how his book became a movie<br />Behind the Scenes - the decision to film in Kenya instead of in South America as originally intended<br />(ironically, the real British High Commissioner in Kenya supported the film crew there!)
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Being female and into prog since I was 12 and into Rush for the last 25 years, I can honestly say that Snakes and Arrows hits a bullseye with this long time fan. It's different (although I still hear bits of Vapor Trails and even older material like Hemispheres), refreshing (lots of almost Celtic sounding music), challenging but yet still very much a Rush creation with that infamous Rush sound. The producton is clean and sharp (unlike Vapor Trails more \\"muddy\\" sound)with the always insightful (almost hopeful?) Peart lyrics fans expect.  <br /> <br />Considering the uninspiring new Tree (that's my new nickname for Porcupine Tree) CD and the new disappointing effort from Marillion, Snakes and Arrows was a welcome treat. Enjoy!!
B000I2MRHE|5.0|The colors on the product are awesome, the blanket feels very soft and got different toys on the different paddles, I wished they'd make something bigger for adults like that *haha*! The spintable with it is very good sized, supercute im Ladybug design adn spins very easily! though not meant for Toddlers my son gave it a try to and the Spinner did not even squeach under his 42lbs, nor break and still spun if he managed to keep all of his much bigger then a Babies limbs of the floor!<br /><br />My 6 month old daughter still fits on this toy very well at almost 26inches tall and 17lbs. She is fascinated by the colors just like me and loves the mirror especially whis is on one of the paddles fixed on Velcro!<br /><br />Like my son she does not like Tummytime very much either,and this toy doesn't seem to make it much better, but htat has NOTHING to do with the Toy. She just doesn't like being on her Tummy, probably since she has reflux! The spintable is very well formed lower on the hippart and a tinybit higher where she shoulders go, so she doens't mind the spin table, she just does not like lifting  her head out of the floorposition, so she doesn't stay much longer on this one on her Tummy then she would otherwise but we'll keep trying!<br /><br />The flowermat I wished would be bigger, it is as big as described in the productlisting, but just for me I'm thinking to myself it wouldn't hurt to make the mat twice as big as it is, if a Baby doesn't like the spinner it can still use the beautyful flowermat for rolling around and checking things out ect.!<br /><br />I'd recommend it to anyone it really is worth trying just don't give up!
0380789035|4.0|The moment I finished the first chapter which included most of the back story, I had a truly difficult time putting down this book.  Each attempt to stop \\"on this page,\\" actually turned into that chapter actually.  The characters are intense, real, and easy to imagine.  The unlikely protaginst, Shadow, kept me guessing and wanting more.<br /><br />The writing is both eloquent and rough, serious and humorous, and most important, fun to read.  I found myself wondering what the next chapter would hold and giddily anticipating the next few pages.  The idea that each god embodied a human emotion, a personification of an action or ideal, or just the whole \\"Almighty One,\\" vibe was both funny and fascinating.  Gods who revel in fallibility and not only lack \\"moral\\" ideals, but mock those who falsely hold them.<br /><br />The story, plot, characters, and dialogue make this a great read.  But I agree with a fellow commenter, that a illustrated version will be awesome as well.<br /><br />-Shaun S.
B0006HB84Y|5.0|Every since I first saw Josh Groban on Ally McBeal, I was fascinated with his voice.  If you appreciate real talent this CD is a good pick.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Every Rush fan has their own conception of what the band's best work is. In almost every case, this is based on what time period that fan grew up in and discovered Rush. I, for example, find myself attached to the band's 80's material. Nevertheless, any true fan will find themselves enjoying Rush's material overall, from the 70s all the way to the present. And if you don't like a particular Rush album, just wait till the next one, as it is guaranteed to be different.<br /><br />Snakes and Arrows is no exception to this.<br /><br />For the most part, this album is the logical succession to the works released since 1993's Counterparts. What truly makes Snakes and Arrows stand out is the unique and refreshing use of acoustic instruments on almost every track. However, this is not \\"Folk Rush\\"! Nothing here, for instance, sounds like \\"Nobody's Hero.\\" Rather, the 6/12 string guitars, mandolin, mandola and bouzouki fill much of the space, and indeed, play much of the role that synthesizers once did. The musical coloring these instruments provide compensate for the lack of synths (although Geddy Lee does use a mellotron on this album - another new approach!). And production wise, the sound quality, mix and arrangements of these songs are perfect. The production is A+, and very reminiscent of Peter Collins (the best producer Rush ever worked with, in my humble opinion).<br /><br />Regarding individual performances, as always, each member shines: Neil Peart maintains his mantle of all-time percussion master, and his lyrics are very critical of the present state of the world. Geddy Lee's voice hasn't strained one bit with age, and, if anything, is becoming more and more accessible to those who are turned off by the \\"banshee wails\\" of his youth. His bass work, while prominent as always, takes on a deeper, fuller tone (though not muddy) and he seems to be giving the guitars more incentive to take the lead. Which leads me to the star of the album, Alex Lifeson. Not only does Alex branch out on new string instruments, but his lead work shows real maturity. His tone is excellent, and thank God he is no longer obsessed with whammy bar/vibrato overkill.<br /><br />Snakes and Arrows is ultimately just another Rush album that shows how \\"Canada's greatest export\\" still blows the competition way out of the water. This is not AOR Rush; repeated listenings are required to fully appreciate this effort, something I think many reviewers did not do prior to writing their review. All the instrumentals (three of them!) are great, and while \\"Far Cry,\\" the single, is superb, you'll also want to check out \\"The Way The Wind Blows,\\" \\"Bravest Face\\" and \\"We Hold On\\" for a good sampling of this album.<br /><br />On a final note to Rush fans: just buy it.does Alex branch out on new string instruments, but his lead work shows real maturity.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|I was a huge Rush fan through the 80s and early 90s.  On listening to Test for Echo I thought they had lost it big time & Vapor Trails did nothing to help.  The music was cold, lifeless, tuneless, over indulgent lyrics & a bit clueless. <br /> <br />Snakes & Arrows is very listenable & I genuinely love 8 of the 13 tracks. That in my book is as good as it gets.   <br /> <br />Credit where credit is due.  <br />
B000O75F7C|4.0|Let the record show that I'm a hardcore PT fan. Do I have all the limited vinyl's? Yup. All the rare releases? Yes. And almost everything else they've released? You better believe it. PT is one of my favourite groups (and still one of the best kept secrets in music), so accusations of my review being `ungrounded', or my opinion being `too stuck up' isn't really fair. Ok, now for the review...<br /><br />Right off the bat, once I had learned that FoaPB was going to be overtly political, I was a bit taken aback. Both the video, artwork and website all depict images of 'corrupted' individuals who have been (somewhat) conditioned by the media, and have consequently become mindless and destructive individuals. My depiction may be harsh, but that's the air I feel it projects. I'm slightly disappointed that SW has made political commentary that has been made since the 70s by everyone and their grandma. Granted, works off of Signify and In Absentia had political content, but FoaPB seems... well, too clich&eacute;d. The \\"oh, let's run from the media\\" and \\"we're all doomed\\" ethos that's embedded in the lyrics of FoaPB has been made by so pop stars, celebs and whatnot, that it just seems silly in a PT context.<br /><br />A lot of people on the PT board keep mentioning that it's great to \\"finally\\" hear someone say something like this, but come on, this concept has been flogged to death, over and over. And the only difference I can spot - not counting the music, simply the lyrics - is that Lasse Hoile has done some (beautifully) disturbing artwork to reinforce the message. Fortunately, though, the vocals blend into the overall mix of the album, so listening to the lyrics will take several tries before you fully understanding their role in the music.<br /><br />Aside from my gripes with the political nature of the album, the music is spectacular as always. Aside from \\"My Ashes\\" sounding too much like a Blackfield song (SW has a very Aviv Geffen tone), and \\"Anesthetize\\" wandering off here and there [a few of the guitar riffs seemed uncertain, Lifeson's solo was decent (if you like hearing a tremolo exercise) and why, oh why, did RB include indie-rock xylophone runs?], the latter half of the album is truly lush and hypnotic.<br /><br />The one standout song, in my humble opinion, was \\"Way Out of Here,\\" which, is one of the few group-written songs. The energy it contains carries an emotive force that'll completely knock you down a few times, while you try and figure out what's coming. It's viscous and awe-inspiring, and it's unfair to simply say this song is disjointed, due to the emphasis on extended riffs.<br /><br />Sadly, in no way is FoaPB a new chapter in PT's catalogue. Rather it feels like the end of what both In Absentia and Deadwing began - heavy, guitar pieces driven (well, bass and percussion, too). At points it feels like a temper-tantrum, where SW gets out all of the heavy metal energy that's brewing inside him. And at others it's truly cinematic.<br /><br />If you can put aside lackluster political commentary, you'll enjoy what PT has to offer. While it may not be their best, I can't wait to see what doors they'll go through next. Recommended 4.5/5off here and there [a few of the guitar riffs seemed uncertain, Lifeson's solo was decent (if you like hearing a tremolo exercise) and why, oh why, did RB include indie-rock xylophone runs?], the latter half of the album is truly lush and hypnotic. <br /> <br />The one standout song, in my humble opinion, was \\"Way Out of Here,\\" which, is one of the few group-written songs.

Rather it feels like the end of what both In Absentia and Deadwing began - heavy, guitar pieces driven (well, bass and percussion, too). At points it feels like a temper-tantrum, where SW gets out all of the heavy metal energy that's brewing inside him. And at others it's truly cinematic.  <br /> <br />If you can put aside lackluster political commentary, you'll enjoy what PT has to offer. While it may not be their best, I can't wait to see what doors they'll go through next. Recommended 4.5/5
B000O75F7C|3.0|I am not a lifelong Porcupine Tree expert like many of the reviewers here. I'm a late entrant to this game, and recently became a big fan of In Absentia and Deadwing (while dabbling in their earlier works too). It's true that this new album further explores the musical frontiers first envisioned on those albums, though these explorations don't always lead to great musical discoveries. This album is a good progression of the Porcupine Tree game plan, but much of the instrumental crunch and personal passion of the last two albums seems to be falling to professional competence and lyrical crankiness. The prime example is the album's centerpiece, the 17-minute \\"Anesthetize\\" which is not the slow-burn epic that it tries to be, instead descending into longwinded instrumental noodling and amateurish lyrics like \\"What's the point? What can money buy?\\" In fact, the lyrics throughout this album take on the aspects of some strange midlife crisis, with Wilson becoming obsessed with predictable platitudes about unhappy childhoods and media saturation. Good concepts to be sure, but they've been done much better elsewhere.<br /><br />Furthermore, Wilson has never had a very strong singing voice though he has traditionally been able to make a vocal impact with the band's strong instrumental skills as a backdrop. However, here that just doesn't work, as Wilson's songwriting seems to be divorcing itself from his vocal range. Fortunately, this album is saved by a few generally strong songs - particularly \\"Way Out of Here\\" which is the album's only track that integrates different musical styles (from new-age balladry to technical metal) as seamlessly as in the band's previous works, while the insistent opener \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" and the sinister closer \\"Sleep Together\\" are excellent reinforcements of Porcupine Tree's historical strengths. Unfortunately, overall this album leaves an impression of a passionate band, and their brilliant leader, settling into complacency and bitterness. In one song, Wilson sings \\"I never wanna be old,\\" but this album may indicate his inability to resist the inevitable. [~doomsdayer520~]ness.

1582701709|5.0|If you want a new way of thinking about life and the world, read this book.  The thesis of the book is stated very clearly in the first few pages, and the rest of the book is an exceptional follow-up to the thesis, explaining how it works in many aspects of life. <br /> <br />The thesis is simply the law of attraction: that like attracts like.  If you think something, it will happen.  Thoughts, like everything, are energy, and when emitted, will attract thoughts and actions with like energy.  (In simple terms: positive thinking attracts positive thinking and results.) <br /> <br />It is an easy read, and the most inspiring book I have read in a long time. <br /> <br />One final note:  If you think this book can and will work for you, it will.

B000NVIXFK|1.0|Snakes and Arrows . . . a much anticipated CD from my favorite group Rush.  I admit, I took the buildup hype hook line and sinker.  The youthful presence of  Nick \\"Foo Fighters\\" Raskulinecz was certainly going to energize these 3 great musicians to new heights . . . a proverbial kick in the pants to propel them forward after the production failure that was their previous effort- Vapor Trails.  <br /> <br />I was wrong.  Snakes and Arrow is an overwrought (for Rush), shoe horned, lyrically inane production that provides no memorable material of any kind from Rush.  <br /> <br />The opening song Far Cry is a semi catchy little piece that desperately screams for a ripping Alex Lifeson guitar solo at its midpoint, but alas the listener only gets another Alex LIfeson guitar lesson in atmospheric layering.  Still though, not a bad start.  <br /> <br />Then comes the next 4 monoliths (aka SwordAngelBowlDrift) of plodding, frankly boring songs had this long time Rush fan pining for the days when a Rush \\"side A\\" was a veritable treasure trove of hard/prog rock musicianship and execution.  Workin Them Angels is the most memorable tune of the this fourplex and that's not saying much.   <br /> <br />The rest of the non instrumental songs are just plain forgettable.  Which brings me to the instrumentals. <br /> <br />The best one by far is the Main Monkey Business, which is a small bite of Fillet Mignon in the boot leather tough piece of cube steak that is Snakes and Arrows.  <br /> <br />Production wise Snakes and Arrows is light years better than Vapor Trails.   <br /> <br />Lee, Lifeson and Peart certainly offer brief forays into some interesting musicianship on Snakes and Arrows, but by and large it's a been there done that expedition.  Snakes and Arrows tries to hard to be \\"progressively rootsy\\" and in turn that produces soul less, numbing music.  <br /> <br />Neil Peart used to be able to wrap symbolism and social comment into a rich storyline that would keep Rush geeks talking and exploring the content for days.  Now, Peart just takes out the hammer and tells the listener throughout Snakes and Arrows that world is bad place full of bad people who live behind iron gates and you best just run home and hide.  Lyrically Snakes and Arrows may go down as Peart's most inane, vapid and grooveless efforts ever with Rush.  In parts of Snakes and Arrows Lee's vocals almost have a \\"are you kiddin me with this stuff\\" subliminal undertone to them. <br /> <br />Maybe next time Rush and Nick R.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000K7VHQE|4.0|After reading previous reviews I will say that I don't understand why Allan Arkin got Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars this year.  However, his role was hillarious, if not controversial, and he fit in with the rest of the weird family of misfits.  Which is why the ending comes as no surprise.<br /><br />I saw this movie with a friend who thought the movie \\"sucked\\" while I thought it was an original screenplay with a refreshing end.<br /><br />Acting by all characters was superb.  Situations were one hillarious scene after the next, making the road trip from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach, CA one wild roadtrip.  I didn't think the family was all that dysfunctional, as I know many normal families like the one in this movie.  It was only the situations that brought out the dysfunctionality of the group dynamics.<br /><br />The little girl was a genuine lore of sunshine.  Her childish naivete give this movie a feel-good (if not outragious) aura.<br /><br />I certainly do look at ice cream with a different perspective since seeing this film.
0143036742|5.0|Rumours have it that Marina Lewycka's first novel was initially placed under \\"agriculture\\" on the book shelves. Ukrainian tractors don't sound like a good topic for a highly enjoyable reading experience. Yet it is! While a history of tractors features in the narrative as a sub-stream, the story really is about family - history and complex relationships across generations and cultures.  All those elements are packaged in a vivid, yet easy-going language, filled with humour and gentle satire.<br /><br />The story is set in the Ukrainian immigrant community in England and centres around Nicolai, a 84 year old widower who has set his eyes on a thirty-something, full-bosomed blonde Valentina, a would-like-to-be immigrant. His intention to marry her gets his two daughters onto the scene, anxious to stop such a mismatch. Despite their intense efforts and intrigues, however, their attempt to obstruct doesn't succeed.  \\"She exploded into our lives like a fluffy pink grenade...\\" Written from the perspective of Nadia, the younger of the two daughters, and through her discussions with \\"Big Sis\\" Vera, the reader follows the upheavals that this new reality in their fathers' life creates. Suspicions are rife that Valentina has plans beyond looking after a new husband and that Nicolai is being exploited in more ways than one. The sisters themselves carry baggage from the past that they need to put aside or resolve in order to show a united front to their father's situation.  In the process, events from the family history come to light that explain to some degree their different approaches to the problem at hand and different relationship each has had with their father and their late mother.<br /><br />At one level Lewycka's novel is just a fun read, a family saga that shines with lively dialogue and witty comments on the reality of the lives of the central characters.  At another level, she seamlessly integrates her reflections on aging and the needs and vulnerabilities of seniors and the challenges these present for the next generation to handle.  Finally, through flashbacks into Nikolai's life, the author provides the reader with insights into the family's background that makes the characters into who they have become. Nicolai and Valentina in particular come to live in the story and one can find parallels to people we all know.  All the parts are expertly joined so that these elements don't feel like overwhelming the primary storyline. A highly recommended book.

B00005JPAO|3.0|\\"The Queen\\" is only a portait of Queen Elizabeth.  That was established early on in the first scene when she is posing for the portait painter.  With that, we are warned that what follows is not going to be \\"truth\\" in as much as a biography or documentary.  It is the film's \\"impression\\" of the queen at a time when the monarchy was forced to accept the tragic events of Diana's death and to join with the rest of its subjects in grief.  Therefore, the portrait reminds us that the focus is squarely upon the Queen herself and no one else.  In spite of all the biographies about the British royal family, not one of them can be considered to have an authoritative perspective.  The Royal Family have endeavored for centuries not to allow daylight in upon the magic of monarchy.  They know that to do so would invite a host of trouble.  Such daylight upon magic would bring them all to Hector's and Hilda's, as Prince Philip stated in the fim.  It's a delicate balance that they must preserve.  So, what we get from this film is, as usual, merely an impression but certainly not the truth.  The stag motif, however, helps us to understand the message that lies beneath. <br /> <br />The stag is indeed an interesting additive, and it is the most intriging figure in the film.  Many viewers have interpreted the stag as a representation of Diana.  I can certainly understand the reasoning behind that interpretation.  However, let's go a little further into the stag motif.  If you miss the motif, you miss the connection.  I will say right now that the stag is not in fact Diana, but the Queen herself.  Why?  Let's review the number of times that verbal references to \\"stag\\" are made and that crucial time when the stag appears. <br /> <br />When the Queen walks down a long corridor at Balmoral to take a call from the Prime Minister, notice the stag heads mounted on the walls along that corridor.  The stag is therefore connected with \\"monarchy\\" or imperialism. <br /> <br />Just before the stag appears in the river scene, the Queen is sitting down.  She has had a car accident because she was driving too fast along a rocky road and is now stranded in the river.  She begins to cry.  Then she turns and sees the stag.  The Queen is an active deer stalker, and that is what has kept her in such good physical shape to this day.  She identifies with deer.  And in the scene when the stag appears, he seems to identify with her.  Both the Queen and stag establish eye contact with each other, hence the camera closeup on the stag as he gazes at her and she at him.  She calls him \\"a beauty,\\" because to her he is something ethereal, magical, and \\"otherworldly\\" just as monarchy is to the public.  The stag is a sacrificial figure in this scene, although the Queen does not quite see him as sacrifical at that point.  To her, he is \\"a beauty\\" only.  She will later learn what he represents to her. <br /> <br />After the princes hear of the news of their mother's death, Prince Philip encourages them to take out their anger on a stag that has been known to appear on the 40,000-acre property of Balmoral.  To Philip the stag is nothing more than a deer.  He never quite gets the significance of the stag's meaning.  When Philip tries to get the boys out in the fresh air for deer stalking, the stag managed to elude them.  The stag has wandered off to neighboring property.  He has left the Balmoral estate. <br /> <br />Later in the film, Prince Philip tells the Queen that the stag has been shot on neighboring property by a banker who had come out for a day's shooting. <br /> <br />The Queen drives over to the neighboring property to see the stag in the cleaning room.  There he hangs by his hind legs.  He has been decapitated, and that's an important point.  The caretaker tells the Queen that the stag is a 14-pointer, an \\"imperial.\\"  It is there in that room that the Queen releases her emotions.  She hopes that \\"he did not suffer much\\" when the shooting party had to follow him for milesbefore finishing him off.  She begins to identify with the stag even more in this scene.  She understands that the stag has been sacrificed.  I think she now begins to see herself as a sacrifical object.  As she examines the stag's head on the table in the cleaning room, she touches the point on the stag's cheek where he has been wounded.  She identifies with the stag even more at this point.  She looks at the head, no doubt remembering all the beheaded kings and queens in the historical past, and she probably recalls how important it is to connect with her people at a time when she is so reluctant to do so.  The \\"stag,\\" as the Queen, is going to be brought down, but for a purpose.  And she learned that she had to modernize, to reinvent the monarchy in order to reconnect with her people with whom she had been so out of touch. <br /> <br />The Queen feels a connection with this stag, precisely at a time when she herself is being \\"hunted and brought down\\" by a citizenry who demands her presence in London for Diana's funeral.  She is finally brought to her knees when she is forced to deliver an address to the nation about Diana.  But she is not accustomed to demands.  She is as vulnerable as the stag.  She vainly tries to remain elusive at Balmoral but to no avail. <br /> <br />Like the stag and like Diana, the Queen is also a hunted figure by her subjects.   <br /> <br />Thanks to all who read this, and I hope you reply to my review with thoughts of your own. <br /> <br />
B00005JPPI|2.0|I was trying to answer a question about what movies I'd seen recently.  When I said I'd seen \\"Fracture,\\" my mind went blank; and I couldn't remember who was in it or what it was about.  I decided that if I reviewed it, maybe it'd come back to me.  The title and the film seem disconnected to me.  I'm sure there was a connection between the word \\"Fracture\\" and the picture, but it sounds like something Hitchcock would have directed.  Now \\"Shot in the Head\\" might have brought back what Ted Crawford does to his wife Jennifer.<br /><br />Director Gregory Hoblit made a name for himself as the Executive Producer of the TV series \\"NYPD Blue.\\"  He directs this stylish thriller that has the suspense of a chess match, brainy but not that interesting to watch.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkin will probably always be identified with his amazing Oscar-winning performance from \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"  So many of his characters seem like variations on that spooky character.  Ryan Gosling was a great rebel romantic in \\"The Notebook\\" and received an Oscar nomination for \\"Half Nelson\\" last year, which I know at least 24 people have seen.  As DA Willy Beachum, he's too flawed to be entirely likeable, but one does admire the character's perseverance.  Embeth Davidtz plays Crawford's wife Jennifer in a brief appearance.  Her role in the small film \\"Junebug\\" was filled with energy.  Her face is one that leaves you trying to recall where you'd seen it.  While I couldn't come up with \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" or \\"Schindler's List\\" anymore than I could recall the movie \\"Fracture\\" when asked, she does a nice job as the wife of the wealthy but cold Ted Crawford.  One really can't blame her for seeking out police negotiator Rob Nunnally played by Billy Burke, who I did recognize from one of my favorite episodes of TV's \\"Monk.\\"  Burke does a good job of playing the distraught lover, although one wonders how one used to being in the middle of crisis events suddenly loses it on the courtroom steps.  David Strathairn turns in another amazingly tightly controlled performance that is well suited to this film, brainy but boring, or \\"Good Night & Good Luck.\\"<br /><br />My favorite part of the film was Rosamund Pike as high-powered lawyer Nikki Gardener.  Hoblit takes us to the Gardner family's home for Thanksgiving, which introduces us to her father, a judge, but also allows Pike to show numerous levels between the professional and the personal family life.  Her face is familiar from double-o-seven's \\"Die Another Day,\\" \\"Pride & the Prejudice\\" and \\"The Libertine.\\"  [I think was one of the 24 people who actually watched \\"The Libertine\\" all the way to the end!]<br /><br />\\"Fracture\\" really fractured for me at the end.  Without giving any spoiler, it seemed that someone as bright as Ted Crawford would surely be able to have contemplated the lame-brained technicality with which Beachum wraps up the plot & assures us that good guys win.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|NOTE to fellow RUSH fans-  Rush albums have always reflected the sound of the times and \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is no exception so you need to keep that in mind!  I'm shocked a few of the reviewers don't remember this history. If you discovered Rush during the late seventies circa Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, Permanant Waves I suspect you're gonna like this CD.<br /><br />BEST BETS- Far Cry, Armor & Sword, Workin Them Angels and The Larger Bowl, plus Main Monkey Business (instrumental- could get a Grammy nomination like YYZ did).<br /><br />For those of you hoping for a MOVING PICTURES part II or POWER WINDOWS squared effort this CD may not always ring your bell.  S&A is very well done, but- the sound is thick, background ambience is done with instrumental effects (sorry no synth leads SIGNALS fans), and lead guitar breaks with screaming solos are few and far between (sorry GRACE UNDER PRESSURE fans).  I do guarantee fans of the 80's era will like this CD more than Vapor Trails or Test For Echo.  There are some great riffs, acoustic lead breaks, big sound segments & drum fills in many tracks which give S&A great variety and the distinctive RUSH sound.<br /><br />THE LYRICS- well they are a bit of downer for the most part.  It's now ten years since Neil lost his wife and daughter- maybe understandable, I can't imagine the pain.  But I honestly wonder if at some point Neil may be at risk of imposing the same fate upon himself.  I hope not but maybe Geddy and Alex can pen a few songs next time just for change of pace.<br /><br />PRODUCTION- I heard this Nick guy did Foo Fighters so  expected he would have more of an influence getting the songs to flow better.  A couple of these tunes sound really great and just when a hook is in- it diverges to a awkward lyric or different melody that would fit in another tune.  The recording is clean and can be played very loud.<br /><br />CONCLUSION- despite some nitpicking, the quality of these arrangements and musicianship far exceeds that of most music of the 2000 era. Really- can anyone name a newly formed rock band on the radio today which will be given enough leeway to be relevant say 10 years from now?  Sorry, it's a quick hit American Idol world.  So it's pretty amazing  three Canadian guys in their 50's can produce such a modern edge for young bands to aspire to.  We should be thrilled they've been updating their sound this way for 30+ years. Except for probably U2, I can't think of another rock band I grew up listening to that is still putting out relevant music. Think about it folks...Genesis, Yes, Journey, Styx, Bowie, Eagles, Van Halen?...nope. Also, shame on The Police for scheduling a tour without any NEW material and expecting us to pay big bucks for the privilidge to see them replay the Syncronicity tour setlist.<br /><br />MY SNAKES & ARROWS RATING is 3.5 stars and rising towards 4 stars. After each listen I find another riff that sticks in my head which I'd like to hear live this summer.  For reference my 'RUSH' scale is:  Caress of Steel-2 stars, Hold Your Fire-3 stars, Permanent Waves-4 stars, Moving Pictures-5 stars.Really- can anyone name a newly formed rock band on the radio today which will be given enough leeway to be relevant say 10 years from now?

075640407X|5.0|Hello, George R.R., Bob Jordan and Mr. Goodkind! The FIRST volumes of your overlong, multivolume epics remind me of THIS ONE! I guess Mr. Rothfuss has read your works, and decided: \\"Let's get to the point, for crying out loud!\\" <br /> <br />This entertaining and unusual fantasy speeds along--even though much of it takes place in flashbacks. Instead of introducing a new character (or three) every other chapter, the author concentrates on the protagonist, Kvothe. And he is worthy of the attention.  <br /> <br />A legend in his own time, he's hiding out in an obscure inn--but why? A teller of tales locates him unexpectedly...and Kvothe tells him his story. He has three days to tell it, and this first volume is just one day. <br /> <br />This is a lively, engaging, often hilarious, frequently moving story. I highly recommend it to fantasy fans who are ready for something fresh--and not quite so self-indulgent as the 7, 8, 9 volume heavyweights we've been reading. <br /> <br />I pray that Mr. Rothfuss sticks to his principals--and keeps this to three volumes. I hope that the second two are as great as the first!

All glibness aside <too late>, Funeral is one of my three favorite albums of all time.  It was a perfect mixing of both sorrow and joy.  that seems to be a combination that works for them.  But this album comes off as petulant and angry, which is really shocking when compared to the tone of Funeral.      This album makes me sad more than it makes me feel anything else.  Not because the music stirs my emotions; but because it's sad to see a band so good do something so bitter.
B000LE0TGA|4.0|Jeff Lynne was always a master tunesmith, but even at his best ([[ASIN:B00005KHET Eldorado]] and [[ASIN:B000F8O4E0 Face the Music]]), he often tripped over his classical predelictions. \\"Out Of The Blue\\" was the climactic moment where Lynne's determination that pop music pinnacled at \\"I Am The Walrus\\" matched his classic experiments perfectly, and he was just beginning to let go of his rock and roll visions. (Even if the next tour was the infamous Spaceship Stage extravaganza.)<br /><br />This is the album that yielded two flawless pop singles, \\"Turn To Stone\\" and \\"Mr. Blue Sky,\\" inescapable some 30 years later. But Lynne also wanted to try out his inner \\"Abby Road\\" with the side long \\"Concerto For A Rainy Day.\\" It flows like a good song suite should, more so than \\"Eldorado\\" did, and climaxed with \\"Mr. Blue Sky.\\"<br /><br />\\"Out Of The Blue\\" is loaded with moments of pop perfection. You can hear Lynne's evolution into Travelling Wilburys territory on \\"Across The Border\\" and \\"Birmingham Blues.\\" His fascination with the American west (think \\"Poker\\" and \\"Down Home Town\\") on \\"Wild West Hero.\\" His melancholy also comes to the fore on \\"hero\\" and \\"It's Over.\\"<br /><br />I will be one of those who is actually pleased with the remastering. The highs are a lot crisper and the soundstage seems to be broader. The annoying dropouts that plagued the previous CD are all but gone. This is the best version of \\"Out Of The Blue\\" yet. Don't be scared off by the audio-snobs - this is a brillant pop album and deserves a space in your CD collection if you're an ELO fan.
B000058983|2.0|Those pop culture curators and preservationists over at Rhino usually do a fantastic job of remastering and repackaging old classics for the new century (see, for example, the excellent reissues of The Stooges, Gram Parsons, The Cure, etc.).  Unfortunately, they completely and totally butchered the sound on this otherwise fantastic folk-psychedelic gem. <br /> <br />I am not an audiophile so forgive my non-technical description but basically they cranked up the bass which muddies and overwhelms the vocals, guitars, horns, and strings--essentially all other sounds.  Further diminishing the sound is their unnecessary separation of said instuments: you have the acoustic guitars isolated to, and hence, coming out of only the left speaker, the horns coming out the right one, etc.  This has the effect of providing neither good mono nor good stereo but some sort of crappy offspring of both. <br /> <br />Given the fact that the bonus tracks are ho-hum at best, you'd do best to seek out the now out-of-print original issue.  It's cheaper and the sound quality is better by some distance.  (I'll give the Rhino folks one mulligan or two, but please don't ever ruin one of my favorite albums like this again!)

Her love for Mr. Bently and his for her, make this book even more enthralling, especially as it all unfolds.<br /><br />Mrs. Bingly is a vital character in this book as well, as she covers jealousy, treachery to certain extent, caniving, and even back-stabbing. Of course she wants Mr. Darcy for herself.<br /><br />Jane Austen created memorable characters that each become a major part of this story! From her Father, Mr. Bennett, to the rediculous Mr. Collins and from Mrs. Bennett to the very silly Lydia. She even goes into detail about how things end up for the characters she created, at the end of the book! Great writing!<br /><br />This story also is an awesome detail of what it was like in the 1700's for families and women. Jane did not deal with the political side of life in this book. Some reviews from famous author's were disappointed that the book did not contain any information about what the men did for a living, but that was not Jane's intention. It didn't matter what they did for a living. They \\"went to town on business\\" was enough information. You come to understand that women didn't marry for love much, as in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. It was a convenience to be married for many. It also showed how important it was for families to have sons.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and the movie. You will not be disappointed. It is a great read, over and over.
0618680004|5.0|Hey, after reading this book, I'm still not 100% sure where I stand, but I think that's okay.  I am much more trusting and comfortable with someone who freely admits that he or she does NOT have all the answers than someone who thinks he or she is right \\"because the bible told them so.\\"  One section that was particularly meaningful to me was when Dawkins wrote about how we should teach children to think critically and make their OWN choices about things.  That is certainly an ideal I would like to aim for with my toddler son as he grows older.  Again, not sure if I am completely ready to \\"come out\\" as an atheist, but I did find myself nodding my head in agreement more often than not while reading this outstanding, thought-provoking book.  Dawkins helped me to understand evolution a little better (my background is in psychology) and absolutely convinced me that it is quite possible to be a moral, caring, and optimistic person without having to believe in a \\"creator\\" per se.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|I won't pour bile over this record, but I'll say that it's definitely not as strong as some of their past efforts... Too bad, I really wanted to like this album - I have lost touch with Rush since \\"Hold Your Fire\\" (been a while) but I cannot. In my honest opinion, it's lacking direction and cohesiveness. It's not totally terrible, as some reviewers suggest, but far from \\"amazing\\" as many others insist.
038073186X|2.0|I had never read a Dennis Lehane book, but having loved the movie version of Mystic River, I was so looking forward to this novel.  But I have to agree with the reviewer who called it \\"a cheap parlor trick.\\"  The ending is  obvious to anyone who paid attention to the clues. And Lehane might as well have prefaced each clue with a note: THIS IS A CLUE, they were so transparent.  The writing for most of the novel is pedestrian, the plot mechanical and the characters cardboard.  The only redeeming part of the novel are the final 50 or so pages.  Yes, I admit that the final 50 pages make clear why the rest was so pedestrian, mechanical and cardboard, but to ask a reader to wait so long just to get to decent writing is too much.  And, in the case of this book, for far too little payoff; since it's very easy to figure out what's really happening  about halfway through the book, the reader knows just how much weight to give -- or not to give --  anything in the plot or the writing style long before those final, tell all 50 pages.<br /><br />In hindsight, I wished I'd read one of his PI novels.  Or even Mystic River, although I already know the story.  Perhaps I will give those books a try.  But for this book, it would have been better if I had left the shutters down.

0393327345|4.0|Since the first rule of Fight Club is that you don't talk about Fight Club, I guess I shouldn't be writing this review. Oh well, let those chips fall as they may.    After many, many viewings of the movie, I finally convinced myself to check the book out.    I'll start out by saying that I truly enjoyed the book. Of course I did, the movie did an excellent job of capturing the nuances and the feeling of the book almost exactly. That being said, at times reading it, I really didn't feel (for almost the first time ever) that reading the book really was all that necessary for me. Either Chuck Palahniuk had his finger in the pot the entire time that the movie was being made, or the director felt that the only way to bring such an amazing novel to the screen was to put it on film as close to word for word as the medium would allow.    If you've seen Fight Club more than a few times, reading the novel really won't give you any additional insight into the world of Tyler Durden. However, if you haven't seen the movie and want an interesting perspective on movie theaters, catering/waiters and making soap, then give Fight Club a try.
0316010669|5.0|`Blink' is about the mysterious two seconds it takes to develop a first impression and how surprising the impression often is, given our known preferences and tendencies. Malcolm Gladwell got the idea for this book after he had let his hair grow long on a whim, and found he was getting speeding tickets for the first time in his life. He wondered why the cops all of a sudden had an impression of him that wasn't there before. He became curious: where do first impressions come from anyway?    Gladwell does some interesting investigative work to try to get some answers to that intriguing question. He suggests that `rapid cognition' is behind a `closed door' in our minds and follows certain unwritten rules. It is a logical process that he feels is not instinctual, but, surprisingly, can be more accurate than deliberate, rational thought, and follows certain rules that we are not even aware of.  (Even improvisational comedians follow certain rules, though what they do often seems so random.) One must be careful though, since stereotyping and the immediate environment at the moment can influence the impression. All of this mental background action is going on without our even knowing it!  The `closed door', it turns out,  can only be peaked into.    There are lots of very good examples of `blink'. There is the case of the statue that didn't look right to experts at first glance.  Fourteen months later, after much testing, it was discovered by other experts that the statue was a forgery. Then there was the case of the supervisory fireman who yelled to his men to leave the building immediately minutes before it collapsed; he sensed something was wrong when it was not at all obvious what it was. Another example has to do with internationally known and respected tennis instructor who can almost invariably tell when a pro will double-fault just before the serve is hit, and he doesn't know how he does it!  Speed dating often shows people being attracted others that do not fit their criteria of what they are looking for, for reasons they are fuzzy about. All of this is very mysterious, to say the least.      Information and understanding are not the same things and sometimes less information is better. He gives very good examples of this in the medical and military fields. He talks about the `power of the glance', the ability of a great general to look at a battle field, weed through all the information, and make a rapid decision; he gives a great example of this in Lee's improbable victory at Chancellorsville.  \\"Sometimes, we have to edit\\" our information down to something manageable, and make a decision on that. This was very counter-intuitive to me, and I'm sure, something to approach with caution. But I can't argue against results and he gives good evidence that it works.    Be aware that first impressions can be misleading. Spontaneous decision making is shown to be not infallible, and can even be dangerous at times; stereotyping can supplant logical decision-making in a time-crunch. He goes into some detail about this with an instructive example of a police action in the Bronx that went awry. Gladwell said in the interview at the end of the book that he tried very hard to make this point. Rapid cognition can be your enemy as well as your friend. Use it with caution.    It is tricky knowing how to measure the value of a product or a performer.  Packaging can count too much, a great example of which is what he calls the `Warren Harding Error', a fascinating section of the book. Also, when surveying the response to a product, an opinion can't always be comfortably expressed in words (except by the experts), and as a result, some people will tend to look for a plausible reason, and give an incorrect opinion. The mystery of why someone likes something can't always be codified.    This was a fascinating book that does not pretend to give all the answers but does raise some really good questions about a mysterious and important subject.  Theso-called `locked door' is finally getting its due.
0060764899|4.0|After reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for the first time at age 31, I sat and asked myself what I really thought of it. I think one of the main things that I felt was disappointment. Not in the book itself, but mainly with myself for not reading it when I was much younger. I truly enjoyed the tale that Lewis has woven, but I think that a lot of the magic is lost by reading it for the first time as an adult. <br /> <br />The story itself is solid and I enjoy the narrative tone of it and the references back to the reader by the author as he tells his tale. As an adult, I did notice a fair amount of simplicity in the writing (I'm used to reading novels with much more detail) but not in a negative way. Overly wordy and descriptive narrative can sometimes undermine the smooth flow of a simple story line, and that might have been the case here had Lewis gotten too detailed. <br /> <br />I am looking forward to continuing my maiden voyage into Narnia and am eagerly waiting to see what adventures lie ahead. <br />

0060005696|5.0|This is a book about the mountainous heaps of choices those of us in the modern world face in our daily lives:  from surfing the internet, to choosing groceries, to selecting a major, to picking a TV show to watch, to picking a book to read.<br /><br />I thought this book was simply going to be an analysis and extended complaint about this situation, but it turns out to be much more.  The final third of the book is actually more self-help than psychology:  it contains very useful practical advice for how to make decisions in the face of oppressively numerous options.<br /><br />I thought the book to be not only entertaining, but enormously useful.  Another title for it could have been \\"How to Save Yourself a Whole Lotta Time and Money.\\"
B000006OAM|5.0|Some critics have claimed that Ophelia is a pretentious and depressing album. I don't see the pretense in it; these songs are hardly as preachy as some of Natalie's from her 10,000 Maniacs days. Yes, the songs are for the most part gloomy (putting aside \\"Kind and Generous\\") but it is in keeping with the title of the album-- OPHELIA.  <br />Natalie's work has always been low-key. If you accept that, you can appreciate this as a beautiful and compelling album. Best songs are My Skin, Kind and Generous (let's not be so cynical), Thick as Thieves, and Ophelia. But all are well crafted and worth listening to. Definitely stronger than Tigerlily.

0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert hits the nail on the head.  Beauty, faith and the <br />balance between both.  For those of us facing the proverbial mid-life <br />crisis, or even wondering, is that all there is, Ms. Gilbert delivers <br />a book with legs.  For travelers, the three venues, all so different, <br />provide that thrilling look inside a city we may never get four months  <br />in which to wander about.  For the soul searchers among us, Ms. Gilbert <br />offers insight into the mind of a woman (most women) looking for answers  <br />in the chaos of love, lost love, rediscovered love, and most significantly <br />a connection with the spirituality of all things past and present tucked <br />neatly away in the heart.  The trick is to tap into the heart.  This is reason enough for India to be my favorite section of the book.  Makes you want to go to an Ashram doesn't it?   <br /> <br />

B00005JPAO|5.0|Saw the film in the theaters, bought the (pricey) DVD when it came out. That's because this film is especially well-crafted by all the participants. <br /> <br />Helen Mirren goes as an actress all the way down into her body to come up with perfect pitch. <br /> <br />Jim Cromwell as Prince Phillip understands perfectly what a rotter, and how utterly damaged as a human being, Prince Phillip is. Chap who plays his son has the tension in the family, and the POW's inability to break through the \\"enchanted glass\\" of a family romance, upon which rests such a weight of memory, down pat. <br /> <br />The phrase \\"The Enchanted Glass\\" is from an excellent book by Tom Nairn about the subconscious of monarchy, and the way that Britain is more or less stuck with it absent a disaster such as happened to the Hapsburgs. <br /> <br />Mirren and Cromwell document the passing of an era dominated by the unadmittedly fearful shadow of what had happened to Britain and Britons in WWII and the long years after of rationing and the end of Empire. <br /> <br />The film documents a moment of hope which was reversed when Britain realized that its financial markets, and hence its foreign policy, were in thrall to the USA and went roaring in the old style into Iraq. <br /> <br />To its credit the film does not document a transformation in Elizabeth so much as a moment of greatness when the \\"real\\" Queen realized the truth of Charles de Gaulles' advice to her when young, and this was to realize that she was in for a life sentence, and thereby to understand that a Constitutional monarch's lot is not a happy one. She had to represent the gay men and the fat chaps sleeping on the streets, she had, in a minor key, to imitate Emperor Hirohito when he got on the radio to say that \\"Japan must endure the unendurable and suffer the insufferable\\" in 1945. <br /> <br />She had to surrender to time and change, and a Britain no longer in thrall to the posh alone. <br /> <br />She realizes how dismayed her father was when his own elder brother bugged out in 1937 and how the stresses of being George VI may have killed her Dad, who smoked himself to death. <br /> <br />The film is an elegant lesson in the meaning of the unwritten British constitution, right down to the strange way in which hierarchies parallel each other, with Blair's men meeting with court flunkeys who spend two hours arguing the merits of a gun carriage as an hearse for a Princess no longer, don't y'know, a Princess. <br /> <br />What we need next is a film treatment of the Princess who here appears only as herself in film clips, but Parliament needs to pass a law that a certain Madonna Ciccione from the USA is not to be allowed anywhere near the casting couch for that role: I say this because that woman, who is talented in certain regards but not in others, destroyed filmdom's chances to bring Evita Peron to life on the silver screen. Elton John in drag, or any number of gay chaps, would do a better job as Princess Diana in the same way boys played Cleopatra in Shakespeare's day. <br /> <br />This treatment may start up as a Broadway and West End musical but if you ask me, only first-rate actors and writers should be allowed anywhere near this subject. The tastefulness of The Queen shows what happens below blockbuster level where the makers of the film aren't bullyragged as they are in movies aimed at 14 year olds. <br /> <br />A xenophile can see a \\"foreign\\" film (although British films are not really all that \\"foreign\\" to Americans save self-moronized Texans) and get all patriotic for the wrong country: this happens to the sensitive chap in watching the Gance Napoleon. I can only hazard that this film will manufacture consent to the (relatively) harmless, if rather pricey, institution of the Monarch, although it gives some time, but short shrift, to Cherie Blair's Jacobite sympathies. <br /> <br />The moral is don't fix it if it isn't broke, and the adventure of Iraq demonstrates that flawed institutions should never be replaced unless absolutely necessary.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I didn't buy any other album in 2004 because of Thirteenth Step.  Hypnotic bass and drum rhythms mix with guitar that is alternately peaceful and aggressive.  Add in Maynard's voice with dream-like lyrics on top and you get an all-around awesome record.  Softer songs like \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" help break up the aggressive, smash-your-head-through-a-brick-wall sounds that come out in songs like \\"The Outsider.\\"  The songs often build from foggy, dream-like moods to an inevitable critical mass where they explode out of the speakers.  This is one of my top ten albums.
B000O174CM|5.0|For those of you who aren't familiar with DREAMGIRLS it was a hit Broadway musical, created in 1981, based \\"loosely\\" on the real monster girl group The Supremes, Berry Gordy and Motown. And although it took almost 25 years to make, the movie version is spectacular.<br /><br />Following the meteoric rise of the fictitious \\"Dreams,\\" the story takes place in Detroit in 1962 and ends in Los Angeles in 1975. In between you witness the joy, sorrow and bitterness--as some dreams die, while others live. And being a period movie, DREAMGIRLS doesn't feel dated or unrealistic. It captures the excitement and turbulence of the 60s or at least the romanticized ideal of it...perfectly.<br /><br />Anyway enough about the movie and on to the DVD.<br /><br />This dvd set contains two dvds:<br /><br />***DVD #1 FEATURE FILM; 12 EXTENDED/ADDITIONAL MUSICAL NUMBERS<br /><br />I won't list the 12 songs but the title track \\"Dreamgirls\\" and the show stopper \\"And I Am Telling You...\\" are not part of this 12. With the exception of the song \\"Effie, Sing My Song,\\" at least from what I could tell, most of these musical numbers are just different edits/film cuts than those that made it into the film. For instance, you'll see more of the performance rather than the cutaways to other scenes, which you see in the movie...so they're not sung differently.<br />What's good about this is that you get to see the entire performance of the opening acts(The Stepp Sisters, L'il Albert and The Tru-Tones, Tiny Joe Dixon) without the cutaway shots that show what's going on behind the stage. No additional lyrics: the songs are exactly as they are on the deluxe edition music cd of [[ASIN:B000JLQQ2G Dreamgirls: Music From The Motion Picture [2-CD Deluxe Edition]]].<br />One alternative musical number that's very different is the song \\"Effie, Sing My Song.\\" In the movie, the lines are spoken. However they did film the song version where C.C. and Effie share a duet. And that's included here.<br /><br />***DVD #2 DOCUMENTARY ON THE MAKING OF DREAMGIRLS; ORIGINAL AUDITION AND SCREEN TEST VIDEOS; FEATURETTES ABOUT THE FASHION, FILM EDITING, THEATRICAL LIGHTING; PRE-VISUALIZATION SEQUENCES; IMAGE GALLERY<br /><br />In all fairness, I haven't seen the entire second dvd. The reason being is that the documentary on the making of DREAMGIRLS is nearly TWO-HOURS long! Running at one-hour and fifty-five minutes, the documentary called \\"Building the Dream\\" chronicles the journey that started as an idea from Broadway creators Tom Eyen, Henry Krieger, and Michael Bennett to finally becoming the most hyped and anticipated film of 2006. But don't worry, that's not the beef of the documentary. Most of it takes you behind the scenes of what it took to put this huge movie together from the set design to the casting; from the choreography to staying true to the original score.<br />It's a fascinating look at the challenges director Bill Condon faced when deciding to take on this project. I always thought that \\"Dreamgirls\\" would've been easy to make into a film because you already started with everything in place. How wrong I was! Not only are you competing in a genre not too popular today, but you have to compete with the beloved original. Well, I must pay homage to Condon. He pulled it off.<br />Anyway, the documentary is told through home video of the recording sessions, casting calls, set design, rehearsals etc., as well as  principal cast member interviews and of course the main people working behind the scenes like director Condon, executive producers, choreographers, music producers etc.<br /><br />If nothing else, this documentary alone is worth the extra price for the two-set dvd of DREAMGIRLS.<br /><br />And for those of you die hard fans of the original Broadway show or soundtrack, who liked this movie version, will be happy to know that the song \\"A'int No Party\\" is supposed to be included in the \\"audition tapes\\" section of the special features. There is a snippet of it in the documentary and Anika Noni Rose was working that song. So I'm sure it has to be included in the screen tests. But even if it isn't, remember I haven't seen the entire second dvd, the documentary \\"Building The Dream\\" makes up for it.<br /><br />Anyway, if you enjoyed the movie, you'll enjoy this dvd set. It's a dream that will give you \\"more and more.\\" If you haven't seen the movie, well you're in for a treat. It's exciting and keeps you at the edge of your seat.

B00005B36H|4.0|The first time I listened to the disc, I wondered if I was going to like it the second time around.  The funny thing is that this album grows on you, meandering progressions and ultra-long tracks and all.  The album definitely takes patience to enjoy in its entirety, which is the way it is best enjoyed.  Not that it matters that much, but the album art is the most original and interesting I have ever seen, reminiscent of the Invisible Woman I used to play with at my grandparents' house.
B000031XBQ|5.0|I bought this cd for a couple of reasons.  I am learning Spanish and knew I would enjoy the latin versions of these famous tunes; and, this weekend I'm going to see the hit musical \\"Mamma Mia\\" (saw it a few years back and LOVED it!!!) and I know this cd will get me revved up for the fun!<br /><br />This cd contains several of my favorite ABBA songs---\\"Chiquitita\\", \\"Fernando\\", \\"La Reina del Baile\\" (Dancing Queen), \\"Estoy Sonando\\" (I Have a Dream) and \\"Mamma Mia\\" to name a few.  In Spanish the songs retain all the charm and great pop sound of their English counterparts.  You will not need to know Spanish (I know very little!) to enjoy the music.  Good music will transend any language and it is certainly true of this set of chart topping 70s hits!<br /><br />After hearing this cd, I am planning on buy \\"Mas Oro\\", another collection containing more latin music from ABBA. I definitely recommend this to ABBA fans!
B000HEWEEE|5.0|Okay, this was really a nice film. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock haven't lost their on chemistry, yet. Reeves plays an architect who is having some hard times with his father. While Bullock plays a doctor, who is just moving on with her life. But, their lives seem to be connected with this glass lake house. Reeves is just moving into it, while Bullock just moved out from it. Somehow, the two of them manage to fine one another through some letters and began a correspondance.(Done by this magical mailbox). Which blooms into a romance of sorts. However, there is one problem. They are living two years apart. Reeves is in 2004 and Bullock in 2006. The romance somehow begins to really shape thier lives and in the process, which will lead them. To have a chance encounter, which will change their lives either for the good or the bad.

'Bridge over Troubled Waters'  'Sounds of Silence''Mrs. Robinson' 'Scarborough Fair' are truly classical songs which play again and again in the mind. I am not sure how to define the quality and character of their 'sound' There is a special harmony, an intelligence , an irony, perhaps too a wistfulness and sadness at times. There is a certain kind of beauty in regret and perhaps this too is part of their music- regret and longing.<br /><br />They are one of the lasting 'sounds' of that great musical era , the sixties.
B000KQGP2G|2.0|I've only been listening to Pain of Salvation for a few years, but apparently that was long enough for me to witness the ship sink. They definitely have had a good run with several good albums and yes, a couple great ones as well. But now, it seems with this album (as with the previous one) they are content with releasing material rife with prog-garbage and inane glorification of their own personal agendas, that only fanboys/girls in denial can appreciate.<br /><br />It seems that Scarsick is actually sequel to The Perfect Element, though I seem to be unclear as to whether this applies to the whole album, or just the second side, for it seems that only the second side continues on (if only somewhat) in TPE tradition. Addressing this latter portion of the album first, I'd say that it contains the majority--if not all--of the good moments Scarsick has to offer, and is really the only part that I find even remotely memorable. \\"Kingdom of Loss\\" and \\"Idiocracy\\" are definite album highlights, and the remaining songs in the second half do have musical and conceptual high points, despite being a bit bland and not very memorable in the end. I almost wish this portion of the album had been released as an EP, because it could be that it really is better than the impression I have received from it, due to the horrendous songs that precede it blinding/deafening my judgment. Returning to this first side of the album, the songs are just too distasteful and pannoying to be enjoyed on any level. (Pannoying = prog-annoying, a word I just created.) Don't get me wrong, I understand what they're trying to do, namely, a seemingly tounge-in-cheek lashing-out at certain aspects of modern life, etc., etc. But no, it just doesn't work. Not for this band, and not in this way. The overuse of spoken word/rapping/cussing, prevalent mostly in \\"Spitfall,\\" is really awful. \\"Cribcaged\\" is all right at first, until it turns into a weak and blatant rip-off of Tool's \\"Aenima.\\" (**** your own lack of originality, Gildenlow.) then the pitiful America-bashing song: probably one of the band's worst to date. Apparently Danny boy is still disgruntled over the fingerprint incident. \\"Disco Queen.\\" No. Just...no. There are no two ways about it: the song is terrible and wrong in every way. So overall it seems that Gildenlow, once a bold and imaginative lyricist, has reverted into a spiteful and juvenille creature, even more pretentious than before. I can deal with pretension, but there's a threshold of tolerance, and he has definitely surpassed it.<br /><br />In short, I feel this is a very weak album overall, infused with but a few strong points, and that--in conjunction with the incredibly terrible BE--it may be safe to assert that the days of consistently good song-writing are over for this once-exceptional band. A generous 4/10 for Scarsick, with the points mainly going toward the second half of the album.originality, Gildenlow.) then the pitiful America-bashing song: probably one of the band's worst to date.

0062502182|1.0|I tend to stay away from books that are pushed on the masses. I am not a snob. It is just that my reading sensibilities tend to run counter to the populace. On some ocassions my literary taste meshes with what the world seems to like. \\"The Alchemist\\" was not that book for me. The whole time I was reading it I had a feeling that I had read the story before. It wasn't until I got to the end did I realize that I had. It is one of many stories in 1001 Arabian Nights. That telling is short, sweet and much more powerful. Coelho drags the story out thereby losing much of the poignancy. Brevity is often the better choice when telling a story. Compare the two tellings of the story and you will agree. Word.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|FIRST REVIEW...5/3/07...edited a bit on 6/26/07<br />First of all...I was not expecting so much acoustic guitar from Alex.  This is very different, and different is not always bad.  Sometimes albums that I do not immediately like grow on me.  (Porcupine Tree's Deadwing is a perfect example...I didn't like it at first, but it is now one of my favorite albums.)<br /><br />With Snakes & Arrows, I have to say I didn't like album title when I first heard it.  I loved Far Cry after one listen, and I was excited to hear the rest of the album.  Let's just say after Far Cry my expectations were really high, so I felt a little bit of a let down after listening to the album.  I just seems really different.  I also have to admit I don't like the song names either...they seemed \\"dumbed down\\" compared to previous albums and song titles, which had a little more depth.<br /><br />What I do like is that Rush is changing up their formula completely.  In the past they were predictable...4 studio albums, live album (with maybe a subsequent video release like \\"A Show Of Hands\\"), and repeat!  The only change up was the greatest hits compilations.  Since Different Stages things have been exciting as a Rush fan...it was studio album (Vapor Trails - which I really liked despite bad mastering) and then live album Rush In Rio CD/DVD...then Feedback EP of cover songs...then R30 Anniversary Tour DVD with companion CD...then DVD reissue of classic concerts with added unreleased Grace Under Pressure CD/DVD.  I think this new unpredictable approach has rubbed off on their work in the studio.  If Rush had come out with countless copies/rehashes of 2112, A Farewell To Kings or Moving Pictures or other classic sounds, then I would get bored, complacent and maybe even stop being such a rabid fan.  However, their energy, creativity and passion continues to inspire me, and I keep coming back for more...<br /><br />ADDED INFO...6/26/07<br />There is a lot of information on this album that took me at least a dozen times to get into...Geddy plays a fretless bass and Neil plays a 4 piece kit on Malignant Narcissism.  The Main Monkey Business was recorded live in the studio with the guys playing together in one take.  The drums were recorded with mics versus triggered digital drums as in the past few albums.  Alex plays a lot of acoustic guitars that gives a different soundscape to the songs.  Geddy plays a mellotron which is the first time since 2112 and A Farewell To Kings era of Rush.  The producer really got Neil, Geddy and Alex out of their comfort zone and helped them create a great album.<br /><br />I just got the MVI version of this album today, and it is a great companion to this album.  It gives insight into the writing and recording of the album.  The documentary is the main sell for me to have footage of the guys talking about their work.  Not only has the album grown on me, but this MVI has given me a different view of the songs from the artist's perspective.ddy plays a fretless bass and Neil plays a 4 piece kit on Malignant Narcissism.

038533558X|4.0|Lots of twists and turns with an ending you really don't see coming.<br /><br />This is a rather convoluted tale...<br /><br />Will's brother Ken has been on the run for over eleven years now, he is wanted for the murder of Julie Miller, Will's ex-girlfriend. Will's current true love, Sheila, suddenly disappears from his life with no explanation. Will is trying to unravel all of the deception and figure out whether or not his brother is really innocent like Will has believed all these years. While at the same time trying to figure out just who was the woman he thought he loved.<br /><br />The story is complete with sorority sisters, a mob boss, an overzealous FBI agent, a quadriplegic pimp, a former skin-head and by my count at least two sociopaths.<br /><br />I liked these characters, the dialog was believable, the details realistic. It was a quick and enjoyable read with lots of clever twists and turns and an ending that really surprised me.
B000000OU4|5.0|Initially i thought there was something questionable about this album...maybe too smooth or something. Possibly the seamlessly smooth integration of Metheny's synth quitar with Lyle's great piano and the excellent vocal support..Blaimes et al.  Eventually i was hooked...great compositions, and once you recognize the synth for what it is,well only PMG could make something sound so very melodic. This is solid jazz.
B0000024IE|5.0|Fear of a Black Planet transcends what we know as rap and goes down as just a great piece of work in any genre. This is an album that combines all the elements: vision, cohesion, originality, scope, ambition, confidence, substance, and relevance. From the sound bites of the opening track right on down to the call to arms of \\"Fight the Power\\", this masterpiece is breathtakingly on the mark. These songs deal with a wide range of subjects such as hope (\\"Brothers Gonna Work It Out\\"), interracial dating (\\"Pollywannacraka\\"), the bigotry of showbiz (\\"Burn Hollywood Burn\\"), and everything in between to create an album of sheer power. Even the throwaways like \\"B-Side Wins Again\\" and \\"Reggie Jax\\" keep the listener interested. Fear of a Black Planet is just a massive onslaught of song-tumbling-into-song that grabs your ears and refuses to let go. Chuck D has always been a master of the 5-minute rap song and on here, he delivers maybe his best ever on \\"Welcome to the Terrordome\\", Chuck D spilling his guts about everything that pisses him off at a schizophrenic pace about the dangers of propaganda. It is truly a magnificent and moving piece of personal songwriting. All in all, Fear of a Black Planet is right up there with Blur's The Great Escape, Radiohead's OK Computer, and Massive Attack's Mezzanine for best album of the 90's.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Talk about singing with style and substance, leave it to Michael Buble to deliver it with smooth interpretations of old standards and new ones! I bought the Special Package Edition that contains \\"Love\\", but why did I have to pay an extra $12.00 for it?!
B000006045|5.0|Massive Attack's Mezzanine ranks right up there with David Bowie's Low, Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica,  and the Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat for most original album in the history of pop music. It is an album of craft; each beat, each note, and each lyric are carefully put into place for perfection. This album is not for everybody however; the dense, pristine production of Mezzanine conjures up a heavy air of claustrophobia. If slow and creepy is your cup of tea, then take a gulp, because this is as good as it gets. Mezzanine is a concept album. Since it is hard to figure out what the concept is, I will give it away. It is about autism. Mezzanine is not a happy record, but it is not depressing either. The tone that I get is one of fuzzy, distorted confusion, with the singers detailing the struggles of making sense of the world around them (the way autistic savants do) with impeccable songwriting. Lyrics such as \\"toy-like people/make me boy-like\\" will remain fresh and experimental for a very long time. Mezzanine is more hypnotic than entertaining, that is for sure. But in that, it succeeds impossibly well. Mezzanine, along with Blur's The Great Escape, is the best album of the 90's. Genius.
0060567503|4.0|Cute allegory, but too long for the advice the author is trying to present. I purchased the CD so I can utilize my travel time, but purchasing the book may have been a better option so I could skim through the text, find the useful advice, and skip the unnecessary filler. While trying to learn how to become a more effective manager I don't need cute allegory.  Overall, I would recommend it to new and upcoming managers and supervisors.
B00005JPO8|5.0|<br />A moving story of change and redemption. The character of the protagonist improves even while his own meager personal circumstances decline. In fact his improving character causes the decline and saves the life and sanity of a deserving playwrite. I can't remember the last time I saw such self-sacrifice in a film?
0066620996|5.0|What makes this book very different is, it is based on facts captured through five years of extensive research by a group of dedicated people. It is inspiring yet not pure theory. Although the emphasis of the book is how to be the best in the world; I read it with an eye on \\"how to be among the top in your market segment or as a matter of fact in your daily life\\". If not all, many of the points apply to Big companies. For example, hiring the best and getting rid of mediocre people. Small companies and Sole Propritership does not have this luxury.  Therefore you need to use a bit of imagination and relax some rules to be \\"among the top\\" which may take you to the top.  Trying to apply some very strict rules without many resources at your hand could be a disaster.  Overall, this is among the best business books I have read.
B000ION79Y|1.0|I was watching this movie and became so baffled by how horrible it was that I did a little internet research. Apparently they filmed the vast majority of the movie and then changed the plot. It was supposed to be a movie about aliens and about the Russian Mafia and about a military conspiracy, etc. Then after filming they tried to concoct a new stroy through editing. <br /> <br />One of the most disconcerting aspect of the movie is that they dubbed over Segal's voice for about 1/3 of the movie. The voice they used is not even remotely close to Segal's voice. So I was totally confused. Why was he talking like that? Was it him talking? Who was talking? Gaaah! Absolutely maddening. <br /> <br />I'm not going to take the time to give a thorough review. I know that others have already done that. I just came on here to make sure I added my \\"1 star\\" rating in the hopes of saving some poor soul from watching this film. <br /> <br />I just want to add one last thing. Several others have said it and you might think they speak in jest. But I'm telling you seriously, that movie was actually painful to watch.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I purchased this Britney CD recently because I'd somehow lost my Britney collection over the years due to loaning them out and household moves.  I really like this CD, especially the song \\"Everytime.\\"  I can't wait for Britney's 5th album to come out later this year.
032147404X|5.0|I enjoyed this book and learned a lot.  It is simple enough for anyone to understand and still gives useful info to even the pros.  I teach digital photography at our local college.  I found the book useful, and so do my beginning students.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I might have to purchase another one of these, because I keep listening to it.  I love Norah's voice.
0060536357|5.0|This book provides a dramatic and well told lesson about the dangers of greed and how it infected the business world in the late 80's. As every big player in the financial world jumped at the chance to try to take over one of America's largest and most respected companies, RJR Nabisco, it seemed that everyone lost sight of the target and simply wanted to be part of the transaction even if that meant ignoring their morals and playing fast and loose with the financials of the deal. This book is very well written--it reads like a novel and is simple enough to be understood by someone with no LBO experiences--and insightful. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in business or the historic aspects of the \\"greed is good\\" era.
0823023494|5.0|This book is a terrific view of the craft of character design from someone doing it for a living.  It's a great insight to the process, and really assists with sparking creativity. <br /> <br />It also shows various takes on the characters used as examples from working artists in various disciplines, and seeing the differences in how the characters are portrayed by each demonstrates the wide-open interpretation of a character's description and the limitless possibilities for variation. <br /> <br />The exercises are well-designed and really assist with reinforcement of the concepts, and the artwork is really fun too.  A great book overall.  Highly recommended, not just for character design, but for insights into interpreting your own creative processes and exploring it more fully.
B00005JP1A|5.0|In a small town called Haven in Louisiana there are series of bizzare events that seem to point toward there being a biblical plaque on the loose, like rivers of human blood, livestock dying mysteriously, boils and locusts erupting and swarming through the town.<br /><br />A former Christian missionary Katherine who no longer believes in God or miracles played by the versatile Hilary Swank along with her intelligent assistant portrayed by the yummy Idris Elba are persuaded by one of the town's residents, the hunky Doug, David Morrissey at his smoldering best, to come along and investigate the strange goings on in his home town.<br /><br />He persuades Katherine to come by telling her that the town is blaming a little girl, a child who is not much older than Katherine's murdered daughter.  It's a ploy that works and she and her assistant accompany Doug to Haven.<br /><br />What happens next is both thrilling and nerve racking.  There are enough heart stopping moments in this movie that will make your pacemaker go into overdrive, I certainly jumped on more than one occasion!<br /><br />Great special effects, solid acting, Stephen Rea only has small part as the  tormented priest who tries to warn Katherine that she is great danger, but he does it with great aplomb and conviction.<br /><br />Anna Sophia Robb is Lauren, a girl who you are not sure is good or bad only that she seems to be around a lot when terrible things happen and that she is the key in all that is going on it what should be a lovely little bible belt town hidden from the outside world.<br /><br />There are two good twists in the tale in this movie, I won't spoil them by telling you what they are but they are good.<br /><br />This is a great film and Swank steals the show though everyone else is excellent in it.<br /><br />A bit slow moving at first but it gathers momentum and culminates in the ride of your life as as you try to work out who is good, who is bad and what the hell is going on in the supposed God fearing town of Haven?
B000NVIXFK|5.0|All I can say is WOW.  Being a long-time fan, I can blab on and on about how it doesn't sound like Moving Pictures, Permanent Waves, etc.  That's fine with me because this album shows that they still have the skills to make a very emotional album and present it with the best musicianship i've heard from them in a very long time. If every album sounded just like the late 70's-early 80's Rush, i'd get quite bored. <br /> <br />Perhaps the best aspect of this album is it's production.  Second to none!  Very easily in the top 3 of my best sounding CD's in my collection including some SACD's.  Coming after Vapor Trails, they didn't have any choice but to make a better recorded album (VT was an embarassment in that regard) <br /> <br />Highlights: <br /> <br />The instrumentals - Monkey Business is exquisite, Make Mal Nar 6 minutes long and i'd have to give the album 7 stars. <br /> <br />We Hold On <br /> <br />The Way the Wind Blows <br /> <br />Take this CD and turn it up to excessively loud levels and it still sounds good. <br /> <br />See you at the concert!!!  He** yeah!!
B000002J27|5.0|A Trick of the Tail is one of my favorite Genesis albums, despite leading the band on its first baby steps toward bombast and mediocrity after (due to?) the departure of Peter Gabriel.  But the musical ideas at this point in the group's history are still rich and under glorious exploration.  Songs have very different and stunning textures, led by Phil Collins' strong percussion, with often great composition by Rutherford and Banks and strong collaboration all around.  Trick of the Tail is near the peak of Genesis' musicial brilliance.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|as to why this is absolutely my favorite band. Since 1984, I have been in an ever growing state of awe as to how three men can make such wonderful and amazing music. Their most recent effort does not disappointment, but rather validates why I have been an admirer for the last 23 years. An applause is in order my dear friends. Thank you for producing such wonderful and inspiring music for the last 34 years. You are a group without peer, and it is my hope that your legion of adoring fans plant the seed for a future generation to appreciate the true majesty of creativity and musicianship. Geddy,Alex & Neil, I salute you...
0345494768|5.0|A friend of mine emphatically recommended that I order this book, and I did based on his word alone. When I got it, I was ready to be stunned, but I wasn't prepared to be absolutely blown away. Just flipping through, I only made it to page 65 before being completely overwhelmed with the depth of and quality of information... and I was just scratching the surface, with almost 300 more pages to go! I've got a lot of books on the making and the art of Star Wars, and there are literally hundreds of photos in this book that I've never seen before. And they're good photos too! I can't wait to have time to sit down and read this book cover to cover- a whole film class on Star Wars, in a single book! <br /> <br />You'd be hard pressed to find any book or documentary that goes as in depth into the making of a film (or any other single piece of art, for that matter) as The Making of Star Wars by J.W. Rinzler. <br /> <br />The pages are printed on non-glare paper too, so there's no trouble reading the small text in direct light - a problem that far too many \\"coffee table\\" books suffer from (although the photos in this book have an elegant glossy sheen to them). <br /> <br />Highest possible recommendation for any Film fan, and a must have for any Star Wars aficionado.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|You know the one. The guy who defends a movie by saying its detractors \\"don't get it\\" or \\"missed the point\\". The guy who implies the so-called problem is not the confusing plot, awkward direction, poor acting, etc, but rather the viewer's intelligence. I'm going to try to avoid being \\"that guy\\" in this review, so here goes... <br /> <br />There is little point in reviewing this film's plot. Amazon.com and tons of reviewers have done just that. This is simply to function as an elaboration of just why \\"Brick\\" is how it is. <br /> <br />\\"Brick\\" is very much a genre piece. Not only that, it is part of a genre that is no longer particularly popular. Film noirs, in their purest sense, haven't been popular (or regularly made) in decades. \\"Brick\\", despite its present-day high school setting and teenage characters, is a film noir.  <br /> <br />If you haven't seen many film noirs and thus are less comfortable with (or willing to put up with) their conventions, \\"Brick\\" may not work for you at all. The plot is convoluted, the dialogue is strange and stilted, the characters live in a sparsely-populated, seemingly self-contained world. In most genres these traits would be tsk-worthy. With noirs, which tend to focus more on atmosphere and relish ambiguity, they are accepted and often championed.  <br /> <br />\\"Brick\\" is not going to be for everyone--what film is? If you go into this film expecting something modern or realistic, you will likely be disappointed. If you have a open mind, or at least realize what you're getting in to, you will discover a creative spin on a stagnant genre, some excellent performances (particularly Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and one of the best films in recent years.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I have been a Stevie fan since middle school, and so it doesn't take much for me to get excited. \\"Crystal Visions\\" may technically be a greatest hits package, but yet it so much more than that as well. I love it because there are versions of my favorite songs that I had never heard before, especially the live versions of \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" and \\"Landslide\\" performed with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />Then there is the DVD, which makes me even happier because although I have seen some of these videos before on VH-1, there are quite a few I had never seen, including the rare \\"Scarlett version\\" of \\"Stand Back.\\" I also love the optional commentary by Stevie, which lets true fans like me absorb all there is to know about these videos.<br /><br />\\"Crystal Visions\\" ROCKS!
B00005JPPI|5.0|Wow. I had high expectations for this film, and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />The acting and the characterization is fantastic. Every character has emotional depth, and at one point or another through the film you both love and hate something about each one of them. The good guys aren't totally good, and the bad guys aren't totally bad, and I find that to be all to rare these days. <br /> <br />Storywise, despite what some have said, there are no continuity flaws. In the opening scene of the movie, Anthony Hopkins's character is seen making a call from a payphone to verify when the particular detective is on-duty, and he makes sure that officer is the one who he invites inside his house after the shooting occurs. I don't see anything implausible about that. <br /> <br />This legal thriller can't help but remind me of my favorite legal thriller, The Firm. While Fracture is not AS intense, as life-or-death, as edge-of-your-seat as The Firm, I still found it highly enjoyable with no complaints. And it is indeed rare for me to go to a movie these days without at least a few complaints. <br /> <br />Hopkins plays this character brilliantly, and despite what others may say, I do not feel that it is just a rip off of Hannibal Lecter. There are more differences than there are similarities, although both can certainly be creepy characters. <br /> <br />Overall this is truly a good movie, focusing on the moral dilemma between right and wrong, and in discovering whether one's own morals are on the right side in the process. <br /> <br />Very rarely do I purchase movies on DVD, or even watch any movie a second time, but this one is on my to-buy list. That is the highest praise I can give it. :-) <br />
B00003CX9E|5.0|When you watch this film, try and ignore the comment that it's the \\"greatest movie ever made\\".  When a film is tagged with that line, people are bound to be disappointed.  Just go into it thinking \\"this is going to be a great film\\".  Citizen Kane is an amazing work, one of the best films ever made.  Is it the greatest?  I don't know.  Personally, my favorite Welles film is The Trial, but I do love Kane.  Orson was only 25 when he made it, and even today its script, performances, and technical innovations are still fresh and interesting.  The deep focus photography (courteous of the great Gregg Toland) is stunning to behold today.  It's an incredibly cinematic experience, and a searing indictment of yellow journalism which is practiced way too often today.  The film has been parodied quite a bit (most notably on The Simpsons, who parody just about everything), and its reputation as the greatest film ever made hurts it a bit, and it is unfortunate that both of these things have a detrimental effect.  I don't think any film can really claim the title of greatest ever made, but this one does belong in the top ten.
0738711500|3.0|\\"When the time comes and you have someone sitting in front of you for a reading, the bottom line is this--they don't care how much technical knowledge you may have. They don't want to be blinded by science or your amazing knowledge (however great it may be). What they want is an accurate reading...end of story.\\" - From the Easy Tarot Handbook<br /><br />Using the popular [[ASIN:0738705209 Gilded Tarot]] by Ciro Marchetti, U.K. resident Josephine Ellershaw teaches Tarot newcomers how to learn the cards step-by-step using her own method she calls The Tarot Technique. Stressing the importance of maintaining a Tarot diary and getting to know the cards one at a time, Ms. Ellershaw leads readers by the hand in the Easy Tarot Kit, encouraging patience and focus along the journey.<br /><br />Divided into twenty-two steps, the 223-page Easy Tarot Handbook bypasses the oft-customary history lesson, as well as complicated esoteric systems, in favor of simply--and thoroughly--explaining how to prepare, care and connect with the cards. Explaining, \\"one card does not a reading make\\", Ms. Ellershaw reminds readers that the art of Tarot reading relies on associations among cards, where surrounding cards influence and inform the best interpretation for a card.<br /><br />For example, Ms. Ellershaw relates a story where an inconsiderate reader told a woman that she'd be getting a divorce--based solely on the 3 of Swords absent of any supporting cards (i.e. the surrounding cards showed a happy marriage and home life). Confused and distraught, this woman turned to Ms. Ellershaw for guidance. Turns out that the original reader didn't bother to take the time to find out the woman's situation--for if she had, she would have soon realized that the husband was working away from home...and the couple missed each other terribly.<br /><br />The Easy Tarot Handbook introduces each card from the Gilded Tarot one by one, beginning with the Minor Arcana, then the Court Cards and the Majors last. This refreshing departure from the norm (where the Majors are presented first and the Courts are lumped with the number cards) is sensible and accessible. Ms. Ellershaw emphasizes the importance of NOT reading for others \\"for practice\\" when first learning the Tarot, instead encouraging reading for yourself first.<br /><br />Ms. Ellershaw addresses reading \\"awkward\\" cards that don't seem to fit, as well as those that seem to induce a \\"blank\\"--prodding readers to look inward for the reasons some cards seem troubling. The Easy Tarot Handbook also covers ethics, health readings (she advises against them), charging (or bartering) for readings, reading for minors, why the cards remain may remain silent on pivotal issues (such as accidents) and more. The Easy Tarot Handbook also provides \\"cheat sheets\\" for the Majors and Minors (but not Court Cards).<br /><br />I enjoyed Ms. Ellershaw's treatment of the Courts (she points out that character and personality traits are more reliable than astrological Sun Sign associations or hair/eye/complexion data), as well as her systematic--but personable--approach to learning the cards. I also think it's great that she emphasizes the power of thoughts and beliefs, and how hope can be found in every reading--no matter how dire the cards may look.<br /><br />However, I feel that the spreads Ms. Ellershaw teaches and recommends--such as The Celtic Cross and a twenty-eight card Life Spread, may be too complicated for beginners. She also describes a complex method for reading timing in the Celtic Cross, and asserts that smaller spreads (such as 3-card spreads) are actually more difficult to learn than larger spreads. Granted, she does provide lucid explanations and sample readings, but I would think much of this might be overwhelming to new readers. (When I first learned the Tarot, I tried reading with The Celtic Cross and found it complex, vague and discouraging.)<br /><br />Because the Easy Tarot kit is designed specifically for use with the Gilded Tarot, Marchetti's deck must be one that appeals to you aesthetically and resonates with you intuitively--so keep this in mind if you want to learn the Tarot with one particular deck. While gorgeous, the Gilded Tarot doesn't speak to me on any level (see my separate review of this deck).<br /><br />Surprisingly, some of the card interpretations are superficial and brief. For each card, there is a description based on the Gilded Tarot image and then an interpretation. For example, here's the interpretation for The Sun:<br /><br />\\"The Sun is one of the most positive cards in the Tarot, for it brings happiness, success, and triumphs, excellent relationships, a happy marriage, contentment, prosperity, and good health. The Sun tends to shine favorable upon any situation. When this card is present, it is important to make the most of its favorable aspects.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Ellershaw doesn't cover reversed cards or the light/shadow of each card dynamic.<br /><br />Another addition to the Easy Tarot kit: a large, glossy foldout designed for laying out the Celtic Cross spread plus Ms. Ellershaw's 4-card \\"Readers Fan\\" (that she never quite gets around to explaining sufficiently.) Each rectangle is the size of the Gilded Tarot cards (approximately 4 ¾ x 2 ¾ inches) with all positions labeled (e.g. Card Position 8 Environmental Factors: How Others See You).<br /><br />Engaging and down-to-Earth, the Easy Tarot Handbook by Josephine Ellershaw is a refreshing introduction to the Tarot. If you love the looks of the Gilded Tarot, and feel that you'd be able to connect to the images on an intuitive level, then you may very well want to try the Easy Tarot kit for learning the cards. If you enjoy getting to know the cards via a Tarot diary as Ms. Ellershaw recommends, I think [[ASIN:0738707848 Mary K. Greer's 21 Ways to Read a Tarot Card]] would be an excellent addition to this kit. If you'd like a book on creating your own spreads using a central method, Joan Bunning's [[ASIN:1578632706 Learning Tarot Spreads]] would be a great adjunct to this kit, as well.<br /><br />(To see 10 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at JanetBoyer.com)<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)e Gilded Tarot, Marchetti's deck must be one that appeals to you aesthetically and resonates with you intuitively--so keep this in mind if you want to learn the Tarot with one particular deck.

Greer's 21 Ways to Read a Tarot Card]] would be an excellent addition to this kit. If you'd like a book on creating your own spreads using a central method, Joan Bunning's [[ASIN:1578632706 Learning Tarot Spreads]] would be a great adjunct to this kit, as well.<br /><br />(To see 10 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at JanetBoyer.com)<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)
B00097A5I6|4.0|As I listen to much of Oasis's work, I can't help but to think of the song \\"Where Did it All Go Wrong\\", from the mostly forgettable SOTSOG album.  I think of this song not so much because of the underlying work itself, but rather I believe this phrase to be a very apt question in evaluating the relevence of Oasis's music since \\"What's the Story Morning Glory\\". I don't know what happened, whether the Gallagher hubris overshadowed their music or the industry just moved on, but Oasis keeps coming out with relevant music that, is for the large part, under-marketed and virtually ignored by the public. In my estimation, this album is no different.  \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is, much like \\"Be Here Now\\" before it, an unheralded album which richly deserves some quality time in your CD player.   <br /> <br />With \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\", Oasis has released their strongest album in several years. Having said that, this album was forgotten about just as quickly as it was released.  For those of you who haven't heard it, you are really missing out on some quality work from the Gallagher brothers.  <br /> <br />Sure, this album has some filler (see \\"A Bell Will Ring\\" and \\"Keep the Dream Alive\\"--in the interest of brevity, don't waste your time). What would an Oasis album be without some Gallagher mindless self indulgence though. That aside, songs like \\"Love Like a Bomb\\", \\"Part of the Queue\\", \\"I Guess God Thinks I'm Able\\", and \\"Lyla\\" make this album worth your while.  <br /> <br />If you are still waffling on a purchase of this album, I will let you in on another secret gem. Every album seems to have one Noel track that shines above most of the other offerings (see \\"Little By Little\\", \\"Where Did it All Go Wrong\\", and \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" for statement justification). \\"Truth\\" is no exception to this precedent. With the track \\"Mucky Fingers\\", Noel has again provided us with a toe-tapping song that not only steals the show, but will be stuck in your head for days to come.  <br /> <br />In closing, I would recommend this album to anyone who was a pre-1997 Oasis fan who questions their ability to continue in today's music scene. You won't be disappointed.
0751532711|5.0|While I don't Agree with everything that Kiyosaki teaches, this book does an excellent job of emphasizing the importance of financial education and the importance of owning your own business. The rich dad series should not be the only book on wealth that you read, but it is an excellent book to read for those that typically have trouble sticking with this genre of books. It is a very quick and easy read and does a great job of holding the reader's attention throughout.
B000NVIXDW|2.0|I love Michael Buble's singing.  But I have to say, something is up with his voice.  Am I the only one out there who hears him lisping his way through this album?  It is like he is singing with someone holding onto the tip of his tongue.  Or maybe he got his tongue pierced.  I don't know, but all the lisping is distracting from what would otherwise be a fabulous project.  It ruined it for me.
1892005034|4.0|The book is somewhat corny, the examples border on ridiculous at times.   <br />But, I was trying it out with my husband.  It was like a miracle.  The minute I would use the techniques we would stop fighting, we began to express our affection for each other and were able to talk about things we'd never talked about before.  The minute I would stop using it, we would start fighting again.  I have taken conversations that were headed for the dumps, starting using these techniques and ended up with a very useful bonding experience.  My husband won't try it though because when he read the book, he thought it sounded so stupid.  But, he is sort of picking up the techniques I think from copying me.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|Hi, <br />This is one of the best films of the 80's. Seen it on a date, As a guy I thought going in another chick flick, but its more then that. Myself I come from a similar working class background as Johnnys character and always enjoyed some of the classic dancing done in the film, but in the 80's and a guy you were considered gay for wanting to dance like this, but the movie changed this for all guys who dug ditchs in the day and wanted to dance at night, it was okay to dance. Hell the women of the time wanted you to dance like this after this movie came out.  <br />The DVD itself is the best transfer I have seen every and the sound is excellent, throw your other disks and vhs tape in the garbage this is it. And finally a Patrick Swazyie interview to boot. The reason I got it early was due to my winning a contest for the pre-release DVD and one night showing of the movie. To say that my wife was thrilled to bits would be an understatement. (Not the same girl on date, new and improved)This is definately a sleep-over movie for girls of all ages, the theatre showing enforced this concept. And Guys take your Girl to this movie or buy it for her on DVD, they will be smiling at you for days to follow. <br />(You sensitive Man you).
0765348276|1.0|I bought this book because of the glowing readers' reviews in Amazon. I do not understand this reaction. Opening the book, I met a central character whose lame attempts at humor are acclaimed as hilarious. Gradually we find our man is gifted at everything but amazingly modest. This endears him to his fictional friends who are numerous and described in tedious detail. The tiny amount of SF is antiquated -- the \\"elevator to orbit\\" has been with us many years if not decades. Even so, we are supposed to marvel at this and the few other dusty \\"marvels\\" introduced. A physicist character in inserted to relieve the author from any explanation by insisting that our math is inadequate. Aliens are thrown at us in pathetic haste, as mere cartoon monsters. I wonder this book can be classed as SF. Yet so many other readers have written glowing reviews that the book must have some special merit I fail to grasp. I can only warn those fond of real SF to be wary.
B000O1799U|5.0|I was a little girl when Dreamgirls debuted on Broadway and, alas I never saw it. My mother, however, went off to see a matinee in New York and came back with stories of a 12 minute standing ovation for another Jennifer H. So let's get this out of the way. In the hearts of the nostalgic, yes, Jennifer Holiday's award winning performance is still spectacular and shall forever be enshrined in Broadway and entertainment history.  <br /> <br />But that hardly takes away from the performance of Ms. Jennifer Hudson in this film. Let's put it this way. Remember Oprah in THE COLOR PURPLE? You think you've seen the only definition of Sofia forever. Until you see Felicia Fields on Broadway playing her over twenty years later. The role is redefined, and for the better.  <br /> <br />Jennifer Hudson is like a supernova every time she steps onto the screen. Blazing hot and all-consuming. Even when she whispers, she commands your attention. She's Effie the way Leontyne Price and Heather Headley were Aida, the way Streisand was Fanny Bryce, the way Ethel Merman was Mama Rose and the way Ebersole is now Little Edie Beale. Some people command a role for a generation. The role of Effie now belongs to two legends.  <br /> <br />Beyonce's performance was better than I expected, but I can't help but wonder if she's acting or reliving her own experiences with her former girl group. There was one moment, however, when in one pained look she quietly exhibited more acting than she seems to have done in years of movie roles. Bravo to the director who coaxed that hidden talent out of her. Here's hoping she shows more of it.  <br /> <br />Jamie Foxx was pleasantly surprising as a bad guy. Eddie Murphy was the same as the (pardon the pun) unsung R&B hero, but I think his performance suffered because we'd seen him do it before. By the time he's rapping \\"Jimmy's got soul\\" over heavy horns, all I can think about is his old skit \\"The James Brown Celebrity Hot Tub Party\\". I know other reviewers havesaid that, and I tried not to believe it. But it's pretty accurate. Not to mention the shades of THE FIVE HEARTBEATS movie. And yeah, I know Dreamgirls came out first.  <br /> <br />The real quiet revelation in the movie is someone few reviewers talked about. Mr. Danny Glover. I thought his dignified, ethical, put-upon manager was a great thread through the entire film. I am really surprised that he didn't receive more attention for this part. Well done Mr. Glover.  <br /> <br />More than anything else for me, what a joy to not only see the musical returning as a viable genre to the movies these days, but to see wonderful performances by new and seasoned actors. This is well worth the purchase, the rental, etc.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005V331|5.0|If you're going to criticize Venom by saying that they lack musical finesse, you might as well criticize Ramones for the same reason.  Go ahead - - Venom gladly welcomes such pinheads to the place they should darned well know they can go.  And I bet they like Ramones, too.
0151013047|4.0|Hamid's novel is the story of a liberal minded young man; who quests for his purpose with the alteration of events. Changez is a young Pakistani who graduates from Princeton University and gets a job working as an analyst at a prestigious valuation firm named Underwood Samson. <br /> <br />I found the novel had some interesting references; as a colleague tells Changez in jest \\"Beware the Dark Side, young Skywalker,\\" a reference to an idealist fighting an evil empire will resonate with Changez's own integration into America. At a later point in Chile he finds entrapment in the allegory of janissaries, \\"the Christian boys who were captured and trained to be soldiers in a Muslim army, at that time the greatest army in the world...they had fought to erase their own civilizations, so they had nothing else to turn to\\". The analogy asks him to question his role in the development of the empire; which has caused devastation through wars in the region he felt imbued with. His lapse of understanding his associates in the shock of the loss of the twin towers; while regarding the loss in Afghanistan as casualties of war. <br /> <br />Even though compelling; I felt the novel missed its mark. It is not absolutely clear; why he lost his focus; was it the disillusionment with the America or the loss of Erica.  <br />
6305841861|5.0|The series takes a left turn towards comedy in this sequel to a straight out horror film, not to say there is no horror to be found. There are plenty of scenes that will make you jump if you don't know what is coming, but there is a lot of laughs as well. In one word, the movie is fun. Bruce Campbell carries the film since it really does focus on his character and changes Ash from a quiet person into this explosive action hero that you can't help but cheer on! Every time I think of my favorite scenes, the majority of them involve Ash, which is what makes him such a great character. The big scene I immediately think of is when he fights his own hand, you'll just have to watch to see that for yourself.<br /><br />A bigger budget was used in the making of this movie, but some B qualities still can be seen in the movie. Such as you can see there is no roof to the cabin when Ash is trying to out run the deadite spirit following him into the house. Another instance being when the eye pops out of the deadite, you can see the little black piece of plastic making the eye fly. Small things like that do not effect this movie, the story is compelling and you will ignore anything that seems cheesy. There is too much good about the movie and will always win over anything bad that can be said about this movie.<br /><br />People kept asking after watching the first movie, why wasn't Ash every possessed in the first film when all of his friends were? Well, he gets to be possessed in this film in more than one occasion, so it goes to show that even he isn't immune. Overall, this is another MUST SEE! I have watched the movie many times and this is definitely something that will never get old.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|This recording is a return by RUSH to playing some really vital and moving music. The lyrics are blunt and striking and really drive their point home. At once, they offend and yet point out that our world hasn't really turned out the way we, all, would like it to be. This central theme runs through the entire album and creates great continuity between the songs. This is the seminal RUSH recording. It's everything that Counterparts through Vapor Trails was not. The music is both complex and yet very melodic. The songs create a certain mood with the fantastic combination of lyrics and masterful musicianship. <br /> <br />In short, it is indeed another RUSH masterpiece!!  Certainly their best work in over 10 years!! <br /> <br />However, if you're looking for 70s - 80s era RUSH, this isn't it.  It's totally different yet somehow still RUSH!!
B00005JNS0|5.0|Pixar has delivered a winner worthy of the checkered flag in 'CARS'.  This film marks the return of Pixar to what they do best:  a story about a character who learns what is really important in life (ie Toy Story 1 & 2, Monsters Inc. & Finding Nemo).   <br /> <br />Coupled with the jaw-dropping, eye-popping, high quality CGI we've come to expect from the studio, Pixar adds a great soundtrack guarranteed to have the audience on their feet cheering Lightning on to victory. <br /> <br />'CARS' truly has something for everyone:  the kids will love the fast paced race scenes and 'Mater's jokes;  NASCAR fans will appreciate the voices and the attention to the details of racing in the film.  The homage to lost Americana and 'the Mother Road', Route 66 is just icing on the cake, it makes a great thing even better. <br /> <br />'CARS' is a worthy addition to the home DVD collection and I recommend it without reservation.  Enjoy!!
0783225547|5.0|This is the most absorbing film I've ever seen! You have a whole town trying to evacuate and all of them are thinking about Number 1. This is also one of Brosnan's best films - and you don't think about Bond when you're watching it. Tremendous.
B00005R24K|5.0|It may not look like much by today's standards, but for the budget that was used making this movie, it really comes off great. This film is different from the two sequels in a couple of ways, one being that Ash is more of the cowardly co-star and second being that this is strictly horror. Not that it is really scary, but it's intention are in that genre with no real laughs intended. Everytime I watch the movie, I am amazed with how much was able to get done with such a low amount of money to spend and how well the movie comes off. It is just as good as any major film of the same year, you can't really tell the difference between a big budget horror movie and the Evil Dead when it comes to quality.<br /><br />It is easy to tell that there was talent that was working in front of and behind the camera. Not just Bruce (who would be the only star with any future success in film), but everyone else was equally impressive. The way the entire movie was written, set up and shot is nothing short of amazing for a young director and writer (Sam Raimi). Overall, if you have seen any of the other movies in the series or never have, this movie is a big recommendation. Just know that this is different from the other movies, as I said, Ash isn't the heroic icon he is known for now with the quick one liners. He is more of a side kick who accidentally has to survive his friends turning evil.
B000068TPN|4.0|THIS  IS  THE  MOST  REALISTIC  WAR  MOVIE  IVE  EVER  SEEN.  SAVING  PRIVATE  RYAN  WAS  GOOD  BUT  THIS  WAS  REALISTIC.  MY  STEPDAD  WAS  IN  VEITNAM  WAR.  THIS  MOVIE  SHOWS  WHAT  ITS  LIKE  TO  BE  THE  FAMILY  OF  A  MILATARY  PERSON.  IT  ALSO  PROVES  THAT  FIGHTING  FOR  YOUR  COUNTRY  IS  NOT  ALWAYS  A  BAD  THING.  YOU  SHOULD  SEE  THIS  MOVIE.
B000NQR7KM|5.0|I`m usually skeptical about remastered editions of albums. Usually, it`s an artist/record company ploy that entices the consumer to spend money on an album he/she already has.And usually, the sound of the remastered cd isn`t any more spectacular then when you had it originally,  A Trick of the Tail is a noted exception. I loved this album immediately when I heard it on cassette fifteen years ago,and it wasn`t because of the remastered sound that I purchased this cd. But I must tell you that the remastered sound is a vast improvemt over the previous cd reissue of this album. The  original production by David Hentschel is excellent and the clarity was a vast improvemnt over the Gabriel  Genesis albums . `You could hear the drums', as the Genesis biogrpaher, Amando Gallo pointed out at the time.  The selling point for me was not the reamstered sound , although I must say Im impressed wit the remastering job done here. I did not think they could produce any more clarity out of this album than what was already bourne out. When you hear Phil Colins sing on this album, it sounds as if he`s standing right next to you. And there are instrumental details of the songs I never picked out before. Mike Riuhterford`s bass guitar is more upfront than it ever has been.  Im sure for those of you who are reading this have heard a Trick of The Tail before and you know that the album is an example of great songwriting. I wouldn`t call it an overly progressive effort such as Selling Engalnd By the pound, but the album is a great collection of songs that stood the test of time, well before Phil Collins became a purveyor of lite Fm and Disney soundtrack music. His singing  is compelling and convincing, especially on tracks such as Mad man Moon and Ripples where he`s believable and vulnerable.And as I said before, the drum sound is vastly improved and hearing Collins play reminds you that this man was an underrated player,   Much of the credit of this album belongs to Tony Banks, who is vastly underrated as keyboard player and this was a man who was not given to onstage histrionics such as Emerson and Wakeman. His forte was good, concentrated songwriting. It`s no surprise that most of the writing crdits on this album belong to him.  The major selling point of the album for me happened to be the extras. You get the three promo videos for the album; Robbery, assault and battery, Ripples(the best track on the album ,IMO. The interplay between Hackett and Banks during the instrumental section is stirringly beatuiful), and A Trick of The tail. I knew you could get these videos on the Genesis video collection, but since much of it is culled form the 80`s and 90`S, I didn`t purchase that dvd since Im  not a huge fan of Genesis during that era.   In addition, you get the `Genseis Live in concert `76 film, which is a good document of the band before Steve Hackett departed the follwing year. You also have the prog vetaran drummer Bill bruford augmenting Collins. Unfortuantley, the film is marred by the director inserting silly silent movie and world war 2 footage during some of the songs. But when the director focuses on the band playing, it`s really exciting. The interplay between Collins and Bruford is astonishing. Banks keyboard work is impeccable , Rutherford holds his own on bass,and Collins is a pro behind the microphone and drums.    I must reitierate ; Its not often I`m a sucker for remastered albums, but I caved in on this one. Although knowing the quality of the songs defintely helped. Let`s put it this way; You wont see me forking over bucks for Abacab. I do have my standards.  Now, if only they remaster the Lamb, perhaps I can be lured into buying that one.
6304884419|4.0|It's a little slow, a bit methodical, and quite purposeful in its story-telling, and I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT...  This is Robert DeNiro's directorial debut, and its a winner! I credit a strong assist to Chazz Palminteris touching screenplay.<br /><br />For me, the charm of this movie was watching DeNiro play AGAINST type as a regular-guy, a working-class dad trying to protect his son from the lure of local mob-boss Chazz Palminteri. And, so soon after seeing him in Goodfellas as mob hitman Jimmy Conway.<br /><br />The winning formula here is making Palminteris Sonny LoSpecchio easy to root for. He doesn't encourage DeNiro's son (Lillo Brancato-- now grown up with his own real-life problems) to follow his lead; he really tries to steer him clear of the life he leads, but does teach him some heart-warming lessons along the way. DeNiro's Lorenzo fears he is losing his son, but the more he fights for him, the more he risks pushing him away... I file this under A slow burn.
0743455967|5.0|This is a remarkable book! It is one of the best I've ever read on writing. I have always been burdened by plot development, believing I needed to \\"plot\\" the entire story before I started to write. I felt liberated when I read Mr. King's \\"What if?\\" approach to storytelling.  By using this approach, the story evolves on its own.  Thanks for writing a great book.
B00005JMYI|4.0|I have 4 words for you: LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY (*lolf)!!!<br /><br />Will Ferrell is just brutally hilarious as 70s Anchorman Ron Burgundy, clashing with Christina Applegates Veronica Corningstone who wants to break the glass ceiling and join a previously, men-only club.<br /><br />I am not sure if its the bad 70s hair, the cheesy 70s mustache, the god-awful 70s polyester outfits, or the now classic Ferrell-lunacy that pace this LOLF comedy... but it is a can't miss.<br /><br />David Koechner, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell & Fred Willard ALL ADD to the stations madness with equal aplomb. Smaller bit parts, but BIG laughs go to some great cameos by: Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn & Luke Wilson.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Rush manages to make complicated time signatures and rich, textural complexity, boldly mixing acoustic and very hard rock sounds together in an excellent manner.  Truly amazing chord selections by Lifeson and Mandela usage is brilliant.  This album is probably their most complex yet.  Lyrically is very heavy and full of symbolism of hope and despair, underlining the progress of the \\"Chutes and Ladders\\" aka \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" game beautifully.  Lifeson empowers effects with flange and phaser, heavy 8-voice chorusing.  Basswork is phenomenal.  Drumming is so tight and bewilderingly complex it would take a drummer to master \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" (possibly Part I of the Gangster of Boats Trilogy [finally]) several months to master, if ever. <br />Malignant Narcissism embodies a Rage for Order Queensryche effect with voice-over similar to Limbo from Test for Echo.  Guitars are driving throughout but only when appropriate. <br />There are reminiscent scenes from songs like Driven and A Farewell to Kings and Hand over Fist. <br />Best way to describe album, \\"Very progressive, mix Test for Echo with A Farewell to Kings and pepper it with Presto, then add magic.\\" <br />Outstandingly complex.
0141439475|1.0|This particular edition uses the wrong text -- the bowdlerized 1831 text,rather than the original 1818 text.  Most Frankenstein editions do in fact use the 1831 text, which was the only one available for 143 years.  Then in 1974 James Rieger, in his _Frankenstein or, The Modern Prometheus: The 1818 Text_ (Chicago), compellingly made the case that the 1818 text is superior, in terms of both ideas and language.  Almost all scholars of English Romanticism were convinced by Rieger, and now prefer the 1818 text.<br /><br />Frankenstein really is a great work, containing profound symbolism, disturbing ideas, unforgettable images, and some of the most beautiful prose in the English language.  However, to appreciate these fully, it's necessary to have the best text.  Fortunately, several editions of the 1818 Frankenstein are now available, edited by J. Paul Hunter (Norton), James Rieger (Chicago), Susan J. Wolfson (Longman), and D.L. Macdonald & Kathleen Scherf (Broadview).<br /><br />The masterpiece, Frankenstein, was really written by Percy Bysshe Shelley, one of the greatest poets in the English language.  For this case, check out my own book, The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein.<br /><br />I would give Frankenstein five stars, but this edition merits only one.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Rush has always been strongest when addressing individualism, perseverence, hope and when they dip into a more impressionistic palette. In their best work, the listener gets to make what they will of the songs; they are ambiguous and personal at once. Whenever they get topical, the songs tend to stumble. Snakes and Arrows is one of these, to a pretty high degree. With the exception of Far Cry, there's not a lot a listener can bring to these tunes, as it's pretty plain what's being addressed. Which is a shame, because the music is, for the most part, very nicely put together. While not as purely powerful as a lot of the songs on Vapor Trails, the mix is leaps and bounds beyond that, their most recent cd of original material. While Lifeson owned Vapor Trails, Lee has some good standout moments as well, and you couldn't fit a dime into Peart's arrangements, they are so tight. Apart from my beef with the lyrics, my only real problem comes from Geddy Lee's bizarre choices when it comes to vocal melodies. This all began with a few moments in Roll the Bones, and really came into play on Counterparts. Really, many are real head-scratchers. Why does he have to stretch the final word in a stanza out like a piece of bubble gum? In places it sounds a bit silly, others completely ridiculous. In any case, not a bad CD, certainly not Rush's worst (that would be Counterparts), but it can't even touch their best work. Still, it's nice to see that the guys are still challenging themselves.
0060005696|4.0|Schwartz has interesting insight and the book is easy to read. Though some readers may find that Schwartz's ideas are somewhat old fashioned, this is coming from a reader that appreciates the choices available to him. But still I must urge people to read this book because you will begin to look at the choices you make more criticaly than prior to reading The Paradox of Choice. I will admit even though I do not agree with all of Schwartz's theories his knowledge on the psychological point of view of choices are invaluable.
B00079FUI6|5.0|When I first heard that a series about housewives was being put together, I couldn't help but laugh. When the show was named \\"Desperate Housewives,\\" I was in disbelief, to say the least. And when everybody started praising it and calling it the finest show on TV, I thought the entire TV population should take a holiday to a deserted island, where there's no cable. Boy, was I wrong - not only is this show the best and most original project on TV, it was also funny, touching and, above all else, incredibly smart.<br /><br />\\"Desperate Housewives\\" invites the audience to the seemingly glamorous lives of women of suburbia and their families. The squeaky-clean surface of the upper-middle class seems heavenly, but that is only its surface. Through our beautiful, perfectly cast leading ladies, we are about to see what life can bring even to the most privileged ones. Susan Mayer (played by Teri Hatcher) is a single mother desperately trying to find the right man. Lynette Scavo (the brilliant Felicity Huffman) is a mother of four, desperately trying to handle her syper children. Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria) is a spoiled ex-model who is desperately trying to keep her affair with her teenage gardener a secret from her husband. And finally, there is Bree Van De Kamp (played by the superb Marcia Cross), a perfectionist of a housewife, desperately keeping her house and relationship with her loved ones sterile-clean, in order to escape the obvious problems. Add a bunch of oblivious husbands, one attractive plumber (James Denton), one creepy family with a dark secret and at least one lady of loose morals (Edie Britt, played by Nicollette Sheridan), and you've got yourself a hot TV show.<br /><br />The reason this show works so well is that all elements were obviously thought out carefully and put together without a problem. The actors are all excellent, and they impersonate their roles so well, you never feel they might actually have a life in the real world, as somebody's wives or girlfriends. Although the focus of the show is primarily on Hatcher, she is outshined by Cross and Huffman. Cross brings fantastic, complex performances to bring the complex character of Bree to life, she is the real star of the show. Huffman, on the other hand, approaches her under-written and un-glamorous role with wit and reality, making Lynette a character that is always closest to our hearts because she is the most humane one. Hatcher and Huffman have their moments (the infamous scene where Susan locks herself out of her house in her birthday suit, or the even more popular car-washing by Edie), but they mostly provide comic relief. Finally, Longoria seems to be on the show mostly for her looks (she was appropriately titled the most beautiful woman on television), but it's not until the second half of season one that she gets to show off her talents, as her character gets more dimension.<br /><br />You simply cannot go wrong with buying this six-disk set. The residents of suburbia will keep you amused whether it's because of mistery, deceit, control, love or hate. Don't simply expect entertainment - expect an experience that will stick with you long after you're done with an episode. \\"Desperate Housewives\\" are not at all silly - it is a marvelous insight into human nature and the values of modern-day America. If you become a fan, you might want to check out [[ASIN:1932100792 Welcome to Wisteria Lane: On America's Favorite Desperate Housewives (Smart Pop series)]] for a collection of essays that are academic in style and approach the show in a scholarly manner, offering sociological explanation on why the \\"Housewives\\" have become a phenomenon.Although the focus of the show is primarily on Hatcher, she is outshined by Cross and Huffman.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|Just received my copy a few days ago and this CD helped me finish a commissioned trio painting project in just 3 hours, so that's saying something!  It has the right balance between driving, fast songs and songs and songs that are mellow and make you sit back and cry.  ALL the songs make you think, and that's why I appreciate Evanescence so much.  She doesn't take life, her Christianity, her mental health or even her own song writing for granted.  She appreciates and deeply discects each part of her life throughout this project.  It's easy to see how all of these aspects play off of each other and make up who she is and this is what mixes so wildly and beautifully to make her songs so magical.  Thank you Amy, and Evanescence, for some honest music with raw and unapologetic lyrics we need lately, when everything else is just written to rhyme and make a quick buck. ;)
B00005MNP7|5.0|Want to know if you should own this album? - well if you like rock and roll -  buy this album.  I own 3 LP's because i listened to this album over and over for decades and have worn out 2 of them so i own THREE.  It's my favorite Album of all time, of any album.  Obviously I'm a huge fan.  But if you are still wondering - well if you like Led Zeppelin, buy this - If you like the Beatles, buy this - If you like the Who, Buy this - If you like the Velvet Underground, buy this - If you Like David Bowie, Buy this.  Still need convincing - put it this way Andy Warhol picked The Velvet Underground and Blondie as the only 2 bands he ever supported and worked intimately with.  So if you want Artistic Greatness - this has Andy Warhol's vote - as he produced the artwork and visuals of the video for this album.
B000GFLAI0|2.0|I'm 15 and just resently started listening to Dylan since I discovered my moms old record colection, and I realy enjoyed all his stuff.  But when I picked up this ablum I was realy disapointed.  It sounds like stuff my grandparents listened to.  The lyrics are bad and not at all deep and the music, though played with good techneque, is just compleatly uninteresting.  I find it hard to not dose off wile listening. At this point he can play anything and his record will sell but I wish he would try just a little harder.
B000MZHW40|4.0|I do not pretend to know anything about the diamond trade. I don't know much about those who mine the stones from the ground or what hardships are suffered by those who transport the gems between the yielding earth and the finger of one's beloved. Perhaps that is the point of \\"Blood Diamond,\\" which tells the story of one Sierra Leonese family whose lives and fortunes are woven into the greed, violence and intrigue born of the diamond trade.<br /><br />The story of \\"Blood Diamond\\" is simple. In the 1980s, factions within Sierra Leone, in Western Africa, used the wealth gained from the diamond trade to buy the arms that fueled a brutal civil war in that nation. More guns made for more diamonds that made for more guns in an endless cycle of death. The interest of various groups and individuals collide in this mix of adventure, greed and brutality. Journalists seek the next big story; industrial mining behemoths seek their business interests; guerrillas seek power; mercenaries seek glory and cash; foreign soldiers seek to impose peace. Caught in the middle are ordinary families trying to live an ordinary, peaceful life.<br /><br />Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a fisherman whose family life is torn apart by the violence surrounding the diamond trade. Finding himself literally enslaved by it, he one day finds an enormous, rare pink diamond. He attempts to hide it but is spotted by one of his captors. He escapes, and the chase becomes the plot of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a South African mercenary seeking his fortune in the diamond fields. Jennifer Connelly is Maddy Bowen, a journalist looking to make her own fortune in the publishing trade. Along the way, these three help each other toward a deeper awareness of the price of the trade, the hypocrisies of those who profit by denouncing it, and the need to succor those destroyed by it.<br /><br />\\"Blood Diamond\\" is incredibly violent, though not especially gory. The battle scenes are rendered with anarchic and gut-clenching verisimilitude. The film does oversimplify the diamond trade by showing it in its worst light. Though it sometimes veers toward clich&eacute; (as with the Wary Renegade who trusts no one but whose actions on behalf of others redeem himself) it succeeds in humanizing a heretofore faceless trade. The diamond that graces your loved one's hand or earlobe may not have caused a family to die in violence. But does it allow the one who mined to live in a shantytown while the executive who runs the company lives in obscene wealth? \\"Blood Diamond\\" suggests that the answer to that question should matter.ed with anarchic and gut-clenching verisimilitude.

B000M5AJQS|1.0|An A-list cast is wasted in this overlong & unimaginatively scripted remake of an excellent Asian thriller. Relocating the action from Hong Kong to Boston the plot twists of the original are dutifully reproduced but writer Bill Monahan fails to add anything new. In the original story a gang of criminals have a mole in the police and the police have a mole in the gang. As cop and criminal try to ferret out the other each begins to wonder who he truly is. For example the mole in the police wonders where his real loyalty lies while the undercover cop fears losing his true identity. Scorsese's remake dispenses almost entirely with this rich theme & turns the mole in the police force (played by Matt Damon) into an inexpressive walking blank spot & DiCaprio (playing the cop turned criminal) into a panic stricken caricature. Jack Nicholson does significant damage to the movie by overacting appallingly as a gang boss with an obsession about informers, said obsession signaling an all too obvious 'surprise' revelation concerning his character.     In the original movie each of the leading men found comfort, along with an exploration of their identity crisis, in their relationship with a woman. But Scorsese's remake lazily merges the two women into one & in another unconvincing development has her sleeping with both of them! Of all the actors only Mark Wahlberg as a vulgar cop & Ray Winstone as Nicholson's psychotic enforcer make an impression.    As for Scorsese, who is now in his mid-60's, his direction here feels tired & unengaged. His trademark combination of contemporary music & classics with scenes of graphic violence lacks the impact it once had although it must be admitted that the mediocre material he's working with does him no favours. Unable to control Nicholson (or perhaps encouraging him to overact. Who knows?) The Departed feels - most notably in its silly 'let's-kill-everybody' ending - like a parody of his earlier gangster films. Slick, profane & violent but also hollow, superficial & juvenile, The Departed will be forgotten faster than you can say 'I'm shipping up to Boston.'
B00005JPO8|5.0|One of the best films I've seen.  I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can own a copy. <br /> <br />This film depicts a playwrite living in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).  A member of the Central Committee is attracted to the playwrite's wife, an actress, and directs the secret police to spy on the playwrite to find something he's done against the state.  The film reveals the personal struggle by those forced to live in a system that does not permit personal freedoms.  A superb film. My favorite part was the ending. <br /> <br />Whether you lived during the cold war or are too young to remember it, you should see this film.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I thought I was weened off Rush ages ago. This is purely an impulse buy, like visiting a long-time-no-see-friend. And Rush didn't disappoint me. Love that bit mixed in folky sound. Wind Blows is my favored track.
0783114893|5.0|And mom was right and so is this white knuckle \\"thriller\\" with (dare I say it) C. Thomas Howell's finest performance as Jim Halsey, A twenty-something young man driving a car west to California for a delivery service. After coffee, cigarettes, and loud music fail to keep him from getting sleepy he stops to pick up a hitchhiker in the rain. Unfortunately for him the hitcher is Rutger Hauer and he is one mean dude. No one in modern cinema(80's on thru to be exact) gives off a more palatable sense of menace as Mr. Hauer gives in this tight wound little movie. Once he comes on screen,driping wet(he even makes rain water running off his nose look evil) you feel him in every frame even when he's not on screen. Mr Howell is pitch perfect as the young man who picks up this loony dude and like fly paper can't shake him. At points in this movie you feel horrible form him as one one believes him that the hitcher is is killer and not him. This movie follows no standard Hollywood plot and is very much the better for it. Not once in this film can you guess what is coming next. This is one that has gotten better with age. One of the 80's best little \\"thrillers\\"

B000001GQT|5.0|This is another example of 'big' music, major works by Strauss by THE major post WW II German conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic. I probably would have never bothered to spend much time listening to Richard Strauss if it were not for the fact that the first few bars of 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' was the opening music for Stanley Kubrick's '2001'. And, I believe it was this version (or one sounding extremely similar to this one) which was used by Kubrick. As a fan of liturgical music, I have to say that Strauss' 'Zarathustra' may be thought of as 'anti-liturgical' music, since it takes its title and temper from the philosopher Friedrich Nietsche's most famous work, a distinctly anti-Christian, existential source document. The other works on this recording are also 'high' Strauss, especially 'Till Eulenspiegels lustige Streiche', a celebration of classic German folklore.<br /><br />There must be hundreds of 'Zarathustra' recordings, but if you must have at least one, this one is a winner, especially at the price.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|This show is so incredibly funny I can't believe I didn't watch it from the beginning! I just happened to catch it on tv during season two and loved it so much that I asked (and got!) season one for Christmas. Now I have watched the entire season one about ten times in three months. I loved Friends, but I hate to say this show is funnier. The humor is a little more intelligent and the people are genuinely loveable. I don't want to give away any plot but some of my favorite episodes are the new year's eve one, ok? awesome!, the [...] pumpkin.....actually I love them all. The show can be serious without you sitting there saying come on already and it's so unpredictable. Season two is great too and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD!!

B000EWBKM6|3.0|I love Will & Grace, but this finale was very disappointing....not as bad as Seinfeld's, almost as good as Friends' and not even close to Cheers'. Jack and Karen's duet got this the extra star. The end of the finale was TOO much with Will and Grace being old and their kids magically going to the same college with the same rooms and meeting up and probably dating. If I wanted that much closure I would watch the reunion show. It could have ended with them talking again after so many years apart, but the producers felt the need to go WAY into the future to try to enhance the nostalgia.

B000002UUX|4.0|To this day, Megadeth's \\"Rust in Peace\\" remains my all-time favorite metal album, one of the few that hasn't grown ridiculous and/or cumbersome over time. It deserves this in-length review, 17 years after its release. <br /> <br />The first track, \\"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due,\\" kicks off with a galloping bout of E-minor scale triplets--summoned from Dave Mustaine's enviable black-polished Jackson Flying V--which are soon accentuated by Nick Menza's tom tom pummeling. There are riffs galore, for nearly two minutes, before Mustaine's neutered wail of \\"Brother will kill brother\\" enters the scene, riffs that fluctuate from feverish, stuttering leaps to crunchy half-time power-chord progressions. The vocals soar over a rhythm figure that took me two and a half years to learn how to play while singing; with off-kilter switching between thirds and fifths, it smoothly adds fusion jazz into a fiercely distorted, decidedly metal mix. An over-the-top (yet somehow appropriate) flamenca lead from frizzy-haired Jewish guitarist Marty Friedman (making his debut as the only talented Megadeth lead guitarist to date) leads into an atonal caveman stomp with Mustaine's characteristic robot growl, depicting a first-hand account from soapbox leaders turned suicide bombers. Then the melancholy E-minor to C major bridge (my reason for existing, practically, upon hearing it for the first time in 9th Grade) unfolds, its denseness broken up by gorgeous open-string ringing; the same chord changes are played two steps up, with palm-muted arpeggios, under the two screaming Friedman solos that separate the bridge's vocal passages. Out of nowhere, a riff alternating between natural harmonics picked at Mach 10-speed and an earlier figure played double-time obliterates all the gloomy aesthetics of the bridge, and Mustaine's outro solo proves his rage at being kicked out of Metallica seven years earlier had scarcely subsided. \\"Holy Wars\\" is an incredible opener, maybe the best metal album opener besides \\"...And Justice for All's\\" \\"Blackened.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Hangar 18\\" continues on the subtle theme of Mustaine's harbored bitterness towards his former peers. The four rapidly downpicked chords in the intro are identical to those used in Metallica's \\"The Call of Ktulu,\\" which Mustaine received a writing credit for. Obviously, he wasn't about to see his original song mangled without proper revenge. \\"Hangar 18\\" tells of aliens cryogenically frozen somewhere in the Nevada desert, but this song is not at all memorable for its lyrics. It features no less than EIGHT guitar solos, each of them unpredictable, sometimes downright whacky. Spontaneously, the song shifts into an Arabian raga tempo midway through, with Friedman breathlessly mastering his Arabian scales. The song's five solo finale renders \\"Hangar 18\\" a veritable guitar aficionado museum, a textbook for wannabe shredders. <br /> <br />\\"Take No Prisoners\\" is a bit of a throwaway track, certainly lyrically (hell, they ALL are lyrically!) and somewhat musically, with a lot of stop-and-start teasing...and these are generic F# riffs from Mustaine's own back catalogue. Still, there's joy to be had in Mustaine's yowl of \\"Got one chance!\\" and the robotic response section bellowing \\"Infiltrate them!\\" There are a lot of \\"-ate thems!\\" to come. <br /> <br />\\"Five Magics,\\" about sorcery, for Christ's sake, has some beautiful tritonal arpeggios and a 5/4 stomp showing off Megadeth's versatility. <br /> <br />\\"Poison Was the Cure\\" has a bluesy bass intro (this is the only album where bassist David Ellefson's range is shown off to proper advantage) that leads into a mercifully short quadruple-time thrash about Mustaine's past heroin abuse (a common theme on the album, beautifully stated). <br /> <br />\\"Lucretia\\" may be the jazziest song in metal history. <br /> <br />But the album's true highlight is \\"Tornado of Souls,\\" a song adored by metal nutjobs and indie snobs alike. B-minor harmonics pave the way to the song's centralriff; spidery yet simple, crunchy yet steadily soaring, it's laid out in the key of B, but later on, the same riff is played under shifting chords that clash perfectly with its notes. A very similar progression, just different enough to warrant attention with its harmonized thirds, leads into perhaps the best metal solo of all time: never too much nor too little, with octave chords, sweep picking and (tasteful) finger tapping, the solo is the ultimate manual for how to reign in rock god excess. <br /> <br />\\"Dawn Patrol,\\" I believe, could have easily been excised from \\"Rust in Peace.\\" Gimmicky and lame, it's dominated by irritating Cockney-accent vocals and a show-offy blues bass riff. <br /> <br />Who knows what to make out of the lyrics on the album's final track, \\"Rust in Peace/Polaris\\"? \\"Eradication of/Earth's population loves/Polaris.\\" WHAT?! But never mind that. Alternating between tribal triplets and funky stomps, made memorable by Mustaine's crude yowl of \\"I spread disease like a dog,\\" it's a fitting closer to an exceptional album. The band was never in finer form, before or after, and it's pretty much the only record in which it's evident that the volatile Mustaine kept his ego in check.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|We love it, the whole family. It has replaced Cars and Cinderella as our 2 year old's evening movie of choice, and we actually don't mind seeing it for the 40 something-th time. The songs are great. It's interesting to see what we remember from seeing it as kids, and we catch ourselves singing the songs around the house, off-key but much to our 2 year old's delight. Another great thing to share with her. Probably our favorite Disney. Enjoy.
B000000H6D|3.0|Good album. But here's my in-depth review of \\"Christian Woman\\": <br /> <br />Type O Negative's \\"Christian Woman\\" is a delectable piece of goth metal cheese, an unabashed epic of gloomy synths, pigslop guitars and Gregorian chants about girls aching to f**k Our Savior. It toys playfully with the sexual themes implicit in conceits about how, exactly, lowly women envisioned Jesus Christ; there are indeed passages, in this book I read once containing religious material written by 14th Century Anglican laity, where you can practically see the bosoms bursting out of every chaste corset as the women plead orgasmically for forgiveness from their fallen lord. How undeserving he was to die, how undeserving they are to exist, how hot he looks on that crucifix--oh how they'd tear the walls down with headboard banging sex if his human form appeared before them. This is what I got out of it, anyway. <br /> <br />Not that this early '90s bombast has any such subtlety. \\"An image burning in her mind/and between her thighs\\" are the last words sung like a hymn over a minor-key Chorus synth setting before the guttural guitars and folksy vocal harmony come in, machine gun drumming every second measure. \\"She'd like to feel/Goo-oo-ooood/Inside of her, deep inside of her,\\" explains Pete Steel, the latter part in three different octaves, over the 12-string acoustic B part. It's simply gorgeous, these arpeggios played on strings tuned three whole steps down, as is the wailing guitar solo. <br /> <br />Because the song obviously can't only contain two parts, especially since they are so mellow, the C part should be all-out chaos, speed metal bliss along the lines of Metallica or Sepultura. But both lyrically and musically the C part is a bust. The chords underline a boring mid-tempo rock stomp, the church organ solo midway through is just hammy, and Steel merely sings \\"Jesus Christ looks like me\\" over and over again. What is this comparison supposed to mean? Has the woman actually been thinking about HIM, the rock God? How smug, to compare himself to Jesus so humorlessly, to tease the listener by suddenly taking all the religious context out of a song that seems to be deliberately sullying the pure, sexing up the mythology.

It is very rare to have a c.d so good that you don't feel the need to skip any tracks while listening.  I haven't turned it off since I recieved it two days ago! It's hard to even pick a favorite song, they are all SOOO good. It's just a fantastic album! <br /> <br />\\"I'm your man\\" is the sexiest song I think I've ever heard.  If I was a smoker,  I'd need a cigarette after listening to this song!
B000O178BY|5.0|First of all, Year Zero is obviously not With Teeth, although it does have some similiarities to The Downward Spiral. It is not as \\"radio-friendly\\" persay, and is not really an experience that you can just take in at one sitting. It is on the other hand (as is almost immediately noticeable) a more mature album, which conveys as much emotion and feeling as ever, but in a more focused and subtle manner.<br /><br />Although new Nine Inch Nails fans may want to start by exploring some of Reznor's earlier albums, this CD will most certainly appeal to anyone who has already become accustomed to (and appreciates) NIN's unique style.<br /><br />Personally, I know that I would give this album 10 stars if I could. It is the sort of CD that you can just put on repeat and soak in, gaining new insight into its message each time you listen to it. I would highly recommend this album to any NIN fans, or even to anyone who is sick of the standardized and commercialized noise that almost all other artists seem to be spewing out nowadays.
B00005JPAO|5.0|\\"Go ahead, admit it. Between the kerchiefs and the corgis, the sensible clothes and the semi-detached smile, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has never been mistaken for the most dramatic monarch in the world, never given much of a hint that there might be a Major Motion Picture in her life. But this immovable object has met the unstoppable force that is actress Helen Mirren, one of the great masters of modern screen acting. In a commanding performance that is as compelling as it is unexpected, she has turned \\"The Queen\\" into something you never imagined it could be: a crackling dramatic story that's intelligent, thoughtful and moving.\\"<br />Kenneth Turan<br /><br />Helen Mirren is extraordinary. Not only does she have the ability to take on the appearance of Elizabeth II, The Queen, she is able to reveal in small bits and pieces the humanity of Elizabeth II. Helen Mirren has said that in portraying a living person she imagines that person as a masterpiece painting. She is then able to take the brush and paint as she sees fit.<br /><br />The underlying story is the week the 'People's Princess', Diana dies. Tony Blair, as played by Michael Sheen, has been elected the new Prime Minister. Sheen's performance is sensational. He msut tell The Queen that she is mishandeling the death of Diana. At their first meeting the Queen has reminded Mr Blair, he is her tenth Prime Minister, and he needs to live up to the likes of Winston Churchill. And, this becomes Prime Minister Tony  Blair's fulfilling moment. Diana and The Queen had always been at odds. The Queen wore her emotions tightly locked up  and Diana wore her emotions on her sleeve.  Prince Phillip, as played by James Cromwell is aloof and distant and has no regard for the ex-Princess at all. The ploy to stay in Scotland at Balmoral Castle, for the children's sake does not work. The  public is clamoring for some statement from the Queen.  The Queen asks advice of the Queen mother played by Sylvia Syms, but she, too,has a stiff upper lip. Prince Charles, Alex Jennings, a more modern man, asks Tony Blair to speak to the Queen to provide a statement that is befittng the Princess.  A statement is prepared, but we can see the Queen has some misgivings. The public responds to the Queen's words.<br /><br />\\"Helen Mirren's allure lies not in finding what's regal in every woman she plays, but in finding what's womanly in every royal.\\" Entertainment Weekly<br /><br />I loved almost everyone in this movie. Prince Phillip not as much.  It was riveting at times and so revealing of the Monarchy that does not, can not, reveal its private nature. The movie is funny and touching in ways you can't predict. Stephen Frears as director, has completed a beautifully moving film, rich in detail. He uses real footage of the funeral and of Diana. We are finally allowed to see the real dignity in the Queen. The current state of the world is referenced when the Queen reminds Tony Blair that the 'people can turn',\\"one day, quite suddenly, the same thing will happen to you.\\"  I will never look at the real Queen Elizabeth II the same way again after seeing Helen Mirren's portrayal.

There's a great account of his involvement in the investigation of the Challenger accident. If you liked the \\"Surely you Must be Joking\\" this one is well worth it. Feynman is such a compelling guy, that (along with Douglas Adams) when reading his books I actually get bummed out that they're not still around and contributing to society.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I haven't passed judgement on this album yet but I thought I should weigh in with my two cents because after all this is the Twenty-First century. The CD packaging is nice, the art work is colorful and the fonts used look really professional. You know you're getting a quality recorded album because the CD doesn't say memorex or TDK or anything like that so you know it's good. The disk plays really smoothly too, no jitters or skipping to speak of. <br /> <br />If you like Rush I think you Should probably consider purchasing this album, as it is Rush and all.

B00005UEAR|3.0|I have a real love/hate relationship with Dream Theater.  On the one hand, the band's hyper-technical approach and constant commitment to the \\"rules\\" of progressive metal usually ensures that on any given Dream Theater album, there will be at least a couple of fascinating musical moments, an almost mechanical complexity which can be entertaining, and prompts to play \\"find the musical tribute\\" at least several times during the course of an album.  The downside, however, is that the band's \\"signature\\" original sound is weighted by blatant derivativeness, an inability to harness complexity to musical flow, and an overarching, almost smirking \\"aren't we clever?\\" attitude conveyed by an unwillingness to show restraint at the most inopportune moments.  My own \\"inner turbulence\\" stems from the fact that I'm always drawn in by the promise of futuristic sounds from Dream Theater, but that the band's work feels somewhat \\"off\\". <br /> <br />    \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" is one of the band's weakest studio releases, in large part due to the second CD of this two disk album.  The first disk shows a pretty fair amount of promise, albeit often blatantly derivative.  \\"The Glass Prison\\" features some pretty good heavy riffs, and an introductory super-fast series of guitar sweeps from guitarist John Petrucci, which would sound at home on a Symphony X album.  \\"Blind Faith\\" is the album's strongest track, as it not only sounds like a purely Dream Theater track (as opposed to mimicking another band), but it also features a great melodic instrumental turnaround in the middle of the song.  \\"Misunderstood\\" and \\"Disappear\\" are both somewhat derivative of Radiohead, but manage to be pretty decent songs, with the latter having some pretty hefty emotional weight, due to the almost disturbing use of keyboards.  \\"The Great Debate\\" is where the album starts showing its weak spots.  Starting with their pseudo-EP \\"A Change of Seasons\\", Dream Theater's lyrics have often been amateurish andlacking in subtlety.  With \\"The Great Debate\\", their attempt to address the topic of stem cell research falls prey to this weakness, and the blatant Tool homage on the musical side of things doesn't work here.   <br /> <br />    However, the side-long title track is what really sabotages this release.  The pompous \\"Overture\\" section really sets a bad tone for this song, as it sounds like a rehearsal for a Disney movie soundtrack.  The rest of this 40 odd minute song seems almost cobbled together artificially from outtakes from \\"Metropolis II: Scenes From a Memory\\".  The sacharrin sweet approach from that album doesn't work here, and attempts to \\"toughen it up\\" with heavier interludes such as the \\"War Inside My Head\\" section fail to balance things out.  It seems like the band was pandering to the same people who cried \\"sell out\\" when \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" was released.  The calls for a \\"truly epic\\" (i.e. 20 minutes or more in length) song from the fanbase should have been ignored until they had more solid material and a better, cohesive approach. <br /> <br />    \\"Six Degrees\\" barely eeks out a 3 out of 5, and only does so because of the presence of some entertaining material on the first disk.  While the band is slowly improving its collective skill at smoothing out the robotic aspects of its songwriting skills, this album doesn't quite show evidence of it yet.  While Dream Theater may admire Rush greatly, you wouldn't really know it when comparing \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" to Rush's very organic takes on the progressive rock genre.

0142000663|5.0|I liked East of Eden better, although, The Grapes of Wrath is Great History. But, I was under the impression that the Oakies came West in Horse Drawn Buggies because I thought that it had taken place earlier. Of course, I knew that there was a DUST BOWL. But, I didn't realize that the farmers were Sharecroppers that the BANKS had abandoned, so that the Land could be cultivated by MODERN TRACTORS. I thought that the LAND itself had gone BAD. But, that's not True. The farmers in Oklahoma were displaced by AUTOMATION. In fact, the tractors knocked their houses over because they didn't OWN the land.<br /><br />But, it took place less than 100 years ago, so that's Shocking because I thought that the country had a lot more ON THE BALL. In fact, it gave me a Stomach Ache because none of  the characters demonstrated (or manifested) the slightest CONTROL over their own Destiny. They followed their Noses. They were just like Lemmings. And the only people that Successfully ESCAPED were Single Men who didn't have any Family to worry about or worry about them (e.g., Connie, Casey, and Tom etc). But, Tom's ma gave him seven bucks so he could escape to Los Angeles because he was on Parole (in Oklahoma) and he had Killed somebody else (a Posse member) that had killed Casey, The preacher and Union Leader, right before his very Eyes (in California). But, Families couldn't ESCAPE. They were Stuck in a RUT. Just like a BLACK HOLE.<br /><br />The FOOD (?) that they Ate was JUNK: nothing but Lard, bacon fat, pork fat, and absolutely NO VEGETABLES (except for an onion once). They ate Fried Dough (which's nothing but flour fried in lard) everyday. And Meat (Hamburger, Bacon, Pork, and Salt Pork). NO EGGS. Bread and Potatoes occasionally. Some Fruit that they Picked at work. They had Coffee with some sugar. Biscuits with pork gravy was their main faire. I'd barf!!! They lived on GREASE that they should've Thrown AWAY. Therefore, they probably suffered from LEARNED HELPLESSNESS as well as chronic MALNUTRITION because they worked just for FOOD which was practically GARBAGE.<br /><br />But, the government Camp (in California) had HOT water and Toilets, so they were clean for the First Time in their entire lives, but they had to leave there soon because they ran out of money, even though they managed to survive the RIOT that the Sheriff had instigated at the Dance.

Perhaps, some of the Women could've cultivated some of that Excess Land to grow Vegetables for everyone in the Camp.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|All i can say is if u like rush or not listen to this album it is really really good.

B00005Q34G|4.0|This is a nice disc, but falls a little short in comparison to the majority of SACDs that I have.  First off, I noticed that it wasn't very loud, so you'll have to give it more volume than most.  Also, the disc is 2-channel, and I know that really riles some people. The Avalon disc was done much better for SACD, and is in 5.1.  I don't know what the story is on the rest of the material. I don't really mind a stereo SACD, especially if I find that it was an artist/producer decision to make it that way.  The Peter Gabriel SACDs come to mind on that subject.  I read an interview with PG about his remaster/SACD project, and he said that the decision to make the \\"Up\\" album the only 5.1 release was between him and the guy doing the DSD mastering.  Sometimes though, I think the people doing the SACD project just won't commit to doing the work for a 5.1 issue.  That does bug me a little. <br />Almost forgot:  the disc is made in Australia.
6305609705|4.0|Although Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS is normally cited as the premier literary inspiration for this landmark Francis Ford Coppola film, the voyage up the river is Homeric in its pacing, its cast of characters, and its staging. It is brilliant filming that takes one quickly past his expectation of seeing a 'war movie' and into the psychedelic mind of Coppola. Astonishingly, this film was released just four years after the last American troops left Vietnam, when the wounds were more than open. They were still bleeding.<br /><br />APOCALYPSE NOW is a psychodrama as much as it is anything else. The men on the boat that winds its way toward Horror are as much battling to maintain their own sanity as they are fighting anything recognizable as Charlie, an organized opposition.<br /><br />It is the Americans who come off looking most insane, so the relief that comes from seeing Martin Sheen's Captain Willard get back in the boat and head towards civilization is almost purely tribal. He's like us; ergo, he needs to go home.<br /><br />But Horror is before him as well as left behind in Apocalypse Now, the weird paradise that is hell and must be undone for larger reasons than the 'unsound practices' alleged by those who commissioned Captain Willard's Odyssey.<br /><br />I waited many years to see this film. It was simply never the moment.<br /><br />Now, fresh from a much-postponed first viewing, I consider it a fixed reference point for American cinematography *and* for America's long coming to terms with a war that in the end made no sense, even to those sectors of political leadership that had the most invested in it.<br /><br />The insights into wartime reality that here and there come under the camera's view are a bonus, but they are not this film's focus. It is instead a psychodrama that might possibly have staged its Homeric tale on almost *any* historical stage that was raw enough to bring insanity close to the surface. 'The War', as many of us refer non-adjectivally to the Vietnam conflict, serves that purpose well. But this Homeric tale might have been scened elsewhere.<br /><br />It it still arguable that America's involvement there made sense. APOCALYPSE now--like HEART OF DARKNESS--is not about that. It's about what's in a man's heart when civilization's thin veneer momentarily rubs away. That, says Coppola with good lineage ancient and modern, is just one thing. Horror.e well.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Just got the cd yesterday and on my 5th time through it. I have been a Rush fan since the late 70's. First concert was Permanent Waves. I have not been especially thrilled with some of their albums in the 90s but will say their Vapor Trails ablum rocks! And this one does not disappoint either. Love the instumentals songs. The song that really has caught my attention is \\"We Hold On.\\" I love the way Alex's guitar sounds...rock n roll! Rush is the true thinking man's band. Listen to this album, you won't be disappointed! <br />
B00005JPCF|1.0|STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!  SAVE YOURSELF!!!! SAVE YOUR FAMILY!!!!  RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!!!!!!  <br /> <br />3 adults sitting down to watch a movie.. I went in with LOW expectations, and came out laughing at how bad this movie was...  Heck, I watched the extras because I wanted to see what could possibly have been considered bad enough to cut out of this flick... Speaking of which, the director comes on and explains how Steve Irwin was such a great man, but they cut out his best scene.. haha How is that for pitiful! <br /> <br />My wife thinks it is one of the most cruel and bad movies she has ever seen. Mumbo cant catch a break.. he is constantly considered the outcast, constantly belittled, and constantly ridiculed.. It was just a joke how they continually kicked him when he was down! I mean towards the end, you see Mumbo looking down into the water, and you just know he is going to kill himself... Then he sees a little girl and starts dancing? Give me a break...... About the only time Mumbo ever gets a break is in the last 5 minutes of the movie, and at that point you are laughing cause the movie is sooo horribly bad.... <br /> <br />My friend who rented this movie couldnt stop apologizing to us for bringing this movie over... 5 minutes in we all started laughing at how bad it was, and I think we all said at least once that we should turn it off... But we just couldnt turn away from this train wreck... None of us could imagine it getting worse, but it did!! <br /> <br />I repeat... STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!! This movie tries to show how ignorant humans are, and in that regard I agree... Cause we have to be ignorant to spend money on a piece of trash movie like this....
0767803434|5.0|People don't often celebrate this movie for its timeliness and relevance but as world events unfold, it is steadily becoming more and more relevant in my humble opinion. This particular version doesn't necessarily add anything to the enjoyment of the movie. But to be honest it's hard to add to sheer perfection. This movie is well-plotted and very believable, even in the moments when you find yourself going \\"NO WAY!\\"<br /><br />Some have written it off as saying it depicts the \\"cowboy mentality\\" as if that's a bad thing. Some say that it's a training manual for terrorists that might wish to harm our own leadership.<br /><br />Personally I think it's merely a good action movie with a good moral to the story. Good will only triumph over Evil when Good learns to take its head out of its scared hind end and actually be willing to stand up for what's right.<br /><br />Until we are willing to have a back bone, the list of countries that are going to run right over is is ever growing. This movie cautions us not to let that happen. It's up to us to either listen or ignore this stark warning.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I hear the same stuff, \\"No where near as good as the older albums like(put any Rush album title here), they have lost it\\". This happens at every new release, and you know what? they are always wrong. This album Rocks, its all Rush, and then some. Stand out Tracks are Far Cry, Workin' Them Angels, Spindrift, Main Monkey Business, Hope, Malignant Narcissism, and one of the best album closers ever We Hold On. If you want some good music this year Get Snakes and Arrows and the new Porcupine tree album Fear of a Blank Planet.
1582701709|4.0|Some people say that its no secret, that there is nothing new. Others say that its all hype. Many say that its worth every penny. I believe that this book is very successful in causing varied but strong reactions in the readers. It is a concentrated happy pill in that you feel good about yourself and of endless possibilities after reading it. Some people take happy pills better than others. Some shouldn't be taking happy pills at all.  <br /> <br />I think that some of the negative reactions spawn from envy. Someone made a lot of money on the Secret and a lot of people think that they could have done the same. What they don't realize is that it takes a lot of hard work and talent to write a book that creates such strong reactions. The Secret is not for negative people.  <br /> <br />While I believe in the law of attraction and visualization I don't believe that you can just sit down, visualize, and wait for things to come. Its better to work with the law of attraction, visualize your goals, and then work as hard as you can to achieve those goals. Hard work breeds luck.

B00005JPFH|4.0|Incredible two first acts!!! then the horrible dancing scene.... and a rushed finale with the terrible live broadcasting of the final fight... <br /> <br />I think Raimi took to many liberties with this one... but this are only the things I didn't like, overall I feel it's a great movie, not on par with 2 but very good. I loved Gwen (in her two scenes in the movie...), the bugle stuff, Venom (making a cameo), Sandman (just for the sake of the visual effects) and the love triangle, I think Harry is the most interesting character in the movie. But there's to much happening in the movie, It's packed, even for a 2 and a half hour movie.   <br /> <br />In the end I'm very happy because we are seeing another Spidey movie, I can only hope that if they decide to do more movies they take more care of the material and aproach it in a more serious way, like they did in Spiderman 2. <br /> <br />Tonight I would see it again, maybe it gets better the second time... <br /> <br />Did I mention that it has the most incredible fighting scenes that I have seen in a comic book movie?
B00008J2PG|5.0|I love to read books and watch movies about War.  That sounds weird to some.  But here is why I like them.  Sure it shows man at his worst but it also show some at their best.  This is one that depicts both.  It's a wonderful story with great actors.  I thought allot for Gregory Peck.  I don't know if they were true to the actual events but in any case I highly recommend this DVD.  If your Catholic it's a must see.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This is a fun family game that needs 3-4 people to play.  I strongly recommend 4 people, as any less makes it too easy for everyone to win (thus having two+ winners at the end of the game). <br /> <br />The object of this game is to get rid of all your colored tiles.  If you have any tiles left over at the end of the game, you count up the blocks, and that's your score.  The person with the lowest score wins. <br /> <br />You can play this game with kids, wives, and buddies.  This game does not demand too much attention, so you can casually talk while playing this game too.  The game is strategic though, and also very addictive.  When you finish one game, you'll all want to play it \\"one more time\\", then \\"one more time\\" again. <br /> <br />I bought this game for $30 in the local mall, but it's nice to see Amazon will delivery it with FREE SHIPPING for even less money (AND NO TAX).  I strongly recommend this game.  You'll definately look at it and say \\"I bet it took $1 to make this game\\", but the game is so much fun to play.  My family asks that I bring this game every time we have a game night.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|I bought this the second I found out it was available for my husband who is a HUGE Waits fan. A gotta have!
B00007J36V|5.0|The problem with this album is that it always seemed to suffer, slightly, when compared to \\"What We Did on Our Holidays\\". Stylistically the albums form a natural pairing, but whereas its predecessor is a near perfect album, with every track complimenting each other perfectly, it always seemed to me that \\"Unhalfbricking\\" was by comparison a rather fractured affair with its various parts pulling the listener, a little too sharply, in different directions. In a peculiar way it always felt, as though it was only half a great record, but saying which bits are lacking is hard, as they all seem good or great when taken in isolation.     On the other hand the quality of most of its parts (if not the sum) is at a level most artists can only dream of. I should also point out that none of the above prevented this from becoming, and remaining, one of my best loved albums.     I believe that with the release of this version the album has finally attained the balance it always needed with the addition of the bonus tracks added for this release. They give the album that little more time required to absorb its disparate elements. With the addition of 'The Ballad of Easy Rider'(the best version of this song I have heard) the album finally has the majestic closing number it always needed and acts as a counterweight to the mighty 'A Sailor's Life' which seemed overly dominant at the center of the disc .     I already owned the previous CD version so it was with some reservations that I bought this one (only, in the end, because I needed to hear Sandy Denny's take on 'The Ballad of Easy Rider'), but I am glad I took the gamble. I always loved this album but now it's better than ever.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Well I have to say as one guy mentioned, you have to listen to this several times. It reminds me of Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti; you heard that the first time and thought huh, the same I felt when I heard the new Rush disc the first time completely through.     Pleasantly the sound and mixing is superb; and if you notice the new director seemed to push Alex's guitar superior talent more this time.      There are some beautiful guitar rifts as well as Geddy's bass and Neil's drum play.  The whole package is super.      The three instrumentals are refreshing and if the longer one, Monkey Business does not get nominated for a Grammy something is wrong. Of course I think the whole Hall of Fame and Grammmy thing is a political sham.      A band like Rush not being in the Hall of Fame is like the college FB Hall of Fame not having Barry Switzer in it until recently.    It will be interesting to see what the band uses as the set list for this tour.  They have pretty much put themselves in a position to have to go back to the roots, but I expect that Counterparts, Test for Echo, and maybe a couple of Vapor Trails.  But I think they have to keep some of the keepers like Red Barchetta, Zanadu, La Villa Strangiato, Natural Science and hopefully the entire 2112 28 minute set.  I would give anything to know what song they plan on opening with.  Alien Shore anywhere would be great. May be a difficult song to pull off as the starter.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Rammstein's best album, and this among a whole host of really good albums.  Nowhere else does the band rock as hard as they do here (and they always rock pretty damn hard).  Brilliant from mein Herz brennt in the beginnig to Nebel at the end.<br /><br />Fans should also keep their eyes open for the song Hallelujah, which is on the Links 2, 3, 4 single.
B000BNX3B4|2.0|I love chick flicks and I'm not afraid to admit it.  Also, I love chick flicks starring John Cusack.  I love his self-deprecating, boy-next-door charm and we got that one in this film as well.  However, Must Love Dogs is a dud in more ways than one.  Sarah Nolan (Diane Lane) is a divorcee in her late thirties.  Her meddling family members feel she should start dating again.  After all, she's been divorced for eight months!  So, her older sister (Elizabeth Perkins) places an ad at an online dating agency to force her sister to get back in the game.  The dates are disasters, especially one in particular -- a cute, sweet, but awkward and intense boat designer (Cusack) who is immediately smitten by Sarah, though the feeling is not mutual, for she's got her eye set on the father of one of her preschool students (Dermot Mulroney).  Which one is the right one for her?<br /><br />There are various things wrong with this movie. For one, it's boring.  It's also filled with cliches and full of the most embarrassing dialogue that great actors like Cusack and Lane should not be subjected to.  It is also not very believable.  Sarah must have had one heck of a brilliant divorce attorney.  That's the only way that could explain her owning such a big, beautiful house with a preschool teacher's salary.  Same goes for Cusack's character.  He makes boats that don't sell, yet he owns a chic loft.  And then there is the biggest flaw of all: no chemistry between the protagonists.  I don't know why Cusack's character (whose name escapes me) is so smitten by a woman who seems repelled by him for 95% of the movie.  There was absolutely no spark between them.  I don't know, perhaps I'm missing something here.  There are a few amusing moments though.  Elizabeth Perkins's character was wonderfully witty and she's about the only person with a decent role here.  That's about it.  I give Must Love Dogs two stars  because I managed to finish it up and because it features some rather cute dogs, but I could get cute dogs AND a nice story by watching Homeward Bound.I could get cute dogs AND a nice story by watching Homeward Bound.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Even after two years of listening to this album it still kicks in every way. Gritty, kenetic, and just plain cool. This album could've easily sat on the record store shelves in the mid-70's but thankfully we have something to place in the \\"oughts\\" - 00's. There are so few masterpieces that come out nowadays and I can only name a handfull over the last few years (Mars Volta - Deloused in the Comatorium, Procupine Tree - In Absentia, Tool - Lateralus...) and QOTSA - Songs for the Deaf can stand proudly beside these albums and wave the flag of butt-kick' rawk.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Quite a few of these new songs are going to be ones you will play over and over again in the future.  Far Cry gets it started right, and while I will admit to being frustrated hearing the rest of the cd the first go around, I've come around big time since.  Don't think its a return to the old \\"glory\\" years (as some had led us to believe) either, Neil's lyrics these days just won't support that type of song anymore. You will have to be satisfied with an instrumental to get the fast and furious bass, guitar, and drum licks, and they deliver a couple great instrumental tunes starting with The Main Monkey Business. The way too short Malignant Narcissism is another one that rocks from start to finish.  At least Alex has decided that guitar solos are fun to play again, and Neil is, well, Neil.  Yes, I wish there were only 6 songs on Snakes & Arrows full of Freewill and Tom Sawyer type bass and guitar jams, but that's just not going to happen anymore folks, get used to it.  Go to the concert to relive the past. <br />And they will be great to see at the concert, watching Rush play live gives a whole new insight to how much their songs really rock than listening to the studio version, including Snakes & Arrows I'm sure.  <br />Remember some of you old and picky Rush fans, the boys are well over 50 now and can still easily jam better than most of these new \\"rock\\" groups. <br />So cut them some slack and enjoy it while it lasts, see you at the show.  I'll be the white guy air drumming..... <br />
B000OCXF0Q|1.0|Being a teenager in the Eighties I had enough of \\"Hey Micky\\" it was bad then and it's bad now. Avril was nothing but throw away pop on her first record, but her second record was like an entire other person and it was very good. This, This, This??<br /><br />This is terrible. Not just a let down, but a bad, bad record. The lyrics are strung-together cliches that required no effort, the music sounds programed and the style is pure, unadulterated, pop garbage. She stepped right in to fill the void left by Britany Spears, that's what she did. Also, it appears she is suffering from Fergie worship.<br /><br />Please, please, someone get her some Tori Amos, Alanis, Sarah McLachlan! Anything to stop her from recording this bland, boring tripe! Why waste the talent shown on the second record, why waste my time and money on this disk. I won't, I downloaded, I deleted. Bad, bad record by any standards.<br /><br />My teeth where rotting from listening to it, it's that sugary.
0345360338|5.0|This second volume in a trilogy about the contentious history between Britain and Wales is first of all a magnificent character study.  At the heart of the novel is Simon de Montfort, a French-born aristocrat who travels to England in 1231 to boldly reclaim the lands taken from his family when his father was falsely accused of treason.  Montfort will use these heavily mortgaged lands as an entr&eacute;e into the court of young King Henry, the feckless, indecisive king of England.  Simon soon falls in love with Henry's sister, Nell, a widow who impulsively dedicated herself to God after her first husband's death.  Their love is forbidden because of Nell's vow and because of Simon's humble birth.  Gambling on Henry's goodwill, Nell and Simon marry, setting in motion events that will affect Western history. As Henry's ineptitude as king becomes more and more evident, Simon and a group of fellow aristocrats rebel.  One of Simon's staunchest allies is Llewelyn, the uncrowned Prince of Wales, grandson to the Welsh leader who brought Henry's father to his knees. Llwelyn is dedicated to his grandfather's vision of a united Wales that can withstand the might of the British empire.  But Llewelyn's ambitions are thwarted by the machinations of his brothers, Owain and Davydd who hunger for their own share of power governing Wales.  \\"Falls the Shadow\\" is the story of two great men:  Simon de Montfort, who set the stage for modern parliamentary government and Llewelyn, who sought to protect and save his country from destruction.  Both strong-willed, ambitious men, they share the strengths and weaknesses that ultimately doom their endeavors.  Simon is a man of honor who genuinely believes that all men should act selflessly in favor of principles which are more important than individual profit.  His nobility blinds him to the self-interest that compels his closest allies to betray him.  This vivid novel brings to life the characters and the setting of medieval England.

0375758992|4.0|Set in Africa, this marvelous, unusual memoir provides a very different view of the world which has been written about in the works of Isaak Dinesen and \\"The Flame Trees of Thika\\". These famous novels have chronicled an idealized life where whites live in harmony (and domination of) the black natives.   Alexandra Fuller world is a very different one.  She was the third child of Nicola and Tom Fuller, impoverished white South Africans who are doomed to be on the losing side of the struggle between native Africans and the white establishment.  For almost twenty years, Alexandra follows her parents from country to country seeking that perfect white utopia where the natives don't rise up and seize control of the government.  The family farms tobacco and runs cattle ranches, struggling to make a living in a world where white domination is fading.  Her father spends most of his time away from home, patrolling the countryside against black rebels who sweep down on isolated farms and butcher all the inhabitants.  Little five year old Alexandra knows enough not to visit her parents' bedroom in the middle of the night; they might shoot her with the shotguns they keep on the floor. Nicola Fuller is a relentless drunk, whose overwhelming sorrow over the loss of three of her five children and her bitterness over the rise of black power sends her seeking oblivion nearly every night. Despite the underlying despair that engulfs Alexandra's family, she somehow manages to imbue her story with dark humor and unflinching insight into the strength her parents display.  Nicola and Tom Fuller are courageous and resilient people who manage to instill self-sufficiency and resourcefulness in Alexandra and her older sister, Vanessa.  Alexandra has crafted a superb story that will capture the reader's imagination and engage their sympathy and admiration.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Musically, the boys have reinvented themselves again.  The songs are quite memorable, well-crafted examples of modern rock, utilizing Prog-influences with touches of classic rock, country, and (to my surprise) even some pop-style melodic lines. Neil has added some new fills to his skin-pounding vocabulary, and Geddy (as always) lays down some great lines for bass players to stay up late at night learning.  Alex, in particular, plays with a musical confidence and sense of balance which can only come with years of experience.   <br /> <br />While the music, as a whole, is catchy, it may not stand the test of time.  After a few listens, this reviewer found himself bored.  Unlike the Rush songs of the past, wherein there was always something new to discover even after listening to a piece for years, these new songs are satisfying only in the short term.  They soon lose their sheen, like a pair of cheap new shoes, which look great in the box, but after a few days of wearing them, they begin to fall apart and can no longer provide adequate support for the \\"snakes and arrows\\" of life. <br /> <br />Lyrically, the album disappoints.  Whereas in the past, Neil wrote from the perspective of an observer, allowing listeners from a variety of viewpoints to appreciate that which was clearly a personal reflection, Peart now seems intent on pronouncing universal and sweeping judgments with regard to his observations.  Lines such as, \\"We hold our beliefs as a consolation\\" and \\"You can call me faithless,\\" among others, seem, in the first instance, to presuppose an audience who shares Peart's bold assertions, and in the second, to demonize those who do not, as would a petulant child.  These and other lines are grating and self-indulgent distractions from what is, on the whole, enjoyable music. Gone, it seems, are the Rush lyrics which could invite the listener to view life from Neil's perspective, rather than push away those who do not, as is the case with Snakes and Arrows. <br /> <br/>Sonically, the album is a standout.  As other reviewers have commented, Vapor Trails was quite a disappointment, what with issues stemming from \\"clipping.\\"  While Snakes and Arrows is not entirely \\"clip-free,\\" it has a grand sound to it, much of which is due to the use of acoustic guitars which add needed moments of dynamic contrast, something sorely lacking on Vapor Trails. <br /> <br />Musically, the album is a solid 4.  Lyrically, a 2.  The law of averages being what it is, the album rates three stars.
1400063515|4.0|Definitely worth a read (along with fooled by randomness) for the ideas it presents.  However, the author is deeply and passionately in love with every aspect of himself, his ideas, his ancestry, his lifestyle and his friends and is not afraid to express his feelings.  Despite the author's commments that editors are worthless, this book is Exhibit A in their defense.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I love this new CD from Michael Buble.  My favorite track is \\"Everything\\".  It is a very upbeat and romantic song.  \\"The Best is Yet to Come\\" is such a fun optimistic song.  All of the instruments compliment Michael's vocals well on this song.  \\"Me and Mrs Jones\\" is another standout track. Michael's vocals on this song are very smooth and enjoyable.  I love his rendition of this classic song.  \\"Lost\\" is a sad song.  It has a beautiful tone though, and I really like it.  \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" is an uptempo track.  Boyz II Men lend their vocal talents on this track.  This track sounds so groovy.  \\"Always On My Mind\\" is another excellent track.  The piano playing by David Foster is very pretty here.  \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\" is an up tempo high energy track that makes me get up and dance.  The music on this CD is very entertaining. I recommend this CD to anyone who loves music.
1582701709|1.0|My previous review appeared, then disappeared, for some reason.  So, let's see if this one vanishes as fast.<br /><br />It never ceases to amaze me just how gullible people can be and I feel genuine sadness and pity for those who find here anything other than another monument to childish, immature, magical-thinking bordering on the insane.<br /><br />This is snake oil, people!  I have to give credit to the author/publisher, though. The real 'secret' is that slick marketing works, and there are fortunes to be made out of snake oil.  And, in a consumer society, so long as there are gullible people with low intelligence and a disposable income, they will continue to be made.  Which is good news for everyone involved - apart from the schmucks with more money than sense.
B000006045|5.0|This was the first Massive Attack album i bought.  it doesn't sound like it's been almost ten years since this came out, it just has this timeless feel to it.  Massive Attack has, ironically, done everything they have set out to do on this album, and that is be exactly who they are by trying to escape who they have become.  i know that that may sound kind of strange, but it makes sense.  The label \\"trip-hop\\" is something they have always loathed, despite the fact that they were pioneers of it, and i find it ironic that this album is one of the (if not THE)preeminent examples of this style.   <br /> <br />\\"Mezzanine\\" is like the \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" of trip-hop, and of Massive Attack's career.  i don't care how many more albums they release, this will always be the best one.  however, i do disagree with some reviews that label this album as heavy metal.  Massive's music always seems to come close to style, but shies away. there are shades of everything reggae, hip-hop, metal, ambient, but i can't say that there is enough to pinpoint it down in general.  again this is something that i find unique to trip-hop, never quite getting at what it wants to be stylistically but coming very close.   <br /> <br />continuing my comparison to \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" the first obvious parallel is the structure of the album.  the songs fit so perfectly together, that while some may not be great songs, it is how they fit in relation to the others that makes them work. the track \\"exchange\\" while seeming stupid to other reviewers i find to be a wonderful midpoint break between the four track barrage to open the record and the second half. unfortunately though, in similarity to the Beatles and all great bands, landmark albums lead to destruction. The Beatles were never the same after Sgt. Peppers breaking up barely three years later.  Massive, while still barely clinging to 3D and Daddy G, have lost a bit of edge.  The creative juices only flow so far and i think the gas has ran out a bit. but whatan incredible record!!!
1591396190|4.0|I have just finished reading the book and must say that its status as a bestseller is very well justified. The basic premise is very thought provoking in and of itself- you can grow your business by finding `blue oceans' ie. spaces where you do not face head on competition- spaces being literal physical markets, or consumer segments or positionings. Goes almsot counter intuitive to the almost automatic assumption that to grow you have to strive to gain share from a competitor- and that's where the beauty of the book lies. <br /> <br />Having said that, I shied away from giving 5 stars- because, having seen all sorts of theories come and go in the course of my career, I must say that its always dangerous to take any approach in isolation. The key is BALANCE- for any business, finding blue oceans alone will never work out- you will face some red oceans- especially when you're up against a much larger competitior- and also true blue oceans - new technologies, segments etc- are sometimes also riskier in terms of investments and chances of failure- as you may be entering unchartered waters. So while this book does an excellent job of raising great questions about how to grow a business, do remember to keep this balance in mind as you apply the concepts to your business. <br /> <br />- Mainak Dhar, author, [[ASIN:0470822295 Brand Management 101: 101 Lessons from Real-World Marketing]]
031286504X|5.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" a short, succinct novella penned by sci-fi and horror genre legend Richard Matheson gives ample evidence why he served as inspiration for notable authors such as Steven King and Dean Koontz.  Matheson whose creative talents spawned a myriad of memorable Twilight Zone episodes, fabricated a modern day twist to an ancient myth, the vampire.<br /><br />Californian Robert Neville seemingly is the sole survivor of a bacterial plague capable of turning those afflicted into vampires.  Sequestering himself into his impregnable, fortified house he survives the nightly onslaught of vampires desperate to lure him out and feast on his blood.  Hanging onto his sanity by a thread after enduring the death of his family and three years of daily sojourns where he destroys as many of the undead as he can uncover, he is ready to give up.<br /><br />Matheson, however, provides Neville with a ray of hope as first a stray dog and then another female survivor appear.  Do these signs portend a new beginning or the end of the world that we know.  Matheson provides a curious twist as he answers that very conundrum.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|If you love New York, and the journey of a chic, city girl, Breakfast at Tiffany's is for you! Audrey Hepburn is a wonderful portrayal of Holly Golightly, with her wild, crazy and disorganized lifestyle, trying to find the perfect man. It mirrors my life and search for love perfectly! When Paul Varjack (George Peppard)kind of \\"falls\\" into her life, she is so ignortant of the obvious attraction to him, she ends up engaged to a rich tycoon from the high society. Holly's complexity and vulnerability is revealed throughout the movie, which is a great character development that she acts out well. If you love romance, get this movie!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I purchased Snakes and Arrows on release, as I always do on a new Rush album. And as usual, I just can't wait to tear off that cheap and irritating plastic wrap over the cd and get to business. And that is where I will start this review, and where any cheapness ends.     From the wonderfully crafted cd case to the fine arrangement of visual stimuli in the pamphlet of lyrica and credits, to the 13 tracks of hard wonderfully spontaneous work... Rush has created a masterpiece for fans and new fans alike to enjoy. Thank you Rush (and Ben Mink).    My first impression on the first listen thru was perplexia to be quite honest. That... very quickly dissapated however, and it is not unsual for me to react that way to a first listen to a new Rush album (im sure i,m not the only one). After all, I get so used to the other albums that when a I listen to a new Rush album I often react to the progressiveness with a \\"hey, just who do you think you are buddy?\\" kind of mentality. However, and over the years and the seemingly millions of listens of thier other albums, I have learned one constant that hasn't changed. My first impressions rarely last long. With each repeat of the album I listen too, I like it more and more (I'm even listening to it now while I write this review). And although i'd like to baffle readers with a concise and intelligently laid out masterpiece-of-a-review, I just keep coming back to the word \\"WHOA!\\". As Alex Lifeson once summed up a prior album (and I'll quote him here) \\"there is a lot of meat on dem bones\\". Well said Alex. I was so thrown off by the complex arrangements and new and refreshing/uplifting tracks, I had a hard time at first just listening, and enjoying them. That time has passed (sips coffee). And while it will take me some time to decipher the Peart code of human struggality (thats my word you can't have it) I do believe that I have already understood this album emotionally (thanks to the wonderful music).     Some things that stand out forme on this album were the 3 instrumentals, I applaud them. Also, Alex really seems to have tapped into a different and energetic expression i've yet seen from him. He really stands out for me most on this album the most for some reason. Unfortunate to some, there are much less lengthy guitar solo's that they will be able to air guitar too, however... I find his new work simply entoxicating. His guitar riffs on The Main Monkey Business are so clear and sharp and powerfully moving, I just can't stop listening. Also noted are the atmospheric/transporting arrangments that seem to just sweep me off my feet and fly me thru a wonderful world of guitars and drumlike organized mayhem. Rush hasn't held back, you can almost feel all the years of experience tapping you on the forehead to ask \\"Are you listening?\\".    I think that if the seemingly immortal sound of Rush ever gives way to old age and well, mortality ... I think they should replace the current definition of Progressive in the Websters Dictionary with one simple word (as a tribute), -Rush. They truly progress in every way possible. And as we all know, constantly award us with consistant challenging themes and audio pleasure. This is one album that will not dissapoint. Just be open to the new sound and don't be afraid to embrace it. I promisssssss you, it won't bite. :)~    Carl Garrard, photographer [...]
B000NHPCS0|2.0|Another typical hollywood shoot em up ending where everybody dies. Scorsese had a great movie going until the end, but instead of coming up with a realistic or thought provoking ending he sold out for the easy box office cash cow and killed everybody off. Obviously his academy award win was more of a life time achievement award than it was for this movie. If you want to see a really good gangter cop movie rent Donnie Brasco. But I must give you fair warning; the ending may be boring if you're male and between the ages of 15 and 25.

B000NA2776|5.0|I have waited for sooooooooo long for something like this! I love all songs, I love that each song has it's own personality and no two songs sound alike like many other albums out there where you can't tell one track from another.     Mika's vocals are amazing, he has a wide range and his falsettos are unbelievable. I have grown listening to great music from my uncles and aunt's collections, Queen being my best band of all times. I was and still am, fascinated by those artists that dare to be all they can be and go beyond their wildest fantasies to create the best and most inovative and original albums. Take a Elton John, Prince, or as I said before, my favorite of all, Freddie Mercury. He dared to be different and the results speak for themselves.     Life in Cartoon Motion is a constant surprise. Song after song you get a different and refreshing sound, thus you never grow tired! It is also a feel-good album, it makes your imagination wander and your soul happy... I adore working out while listening to it in my iPod because it makes me forget the pain :)     After Freddie Mercury passed away I wondered if there would ever come someone else as daring, multifaceded and talented as him... then along comes Mika! Being this Mika's debut album, it might be too soon to say he is the next superstar, but so far, I am willing to give it a chance and choose to believe he will continue to grow and be as great as The Great Freddie!     I higly recommend this album.
B0002VEW1K|5.0|I am an old Procol fan.  They are still my favorite band after all these years, so I might be a tad biased.  But, to me, this album is just good solid Procol from their halcyon days.  Whether you are a fan of the band, or you are into the kind of progressive rock they performed, no collection is complete without this one.  If you are new to them, then this is Procol Harum at their best.
0784011680|5.0|My daughter was lucky enough to grow up with depression-era grandparents, and was exposed to Chaplin's work through her relationship with my dad. Now 16, she recently read Chaplin's autobiography for a school project, and I wanted her to see Downey's performance in this remarkable movie. She was quite struck (as was I) at Downey's portrayal of Chaplin. The movie is a great companion to Chaplin's book, and a compendium to our silent film collection.

0066620996|5.0|Sometimes, what makes for success in the marketplace is not fancy gadgets, the latest management fads, great technology, or expensive consultants. What it takes is a ruthless focus on the fundamentals- and that is the beauty of Good to Great. Based on a comprehensive study of Fortune 500 companies, it lays out principles that enable a company to make the transition from `good' to `great'- the interesting thing is that in and of themselves, they aren't rocket science- such as finding what you're really good at, getting the right people, implementing with discipline- but what makes the truly great companies stand out is their ability to deliver on these with consistency and discipline.<br /><br />That is perhaps the greatest lesson of this book- the importance of just doing the right thing, over and over again, right every time. Its always tempting to get distracted by short term business pressures, to jump from one fad to the other or to fall prey to the all too human tendency to `get bored' and want to do something new. The importance of disciplined execution is the biggest less you could take away from this book.<br /><br />- Mainak Dhar, author, [[ASIN:0470822295 Brand Management 101: 101 Lessons from Real-World Marketing]]
B000NVIXFK|5.0|It's breathtaking how good this new Rush album is. I have one word for the unsure: \\"Spindrift.\\" Quite simply it's just as complex, heavy and brilliant as anything Rush has ever done. And I say \\"ever\\" as someone whose first Rush album was 2112 and who has followed Rush closely ever since. \\"Spindrift\\" is, in 5 minutes and 23 genius seconds, a phenomal summary of everything that has made Rush one of the most respected bands in rock.  <br /> <br />Not to disregard the rest of the album- \\"Spindrift\\" is just an example of how, if anything, Rush has gotten finer with the years and has honed its craft to epic porportions. The rest of the album is strong, strong, strong. No filler. All killer. <br /> <br />They not only sound great, but in many ways they sound as if they've never gone away. It's amazing to look at a band releasing new music after 30 years and to count their newest release among their finest works, especially when they have a catalog containing milestones such as \\"2112\\" \\"Permanent Waves\\" and \\"Moving Pictures.\\" But this record easily ranks with those. If you're new to Rush, this record is a fine place to begin.
B000FVNX2Q|2.0|IF YOU PLAN TO USE THIS CALCULATOR ON ANY EXAMS OR COURSES OR INDEED PROFESSIONALLY IN THE FIELD, MAKE SURE YOU EXPLORE ANY OTHER POSSIBLE PROGRAMMING DIFFERENCES IN THIS DEVICE VERSUS THE TRIED AND TRUE AND TOTALLY WORKABLE HP-12C GOLD CASE.  Do this on the \\"25th Anniversary\\" HP-12C: f 2  20 ENTER CHS 2 [x] The device unbelievably displays \\"40.00\\", NOT \\"-40.00\\" (negative fourty!). Ok, do that on the Gold case HP-12C or the original HP-12C Platinum! Here goes: 20 ENTER CHS 2 [x] The Display correctly shows \\"-40.00\\"! This issue was taken to my attention by an engineer in Georgia who purchased my HP-12C book from amazon. I do not take any \\"credit\\" for discovering this latest issue vis a vis this device!  Try this on the Gold Case HP-12C: f CLX 360 n 6 g i 100,000 CHS PV PMT  This gives you the monthly payment needed to amortize $100,000 at 6% interest over a 30 year period. Now, DO NOT CHANGE anything! Let's assume  that the annual interest rate is LOWERED to 5.75%! DO THIS: 5.75 g i PMT.  This gives you the monthly payment needed to amortize the amount in question but at a wee lower interest rate! Ok, what is the DIFFERENCE in the monthly payments? SIMPLY PRESS [ - ]. This causes the GOLD CASE or  for that matter the ORIGINAL HP-12C Platinum to subtract the second amount calculated from the first amount! Try the same calculation on the \\"25th Anniversary Platinum\\"! You get a totally different result BECAUSE THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY PLATINUM'S STACK DOES NOT--AND I REPEAT DOES NOT WORK-- LIKE THAT IN THE ORIGINAL HP-12C OR THE ORIGINAL HP 12C PLATINUM!  This device is admittedly faster than the Gold case HP-12C. But, so what?  Let me put it this way, IF ANY OF US COULD USE EFFECTIVELY EVEN 0.25% OF THE COMPUTING POWER OF A GOLD CASE HP-12C ON A DAILY BASIS, WELL, OUR INCOMES WOULD GO OFF THE CHARTS!  Ok, the 25th Anniversary HP-12C is faster, so shooting from the hip, if we could use, say, 0.24% of its power effectively on a daily basis our incomes would go off the charts!The 25th Anniversary HP-12C has a \\"fancy\\" case! I threw mine out! I stick with the THREE HP-12C GOLD  devices I have! (New case is way too bulky, BUT it does have a rather HUGE HP logo on it and you can \\"stuff\\" a business card in it if you are inclined to show-boat it!)! Frankly, I wish that HP had saved the money from the \\"fancy\\" case and written new instruction-set/whatever for the admittedly faster chip that is in the 25th Anniversary HP-12C, thus making it work exactly like the Gold Case original HP-12C.  Bottom line: There are no \\"easy\\" answers to anything in this field! No calculator--and certainly no fancy calculator case!--, be it the Gold case (overall my choice because it works exactly as a GOLD CASE HP-12C SHOULD WORK!) will save anyone! No, we won't \\"rise above the croud\\" using any calculator, even the HP financial calculators! One could have a Super Computer and if you do nothing in the field, be it finance or real estate or whatever, your income will be zilch! Again, there are no easy answers: success in anything is a function of one's efforts in life, not the calculator we carry or train with, but in any event there is no question as far as I am concerned that anyone studying real estate or finance or business/etc should have one of the HPs, be it the best of the lot as far as I am concerned, the HP-17BII or the HP-19BII, or any version of the tried and true HP-12C.  Please Note: The program on page 284 of my \\"Professional Real Estate Problem Solving Using the HP-12C\\" works fine (as it should!) in the gold case and first version of the HP-12C platinum but it will not work in the \\"new\\" 25th Anniversary HP-12C Platinum because the STACK LIFT in the 25th Anniversary Platinum works different in a number of situations.   For those of you who acquire my HP-12C real estate book please note that I include a separate spiral bound supplement that includes a slightly different version of the program from page 284 of the main book. This program works just fineon the 25th Anniversary HP-12C; not a problem one way or the other!  Bottom line? Probably makes little difference which HP Financial calculator we own, but we should own at least one of them if we are studying real estate, business or finance. These are really neat devices, a tribute to the TECHNICAL and MATH PEOPLE at HP. Bravo folks!  John A. Tirone  Macomb Township, Michigan 48042
B00005JPD0|3.0|Did you watch Deja Vu and think to yourself, \\"Where have I seen Denzel Washington's character before? Am I experiencing Deja Vu while watching Deja Vu?\\"<br /><br />Either a major coincidence has occurred every time Denzel was cast for his last 23 movies where each director successively said to him, \\"Could you play the same character you played in your last movie?\\" Or Denzel has just found a character comfort zone that he knows the audience will love every time. And indeed the Denzel character works. The last time I saw Denzel not playing the same character that he was playing in Deja Vu was all the way back in 1992's Malcolm X (he played Malcolm X).<br /><br />Deja Vu was a good movie. I was entertained from start to finish. Good story with good story flow. Suspenseful. Some good twists. But you'll need to open up your imagination to director Tony Scott's attempt at how time and space can be shifted.<br /><br />The whole time travel thing can often be very confusing, and if a director isn't careful (or just chooses not to try too hard), continuity issues can come crashing down on an otherwise good story. Scott pretty much goes with the latter in Deja Vu.<br /><br />Time travel, as futuristic and Sci-Fi fantasy as it is on its own, is muddled by \\"The How\\" in Deja Vu. I am a spoilers biggest adversary, so I won't give out the details of The How, but I will say that the director relies on the viewers playing along with a weak time travel explanation a-la, \\"Okay...we'll bite...the machine allows you to move through time,\\" instead of presenting a \\"hey-that-could-happen\\" concept.<br /><br />So in Deja Vu you get to see Denzel Washington in a role acting exactly as you would expect him to act (good but familiar), and you get a story that'll keep you interested for all 128 minutes.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This CD totally caught me by surprise. Normally when I listen to an album for the first time, I got through every song only liking a couple initially and then the rest growing on me over time. This was not the case with this one.

B000N3ST9I|3.0|Machine Head peaked in burn my eyes. What followed with MH was that certain band members left and they repatched the band to do  Supercharger which was an awfull sellout to rap rock.theyre albumS that followed up to this one was a failed attempt by MH to imitate every metal trend at the time such as grindcore, mallcore. Now we have this album which is an attempt to go back to Burn my eyes which was a thrashy album. I guess MH figured that thrash and pure metal are making a comeback so we'll just follow another of the latest trends. The blackening fails to recapture the good musicianship and catchy grooves of Burn My eyes. The songs are OK but, none stand out. There is a lack of cohesion with every track. Each song is long and is with way to many diverse notes. Rob Flynn still can sing, I'll give him that. Its a shame that MH lost their identity since their first album and have failed to find originality since.  <br />
0399215980|5.0|I loved this book.  Because it has hardly any dialogue, it challenges the imagination of the \\"reader.\\"  It can be read over and over with never having the same story.  Having read it to my two toddlers, I have always told the story in a positive light where the mouse plays with all of the animals along his way home.  At the end of my version of the story, the mouse finds his brother or sister where they run off to their special fort.  Each time I've read it, the story and dialogue have been slightly and sometimes widely different from the other times.  I think that the book opens up so many possibilities and stretches the imagination.  For young toddlers flipping through the book on their own, it also encourages that the pages be turned in order as the mouse follows the tail of his next friend and leaves the child to figure out to which animal each tail belongs.  The pictures are colorful and simple and as beautiful as any of pictures of other Eric Carle books.  Highly recommended for those who like open-ended stories!
B00000K29E|5.0|This is unlike anything you've heard! Yes, there is plenty of Janis Joplin in this album, but there is also so much Big Brother and the Holding Company! You have both male and female voices on this album! Janis Joplin shines, and the best song on the album is \\"Call on Me\\" it's nothing like you've ever heard. Janis is at her best, and there is another version of \\"Call on Me\\" on this album. This is a must for any Janis Joplin fan.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I am a big Austin fan and have seen just about all of her movie adaptatons.  At first I found this movie slow and pointless but about 1/2 way through I got excited to see how it would end.  The ending makes good sense but could have been more detailed.  The movie builds up antisipation and then ends ubruptly and leaves you saying what just happened.  All and all this movie is worth seeing if you enjoy other  Austin movies.
0156027321|5.0|There's been so much hype about The Life Of Pi that it's hard to add anything new. There are a few worthwhile things to say about it though:  - it's has of the most eclectic combinations of topics, themes, ideas  - it's brilliant in its execution in terms of turning a simple survival scenario into a fairly multifaceted one with ideas on religion, individuality and culture  - probably the only book on my shelf that can be read in one day that's NOT in the slightest bit trashy  - Martel's voice in terms of showing an amazing narrator from a non-Western country with all his own individual quirks as well as some broader cultural ones is unparalleled.  - of course the whole truth and suspension of disbelief concepts get a very healthy enjoyable workout

B00005JPPL|3.0|\\"Next\\", the latest cinematic bon-bon from Nicholas Cage, is not a great movie, but it is a pleasant diversion, and suitable bargain matinee material. It's also fun to see Cage's latest bad toupee.<br /><br />Cris (Cage), using the stage name Frank Cadillac, performs cheap tricks in a run down Las Vegas nightclub, under a stage name, to hide his real talent. He is certain that if the government, the `enemy', anyone, discover the nature of this talent, he will lose his freedom and be forced to work for them in order to live. His talent? He can see the future. Granted, he can only see about two minutes into the future, but this is still a valuable skill. There is only one problem. The government already knows he has this power. Callie Farris (Julianne Moore), an FBI agent, has learned that a nuclear bomb missing from the Russian Federation is on its way to America and wants, needs Cris to help them determine when and where it will go off. But Cris has dreams of a beautiful young lady, Liz (Jessica Biel) in a diner and shows up every day, determined to meet her. When Cris finally does meet Liz, he conspires to get her to take him to Flagstaff, because he knows she is headed there. Naturally, Farris and her arsenal of FBI employees are hot on their heels. Oh, and the terrorists, led by Mr. Smith (Thomas Kretschmann, \\"King Kong\\") know about Cris as well and want to stop him, because they know he can foil their plans.<br /><br />\\"Next\\", directed by Lee Tamahori (\\"Once Were Warriors\\", \\"Die Another Day\\") and based on a story by Philip K. Dick (who wrote the story that would become \\"Bladerunner\\"), takes a completely implausible premise (with more than a few plot holes - how do the terrorists know about Cris?) and makes it an enjoyable piece of fluff to help while away a few hours. Actually, scratch that. An enjoyable piece of fluff to while away 100 minutes. This is one of the reasons \\"Next\\" was more enjoyable than I had any right to expect. It was relatively short for a film in this genre, most run two hours or longer, so it kept the action moving.<br /><br />Cris is introduced doing his two-bit magic act at a rundown lounge in a rundown casino in downtown Vegas. He uses a stage name, Frank Cadillac, and gets paid in cash, all in an effort to stay off the radar. To earn extra money, he uses his skill at the tables, earning just enough to make some good cash and not attract any attention. Yet, the casino security people are watching Cris. Even as Cris says he is trying to stay under the radar, he seems to know the casino is watching him. Does he have premonitions as well? He knows that as soon as his ability is revealed, his freedom will be jeopardized, so he tries to stay low key. Naturally, this doesn't work for long. Farris and her assistant are in the audience watching the show. And everyone seems to realize there is a limitation to Cris' ability.<br /><br />This is another of Cage's one-note performances. Throughout the entire film, he seems to be grimacing (in pain? shock?), his face blank and his eyes vacant. But this sort of works for Cris. He is always looking into the future, and these images seem to dull his opinion of the world. Also, he is fairly certain that if his ability is revealed, he will end up in a padded room under observation, so he has to remain fairly low-key.<br /><br />It's sad that the most interesting thing about Cage's performances, lately, is anticipating how bad his toupee will look. In \\"Next\\", he has longer hair, slightly greasy looking, which fits his character well, but still looks exceedingly fake.<br /><br />Because Cris can only see a few minutes into the future, he has fairly limited ability, yet he is able to use this ability to elude pursuers. And this leads to some interesting action scenes. As Cris engages in foot chases or a car chase, he is always able to make the right move, at the right moment, to elude his attackers. This helps to explain his almost `super human' ability to stay out of harm's way. Particularly impressive is how he ducks and weaves, much like a martial arts expert, to elude punches, bullets, falling logs, etc.<br /><br />But this same `two minute rule' leads to the biggest plot hole in the film. Moore's Farris wants Cris' help to locate the stolen nuclear weapon. When Cris finally agrees to help Farris, she plants him in a medical chair in a concrete room wearing glasses that prop his eyes open. Someone wearing a medical jacket puts some drops in his eyes and he can suddenly see further than two minutes into the future. Huh? Actually, in the beginning of the film, he has dreams of Liz (Biel) showing up at a diner at a specific time on a day, yet he doesn't know which day. Clearly, he is already seeing a few days into the future, so this becomes a sloppy plot point, a huge hole in the story. Why is he suddenly able to see further into the future than he was previously? To give the filmmakers more latitude with the story? The filmmakers created this universe; if they needed Cris to be able to see further into the future, make his skills more ambiguous in the first place. Don't simply change the rules after they are established.<br /><br />I think we were supposed to forget about the vision of Liz once Cris has established contact with her. Biel's character then simply becomes a damsel in distress.<br /><br />Julianne Moore is fine, but unexceptional as Farris. Throughout, she remains steely and determined to find the nuclear weapon, no matter what the cost. Because of this, she shows little emotion when some of her team members die in the line of duty. See, she is trying to prevent a bigger loss (millions of innocent people are at risk. Millions!), so the loss of a couple of team members is a small price to pay.<br /><br />Why is Julianne Moore taking roles in films like \\"Next\\"? This is essentially the same type of role she played in \\"Children of Men\\" (a much better film) to lesser effect here. This is the role Alec Baldwin or Danny Glover generally walk through when they are simply collecting a paycheck. Has Moore really been reduced to that? Collecting paychecks? Julianne, hold out for better roles. If you aren't careful one of the television networks will soon be announcing the premiere of your new television series.<br /><br />The one good thing about her character is she trusts Cris' vision and stops when he tells her too, orders her underlings to pay attention to the two-bit magician, and more. She takes his ability seriously and it helps save her life more than once. So often, people second guess the heroes ability repeatedly, despite evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />Jessica Biel continues her quest to perfect the `pretty damsel in distress' role, the type of role where the character becomes little more than a damsel in distress. As the girl in Cris' vision, she is his ideal of the perfect woman. But since we know Cris has seen her, and he can see in the future, he will no doubt do exactly what is required to win her love and admiration, which isn't much. It seems they are in bed together fairly soon after meeting. But of course, this helps to make her a more important pawn in the story; the villains can use her now that Cris has fallen in love with her.<br /><br />Peter Falk even pops up and totters around for a few minutes. What connection his character has to the story is unclear; he seems to be some sort of mentor to Cris' character. But after the action gets going, we never see or here from him again.<br /><br />The best thing about \\"Next\\" is the action sequences and Cris' ability to be able to weave through them without harm. Particularly impressive is a chase down a hillside involving many different items careening down the slope after our heroes and the villains, logs, trucks, boulders. They even manage to throw a huge stagecoach into the mix, sort of like throwing in the kitchen sink for good measure.<br /><br />The ending has an interesting plot twist. On the one hand, it piques my interest. On the other, it almost seems like the filmmakers ran out of money and had to simply end the film. But Tamahori does this with more skill than I am describing. If I went into too much detail, it would spoil it.<br /><br />\\"Next\\" is a better film than I was expecting, and I wasn't expecting much.

B000F7CMRM|1.0|I thought this movie might be good b/c I like most of Matt Damon's movies but I was greatly disappointed.  I had a hard time even finishing the movie.  Save your money or at least rent it before you even think about buying this one.

B000JRYNXE|3.0|I have listened to many albums from artists that have managed to come up with a single hit with other songs included as filler.  Unfortunately, This album falls exactly into this category. <br /> <br />The hit song on the album - \\"The Sweet Escape\\" is far and away one of the best and one of the most popular songs according to the number of downloads for it.  Unfortunately, the other songs on the album are not even close to this masterpiece.  I think Gwen Stefani is very talented, but she should work with very talented song writers (like A. Thiam and G. Tuinfort - the other authors of Sweet Escape).  I give 5+ stars for the Sweet Escape and maybe a generous 2 stars for the other songs... <br /> <br />
B00008BXJJ|5.0|After listening to this album, I wonder why it is not considered as great a live album as it should be. Maybe it's because of the time it was released, but then again, if it were released several years earlier, it wouldn't have the same, great track selection. Anyway, this is a great album to have both for AC/DC fans and newcomers to the band. For newcomers, you get 23, excellent songs derived from every, popular album this band has enjoyed. For AC/DC fans, this can not only prove to be another, great one, but it may introduce you to some songs you might not have been familiar with (for me it was \\"Sin City\\" originally off of \\"Powerage\\", and \\"Who Made Who\\" off the album of the same name, among one or two others.) <br />It's hard to pick favorites, as all songs are great. However, you have the one-two combination of Sin City and Who Made Who, which I found to be a high-voltage delight, plus, a few songs at over ten minutes (High Voltage, Jailbreak and Let There Be Rock, the latter of the three being the best, IMO). There's the epic \\"For Those About To Rock, We Salute You\\", complete with the cannons, the sped-up \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" and beautiful \\"Bonny\\". All of the songs from The Razor's Edge are better here, and the Bon Scott numbers are certainly interesting sung by Brian Johnson. The only thing is that I wish there was enough space to add songs like \\"Have A Drink On Me\\", \\"Shake A Leg\\" (which I would highly anticipate hearing live) or \\"Inject The Venom\\" (released on \\"For Those About To Rock\\"). However, the track selection here is still great and there's a lot to love. <br />This is overall a strong and spirited album with great performances by every member of the band. However, at this point I would like to add that AC/DC's longest running drummer, Phil Rudd, is not on this album, nor The Razor's Edge. I personally prefer him over Chris Slade, as Phil added a bit more of a groove, but both guys prove to be great on the skins. If you want a generous helping of AC/DC,look for this album, among their earlier classics. Rock on!
1579126898|5.0|This was my first Hercule Poirot novel and I found it to be quite a good read. The story follows a wealthy American heiress on her honeymoon. It seems she stole her husband from a good friend of hers and that friend is now stalking the two of them as they travel through Egypt. Before too long, the heiress is murdered and Hercule Poirot is called upon to find the culprit. It turns out that the jilted lover is only the most obvious suspect.  But virtually everyone around them had a motive and Poirot must sift through all the pieces to find his killer.     The characters are interesting and we definitely learn more about them and their motivations as the story unfolds.  Relatively little is what it seems to be on the surface and it is up to the vacationing Poirot to untangle this complex web.  Poirot himself is filled with charm and idiosyncrasies as he goes about his work.  Reading this book, it is very easy to understand his popularity.  The story moves along at a strong pace and is peppered with dialogue that remains witty and charming even after so many decades have passed since this book was written.    Even though my suspicion about the solution to the crime proved to be true, there were more than enough details that I had not worked out that I was still very interested in the reveal at the end.  Based on my enjoyment of \\"Death on the Nile\\" I have already ordered more novels starring the inimitable Poirot and look forward to reading them.
B00005K9LK|5.0|...the first words of the incredible, \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\". Words that everybody can relate to. And, of course, the rest of \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" is just as great. This was one of the first heavy metal CDs I can remember buying, so it makes sense to me at least that I should share with the world my adoration for the classic, the timeless, \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\". <br />Throughout their years, Judas Priest has experimented with progressive metal (which they practically invented with the early classic \\"Victim of Changes\\"), speed metal, power metal, NWOBHM, and guitar-synth hair metal (Turbo was virtually as good as Van Halen at their magnum opus!). It's no wonder that with all of this under their belt, and their seniority (KK Downing and Ian Hill founded Priest in '68 or '69), Judas Priest laid the groundwork for countless heavy metal hopefuls to follow. That, and the fact that the first ever dual-lead guitar factor of KK Downing and Glenn Tipton, along with Rob Halford's marvelous vocals (he's up there with Ozzy Osbourne, Bruce Dickinson and Ronnie James Dio as one of the greatest frontmen in heavy metal), these guys are in a class of their own. <br />Now I will review my favorite tracks of \\"SFV\\". The first, four tracks are great enough as it is, and I'll get to that right now. <br />\\"The Hellion\\": A slow yet powerful introduction with a great riff. It has a kind of progressive energy that gets you ready for an excellent rocker. <br />\\"Electric Eye\\": A speedy, epic tune with a great vocal performance by Rob Halford and some blindingly amazing guitar work by KK and Gleen. The quick change at the bridge shows that progressive-styled music played a role in the band. <br />\\"Riding on the Wind\\": Love the energetic drum opening, followed by a fiery and lush guitar riff, along with Rob Halford's unstoppable falsetto wails. More great guitar soloing and this makes for a great cruising tune. <br />\\"Bloodstone\\": Great followup to \\"Riding on the Wind\\". The opening guitar riff is very New Wave of British Heavy Metal-styled. After that, the second lead guitar comes in and a funk-metal masterpiece is created. Of course, more soaring guitar soloing and Rob Halford's passionate vocal performance. <br />\\"Screaming For Vengeance\\": Very energetic song, with more soaring falsetto wails and a bit of noticeable progressive styling around the three-minute mark. Ends with a drone that goes into... <br />\\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\": The single off the album, which makes for a great, driving song. Rob Halford gives a dramatic, vocal performance and the guitar solo is very inspired. <br /> <br />The rest of the songs are great, too, but like I previously stated, it's worth your money even for the first, four songs. I would probably put this as one of the ten greatest heavy metal albums, IMO. The selection is great and if you want an inspired, wonderfully-crafted and energetic heavy metal album, I'm almost certain you're gonna dig this one.

B00005JPFO|1.0|Want to know precisely what's wrong with Hollywood films? Well, here it is.  Utterly awful story (who 'green-lights' this stuff?), putrid acting, barf-inducing writing, it's all here. Even the special effects have been done better in most any college-level film school. There is only one relatively cool shot in the film and that is the sight of Ghost Rider's motorcycle and Sam Elliott's horse riding side-by-side through the desert while in flames. And where does this scene go? They stop, utter a few more mind-numbing lines and Sam Elliott rides off into the desert, presumably to go cash his paycheck. This is the first film in memory that had me actually checking the customer seating for an easy escape from the cineplex. Actually, now that I think about it, the \\"actors\\" deserve 1 star for keeping a straight face while mumbling through their nonsensical lines. To sum up; there is not one shred of anything new here and Nicolas Cage and Sam Elliott should be thoroughly embarrassed. I sure was. This is garbage and it's not even fun, stylish garbage.
B000035P5E|5.0|1981's \\"Eye of the Needle,\\" a canny World War II spy drama, is another of the good romantic thrillers made in the 80's.  It's based on a novel by Ken Follett, with screenplay by Stanley Mann.  It stars the Canadians Kate Nelligan and Donald Sutherland, at the head of an excellent British cast; and it boasts a stunning musical score by Miklos Rosza, his last, that undoubtedly contributes to the film's moods.  It was made on location in London and Scotland, features quite beautiful cinematography by Alan Hulme, and was ably directed by Richard Marquand.<br /><br />The film opens at a critical point in the ongoing war.  It deals with the so-called \\"Henry Faber,\\" important German spy dubbed \\"The Needle\\" at home for his favorite way of despatching people, by stiletto (Sutherland).  We find him in place in a railway yard, a useful place for him to be, until Hitler personally assigns him to double check the impending Allied plans to invade mainland Europe.  This assignment will bring him eventually to isolated Storm Island, off Scotland's coast, where he will meet David, legless former air pilot (Christopher Cazenove), and his unhappy wife Lucy (Nelligan).  It quickly becomes a romantic triangle.  The affair between Sutherland and Nelligan is a mature, passionate, sexy one: the film has placed Sutherland's age at 40, and Nelligan has been given a son.<br /><br />Sutherland gives a creepily forceful performance as The Needle, although his accent sometimes wavers.  Nelligan gives one of her trademark big, intense performances: it seems to me she was once tipped as Hollywood's next big female star, and it never happened, for reasons unknown to me.  But she really carries this picture.  Cazenove is surprisingly good as the embittered former flyboy.  Ian Banner turns in his usual fine performance as chief spy sweeper.  Rupert Fraser makes the most of his one scene as Muller.  And, in a very small part at the end, we see Bill Nighy, who has suddenly, recently, become a star at an age when a lot of burnt-out stars are selling real estate.<br /><br />When you think of it though, The Needle and Lucy must inevitably clash; just the two of them on the tiny island.  Mind you, patriotism's all very well, but I consider this film more a good illustration of the age-old fact that women are more fixed in place than are men.  The Needle, as a spy, is, by definition, a long way from home.  But Lucy owns a farm, and has a son who will someday expect to inherit.  She doesn't have the option of, say, running off to Germany with Faber.  In fact, this exact same situation underlies the Harrison Ford-Kelly McGillis relationship in the powerful romantic thriller \\"Witness,\\" also from the 80's.<br /><br />So, as the knockout ending unspools, The Needle tells Lucy, \\"The War has come down to the two of us... I did what I had to do, it cannot be undone. I'm sorry.\\"  But if you enjoy a rich romantic suspense movie, you won't be.of burnt-out stars are selling real estate.

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Yes I did recently jump on the MCR album for about a month now ever since I discovered the song Dead through GH2 on XBOX 360 and thought hey thats not a bad song and also hearing Welcome to the Black Parade on the radio one time or another but did not pay attention until until I downloaded the whole album and I gotta say it was definately worth it!  Now I typically don't listen to this \\"emo\\" genre but MCR are exceptional.  I always thought the singer in MCR always screamed in every song but not on this album he can actually carry a tune they remind me of Green Day, Sum 41 and Avenged Sevenfold mixed.  I mostly listen to alt, metal, and classic rock and this cd has it all in one bag.  I also like the fact that it is a concept album and thats always a plus.  Most the songs on The Black Parade are flat out rockers except a few soft songs like I Don't Love You, Disenchanted, Mama and Cancer but thats not a bad thing.  and the energetic songs like Welcome to the Black Parade, Dead, This Is How I Disappear and Famous last Words this cd has something for everyone.  So if you're nervous about checking the band out give this cd a try and you may like it or you may hate it if you liked American Idiot you will most likely like this record I will definately catch MCR on the project revolution tour with Linkin Park.

B000002UCN|4.0|I've always liked George Harrison. He was a great Beatle, who was underrated in the musical department. This collection has all of his Beatle best, and \\"Something\\" is simply amazing. One of my favorite songs ever. This collection in lean on the solo work, and only has the Beatle stuff. Everyone is pining for a \\"George Harrison Anthology\\" and i am rooting for it to be released. He made a lot of great stuff post-Beatles; and his music still influences today. George, you were a saint.

B00005J6SZ|3.0|Even knowing transformation is one of Madonna's characteristics and strengths, retrospectively, her second album Like A Virgin is perplexing: Was this just a means for climbing up the chart or was this really what she was? In cheesily deformed Chic-like disco tunes by producer Nile Rodgers, Madonna doesn't appear to be genuine. Still, there are moments we take a glimpse of bona fide Madonna--in her own love song \\"Angel,\\" for example, sparkling between exceedingly chart-aimed \\"Material Girl\\" and \\"Like A Virgin.\\"
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I saw this lovely young woman sing \\"Like a Star\\" one night on Jay Leno's Tonight Show and, besides the beauty of the song and her singing, I was captivated by her smile as she sang. I ordered this CD. On the day it arrived, I played it several times, the title song burrowing its way into my subconscious. That night I watched \\"Medium\\" on TV. It was a repeat of an episode I'd already seen and, to my surprise, this recording of \\"Like a Star\\" was repeated over and over as the complete hour's soundtrack--not continuously, but in snatches the way the song itself appears and reappears in my mind's ear. I had obviously heard the track the first time I'd seen the episode and its subtle beauty had wormed its way into my unconscious. To my surprise and gratification, the other tracks on the CD stand up strongly on their own.  It's so refreshing to find a singer whose smile is audible!
B000N3ST7A|5.0|.....If he did, he'd help me get better seats to your concerts! Buy the CD/DVD package from Amazon. There is something so genuine about Stevie Nicks and her music. Her commentary on the videos alone is worth the price. Check out her commentary on Edge Of Seventeen! The videos are awesome. The vocals on this CD send chills down my spine. Her voice is strong and incredible. The greatest female rock performer in my lifetime has just delivered a CD/DVD package to die for. By the way, did I mention you should buy it right away? Do so, you won't regret it. (I know she is your hero too).

GREAT!
B000O75F7C|4.0|I hear elements of the Porcupine Tree sound continued from Deadwing to this new album.  Deadwing was an album that had to grow on me, but once I listened to it a few times I was hooked.  This album appears to be the same in that regard.  I do like the use of mellotron throughout this album...it adds a nice touch.  There is a harder edge to a lot of the music on this album too.  I am also happy to hear the guest solos from Alex Lifeson of Rush and Robert Fripp of King Crimson, which are both favorites of mine.  I think that overall PT fans will be happy, but I have seen a number of negative comments/reviews from PT fans that criticize this album for being simple and a departure from the sounds of In Absentia and Stupid Dream...I would agree that this album is more along the lines of Deadwing for overall sound.  I am enjoying this new album as the latest from Porcupine Tree, which is growing on me but maybe not as fast as Deadwing did...<br /><br />NEW INFO...I saw PT live in concert this last weekend.  They did all of the songs from Fear of a Blank Planet.  It was amazing.  These songs all sounded wonderful live.  The band was spot on with their playing.  I have been listening to the CD more now too.  This album has definitely grown on me, and I will be listening to it a lot.  The videos that accompanied the music added another dimension to the message of the album.  It was fanastic!  The opening act was Three or 3 as listed on the CD.  PT fans seemed to be impressed with them...so check them out too!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Bob Dylan for the last few years has been one of the most exiting artists rock has to offer. He has written a best selling book, toured extensively, and recorded two highly regarded albums, putting him in a late career renaissance     Starting with 2001's effort, LOVE AND THEFT, and now this album, MODERN TIMES, Bob Dylan has newly occupied musical territory. Dylan has broken new ground with both these releases. Nothing in post-millennium rock sounds anything like these two records, and for good reason. Bob Dylan has turned back the clock to pre-rock and roll, and recorded some of the most exiting music of his career, focusing solely on American traditional music.     Dylan came into critical acclaim with the 1997 album, TIME OUT OF MIND. His first album of original songs in seven years, TOOM won best album of the year at the Grammies, and the first of three critically acclaimed albums. MT has been marketed as the end of this \\"trilogy,\\" but Dylan disagrees with that assessment. TOOM, great album that it is, sounds totally separate from L&T and MT and is an album unto itself, totally separate from the music found on the next two releases. Dylan said MT would be the second part of a trilogy, if there is going to be one, with L&T being the first part.     When LOVE AND THEFT was released, Dylan impressed the critics and the fans a second time in a row. L&T is a markedly different album than its predecessor, TIME OUT OF MIND, which is a much darker, aesthetically different album. MODERN TIMES is very much a companion album to L&T, and proves the methodology behind his 2001 effort was not a one off fluke. Dylan does a wide variety of traditional music on MT, from blues to ballads to crackerjack rock and roll to apocalyptic visions of oncoming doom.     Song for song, MT is as strong and L&T, with a few casual masterpieces. \\"Working Man's Blues #2\\" is fantastic, some great lines. \\"Ain't Talkin'\\", MT's last song, is not only the best song from album, but also one of Dylan's greatest songs of the last 25 years, easily the equal of any of his 1960s output and a lyrical tour-de-force, the newest of his great story, apocalyptic story songs.     Dylan largely writes from the perspective of one who has seen it all, but keeps on trucking (like the narrator from \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\").     Both records have been tremendously successful. MODERN TIMES went to number one on the billboard charts, Dylan's first since the 1976 album DESIRE. Dylan is the oldest person (65 at the time), to have a number one album on the charts. \\"Someday Baby\\" won a Grammy.     MT is largely a further exploration of Americana. Just like its predecessor, MT is squarely rooted in pre-rock music. Like L&T, MT sounds fresh, startling, and deeply relevant due to it being so firmly rooted in American traditional music. There is no other musician today who makes these traditional forms so wonderfully alive, and yet so in sync with his or her own unique and musical vision as Bob Dylan does, while still making them so accessible to today's public.     Both titles are a clue to what the album is about. L&T is Dylan's love for prerock music, and his ransacking of the forms (a sly reference to the folk tradition). MODERN TIMES, is rather ironic, as there is nothing modern about the music itself, but the title also acknowledges, in a post modern sort of way, that the album is recorded and presented in modern times for modern audiences, and a knowing reference to Charlie Chaplan's film.     Also, Dylan has gone on interviews saying this is the best band, man for man, that he's had, which is saying a lot, as he was backed by so many great bands. Dylan's also made several comments about how compressed the sounds are on modern records, something he had tried to stay away from.     Where L&T used early 20th musical structures and genres, Dylan wrote all the music and lyrics. With MT, however, Dylan has turned too T. S. Eliot for advice, who famously said \\"Bad poets imitate. Good poetssteal.\\" Working within what is known as the \\"folk tradition\\", Dylan has taken several songs from his encyclopedic knowledge of traditional music, updated either the music or the lyrics or both, and then presented the material as his own. He has also used a few select lines from Henry Timrod, the Civil War poet. Both the songs and Timrod are now in public domain, so the sources are not a legal issue. Regardless, All this has caused some controversy.     First, it should be known that before copyright laws and intellectual property rights became one of the abiding legal preoccupations of the 20th and 21st century, musicians and performers largely worked within the context of an oral and written tradition, freely adapting and changing often well known material and presenting it as original work. This goes far beyond just music as well. This process, known within musical history as the folk tradition, has been going on in American traditional music for decades, and has also been part of rock's long and varied history as well.     However, with the entrance of rock, matters get complicated. Intellectual property rights in the past forty to fifty years have become major legal issues. Now, music is copyrighted and royalties get paid. Songwriting credits determine who get paid. Those who wrote original music want to get paid when that music is used. While most of MT's music is modeled after other artists' songs, the credits read \\"All songs written by Bob Dylan\\".     Led Zeppelin is also famous for this type of adaptation, and was even sued by Willie Dixon in 1970 for the use of lyrics in their song \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" without him being credited. Dixon won the lawsuit.     Bob Dylan has done this type of adaptation and musical pilfering from the very start of his career. One of his very first original songs to be published, \\"Song to Woody\\", used the melody of Guthrie's own \\"1913 Massacre\\". There are numerous other instances of this type of artistic pilfering in Dylan's musicwhich for reasons of space I will not go into. A book or scholarly paper is better suited to more fully analyses and explore this element in Dylan's music, not a review on a website. For those curious, I include at the end of this review more info about the MT's sources.     While from a business and artistic standpoint, this adaptation and borrowing, yet not crediting the source, is rather alarming to modern audiences, it's my belief that that has what made MT and L&T resonate so well. There is something in both records that simply strike a chord with listeners. Dylan has always been about traditional music, and while he ventured out to record different varieties of music, the American traditional songbook has always been in the back of Dylan's mind.     What has made MT and L&T so successful is they feel like an aural history of American music before 1950. Of all the major rock artists of the modern era, Dylan is the most versed in the rich American traditions. American traditional music have always been the bedrock of his muse, and with L&T and MT Dylan wisely makes that the central focus of his work. This music sounds like a time capsule, music made by an American for Americans before the advent of rock and roll. Dylan is the most qualified of all our major rock artists to make music with this timeless, traditional feel.     Due to his own unique position in rock history, no other major musician other than Dylan has released an album with all the rich history of Americana so inherently woven in the fabric of his new music. In all likelihood, no other artist probably could. Dylan cut his teeth on traditional music, and he is the most able to make that music relevant again to modern audiences.     Bottom line: fantastic album. Must buy.                           Appendix - Sources for MODERN TIMES songs:   *\\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" is an update on Chuck Berry's \\"Johnny B. Good'. *\\"Rolling and Tumbling\\" is a blues standard, recorded by everyone from Cream, CannedHeat, Robert Johnson, and Eric Clapton. Muddy Waters' version is the most famous. There are over sixty recorded versions of this song.   *\\"When the Deal Goes Down\\" uses the melody from Bing Crosby's signature song \\"When the Blue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day\\".   *\\"Someday Baby\\" is based off a Muddy Waters song called \\"Trouble No More\\".   * \\"Beyond the Horizon\\" lifts the entire structure and melody of \\"Red Sails in the Sunset\\", written by Jimmy Kennedy and Hugh Williams in 1935.   *\\"Nettie Moore\\" lifts the title and some of its chorus though Dylan's melody and lyrics are otherwise unrecognizable.   *\\"The Levees Gonna Break\\" is a based on the blues standard \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" by Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie. Led Zeppelin reworked the song as well into their own composition, much different from Dylan's.   *\\"Aint Talkin\\" derives its chorus from the more up-tempo \\"Highway of Regret\\" by the Stanley Brothers
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I am a huge Michael Buble fan and seriously wondered if this cd would be a simple retread, safely copying his succesful formula of mixing the classics with the contemporary.<br /><br />All fears be gone.  Yes, he uses the same formula but he flies and soars above all his past recordings. Let me start by saying I have had the awesome pleasure of seeing Michael live in concert and he is dynamic, passionate a true gifted performer.<br /><br />This cd is the first that puts out that passion and intensity thru studio recordings.  An amazing feat.  The classics are made fresh and new.  There is not a mis-step here.  There are many contemporary numbers and I find they all blend together perfectly. I never say - oh, here is an old one.<br /><br />There are many standouts for me - ME AND MRS. JONES, I'M YOUR MAN, LOST EVERYTHING and an amazing modern interpretation of THAT'S LIFE.<br /><br />I just find this cd amazing.  The ballads are more intense, the fast numbers more joyful, the band more exuberant.  There are so many singers today who sing the classics but Michael Buble has finally grown to the position of not needing to be compared to any other singer ever again.<br /><br />He has come into his own.  He is Michael Buble and now they will need to start comparing singers to him.  I love music and when a true artist reaches their prime, it is amazing to hear.  That is what this is.<br /><br />As for the lisp, yes he has a slight one but I dis that reviewer who mocked him so strongly.  Michael Buble just stated in an interview how his recording sessions are nerve racking. He uses no filters, etc. It is purely his voice, raw and real - totally natural.  If his vocal style has developed to have the slight lisp it only adds a distinction to his style in my opinion.<br /><br />This one should get him his long overdue Grammy.
B000BCE7QU|5.0|I have all of Prefab Sprout music. All the albums, all the b-sides, all the rarities. All? Well, not quite. Like you I'm missing these albums that are somewhere in Paddy McAloon's head: \\"Earth, the story so far\\", the musical about Zorro, etc. All this stuff that fuels fan forums discussions and which will probably never see the light of the day, because Paddy McAloon could not produce them the way he wanted. <br /> <br />But maybe it's better this way. Just think about it: \\"Steve McQueen\\", \\"From Langley Park to Memphis\\", \\"Jordan: the comeback\\" and the underrated \\"Andromeda Heights\\". 4 albums, 4 gems. Isn't this enough? After these, \\"The Gunman\\" was not as good and \\"I trawl the Megahertz\\" definitely doesn't belong to the Prefab Sprout history. <br /> <br />I have all of Prefab Sprout music yet I bought this new edition of \\"Steve McQueen\\". Because it sounds like never before, and because these 8 acoustic tracks are actually far more than an unplugged session. <br /> <br />So the world doesn't need a new Prefab Sprout record. The world just needs to (re) discover the best pop album ever produced: \\"Steve McQueen\\", by Prefab Sprout. 1985.
B000MZHW4A|4.0|I lived with my family in Sierra Leone for 8 years and we were evacuated twice because of the war.   <br />When the movie first came out in theater's I wasn't sure what to think. In telling the story of a country, there's a fine line between making it enjoyable for the person watching, and also making it realistic and accurate -- but after seeing it, I am happy to say that this movie measures up to both. I will admit that at first I did not want to watch the movie -- after all, that was my home.  <br />It took me a very long time to build up enough courage to watch the movie, and when I did watch it, it was very difficult.  <br />Like I said before, it was very accurate. I caught one minor mistake in the African language, and the only thing that I saw that wasn't real was the cheetah (there are no cheetahs in Sierra Leone), but other than that, I can not complain about the accuracy of the movie -- they did a very good job of making it.  <br />They especially did a great job of portraying the nature and intentions of the RUF rebels, and their use of child soldiers, as well as the struggle that families had in staying together.  <br />As far as the violence in concerned, I really expected this movie to be more graphic. Amputations and other forms of torture were a very big part of this war but they were only brought up a couple times in the movie, and very briefly. But I realize that the producers wanted to make the movie in a way that people would want to watch it.  <br />The attack on the capital city really surprised me -- it was so much like the real one that I wondered how they were able to do it, until I found out that an African journalist had helped them recreate it. <br />This journalist had been in the capital city at the time of the attack, and in his effort to reach the rest of the world with the desperation of Sierra Leone's war, he actually stood there and videoed the attack, and sent his video footage (\\"Cry Freetown\\") to other countries.  <br />This same journalist assisted in the making of the movie \\"Blood Diamond\\" which accounts for the amazing accuracy.  <br />Of course, the main characters in the movie are fictitious, and the plot is made up, but the war and the events that took place in the movie, they are all real.  <br />So many people in Sierra Leone have struggled, and their stories do not all have a happy ending, but for the sake of viewer this movie did.  <br />

B000NVIXFK|4.0|I am an old Rush fan so I must be real. It does not matter how good a new Rush CD is, as long as it does not resemble anything before Signals I will naturally be disappointed in that respect. But I have to stop letting that particular disappointment get in the way of enjoying current Rush music. So I will and did. This CD has to be the best since Signals just on the instumentals alone. Once one gets beyond Geddy's overdubbing of vocals, the music really is fresh and inspiring. We Hold On is a darn good tune and very worthy or radio play. Working them Angels and Spindrift are highlights. As an old Rush fan, I have to at least be satisfied that Snakes and Arrows is the best since Signals and makes me forget of the bad Test for Echo.
0743496728|5.0|I am an avid Jodi Picoult fan, and this book takes the cake for the best.  Not only am I an [...] English teacher, I'm also a mother of an [...] so the basic premise was very appealing to me escpecially after the VT massacre.     This book made me question myself and my own judgemental behavior.  So many have been saying the Picoult overdid it with the stereotypical characters, but I don't think that is the main point of the book.  I wanted to soak in every word in every sentence. The words seemed to resonate with familiarity.  Picoult did an amazing job at making the reader empathize with the main character, Peter, but for the victims of the shooting, too.  I was on both sides of the fence while reading the story, and I think that's the point that Picoult is trying to make throughout the story.  As humans, we are too quick to judge and make rash decisions.  Picoult also intertwines multiple themes such as gun control, violence in video games, abusive relationships, etc, into a point where you're not sure where you stand on the issue.  Her point exactly! It was simply genius.  An absolute must-read!
B000MGUZM0|4.0|I guess I'm getting old.  I haven't heard any real music being produced in a very long time.   <br /> <br />We live now in a world of hip gangsters and fall out boys and pretty metallica impersonators (not that metallica was even worthy of impersonating) and I honest to God was growing convinced that all of the artists out there had laid down their instruments and gone to work for Haliburton in Iraq (hey it pays good, right?). <br /> <br />Then along comes this album with its amazing arrangements and a passionate writer with a voice like Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young's lovechild (gross visual, eh?)...and now my whole world has been thrown into question.   <br /> <br />And what's that?  They even appear to have moral objections and spiritual convictions?  <br /> <br />Is music alive?  Where's it been hiding? <br /> <br />Top this off by another Modest Mouse album...and I'm seeing blue skies after the rain. <br /> <br />Check out: <br />\\"No Cars Go\\" <br />\\"Antichrist Television Blues\\" <br />\\"Intervention\\" <br /> <br /> <br />
B000GIXIBY|4.0|Probably the best video transfer we will ever see of Army of Darkness, the lack of any extra material is disappointing, but will probably be rectified with the usual Special or Collectors re-releases they seem to pump out constantly.  <br /> <br />Evil Dead/Campbell fans would have already made their mind whether to get this release or not so I will say two things:  <br />Hardcore fans will love the extra quality it offers, casual fans will be disappointed by the lack of features and slightly lacking image quality (may have to do with source material rather than lacking effort)
0156027321|5.0|Who would've thought that a book with such a strange plot would feel so real! It sounds simple enough - a boy surviving on a boat with a tiger. But there is so much symbolism to be found if you look deep enough. I also thought that it was pretty funny at times, but that's probably only because I have a gruesome sense of humor... <br /> <br />There's not much else I can say that hasn't already been said. Definitely worth reading.
B000001FDQ|5.0|When this record came out I am proud to say I already knew two things.  1. Who Yngwie Malmsteen was.  2. How to pronounce his name - at least I think I knew that - all because of the mid 80's radio show \\"Metal Shop\\".  Rising Force is one of those albums that I am glad I am reviewing 20 + years later than right after I bought it.  Mainly because my opinion has changed very little.  This was killer back then and it remains so to this day.  I never cared much for the two tracks with vocals but the instrumentals are phenomenal.  This record is everything that was good about 80's metal - it is a fine example of the self-indulgence guitar style of the era but with remarkable musicianship.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I double-dog dare you to watch the wedding scene in this movie without shedding a few tears. It's one of the most beautiful scenes in cinematic history. This movie is first rate and first class; the cinematography, the scenery, the music, the sound, the singing, the acting, is all remarkable and extraordinary.<br /><br />When Maria is struggling with her own doubts, fears and inadequacies and trying to discern God's will for her life, Reverend Mother tells her, \\"The love of a man and woman is holy, too. Maria, you have a great capacity for love. What you must find out is how God wants you to spend that love. If you love this man, it doesn't mean that you love God less.\\"<br /><br />I was so inspired by that idea, that I wrote it down and kept it in my heart for many days. \\"The Sound of Music\\" is a wonderful, classic movie and I love the history that's blended into the story as well.<br /><br />Just fantastic. Wish Hollywood would produce a contemporary movie that could measure up to the shirtwaist of The Sound of Music.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|This astounding album is so massive in scale and depth that one cannot possibly listen just 1 time and write an adequate review. Throughout the near constant onslaught of layered guitars, legato space-filling bass, and crackling drums there is a darker more serious mood expressed by the darkest lyrical content Peart has yet produced. Don't be turned off at first about this observation- it is honestly the most sincere and well-written humanistic lyrical content I've ever heard. It's just that it seems the current political mood and Peart's personal experiences coalesce in this one album and meet to produce a darker, almost angry theme. But it is the astounding musical production and towering arrangements that make this for me the best album since Power Windows, and perhaps even since Moving Pictures. The sheer depth, power, and variation of musical styles on display makes the current-one-hit wonder band dominant scene as puny and irrelevant as it truly is. For Rush-haters, the usual complaints remain- Lee's voice, Peart's active drums, Lifeson's layers upon layers, etc. But no one- I mean NO ONE can listen to this album and say these three guys (plus young hot producer Nick Raskulinecz) didn't put everything they had down on tape (or hard drive as the case may be).
B000G75AE8|3.0|\\"Christ Illusion\\", Slayer's latest album after a five year wait, is an album that shows that Slayer still has its edge that gave them respect over the 1980's by fellow metal fans, but it's not an album that will completely have you pleased. If you disliked their albums \\"Diabolus In Musica\\" and \\"God Hates Us All\\" (I thought those albums were decent at best), you'll probably dislike this one too. Even with the original lineup featuring Dave Lombardo on drums, they still retain their newer sound, even if they do try to write another \\"Reign In Blood\\". Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman can sure shred and play fast, and they make some impressive solos. Only flaw is that at least some variety could be used while playing your impressive dual guitar. Lombardo still proves to be an excellent drummer after his absence from the band. However, the biggest factor that drags this album down is Tom Araya's vocals. I never found him to be an excellent vocalist; his voice just sounds raspy and headache inducing. The lyrics are pretty dumb, and while I usually am not a purist when it comes to lyrical subjects, Slayer just makes me want to think the opposite. \\"Cult\\" is the perfect example: it's just another dumb anti-religion rant. Oh yeah, don't forget the 666!<br /><br />This album isn't the greatest thing to come out, nor is it the biggest abomination to set itself on the record shelves (leave that to [[ASIN:B00008OWZG St. Anguish]] and [[ASIN:B000HXDEUI The Metallica Wannabe Crusade]]). It has its up and it has its downs. If you're a big fan of Slayer and modern metal, enjoy. If you're looking for music with more depth and diversity, you might want to look elsewhere.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Drugs kill, and the death is not only physical. They kill focus, they kill the wish to live, they kill the humanity of attitude but most damningly they kill hopes and dreams. Ironically enough, the lead characters of Requiem for a Dream are drawn to drugs seeking a short cut to a life which is beyond them but which they yearn for. Eventually this very short cut paves the way for their downfall.<br /><br />An old lady's dream to be on TV, a young man's urge to be rich and happy, his friend and girl friend's need to tag along while aspiring to live a rich life - all these dreams die an untimely death. However, the audience is not subjected to any drama. The narrative is evenly paced, and realistic with some exceptional cinematography making the viewing experience a delight. The end is tragic, realistic, and painful but every bit true. Conforming reality to art is as much a challenge as conforming art to reality and on both counts this movie comes out on top.<br /><br />A must watch movie for the young aspiring generation regardless of which air they breathe in.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|For those drooling for a return to Rush's glory days, for their sound and approach in such albums as \\"2112,\\" \\"Hemispheres,\\" and \\"Permanent Waves,\\" I can offer partial relief.  Extended sections of their new album do indeed recall many of the tracks on those albums.  There are times, especially in the instrumentals, when you could convince an unsuspecting Rush fan that he was listening to alternative takes of \\"YYZ\\" or \\"Natural Science.\\"<br /><br />So, at least for a classic Rush fan such as me, this is certainly a boon.<br /><br />But I'd like to clarify a few things.  Geddy Lee -- bless his heart -- is now 56 and simply incapable of hitting those banshee wails of yesteryear:  \\"Spinning, whirling, still descending / Like a spiral sea unending,\\" and \\"Each of us / A cell of awareness.\\"  No, those days are gone, gone, gone.<br /><br />Which means that any future music has to be written around this problem, meaning that the majority of the songs on \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" lack the range, complexity, and register of previous Rush outings.  To tell you the truth, many of the songs here could be interchanged with offerings from any of their most recent albums.<br /><br />There are other ways that Rush has changed, too.  One of the things that I miss most achingly is that they brought out true concept albums, where one entire side of an album was an extended exploration of a single dedicated theme.  This, also, has not returned since \\"Hemispheres.\\"<br /><br />But most grievous to me is this:  when I was younger, I was into stuff like science fiction and Dungeons and Dragons.  Hence I really got into a groove with Rush's lyrics, since many of them told tales of daring spacepilots, baleful necromancers, future dystopias, Rivendell, the Greek gods, etc.<br /><br />They were rock ballads.  They told a story.  And these kind of lyrics haven't been seen since about \\"Permanent Waves,\\" and show no signs of coming back.<br /><br />Not that Peart's lyrics these days aren't thoughtful or anything.  But I realize now in the fullness of age that one of the things that drew me to Rush in my younger years wasn't just their music or virtuosity, but the fact that their lyrics unabashedly entered worlds of fantasy or alternate reality, and this provided a fitting soundtrack to the concerns of my geeky intellect at the time.<br /><br />Instead, the lyrics on \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" are merely a continuation of Peart's bete noire for the last decade or so:  that the world is fundamentally out of whack, accompanied by vague prescriptions for returning to a world of spirit and feeling.  I'm sure you know the kind of didactic, syrupy stuff I'm talking about:  \\"Sometimes the need is just too great / For the solace that we seek,\\" \\"Some things can never be changed,\\" \\"What am I supposed to say,\\" \\"We can only grow the way the wind blows.\\"  You get the idea.<br /><br />In other news, I don't believe Peart's drumming and Lifeson's fretwork can be cause for complaint.<br /><br />So in conclusion, a mixed bag.  I certainly welcome the turnabout in sound and rhythm that Rush has evidently embraced, but this honey drip of yesteryear, in a way, only leaves me longing for other aspects of their former greatness that the band has shown no indication of wanting to rekindle.t one of the things that drew me to Rush in my younger years wasn't just their music or virtuosity, but the fact that their lyrics unabashedly entered worlds of fantasy or alternate reality, and this provided a fitting soundtrack to the concerns of my geeky intellect at the time.

038560310X|4.0|Wow. Literally just finished this two minutes ago. Impressed that while everything is so cram-packed into it (psychology, philosophy, horror, supernatural, drugs, sex, you name it...not to mention that there are actually 2+ separate stories going on here), it is still lucid and accessible.  <br />Something of this length usually takes me about a week to get through, but i started this last night. It moves at a rapid pace, and i disagree with other reviewers who were hindered by the footnotes and odd formatting--those novelties just pull it all right along.  <br /> <br />The back of my copy has a review that comparing this to Thomas Pynchon. I read Gravity's Rainbow about a month ago and i see absolutely no similarities. Each has its own merits, and i can't say which i like better because it really is comparing apples to oranges. Pynchon's work seems more intellectual but maybe that's because i didn't understand all of it (yeah, you try it, buddy) and his depth seems oxymoronically to approach the vague. House of Leaves is, as i've said, quite accessible and rapid-paced, but sometimes the intellect therein seems a pretentious facade, like when you realize that many of the cited sources are fakes.  <br /> <br />What is put together here reminds me a lot of the first novels, circa 1700s, by Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding, Swift, and Defoe. The idea of a story within a story to promote verisimilitude seems novel here but has been used in literature for hundreds of years.  Including letters in a novel was popular at the beginning of the genre (reading those from Johnny's deranged and institutionalized mother in Appendix II E is a must), and unusual format or pictures within the text can be found in Sterne's \\"Tristram Shandy\\" (though admittedly not as abundant as in H.O.L). Thus while many readers are drawn to H.O.L. for its \\"wacky\\" aesthetic, it is not so original as to be \\"like no other novel you've ever read\\" (Newsweek). <br />So, while there is nothing new under theSun....Danielewski's (or Zampano's?) work is nonetheless a remarkable foray into the theme of Dark, both within The Navidson Record and in the life of the \\"narrator(s)\\" as well.
B00005JPAO|3.0|I don't see The Queen enough from my part of the world to truely judge whether Ms. Mirren nailed her performance.  I believed her-her style came off as natural and not 'look-at-me-I'm-acting'.  The actor portraying Prince Charles came off as a mimic to me.  As for the movie's content and it's overall entertainment value, I agree with the reviewer in this felt more like something you'd watch on A & E's Biography or Public TV.  I was fine paying three bucks for a rental than the double digits one would pay at the theater.  Take a peek and judge for yourself-I just suggest you go the rental route like I did.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I eagerly awaited this album and was more excited about this release than that of any other album, ever (granted, I'm not that old...). I am extremely satisfied with the final product, despite some gripes here and there. Going through each track: <br /> <br />Fear of a Blank Planet is a terrific opener which is essentially perfect. Reminds me of the title track from Deadwing, it's about as good. The metalness is not overblown, Gavin is really good at drums, the production is epic and flawless, and the mellow ending is obviously the best part, by far. Someone wrote a review earlier that said that ending should have been edited, which I found laughable. Such impatient listeners! Perhaps Wilson has something to say about that... <br /> <br />My Ashes is definitely the best song on the album, though not my favorite. It is 100 percent perfect, I would not change a thing. The lyrics are haunting and not trite, which can't be said about any of the other tracks. There are no awkward or wasted seconds, and the strings are a perfect touch. This has been in and out of my top 5 PT songs in the last couple weeks. <br /> <br />Anesthetize. Wow. Certainly the most compelling track in recent memory, this song is absolutely amazing. Every part is captivating, I don't think any second is wasted, which says a lot considering it's an 18 minute piece. The riff at about 5 minutes, after the Lifeson solo and before the heaviness, is mind-blowingly cool, I just wish it had gone on longer or they came back to it. The lyrics in this song are the only problem I have with it, they seem quite uninspired and I don't much like the melody in the verse. Chorus is amazing though, as everyone has said. Oh, I think Gavin might be kinda good at drums too. <br /> <br />I'm a little ambivalent about Sentimental, the follower. It has an awesome, creative drum beat, as expected from my boy, and the chorus is definitely beautiful. The verse is pretty good, definitely like the melody but not really the words. Steven definitely didn't put his best foot forward with the lyrical content in this album, as much as I wanna believe otherwise. The Trains section at the end is really weird and I still don't get it. I assume it was intentional, but if it was I don't really see the point. I don't like the guitar solo either, there's a really weird B flat that does not belong and it hurts me every time I hear it.  <br /> <br />Way Out of Here has a bunch of awesome musical ideas and I also really like the words. The only gripe I have is the arrangement of the song, I could have used another heavy verse. I really like the metal part and the contrasts and everything, and the ending is definitely inspired. Love the bass line too throughout the song.  <br /> <br />Sleep Together. My goodness, this song is spectacular. That same reviewer said that it should be left off the album? Dude, are you kidding?? This is PT's best closer since Dark Matter, and it's probably even better than that. It's got the sickest groove and riff, middle section, ending, chorus, drum tone, synth ostinato...I have nothing bad to say about this song, it's absolutely amazing.  <br /> <br />Here are the songs in order of goodness: My Ashes, Sleep, Anesthetize, Fear, Way out, Sentimental. <br /> <br />In order of goodness to listen to: Anesthetize, Sleep, Ashes, Fear, Way out, Sentimental. <br /> <br />Warfield, next Friday. Needless to say, I'm excited.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|The only thing that makes this listenable is the production and of course, the drums.     Geddy Lee seems to be unconcerned with creating solid, tight, memorable melodies. Peart's lyrics are painful to listen to. The lyrics are strained, the metaphors are awkward and they try to shove way too much information down our throats.     What happened to building around and focusing on powerful lines like \\"Anything can happen\\" from Prime Mover? Or \\"I'll be around, if you don't let me down\\" from Cold Fire? Or even as recently as Vapor Trails - \\"You can never break the chain/there is never love without pain\\"? This album lacks a lot of inspiration, craftwork, or subtlety for that matter, things I love about music and that I've loved about Rush in the past. \\"We will pay the price, but we will not count the cost.\\" Really, the problem is in the uninspired melodies and hammer-over-your-head lyrics.    And while I'm complaining, let's not leave Lifeson out of this. You never nix keyboards out of principle - you wipe away a huge sound palette to paint with. His choice to do so has made the songs sound too much the same.    I'll listen to it plenty, because nobody kills and fills on the drums like Neil Peart. But after 3 complete listens, I don't have even an ounce of the usual Rush bug.
0060930349|5.0|This is a great book and the other reviewers who give it a tumbs up do a great job of explaining why, so there is little I can add.  Johnson does a wonderful job wrapping together over 400 years of history into a one book which is no small thing.  Its easy to read and grasp and almost 'see' history happening in the book.  This is a must read history book if you want to learn about America.
B00005JPFH|3.0|spiderman 3 is serviceable entertainment.  we all know the story(ies) involved and for the most part they tie up loose ends.  acting, plot and special effects are all well done.  so, why the lower star review?---it all seemed pretty convenient(yes, I know all stories finalize-but it still felt that way). Is this a bad movie?,  absolutely not!, the best thing in the movie were not the main stars but the minor characters(great lines! funny).  what makes the series holdup is humor, romance and humanity.  I just think they tried too hard.  will there be a 4th? if you pay attention to whats on the internet-4 is a go no matter what.  lets hope all involved will be retained.

B0009X7664|5.0|Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch is one of those great film performances that one can never get enough of. A film that never get's old, because it tells of a time when America was at its crossroads. This film brings memories of continuous viewing whenever shown on TV. Brock Peters play's the black defendant, falsely accused of raping a white woman. The atmosphere gives a real feel of southern Americana at its worst. A time of dispare for blacks, as evidenced by the jury of his all white \\"peers.\\" But along with the bad, were the extremely good individuals like Atticus and his family, that stood-up for justice and equality for all. Some of the best child actors ever seen on screen as well. And what has to be the best portrayal of a single father to date. One of the all-time best films on any list. See if you can spot Robert Duvall in his film debut.
B00006X06U|5.0|I didn't think I liked Joni Mitchel.  The odd-ball octave shifts annoyed me as yodeling does.  I was looking for some song of hers at the library and found Travelogue instead.  It sounded more like Diana Krall.  Very pleasing deeper voice without the old stunts.  I happend to like the orchestra and the jazz styling. <br /> <br />There is more than 2 hours of mostly-wonderful music.  There are only a few tracks that I skip.  The sound is fresh and original.  The lyrics are thought-provoking.  It comes in a nice package containing a lyrics book and a book showing some of her original paintings. <br /> <br />The only problem is that I listen to it over and over and over.  Addicted?
B000LXH0AE|4.0|This was such an interesting movie. It's a bit of a challenge, because I felt impatient with it in the beginning, wanting it to move along faster, but its plodding pace is for a purpose, I believe. It's also challenging to watch Will Farrell be so restrained, and yet I now realize what a brilliant acting job he does, because his character IS so restrained. I desperately wanted him to break out of this \\"normal\\" character and be zany, and maybe that's why the director chose him, because audiences expect him to be this wild life-embracing character we've seen him portray time and time again. But here he plays an average Joe who has consigned himself to life's mundanity. And when he does decide to try to break from his mold, it's in a quiet way. I'm still taking in this nuanced performance, because it really was lovely. <br /> <br />The film itself has many wonderful performances: Emma Thompson is simply brilliant. Queen Latifah is a rock of support, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is gorgeously incandescent. She is the shining light of this piece. <br /> <br />The message of how we create our lives and the choices we make was gloriously strong, and my first response upon the film's end was that I wanted to see it again. It's a good movie for a rainy day when you want to think about life and enjoy some milk and cookies. :)
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Brick is a bit surreal, a bit noir, and a bit high school drama. The only reason it's high school drama is because the story is played out with high school kids. What makes the film interesting and gives it its twist, is that the story feels as if it was written for a cast in their thirties.<br /><br />If Brick had played out with a more age-appropriate cast, though, it would have been more of a cliche whodunit mystery-drama. Instead, it plays out in an interestingly unique way. The audience is asked to accept the situation as reality, while at the same time being presented with the conflicting message of incongruity between the actions and the storyline. Instead of hindering the film, this actually makes it better.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt, although arguably miscast as the hardnosed detective type, plays his nonchalant protagonist with so much temperamental angst and passive strength that he almost pulls it off, despite his fragile bookish look. He's still a strong actor and helps carry the film's emotional core.<br /><br />The story itself sometimes feels a little contrived, but it's at those times that you have to remember that these are high school kids involved in over-the-top noirish detective drama. The school principal substitutes for the tough cop looking for a scapegoat, but willing to make a deal with the detective. The school jock for the loud mouth tough guy who's not really as deep into the game as he'd like people to believe. Each character substitution for the classic detective story is here, and each one is well played.<br /><br />The film wraps up cleanly and leaves the viewer satisfied. The DVD is lacking in extras, and for some reason they include the audition tape of the female lead, even though she's the weakest of the lot, and her audition tape just goes to prove that she didn't improve much from day one. Brick is definitely worth checking out, though.
0141439475|4.0|Let us compare two perspectives from which to 'see' this work by Mary Shelley---through the eyes of  Victor Frankenstein's or through the eyes of that doctor's creation.  Let's begin with the latter;  and in the words (yes, 'he' speaks in the book) of that creature/daemon/monster/being: \\"I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer.  If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existance every one will be ignorant.  My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal.  I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded.\\"<br /><br />But, alas, it was not to be for Dr. Frankenstein's bodily creation, as 'he' admits to \\"...daily vows [which] rose for revenge---a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.\\"\\"Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.\\"<br /><br />\\"Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment.  Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who,  pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.\\"  \\"...I desired love and friendship, and I was still spurned.  Was there no injustice in this?\\" \\"But it is true that I am a wretch.  I have murdered the lovely and the helpless;  I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.\\" \\"Am I to be thought the only criminal , when all humankind sinned against me?\\" And, akin to that berzerk kid in Virginia who went on a killing spree (in April of 2007) Shelley puts in the mouth of Frankenstein's creation the same words that that kid utilized after the fact: \\"You made this happen.\\"<br /><br />(Dr. Frankenstein's creation speaks well, does he not?  Get a load of this sentence from the Doctor's creation, as the creation, in his own words, describes his seeing a young girl carrying a pail thusly: \\"As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose counternance expressed a deeper despondence.\\")<br /><br />Then we have the sympathetic Dr. Victor Frankenstein:\\"I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.\\"  Actually, to be frank (pardon the pun), we not only have Victor and his creation's viewpoints, but Victor's viewpoint of the 1818 edition of this book and the 1831 revised (by Mary Shelley herself) edition.  Likewise the Doctor's creation changes in some respects between editions.  So we have 4 varying perspectives through which to view this novel, you could argue.  While there were many stylistic changes made (I consulted the 1818 text---[[ASIN:0195149017 Frankenstein (Oxford World's Classics)]]---to see for myself what the differences were, just for curiosity), more substantive changes were also made, as well (substantial enough to give us another two takes on our pair of major characters).  So, what were the changes?  Well, for the 1831 version, Dr. Frankenstein's character was made more sympathetic, \\"who is partly absolved from blame for his early errors\\" (Appendix Oxford 1818 version).  In addition, Dr. \\"Frankenstein's character is now built up as admirable\\" (Oxford again).  And Dr. Frankenstein is given lines about 'the guardian angel of my life,' as well as referring to his soul.  And, finally,  Victor's love interest is made a non-relation in the 1831 version while the women in question in the 1818 version is his consistently identified and referred to as his (first) cousin.  So, one could argue that Dr. Frankenstein was tempting fate in the 1818 version---the love interest with a first cousin and his being a scientist without an overly religious consciousness trying to replicate life; ie., attempting to play God---while in the 1831 version we get a far more sympathetic characterization of the Doctor: \\"I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thristed for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.\\"  Who can really say why Mary Shelley made these changes, but It seems hard not to credit some of the tragedies which befell her in the interim.  The 1818 novel was written by a daughter whose parents \\"had been heavily influenced by the ideals of the French Revolution,\\" and her father, to boot,  was a radical of the anarchist Left; \\"an ex-Dissenting minister turned atheist...\\"  While the 1831 version, one could conjecture, was influenced by these tragedies: the suicide of her husband's first wife (after Mary had stolen away with the then already married man), the death of 2 (of her 3) children, and the drowning of her husband.  (The latter---the Oxford edition introduction notes---put her in a more precarious financial situation (not completely relieved until her father's passing in 1844.)<br /><br />So, where does that leave us?  Which version should one read?  Well, that's your call.  Both versions  convey, in Mary Shelley's own words,  how \\"Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavor to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world.\\"  But at the same time, both versions pretty much make Dr. Frankenstein's artificial creation sympathetic too.  The two versions just reorder the stress between these two notions; the 1818 version (See [[ASIN:0393964582 Frankenstein (Norton Critical Editions)]]) leaning more heavily on the former (but nowhere nearly so as does the James Whale classic Frankenstein film---Boris Karloff's  [[ASIN:B0001CNRLQ Frankenstein - The Legacy Collection (Frankenstein / Bride of / Son of / Ghost of / House of)]]; wherein the creature is not portrayed as sympathetic and Victor is portrayed as a 'Mad' scientist), and the 1831 version being more of a fudge.  (07May) Cheersing a scientist without an overly religious consciousness trying to replicate life; ie., attempting to play God---while in the 1831 version we get a far more sympathetic characterization of the Doctor: \\"I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thristed for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.\\"  Who can really say why Mary Shelley made these changes, but It seems hard not to credit some of the tragedies which befell her in the interim.

B000A1JOUQ|5.0|I stayed away from Dr Strangelove over the years because I had the impression, coming from the 60's & being basically a farce about war it might be some stupid hippy-dippy type film. I was totally off the mark. I happened to catch A&E's bio of George C Scott & a clip of his performance in this film was shown. It was brief but funny enough to spark an interest. So I purchased a copy , it was worth it , this is a classic. <br />
B00007BHOE|3.0|Namely: Joey=genius, the rest of them=not, Cory=needs to be shot through the lungs. Not because I have a particular deathwish against the guy, but merely because that (or a similarly drastic action) is about the only thing that can save him from sounding as aweful as he does on this DVD. The opening first frames of the concert are of him screaming his throat out, and it doesn't get any better from there to the end. Even when he stops the screaming to sing the occasional line or two, it's mumbled, dispirited, as unmelodic as possible, and probably horribly off-key before a postproduction ProTools pitch shifter. (I have no way of proving this, I'm just saying.) Rather than be ashamed, like any self-respecting musician would be, he seems to wear this suck vacuum on his sleve; peppered throughout the DVD are totally unnecessary commands to the audience such as \\"JUMP!\\" (pronounced, like the jews, 'yump') or \\"SCREAM FOR ME LONDON!\\" or \\"Get your f*cking hands in the air!\\" (At least half a dozen times, that one, sometimes with a modifier: \\"Pump those fists! Make some noise!\\") or \\"Could I have my DJ back now please, is that alright?\\" or \\"Do you want something heavier motherf*ckers!\\" or \\"F*ck you! F*ck you! F*ck you! F*ck you!\\" or \\"Sing from the bottom of your heart to the top of your f*cking lungs!\\" (So that's... three inches?) or the rather terrifying \\"We are about to DESTROY this f*cking arena, my friends!\\" (At which point I have no doubt every security guard for half a mile started talking frantically up his sleve--I'm pretty sure this shot is not included on the DVD, but IMHO it would make the product ten times better just to include one half-second pan over the venue security simultaneously straightening their jackets and squaring their shoulders and looking very unhappy) or, my personal favorit: \\"C'mon dudes, this is gonna be crrruuushing!\\" If my eyes could roll any harder they would fall out of their sockets and plop onto the floor--the kind of thing that would apparently be right at home at a Slipknot concert. Furthermore--I dont' care what any Slipknot fan says--the lyrics are all but completely indecipherable. I know that right now half a million pimply-faced youths (TM) are swarming over their keyboards to correct me on this but before you do that all I ask is that you really listen to the middle of Liberate on this DVD. I'm sure you know what part i'm talking about--between the second verse and chorus where it sounds like the cookie monster saying the alphabet backwards and then spitting out a brussel sprout. I defy you to tell me that's English. It's not. IT can't be. The best you can hope for is to convince me that it's some sort of incantation to bring about a musical appocalypse--but then I remember that i'm reviewing a Slipknot DVD, not a Manson DVD, and that that would actually be cool, which Cory Taylor is clearly not. <br /> <br />That said: my disgust for Cori is equaled only by my admiration for \\"Joey\\" Jordison. The guy has only two speeds: fast and turbofast. While this is a bad thing in that he is almost always the reason why the slower songs like Wait and Bleed become medium-fast songs (he could learn a thing or two from Ginger Phish, he could), Slipknot doesn't have too many of those. (or didn't until subliminal verses Vol. III, but that wasn't released until after the DVD so none of those songs are on this.) Joey's not like traditional speed/death-metal drummers like Dave Lombardo or *insert your favorit Deathmetal favorit here*--rather than do blast beats all the way through and just mash on the doublebass as fast as humanly possible, Joey actualy uses all of his kit to the fullest. He never slows down, never gets tired, playing at 200BPM or faster pretty much the entire show--and the guy's practically a dwarf. Higher-profile drummers like Dannie Carey and Neil Piert don't play nearly as fast for as long as he does and their bodytypes are built for speed and endurance. Some have called Joey an \\"athlete, nota musician\\"; to them I say \\"You're missing the point. Your \\"musicians\\" can't do what Joey does. NO ONE can do what Joey does.\\" <br /> <br />As for the rest of the performers: both the leed and rhythm guitars play their parts well, although James cocks up a solo or two; no big deal, that's what happens when you're visiting London for the first time in front of thousands of fans with cameras in your faces recording everything. Talk about stress. As previously stated this is before Subliminal Verses though, so most of the guitar parts that are played aren't too terribly difficult. Cid the DJ does a great job, although I'd be hard-pressed to explain exactly what it means to be a DJ and do a bad job. Moving right along, ahem. The bass, keyboards, and backup percussionists probably do a good job; unfortunately you can barely hear them at all which leads me right along to... <br /> <br />Sound quality. It's not great, and it's not terrible. Cori's vocals are way out in front--which I'd qualify as huge mistake #1 but I've already said everything I need to about that--then comes the guitars, then Joey. Considering how all-out Joey's drumming is I wish they would have been able to get him louder--the crash cymbals, in particular, are seriously wimpy--but Slipknot is hardly the only band to suffer from this problem. The bass guitar you can hear pretty much only durring Purity and... er, that one with the ludicrously long bass intro. This aint Dream Theater by a longshot; Slipknot is yet another in a long, long, LONG series of bands who have their bass way too low in the mix. Same with the backup percussionists; they don't play much, but when they do, it's barely noticeable over Joey's drumming; it just sounds like an odd sheet's been put over the tom or something. I mean if you're going to bother taking these guys and their instruments on tour you might as well let them be heard the five or six times they actually do something. Sheesh. As for the keyboard, if I was Greg, I would be filing lawsuits; if you just listen to the DVD you would have no idea that Slipknot even has a keyboardist. Bleh. The portions showing the concert preparation are naet; my only gripe is that they're inserted in the middle of the concert. Not at the beginning, or the end, or as a separate title, but spread out throughout the show, interrupting the flow of the concert to show people walking around and hauling amps on stage and whatnot. The soundcheck is also somewhat lacking; guitar check, then drum check (though it's rather amusing to see Joey doing straight deathmetal doublebassing over his soundcheck) and that's it. If yer gonna bother putting in a soundcheck, you might as well show more than two or three people out of 9. C'mon. <br /> <br />As it stands, Disasterpieces is the only live DVD Slipknot has. If you want to listen to the band sounding good, get one of their studio albums; all of my gripes about Cory's voice are completely moot on any of the studio albums, he sounds miles better there. If you want to hear the band live, I recommend getting 9.0 Live; the sound quality is a little better (namely Joey is turned up a lot and the bass is turned up a little and Cory's voice has reached the point where it's gotten used to the constant abuse so it doesn't sound like he's on the vurge of coughing up a lung) and since it's a 2-disc from 2005 you get a lot more songs. If you need, need, to *see* Slipknot live (Or just Joey--his drum solo is amazing and the second disc has a camera angle just under his ride symbol you can watch for the entirety of several songs), or if you--like me--disapprove of the Pearl JJ signature snare sound, then by all means, get this; like the footage or hate the footage, the footage that is captured is unarguably unique and special.
0783114893|5.0|\\"My mother told me never to do this\\"<br /><br />So begins the horrific plot of the film The Hitcher, in which a young man travelling from Chicago to California (going through Texas for some reason) picks up a hitchhiker and ends up being terrorized for the next 95 minutes.<br /><br />The plot picks up almost immediately, with little to no exposition, and never lets up from then on. Rutger Hauer, who I'd honestly never heard of before creates one of the most menacing, intelligent, and completely psychotic villains portrayed on screen. As John Ryder, he proceeds to catch rides with cars passing by and then murder them.<br /><br />The interesting thing is that the murder victims are never really shown. The gore level isn't high in this film. It's mostly left to the viewer to imagine and this leaves the psychological effect of wondering how such a man would kill.<br /><br />Jennifer Jason Leigh steps in mid-way through and does a good job, but she's mainly a plot device and a side character. Overall, The Hitcher will not leave you saying \\"I knew that would happen next\\". It's a thrill-ride cross between action and horror with neither genre losing anything in order to accommodate the other. The stunts are amazing (especially for the 80s, including a crashing helicopter).<br /><br />The DVD has no extras, but really the presentation of the film is extra enough compared with the horror schlock that's coming out these days. Check out The Hitcher for background on why horror movies are popular.

B000NA1OXY|2.0|Two steps forward (her first two cds), one step back (her latest cd). I was really looking forward to a 3rd cd by Avril, but I was bummed when I put this disk in my car stereo! This sounds like it should be her first debut cd as it is defintely taking a step backwards. Is she is trying to be more punk? Maybe, but it does not work. It is soooooo immature! We all know she is capable of much better. Her first two cds are still some of my favorite songs. Avril, if you are listening, we are looking forward to number four. Number 3 is a miss. You are still a hottie though!

Shoot, that's just asking for trouble, so scratch that -- but it'd almost be worth being taken to court  just to be able to ask the band \\"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? -- and why in the world don't you rerelease the original mixes?\\"    Maybe we can get Rick Rubin to intervene on our behalf...    My friend just found a used First Album CD in a used bin -- and it matches the UPC and CAT# on my good mix. So if you can find a used CD with NO DATE ANYWHERE on it and but the CAT # is:  3268-2  and UPC is: 7599-273779-2 --  BUY IT.     They also destroyed the equally brilliant \\"TEJAS\\" album -- they even CHANGED GUITAR LINES on \\"Asleep in the Desert\\" AND CHOPPED STUFF UP. Cut in HALF the brutally gorgoeus harmonica lead on \\"It's Only Love\\" -- Jerks.  I think it must have been all the drugs people were doing in the 80's --- \\"hey lets spray paint over the Mona Lisa\\"     \\"Drivin while Blind\\" -- used to start with the vocal \\"A when yer drivin' down the highway at night...\\"  and now they chopped off the \\"A when yer...\\"  so now you practically  hear the punch-in . Now it starts...    \\"(d)rivin' down the highway at night...\\"   WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT???     'Tejas' nearly unlistenable. So sad. How can we pressure The Top into UNmixing their remixes? Hmmm...    BUT OH JOY! I did just find a MINT CONDITION PROMOTIONAL LP  of TEJAS in a used bin at FREAK BEAT RECORDS in Sherman Oaks CA -- so I'm gonna bounce that from wax  to CD to tide me over until Rhino Records works their magic and remasters the orignal (God bless Rhino Records)...
B0000025H0|5.0|If you listen to nothing else on this album but Aqua Marine, it has paid for itself.  Aqua Marine is one of the best instrumentals, in and  outside of the Santana collection. Other songs on the album are typical of the era for many artist; \\"Where do i go now, Jazz, Rock-n-roll.....?\\".  I have this on vinyl and now it's time to get it on CD.
B00005JPFF|4.0|What set the \\"Spider-Man\\" films apart from many other superhero films was a delicate balance between comic book action and emotion, between high tech special effects and human drama. In this regard, Sam Raimi's \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is in no way a departure from the first two films; it remains on perfectly equal ground, presenting a story that carefully combines frenetic fight sequences, grandiose science fiction, and an emotional roller coaster. I don't dare assume that this is the best film in the series, nor can I claim that it's the greatest superhero film ever made. What I can say is that, like its predecessors, \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is a fun movie that is sure to entertain those who are willing to experience it.    The first major scene has Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) lying on a giant spider web in the middle of a park, staring up at the night sky. The romantic aspect plays itself to the fullest, and rightfully so; the emotional core of the story depends on their love and possible engagement, which will be tested in more ways than one. The first test arrives on a rogue meteorite that crash-lands in the park (where it came from is never explained, but I suppose it doesn't really matter); a viscous, shape shifting black goo emerges from its smoldering cocoon. It then attaches itself to Parker's motorbike and follows him home, where it waits. For what is not yet known, but if there's one thing to be sure about in this kind of film, it's that anything from outer space--especially a dark sludge--most likely means trouble.    The second test is Spider-Man's fame, which is putting a strain on Parker and M.J.'s relationship. It seems to be going to Parker's head lately, and it shows during an award ceremony (Spidey is given the key to the city for his heroic acts). He swings into the crowd and high-fives a number of kids before doing gymnastics on the stage. He then hangs upside down and asks the presenter--Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard)--tokiss him like M.J. did in the first movie. It was never meant to be romantic; it was only for the sake of publicity. Nonetheless, M.J. is not at all amused. Parker is unconsciously pushing her away to keep his Spider-Man image strong, which doesn't exactly boost her self-confidence. It doesn't help that her dream of staring in a Broadway musical is shattered; the critics have a field day attacking her singing voice, and she's fired from the production.    The third test is Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict. Because of a scientific accident only possible in a comic book adaptation, his molecular structure has been altered into grains of sand. At will, he can change from a solid man into the gritty monster Sandman; he can even meld with other forms of earth and make himself gigantic. But what exactly are his motives? I ask this because he was crafted as a sympathetic character: despite having done bad things to people, his only concern is the well being of his young daughter, who's apparently quite ill (with what is never revealed). What makes the situation worse is that he was responsible for the death of Parker's uncle. This ignites a rage within Parker, and it only gets stronger when the black space slime finally makes contact. Not only does it attach itself to his Spider suit, turning it black, it also intensifies Parker's aggression and fuels his hatred. It also makes him arrogant during normal daily life, an aspect that's more comical than serious.    The fourth test is rival photographer, Eddie Brock, Jr. (Topher Grace), who threatens Parker's position at the \\"Daily Bugle.\\" Loud-mouthed Editor in Chief J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) offers a desk job to anyone who can capture an incriminating photo of Spider-Man; this paves the way for a number of circumstances that eventually turn Brock and Parker into bitter enemies. I distinctly remember a scene in a church, in which Brock prays that God murder Parker. How heavy-handed for a superhero story: it could have been humorous had the atmosphere not been so intense. And it gets even more intense when he comes into contact with a bit of the black space goo; it turns him into the vile super villain known as Venom.    The fifth and final test is Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose rage over the death of his father is deepening. Having since discovered the true identity of Spider-Man, he now vows to destroy Peter Parker, his former best friend. Not only does he fight with Parker as the New Goblin, he also forces M.J. to break up with Parker. At this point in the story, it's becomes obvious that revenge is the main theme. Granted, this isn't an original idea (consider \\"Batman\\"). However, hidden beneath the vengeful layers is the possibility of forgiveness, and that alone made this film a lot more enjoyable. By the time we get to the climactic battle at a construction site (reminiscent of Raimi's own \\"Darkman\\"), the audience will discover who can let go of the past and who will remain stuck in the depths of hate.    And yes, they'll be treated to a number of impressive battle sequences, all of which rely heavily on computer generated imagery. I purposely avoided elaborating on this; despite being prominently featured, \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is about more than its eye candy; it's about balancing its eye candy with its human story. Generally speaking, it worked quite well (I exempt a dance sequence at a jazz club; talk about unnecessary). In fact, the entire \\"Spider-Man\\" series worked quite well, and with that, I have only one more thing to say: if you liked the first two, you'll definitely like the third.
0618680004|1.0|If you wish to read a well written book by an intellectual, try \\"What's so great about Christianity\\".  In this book, Dawkins rambles on how Christianity is the cause for all bad things in the world, but if you strip away all the rhetoric, all that is left is how Dawkins was injured and assaulted as a child.  He had a lousy childhood (of which I feel bad about) and he now takes it out on Christianity.
B00005JPFF|5.0|Spider-Man 3 (SM3) had a lot of hype to live up to. Personally I had found Spider-Man 2 (SM2) to be very good, but still lacking in some areas. Even Ghost Rider had better character writing than SM2 did, so I was very hopeful that SM3 would succeed at truly setting a new bar. . Now having seen the premiere, I think it did. <br /> <br />The action is well paced and spread throughout the movie from start to finish, one thing that SM2 had problems with. While I'm sure that many people will complain about the non-action parts, especially the dance scene at the Jazz club, those are simultaneously some of the funniest and most poignant parts of a movie which contains quite an emotional rollercoaster, and I loved it. <br /> <br />Some people will also complain that because there are so many characters included, certain story arcs were too rushed, and would have made better full movies on their own. It is true that before seeing SM3, I had feared that it would suffer from \\"Batman & Robin\\" syndrome, but those fears were quite thoroughly allayed. The cast was just the right size, and each character received just the right amount of screen time to satisfy their part of the story without any tangential long-windedness. <br /> <br />THE LOW-DOWN: This movie is extremely good, extremely heartfelt with many highs and just as many lows. It is hysterically funny in several sections, and never feels forced at any point. IMHO, one of the best-written scripts in a long time, and equally perfect acting, especially from Tobey Maguire. The production is spot-on, and I can't imagine a more perfect final cut could have been made, the pacing is just brilliant. <br /> <br />It assumes the new #2 spot on my greatest superhero movie list, narrowly behind Batman Begins. Superman Returns moves to #3, followed by Ghost Rider, and SM2 rounds out the top 5. <br />

B000MGUZM0|5.0|To me, this is the best album that I've listened to in quite some time. You're doing yourself a favor by getting this. I absolutely recommend playing this on your home system.  It really comes alive as if it's a live performance; none of that overlaying [...] here.  The recording is truly amazing. Every instrument (there's a lot), every voice (diddo), is crystal clear.    I can't get enough of this album.
B00005JPFH|4.0|For me I enjoyed the third installment of the Spiderman series. It's not the best, but it is still a great movie to watch. This one ties in two villans into one movie: The Sandman, and Venom. Also it has the Black Spiderman in this movie as well. I agree with JR Pinto's review believing that was a little too much with the movie and overdoing it. However I don't find that a problem at all since it was most likely going to be the last movie of the series, and everything tied into each other very well.<br /><br />With all of the events and villians appearing in the movie, it was very hard to fit everyone into a two hour movie. Not saying that it wasn't done, but it was very difficult. Many people (like myself) will probably forget that The Sandman will be part of the movie, because he dissapears for a while and so much is inside of the gam (Mary Jane breakups, the Black Spiderman suit). In fact, there are a lot of gaps in the movie that some people may forget, and may think that it appeared out of nowhere. As for the villians, it seems like each movie they want to do the same thing, hold Mary Jane suspended from a very high point and have Spiderman come and rescue her, just like every superhero is supposed to.<br /><br />Favorite parts will have to be when Peter Parker wears the Black Spiderman suit. That alone looks nice. A few action scenes are enjoyable like the fights between Peter Parker/Spiderman and Harry Osborne/New Goblin. The end of the movie is kind of nice though as most of this movie ties into Spiderman 1. Spiderman fans will be happy for this one despite the clutterness of the movie. I recommend you check this out. I myself can't wait for this to come on DVD (I want the bundle pack too!!!). An action packed movie will more than likely satisfy your needs. Peace!<br /><br />Spider-Man 4??? Naaaaaaaah...
0312199066|5.0|Gene Cernan's detailed, autobiographical account of his personal and career Naval aviator, then NASA experiences, first as a Navy test pilot, then as a Gemini and two time Apollo Astronaut.  A great read for those of us that missed out on the decade of the 60s space race, culminating in six successful, history making U.S. astronaut manned explorations of the Moon.  Mr. Cernan's contributions toward that end were significant and certainly most memorable was his final space flight as Mission Commander of Apollo 17; the mission that began spectacularly as the only night time launch of the gargantun Saturn V rocket and ended with the last American flag, Lunar Rover and footprints left in the Tarrus Littrow Valley of the Moon in December 1972.  Accounts of Dr. Rock, Harrison Schmidt, the only civilian scientist to visit the Moon, and their jubilently described 70+ hours of EVA, lunar dig sites and geological finds are lengendary.  Gene Cernan and all the other astronauts of that era, both U.S. and Russian, all incredibly brave men made of the \\"right stuff\\", shall always be remembered as histories earliest spaceflight pioneers and the original explorers of the Cosmos.  BRAVO!!!
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Enterprise Season Three has been touted as one long episode, and I have to agree, but I liked it just the same. Yes there weren't 20 something  episodes about different planets, exploring space, meeting and greeting resident and hostile alien species. This was one season, full of one basic storyline, saving earth from the xindi weapon. Crossing into the expanse was as if the crew was crossing into \\"junior\\" year of space school, no more fun and games its time to get serious and think about the future. We get to see the crew of the enterprise grow both internally and closer to eachother, especially Tripp and T'pol. The Resident science officer , to me, had the most story lines revolved around her next to the captain of course. T'pol was exploring her own emotions, relationships, job and love life throughout , talk about character growth! My favorite episodes, although all of them were amazing, were:<br /><br />Impulse-I love me some zombies, and I loved me some Vulcan zombies even more! Trillium infected vulcans are downright frightening, and even worse was T'pol getting infected by it, although I loved seeing her flip out.<br /><br />Exile- This was the most \\"Buffy-like\\" episode of star trek I have ever seen for some reason. Maybe it was the demon like telepath who got a hankering for Hoshi to become his consort till death, or maybe it was the whole crystal thing he used to magnify his powers, I still liked it though.<br /><br />Twilight- Captain archer gets a spacial parasite thingee in his brain and his short term memory doesn't work, so we see the future where earth is gone and the xindi are hunting down leftover humans, and more importantly we see how loyal and loving T'pol really is towards Archer. I cried my eyes out in this one.<br /><br />NorthStar- I have always always always hated \\"Trek Westerns\\" where on star trek they find some alien planet that has some random western motif going on, its always cheesy with its pink skyline and tumbleweeds. BUT this episode cured that hatred, it actually made sense! Aliens kidnapped humans for slaves, brought them to a planet, and the humans revolted, but never evolved technically or socially. Archer looked darn fine in that hat.<br /><br />Similitude- Tripp gets hurt, and Phlox makes a clone of him called \\"sim\\" to transplant brain matter to tripp and save his life, Archer makes the decision to go ahead with the clone, and realizes that its not so easy to create a life that is sentient and than later have to kill it to save another life. We get to see, via \\"sims\\" memories from tripp, that he likes T'pol in a romantic way, and she is so sweet to give him that kiss, I seriously cried again.<br /><br />Proving Ground- I am in love with the Andorians, Commander Shran is freaking brilliant, adorable, and one of the best aliens ever on star trek. He is both enemy and friend, and this is the episode that shows that dichotomy I love the \\"we have come here to get some....archerite from this planet\\"<br /><br />Doctors Orders- God, I love Phlox and a whole entire episode devoted to him? Heaven. The crew is in a stasis state and he must take care of them while they travel 4 days, he starts to hallucinate, get paranoid, and eventually has to save enterprise by himself!<br /><br />There are too many to list, too many good ones. The spheres, the 5 xindi species, Degra, the constant interference from Daniels, the cliffhangers, its all just such amazing TV I cant understand any Trek fan, or sci fi nut who wouldn't love this, totally worth the bucks.red, it actually made sense!

B0001US62I|5.0|Angel Heart is one of the best morphs of the picture genres of drama and horror on the market.  Alan Parker does an excellent job with a film that is pure story telling, in the tradition of Polanski and Friedkin before him.  Its a film that rivets you with excellent cinematography, acting, and clues big and small. <br /> <br />One of the major attractions to watching Angel Heart is following along with Mickey Rourke's Harry Angel in piecing together all the clues.  This viewing attraction will most likely be amiss for new viewers because Amazon placed a major spoiler in the synop. <br /> <br />Why?  Two thumbs down to Amazon for revealing \\"the ending\\" to a great story that would otherwise send chills down your spine.
B000002UWP|5.0|Another of my favorites, great music for long car ride. My children  are now enjoying. Wonderful love songs & vocals.
B00004RFFW|5.0|For those of you that are over 17 or grew up watching the die hard movies or were able to see rated r movies when you were three years under age because your parents thought you were mature enough this movie is for you.  Do to heavy violencen action seqeunces, occasional language this movie might not be appropriate or may be questionable to children under the age of 17 depending on what there parents or guardian think is appropriate. This is and very old dvd it celebrate it's 7th anniversary in DVD format this year. Since this dvd is old and there are plenty of copies tdue to it's high popularity you probably should not pay more than $25 dollars for a copy of this unless you are bying the whole quadrilogy at once and not just the second film. Try to get this used to if possible and not in new condition because some the copies can be over 25 dollars. Mel Gibson an Danny glover take up there gones again in this action packed seqeul to the original movie. Can young Revis and his partner stop a drug gain from smugglig out of the country find out in this action packed sligtly extended version. If you liked the die hard movies and the robo cops which were good until the fourth installment then they went done hill you will enjoy this.

Buy this book and then you can attend---without paying thousands of dollars.I can't begin to translate the experience to this review but it was the best time and money I have spent in years. My business doubled in the year after attending. He really deserves all the hype and success he has now achieved because he is absolutely changing lives.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Another terrific record from the not-so-newly-reborn Rush.  The music, as always, is solid.  Lots of textures and deep, heavy grooves.  The drum sound is especially good on this record.  It was an excellent move to use that producer.  I thought Vapor Trails was the perfect album for them at that time and now this seems like the logical follow-up.  It seems to have the same guitar-heavy aggressiveness, but the band has pulled back in some of it's more progressive qualities to expand its sound.   <br />It's not a return to \\"glory days,\\" and nor should it be.  Those days are gone and rightly so.  It would be ridiculous for this band to try to recreate something from 30 years ago.  Why recreate anything?   <br />As with the last record, my chief complaint is with the lyrics.  Not that they are bad, but that they seem to be musically restrictive.  It sounds like Geddy has shoe-horn the lyrics into places they just can't fit comfortably, like there are too many words.  And often, there are vocals where it would be nice to just rock out to the groove for a bit.   <br />But and excellent listening experience nonetheless.
B00005JPFF|1.0|Right now, I know you're not going to want to believe me.  But trust me, this movie isn't what you think it is.  I loved the first Spider-Man movie.  I tell people that it took me on the whole emotional journey: I laughed, I cried, and I had more fun that I did during any other super hero movie.  And then I enjoyed the second Spider-Man movie. <br /> <br /> But there were those rumors that Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, and Kirsten Dunst all wanted out of the franchise.  And there were those rumors that the producers wanted to do more, with or without them.  About halfway through \\"Spider-Man 3\\", I got the distinct impression that writer/director Raimi and star Maguire were intentionally trying to sabotage the franchise, brilliantly screwing the studio heads begging for more sequels and, consequentially, the audience as well. <br /> <br /> The movie starts out promisingly enough, as an excellent character drama in the spirit of the first two movies.  Like the first two, the movie puts the emphasis squarely on the character of Peter Parker and his relationship with those around him, specifically beautiful redhead Mary Jane and \\"New Goblin\\" James Franco, as well as Eddie Brach Gwen Stacey, Aunt May, Sandman, J. Jonah Jameson, Captain Stacey, and too many others for the director to keep track of, even if he wanted to, which Raimi certainly doesn't seem to.  Then there's the sloppy handling of the introduction of the symbiote that will eventually create Venom.  And there's also the annoying continuity error of Eddie Brach, already mentioned as being a photographer for the Daily Bugle in the second movie, coming to the Bugle for the first time in search of a job. <br /> <br /> Despite a few excellent action sequences, the character drama soon devolves into an overly long soap opera filled with love triangle upon triangle and other contrived interactions between the characters.  The movie then devolves further into a B-list monster movie.  Along the way, it mixes in song-and-dance numbers, extremely awkward and sometimes laughable moments, forced humor, and cliché lines from cheesy buddy cops movies.  And the whole time the dialogue and situations become more and more cringe-worthy, to the point it seems certain that Raimi and Maguire were trying to make the worst movie possible in order to guarantee there wouldn't be a \\"Spider-Man 4.\\"  The movie climaxes in a series of sickly sweet, over-the-top, sappy \\"moral of the story\\" scenes. <br /> <br /> Kirsten Dunst at least seems to not be trying to destroy the movie, turning in one of the film's better performances.  Nor does Christopher Young, who takes over scoring duties from Danny Elfman, who also wanted desperately out of the franchise.  The special effects people also seem to still be trying to turn in their best work, doing incredible jobs of bringing Sandman and Venom to life, even though the movie's major showdown involving the two villains seems like something out of a cheap Godzilla or King Kong movie.  Bryce Dallas Howard is kinda cute as Gwen Stacey but seems somehow unnatural.  Meanwhile, Topher Grace as Eddie Brach/Venom seems to be playing a more contemporary version of his character from \\"That 70's Show\\" while Tobey Maguire, who did an amazing job portraying Peter Parker in the first two movies, mugs so much that he, once again, seems intent on sabotaging the franchise.   <br /> <br /> The only other people involved with the film who did a decent job were the advertisers.  By placing elements of all the best scenes into every trailer, they raised my expectations for \\"Spider-Man 3.\\"  I haven't been this disappointed by a movie in a long time.     <br /> <br />      <br />
