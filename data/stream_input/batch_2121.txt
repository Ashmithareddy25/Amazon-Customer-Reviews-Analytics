B00846F1YW|4.0|Amazons app of the day another pretty good game. Permissions are not crazy which is good and the size of the game is around 22 mbs. The graphics of this game are very nice and the gameplay is great. They have seemed to fix the bug on chapter 13.1. This hidden obeject game is like others but does have a very nice plot to it and great graphics to go along with it. It runs very nicely on the galaxy s3.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Another breat British series, would recommend to anyone.<br />Will order all other series/ shows for this and looking forward to teh enxt season
0385720920|5.0|This book was a very good read. I found it very interesting. It is not for the weak of heart though and definitely not for children. I thought this book was one of the author's best books. It really got you thinking. It also got you so engrossed in the book. I really recommend reading this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|this season did not disappoint i would have given it all 5 stars<br />but my disappointment that the season is almost over stops me
B0016492BW|5.0|They made a legend of comedy in blu-ray, what could be better! This has so many extra features it is amazing! The clarity of the movie is breath taking! I am very happy with this purchase, and will hold on to this one. I am happy to see that they are making these older classic movies in bluray!
B007RX32TY|3.0|Kill for Love and Lady are amongst my favorite songs of 2012. Into the Black, Back from the Grave and The Page rounds out a fantastic first 1/3 of the album. Unfortunately the album seem to hit a snag afterwards and just seems to drone on without much purpose from Broken Mirrors to A Matter of Time. The last 3 song close out the album in a reasonably satisfactory manner but still pale in comparison to the first 5 songs. Very inconsistent album with some outstanding songs.
B008PNBU30|2.0|I was so excited to see a new 3 Days Grace cd, and I bought it with high hopes ... but I wasn't overly impressed.  I'm still spinning this one since I'm seeing them in concert soon, but frankly I like the older music better.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|The acting was decent and story predicable but funny nonetheless. Good for a date night movie but I would not rush out to see it.

B00919CI5Q|5.0|Pros: This card is a beast. Anything I have thrown at it, this card has completely blown away.<br /><br />Powerful:<br />I have played BF3, Skyrim, GTA4, AC3, Saints Row: The Third, Civ V, and many other games all at max graphic settings (including AA). The only game that gave it pause was Metro 2033 which required me to turn down the AA a little. Best of all I get 60 FPS most of the time in all of these games. Every time I've had FPS drops it has been due to my CPU (see other thoughts).<br /><br />Cool:<br />This GPU idles at a nice 30-35, and under heavy load it will reach about 55; never seen it go past that even after 5+ hours of BF3.<br /><br />Quiet:<br />The cooler is completely silent, even under load I can't hear it.<br /><br />Drivers:<br />NVidia has extremely good drivers for their cards; I've yet to have any problems with them what so ever. I've used the control panel to calibrate my monitors, and control some settings for certain games. But aside from update notifications, I don't notice the program running in the background.<br /><br />ASUS:<br />I've purchased tons of ASUS products before, and have never been disappointed. They are really one of the few brands I trust right now. I've also dealt with getting a laptop repaired by them. The process could have been smoother, but they had my laptop fixed within a few weeks, covered shipping and repair costs completely, and only treated me with care and respect.<br /><br />This card has everything you want in a video card for a relatively cheap price compared to the newer Geforce cards.<br /><br />Cons: None. That is truly saying something since I can think of at least one issue with every other part I bought for my build.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: Don't cheap out on the CPU. I made the mistake of getting an AMD Phenom II X4 965 Quad-Core @ 3.4GHz CPU. So far it performs acceptably, but it is CLEARLY the bottleneck in every game I've played so far. If I had a good i5, I'd be getting 60FPS pretty much all the time. But in CPU-heavy games like Skyrim, my rig will drop my FPS to about 40ish in cities and places with large amounts of NPCs.<br />Dish out the extra $50-$100 and get a nice CPU to support this card; you will notice the difference. I'm saving up for a new CPU now because of this.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of people building new PCs or upgrading and they are all going for 680s and 690s or 560 Ti's. I STRONGLY believe this is the card to get right now; this exact card from ASUS. There is no point in dishing out twice the money for a 680/690 because you will only see a few FPS difference. Even the 660 TI's are not worth the money. And the 560's are extremely dated now since they only have 1GB of VRAM. In games like Skyrim, VRAM is extremely important; in any texture-heavy game this is the case.<br /><br />In case you are wondering what my build is that this part was used in:<br />-AMD Phenom II X4 965 Black Edition Deneb 3.4GHz Quad-Core Processor<br />-ARCTIC Freezer 7 Pro Rev.2<br />-Seagate Barracuda ST1000DM003 1TB 7200 RPM<br />-ASUS GTX660-DC2O-2GD5 GeForce GTX 660 2GB<br />-COOLER MASTER Elite 430 RC-430-KWN1 Case<br />-CORSAIR Enthusiast Series TX650 V2 650W<br />-G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 8GB (2 x 4GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600<br />-GIGABYTE GA-970A-UD3the time.

B00846REIS|3.0|If you read 50, then you read this. I gave it three strs because of the very familiar storyline. the major pro to this bool, is that it was an easier read than 50. i found myself rushing the book because i wanted a difference to show up. this book has me intriqued enough to perhaps to read part #2 just to see if the smiliar continues.
B00755MHXG|5.0|Truly an amazing story with life lessons for young and old. Loved the plot and writing style. Makes you feel like a kid again! WONDERful!
B004OZOTSQ|2.0|I'm sure this is a wonderful app, but I bought it in the amazon app store and cannot find it on my device. I have a Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. It says I already own the app and to find in my Apps library but it's not there. The same thing goes for a couple other apps I bought like a calculator. Any help is appreciated so that I may change my rating for this app. On a side note, when i use es file explorer, It says I don't have any videos or movies, but I clearly have one under the Videos section that I have watched.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|LOVED IT! LOVE MARK WAHLBERG HES AWESOME! ALTHOUGH NOT A MOVIE  YOU WANT TO WATCH AROUND LITTLE ONES OR IMMATURE PEOPLE.
B009VB97EY|4.0|If you're watching it to see some hot guys dance around, keep watching. If you want a captivating movie with a great storyline, this isn't your movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A quick read. I think most will find themselves able to Identify<br />with the main characters emotions at an undeniably turbulent <br />stage of life. A common theme with complex relationships. The plot goes just deep enough to leave the reader personally involved. Instant classic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is so well done.  I am eager to see Season 4.  The cast is awesome.  I have also learned a lot of British terminology which is interesting and fun.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|A couple of my friends have the lifeproof case and I absolutely love the case. I saw on amazon that they were selling it and I purchased it thinking I was purchasing the actual \\"lifeproof case\\". When it arrived it was very flimsy and I was skeptical if it was even waterproof. Although it did arrive in the retail lifeproof box. I called amazon customer support and they knew of the problem with these cases as other people have complained about them being FAKE. I am writing this review because I do think amazon should have to tell us before we buy that we are buying a flimsy piece of plastic for $50 that is NOT WATERPROOF. YES I DID THE WATERTEST AND IT LET WATER IN BY THE PORT CONNECTOR.<br />Spend the extra $20 and go to store
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|The book is yet another in the Jack Ryanseries - focusing on Jack Ryan Jr exploits, and his cooleagues. The problem with the book is yet again, nothing really untoward happens to our heroes. Even the ones who are getting old prove that they are not that old, and the young and inexperienced ones have jsut the right amount of experience to make it happen. So while there is polenty of drama and suspense - it is the same flavor as last time, and it all works the same way. No reversals in the field ofr the good guys.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|awesome book ! a page turner .... easy read .  a very heat warming romance , eith a twist....looking forward to the movie.... highly recommended
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|the storyline was a bit slow and repetitive in parts. the end third was the best part.did not find it particularly page turning.
B00005N6KG|1.0|These headphones are truly awful. They are not worth it for any price. They sounds exceptionally bad, are not at all comfortable and don't stay put. I replaced them with [[ASIN:B0094R4Q6Y Sennheiser PMX 685i SPORTS In-Ear Neckband Headphones - Black]] which fit well in my ears, sound good and don't shift around at all. They also have a button and a mic allowing for phone calls etc.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching the season two seasons behind and got hooked onto it. Amazon made it easy through free TV pass to purchase the episodes and watch them from a number of devices. It was great to be able to watch on my own time and to continue to watch them. Yeah!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was very excited when they FINALLY came out with Pinterest app for Kindle!!! And it didn't disappoint!! I never had any issues with this app, it doesn't crash,easy to use!!! Thank you from a big Pinterest fan :)
0792163710|3.0|If you like old westerns, you will defintily like this movie.  I can watch it over and over like John Waynes and Clint Eastwood westerns.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game good graphics, especially for free. Would recommend to anyone who likes hidden objects games with a bit of a story line.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a very enjoyable game.  I like watching the birds fly away!  This is a game that I will play often.
B0095P33IW|4.0|As a fan of the comics it is great to see this character visualized in a movie that is not completely cheesy. Late 70's and early 80's visions of Captain America were much lower budget and under visualized verisons.<br />The story was a great installment as we waited for The Avengers to assemble in their power/action packed movie.<br />The acting abilities of Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving and Stanley Tucci show in this movie. You will either love it or hate it, but either way its a really good watch!
B0014DQSG2|4.0|You don't see many light-hearted movies about repairing relationships between 17-year-olds and their fathers. Yes, it was fairy-tale-ish. Yes, it was a little hokey. The villain (Jonathon Pryce) didn't quite have a waxed mustache, but it was close. But Colin Firth is, well, Colin Firth, i.e., one amazing actor who took what might have been a forgettable, throw-away film and made it wonderful. Amanda Bynes was a ray of sunshine. And did I mention it was delightfully and gloriously clean! All in all, a very pleasant surprise.
B000000OPQ|5.0|I love the songs on this CD. reminds me of when I was a little girl, this is the sort of music I just long to hear more of!

030788743X|5.0|Absolutely amazing.  I read this book in 2.5 days.  I was completely unable to put it down.  Once finished, I sent a copy to my brother-in-law, and another to a long time friend.  Excellent story, very well written, gripping all the way to the end.  For us classic geeks, this book also brought back a LOT of nostalgia about some of the first video games ever made and played.<br />A wonderful book that has a permanent place in my library.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept your interest from start to finish. The twists and turns in this story kept you wanting more and surprised and shocked at times. I think you laughed and cried but the auther brought this book to life and thats why you felt the pain and happines and humor. I could go on and on but this story is one that its better to read and experience in your own mind. The auther did a great job in telling a story from start to finish. a must read
B00355L2TU|4.0|I was looking for a 30 minute workout that will give me maximum results for that amount of time.  I think this workout gives you a great combination of strength and cardio.  I've been doing it for about 12 days and it's still challenging for me.  I will upgrade to the next level once I feel like this one is no longer pushing me.  All you need is a mat (unless you're working out on carpet) and some ~3 pound hand weights.  You could go higher or lower, but three pounds works well.  I'm glad I found this series and plan to stick with Jillian Michaels workouts.

B00ABO573A|4.0|i liked the movie.  good story line.  and good characters.  kept my attention.  not too heavy but serious subject matter.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is an awesome book! I think that this is a must read for everyone! It is not too suitable for little children due to the graphic nature of the book but over all its really great read!
B0063IH60K|3.0|this game is good but it needs to be a more organized. When retrieving card from the deck in the 3 cards draw I couldn tell the difference from the cards already played from the deck. I don't know what you call the space where you put the Aces at but when you have cards il there and have drawn. from the deck you cant tell where the deck is that needs to be fix. And everytime you start a new game you get meet with a Ad that. you physically have to skip. I hats that.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I like that you can choose different kinds of deals.  Easy to use and moves quickly.  I like to play it everyday.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is pretty fun and challenging.  The levels do get somewhat repetitive though.  The same surroundings keep coming up again and again.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Really liked the way real events were worked into the plot.  Recommend for all history buffs.  Fast moving and exciting,
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|A well written novel that gives a fresh look at one successful country in Africa.  The author gives us many lessons and an appreciation for the people of Botswana.  Stories are engagingly charming.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Many people had been telling me I would love this show.  Indeed, I did and even spent 4 hours in a row on a Sunday afternoon watching Season 1.  Have now finished Season 2 and am catching up on Season 3.
B008ALAHA4|3.0|Leave it to Apple to call a problem of their own creation, &#34;innovation&#34; and &#34;progress&#34;. In their effort to slim down their new MacBook Pro laptops, Apple had to create a slimmer MagSafe. For those who already had a MagSafe power supply, this converter is now necessary in order to keep that power supply from becoming just another techno brick. It does exactly what it was intended to do, thus the 3 stars. I dropped 2 stars because this is just one more tiny, easily-lost, Apple hand-cuffs.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The story and characters are riveting.  This is what great TV is all about!  I am required to write six more words.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Trouble With The Curve felt like a movie that was constantly trying to find its groove.  Clint Eastwood's character is so surly and changes so little throughout the majority of the movie that he is difficult to like, which is bad for the character who spends the most time onscreen.  It's almost as if they took his character from Gran Torino and placed him in a baseball movie, except that his character in Gran Torino changed more.<br /><br />The biggest fault with this movie is the way it was advertised.  It was made to feel like a warm story of a father and daughter reconnecting over their love of baseball after drifting apart for many years.  Rather, it was darker than I anticipated, and less enjoyable.  That's not to say it wasn't a good story, more that it wasn't told in a way I found enjoyable.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I was supposed to be asleep a couple hours ago but just couldn't stop playing. Normally I don't bother to spend money on apps but this came highly recommended by a friend and man am I glad I listened. Finally a game that causes you to think.
0425252868|5.0|This might be the best WW II memoir I've ever read, other than the one written by my high school sweethearts dad's ( James E. Brooks, \\" A glimpse of Hell \\"). Literally, could not put it down !  Adam is to be commended for his efforts to bring this story of bravery, dedication to duty, and the sad facts of war with a special attention to details. I highly recommend this to all who love examples of patriotism !

B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We have watched the video several times and everyone from 6 yr to 60 yr just love the movie. Bravo!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I think this author has a future.  I loved the book.  The book follows a guy left behind on a Mars mission and how he manages to survive.  The majority of the book is written as log entries by the marooned crewman.  Eventually someone figures out he's actually still alive and then the narrative switches between the log entries and the efforts going on by NASA on earth to try and rescue him.  It was a terrific story.  I also just loved the ending, it was perfect!
B004PGAQMW|5.0|Fun movie for all ages. Very entertaining for kids and adults. We have 6 yr to 60 yr in our house and we love to watch this movie!
1430308001|5.0|I don't recall how I found this book, but I am glad that I did.<br /><br />I have many many chess books, a number of which are on tactics. This book along with the second volume are amongst the best when it comes to explaining the construction of a variety of tactics.<br /><br />For instance, in Mr. Farnsworth's discussion of the basic Knight Fork he \\"articulates\\" something that is obvious in many tactic puzzle books, and which newcomers and some experienced chess players fail to realize proceedurally. That being if your opponent has two pieces withing forking distance for the knight and your knight is on the same color square as the targets then the fork is considered workable. If one of the ideal targets is on another colored square,  and near to a square within striking distance of the knight, the author explains how you might cause the piece to move to the target (forking)square. This is done through distraction or deflection. Mr. Farnsworth spells it out that for those of us that want to really understand the concepts through explanation rather than just solving tactical exercises without articulation, and hoping that someday in one of your games this pattern will show up (and of course you remember having seen it before). As one reviewer has mentioned the author starts out on basic levels and builds up his explanations to greater and more complex considerations of each tactic.<br /><br />This is a large sized book. It would take up more room in your daypack than a regular sized chess book and it takes some time to read and digest all that the author has presented here. But believe me, the effort is worth it. Even if you are not into reading lots of detail you should still purchase the book and go over it in chunks. You won't regret the investment in your time or money.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|i have watch this movie 2 time or more great bodes in this movie which you<br />could see them in person
B001NHNG64|5.0|I have now read 5 - always a good read - but to me this one this best yet. The hero seemed more human, the plot fresh,  more indepth and credible, no. obvious &#34;throw in a bit of sex to get a wider audience&#34; bits, and I found the whole book hard to put down. I have never read the Reacher books in order they were written, and in a way after this one, glad I did not.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|In 2019, the Tyrell Corporation has manufactured organic robots identical to humans called \\"replicants\\", which are used as slave labor on off-world colonies. If a replicant disobeys and returns to Earth, a Blade Runner hunts them down and \\"retires\\" them- in other words, executes them. This story follows Deckard (Harrison Ford), a retired Blade Runner, who agrees to hunt down four violent replicant that have escaped into Los Angeles. Blade Runner is a mesmerizing and thought-provoking SciFi film.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story in Blade Runner; it's a story that doesn't have to rely on action. Although it may sound like a chase film, it's much more than a typical SciFi action flick; it uses it's visuals, dialogue, and action to create a deeper experience. The film uses hypnotizing music, and stunning visuals to create an eerie-like atmosphere- it places you into a thinking mood. There are many versions of this film, some more thought-provoking than others; I say this because the film can generally be perceived in many ways, especially the ending. I recommend watching this film multiple times, starting with the International version then the Final Cut. The pacing is a bit slow, the acting is great, the music is amazing, and the visuals are breathtaking.<br /><br />I own the 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition (Blu-Ray). The first disc has the Final Cut; The second disc has the Theatrical Cut, the International Cut, and the Director's Cut; the third disc has the Workprint Version and the special features. All of the discs are Blu-Ray, no DVDs. The picture quality has been upgraded significantly and the film looks phenomenal, matching most modern films; this is definitely one of the best upgrades I've seen and I hope more classic films get this treatment.<br /><br />Overall, Blade Runner is an amazing SciFi film, with an extremely immersive SciFi atmosphere, stunning cinematography, mesmerizing music, and a deep storyline (depending on your perception, of course). I highly recommend the 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition (Blu-Ray) for fans and first-time viewers, because it is the definitive version and has all of the versions of the film- the slightest differences can really change your opinion.<br /><br />Blade Runner has violence and blood, and brief nudity.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|great show...too bad was not able to pull up other episodes...the Amazon service is very &#34;episodic&#34;. ;) Was looking for the rest of season and could not pull it up.

B0073LWEXK|4.0|Initally, I thought it was dull but the more I advanced the more I liked it.  The only draw back is that it is practically impossible to get through the first time without using the hint button.
0374214913|2.0|Wow - that was pretty terrible. I'm actually a little surprised I managed to get through the book - but I was on a lengthy cross-country flight with only one book to keep me occupied and didn't have much say in the matter (note to self - always pack kindle and/or back-up book).<br /><br />So why a \\"D\\" and not an \\"F\\"? Well, there were some select (very select) portions of the book that were interesting. It moved pretty quickly (a good thing for a bad book) and it reminded me slightly of Ready Player One - in fact, it seemed like Sloan read that glorious book and thought to himself, \\"Hey, I'm going to write a book that follows this plot line, but I'll make it seem original by changing the concept from video games to books - easter eggs to ancient unbroken codes\\". Genius, right? Nope - it just didn't work. The characters were tedious and juvenile. Two of the twenty-something main characters are engaged in this immature middle-school-type relationship that gave me the heeby-jeebies at the slightest mention.<br /><br />Blah. With so many amazing books out there, don't waste your time on this bad boy.

B005LAIIJY|3.0|Tarantino probably had run into some sort of dilemma while writing the script of this film.<br />He could have written a reboot of Spaghetti Western e.g. \\"My Name is Nobody\\".<br />Or a Post-Noir Western e.g. \\"Duel in the Sun\\" or \\"Johnny Guitar\\".<br />Audacious as always, he threw in the untouchable subject matter of American slavery which<br />became the major ingredient that changed the flavor of this film.<br /><br />The result is an overlong, brilliant, daring, funny in parts, catsup-flying violence and mundane<br />in others which resulted a not-very-satisfying Tarantino film.<br /><br />Due to the aforementioned slavery subject, the title character Django played by Jamie Foxx<br />had to remain as a solemn slave turned unlikely super gunslinger instead of an over-the-top Tarantino<br />character we grew to expect or love.  This in turn robbed the viewers of a strong protagonist to<br />root for.<br /><br />Instead  the standouts are Leonardo DiCaprio, Christopher Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson.<br />Christopher Waltz lifted the first part of the film with his engaging acting and the Tarantino dialogue.<br />The strongest part belonged to DiCaprio's southern plantation sequence with Leo giving his meanest<br />and strongest performance to date.<br />Samuel Jackson also gave a strong and funny 'uncle tom' performance.<br />Some of the sequences were overlong/overdone e.g. the clan raid and other many forgettable sequences should<br />have been trimmed.<br /><br />The film lasted about 2hr 30 mins which would be better ended at the standoff after the mayhem<br />at the plantation mansion.<br />Being Tarantino, he didn't want the film to end(it's too early!).<br />He added on the last stretch with his own bloated cameo which broke the momentum of the film and<br />followed by the hero/heroine 'riding off into sunset' after the final (yawn) major destruction.<br /><br />This film had received some negative responses from the African American circles including Spike Lee<br />after its release.<br />This is understandable since it is a painful subject and uncomfortable to watch.<br />However, Tarantino should be applauded for putting the unsavory chapter in the American history on the<br />big screen for the current and future generations to come.<br />after its release.<br />This is understandable since it is a painful subject and uncomfortable to watch.<br />However, Tarantino should be applauded for putting the unsavory chapter in the American history on the<br />big screen for the current and future generations to come.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|If I had known the subject matter I never would of chosen this book.  The story was very depressing and upsetting to me.  I did not like the story.  I read for enjoyment and this book was anything but pleasurable.
B0039TAHMA|3.0|The movie continually paused to catch-up with the download for the first half hour.  I have more than adequate internet, but still frustrating.  Overall a good movie, though a lot more in the books!
B000NVI1IO|3.0|Album is somewhat disappointing.  Not up to AC/DCs usual standards.  They are living off their old reputation rather than putting out a quality product.
030758836X|3.0|The book was okay. There was a lot of suspense leading up to the end, but I didn't think the ending was very good.

B000063DFS|5.0|This is probably Ozzy's best album behind Blizzard of Ozz.  Everything on the album is up tempo, and Zakk Wyldde is phenomenol.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it do much  definite my read this book. You wouldn't want to miss out on the greatest experience Suzanne Collins has ever written!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|In my opinion, it is a mark of genius on behalf of everyone involved with this series that they are able to combine horror and drama in a way that inextricably entwines your emotions with the fate of these characters.  The writing, acting, directing and F/X are all equally sublime.  I never thought I'd find a show to fill the &#34;X Files void&#34; when that series ended, but &#34;Walking Dead&#34; has restored my faith in this genre.  Every time I finish an episode, I lament that I have to wait a whole week to see a new one!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|The great thing is that it has two great games<br />And are in HD<br />brilliant<br />buy it now<br />is fun
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I like S. King but his full tilt horror stuff sort of creeps me out. \\"11-22-63\\" was really pretty fun with just enough eeriness to keep me interested.

B0010SKUYM|2.0|I wish I had been aware that this was written for the teen market before I began.  The main character is certainly full of himself and at times, ridiculously arrogant.<br />It's as if the author had to make him the smartest and wisest and cleverest because the story was so weak.  The author is no GRRM.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love this kind of game; doesn't get boring; really like the soothing sound effects as well; thank you for making it free
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Awesome series. Well worth the price and a great addition to an already popular tv series. The way it was supposed to be.
B009O07NDY|4.0|As with the scores for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Howard Shore creates a soundtrack that becomes an integral part of the movie, The Hobbit. Majestic & soaring themes abound. It is easy to visualize scenes from the movie when listening to the score. Howard Shore's music for Middle Earth will be studied by music students for years to come.
B0051BNRTO|4.0|Not being a huge Hornby fan to begin with, I wasn't expecting very much from Juliet, Naked.  It turned out to be quite entertaining, though.  The characters were interesting, and did illicit some sympathy during the reading.  The atmosphere of boredom and infertile nostalgia in a small English town is well constructed and conveyed, and the imagery used to build it up, I thought, was actually pretty creative.  In general, I didn't think the novel was anything earth-shaking, and it probably won't be one that gets reread every year, or given a place of honor on the shelf.  But if you're looking for a light, slightly silly love story, it doesn't disappoint.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|Thought this would be a fun app but the game freezes all the time. Don't bother downloading this game. Terrible!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|We played Uno a lot when my son was younger.  Sometimes my husband and I play.  It's nice to play even against the computer.
030758836X|4.0|There is so much hype around this book I wasn't sure whether to read it or not.  I often have counter opinions to the hypsters.  However, I did find for the most part I enjoyed this book.  The characters are well thought out and for the most part stay true to their type.<br /><br />The big reveal a little over half-way through was a great revelation and a wonderful bit of storytelling. It made me want to go back and read some of the beginning chapters to see if I could catch or anticipate the twist.  The first few chapters after where the best in the book.<br /><br />After that, it kind of devolved for me.  I wasn't a fan of the finish, but understood it to some degree.  If you want a redemption story, you're not getting it here.  I think there could have been a final twist that would have pushed my rating to a 5 star.<br /><br />Overall - a good read.  I enjoyed everything but the ending.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Ok so once agai adam sandler was right on with this one :) love the crew he picked on this.... want to buy it- and it is funny for kids too, my 3 year old was laughing through out the movie :)
B002K0WBYG|1.0|This was advertised as the movie + a digital copy. I feel mis-lead. No digital copy was included. We will be returning it!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|good movie, nothing bad or good to say about it really....it was a totally bad man movie<br /><br />rent it and watch it, you will see
1592407889|1.0|It's been a long time since I've read a celebrity tell-all book, but I wanted something not too deep and a quick read for the reading on a long haul flight. I persevered to get to the end because I don't like to leave books unfinished. It doesn't flow, it seems padded, and it just isn't that interesting or enlightening or entertaining. I didn't fully believe all of it, and whether I did or not doesn't really matter. It's just someone I don't know about, complaining about someone I've seen in movies. I just finished another tell-all, \\"Beyond Belief\\" by Jenna Miscavige Hill. That is the book I meant to take with me on the plane in the first place, but forgot to pack!  I mention it here because in reflecting upon my two latest reads, I believe that the Hill book was more worthwhile. This book, too, lagged a bit. But the topic involved a wider range of people and seemed more relevant. So if you want to read about someone with a miserable  childhood, try Beyond Belief before this one. She has a more interesting story, and there's no question she truly has something to complain about.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|so we rented the&#34;rated version&#34; and i can't even imagine what the &#34;unrated version&#34; would be like... lots of ............... IT IS NOT FOR KIDS.....i was kinda dissapointed on this one markwahlberg........  I like mark wahlberg, but in movies with not so much sexual/swear words. (sorry)
B009UX2YAC|2.0|What the hell is up with the restart of the games. Every time i make it to 50,000 coins the game restarts. It so annoying takes the fun out of the game.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise. I'm not going to go into detail other than to say that I was not wishing I had only paid $1.25 at the RedBox. I felt the entertainment value was worth more than what I paid to rent it.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|When I first heard that DC Animation was going to be doing what is, in essence, a feature-length animated film out of Frank Miller's historic DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, I was a skeptic. After seeing what Warner Premiere and DC Animation did with Miller's arguably better work BATMAN: YEAR ONE (while being good, it is far from being where it needed to be, quality-wise), I was scared that they would excise too many of the great moments of social satire or cartoon down the violence so that it might be more palatable for a bigger audience.<br /><br />Thankfully, under the perhaps more watchful eyes of director Jay Oliva and DC Animated's mastermind Bruce Timm, both Part 1 and Part 2 of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS are very successful at bringing the comic to animated life. However, Part 2 proved to be even more successful and dynamic of an adaptation than Part 1.<br /><br />The film (as far as both parts are concerned) does benefit making a pretty clear delineation of chapter breaks in connection to its source material. The comic, in its original form, had four issues. Part 1 of TDKR has the first two; entitled \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", showing the aged Bruce Wayne (voiced by Peter Weller) assuming the identity of Batman after a ten-year absence amongst the menace of a gang of sociopathic punks called The Mutants, and \\"The Dark Knight Triumphant\\", which shows Batman gaining a new Robin in young Carrie Kelley (voiced by Ariel Winter) and the defeat of the Mutant's leader.<br /><br />No matter how great those stories may be, it's all still a warm-up for Part 2, which has the real meat of the story as Batman must eventually confront The Joker (voiced by Michael Emerson), who has himself emerged from a 10-year catatonia simply as a response to Batman's return, and also, branded a public menace, he is facing arrest from Gotham City's new police commissioner Ellen Yindel (voiced by Maria Canals, best known to DC Animated fans as the voice of Hawkgirl in the JUSTICE LEAGUE cartoons) since Jim Gordon (voiced by David Selby) reached his mandatory retirement. And then, amidst an ever-changing and volatile political climate, Batman is put directly into the crosshairs of the President, who unleashes Batman's longtime frenemy Superman (voiced by Mark Valley) which will seal Batman's fate and the fate of Gotham City.<br /><br />As with Part 1, the animation is done wonderfully, and has enough of Miller's giant physiques and Lynn Varley's darker coloring to give moments that seem to be lifted right off the page. But the voice of Peter Weller is still a bit of a problem. I felt that he would be perfect to cast as the older Batman/Bruce Wayne, but unfortunately, while not being monotone, there isn't enough emotion behind his voice during really any moment that gives any kind of indication that he feels one way or the other about the events at hand other than through dialogue. Although, it's the presence of Michael Emerson (best known as Benjamin Linus on LOST, or Harold Finch on PERSON OF INTEREST) as the voice of The Joker that ends up more than making up for any lack of passion. His Joker is so incredibly smarmy, viciously cruel, and more than a little love-struck. His personification of The Joker is that of less of a maniacal clown and more of a devilish seducer, waiting for the only person he's ever loved. It's here where one of the major points of Miller's work is seized brilliantly. Conceived not only as a story of Batman's older years, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS is also a deconstruction of the characters portrayed within. The Joker exists because of Batman, and vice versa. They have a symbiotic relationship that far surpasses that of a superhero/supervillain conflict. They are almost interdependent upon each other, which is why The Joker is unable to kill Batman and why Batman, despite the sentiment he feels that he's murdered all of The Joker's victims himself, is also unable to end the omnipresent threat of The Joker with any real finality. Their finalconfrontation is brutal, extremely violent, and extremely unsettling.<br /><br />The finale of the piece comes from a number of angles. A small Latin American country called Corto Maltese is being invaded by Soviet forces (bear in mind, this film takes place at the time that the comic was written in 1986), and while Superman helps to turn the tide of that conflict, the Soviets retaliate with an experimental nuclear weapon that has catastrophic effects for the United States. Gotham City needs a savior, and despite his injuries and being hunted by the law, Batman steps up to lead the city in saving itself. This leads in turn to the climactic confrontation between Batman and Superman. While the fight in the comic does hit the right moments, it's rather brief, and that is certainly not the case in this film. The epic battle between these two titans is extended to give a greater strength, a more visceral thrill, and perhaps even a more emotional punch than what was in the comic. It's by far the highlight of the film from every standpoint. The voice acting from Weller coalesces, and the animation of the fight in all of its superpowered glory is breathtaking. What really makes this scene work, though, is the incredible score provided by Christopher Drake, who has provided the score for just about all of the DC Animated films, and this is by far his most memorable and best work for this company.<br /><br />As I stated in my review for the first of these two animated films, to adapt a work of such depth, nuance, and bravura was something I felt was an impossible task. And while THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS may not give the audience maybe everything it wants from the comic, it gives more than we would have expected, and in some cases, even enhances moments from the original material. This is a bold and mostly excellent adaptation of Miller's seminal work, and deserves to be counted amongst DC Animated's best work, particularly for Part 2. I couldn't really recommend this more highly.<br /><br />As far as extras for the Blu-Ray release of this, it contains two segments regarding the characters; one about the history and rivalry between Batman and Superman and another more about the beginnings and the pathology of The Joker. These segments prove to be extremely well done with a cast of great talking heads such as Denny O'Neil, Grant Morrison, Jerry Robinson (who co-created The Joker), and Michael Uslan, who has been an executive producer of virtually every Batman film or television project since Tim Burton's 1989 film. It also includes a lengthy \\"From Storyboard to Screen\\" segment with commentary by Oliva, three episodes of Batman cartoons (two from the original 1990's animated series and one from the more recent BRAVE AND THE BOLD series) and a brief glimpse at a digital comic version of Miller's source material.<br /><br />All in all, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART 2 is a great release and extremely worthy of any Batman fan's film collection.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 Stars.confrontation is brutal, extremely violent, and extremely unsettling.<br /><br />The finale of the piece comes from a number of angles.

B004FA8NOQ|5.0|I used this processor in a machine I built for my music studio. I also have Skyrim running on the machine. I have not had a single issue with the machine and it is blazing fast. I am very pleased with the performance.
B005LAIIA8|4.0|As per usual, another great Tim Burton film. Of course you have to be a Tim Burton fan to really like his movies. You either love them or hate them it seems there is little in between for his movies.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Very nice and convenient case.  This allows my daughter to use her fire much more easily.  The ability to stand it up is very helpful.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This movie was absolutely wonderful! I had read the book long before the movie came out, and so I was worried that the movie would be so different from the book. It definitely wasn't. Well done!
B007HACDLK|5.0|The only thing I found upsetting were the number of typos and grammatical errors within the kindle version.  Still plan to buy the hardcover version because I have all the rest in hardcover.  The story is action packed from start to finish.  I couldn't put it down.
B004K58GSO|5.0|A John Wayne classic! I remember watching this movie as a kid and I still enjoy watching it. Seeing it in HD<br />adds to the viewing experience. This is a movie not to pass by.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I love the Alien flicks. Ridley Scott is such a genius. And if you can't beat the original, you shouldn't even try. I believe Aliens is everyone's favorite...it certainly is mine. Thank you James Cameron! And as for Alien 3, the &#34;special edition&#34; of this film, is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than the original. NO DYING DOG!!!! that is my only problem with alien 3. being an animal lover, I skip the part when the alien pops out of the dog, because hearing that poor Rottweiler in pain, breaks my heart. the &#34;special edition&#34; changed that scene and I am HAPPPPYYY with it!!!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|If I had a 10 star option I'd give it a 10.  Andrea makes a romantic out of my husband.. and this was no exception
B004S7VQNQ|5.0|Peter Drucker had it right many years ago. This book is still a must read for aspiring executives and those who already hold these lofty positions.
B00153ZC8Q|4.0|it was interesting seeing this movie again after almost 15 years and i liked it. five more words, what for?
B007THA4FI|5.0|I didn't really enjoy reading this as it was depressing and dark, it was a fascinating read. She pinpoints the strata of the classes in the UK and the hypocrisy well. The characters are so well drawn. I wasn't that interested in the teenagers but still you felt such sympathy for them. Excellent book.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great flick, a film that will keep you entertained and on the edge of your seat. Daniel Craig is by far the best 007 of the series. You will not want the movie to end!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Have played this game for years and still enjoy the challenge it provides me!!  Never gets old!!  Recommended for everyone!!
B000HZEE64|5.0|Coach Carter is an excellent film that teaches our teens how to have goals and that it will take hard work to achieve those goals.  It also encourages them to believe in themselves.  Definitely worth watching!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its one of the favorites I have.  Can't seem to pick up the phone without playing at least one game!!  Recommend it to anyone who has a few free moments and wants to get a quick challenge!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very well written and very realistic.  It's a sad topic and yet the author leaves you feeling inspired.  These kids lived a full life in a short time.

B009T3AE1Y|2.0|Robert is a good actor , I am sure he has better roles coming down the pike . He should be more selective . This one's a stinker ....
B009HNDCC4|3.0|The first season was great, the second season was good, the third season was okay- this season - well, maybe they should change the writers?
B005LAIHSG|3.0|She and Rob will have to learn to be more selective about their scripts . Twilight for its great success was followed by bombs , except 'Jake' did rather well in his follow up film - ABDUCTED .
B0090EJR1K|4.0|This Is one of those its so dumb its funny movies. It does not have much substance but its not supposed to it is seriously worth watching if you want a good laugh.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Even though I generally like Mark Wahlberg as an actor, this movie was just totally lame.  Don't waste your time.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Fun<br /><br />Cute little game to play when I'm waiting for the kids to get out of school. Love games like this. Only problem I had is sometimes things are completely hidden behind the top bar. Impossible to find without a clue.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|This movie was a fun remake of the original TV series.  Johnny Depp really can carry an otherwise mediocre movie and make it worth seeing.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Both my 10 year old and 2 year old daughter adore this movie. Great that it can keep both kids entertained, cute story.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|Very well done movie... I particularly enjoy how subtle the movie is on the fact that the character is being unfair to people who love him. When Emile Hirsch's character hears from Keener's character: &#34;Be fair&#34;... he answers: &#34;Give me truth&#34;, quoting a book. She is being honest and bringing a reflection grounded on what he has told her about his life... and he replies by dettaching from actual human contact and refuging in an abstract idea.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Very interesting, quite thought provoking.  I enjoyed reading the book and learning about the characters.  Even the bad guys were likable
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show.my daughter got me watching this show . I found the dialog interesting.people in different countrys are different so I enjoy the change
B0031RS4UM|4.0|As an avid action reader I recommend it to anyone who enjoys fast moving action story. Die trying keeps you in suspense while unfolding the story at a pace that compels you to keep the pages turning.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is your history that you can see how the rest of the world like it. My name is aiden900 and your name is on the rest of the world.<br />Thanks for listening
B000UX6THK|5.0|Twin Peaks is pretty weird but that is what makes it so good. The log lady is pretty scary and I don't particularly like the continuous slow jazz music but the Asian bird is smoking hot. Sizzling hot in fact. Dirty Asian.
0517543052|5.0|I can't say enough about Ram Dass' books.  So honest and sincere.  This man has taught me so much and my gratitude toward him  is immeasurable.  I just Love the way he writes and how open and honest he is about his own life experiences.  What a great teacher.  I wish I knew where to write to him so I could tell him how much he has helped me and how grateful I am.  I Love this man.<br />I believe everyone would benefit from reading this book and all his other ones.  I am so impressed with this person and his writings.  We could ALL learn something from this man's books.  I think it says a lot about Ram Dass that his books have been published for 40 years.  I could go on and on about his wonderful qualities and the importance of his message for humanity..
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|... to what's been written. I only watch this 1 week at a time, so \\"hush\\" to the plot spoilers out there. But I do want to say that Season 3 episode 8 was the best ever! Such great story lines. And to see the evolution of characters -- i.e., us, in our own lives -- was brilliant. This isn't a high-morality show, it's about people finding their footing in a rapidly changing world. For Downton Season 3, that's life in post-WWI Britain. That it all happens with lots of glam, wonderful characters, and period scenes makes the juxtaposition all the better.<br /><br />For those who are new to Downton, it's life in titled, agrarian British culture in the early 1900s. The actors are spot on, the story line can be a bit tedious at times, but the overwhelming beauty and well-portrayed relationships between the haves and have-nots are brilliant. This is seriously good television. (For even better Brit TV: Doc Martin. Best TV series I've ever seen.)
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|The movie has a lot of action and neat effects. I have to say that, in a matter of opinion, the original has a better story line.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great graphics & some scenes are very challenging, which I like. I also think they give you a lot of content for free.
B002M5E2DW|3.0|I thought the book was written in an entertaining manner without logic or experience facts.  i was induced to believe something like this when I was young and very insecure.  It gave me the confidence I needed to lead a successful life, though there were points in my career when I might have been better off without the unfounded confidence that  led me to go out  on a limb..
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|It is time someone calls BS on Bruce Willis.  He has a certain amount of &#34;it&#34; but in this movie even god couldn't make it work.  Save your time and money...forget about it!
B0031RS4UM|4.0|Another great Lee Child read.<br />This one is full of a conspiracy theorists dreams.  Militia, crooked government, military trying to steal our rights and so on.  In the middle of it all, Reacher manages to do all the stuff we have come to know he can do and in the most deadly efficient of ways.  I just read this and bought the next one in the series and kept going.
B008L1F91A|4.0|These new ARTFX Statues are well detailed and they look like their comic book counterpart in the New 52 Comics.  I was a bit worried that they would be more anime looking but there not.<br /><br />Only minor complaint is I wish Kotobukiya would make them limited editions instead of being mass produced.. Would add more value to them as far as collecting goes....
B0031RS2HC|4.0|This is a fast paced thriller designed to be read in one or two sittings and is perfect for a long flight or train trip.  It is probably not for the squeamish as there is graphic violence described in gross detail between the covers.<br /><br />There is no danger the book will win a literary prize but it is certainly not aimed at the avant garde set who judge such things.  It makes no pretences but keeps the reader waiting for the next bloody sequence or carefully thought out conclusion that leads us to the inevitable slaughter at the end.<br /><br />Jack Reacher could never exist in real life but one should not delve too deep into the reasons he is able to do what he does and just enjoy the read for what it is.<br /><br />This was my first Lee Child book and I have since bought four more and realize there are many more to be read.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I like to laugh and she made me laugh.  Reliving the political time and events that made her famous was interesting.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Not quite up to DeMille's usual standard. I did enjoy the fact that he brought together two protagonists from earlier books.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I would give the adventure 5 stars except some of the items are out of view.  I had to use a hint to find them and still did not see them.  Other wise it is fun and pretty quick.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This was a really nice read. One of those books you want to read straight through. I definitely recommend it.
055358202X|4.0|Incredible boks, got it chepa because I'm still reading books versus devices because they giv eme headaches if I stare too long.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I love that Something Borrowed was written from Rachel's point of view and Something Blue is written from Darcy's point of view.  Again, great character crafting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool it's very fun to play I'm pleasant with it good for kids too like me but okay like this game people. Love rebecca
B00499K9E0|5.0|This series just blew me away. I wasn't expecting much... I've always enjoyed the books, have watched the entire 1954 series on Hulu, and never thought a more modern adaptation could be very good. But, wow. Every episode is just a gorgeous movie, and to me, at least, never gets boring. Characters are enjoyable to watch, writing is great, cinematography is awesome, and it's nice that they reference some of the old stories. In addition to all this, if you are a Top Gear UK fan, Watson(Martin Freeman) could easily be Richard Hammond's long lost brother. If you're a Holmes fan, this one is worth checking out.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Somehow this story passed me by until now. My friends told me about it and I had heard his music a long time ago. This is worth seeing!
B008PZYZH6|5.0|This is an awesome movie with an equally awesome cast!  Lot's of action and excitment!!!<br />This movie is always a &#34;go to&#34; for my husband and I...Love the &#34;one-liner's&#34; in this movie!!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As usual I'm impressed with Mr. Lee's writing talent.  His timing and ability are just great.I can't wait for his next book.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This is a great hidden object game. The writing in this game has been greatly improved over the writing in the first game. I like the variety of puzzles and the option to turn off the timer. I also like the ability to read and tap through dialogue quickly. Some items were out of screen a little, and had to use hint to find them. However, this only occurred on my SG3 and not my KF. Playing the game on both devices is good, but I think I'd prefer to play it on my Kindle Fire. Other then that, this game gives you a lengthy amount of entertainment. A must have for hidden objects lovers
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I get tired of waiting for the other person to pick up my picture. I do like to draw, I would like to have more colors, but I have to get more coins for that.
B0084AZXKK|2.0|started out very good. as the plot thickened, the details disappeared, making full comprehension difficult. ending incomplete.<br /><br />started out very
B0063IH60K|5.0|This  is a great game of solitaire. I like being able to move the cards with out using a cursor
B00846F1YW|5.0|Easy to play fun and exciting. I am enjoying the mystery and adventure of it.  Like the different ways to find the objects and the different puzzles.
B0037EAJAC|3.0|The scenery is wonderfull and the grandness of the images is really good.  I just can't stand to see pain and sorrow over and over and over.
B007SGM084|1.0|Don't waste a good mind reading this crap!  Save your money to spend on a prono movie if you have to.
1590171993|4.0|While reading the book I was wondering what made the 2006 edition of the book so successful, while the original edition of 1965 went almost unnoticed.<br /><br />I believe that the reason is the aspirations of the 60's vs. the post trauma of the economic crisis of the year 2000.<br /><br />In the late 60's I graduated from univesity as a technology major. At that time, technology started to rise and we started to read about examples of successful enterpreneurs who made fortunes because of their talent. We believed that success in career and wealth are dependent on the individual. Bright people can get accademic degrees, develop a career in successful companies and become wealthy. People developing routine careers in academia were not an example to admire.<br /><br />In the last decade people got disillussioned. They found that the \\"Wall Street\\" heros manipulated them and the so called \\"successful businessmen\\" are not the characters we want to identify with.<br /><br />So people can now identify themselves with a character like Stoner, which is an \\"anti-hero\\", but despite his mediocre successes, sees mainly the bright side of life. This can turn people into more optimistic when looking backwards at their own life. Younger people who struggle with hard work and competitive life style can identify with someone like Stoner, who wants simple life and small successes.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I found the dialogue to be mind blowing and really funny all the while being very entertaining. I recommend this to anyone that likes a funny mystery.
B0011FTQ4O|5.0|Cumplió con las expectativas , funciona muy bien . Es una película hecho para los amantes del rock  . Estoy muy satisfecho por la Excelencia en la compra
B000084T18|5.0|This is the first CD I had ever purchased and have still yet to be disappointed even 10+ years later. 50 was so good that they played his songs as school dances edited and they were still jams. Easily one of the best albums of all time by one of the best artists.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Will keep watching as many seasons as they can make.  This is the best and most tense show on TV.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter loves this game. She says it cool and fun and would play it for hours if I let her!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Such a good book!! It's the perfect follow up to 50 shades! The characters are very real. I love  how they all have  their own personal issues. It's not as raunchy, Dom/sub type of book. But still good and hoy.
B0040PYVTW|5.0|I love the soulful tracks on this album. Definitely glad I bought it. Would recommend it to some else who loves this style of music.
B006H5120E|5.0|Loved it! the 3D Blue Ray enhanced this great movie. I didn't think I was going to be able to talk my hubby into watching it with me. But once he put on his 3D glasses, kicked back in the recliner, he watched it clear through to the end of the first disc. He couldn't wait to watch part 2, What a guy!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I loved this book and have recommended to many of my friends.  The describtions of the orphanage were disturbing...especially when I read they were based on real experiances.  But I loved the sweet characters AND the wonderful twist at the end.
145470246X|5.0|Absolutely beautiful!. I have made several pieces of jewelry from this beading book. Easy to understand directions and stunning pictures. You won't be dissappointed. Pretty, Pretty, pretty!!!
B0013D6LEM|5.0|Great.The true spirit of Michal Jackson comes out in this album. This is music when he was at his best.
B00867GHS8|5.0|This is my first 3D Blue Ray movie. I have to say we loved it! We will never get tired of watching the 3D in beautiful colors. I'm still amazed and still say wow! everytime I watch it
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I love the Angry Birds Rio game and the additional features which are not available for the same game on my PC.  That being said, the Kindle game is more difficult to play as you can not see the entire screen which makes it difficult to aim at your target.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|My 5 year old is bonkers over this game.  LITTLE DOES SHE REALIZE SHE IS LEARNING.  Really cute characters..... Way to go...
B005IQZB14|4.0|What is it that pulled on my soul as I read this story?  The yearning for independence, solitude, freedom, the quiet of the trail? I have hiked similar areas and the longing to be under the trees and on the mountain was so strong.  But the fear I felt for the author as a woman alone in nature, told me a lot about why such stories entrance me...we are still caged from complete freedom by our physical weakness.  Not just the danger of being harmed physically, but the actual ability to go up against yourself and the trail and survive! To overcome this fear is such freedom!!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Lots of twists and kept us on our toes!<br />Acting was well done. Fast, tempo movie.<br />Good plot and story line
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this APP! The only one of the flaws is you don't get all the stuff on survival as in creative.
B0033VUH6A|5.0|Kathryn Bigelow helps us see the emotional impact of the highly engaged warroir. Compassion mixes with adrenalin and we come to understand the psychological pressure from three perspectives.<br /><br />Remarkable acting, editing, sound, and fx.
6305428352|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over because it is one of my favorite Richard Dreyfuss movies.  I don't want to give too much away and I will leave it at that.  Good story.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|This is one of those albums I need with me on that hypothetical desert island.<br /><br />What more can I say?<br /><br /> Perfection!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Written by a very skillful woman writer, as a male, I don't feel that I can relate to the style. The content is not believable, in much the same way as a &#34;B&#34; grade film is not believable.
0525423656|4.0|This is the second in the series and it's good.  Of course story preference is person by person.  Im 28 and really wish that they had had these young adult stories when I was in my teens.  The book came perfectly packaged.
B0097PW7H8|3.0|I use Juice Defender on my droid phone and it is great about saving battery time. This one is pitiful compared to it but it is not available for fire hd 7in. Very small improvement of battery life.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Hysterical and thoroughly entertaining for all ages, I would highly recommend for families with children six to eight years old.
B00APJLFEG|1.0|Cut out half way through the movie with six grandchildren watching it!  Never got to see the rest - will not pay to watch again!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|So good, I had to buy a digital copy for my Apple TVs (stream from my mac mini server).  No Sci-Fi loving household should be without a digital copy of Serenity (or Firefly for that matter) so that you can convert someone to the Browncoats at a moments notice.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I loved this movie! So very very entertaining and As always Johnny Depp was great. Would highly recommend this movie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Heard about this show for over a year and finally gave it a try.  Good stuff.  Engaging, funny, good acting, and interesting to see how more progressive (according to the show) early turn-of-the 20th century England was that the US is today.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Being a huge Pixar fan, and having a daughter, I figured we would love this movie. But meh. It just didn't blow me away. It wasn't that immersive. It never felt epic. Color, animation, music and acting is great. It's just the culmination wasn't mind-blowing like the rest. Maybe my kid will like it upon review, but for now, not sold.
0740785508|5.0|I am drawn to books that describe different creatures from far away places.  I write the descriptions done on paper and then try to draw them.  How do you approach the correct way to do this.  I found this information in the book.  This book has reenforced the process that I was thinking about.  Read this book and be amazed.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|What an amazing movie! If anyone ever paid $500 a ticket for 3rd row seats like I did, not getting this is a huge mistake. The moment the concert starts, you're there. You can feel the heat from the lights. The crowd's tension is palpable. Everything about this doc is amazing. My wife keeps the soundtrack playing on a loop in her car now. She constantly reminds me it was her best Xmas present.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I've enjoyed this book. It's a sweet romantic read. I've enjoyed the way the author wrote the book sweet with a bit of spice.
B006JRY0Q8|5.0|Good gritty series. Keeps you on the edge of your seat with lots of violence and action yet still is alluring to my wife
B008XG1X18|3.0|I am addicted to Pinterest! So I obviously decided to download the app. I got it on both my Samsung Galaxy Tab, iPhone 4, and later my HTC Rezound.<br /><br />WHEN IT WORKS, it's great! I love browsing on long car rides (when I'm not driving), in waiting rooms... when I should be working. BUT on average, I can only access the app about 60% of the time on all of my devices. I frequently get errors saying a pin can't be found.<br /><br />I've tried using mobile network and wi-fi and uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I still have issues, but it hasn't really stopped me from using the app. I just curse under my breath and then reload for five minutes until it works!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book.  There were parts in the middle that I did not like Eva so much and felt she was over the top with her insecure, attention seeking personality (which I strongly dislike).  But I was extremely pleased with the ending of the book and cannot wait to read the last one!
B000M5NRLC|5.0|This is a go-to favorite in our home year round. We are huge Seuss fans and the way the story is brought to life is extremely impressive. Unlike many other children's books transferred to screen, there is no loss of integrity or huge changes. The special effects make-up is amazing as well! Jim Carrey brings the Grinch to life like no other could with his voices and mannerisms.<br /><br />How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a movie that our family will never outgrow.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Going through withdrawals now that the books are over!  This was a great ending to the series and I cannot wait to read it again.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn puts out consistently dark, emotional suspense novels. Her characters are deep and flawed, but they make sense.  There are no happy endings for the sake of a happy ending, but it's always satisfying and the stories are compelling.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great download for kids and addicting for adults as well. =) For being free it is a great game for the whole family and it has a lot to do.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|The quality of the CDs are great, the cover is nice and the movie is awesome! Great product overall and looks great when played!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love this game. Its  just hard enough to be challenging.  great graphics. love the way the hidden objects have to be assembled on the page before they count. would love more of the same please.
0790731509|5.0|The used DVD looked and plays just like new. It is a great movie and Paul Newman made it great.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|It still has ads which sometimes freeze on the screen!  What exactly does &#34;ad free&#34; mean?? Constantly bombarded with Angry Birds product ads.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|Very enjoyable. Good special effects. Engaging characters. Interesting ideas. I have been &#34;binge&#34; watching on the weekends. Loving it and glad I don't have to wait a week to find out what happens next.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My kids loved it...that is the reason for giving this movie five stars! It was nice to hear them laugh so much! :)
B003OUXECE|5.0|If you have played the Bioshock games this is a must read. I would definitively no read this until you have played the game since it is a spoiler.<br /><br />It is nice to get the information on how and why Rapture was formed. I have read this twice.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book I recommend It to any one who loves army or seals or any thing this book is great!
B0038NN3B4|5.0|As with any diet it really has to be a lifestyle change.  This book I have had now for almost a month.  I love the diet because it is the most affordable diet.  There is no special prepackaged meals or supplements.  It is what it says it is.  With the introduction of &#34;induction&#34; foods you're challenged to create new recipes using some of the same products.  So you don't need a big shopping list - just creativity with very basic food stuff.  The first few week I lost over 20 pounds and I am only 40 pounds overweight so I am half way there.  It works.  It takes dedication, then it takes a gradual lifestyle change in the way one used to consume empty - potentially harmful, processed (refined) carbs.  The online resources and communities are 100% user-friendly, relevant, and useful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it my friend got me into to it and I cant quit playing it .... you should try it
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Decent movie actually. I was skeptical but thought it couldn't be too bad after my have told me about the book. So we gave it a try. I would definitely order again.
B005IQZB14|5.0|The use of profanity and adult themes does not take away from this awesome adventure tale, as Cheryl leads us down the PCT which parallels her life experiences. A must-read for anyone who is a lover of the tranquility only available in the great outdoors!
B00846TTDG|3.0|Good portrayal of the honor of our soldiers but I probably could have skipped this one. I really like the part at the end where the bad guy....JK
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is amazing and fun. wen u get to the cave it gets harder but other than that its easy
B008AK8FHM|5.0|You'll see varying comments from people who do and others who do not believe and/or agree with the story that Dr. Alexander presents in this book and the conclusions that he draws.  It occurs to me that, as a highly accomplished Brain Surgeon, he knows infinitely more about brain activity and function than I ever will (more than the vast majority of his critics, too, I might add).  I for one believe him and I also agree with him.  I am not an avid reader, but I tore through this book in a couple days, I could not put it down and I did not want it to end.  I am eternally grateful to Dr. Alexander for risking his reputation and his livelihood by bringing his story to the public.  I recommend that you read his book and decide for yourself if you believe him.  For me, his story has inspired me and given me hope.  I believe it will do the same for anyone who takes the time to read it.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|this is neat and it's fun challenge and part of the rating was because i don't know if it's what i was looking for or what I was thinking it would be like
B004F1F32A|5.0|This movie is amazing and makes me want to have children (female) and put them in a dangerous situation just to rescue them and be badass like Liam Neeson.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|it's my fav show anyway and love that amazon is so quick with instant video streaming and no commercials, no play back issues and love that it can be downloaded to my kindle
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen, even the nudity, etc. could not hold my attention. Waste of money.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|In a celebrity dazed culture of instant fame, we might be reminded of what it may take to commit a heroic act. Some say heros are ordinary people caught in extraordinary circumstances, who perform heroically. This movie looks at a very flawed human being who is a trained and experienced pilot, who gets caught in an extraordinary circumstance.  The drama often makes you squirm and look into your own strengths and weaknesses. The third act is weak, but the message is loud and clear.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Have not read it yet but sure am excited to see the movie version.  The actors and actresses are awesome.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Inspiring, moving, and life-changing. Anita MoorjanI's story of her near death experience is unforgettable.  Her message - to live your life fearlessly.  There are parts of this book that you will want to read again and again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just finished this book and now am looking forward to seeing the movie.  It is just hitting the theatres in my area so hope to see it soon. I could not put this book down the last 10 chapters.  It gets really exciting.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really liked the story of two tortured souls finding each other to heal. Wish I didn't have t  wait until June for next book.
B0053O89JM|3.0|While the sudden exodus of Lisa Edelstein (Dr. Cuddy) from the cast was a great loss, and the change of cast working directly for House was unexpected, the finale of the show was a great episode, recapping House's emotional past and highlighting his most important relationships-Proof that Wilson really was the most important person in his life-what a sacrifice!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This film needs to be seen more than once. Thee are several things happening at once. It's a masterpiece. Like many great stories it is complex, but its worth deciphering. I think with all the pablum offered, this was too much work for some viewers.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It's so funny!!! I heard a lot from my friends about a capella groups, since there are also three on my campus. It reminded me of my school.  Very funny!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great.but i cant get online.if you dont like it you wasted $7.but it is awesome i recomend this to every one
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I was so shocked by how it turned out that I instantly had to start reading the next. TEAM PEETA :)
B0091THRCU|5.0|Fits the iPhone 5 well. I'm not afraid of it falling out, and I can fit 3 cards in the slot as well. I have some hesitation that the pull tab might wear out quickly, but until it does, I'm giving this 5 stars.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I chose this rating of a four star book because this was filled with excitement, adventure, and romance. This book had my reading every night, and every night I could not find a place tho stop. Finally I would like to say to Rick that this book was all around great, but a little “heads-up\\" would've been nice. Since you ended so abruptly I feel as if I missed out on parts. This was just getting really interesting and BOOM I turn the page to find the glossary. I really enjoy all of your mythological stories and greatly appreciate your work and cannot wait for the fall of 2013.
B008MM9630|5.0|Me and my five year old love games like this. it teaches patience and hard work has it's rewards. great fun way to learn about earning money and such as well.
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|I have just started reading this book and I do not care what age you are, you'll simply adore this book. Superbly written,catches your immediate attention.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was a refreshing and intriguing book written by an Atheist, unique to such a genre.  As a Neurosurgeon, he shared knowledge that was often intriguing to the story line. I have read plenty about near death experiences, and  would recommend this one to the rest of the interesting books I have read through-out the years.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|So far I cannot seem to put it down and when I do, it is because I absolutely have to so that I can get some work done. A well written book and I simply love the characters in this captivating story. I feel like I am right inside of the book watching everything happening. This is a must read and if you love dogs, you will love this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put the book down once I started reading - be ready for some real tears as it tears your heart apart
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Movie was well paced.  Graphics were excellent.  The action sequences were more than worth watching.  All in all a fair movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The lower-level puzzles (9x9 and below) are pretty easy, but the 10x10s and higher can be interesting. for the 12x12s and above, you'll find that there's an elegant solution for every puzzle (not involving single color folds or spirals - you'll get what I mean if you play). Go for the elegant solution. It's worth it when you get it.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This is a very fun movie. If you enjoyed the MIB series than this will not disappoint you.  If you looking for a fun and funny movie look no further.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I was get watching this show again. I saw it when it was on tv the first time. it is still a great program.
B0086700CM|5.0|My nine and seven year olds both downloaded this and TR2.  They have been playing with both for about three weeks now and continue to go back to it.  Pretty good longevity for that age group.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The way the book beguins, the way the writter explain the situations, the feelings and a future world where people is nothing than pieces of a game, meke the reader think deeply about the characters feelings.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Sometimes what is shown on the alerts screen is different than what's on the forecast screen.<br />Other than that ths app is easy to use and easy to navigate.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I already have seen the movie but this book is so much better then the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved it the best ever.
B009K86D86|5.0|Education seems to be what Americans shun.<br />This documentary offers Proof that corporate food manufacturers are complicit in tearing down our overall health in favor of profit.<br />If you desire to search for options in your food choices, this movie is a great start.
B007REV4YI|5.0|skyfall is an okay bond movie. it was filled with action and adventure. overall 5 stars, i will buy this movie in the future
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just like Temple Run games, but with a kid twist to it.  My two kids just love it and play every day.  I think is a cute game and I play it every once in awhile just to spend some time with my kids.  They tell me what to do just to make some money to buy upgrades.  We just love it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|hey this game is ok,but it's for losers who live in their mom's basement. don't play this game,rip off.the graphics are bad ok and good.all around the game is stupid
B000VSYDRM|5.0|Even with so little dialogue, Whishaw is brilliant.  I'll be thinking of Grenouille for a long time.  The story itself was captivating, and the film was cinematically rich and gorgeous.
B003KK6GOQ|4.0|I have recommended this book to a lot of my friends, as I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.'and I found it very hard to put down
B005KELW26|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter. I guess I have to get used to this brave new world, as this is the wave of the future in books. She loves the cover, and says it it a great protection for her Kindle.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|A music review by PJ Cornell.<br /><br />Originally published in the Asterisked Music Journal.  Syndicated by the Transegoist Daily Journal.<br /><br />Overall assessment: 10 out of 10.<br /><br />Bottom line up front: this album is a positively flawless accomplishment on the part of the numetal giant, Shinedown.  If this album doesn't inspire you to take to the streets waving angry signs around, or yelling out of a bullhorn, to tell your family and friends how much you love them, and wake up each morning trying to find new ways to do what others before you only dreamed of doing, then nothing will.  When tyrants and misanthropists go to Hell, they will be forced to listen to this album over and over again, existing with the eternal realization that this is the essence of the human spirit which they tried to suppress and crush.<br /><br />Highlights: The lyrics of these songs are consistently on point.  \\"No one's gonna cry on the very day you die; you're a bully.\\"  \\"You got the world on it's knees, you're taking all that you please; you want more!  But you'll get nothing from me you're like the burden we bear; you're all the hate that we share; you want more!  But you'll get nothing from me but enemies!\\"  \\"So have you ever been caught in a sea of despair, and your moment of truth is the day that you say `I'm not scared?'\\"  \\"I like to stare at the sun and think about what I've done.  I lie awake in my great escape.  I like crossing the line and slowly losing my mind.  Are you ok?  `Cause I feel fine.\\"  Simply amazing.  There is not a single song on this album that isn't excellent, but my personal favorite is I'm not Alright, which is a delightfully and iconoclastic song which takes sharp jabs at the pricks who would like to label anyone with backbone and heart as insane.<br /><br />Criticisms: None.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is that rare album that will actually make you a better person the more you listen to it.  If enjoy rock or metal even a little bit, then I vehemently recommend that you get a hold of a copy of this album.  This is probably the best album in the genre to have been published in 2012.  This is a metal masterpiece.
1582701709|5.0|After 30 years of poverty, destitution, homelessness and desperation, Rhonda Byrne's finally explained to me what was wrong, why it was wrong, and how I could change it! Today, I live a very different, successful life, working, traveling and sharing my story. This book explores the Law of Attraction which is different terminology for the Biblical Principles of Faith. As a Christian, the kingdom principles that God put in place, finally made sense. I was able to put them in place in my life and nothing has been the same since! I have all of her items. Be sure to get the DVD. I made all my kids watch it so they didn't need to suffer like I did.
0061733199|5.0|I was very pleased when I recieved this. If your looking for a all around book this is it... IF your looking for a more in depth knowledge of a specific topic you may want to research that topic. (ie: all poisenous snakes, ect.)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best app ever it has new cool stunts like zip lines.also rivers.the thing that chases you is the big monkey that is one.that's how awesome cool super best supper supper app is you should buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the thriller twist and Jo. The way sparks wrote how the husband thought was fascinating! Couldn't put it down til it was over and it left me wanting more.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Seasons is not only the same fun of regular Angry Birds, but it's also very cute to look at while playing.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|We have been and continue you be ENTHRALLED by this show.. Tremendous storyline as well as Actors that truly embrace their characters.. A must see for anyone who loves being dragged into a story!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Since I love horses I figured I give this game a try.  So far so good.  Graphics are good, it's comparable to Nintendo pets game, you train, feed, bath, compete in shows in order to earn coins,exp, happiness etc, etc....Overall it's a fun way to pass the time.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I would recomend this book for young and old readers.  It seems like your right there in thier moment.  I gave this rating a 4, it was slow in a few places, but otherwise very well written.  Hope there a update on what happens after.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|the story line is awesome.  the zombies are the backdrop but the real story is in how the characters respond to the zombie apocalypse.  a good story should make you really care what happens to the characters.  i believe that the show has excelled on this point.  people really care what happens.  the writers and actors have done an amazing job.<br /><br />keep the episodes coming but please do not kill the whole crew off.<br /><br />the zombies are scary as hell.  this zombie flick has turned into an epic and everyone i know is addicted.<br /><br />Jeff Burns
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two was a very insightful read into this type of inhibition.<br />It was very riveting and very hard to put down.  Probably in a few years I will probably go back and re-read the trilogy.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Every email has an adobe attatched! Everyone should have this on their tablet. seven more words are required required required!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was very sexual and was very hard to put down.<br />You were waiting for the point where he would break-free from his inhibitions.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Love this game. It runs smooth and works on my Kindle fire. Does not freeze up. I play for several hours without restarting evev one time! Makes me happy. I reccommend this game to anyone that likes solving puzzles and finding hidden objects.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I will enjoy playing this game again. The costumes are sumptious. The rooms for the hidden objects are not cartoony. The game held my attention but I did turn off the sounds.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I nearly trashed this book after only a couple of chapters but I persisted and read on. However, it eventually sucked me in like quicksand, actually more like slowsand as the storyline tends to plod along. Personally, I think there's too much detail in Amy's Diary and not enough action. Still as the saying goes...'revenge is a dish best served cold' and if your up for a revenge plodder, this one's for you.<br />The second part of the book: quickened up and became a little more exciting as the two opposing parties went their own ways. Highly unlikely that Amy wouldn't have been recognised hanging out in a downtown motel for ages irrespective of her disguise. Who knows, people tend to see only what they want to see!<br />The final part of the book: the pseudo rescue and being held against her will, followed by Amy's revenge and return to a husband who'd guessed the truth but had to live with it, scary.<br />Slow, scary outcome and definitely not a trash can job.<br />Can't give it more than three stars given its extremely slow start.
B009NCM248|5.0|Definitely worth the 4 dollars I paid for it.  It surpised me how good it was, the samples of the tracks don't do it justice.  what are you waiting for?  buy it!
B004G600A4|5.0|I gave this DVD to my wife as a gift and she loved it.  A very entertaining film.  I got it at a good cost and it shipped very quickly.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I loved this movie,cute,funny & all the singing was awesome.Made you want to get up & sing too:)Britney Snow is getting a bit too old to be playing a college student though but she was great in this movie:)
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I gave this DVD to my wife as a gift and she loved it.  A very entertaining film.  I got it at a good cost and it shipped very quickly.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|I thought this movie was cute.Kate Hudson does a great job making you just wanna B*tch slap her,lol.But a little long in the tooth to be working with these younger actresses & actors.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I gave this DVD to my wife as a gift and she loved it.  A very entertaining film.  I got it at a good cost and it shipped very quickly.
B0025KVLRY|1.0|I specifically bought the &#34;Enhanced&#34; edition that came out in ecopak back in 1999. What did I get?The original issue that I had already purchased years ago. This place is bad news...I would have to pay postage to send it back and then get the right one, which I will NEVER go to again.
B005HEPL8K|5.0|Rented this for my grandkids and they were so deeply involved......I did not hear a peep out of them.  They are looking forward to more episodes.
B0025KVLTW|1.0|Wrong version from this place. Ordered the ecopak &#34;Enhanced&#34; version from 1999 and got the original issue. The pix on the order screen was of the ecopak...never again with this company.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The second season is more fascinating than the first.  You get so involved with not only the residents but also the staff.  Can't wait for season 3!
B0050Q3TDY|4.0|I would recommend this to any jazz lover. Since there is no jazz station in this city on the radio, this app fills that gap.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|its a good app good for when u get bored I would recommend this app for when u get bored and u have nothing else to do
B00646Z09K|5.0|This show has come a long way. The story lines continue to evolve and the characters continue to develop into a very enjoyable Si-Fi show. Sometimes the dinos are a bit laughable, but I am sure they stretch their budget to deliver the very best they can. The acting is much better than I would have expected given the story. If you give this show time to prove itself, you wont be disappointed.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|It was not my &#34;cup of tea&#34;.  Too many details about the Masonic Order.  I found it tiresome reading and little too gory for<br />my taste.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This new game has many upgrades with better graphics and better options.  My son loves playing this new game and we can hardly get him to stop.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this bag it has places to hold everything for my DSLR camera back up camera and all my accessories.  I recommend this bag to anyone not looking to spend a arm and leg for a bag.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|One of the worst books I have ever read, so unrealistic - do not spend your money or time on this book.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book is an honest and thorough examination of the life and career of a Revolutionary. Steve Jobs was an amazing visionary with many demons, and yet he was influential and respected, even by those who disliked him. This book is a must read for any Apple fan. The book is unvarnished truth, and a great accomplishment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I highly recommend this game. It has way better graphics then temple run 1. You need to get this. Okay. So worth 4-5 stars.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I was sucked in from the 1st chapter. Every spare minute I have been engrossed ever since. Now I am a bit sad that I must leave this world and wait for the next book to continue the journey.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|OK, the actual crash is spectacular.  Then follows interminable drinking and drugging and sad facial expressions and...look, my advice is, watch the plane crash and then go do something else.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just when I thought it was a teenage romance book...great book with some great twists. Kudos!<br />Hoover's other book, Slammed, is a very good read also!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|As has been said repeatedly in other reviews, this is a well written, fun read. There are few typos or other mistakes that litter many other inexpensive kindle books, and the author has a good sense of humor, making me laugh out loud on occasion. I happened to buy the book for $.99 and consider it one of the best bargains I've found in a while, and will certainly look for more titles from this author. This book will not disappoint you.
B00821OX98|3.0|I'm not going to go that in depth here, enough other have and its just a tv show.  I found it to be interesting, I tended to want to know what would happen next.  The effects are not what I thought they would be but its a step up from the usual sci-fi channel stuff. Check it out if you like sci-fi  and want something new to watch.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|First of all, this is a great book read just as the story is told.  However, once the ending is revealed, one can read it again in light of the knowledge received, and it's another book entirely!
0312430000|4.0|Atul Gawande writes in what has become a popular style, expert as story-gathering layperson.  It works.  Stories are well chosen to illustrate at length the benefits of planning ahead thoughtfully and deliberately.  If you are already thinking of purchasing it to help you contextualize a work habit or strategy that aligns with Atul's premise, then definitely get it.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love the show.  The characters of Holmes and Watson, though a little off beat, are superb.  The fast action keeps you captivated and I wouldn't miss an episode.  Both actors are wonderful.  And I like the fact that the show takes place in the states and that Holmes in no longer an addict.  The show is a wonderful mix of humor and drama.  Well worth the time to watch.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Begins on an interesting premise, but takes a downward spiral into gratuitous wierdness thereafter.  Question: How does an alien octopus baby, mixed with a humanoid alien make a toothy hammerhead shark alien?  And what does that have to do with anything else in the movie?  The budget for this film would have been better spent on a credible charity.  Don't mucky up your mind with it.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Finding Nemo  is a favorite and I always enjoy the characters. It could frighten children so parents might want to view it ahead of time. We had a Toddler in the room and streamed past some of the more intense scenes. We love being able to view your movies on our Television. Whether it is purchased or a Prime we thank Amazon.com for being a leader in good family fun.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book. I can't say much more. I just love this book. It's a beautiful and tragic novel.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was never one to pick up a book and read, but I love the dog in this book.  He makes me wonder what my dogs are thinking.
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|If you are a Stargate fan, then this movie is a must for you.  When a couple of the team begin to disappear into thin air the remaining team hits the Stargate and end up in a 20th century when the Stargate has not yet been invented.  We have all of our favorite and familiar characters who, of course, go to the North Arctic and Russia to find the frozen Stargate, make things work allowing them to return to their own time and things are made right and all is right with the world.  We watched this as a Prime Member free through our computer/TV 60\\" monitor.  Wonderful.
B004N0I3U2|5.0|The film is great from beginning to end. Always keeping you on the edge of your seat. It makes you laugh, and makes you think.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|We apparently missed most of the movie as we were watching this through our Prime Membership FREE streaming from TV computer on selected movies.  We saw the first very few minutes and then the movie was ending.  All in all I think we saw 23 minutes.  Perhaps it was just a trailer.  We've enjoyed a couple of other movies with no problems.  My husband is checking with how we have things set up but I think this was just a trailer.  It was all Tommy Lee Jones \\"style\\" if you will, my kind of guy.  He's the Slow South Louisiana Law, checking things out, figuring out who did what and why and were they justified.  Knowing when to let things just slide and usually the problem has already taken care of itself.  I \\"think\\" it was a good movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I read it in one sitting.  My first John Green read but not my last!
072325804X|5.0|I was very impressed with the quality of the book cover and case. The artwork inside and out is very beautiful. Beatrix Potter's Tales in their best form.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|My wife loves T&S, so the new CD was a must-buy. However, I heard some reviewers lamenting the &#34;pop&#34; or &#34;electronic&#34; vide on this new CD, and it had me worried. Sure, my wife would like it, but would I suffer while listening along? On the contrary, to me, this still sounds like a Tegan & Sara CD through and through. Meaning songs with personal, clever lyrics, and always more more than depression.<br /><br />While I get what the naysayers mean by the change in tone, this feel like a T&S album done in an 80's style, but they make it their own. It reminded me of the soundtrack of the recent movie Drive; like an homage to another time, but still fitting well in this one.<br /><br />At any rate, I think fans of Tegan & Sara owe it to themselve to just listen to this record before judging its quality. This is still their music, it's still fun, and it makes me move when I hear it? What else do you want from an album? :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Nice selection of games all in 1, wish it didn't cost so many coins to buy each new mini game would have had 5 stars if not for that
B00846WWVM|4.0|Cute game for the little boy in your life especially if he enjoys firemen and fire trucks.. Not too difficult
B001BZRUR4|4.0|I like many others have read The Book Thief and fell in love so I wanted to read more by Markus Zusak so I picked this up.<br />I loved, love The Book Thief and for me this didn't live up to that but it was still a very good book with a really good message. I love Zusak's writing style and he has a way of keeping you wondering where he is going but still interested at the same time.<br />The ending was not bad but it wasn't great either... It fit well enough but I was hoping for a little bit more. This is a book that is worth your time tho and fantastic writing.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome immagery. Intricate story line.<br />I wish I were there with Catniss and everyone else.<br />I wished this series would never stop.
B004G600A4|5.0|Great family movie.  It is a keeper.  You should add on to your library.  The colors in this movie really get your eye.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I'm a Clancy fan from way back & really enjoyed this story. Too close to reality for comfort as a lot of his stuff can be but a real thrill to read.<br />Loved it!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. The movie was good but the book was even better.
B00A46H3J6|4.0|The sound of the 1990's is the Alternative Movement. So many bands attempted to copy Pearl Jam. This is the debut release from the band and has such Great songs like, Even Flow, & Jeremy.<br />Ten is a must have!!!

B004GEB9UQ|3.0|I need to lose weight and this diet really doesn't help in that aspect. It does help me hold my own and maintain my current weight. I do feel better but I still need to take off some pounds. To be honest i do have thyroid disease so weight loss isn't easy.
1936891026|1.0|For me, this book hit home the idea that you can lose a potential sale forever just by saying something that doesn't sit right with the prospect in the beginning of the conversation.<br /><br />On page 26 of The War of Art, Steven Pressfield writes:<br /><br />\\"I once worked as a writer for a big New York ad agency. Our boss used to tell us: Invent a disease. Come up with the disease, he said, and we can sell the cure.\\"<br /><br />That's pretty common marketing speak. Can't think of a good product people need? Invent a problem and offer the solution. Sell it on TV for just $19.95 plus shipping and handling. Operators are standing by.<br /><br />But wait, there's more! Pressfield continues:<br /><br />\\"Attention Deficit Disorder, Seasonal Affect Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder. These aren't diseases, they're marketing ploys. Doctors didn't discover them, copywriters did. Marketing departments did. Drug companies did.\\"<br /><br />Spoken like someone who did not grow up with ADHD and who has never tried to raise a child with ADHD. For that matter, spoken like someone who knows nothing about chemical imbalances and how they can affect a person's life.<br /><br />Why stop at those disorders? Alcoholism isn't real either! It was invented by the 12-step programs to keep people paying for meetings. Just stop drinking! Lactose intolerance? Bah! I drink milk all the time! Quit your belly-aching and order a damn pizza already! Don't let the Lactaid people tell you what to buy!<br /><br />True, America is over-medicated. People think they can stop their perfectly healthy, yet slightly hyper kids from jumping on the furniture by sticking a few pills in their mouths. But that shouldn't invalidate those of us with very real chemical imbalances that \\"normal\\" folks like Steven Pressfield just can't wrap their heads around.<br /><br />So when I read that, after going through hell in all my years of school and never understanding why (because back when I was in school the copywriters, marketing departments, and drug companies hadn't invented ADHD yet), and after 10 years of literally floating from job to job to failed business, until I finally learned about ADHD, what causes it, and how to treat it, Pressfield lost me as a customer.<br /><br />Upon reaching the end of page 26, I put the book down and have had no desire to read on. Call it Resistance if you will, but Resistance has won enough wars that I'm okay with the label.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I reads just like the tv show.  If you like &#34;Castle&#34; on television then you'll like the books.  I'm a fan!!!!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|My 13 year old and I loved it! Very funny, I found it similar to Glee but better. Enjoyed it.
B001J9EHSC|5.0|Fiona Apple is one of the best female vocalists that i know. She has a beautiful voice and great lyrics that I know youll enjoy.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love angry birds and its worth the 99 cents to play, very addictive and time passing. Its good for the whole family
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Though the sets and art direction were fantastic, in an age of hyper realistic shooters, one wonders if Dredd is redundant if not an ironic anachronism.  It's a violent shoot'em up from the beginning to the end with very little breath to evaluate the characters.  The story is well contained and executed though, aside from minor plot problems.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I do a lot of e-bay shopping for this app was very useful to me. I have no complaints or complications from this app
B009G3TNIM|4.0|I love Converge, and this is really 4 and a half stars, but they don't give me that option.  The only reason this isn't 5 stars, is I really need to be in the right mood for Converge in general.  If I'm not, it can be somewhat monotonous, but this is pretty minor.  They are one of the best at what the do, and this album is no exception.
B006OISHGQ|1.0|This is just my opnion but I really didnt like the book and uninstalled it. But everyone is different and has different reading choices

B00881VLCE|5.0|cute and fun. wish it came in harder peice modes though where you zoom in and out to complete pieces of the puzzle maybe a 900pc
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My sister has this on her tablet and she loved it and told me about it so I installed it and fell in love with it. Many things you can do with this app beside just reading the bible. Worth downloading
B00992CF6W|4.0|I still prefer the computer for when i want to mine but if i cant then this is good.  It plays well once you get used to the controls.
B0064T6LV8|1.0|This app was not compatible for my table irulu, so I had to uninstall it. It would of been worth a try if it worked.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Always a good read- I will read this one again. Love his writing- it just pulls you in and captures you.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I had this app for a very long time, I love it then you did an update and it wont work on my irulu tablet anymore. I would gladly reinstall if you could fix the problem

B00AYDC5HY|2.0|Frankenweenie is a movie about young Victor who conducts a science experiment to bring his beloved dog Sparky back to life, only to face unintended consequences.<br /><br />Thinking this was a cartoon aiming for a young audience, I decided to rent and see what it was about. The story is an average one if not a little slow and boring. My biggest issue with this movie is I am not sure what audience it is aiming for. It seems a big scary for young children and not so entertaining for the older ones or even adults. I am not sure I would recommend watching if you have small kids as the imagery might cause nightmares. This movie is typical Tim Burton style as the animation is great but definately not one of his best. Burton fans will like this more than your casual viewers of his works.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|Got here promptly as estimated and as described in the product detail. Thanks, I am very satisfied with my purchase!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|this app allows you to explore different items just as if you are on the computer. I suggest this for all the Amazon Lovers
B00140PK6O|5.0|Many lessons to learn from this series and you must also watch Return To Cranford. Joyfully tells of human interaction involving rich/poor, literate/illiterate, hateful bias, forgiving love and all the while dragging the characters into a new age! Don't start watching unless you have about 4-5 hours because you just can't stop!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was a page turner and an intriguing story.  Everyone I have compared notes with is disappointed with the ending.  I ended the book wanting to know more about how the characters were able to go on and what became of them.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is fun to play and pass the time.  Visually cute.  Some time tricky but not to hard for kids to attempt.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever updates are slow but my brother got is kindle took away because he bought a Buch of crape for a game so multiplayer is not that fun
B008476HBM|5.0|Read this and many of Jane Austen's other novels as a teenagers.  Downloaded this on to my new kindle and was as enchanted as the first time I read it.  A classic romantic novel with exquisite characters and reflections on the way of life of that time. Timeless and a must read for the sad romantics amoungst us.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Loved this movie in theater - going to love watching it anywhere I want now!<br /><br />I pre-ordered from Amazon and just received it today.  Here's what's included:<br /><br />Disc 1 = Blu-ray HD movie & special features<br />Disc 2 = DVD SD movie & digital copy for transfer to iTunes (SD copy for itunes)<br />Other = Ultraviolet stream/download \\"copy\\" - (how I get it onto my Kindle Fire HD)<br /><br />Both the iTunes transfer and Ultraviolet copy require the same redemption code included, but you can get both copies if you so desire.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game. Love the graphics. Definitely fun for any one how love horses and video games. And the great thing is that its free.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|People sometimes forget the evils in the world. Lives become to busy to worry about it. This book reminded me of how wonderful and precious life really is, and how there is so much wrong going on in the world. I think every mother should read this and remember  how precious our children really are in this world.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I was going to rate it 5/5. But then I fell threw the floor also I sometimes can walk on air

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent! I enjoyed this series so much I read it twice. The author did an amazing job bringing these characters and their surroundings to life.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|Josh never diassappoints. His tenor voice is terrific and I love the emotion he shows when he sings. Great new album
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Nice way to keep up with social media on the run. I love it and use it often. I'd reccomend it
B0046ECFRM|5.0|You too will fall a little bit in love with Etienne St. Clair. Funny, witty, and nothing is rushed or perfect which made it feel a little more real. Anna is instantly likable, even when she's being frustrating. The first page hooked me. It's funny and the voice is captivating. Perkins' other novel, Lola and the Boy Next Door, was instantly added to my TBR pile.
B00B01XDTI|1.0|It's when you ponder successful franchises like Saw and Paranormal Activity and what they did for the horror thriller genre that you find yourself disgusted in the lazy, lackluster approach to the creation of pieces like this. Everything from the unmotivated actions of characters who barely know each other to the impossible task of suspending disbelief in the flimsy plot disappoints. The first Silent Hill was at least thrilling and new. nothing here surprises or even entertainments and it would be my recommendation to give this a wide birth... not even worth the $3.99 rental price. Horror fans scatter!
B000IDEQTK|5.0|Enjoyed this story.  LIked the raport between the older actors, believeable.<br />Loved the era.  Ended well.  Glad I chose the movie.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I like to play the game and I also like to make designs with the colors.<br />I like to cover up the entire board. 8 yr old girl
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love how this book makes your mind twist and turn around the story line. Great book, a &#34;don't bother me now, i'm reading my book&#34; type of read.
0811876373|5.0|I gave this as a gift to a friend I purchased a cake pop machine for.  She and her children have a blast following the decorative ideas.  Every holiday has us receiving really fun cake pops as gifts.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved this series, but the ending left you needing closure.  I was disappointed in the third book, especially the ending, but I would still recommend reading the series.  She takes you on a wild ride.
6305428042|5.0|This has been a family favorite for many years.  My children are now showing it to their own children so we had to have another copy.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a very good book for people who like army type of stuff. I really enjoyed this book. I encourage other people to dead this book.
B005HSL626|4.0|I liked this game on my phone and was shocked when I saw it in an arcade. Now I have the app from kindle and the videos of my mother and daughter playing mean even more. I really like this game. Check out the parody on youtube.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I think it's a fairly good app.<br />Could use only a couple of things to make it easier, or it could just be simple ramblings from a person more used to using apple products.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This reads well, and I have absolutely no problems with it. It's great!  It's a thought-provoking book that I am enjoying immensely.
1423140605|5.0|Full of action and humor.  Want to read next one, especially after cliff-hanger.  Great for intermediate grades.  My sons are 10 and 13 and both loved it.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great. I'm really just getting the hang of it. I hope to get good enough to get to the end some day.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Having trouble getting it to come up on screen and getting the city I want. Not sure how to delete it.
B009329Y30|4.0|Similar to your other romance 3 party movies; 1 bad guy, two fallen lovers can't be together etc.  However as far as Nicolas Sparks goes and I like his books a lot it was not, better than some, not all.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I choose this rating for the book for the great description. I felt like I would never ever stop reading it. When the book ended I was excited yet sad. I liked actually change that to LOVE this book there is nothing I don't like about it. I would recommend this to all people who have read the two other books.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a fantastic game.  The randomization ensures a fun, unique experience each time, and it has a great combination of strategy and luck.  It's definitely something I'm glad I bought.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|The landscape of Stalinist Russian presents a grim background for a troubled hero on the trail of a serial killer.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Hollywood finally tackles something of value ...the entire movie was so straight on honest regards the somewhat untouchable subject matter it has me rejoycing
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|These are actors that I will continue to look at in whatever movie they star in.  The shy country boy turned into a ruthless vengeful killer by his older brother is powerfully portrayed by LaBeouf.  Hardy as the cold blooded killer defending his family and his means of support is focused solely on his mere presence, but his dialogue makes you like this dark figure he portrays almost as if he is a piece of Hardy's true nature.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an awesome adventure game that I love!  this I think would get everyones interest<br />!! nothing would make me not love temple run nothing I say nothing!!!!
B009ZM74F8|5.0|A World with this actor Christian Bale is truly a blessing to the movies.  His face shows the slightest of emotions and is immediately calculatingly electric and dramatic.  I enjoyed this movie that purchasing was a no brainer.  The ending final fight with his co-worker was a little to short.  like the killing of Darth Maul in Star wars.  Like What was that.  Just too quick.  But The movie over all is worth a few watches like Fahrenheit 145 and Brazil.  A true New World Order type of Movie.
B0017TWUZG|5.0|now I have all the 4 movies of Step Up! My wife really love this movies, so we decide to get all of them
B004LWZW24|4.0|\\"Insidious\\" starts off looking and feeling like a 70s vintage horror movie, in all the right ways.  Starting off reminiscent of \\"Amityville Horror,\\" but better, it shifts tone to be more like \\"The Exorcist\\" later; still, it remains its own movie.  Director James Wan isn't afraid to set the camera down and let it run - not to the extent of a David Lynch, but still, after years of shakycam it's a welcome relief.  Further, it enhances the tension, because the lack of motion or cutting in some scenes makes you wonder what, if anything, is going to move on the screen.<br /><br />Toward the end of the second act, suddenly a team like the Lone Gunmen from X-Files, by way of Ghost Hunters, shows up.  While jarring at first, it's just off kilter enough to work and to be effective.  Tension and horror is built up effectively.  Then, the ending, however, knocks off an entire star; almost two.  I won't spoil it, but suffice it to say it left me simultaneously laughing, angry and scratching my head.  Please, filmmakers, stop it with the badly-thought-out \\"twist\\" just to have a twist.  (I'm looking at you, \\"Battlestar Galactica,\\" as well as this movie.)<br /><br />It's not a spoiler to say that, at the end, an overly-dramatic title card for \\"INSIDIOUS\\"! comes up with a way over the top music stinger, causing me to laugh far more than be horrified.<br /><br />Still, despite its flaws, it's an effective and entertaining horror film, which proves that James Wan is more than a guy who got lucky with \\"Saw.\\"  It's at least worth a rent.
B004529NLG|5.0|now I have all the 4 movies of Step Up! My wife really love this movies, so we decide to get all of them
0525423281|5.0|It took awhile for me to get around to this book, mostly because while I wanted to read it when it came out, I wasn't willing to pay $11 for the ebook. Finally I got it from the library and...<br /><br />I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE it.<br /><br />I might be in the minority who liked this one a LOT more than Anna and the French Kiss. While I liked Anna, I just didn't connect with Etienne at all.<br /><br />NOT so here!<br /><br />I LOVE Lola. And I LOVE Cricket (except for his name, ugh). I think I connect so well with Cricket because he's exactly the kind of guy I would go for in real life. Slightly nerdy, socially awkward, sweet as pie.<br /><br />Lola is this crazy, quirky girl who is trying to figure herself out. I love her crazy outfits and overall weirdness. I thought the whole talking to the moon thing was over the top, but whatever. I just skimmed that part.<br /><br />Max disappointed me. :( However, his reaction was probably pretty realistic. Considering how much I loved him at the start of the novel, I was so sad to see him turn in to such a dbag. I knew things would go horribly wrong with him and Lola, but jeez. Bad Max. Bad.<br /><br />My only real issue was that I wished we got to delve in to Calliope a little more. I found her really interesting, despite her being the generic mean girl throughout most of the book.<br /><br />I love Stephanie Perkins. I love how her characters are always so different, but so real. It's going to be hard to wait on a library copy of Isla, but I still refuse to pay that much for an e-book. :
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is top dog! I mean like Omg like omg! Poodaloo!! Why is my monkey dancing in the shower?
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|We watched this movie without reading anything about it so the first viewing was able to speak for itself and it definitely created a very special ambience that was far out of the ordinary.<br /><br />At first the movie seems choppy as it jumps around between stories but then gradually the pieces are all pulled together to form a very provocative storyline that is significantly different. This is a movie that will leave a lasting impression; whether that impression will be favorable or unfavorable is going to depend on the viewer's perspective.<br /><br />This is definitely one I would suggest renting first and see how it affects you.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|if you like horses this game is pretty cool. I like how the horse actualluy looks some what real, unlike other games where the horse looks and acts fake.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is the second season of a quality production.  I am actually watching season three now and have immensely enjoyed the drama of the Crowley family.  If you enjoy such productions as the Jane Austin movies or upstairs, downstairs, this is a must see.  I have been surprised how many men have gotten involved with this series also.  If you are now sure about buying the whole set, I suggest you try one downloaded copy of an episode.  I am sure you will be hooked!
B002SJKWZ4|3.0|I bought it as a novelty gift and didn't expect much from it other than to work, which it does. I think it's ridiculous BUT since I wasn't buying it for me and was buying it for a Harry Potter fan it was a great gift and well received. Doesn't hurt that it actually worked too.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Excellent game,great story<br />Puzzles are not to easy and not to hard<br />Good graphics, can't wait to play the sequel<br /><br />Good time play
B000GWE44U|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Kept watching over and over again when it came on tv over Christmas.  Really needed to be able t watch it any time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the graphics of this site and now to put my items on my kindle is just great.  Would recommend to those who travel and need ideas from home.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Needed this as 2 just came out and you need the set.  This was just as good as when it first came outl.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Just the right amount of information for traveling weather and those winter days in strange airports! Would recommend to those travelers.
B00177YA1K|5.0|I had 2 and 3 and just wanted to complete my collection.  I don't have to tell anyone how great this is.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked this book as well as the first book!  Great twist that was unexpected. Keep up the good work Suzanne
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Saw this when it came out in theatres and was determined to own it.  This, Batman, Spiderman, Men in Black...
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Not as great as I heard it was!!  A couple of weeks after I recieved the case, the flap that covers the charger slot broke off.  Wasted that money!!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|\\"Loved this book\\" is not adequate to describe this masterpiece of literature.  There was so much imagery that at times I had to make myself re-read a passage because I just knew there was more to be gained! I more than recommend this book for any age, any gender. All you need to enjoy this book is a willingness to let go.......Thank you Ms. Morgenstern, it has been an honor.
0439023513|4.0|The only reason to not like this book is simply because it is the last in the series. I for one have read this book (along with its predecessors The Hunger Games and Catching Fire) three times now, and no matter how many times I read them, I cannot put them down. This is definitely one of my favorite series, and this book will take you on a ride with unexpected twists and surprises. Warning: may cause loss of sleep because you will not want to put it down!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Totally enjoyed this book. Loved it from start to finish. The concept was intriguing. The characters believable and interesting. Highly recommend this book especially if you grew up during the Kennedy presidency.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this app is a very good app to play. I like that this app doesn't have to have WI-FI. I like this game because it teaches how to take care of a horse. Also this app teaches us the responsabilaties<br />of taking care of a horse.
B007Y36K46|4.0|This Disney film is much better than most of the super-hero movies that now clog the movie screens of today. The plot is thin, but the special effects are good. I got a little lost in the explications of how a 19th-century explorer ends up on Mars, and the ending left me a little confused, too. No matter. Most of the movie is quite fun to look at. The love story at the core is very PG-rated, per Disney. This cost millions to make, and I guess it didn't make it back at the box office. Too bad because there is quality here.
B00AUA67GQ|3.0|After using the app for several days, it crashed.<br />Upon opening app, it requested a reinstall.<br />All created notes were lost.<br /><br />Since reinstall, app appears to be running smoothly, but I no longer trust it for critical functions. :(
B0086700CM|5.0|A very addicting game for adults and kids.  My girls love this game and great hand eye coordination for kids.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome just what I was looking for it's actually quite like taking care of a horse it's awesome because it doesn't cost money like real horses and farms do
B0028IDXDS|5.0|So cute, my nephew took to it right away. Also easy to find if dropped.  Would definitely buy one again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is without a doubt the best series I have ever watched!  I do hope they make many more seasons!!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I give it 4 stars for the acting...which was supurb, as well as the content. Who ever was brave enough to bring to life such a contriversial topic  - done in such good taste - thumbs up!<br /><br />Anyone that is easily offended or closed minded - stear clear. But those that have an open mind and are thoughtful - it is a beautiful, unusual love story{s}.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|You can't help but fall in love with each and every character.  It's so entertaining and keeps you wanting more.  I absolutely love Downton Abbey and all it's people.  I do hope they make many more seasons!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I chose this rating because I can't tear myself away and I LOVE Jessica Lang.. The only negative is it is so alarming it is difficult to watch back to back episodes. It's better in small doses.
0060005688|5.0|Everyone should read this. Research on our thinking reveals things we didn't even know affected our happiness with our decisions. Insightful, interesting, and fun; can be a real conversation starter.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|Love this show. I needed to 'catch up'.  But the streaming was absolutely terrible!  Many of the shows I have watched on Prime, the streaming has been terrible.
B00846F1YW|4.0|fun game<br />enjoyable and interesting. a good mind exercise.  It seemed easier than the first one but maybe I just got better.  I would like to see more of this type game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me interested all the way through. I don't want to call it a mystery because it didn't really read that way. (which for me is good, I'm not a big mystery fan) The book did keep you questioning, and wanting more all the time, and the characters were believable enough to handle the sometimes bizarre twists. That is, until the very end. I was slightly dissapointed, and found the end not to be as easy to accept as the rest of the book. I don't want to spoil anything here so that's all I can say, but still I thought it was a worthwhile read, just not a 5 star.
B007HW3CN6|5.0|I purchased this for my grandson, and he absolutely loves the book.  He read the first installation in high school English last year and really enjoyed it, so naturally, the second installment was a no-brainer.  He has been reading it only a short time (like about 1 week) and has only 30 pages to go!  He thinks it is a great book.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, actually laughed out loud a number of times! The main character, a man turning 100, runs away from his old folks home and gets in all sorts of situations that he handles without fluster. The bulk of the book is the telling of his life stories, where he meets important political leaders all the time, and manages to make some sort of impact or mark upon the world. It reminded me a lot of Forest Gump, and I would not hesitate to recommend this book. It was a great pick for my recent cruise- not a deep thoughts sort of read, but a great entertainer!
B009FZFONO|5.0|The third season has a great story line. It is a gory show, but if you can handle it, it is super exciting.
B009AMANBA|5.0|The reviewer who used an episode of \\"Star Trek\\" (a show I like) as his point of comparison with \\"Lincoln\\" is clearly out of his league in attempting to understand and appreciate a work of historical fiction (a genre I rarely like) as complex, well written, well appointed, and well acted as this film which ranks as one of the finest I've seen in 35 years of compulsive film-watching. Not everybody is equipped to like everything excellent.  For one thing, it helps in the case of historical fiction to know something substantial about the subject beforehand.<br /><br />Sally Field ( an actress I rarely warm to) gives what is perhaps a career defining performance as Mary Todd Lincoln. Anyone who doubts this, read ANY three biographies of this troubled historical figure, then tell me Field overacted or just played herself.  If you think the latter, then you probably know neither the subject nor the intepreter very well.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis, perhaps the finest actor of his generation, may well be remembered more for his flawless portrayal here than for any of the always splendid other work he has done to date. But you must really know Lincoln the historical figure to appreciate fully what Day-Lewis achieves.<br /><br />The distillation of one of the most multi-faceted, intrigue-and-manipulation frought political battles in the history of the republic (the passing of the 13th Amendment) into something undersdtandable, and exciting if you paid attention or had any feeling for what was at stake, was an achievement of the greatest film-making and story-telling on its own.<br /><br />A review, I think, should be more than an opinion of how you felt about something.  It should be a composite of what you know about the subject, what you've learned about the genre, and what anyone with the expertise, focus, and attention required may learn and take away from the work being examined.<br /><br />I have disliked great films (\\"The Searchers\\") and been very much taken with somethat were merely mediocre (\\"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\\") but I have never confused the intrisic value of the two with my enjoyment of them. The critical distance shouild be paramount in the critical process.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|yes we love this film in 3D it is just too bad it did not include the family audio. To cut out all of the obscene words.<br />Good buy and delivered in excellent condition.<br /><br />Thank you
1401322336|5.0|This book has helped me understand cooking in a whole diferente way. I have made several recepies following these easy steps and my guests have loved the result! I higly recommend it.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I had always heard of the movie, but had never seen it until my son started watching it and is hooked on it. It's great trying to guess the voices behind the characters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great start of the series and well on the way to becoming a classic.  Must read before seeing the movie as it really does a much better job of building the characters and explaining the situation.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly is one of the best TV shows ever created, its a damn shame Fox screwed it so bad, playing it out of order and then canceling it before it even finished the season.
B002RNOS3I|1.0|The one star rating is directed more towards myself for not knowing that there are different format DVD's and Blu-Rays configured for Regions A,B and C. If you purchase a Region B format it will not play here in the US or Canada for that matter. Yes I saw the &#34;Non USA Format info but thought it had  to do with how it would appear on the screen not with playability. I'm sure there are some out there reading this going &#34;what a moron&#34;! Truth is I'm more &#34;off&#34; than &#34;on&#34; in this case and chances are there are some out there who have done as I have done and just assumed this Region stuff was nothing to be concerned with. With that being said this is directed to anyone else out there to whom this might be news to. You can go online and find the info you need to make an informed purchase, especially if buying from an overseas vendor. There are players out there that are classified as universal units that should play any disc regardless of region but from some of the comments I've read that is not always the case.<br />Anyway, I'm really disappointed that I can't share this wonderful movie with my diving friends here in Texas as the rights have yet to be released here. I think I can get a regular DVD in French with English Subtitles but some of my friends are still hooked into that old &#34;Freedom Fries&#34; boondoggle from a few years back so it probably would not be a good idea...<br />As for the movie itself, I saw it many years ago when living in Montreal (in French) and still have flashbacks of the wonderful imagery, superb sound track etc etc etc...<br />As a side note I was offered a full refund, minus shipping, handling and a 20% restocking fee but have decided to keep it and look into a universal player as my girlfriend and I are big fans of foreign films and we will undoubtedly run into this situation again.<br /> I was once told that if you learn something new you can go home... so I am going to do that and perchance watch something onmy new blu-ray,... formatted for region A of course:)... cheers!
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Did not work with my Kindle Fire HD.  I receive .pdf files via email and when I attempt to read them on my Kindle Fire HD, they cannot be opened.  The downloaded reader did not help.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I know it says &#34;Highlights from the Motion Picture&#34; but boy do they really mean &#34;highlights.&#34; A lot of songs are missing and I know they can't put the whole movie on a CD, but there were a lot of important songs to the story that didn't make it, and there were a few songs that didn't really need to be on the CD. But if you love the movie, the musical, and the music, you'll really love the CD. I listen to it all day every day LOL.
B00A757EFW|4.0|If you like the original, this is an easy, FREE, game for you!  Children love it too, definitely worth the price, LOL
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My son showed me this game and I have to say it is quite fun.  I am at a level now that is very challenging, but after numerous attempts, it is nice to see it complete and move to the next level.
B008WZHWCE|2.0|The story line is as simple as the title.. the circle of life.  It bounces between all of the characters lives and how they intertwine. Not one I would add to my personal collection.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have this on my computer and was so excited to see it when it was available for Kindle.  As you gain more levels, the challenges and finding objects seems to become harder, which I enjoy.
B006YC74E8|4.0|Instagram (free) doesn't work on my Kindle Fire HD.  This app is as close as I can get with the features.  Definitely a keeper.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It is okay.  I just do not see the challenge that I expect with certain games.  It is great when I am tired and do not have to think, but beyond that I give it a so-so rating.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app! Easy to use and great for when I forget my bible. Like all the options it has. Thanks
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My 5 year-old likes to play this.  It is right up her alley with &#34;dress up&#34;.  She comes up with some crazy hair styles!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love this app!! Use it everyday and anywhere I can't use my actual kindle. Does everything the kindle does! Perfect
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|Simple, but works--it is well padded and protects the Kindle.  I like to use the Kindle without a cover, so this works well.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best period series ever--for me however I must give credit to the original Upstairs Downstairs that created the genre and platform for the writing of the story of the class driven society
B0054JZC6E|5.0|bad ass game its a lot of fun I play it every day all day long can not get enough of it
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I have really enjoyed the series.  However, the story line does not hold true to how things REALLY were in the early 20th century concerning homosexual behavior. Thomas would have really been imprisoned and not promoted.  Though I understand wanting to relate to society today, the story line does not hold true to that time in history.  It wasn't really until the 1980s that the homosexual lifestyle was more accepted. And even, then, it's only been in the last 15 years that it's become less of an inigma in society.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|great movie on the Tuskeegee Airmen, great action, can show my older kids...  just seem too short of a movie; I wanted more.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I have seen all of fhese movies before and I was still blown away. These movies are the perfect addition to a home theater. Ass kicking at its finest.
B005MSD6QU|5.0|The show is well written and the cast is terrific and colorful, diverse.  I love watching this type of crime show that takes you through the case solving process.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I saw the show in Vegas and had to purchase this CD.  I've listened to it at least 50 times.
B007SGM084|2.0|This is an OK read, but kind of ridiculous.  As for the &#34;erotica&#34; it is pretty vanilla.  Anne Rice is a much better writer and makes her characters very believable and human ex- Exit to Eden.
B008J34466|5.0|Excellent. Not one song that isn't a pleasure to listen to. Beam Me Up caught me by surprise... I lost a son several years ago and the song floored me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a fantastic website. I love that you can get fitness tips, beauty tips, recipes, makeup tips, and etc.  This site has it all and I highly recommend to anyone and everyone!!!
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I used to have all the free workout apps installed separately. Having them all in one is so convenient! I am considering shelling out the $3.99 for the full app!
B004SBX112|4.0|This game is lots of fun but can also be very frustrating trying to kill the pigs. This game is very time consuming.
B0015AARJI|2.0|like the less gloss finish on this but after 7 months of use its left analog has started sticking my older 4 year controller that still works but battery was dieing got the new battery outa of this new controller
0765325950|5.0|An excellent wrap up of the wheel of time saga. I have yet to remember a character left at loose ends.<br /><br /> I have the whole series in hardback from SFBC and only this one had the binding fall apart. Will pay twice to get a good binding.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is very similar to the movie, &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; and I thought it was very well written.  It's hard to put down once you get into it.  I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books and love them all.  He is definitely one of my favorite authors.  I love that all of his stories are based in small towns in NC, where I am from.  I can't wait for tis movie to be released on Valentine's Day!
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|I am sorry, but it did not hold my interest.  Sweet story but pretty boring. I found myself putting the book down a lot.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Great app.  Quick connection and easy to find on the Kindle. I am used to quick response electronic apps and this works well
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I am not much of a game player.  This is my first experience.  I am still learning the game.  I do like it and am getting better.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my gameloft id is.  rizzlerazzleno1 please add me!!!  I need friends! !!  I'm. playing free... takes time &amp; would like to get some hearts from friends but notice it's. tough to find any!!! they need a gaming community to add friends from a list or something.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Its great for the whole family. I can watch it again and again. It is different then most movies. My son so enjoyed it!
B0094K1QR8|4.0|This was a cute movie, I enjoyed watching it.  It wasn't the best movie I have ever seen but it was better than okay.  It has many scenes that you would not want innocent eyes to watch.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|we enjoyed them, I do hope they come out with more............... They need to bring him back til the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Anyone who likes period dramas will fall in love with these characters. I'm not happy with the ending, but it adds to the drama!
B00865P3AS|3.0|I loved their first CD and their cello treatment of pop and rock songs.  I was disappointed about all the singers and Steve Vai guitar taking precedence over their cello playing on this second CD.  It's an okay CD but not like their first.
B005PK553C|2.0|This is just a weird show...like they are trying to be deep and cutting edge and it just comes off akward. Season 1 is better than season 2 though.
B008G12ERC|4.0|The 2nd Law, not what you would entirely expect from a follow up to their last album Resistance. The sounds are very similar in a lot of songs, but the beat is entirely different, they do this every new album introducing a new beat and giving a different vibe. The 2nd Law has its flaws mainly in the form of Liquid State and Save Me (2 songs which I think are entirely skip-able) but songs like Follow Me, Panic Station and Madness really make up for the crap of the other 2 songs. I really love Unsustainable as a beat/remix song and has an excellent flow.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Good good good..... So ready for the next book....want to know what happens next...<br />June will not get here soon enough
1594487154|4.0|A very helpful book. Pink explains how all of us are now in sales in some way or another; we spend a good portion of our day convincing others of something or other. He tells us first how we are sales, why you are naturally good at selling, and than how to improve. Read this book and gain an edge.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The characters from the first book evolved in interesting ways and their children are now poised for the third book. I was somewhat disappointed that the Holocaust was barely referenced.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Has its silly moments, but if you're looking for an action packed movie you can watch on your HD Screen and crank up your home theater to, it will not disappoint. It's not as bad as critics labeled it. Some you watch for the plot, some you just watch to hear and see things explode. This is the latter.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I use my Jorte calendar to put my scheduled medicines in and the sound scheduler lite to remind me.  If you use copy or paste functions, do not delete the information on the day past or it will delete it forward.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|This movie is senseless and boring. It's just wrong to have trailers and publicity that mislead people into thinking the movie would have some good car chases or anything of the sort. This is worst than watching the mail truck race the ice cream truck. The main character is a brainless confused moron. It's just a horrible Film.

B007REV4T8|5.0|\\"Skyfall\\" is the first James Bond Film to be Directed by an Oscar Winning Director. As a director Sam Mendes has a track record of getting actors to deliver incredible performances (American Beauty, Revolutionary Road, Road to Perdition)and he does it again in \\"Skyfall\\". Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, and Javier Bardem are in top form and the story keeps your attention from begining to end. A great film!
B001GCUNYO|3.0|Never go to Europe. Never! It's pretty much a foregone conclusion that you'll be groomed and sold into sex slavery the literal second you step off the plane. Paris in particular is swarming with prozzies and greasy crooks from some former Soviet block hellhole who kidnap pretty young girls, hook them on drugs, and sell them to morbidly obese Sultans while setting-up sex cabins on building sites, holding sex eBays in the basements of upper class parties, and living in all-male rape communes with the proceeds from their unscrupulous businesses being kept in a coffee can on the kitchen shelf.<br /><br />And producer/director Luc Besson and Pierre Morel are French too, so they know what they are talking about. Liam Neeson knows it too, but his sullen ex-wife believes the world to be full of sunshine and candy and has no problem with sending their unnaturally juvenile 17-year-old daughter off to Paris with her slut best friend. Just as daddy predicted, the dirty foreign animals grab her and hoist her away for auction.<br /><br />Luckily for daddy he has a very particular set of skills that make him a nightmare for foreigners and he goes off to Paris to raise hell. The detective element is played down, down, down (Neeson collects hair samples for no particular reason, never bothers to hide his accent) and the merciless xenophobia is cranked up, up, up. It's not much different from Death Wish in that the crimes established in the first act are merely there to justify the sadism that follows.<br /><br />The film is not that vivid however. Had it been made in the 80s I am sure that the violence would be visceral and effective, but in the post-Bourne world it's shot and cut in a way where you can't really see anything, regardless of which version you are watching.<br /><br />The material is thin, the action is only slightly above tepid, and the killing never really goes beyond gunplay. Taken was a huge, surprise hit when released in the US in early 2009 (several months after its European release) and seemed to naturally tap into America's distrust of other nations and hunger for killing.<br /><br />If you want to take the movie's advice then it's best to stay on US soil, where no one has ever been the victim of violence.<br /><br />The Blu-ray features a nice 2.35:1 1080p picture with DTS HD-MA sound and a small amount of features.its European release) and seemed to naturally tap into America's distrust of other nations and hunger for killing.<br /><br />If you want to take the movie's advice then it's best to stay on US soil, where no one has ever been the victim of violence.<br /><br />The Blu-ray features a nice 2.35:1 1080p picture with DTS HD-MA sound and a small amount of features.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo is a fun and entertaining film to watch. The cast of talented actors create characters that are easy to relate with and as a viewer you want to see them prevail in what seems to be a no win situation. Ben Affleck is establishing himself as one of the best film directors of his time with \\"The Town\\" and \\"Argo\\", can't wait to see his next film.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|Everyone know Victor Hugo gets long winded and some parts of this book read more like a history book then a novel but it it a beautiful tale.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Loved it!  Thought it was a compelling story that makes you think about your belief system where fate is concerned.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie is amazing! I so wish they would make more movies like this.  It is amazing to watch and experience.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Really liked this game a lot. The entire game not just a few levels for free...wonderful! !! That doesn't happen much. My only complaint was when the developers used images in silhouette as the list of hidden items to be found. They were, at times quite difficult to figure out. Interesting story line.
B004UPALT6|4.0|It's a classic that should be watched by many. This movie brought so many ideas to table and made the horror/action genre a little bit more awesome.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I love her books. This one had me drawn in from Start to finish. Kept me wanting to know more. And those are the kind of books I love.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Daniel Craig is a great Bond.  In Skyfall he looks worn out and tired.  He is wounded, out of shape, and living in a lush paradise somewhere, drunk and pretending to be dead.  He looks used up and he is.  But one morning, while at the bar, he sees something on the news that catches his attention.  He gets up and goes home.  Because he was \\"dead\\" he is forced to go through a series of physical and mental tests, to prove his readiness to take on the bad guys.  And the movie takes off from there.  He failed all of the tests, of course, but he doesn't know that until much later.  There are some great action scenes and the relationship between 007 and M has never been better.  There are a couple of slow parts, now and then, but the villain is wonderful and Bond's sidekick, in the opening scenes, turns out to be someone we know and love. The new Q looks like a 12 year-old geek and is very likable.  There is a surprise ending, which means there will be some changes in the next film.  Craig brings a complex heart and soul to the Bond character.  He is interesting to watch.  He's tough, guarded, does what has to be done, regardless of the cost, and yet he seems lost and conflicted.  M tells him that \\"orphans\\" make the best agents...and maybe she's right.  Craig is far less superficial than the other Bonds (although I love Sean). The villain garners our sympathy on some level.  He has been severely damaged and abused by the Agency.  The torture and abuse made him what he is.  All in all it's a great film and Daniel Craig is an exceptional Bond.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Even though the characters in these books are fictional, I have learned an enormous amount about modern world history from them.
1439153663|4.0|Very well written historical fiction.  A very large number of characters are introduced early in the story.  I found myself needing to keep a list.  The story explores the grave injustices to slaves and woman alike during this period.
0061537969|5.0|this book is for you. I just wouldn't read it if your dog is old and nearing the end of its life, because it will break your heart.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This might have been the most interesting game I have ever played in a lifetime! Might I add that it's very old-fashioned. I love games like this.
0425263908|5.0|This book is better than 5 shades of grey. Already read the second and I am hoping for a third.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I like this game very much.  It is kinda like a fast paced mahjongg game. Nice graphics and its really cool how you can turn the cube and click on the matches from different angles and views.<br />Recommend this game!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a good app. Works well, is easy to use, and nice that it's free. Like that the numbers and big

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was an exceptionally inspiring read.  Absolutely loved it!<br />It will change the way you live your life right now.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This animated feature of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns is great and turned out better than I expected. In many scenes, in my opinion, enhances upon the original graphic novel and I would say even better than the source material. The lines and colors are much smoother and richer here, and Miller's story plays out nicely, proving the book was written with a cinematic scope in mind. Again, some scenes in this movie look better than how they were laid out in the book.<br /><br />I was routing for Bruce Wayne and Batman and reminded me much of how bada$$ Batman was in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.<br /><br />The extras include a great documentary about Batman creator Bob Kane, a featurette about girl robin Carrie Kelly, two episodes from the Batman animated series and more. Only thing I felt was missing from the extras is an interview with Frank Miller himself, but maybe he's in the extras for Part 2, I hope.<br /><br />Can't wait for Part 2!!
B00A4GXJD0|3.0|This album had me confused.  Was he going back to his roots of hard rock, sticking to his new genre or just a little of everything?  Some songs are good, classic Kid Rock.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is so enjoyable to watch and I always look forward to the next episode--It's like an excellent novel that you don't want to put down!  The characters are well developed and really make you love (or hate!) them!  For some reason, the first time I watched the pilot, I quickly lost interest and dismissed the series--I'm so glad I watched it again because this is a rich series with many plot lines that are interesting and entertaining!<br /><br />I'm just sorry it took me so long to listen to all the hype and finally join the Downton Fan Club!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|My 10 year old daughter and I love these little dragons. She plays on her iTouch and I play on my iPhone. cute.
B0089XH38M|4.0|At least I think it works.  I have not had any problems with it, and it is in the background not interfering with any of the aps I am running.  So I like it.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|We Love this movie!  Saw it 3 times in the theater and have already watched it 10 times at home!
B0089AF2DS|4.0|Picked this up on a recommendation from a friend.  Excellent if a little repetitve.  Definitely prefer the faster tracks to the slow groovy stuff but overall I dig it.  Good stoner rock vibe.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I was surprised by this book as I was expecting light read but I was engaged right away and was rooting for the two characters from the start. The progression and ending was not cheesy or shortcut formulaic. A good read overall.
B005GYY0GA|5.0|Great song compilation along with great guests.<br />His guitar and voice are as good as ever. One of his best cd's to date.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Outstanding!  Couldn't get enough of Downton Abbey and the fascinating story lines.  My husband and I both couldn't wait to get home every night and lock the door, turn off the phone, and watch the fascinating saga of Downton Abbey!  We actually enjoy the DVDs more than watching the episodes live on PBS.  10 stars if I could rate it that high!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I ordered this as a last minute pick and U am so glad I did.  It is a great CD and it came in just 2 days with another order I had made earlier.
0307352153|5.0|Susan Cain wrote Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking. Being an introvert, naturally I loved it. I could not put it down. I felt like I was reading something the perfectly explain my strengths, weaknesses, frustrations, and left me with a feeling of understanding. It also challenged me to work out some issues that I've allowed myself to neglect, because I've bought into the lie that people should just take me as I am.<br /><br />There were 3 points that were especially helpful to me in reading Susan's book.<br /><br />1. Open office plans vs. Independent work spaces. How is your office set up? Does everyone work in the same space, share ideas, collaborate in the process or are you secluded in an office to work on your own? How do you work best? Susan says that performance gets worse as group size increases and that at times, open offices have shown to reduce productivity and impair memory.<br /><br />2. Being shy is not equal to introversion. Introverts may actually not be shy, they might just be observing. In childhood, an introvert may have been challenged to invert themselves into scenarios where they would have rather hung back and watched. There may be in increased sensitivity to stimulation for a child where an introvert is taking in more than can be sustained over long periods of time. Withdrawal is necessary at those times. It's not shyness, it's just a need to hang back from over-stimulation for a bit.<br /><br />3. Just because I'm an introvert doesn't mean I get to function in my introverted ideals all the time. I don't have to become an extravert to be \\"important\\" in society, but I also have to act outside of my introverted self at times to be heard. My responsibility is to listen well to others, and respond accordingly. I don't have to be gregarious to have something to contribute, but I do have to sometimes stretch myself beyond what's comfortable to be able to be the best I can possibly be at my job and in relationships.<br /><br />I would recommend Quiet to anyone who is an introvert looking to understand themselves better, and to grow. I would recommend it to parents of introverts so you can help your children function to the highest ability of themselves. And to those of you who work closely with introverts, as it will help you to understand why they may respond how they do and give you tools in your communication.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so easy to play will keep you entertained for hours. good graphics and very realistic. love the new features. all the mini games are wonderful
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I decided to view this movie because it had two things I like action and Denzel.  This man has this cheezy smile that just catches my mind and I just stop in my tracks. Then it had about 14 minutes of pure hand wringing action with the plane scene.<br />Then we get to the real meat of the movie the backstory.  Whip is floating thru life on a cloud of self deception.  His friends and co-workers allow it and don't challenge at all. This is worth every minute of the dialog and if you don't finish this movie with real questions about every charactors reponsibilities in this whole wretched business then you are not thinking straight. John Goodman is so sleezy good!<br />Just think if he controlled that plane in his depressed state so well, what could he have done in top notch condition.  I don't like to review and give away the plot so just watch and THINK!  Denzel should get a Oscar but since he didn't have fake a accent I guess he out of luck.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|THIS BOOK IS ADDICTIVE, I'VE READ IT IN 2 DAYS! I AM GRATEFUL TO HAVE THIS BOOK I WILL READ IT AGAIN
B008Y6WPXC|3.0|The Expendables is for action freaks for sure.  This movie is well titled though, it is expendable.  etc., etc., etc.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|Works as it should. Has a bit of heat to it as one might expect from TB gear. The thunderbolt connection is sort of loose, but haven't had an issue with connection dropping. Serves it's purpose.
B007SGM084|5.0|OMG! I borrowed the 1st book from the library. Halfway through, I decided to buy the trilogy because I just can't put it down & couldn't wait to read the 2nd & the 3rd book.<br />First book: Intense! You don't know what happens next.<br />Second book: Caters to the hopeless romantic in me.<br />Third book: Didn't expect the ending but love it!<br />Love it....love it...love it!!!<br />Can't wait to watch the movie!
0545403359|5.0|My 8 year old granddaughter begged for this book, even though she was told it was sad and she would cry. She couldn't put the book down, and she did cry, but she loved it anyway. Although she is 8 years old, she is reading at level 4.7.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV.  My widfe and I jumped on the bandwago late - just started season one in late december.  For US, parents of two young kids with very little TV time, we have been ripping through these - sometimes 2 episodes per night, and obviously late night, past kids' bed times.  I feel I am turning into a zombie sometimes.  But I have to say, this is a quality show, where Drama and human relations are front and center.  Zombie stuff is obviously there but a clear second priority.
B008B92U32|1.0|Even as a free app at the time it was not worth the time to download. Useless. Cheesy. No formatting capabilities. Avoid.Avoid.Avoid.

B00007EDY5|2.0|Did not work with the two cameras I have, I did not know hotshoes were different.  Probably works fine with Nikons
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Excellent quality and very realistic. It is the same used in the Star Trek 2009 movie. It has two pins and you can use it for real.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Joe is a fabulous guitar player, very soulful Blues and full-on Rock together.  Fast like Al Di Meola, not Flamingo style, and more Blues / Rock.  I hope he continues to improve his talent, this is a great live CD set.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Wow, where do I begin with this god awful series? I read these books because of the hype, my mom's recommendation, and the fact that I wanted to read a book to spice things up in the bedroom with my boyfriend. After finishing the first book, I asked my mom how she put up with this crap. She kept saying, \\"it get better, I promise\\". So, I trudged along. I found myself staying up late into the evening, not because the book was so good that I couldn't put it down, but because I just wanted to get this series over with and find better books to occupy my time. It baffles me how many people enjoy this series.<br /><br />I'll start out with the terrible writing. Seriously? It reads as if a middle-schooler wrote it. This series makes Twilight seem like a prolific author such as Anne Rice or (as another reviewer said) like Shakespeare wrote it. The repetitive phrases were annoying, yet tolerable, at first but then it just got downright infuriating. How many times does Ana need to say \\"oh my\\" or \\"holy cow\\" or any derivative of \\"holy [insert curse word here]. Also, WE GET IT! Christian's hot! You don't need to remind me after every page! Which leads me into these pathetic characters. We'll start with \\"Ms. Steele/Grey\\". I didn't think I could dislike a character more than I disliked Bella in Twilight. Thank you Ms. James for showing me that Bella ISN'T the most pathetic character ever written. This 22 year old child needs to stop being so f****** delusional. She's so mesmerized by Christian's wealth and good looks that she fails to see what an overly jealous, stalker sadist who gets angry at the slightest thing. Oh wait, I forgot! She does see how jealous and overbearing he is, but its okay because he's hot, rich, and good in bed.<br /><br />They got married after only knowing each other 5 months and it shows. They are ALWAYS arguing about one thing or another and then have sex. That's all this book is. It's sex, sex, sex. I understand that it's supposed to be an erotic novel, but at least make each sex scene interesting and different! All the sex scenes are just in different places and different positions, but other than that, it's all the same. And I just wanted to punch Ana's inner goddess and subconscious in the face. Actually, I take that back, her subconscious was the only rational thoughts she had, but she ignored him.<br /><br />I loved how Christian wanted to be her \\"Dom\\" and inflict pain on her like in any bdsm relationship, so why does he get so turned on when he handcuffs her, then gets upset and the red marks it left on her wrists and ankles? I thought that was the point? His mood swings are downright ridiculous. I have bipolar disorder and even I don't act like that. And then there's the ever-present Mrs. Robinson. What the hell kind of person has a bdsm relationship at 15 years old with a 30 year old and then has a long standing friendship with her after the relationship ends? Also, what 15 year old would WANT a bdsm relationship having had child abuse issues. Wouldn't that make a sane person loathe that type of thing rather than like it? I'm no expert as I was never abused as a child nor have I ever been in a bdsm relationship, but the psychology major in me says that doesn't exactly mesh well.<br /><br />Then there's Ana's orgasms. She has multiple orgasms every time they have sex and practically orgasms with just the slightest touch. I'm sorry, but that just doesn't happen. I could continue on with my loathing of this series, but I think I've made my point. Don't waste your money on this nonsense. If you want to read something more stimulating (no pun intended), read a 6th grader's essay because that would be more enjoyable than this drivel.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Easy reading for the most part. However, there are some sections that get too technical for the general public.  He was truly blessed to live to tell his story.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I was very impressed with quality of this bag.  This bag was a lot bigger and roomier than a previous bag I purchased for double the price.
B006S08RLU|5.0|The availability and efficiency of renting movies on Amazon is a life-saver at times. I needed to watch this movie a few hours before class for extra credit and Amazon made it possible.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|The first thirty or so minutes is great - and the last maybe ten is also pretty great - but the rest is just blah. Then again, I rented it thinking it was a story about a plane crashing, not about a man's journey to discover he's an alcoholic. So. There's that. Lots of talk about God and alcoholism... that's about it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|On the edge of my seat, waiting for more. This book is the best of the whole series. That's saying a lot.
B001EBULU8|4.0|I could watch this movie over and over and over.  I love any movie about Jesus and God (as long as it follows the bible).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very educational, yet entertaining.I  liked it very much and looking forward to season 4, wish i did not have to wait almost a year for it though.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Funny, charming, and an overall great movie! The subtitles aren't a distraction like some subtitled films. I highly recommend this film.
B004XANKVO|5.0|este producto me encanto, no tenia idea de que tan bueno sería. muy funcional y bastante útil para cualquier ocasión
B00A80SHFM|3.0|So, I knew this was &#34;highlights&#34; and thought that meant they would just have the main songs and leave out all of the jibber jab, which is what i wanted. But, they cut off the overture &#34;look Down&#34; and left &#34;do you hear the people sing?&#34; out  completely. That is very disappointing!I would have thought after all the money they put into this movie, they could come out with a decent soundtrack!
0920668372|5.0|everyone should have this book  no child should leave home without it. and be sure to read it again and again.
B002APU580|5.0|The American ending is just perfect!  The scene is the rain is superb!  Both lead actors really<br />&#34;become&#34; Jane Austen's characters.
141694737X|5.0|This book was one of our children's FAVORITE books when they were toddlers!  We all loved the story and the kids loved opening the flaps.  The book quality is excellent - and I continue to buy the book as gift for other parents.

B0085HWZDK|5.0|This Blu Ray was well produced and has a lot of Robert Plant's new material as well as a few Led Zeppelin songs. I wish I was there live to see it, but since I wasn't this is next best thing.
B009E3EY38|5.0|What a great performance and wonderful DVD.  I loved this.  I saw the movie originally in the theater and had to buy a copy of for myself.
B000ICZD5M|1.0|This movie leaves so many important details from the book out that it is really confusing and hard to follow. It was probably great in its time, but not a classic.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Smart lyrics which go deeper than balling outta control on dubs with the windows down.  Real emotion and thoughts.  Personal stories like Starting Over which make the whole thing that much better.  Couple it with crazy tracks like Thrift Shop and you have a spectacular first full length album.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|Gave these to my grandkids...so I heard that they liked the movie...I myself have never seen it yet....hopefully I will when I am over at their house sometime.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is a lot of fun! the puzzles have cute pictures, including Anne Geddes!  I totally recommend this game for anyone who loves puzzles
B009VB7P6G|4.0|Cute story.  Watched this with my daughter, otherwise I wouldn't have watched it.  I was pleasantly surprised with how it turned out.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I'm not a regular reader - This autobiography I could not put down. There are few people that made such an impact on the world.
B005VMSATA|5.0|I read Green Lantern comics since I was a kid.  He was my second favorite superhero after Superman, a higher slot than Batman, Flash, or the Green Arrow.  I haven't followed the stories in quite a few years, but I was interested in seeing how they pulled off the movie. Ryan Reynolds was okay+ at GL, there could have been a better choice, but he wasn't bad at all.  If they would make a sequel with him as GL, I would definitely watch it.
1400067820|5.0|This is a powerful read. Taleb is brilliant, slightly and deservedly arrogant, and a great thinker. He understands the math, the relationships, and he makes the difficult diagnoses.<br /><br />He is always many steps ahead, and I appreciate him for this.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Saw this movie long ago and had to watch it again. Loved it just as much! The story the drama, the acting all superb.
B007SGM084|5.0|Best purchase I've made in a while...Great book too...well worth rereading over and over...Can't wait for her next series hopefully soon...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just when everything right everything goes wrong classic downtown abbey plot progression. But it works. It's actually heart breaking. Have to love the relationship between Branson and Matthew.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to learn how to play and super fun way to pass the time on my commute. Definitely will recommend this to my friends.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a great story and it explains how we are can get involved in something and have a<br />hard time getting out of it and getting on with a life.
0743277708|5.0|This is one of those books that slipped through the cracks of school and I never read until adulthood.  It is impossible not to relate to the rabbits' struggles and feel happiness in their success.
B000171RZE|1.0|Dvd had odd subtance on it upon arrival. It also would not play in the multiple players that I tried
B000JQUKKU|5.0|This is a book everyone should read around the Christmas holiday. It gives the reader a chance to remember the true meanings of Christmas
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Runs relatively cool and the HD 4000 graphics makes a difference. It handles 1080p without any hiccups. Working great on my XBMC HTPC.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound of Music is a must see for anyone. One never gets tired watching this. Great to see on dvd.
B008CO1DPM|5.0|It's not as small as you'd think (check the measurements), but it is extremely well designed and built. I'm using it to run an XBMC HTPC, with an Intel Core i3-3225, and it is perfect for it. It includes removable trays for the optical disc drive and HDD, both of which I am not using (I went with a Crucial m4 32GB mSATA Internal Solid State Drive CT032M4SSD3 instead, plenty for my box). Case has great ventilation from side to side. Get it.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|TALKING TOM WILL NOT DOWNLOAD ON MY KINDLE FIRE DEVICE. MY DAUGHTER HAS IT ON HER I PHONE AND I THOUGHT IT TO BE VERY FUNNY.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I have to admit that I'm a die-hard for most dance related movies, I say that this falls under the same general category, except it really over-delivered in terms of what I was expecting.  Although I've never seen &#34;Glee&#34; I'm told this is close... I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B00A757EFW|2.0|Seems to be a very small screen and hard to get pac man to go up and down. I have loved this game every since it came out but the screen is just to small .
0810989956|5.0|This book is full of comedy (as well as some crazy fiction) and real life situations that I believe kids go through today. My nine year old loves this as well as his 13 year old sister! This book is good for any age child!
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|My girls can't get enough of this movie.  I wish they would have left out some of the \\"boy\\" humor...But, overall, I too, enjoyed the fun times and music-mixes.
B000000XBC|1.0|I love CCR and have for decades but cd's from this company are somehow damaged.  Every time I buy one it skips and I have to send it back.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game a lot because I love the movies. And I can build all kinds of homes for the ice age animals.
B000000XB9|5.0|CCR is one of my favorite groups.  This is a great album.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|new as soon as i heard the samples i had to have this cd.. definately a recording artist you can shirley groove to!
B00811U0FK|5.0|This is a very well sculpted figure of Nami showcasing her appearance from the later half of the Water Seven/ Enies Lobby story arc. It comes with an alternate clima-tact without the lightning effect and an alternate face. As stated from the Figuarts Zero title, there is no (zero) articulation but the pose is magnificent. The paint job is well done and the base features her Jolly Roger. The price was very reasonable and it is an authentic figure from Toei for North America. Battle version Nami will make a great addition to any One Piece fan or any figure collector.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Nothing fancy and works great. Nice slider to hold the trigger button down for extended shots. Obviously much more reliable than Nikon's IR trigger.
B001NLKT60|2.0|The author is a little too enamoured of his own character.  The book is needlessly repetitive and slow moving.  I don't recommend it.
0062024329|5.0|Just like it was described. No complaints from me. I will be back again as a repeat customer. super-duper-mega-great-ultra-fantastic. Thanks.
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|This movie is great. There are moments of laughter and of tears. There was a time during the movie, in which I found it a bit hard to stomach. I do think that the movie does show what happens overseas and afterward rather accurately. To me, this is a must watch.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|We received it as scheduled and in good condition. I live the two disc because in our Van it will only play DVD and in the house we can play the Blue Ray. Fun movie.
B001O54NKS|5.0|I'm a child of the 80's, and Dokken, along with Van Halen were my two favorite bands.  Shredding guitar, soaring vocals and memorable riffs and beats are king in this album.  The songs are now on my I-Pod!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Have read all the Connelly books and this nears the top of the best list! Looking forward to more of his Bosch books.
B0042L78MG|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have heard in a long time.  She is really talented and has an upbeat style.  Lots of fun.
B00915G6R6|5.0|I like everyhting about this show, I buy all the releases and will continue to buy until the season is complete
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love having a kindle on my android phone I can read on the go, and i love the low price of my kindle books.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My family loves these mazes. This is the hardest of the three and it gave them all a run for the money. The first one I purchased was the second hardest and each one of them finished it within a week. So I had to get this one for a real challenge for them, still hasn't been completed yet and I expect it to be awhile before they do. Definately would recommend this as a brain / dexterity toy and much better for everyone than sitting in front of a computer or game box for hours on end.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|great movie, as usual great performance by Denzel . I don't remember any a OK movies with Denzel they all 5star in my opinion. he is just a terrific actor! gotta love Denzel.
B009DTI0IS|5.0|The Movie and in particular the extras are a must for any PJ fan. I would imagine that it would be of great interest to the passive fan as well since it tells a great story of a band from this era (yes, already in the past), and how they reached stardom but yet tried in vain to keep it real. Great inputs from members of other bands of the time.
4805311193|5.0|If you are interested in Japanese history regarding: the Edo Period, the fall of it, and/or samurai in general, then this book is definitely for you. There are only about a dozen characters in the book, but to comprehend the story you need to remember their names and roles (an easy thing to do, actually). Just remember this from page one. I lived in Japan for a number of years and had a blast associating the places in the book with where I'd been. The author did a tremendous amount of research for this book and should be rewarded for it. He even found pictures of the two main characters. That is a real treat to see - putting faces on the names. So, I give him 5 stars; coming from a person interested in this type of history.
B00AZVCDRC|5.0|I'm a old fan of Holmes, the character - having seen so many shows do so many takes on him. I think this and the BBC Sherlock are my two favorite takes on him. That being said - Miller's character is outstanding. It's hard to believe that it's really him. I think that a lot of detective shows miss one thing and that's a sense of true vulnerability. And this Holmes? Has it. I think him and Lui are perfect as Holmes and Watson and I truly enjoy the fact that they made Watson a woman - and not only just *a* woman but a very strong, intelligent one. So many female roles in television now are nothing more then gross caricatures.<br /><br />I watch more then a few detective procedurals and this has to be one of my favorites. I'd recently been watching The Calling but I think I'm going to ignore and drop it in lieu of a much better written show. This one. Loads better, really. I can't believe I almost missed this one in passing due to it being Holmes and (as I had almost thought) it to be a poor show.<br /><br />It's anything *but* poor. It's amazing. Do yourself a favor. Just watch the pilot. If that doesn't hook you? Then go back to reality tv. :)
B004U8VWLE|4.0|Very well-acted, well-crafted movie - I cringed with each physical manifestation!  Ending was superb, unexpected.  A little darker than the average movie I watch, but I'm glad I saw it.
1905236042|4.0|My grandkids and I love this format.<br />We spent many hours over our last vacation doing<br />poses and practicing our breathing.<br />Have had books in the past. This was a fun<br />and new approach!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This is one of the worst movies I've paid money to see in quite some time.  I knew it was a marginal success in the US, but I then read in EW that it had grossed over $500 million world wide!  So I figured I was wrong.  NOPE!<br />Mark Wahlberg is as hot as ever, Mila is totally beautiful, and Seth McFarlane is as funny as he is on TV - - which is the problem.  He can swear in a movie, but he has put his best foot forward on TV.  His imagination and creativity is absolutely amazing - but this isn't his forum.  You can't force Peter Griffith inside a stuffed bear - well, you can, but that would be porn - So I'll just keep watching the original on TV.  This movie totally blows - and NOT in the good way!!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Great case.  Holds up well.  Nice color. Meets my needs.  Would buy another to replace it when it is needed.
0765325950|5.0|Well written and tied all the loose ends up.  (Well, mostly.)<br /><br />I wish Robert Jordan could have finished it, but since he couldn't, I'm glad Brandon Sanderson was chosen to do it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|easily the best horse game for kindle. burk would like less pop up adds and some things different in the game. but overall it is fun to play for hours
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very enjoyable, some might even say addictive. It is easy to pick up and play briefly as permitted throughout my day.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|With all wood floors in a two story three bedroom house this is the best little sweeper I've ever owned. The ease of use is what makes it so great for me with the dog hair on our stairs every day. The rechargeable battery costs as much to replace as buying a new sweeper so now I have TWO. :-)
1616550414|5.0|I'm about  halfway through and so far this book has been amazing. I do agree it has a lot of emphasis on skyward sword. I've played many Zelda games before this one and never got to it but I want to play it more than ever.  Grab this book to experience the genius behind the games!
B000KLS2LI|5.0|I have the Rydell sweater & the leather jacket T Birds, so now I have all three of the special collection from Grease!!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Really like this game......nice bright colors. You can shuffle the remaining tiles. Nice and easy no glitches can't wait to see how many games are available to play.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|BREAKING DAWN.  Great books, I wish there were more....Breaking Dawn  I hope she writes some more....More, More, More, More, More
B007B6VOG0|5.0|There are a few songs I'm not so crazy about, but most of the songs are fabulous, and such a great price!
B007THA4FI|5.0|A great story of how the way we appear to the outside world isn't always what it seems behind closed doors.  The secrets and experiences keep the reader interested all the way through this book.  It reflects the reality of the expression &#34;every front door bleeds a little&#34;.  Compelling read.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|I think this game functions great!  It puts a great twist on the game so it adds a new level of challenge!  This is a great game for any age or gender.  I would reccomend this game to anyone looking for a game to add that the whole family can enjoy!
B007704HO6|4.0|A great story of a young man struggling to find a purpose in life when a stray cat enters his world and they help each other.  A wonderful tale for anyone who has loved an animal.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|I love Christina Aguilera's Lotus cd because she has a nice voice and I always love what she sings about love and over coming the stroughles of life
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Loved it I used it when I did taxes! I recommend this product  for it easy use and quick download
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a wonderful book and i would tell everyone I know to read it I can't wait to get the second one to read Fifty Shades of Dark.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Was wonderfully written but a bit too gruesome for me.  I understand that the story was based on a real life story but I'll be reading a different kind of book next.
B00881VLCE|1.0|i downloaded this app and now i dont know how to pull up the puzzles. The puzzles never come up i press the download button still theres nothing.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've been using Accuweather  on my not so smart phone for years and have always been happy with it.  It is even better on my Kindle Fire.  Much easier to read and navigate.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the book a lot it was very violent some times but very good. If you want a melody story and a book that you will love read harry potter. It is very romantic.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is so useful and easy to use that it quickly becomes indispensable.  I've got it on all my devices and it works brilliantly on them all.  Gives a good indication when gadgets need charging rather than relying on guesswork, which I find particularly handy.  Easy to use, and works flawlessly.  Could not do without it now - highly recommended.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I chose this rating because I love these books so much they pull u in and made me read for hours on end!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to see and use. I pull this up throughout the day for calculating my mpg and checking ledger. Love it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Very very interesting book and of course, very well written.  I recommend it. It was on sale when I bought it but I would say well worth a higher price!
0446554995|4.0|I am still reading this book, to me it is a little slow reading, not the have to finished as the rest of the series but still worth the read.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|My 28 year old wears one as a novelty along with my 5 year old grandson!  I hope it is durable.
0307408833|5.0|Love all the recipes. Can't wait to try some of them.  Very creative ideas.  I can't wait to start baking.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Game is wonderful till level 11. I can't seem to put the stain glass picture together. Although all the square look fine. Graphics are nice.<br />Game is fun and addictive. Love the mystery find games.
B005HSL626|5.0|It is a smaller version of the game at Dave & Busters! My daughter was very entertained.  Easy to grasp, too!
B004BLDD9Y|1.0|Lighting Ever company .... you have a problem.<br /><br />I loved this bulb when I purchased it.  I put it in a very inaccessible open fixture at the top of a stairwell.  I purchased three bulbs in July 2011 and installed the fixture with bulbs around August of that year.  The fixture is open, so heat was not a problem.  These lights are used maybe 1 or 2 times a week while I am working on my basement remodel.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when about 1 month ago I noticed that one of the bulbs was extremely dim.  The only thing comparable would be a night-light bulb.  I was upset, but since I had two other bulbs in the fixture, I could live with it for the time being.  Fast forward to last night (2/12/13) when one of the bulbs stopped working completely.  I am so mad, because not only did I apparently waste my money on a bulb that had no longer lifespan than an incandescent, but I also must now use a ladder and 2x12 scaffolding arrangement to replace them.<br /><br />I hope Lighting Ever company will see this review and fix their problems, because I cannot even send them back to Amazon for replacement/refund without incurring shipping charges.  Hardly worth it.<br /><br />T Servies
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This subway surfers game is addicting and cool. Because wen you r playing you just want to keep playing and keep trying to collect more and more coins. Also it it trys to surprise you wen you get the mystery box. All you guys reading this and other ratings should really download this game.<br /><br />  Love;<br /><br />  Arielle
B007FRHZ4A|3.0|I'll start with a word on the \\"game play\\" of this game.  It stinks.  In fact, \\"game play\\" is in quotes because it's really not even a game.  At least not for my family.  We've had every set of these and this is the most difficult to actually build with because of the shape and unevenness of the blocks.  And the catapult has not been improved in any version, so it remains incapable of accurately launching anything.  But, to be honest, we don't have all the sets to play them as a game.  My son just loves to build random structures with these blocks, legos, pillows, plush toys - you name it really.  The little figures are great and they are the draw for my son.  This is more like an \\"add-on\\" set to build more structures with.  As I mentioned, this set is not the easiest to build with, but in combination with other, FLATTER, blocks, he can create elaborate \\"levels\\" to knock down.  Overall, I'd say, if your kid is an Angry Bird nut they will enjoy this and get use out of it.  If you are looking for a fun family game, this probably doesn't meet that need.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Lots of fun and it scared me a few times. I  enjoyed searching for the items and also figuring out how to combine items to be able to use them. I did cheat and used the easy mode.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I was addicted to the Hunger Games from beginning of first book, But this one made that addiction worse. Couldnt put it down.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|This CD is different than what I expected, but very good nonetheless. It is very heavy in the folk genre with country roots, but with cooler alternative elements as well.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|Although this movie does not follow the book exactly, it is well worth seeing.  My daughter and I both really liked it.  The acting is very good, and there are good values upheld in the movie.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|Gotye is super-hot right now and rightfully so.  Their CD is great, and most of their songs are just as good as their hit, &#34;Somebody That I Used to Know.&#34;
1609611543|5.0|This is an excellent book. Full of information that I wish everyone knew and understood. I have recommended it to everyone I know who is interested in trying to stay healthy through diet.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed the twists that this novel provided.  It is equal to many of Grisham's earlier works, that I enjoyed.
B0052TDGQO|4.0|This was a gift, and I almost wish I had not gotten it. Every time I get into that friend's vehicle, she plays this cd. And ONLY this cd, lol.
B0086700CM|4.0|I downloaded this app solely to amuse myself in waiting rooms, husband watching sports, ( you know, during the boring stuff).  However, I found myself playing this every chance I get.  I even have my husband taking my kindle from me to play.  It's a great game.
B000P0J0D8|4.0|Usually he either leavens the darkness withdr humor or it's just so jaw dropping you're entranced. This one didn't quite work. Great performances, though.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I cannot wait till Amazon comes out with Season 5 for Prime customers to stream for free. I think this is a great show!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 5 year old loves this game and so does my husband! They love to sit on the couch and compete against each other to see who can get the farthest! My 5 year old loves to give his dada a run for his money!!!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Great cd I love every song. Lumineers are the BEST !!! If you like avett brothers and mumford and sons you are sure to like the lumineers.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|A few laughs but not worth your time. I love juvenile humor, but this even lacked for that , just ridiculous.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|AMAZING<br />AWESOME<br />UNBELIEVABLE<br />LOVE IT!!!!!!!<br />REALLY FUN TO PLAY!!!!!!<br />REALLY FUN TO PLAY<br />REALLY FUN TO PLAY<br />REALLY FUN TO PLAY
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy this one on my Kindle Fire<br />, just one issue for me is you can not turn off the annoying music loop without turning off all the sound.
B00004WQ3A|5.0|If you haven't heard this, I can't do anything for you.. Its really good! Crawl out from your rock and get this.. Its a good 'un!
B0002HYFEI|5.0|My 4 year old plays with this almost every day. Would have liked to see booklet with more ideas, but this is also a great toythat can be used many ways...and we do! We use other HABA blocks and also other toys (and set on books) to integrate with the ball track.  Recommend.
B0016SEW9K|5.0|Great album! If you are new to Frank Zappa, a good place to start is &#34;Apostrophe&#34; and &#34;Over-nite Sensation&#34;.. Fantastic albums!
B007SGM084|5.0|THESE HAVE TO BE MY FAVORITE BOOKS EVER!!! I ONLY WISH THE SERIES WOULD KEEP GOING (I COULD PROBABLY READ FIFTY MORE OF THESE!!)
B007IXWL2C|2.0|dressed up as a very readable and gripping story. If you like that sort of thing, its  quite OK, I dont.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app because the games within differ in difficulty.  I only wish the bonus points for beating the games would get passed along again when you get a higher score.
1932100660|5.0|For those of you who take food seriously, this a must read.  Very thorough & informative.  I can say enough good about this book!
B009G78EE2|5.0|I'll admit, the first song that interested me in this album was Thrift Shop, with it's catchy chorus and cleverness. The second one, Otherside, convinced me that it wasn't a joke album or petty boasting. It feels like an album that perfectly conveyed what these guys are about. Really an outstanding album.
0142501123|4.0|Room on the Broom by Julia Donaldson. Lovely story, lovely pictures. Great for any age child. Good for &#34;grown ups&#34; too!
034580404X|5.0|I love all the books and the books came on time just like you guys said.  So I would order again.<br /><br />Thanks
1451695195|4.0|I felt like Dr. Alexander was trying too hard to convince the 'medical/scientific' world about his near death experience (NDE). There were several words I didn't understand and had to stop out from my reading to look them up in a dictionary or online, so it was a bit of a stretch to complete the book. I did read it from beginning to end, and I feel certain that Dr. Alexander's experience was real. He is highly intellegent, very knowledgeable and experienced in his field of expertise. He certainly knows how to explain things in 'detail.'  I especially liked how he kept bringing in his family and the role each one played while he was in coma, especially the youngest son (very emotional). The part about his family: the support and love they gave him, being adopted, then finally being able to find his biological parents intrigued me the most. He is a living miracle - that is for sure!!!
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Then you cannot call yourself a film buff.<br />In fact, call out of work, go rent this and watch it.<br />Don't pull a Portlandia and lose your job or any of that,<br />but WATCH IT.<br />NOW.<br />It's FREAKING HARRISON FORD BRO.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle is my favorite singer. I will always buy every CD she makes. I wish her the very best of success in everything she does. She is &#34;real&#34;, humble, sweet, and a true leader in her field. I can't say enough good things about Susan and her wonderful God-given talent of singing. She is the best!!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I have played this game for over 6 months. enjoyed the game when it worked. but often had update issues and problems. recently the game completely reset itself and I lost countless time and money that I invested in this game. don't waste your time and money on this game. it will only reset itself to put you right back to the beginning.  I have read numerous other reviews stating this has happened. never again will I use a gameloft app.
160774273X|5.0|This is my new favorite bread baking book.  Ken provides great detailed instructions and all the bread I've made from the recipes in the book have been a success. If you are looking to start making artisan quality bread, this is the book for you.
B004HMNQQM|5.0|great movie. the characters were so believable! great performances!! wish there was a part two where he lived!! that would be cool!!
B005DOL0R0|3.0|If I would have known it was just a carrier, I wouldn't have got it. But it works for what it's designed to do (protect it). I didn't read in to it well enough, I was just thinking it was the one with the flip open part and you could use it with the kindle in it. Completely my fault.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It reads very quickly. It is great when traveling as it is easy to pick up. You dive in directly in an interesting story. The post-apocalyptic work described has some charm, but It was not as great as I thought it would be. I am currently reading the next book and maybe I will edit my review when I finished the trilogy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I got hooked on this show a few months ago.  The Amazon instant video provides the first two seasons for free to Prime users so I got caught quickly on the show.  It was worth every penny to get the season pass for season three!  The last 4 or 5 episodes were even available on Amazon before they were even shown on television which was a nice bonus!<br /><br />Can't wait for season 4...

B006FS22Y8|5.0|I love this recording - it's such a fun change from Amy's previous &#34;darker&#34; recordings (which I love).  This is fun and shows the true genius behind the artist.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|What else is there to say. Its a new Temple Run. I enjoy Temple Run 1, and I really enjoy Temple Run 2. My 5 year old loves this app too. Hes the reason I got it to be honest with you. How does a 5 year old come home from day care and know there's a new Temple Run out? I don't know, but I'm glad he did. I enjoy this app, and I enjoy him enjoying this app.

B007SGM084|5.0|We've all heard the hype and seen the women all worked up about this.  I had to read it to see if it lived up to the hype.  It did.  It has some soft BDSM stuff - nothing the magnitude of Anne Rice's Beauty series - but it's fun and fast to read.  It is steamy and will get you in the mood.
B005ETANC2|5.0|One of the first monster movies I saw as a child, (if you can cal a 100 ft spider a monster) and it even has Clint Eastwood in a cameo at the end. I didn't know that until I was older.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless leaves you    Breathless    Speechless    Wordless    Brainless    Leaving only    Two words    With you    Sky and Holder    ******    Colleen Hoover has her way around words, as I was reading Hopeless I can literally hear her voice throughout it. I was left senseless and useless. The world around me cease to exist besides the words in front of me. With life breathing down my face.    Before I go more into it my thoughts on Hopeless, I just have to say drop whatever you are going and READ HOPELESS!    Lately I have been re-reading a lot of my favourite books because I can hardly find one that satisfies my soul. I kept waiting impatiently (mind you) for Hopeless when Colleen Hoover had generously given me an advanced copy of Hopeless so I got to read it early. (Lucky you! Hey I heard that and yes lucky me) ;) So I obviously jumped right into it.  Right from the beginning Colleen had grabbed my attention she had me hanging on each word on my screen. Than half-way through I wanted to savour it a little longer, so to torture myself I waited for an hour (in that I cleaned, did a couple of things my mom asked me, boring mundane things) than I jumped right back to it saying even if the world was ending no one would stop me from devouring HOPELESS. My heart probably stopped a few times.  My soul was crying, (Colleen did it AGAIN) I cried (few ugly tears came pouring out) near the end.    It's such a beautiful, soulful, moving story. It has a dark side. A scary one. Realistically things like this happen BUT, I wish they never did.    Sky is a passionate young girl but, when life happens, it changes you, you either fight or flight.  She choose the latter. Something happened in her past which she mentally shielded herself from darkest parts of her life. Her life started unraveling when Holder comes into her life.    Dean Holder... what do I say about him that everyone else hasn't already said. He is A-M-A-Z-I-NG, I seriously need to look into the thesaurus and find anew word besides: amazing, awesome, fabulous, wonderful.  Maybe I should come up with my own word, something that just fits where I can always use and its just ONE WORD but it explains everything.    I don't know if its only me but I feel like I always learn a thing or two from reading Colleen Hoover's books. She always gives small partings of her wisdom through her books. I love that I can grab them tightly in my fists and never let go.    A poem I wrote that was inspired by Hopeless. I wrote it a few days after because I just couldn't get Hopeless out of my mind.    So here it is!    The feeling of emptiness  Hollow feeling deep within inside  Emotions wiped out  Not a spark  Nothing ignites within me  Cold Ice within my veins    Than a storm comes  Fast, quick and powerful  Starts with butterflies at the bottom  Of my stomach  Slowly evolves  Changes my life from top  To bottom    Giving me answers to questions  I didn't know I wanted answers to  Destroys my life COMPLETELY  I want to SCREAM  Smash things apart  Throw the mirror across the room  That reflects the girl  I TRIED SO HARD NOT TO BECOME  That is sobbing hysterically  I HATE HER  I HATE HER  I HATE HER  I HATE ME    I BREAK APART  What my life becomes within  SECONDS  Of realization    The sky is only my sanctuary  From the horrors of my childhood  I walk pinky in pinky  With my hopeless boy  Looking at the bright stars  They saw everything  They held me together  They kept me going    The star gazing calms the storms  Within me    The boy who holds  All the pieces of my heart  Lights up my life like the stars  In the darkness of the night.    I think this poem basically explains why this story is that AMAZING. It also the #1 New York Times Best Selling book. (Sold you out yet??!!)    My Verdict?  5+++++++++ INTENSE, HEARTBREAKING AND SOUFUL STARS!!!    (I feel so bad, I read this book earlier than I bought a kindle copy for myself when it released but I didn't post my review here earlier!)    Read myreview on Devoured Words which is the same here but formatted differently!  [...]  Read on!

B005I4JG80|5.0|I have lived in France myself, and admire their approach to raising children. As my french collegue says; you norwegians are slaves for your kids. I don't think that's healthy for either parents or children. In this book, I recognize so many factors that I have observed and heard of myself, and I intend to use a lot of the good advice found here. The book gives insights and advice on many parts of parenting, from eating to sleeping and politeness.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book is in category of its own. The use of the Victorian inspired language of what flowers and plants meanings are intertwined with a main character who finds her voice and solace in the expression of flowers and plants.  A well told story of the alienation of a child's emotional attachments through years of life in foster care.  The topic is not new but the way this story is told is so original and revealing as the main character, Victoria, comes into adulthood and is forced to interact with the world and confront a haunting past that introduced her to love and her self inflicted exile into a singular existence.

B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|\\"Everville: The First Pillar' is a fantasy adventure by author Roy Huff and edited by Telemachus Press. This Kindle e-book was a 899 Kb download (approx. 161 printed pages) and was free on sale (normally $2.99) at the time of writing this review.<br /><br />Please Note: the author contacted me regarding posting an honest review and informed me of the introductory sale price of this book.<br /><br />Spoilers (general theme)<br /><br />Owen Sage is a freshmen at Eastern Falls Univ. in New England. He's not there long before he's mysteriously transported to the beautiful land of Everville. However he quickly learns that all in not well there... that a evil nemesis threatens this peaceful land. And if this were not bad enough, his own world is in jeopardy if something is not done to save this magical realm.<br /><br />End Spoilers<br /><br />Some thought on \\"Everville...\\"<br /><br />The Pros:<br />1.) although saving the 'realm' is not exactly a new idea, this story did have an interesting twist to an old theme. The plot did have promise.<br /><br />2.) cover art... well done and eye catching.<br /><br />3.) some well done descriptions through some wilds and caves that were tense and exciting.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />1.) Owen's two teenage sidekicks (Anika and Dante) are very one dimensional. Most of their conversations felt contrived and I didn't feel attached to their characters in any way.<br /><br />2.a) the writing... lacks that great sense of tension and urgency that you often get with a well told narration. It just seemed to have a benign, sterile quality to it.<br />2.b) early on, when someone fell down a hole they go... \\"Bump! Clank! Whoosh!\\"<br />I've alway felt uncomfortable with story telling where noises are spelled out on the written page.<br /><br />3.a) bad guys... with names like 'Them' and 'The Other in Between' it was hard to feel that our heroes were up against a truly evil and sinister force.<br />3.b) bad guys... I was taken aback as to how the readers learned of one of the main people caught up on the side of evil... it was simply announced in one of the later chapters. He wasn't discovered by some intricate detective work or villain blunder... it was simply announced, out of the blue, that he was the inside source. Talk about anticlimactic!<br /><br />4.) I never got the sense of why the 'Them' was determined to conquer Everville and the surrounding territory. The reader was never 'introduced' to any of the 'Them' so it was hard to discern their motives... maybe a topic for another book at a later date.<br /><br />5.) several spelling, grammar and repetition errors scattered throughout. Not a huge number but enough to be noticeable.<br /><br />Impressions:<br />To me, this was Young Adult (YA) reading material... not that there's anything wrong with YA writing, it's just that this is the type of important  information that readers need to know before they purchase a book. Some might say that the description on this particular Amazon.com product page should make it obvious... to me that's not adequate nor is it the point. There needs to be a specific intended age group indicator on the Amazon.com product page. And probably the responsibility of the author... I mean, how is Amazon.com suppose to know.<br /><br />Once I became familiar with the type of story and the nature of the writing I started to skim some of the latter sections. I'm not a great lover of the YA genre and have indicated the same in my Amazon.com profile.<br /><br />As a YA book (mid-late teens) I'd rate this a 4 1/2 to 5 Stars.<br />But as an attempt to convey an adult orientated story... 2 1/2 Stars.<br /><br />Ray Nicholson<br />raynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.comeaders learned of one of the main people caught up on the side of evil... it was simply announced in one of the later chapters.

B00992CF6W|1.0|Two of my children have Minecraft which they purchased directly from the Play store. I always purchase from Amazon, so I purchased a copy here so my third child can play with her siblings. I was shocked to find out the version here on Amazon was not compatible with the version my children had purchased on Play. The Play version was the newer version. Reading reviews here, it seems the Amazon updates come out much later than updates on other platforms.  I'm guessing if you wish to play random folks, it's fine to download here. But if you want to play your friends, then it seems making sure you all have the same versions will be helpful since you not able to return the Amazon version if there is an incompatibility. My kids love the game on their devices, this review is solely about the incompatibility for network play of this older version.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the first time I have purchased a movie to watch on my computer.  It was great!  I loved that I could stop it at any time and come back to it later, and as many times as I wanted to.  It was very easy to access.  Downton Abbey Season 3  was very good.  In fact, too good!  That is about all I got done.  I finally decided to just finish it so that I could get something done.  However, I would have to say, I was very upset about the way it ended.  But I guess that is what the want, to keep you captive until the next season comes out.  I will definitly buy the next season.

I would recommend 'Signs No More', then after listing to that one a few times, purchase this one.  They are both great and you'll enjoy all the music Mumford and Sons has to offer.

B008V1IR4Q|5.0|This may be a bit more Cortot than many might wish for, but not for me. In his early recording there are some true miracles that have never been equalled - such as the Etude in the Form of  a Waltz of Saint-Saens, or some of the Chopin Etudes. His &#34;Winter Wind&#34; Etude is almost super-human. Yes, he missed notes, but somehow, in this age of highly edited note perfect recordings, his fallibility endears him all the more to me. Even in  his old age when he didn't practice much and his playing was  less accurate than it was in his youth, there is always a great spirit there. This is a great set to own and it's a bargain!
B001CT877Q|5.0|One of the greatest action movies from Arnold is presented in a global and region free edition that includes many languages and Castilian Spanish is among them :)<br />Great price for a sadly underrated action film.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Given the press hoople surrounding the movie, I can only surmise it to be far superior to the book.  Even given the fact that football, particularly the outcome of Eagle's games, influences every aspect of this family's life, there is far too much time devoted to detailing every play of every game.  Had the author devoted more detail to the human condition, the fragile and mysterious psyche, and what contributes to mental illness, and less to touchdowns, firstdowns, and extra points, the book would be much more enjoyable and worthwhile.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Much more than a fiction story. You feel that this could happen in our lives though not in the way and not at this degree. But in this meaning.

0425263916|4.0|I love the first book in the series, Bared To You. I think I enjoyed this second book even more. It was filled with even more passion, more sofistication, and definitely more frustration. All with good reason, too. The ending did actually leave me a little perplexed to say the least. I know a lot of you feel the same as well. Well, anyway, here's what I really thought.    Gideon & Eva, ah, the quintenssential mad-love couple. They're both complicated people with their own set of seriuosly destructive baggage. So how do they resolve all this tension? Well, I'm sure you all who haven't read can only imagine... and those of you who have know that we were all in for a real ride through all their adventures, both saddnening and enlightening. Between character insecurities and emotional resolution there were plenty of exciting moments to drop your jaw and say \\"WHAT THE F....?\\"    There is definitely more of an emotional rollercoaster in this book. Both of these characters find themselves catapulting towards each other's abyss of destruction but also, actually surprisingly enough, their salvation.... ? I don't know... I'm a little confused with this book..    They're both similar individuals, standing side by side on jelousy, obsessiveness, and possessiveness. It's the very thing that drives them together - their similatude towards one another - that battles them against one another...    I'm not quite sure where to go next with what I felt through this romance novel. I felt I had just as much fun with this novel as I did with the previous one in the series, Bared To You, if not even more. There is something very magical about Sylvia Day's writing when it comes to romance. It's not that kind of romance that is RIGHT IN YOUR FACE but it's the kind of romance that takes takes you on AN ADVENTURE, even if at times it can be down-right shocking.    There's depth and meaning to this novel, just as there was in the first one, I believe. This series hold a very special place in my heart when it comes to Romance novels. It's elegantly accomplished for a romance novel.    [...]
B0079IJ0R0|5.0|The musical and visual impact of this \\"Carmen\\" brings rough emotion and poetry to the Characters often loss in other stuffy productions. Garanca is in her acting confident and sexy, but most of all her singing is magnificent.
0307352153|5.0|I just want to first mention that Susan Cain speaks from a very personal and intimate place about the topic of introverts. The whole time I felt powerfully connected to the book, as a result. The book is broken into the following sections: Part One-The Extroverted Ideal; Part Two-Your Biology, Your Self?; Part Three-Do All Cultures Have an Extrovert Ideal?; Part Four-How to Love, How to Work. As you can see, the book clearly calls into question and evaluates the intricate networks of our lives and society that are dominated and praised for extroverted individuals. So Susan Cain brings this piece of writing to open our minds to a world of individuals that are forsaken, set to the side, dumped to the fringes, but who all the while have contributed to our lives in ways we have chosen to forget.    One of the first introductions in the book is the notion of 'who is the introvert?' Is it the 'timid and shy' individual? Is it the individual who has 'radical humility' and 'quiet fortitude?' Is it the individual who can by 'her mere presence enough to galvanize the crowd,' like Rosa Parks? \\"We're told that to be great is to be bold, to be happy is to be sociable.\\" Is it possible that the society we have come to be encultured by has blinded us from our truest nature? Well, Susain Cain makes sure to make you aware of worlds you were never told could harness your greatest potential.    \\"Now that you're an adult, you might still feel the pang of guilt when you decline a dinner invitation in favor of a good book. Or maybe you like to eat alone in restaurants and could do without the pitying look from fellow diners. Or you're told that you're 'in your head too much,' a phrase that's often deployed against the quiet and cerebral.\\"    This book is a testament to a natural phenomena that I think all of us can relate to. We all teeter-totter between being an introvert and an extrovert, sometimes being more of one than the other. We do it whether it's for a job, or for our personal journey in life, or whether it's with our family members or a loved one. We may also change our mindset depending on what kind of circumstances we're going through. But, \\"there is no such thing as a pure extrovert or a pure introvert. Such a man would be in a lunatic asylum.\\" Quiet drives this point home, and you'll come to see it's a powerful frame of mind to come to accept and surrender to this universal truth.    There is no place more demanding to be an extrovert than the bussiness world, it seems. Harvard Business School is the epicenter of extroverts, as Susan Cain puts it midly. Oh boy, I'd feel mentally and spiritually exhausted in a world like she describes Harvard to be. Then again, I have nothing against extroverts. It's just the idea of one right versus the other that bothers me. Susan Cain makes sure to emphasize that both extroverts and introverts have important roles in our society - both types of individuals should be praised and welcomed, equally. Susan Cain goes even as far as to say that it's of massive and crucial importance for introverts to be more tolerated and embraced.    While Harvard has produced some of the most important individuals of our nation, I would say Susan Cain's urge to look at a more comprehensive perspective is also important. She contrasts US's environment to China's culture. \\"In China there was more emphasis on listening, on asking questions rather than holding forth, on putting other's needs first. In the United States, he feels, conversation is about how effective you are at turning your experiences into stories, whereas a Chinese person might be concerned with taking up too much of the other person's time with inconsequential information.\\" We must open our minds to consider that any extreme can be limiting to our growth as a nation, culture, and as human beings. It's important to consider introverts just as important as extroverts in our society, if not even more....    There are stories upon stories, examples upon examples about how introverts contribute to a qualitative style of living. Just as important, there are plenty of stories of how each, introverts and extroverts, carry important roles in our society - and we cannot be GREAT without one another but we must recognized the strengths each provide.    \\"Our lives are shaped as profoundly by personality as by gender or race. And the single most important aspect of personality - the 'north and south temperament,' as one scientist puts it - is where we fall on the introvert-extrovert spectrum. Our place in this continuum influences our choice of friends and mates, and how we make conversation, resolve differences, and show love. It affects the careers we choose and whether or ot we suceed at them. It governs how likely we are to exercise, comit adultery, function well without sleep, learn from our mistakes, place big bets in the stock market, delay gratification, be a good leader, and ask 'what if.'\\"    It is the above statement that you'll find in the very first few pages of the book. But it is in fact, a statement you will come back to at the end of the book because it places into perspective why this discourse of the introvert versus the extrovert in our society matters. It's a matter of our whole existences whether we place importance on one or the other rather the integration, tolerance, understanding and freedom to nurture and love both types of individuals. It is crucial to the growth of our whole lives - spiritually, intellectually, globally, and as mere humans.    [...]

If your a batman fan then this is right up your ally dark cold old man lol doesn't get any better and when him and Joker go toe to toe it's pretty darn good and shocking at the end of the fight. I never read the comic but now i want too. And then you throw Superman into the mix What?!?!?!?! every superhero fan knows Batman and Superman don't mix like how Captain America and Ironman don't mix on the Marvel side. It's one of the best Batman movies I've seen other under the Red Hood which is also very dark.
B00B0ZT9NI|1.0|Once I saw the name, Jimmy Carter in the description of this film, I should have known it would be about left wing politics. Unfortunately, after watching it I found that I was right.  Why do so many Hollywood movies have to preach the actors and producers political views?  What happened to the movies, where actors, directors and producers main object was to entertain the masses, and earn the big bucks they are paid?  Isn't this what Hitler did to Germany's movies before WW2?  Personally, most of the movies I now watch comes from Canada, Europe, South America and Asia, where they rely on better scripts and actors who know their craft, and not make a movie with someone just because they may have a pretty face, or in Hollywood's case, a bearded face. Argo did not meet the standards that they promised in the trailers.  The acting by Affleck was too amateurish and he failed to make me believe in what he was doing.
B007KFZ7RE|3.0|I suppose that if I wanted music that sounded like it came out of the 50s, I would buy albums from the 50s (and I do).  That said, I do like the energy of this album and for that I give 3 stars.  I gave it a fair listen on Spotify (I did not purchase) and feel that, while I thought it was fun to hear that retro sound, I was waiting for one really interesting song.  None were bad, but nothing hooked me in.  And his singing, captured throughout with an effect that makes it sound like it's through a megaphone or a can, seems ill-suited for lead vocals.  I couldn't help thinking that the effect was more to soften the flatness of his vocal abilities than to compliment the rest of the sound.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King's best work to date!!! The suspence the nostalgia. It was like I was there!!! Keep it up Mr. King!!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|We have 3 animals (kitty, monkey, and red puppy) and they are wonderful as pacifiers and as toys.  These pacifiers are hard to lose with a big fluffy animal attached to the end.  Our daughter loves these, and I have bought them as gifts for my new niece and other friends who are having or have had babies recently.  Totally recommend.
B004EF8AJA|3.0|Just watched our first installment, so far it seems to be a good series to watch. On to the next we go.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This is a must read if you like murder mysteries!! Time Killers is one of those captivating books that you can't put down until its finished! The book had me right from the start! There were lots of twists and turns to keep the reader thinking. Mr Theade did an awesome job with this novel! Can't wait to see what the next one holds!
B009JZTP4Y|3.0|When you grow up watching Star Trek, you just can't quit watching it. Beam me up Spock, there is no intelligent life here....
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Easily one of the best superhero movies ever made.  The movie transcends the genre.  Joss Whedon is such a gifted writer/director.  Can't wait to see what he does with the sequel.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I love the selection of new songs. You can hear Miss Streisand's voice change, ever so slightly throughout her career. I can't wait for the second album, I'd &#34;heard&#34; there was going to be another release…soon?!
B009ZUKY52|5.0|This SELLER did a Great job of packaging and was Very responsive. Special Thanks...  Love the convenience of the controls on the board. Key action is better than I expected and the velocity feel works great.  A lot quality and decent price. Beyond expectation.
B004XISI4A|5.0|This is a great read. The book is as exciting as the earlier books in the series. Once opening it, you will never be able to put it down.
B001JNND9W|3.0|Great 70's movie but very dated by today's action movie standards. For the price I'm glad to have purchased this DVD!!!!
B0000V6SOG|1.0|Some of the songs were not the ones sung in the movie.  The ones that were sung in the movie were sung on the CD by other people, not by the people from the movie nor from the artists who originally recorded them.  First CD I've ever returned for a refund.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As usual King has done it again. This book is action packed, romantic, nostalgic and a bit historical....it was hard to put down. I would love to see this one become a movie!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not that you look to books for role models on how women should be treated, but this book made me sad in that department.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I've now read all three novels by Gillian Flynn.  I do like the writing style and the characterization.  Dark Places was a good read, plot was unique.  Flynn stays true to her other works, this is another rather gloomy story.  There is also a large amount of time-jumping flashbacks but they are done well.<br /><br />I recommend this book.  If you enjoyed Flynn's other works, you will like this one.
0525953728|4.0|A good book that gives you insight into the mind set of Navy Seals! A little slow reading building up to the killing of bin Laden.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game. It is great game to play at meetings. When you should be doing something I play all day at work why do I need 20 words.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|Back in 1956, the movie studious were cranking out the sic-fi movies! No collection would be complete without this movie! Leslie Nielsen in a serious role before he went on to do mostly comedy! And of course every sci-fi fan recognizes Robby the Robot! Movies like this paved the way for more sic-fi movies and of course television shows like Lost in Space, etc.! So glad it was transferred to bluray!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I don't read a lot of fiction. I mostly enjoy reading biographies, theology, and history books. When I read fiction I look for something that is realistic. I saw the movie trailer a week ago and when I found out that it was based off a book then I HAD yo read it. I was hooked instantly! That is huge for me because I can be a bit ADD when it comes to reading. I kept praying for extra time to continue reading I even took a few hours on a Saturday to read it and after 4 days finally finishes. I can't remember the last time a book made me chmop at the bit for the time to read it. All I can say more is READ IT!!
0545265355|5.0|Actually, I'm speaking for my grand daughter - I bought this for her.  It's the THING for kids her age & she will read it over & over!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great book!  Not just the love story part is awesome, but also her childhood and how she finds out the truth about it.
1401223176|5.0|The order came through fine, and I just wanted to be assured it was paid for and finalized. Thank you very much.

AWFUL.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Really quickly, I want to say that the download codes, although state \\"Download by 12/31/12\\", are still usable. I purchased a new copy the other day and I simply wanted to see if they are still valid and they are. Just follow the instructions on the provided card and you'll be good.<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoy these movies and I would recommend this set for anyone who wants them on Blu-Ray. The specials are decent enough to justify the purchase.
B0098WVT9W|5.0|A great smorgasbord of music from the premier guitar talent of our time.  Also shows his talents as a producer and arranger.  I guess any &#34;A&#34; list musician would jump at the chance to play with Lee Ritenour, and he lets all his guests shine in their own way, while totally complementing their music with his own playing. My Fave is &#34;The Village&#34; ,with &#34;Punta del Sol&#34; a close second. &#34;Rose Pedals&#34; is also very nice.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The final book seemed to drag on.  It had a few interesting points but was ultimately a letdown compared to the first two.
B0096YBEIS|5.0|Heavy influence from Chuck Loeb - definitely taking the group in a new direction.  These guys are such pro's.  They make th hard stuff sound easy and melodic.  You can tell thy're all mellowed out, just playing what they love. My fave is Sonnymoon, with the title track coming in a close 2nd.  Also some nice vocals, which is relatively new for Fourplay.  A solid album...
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Great start as a new reader of the comic.  Was curious after keeping up with the show, glad I tried this out!
B007EECSFA|4.0|Two chapters in, I thought I wouldn't bother to finish.  Four chapters in, I thought I'd give it a few more pages.  This is a very good story and while, if you read as much as I do, it's not hard to figure out what is going to happen, it's still satisfying and fun and takes us to a place our parents remembered and we heard about.  Very romantic.  Very well written.  I was sorry it was over -- and that doesn't happen to me very often.
B00138EV8U|5.0|great movie, reccomd to everybody,love the story and the dancing.patrick swayze is perfect and will miss him greatly..great movie. watch it three times a week.
B004K58GSO|5.0|Ever since this movie was released it has been one that I watch anytime it is on television. This and Rio Bravo are among my favorite movies of John Wayne. El Dorado is on one of the cable channels often enough I have not even opened this DVD, so I cannot speak of the quality of this DVD yet. If you are a John Wayne or Robert Mitchum fan you will like it.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Probably should go get a kindle since that's.what.the apps for it.would probably be.better then. I do like that I can enlarge a picture by double tapping it that has come in handy with me.being an antique dealer and constantly looking things up.
B004LROUNG|5.0|The Litigators  I have read all of John Grisham books, and &#34;The Litigators&#34; was just as good as Grisham's very first book &#34;The Client&#34;  Once you start reading a Grisham, you can hardly put it down.  I give it a five star.<br />I do not like his non-lawyer books as well.  But I nevertheless read them all, and would rate them all pretty high.
B002RXZF6C|5.0|Thru amazon ,I can order just about any movie I want, even movies that are long forgotten and or some people don't really know about!!!!!!!
B0095P31L6|5.0|I got this for my granddaughter. She really likes it. She asks to watch it almost every day. I would recommend this movie to any one.
B00AM93X9E|5.0|This song saounds great on my sons Kindle Fire HD!  We downloaded it because we were tired of hearing the muffled version he kept playing off of youtube!!!
B008HK3XU4|3.0|Thought it was going to be a little more then what it was, but works great. After about a month, it doesn't stand up as good, the position that I keep it in has worn out I guess, otherwise it protects my kindle.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|This core i5 is one of the best i5 processor out there i upgraded from a AMD Phenom II X6 1090T so from this six core to this quad core has made a big difference in system performance the Intel performs a lot better than amd so highly recommended processor!
0312983867|2.0|Let me start by saying that I started to read all of JE books in order. The first 3 or 4 books were so entertaining that I continued to read on. Then all of a sudden her books started to really get on my nerves. The same things over and over and over. Not to mention the stupid dog and his antics. I really tried to go on but I realized that from eight to nineteen things will never change. Things happen to her and her friends and family that are just so unbelievable they make you scratch your head and wonder do people really believe this crap? Sorry Janet, but if you want to keep us readers interested you have to come up with somethings new and exciting. Just my own opinion of course.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is so fun! It's a great time passer and ages 5 and up ought to love it. I love this game and I think you'll love it too. Definitely a five star game. Get it, after all it is free.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I always liked evernote I can do my homework where ever and print it out from the website I save notes from school and able to save them I specific folders for later review and print I highly recommend this app for students especially students on the Go!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|this app in my opinion is essential to a long battery life. its easy to use, and when u take the time to calibrate your device you'll know exactly hiw much timeyou have for anything you might be doing
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A good tale, bringing in and tying up old loose ends from other tales, yet leaving the door open for more fun and frolics!
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Love the purple casing, it was worth the price.  The material is good quality and sturdy.  I'm very happy with my purchase!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I read some reviews that you could'nt charge while it was closed.  didnt have this issue at all.  They must of fixed this issue since those reviews.  i can charge while closed and the auto on/off feature when open/closed still works.  it was exactly what i needed for my kindle<br /><br />Thought people should know
B009M588K8|5.0|This book took no time at all to read.  It was well written and held my interest from front to back.  I can't recall ever having read a better military history book, especially one that tells such a great story.  I went and saw &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; today and it was great to learn about the intel side of the operation, and also to see the assault played out in the final half hour or so of the movie.  It seemed to follow closely the account as told by Mark Owen.  I only hope one of the helicopter pilots who flew the mission writes a book, too; that would also make for a great story.  If you are a fan of military operations, especially those carried out by people who undertake the most improbable challenges and succeed regularly, this book is a must.
0783235380|3.0|The best part of this movie is how much fun the two leads seem to be having together.  It's a rom-com with more on it's mind and that's always a good thing.  I hesitate to call it unpredictable, that would be too big a description but surprising and not formulaic.  So all in all entertaining.
0375869026|5.0|I read this with my 11 year old daughter.  What a beautiful book.  I highly recommend to anyone - especially middle schoolers!
B003XQM2YU|1.0|The sound would randomly come in and out throughout the whole movie. We stopped about halfway out of irritation of turning the sound up and down and having the rewind short parts because we missed a part since the sound callapsed.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I jumped on board the Taylor train recently after seeing \\"Journey to Fearless\\", which was a fabulous introduction into her massive musical talents (I had literally listened to zero songs of hers before seeing it).  This album is a great experience from beginning to end, there's not a bad song in the bunch.  Standouts are the opening \\"State of Grace\\", \\"Red\\", and \\"All Too Well\\", but really that's just scratching the surface.  Even the pop turns like \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\", \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\", and \\"22\\" work well within the context of the album, and provide a nice breather from the more heavy fare.  Her vocals are very affecting and the musicianship is first rate.<br /><br />For those not on the train yet: This young lady is on top of the pop music world.  Get on board, you'll enjoy the ride.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Although it took me awhile to figure out how the folio worked it was not because of the diagrams enclosed - it was my cyber-challenged mind!  The case is great for protecting the screen and still allows me to charge the battery without having to remove the Kindle from the case.  The same will hold true for using earphones, should I have them.
0689835604|5.0|Very cute story, the story is very charming, our one year old loves it. A good find for a reasonable price.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We have been riveted to this show and watched the entire 2nd season in about 3 nights after work.  Can't wait to watch the 3rd.
B00867GJYK|5.0|I love the colors on Blu Ray, the colors are vibrant and sharp.  The quality of the movie is excellent.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|So far I like it a lot. This app is easy to use, friendly and visually attractive. I have the free version and it works perfectly for my needs.
0671449028|5.0|This is a wonderful book, imaginatory and full of fun.  I enjoy ready it to the kids at bedtime.  They do too
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Well done! Acting is stellar! This mini-series has many twists and turns. Keeps you wanting more, can't wait for the next episode. The setting and time period grips your attention. I couldn't wait for the next episode I had to order them and have in my possession. I'm glad I did.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I love the colors on Blu Ray, the colors are vibrant and sharp.  The quality of the movie is excellent.
B007MCZQQ2|4.0|In order to work offline which is what I want the app for, I need to download. I already own the book but need the digital content for when the book is not convenient to pop out. I will give you five stars if you can help.<br /><br />addendum (3/4/13): I finally was able to make this app work. Sadly, it was on my own. There was no contact with the support staff for this app.<br />The interface is very nice and allows for zooming in on the pictures... which my paperback version does not allow. I think it would be greater if you could see the table of contents as the default starting point. So far, no problems from this app.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|This is my grandson's favorite movie! The colors are vivid, the quality of the DVD Blu Ray are excellent.  The other disc is good for our portable player.
B00735HGQ6|4.0|Book was a delight to read and couldn't put it down.  Felt I was walking with Harold on his journey.  Harold is a likeable chap and I was hoping he would accomplish what he set out to do.  Going to recommend this book  to my book club.  There is so much to discuss on all levels.  Not only was it Harold's Journey/Pilgrimage but also his wife's, those who walked with him as well as Queenie. An easy delightful read and  highly recommend this book to read.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|This WiFi adapter is the one to get. I have mine setup in a barracks room made of brick, my laptops normal WiFi adapter barely picks a bar from the WiFi there. With this I have full signal!<br /><br />The packaging is professional and it comes with a driver CD. You do need to install the drivers but it is very simple. Also included is a mini USB adapter with a second USB connection for additional power, though I didn't need to plug the second one in when running it off my USB 3.0 port on my laptop.<br /><br />Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone needing range for their WiFi (or needing to get through some brick walls).
1878424319|5.0|This book is so good we have ordered four more and plan to give many more next holiday. Great gift for young and old.
B009O2XY12|4.0|this little game is colorful, and whimsical. It is a challange to complete all 3 stars in a world. relaxing too.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Something new, great lyrics.<br />Not Mumford and sons, not civil wars, they have their own sound.<br />A great relief and break from the overload of over complicated 50+ track songs that assail your ears. A simple clear sound, and their voices are unique.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun game to play.  Just wish their were a few more rounds before it was completed however can get more by purchasing the app.
B0053O89K6|5.0|I loved this show since first aired. I missed the last season and this was excellent way to catch up. Such a good show. The product I received was in perfect condition and I am almost caught up. Will miss the show. The price was excellent and arrived prior to promised date. Excellent service.
0316286850|5.0|This book was given to me a LOOOONG time ago as a gift.<br />Best how to book on make-up ever!<br /><br />I lent it to a friend - who I know suspect believed I gave it to her.  Needless to say, the book was never returned.<br />So....I bought myself another copy.<br /><br />How often do you purchase a book TWICE!!
0345803493|5.0|Enjoyed the first book of this series, Fifty Shades of Gray, and this book promises<br />to be just as interesting.  I've just started it and it definitely holds your interest
B0088W4YTK|5.0|This is an awesome series that was cancelled way ahead of its time, but at least we got 5 good seasons
0783233477|5.0|I've seen this movie before and liked it well enough to buy it for my collection.  Love the story and<br />the acting of Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.  Didn't care for Claire Forlani because her eyes<br />drive me crazy.  This movie is a remake of the old  &#34;Death Takes a Holiday&#34; with Fredrick March.
B008N1LL42|5.0|Anyone who enjoys an action type movie will enjoy it.  It far exceeded what I was expecting from the normal &#34;Invading Alien&#34; sort of movie with a great story and surprise turn of events.
1451695195|5.0|Book was received in a very short time.  Book was packed well and in new condition.  Interesting book. I've only scanned thru it and am anxious to read it in entirety.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I can't believe it's over!  I wish there was another one to follow! Heard there might be a movie if so I will be seeing it!!!!
B0000073NC|3.0|Probably the best of the Scorpions earliest works, just the right amount of psychedelic influences from Uli Jon Roth.<br />I too, need a million....
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Keeps you guessing good skills for my kids to learn. Very effective keeping them entertained. Definitely a great game for 10 and up.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I need my glasses to play on the 7 inch screen, maybe it is better on the bigger screen.  word
B0011FL7FA|5.0|Across the Universe covers are better than Beatles originals. I Am The Walrus was kind of weird, but the rest was fantastic.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Really enjoy the variety of stations and the extensive amount of podcasts available. I really like that I am able to follow my favorite talk show host who left Chicago--and now I listen to his show in Minneapolis.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|it takes you through a simple stor, well written and entertaining, meanwhile you wait for something or someone andhave some time to loose.
1596680296|5.0|I had set a goal to learn how to knit socks-why I am not sure. I saw this book on Amazon and was impressed after reading just a few pages on the review. I purchased this book and needles off another site at the same time. I followed each set of directions and inside of about 8 hours I had finished one sock from start to finish!!! Not only did it look like the pictures but it actually fit. I have now started the matching sock!
B002PJL85K|5.0|I love the dry British humor. I remember this movie from the early eighties. I wasn't into fantasy/adventure then, but now it is all I read. I can see where Peter got his clues from the Ring series.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I love all things Les Mis...........It's about the show for me, not just the performers.<br />I suppose I have performers I 'enjoy' more than others, but it really is about Les Mis.  Not them.<br />:)
B002W5UVSM|5.0|I viewed a biography on the author on TV the other day, and frankly, his tragic suicide and the fight his mother put up to have this book published fascinated me. It peaked my interest, so I went and bought the digital version. I frankly didn't quite know what to expect, so I really didn't have any expectations except one of the fascination of his personal story.<br /><br />The title fits the characters perfectly. Everyone of them. It was hilarious, entertaining, and kept me reading until I was finished. I'm glad I saw that story on the author's life, or else I would have never known about this book. This book is a must read for anyone, whether you live in New Orleans, or know a group of dunces and can relate. My one wish is that the author could have had this published and gotten the recognition he deserved before he took his life. Maybe it would have prevented his suicide and we could still be reading his works today.
B001B1T7BU|5.0|the Dvd was in great condition. I bought it for my dog so that she would get more exercise. She runs to the TV set when the puppies and other dogs bark
0765325950|5.0|I'm an avid Wheel of Time fan and this doesn't disappoint. I've been waiting, like everyone else, for this release for so long I was afraid I would forget where the last book left off, but it picks up seamlessly. I am about 3/4 of the way done, and am trying not to rush it. Brandon Sanderson is an amazing author, and the story is absolutely epic. Happy reading!!! :)
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I think it was a very good game. the lady that did the dialog spoke in edible words that you could under stand. the find the object was hard.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|I just thought I would add my own two cents to this movie review section.  This is such a wonderful film for the entire family!  My children saw this movie when it first came out and they loved it, but we never bought the movie.  Well after a discussion with my 16 year old daughter one evening I decided to change that and bought the movie via instant video.<br /><br />Now all three of my kids, ages 16, 12 and 9 all watch this movie over and over and they laugh as they repeat the lines of the characters.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm not one to like many movies, and animated movies even less.  I'd much rather read a book than watch a movie.  But I have to admit this is a favorite of mine.  Ellen DeGeneres totally makes the whole movie with her ditsy character.  Somehow I can even envision her in the sound booth speaking into a mic with her facial expression as she speaks Dory's lines.<br /><br />I love this film and I'm really glad I bought it for my kids to enjoy over and over.<br /><br />I hope your family enjoys it as much as mine has.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love games like this! I had a great time playing it I couldn't even put it down!<br />I got it when it was free but, definitely worth the price!
B006C45MRE|5.0|It's a very unique take on cowboy and aliens and the plot kept us interested. I would differently watch again, due to so much action that sometimes you miss everything going on in a movie. I'm not a Daniel Craig fan, however he was watchable in this movie.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|as a catholic i love this movie , it is very clear and play good, the life of christ refresh my belief ..
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book mirrors book IV, jumping back in time and tracking the progress of the other half of the characters who were left out of book IV.  This book offers a little more action after book III, which is nice!
0812982622|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son was the most well written book I have read in a very long time. Icould totally imagine every aspect of the book which was compelling, interesting and a real eye opener given the articles I have read in the news currently. You will enjoy this book and pass it on.
B003IY49S4|5.0|Perfect gift for a jazz lover!!!! The CDs come in little sleeves that fit so well in the compact-sized box.  It is a wonderful set.  Great selection of albums.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Not a movie for kids....but the premise would have better received by a kid. It had a few very funny moments but overall the movie was just plain silly and not in a good way. VERY glad I got it for $1.99!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I very much enjoy the characters and the setting. I look forward to it every week. If you are UK fan you must give it a chance.
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|I have loved all of the Reacher books right from the start. The only movie I have ever liked Tom Cruise in was \\"Cocktail\\", where he played an arrogant jerk.<br /><br />I have NOT watched the \\"Reacher\\" movie. I did see some previews and watching Mr. Cruise take Jack Reacher's persona and turn it into a smarmy wise-cracking jerk was enough to convince I did not need to waste my $.<br /><br />Then there are the basic differences in the 2 men. (Hey, after 17 books, Reacher is real.)<br /><br />Reacher is 1) blond<br />  2) 6 foot 5<br />  3) 220 to 240 lbs<br />  4) genius level intelligence.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is: none of the above.<br /><br />And can never be Reacher.
B004UHSB5A|5.0|This is my favorite time passer on my kindle!  It isn't just a mindless game..you do have to do some strategizing.
1426209584|5.0|A Great Book to have if you're into exotic birds<br />or Birds of Paradise.  A Good price and great<br />pictures of amazing birds.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Very fun and exciting<br />If you let your kid try it it helps them manage with money and have fun.You can breed<br />cross-breed and decorate
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Our whole family loves this movie. Everyone that I have talked to loves this movie. And for the price, its a winner in my book!!!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Arrived on time and as expected. Great savings as compared to big box retailers! I would definitely recommend this as a kid's must have library edition.
0375842209|5.0|WARNING: This review may contain spoilers.<br /><br />As a rule, I give a book at least 50 pages to really get into it and this one was no different.  From the beginning it was clear that Zusak had written this book in a completely different style from what I am use to.  As soon as I picked up the flow of the book, it worked.  Written in the voice of \\"death\\"  gave the topic of this novel a voice like any we have seen before.<br /><br />I have read The Diary of Anne Frank, watched various TV programs about the holocaust, been to the Holocaust Museum (which I didn't actually make it through, I couldn't handle it) and actually skipped the movie Schindler's List.  No matter how many times I read or hear about the German Nazi, it never ceases to make me sick every single time.  I will never understand the horrific things that went on.  The Book Thief was just as hard to read, yet I couldn't put it down.  I always felt so awful for the Jews who had to suffer such tragedy for no reason.  I don't understand how the Germans could follow such a hateful man. How they couldn't see what a horrible horrible man Hitler really was.  Though now I have an empathy for those Germans who were powerless to stop what was happening.  To those, like Hans Hubermann, who had to look at their feet just to survive.  For the kindness that those types of people showed by hiding Jews in their houses, tossing a loaf of bread even though they knew how dangerous that could be.<br /><br />Even Death has a heart.  I loved this line in the book.  Since it was narrated by Death, you think it would give this book a heartless feel, but it was actually the other way around.  When the bombs his Himmel street  (I cried)  - he stood beside the beds of those children and kissed their cheeks goodnight.  He cried taking Rudy.  I think we need to give death a lot more credit than we do.  Why?  Because even Death has a heart.<br /><br />I know this review went longer than I had anticipated.  Sometimes there are just books that just touch you in a way that you don't expect.  There have been very few that have touched me the way this one has.  I lived in the book. I got to know these characters and loved them like family and was devastated when each and every one of them died.  I was happy for Liesel in the end.  I had empathy for death.<br /><br />\\"I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right\\" - The Book Thief - Last Line.  Zusak, you made them  right.<br /><br />Overall, I give his book an A+
B004GHNIRK|3.0|A  wonderful  story  filled with unforgettable characters and  detailed scenery.  It  argues  the for the wrong in what is thought to be  right and for the right in what is thought to be wrong.
0765325950|5.0|I just finished this book a few days ago, and I have to say it is probably my favorite out of the series. It is fast paced, full of action, and a lot of twists and turns that I've come to expect from this series. I loved the book, the series, and sad to have to see it end..
B007D2XSW0|4.0|this is a cool app. but when i save the changes i did i dont know were it goes too. and if i want to share it to imstagram or something i dont know were to find it. otherwise it is really cool. works great on my kindle fire.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I read this book after seeing and reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  It was just as exciting as the movie.  The twists and turns were unexpected and clever.  I enjoyed the characters and the way the every day details were woven in with quite bizarre situations
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie was really funny. Your typical no brainer chick flick. I will be buying this movie for our collection.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|This was one of Denzel Washington's best performances!  Definitely Oscar material. We rarely pay to rent a PPV but wanted to see this at home and are glad we did. Worth every one of the 5 stars as I rated it!
B00APJLFEG|3.0|This was a really cute show.  I thought that it was something that all ages could watch.  My daughter who is 11 loved it.  We actually had to rent this twice because she loved it so much.  I would definately reccomend this as a good family night movie night.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Compared to the other Kindle cases available, this is just as good as the $40-50 versions.  The custom fit is perfect.  I'm just hoping it lasts with the constant opening and closing of it.  I'm pleased with it and feel it was a good value.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This book tells about a religious man's love of aviation and his life as a German WWII fighter pilot. It focused mostly on the German side. The book tells history from a personal point of view. Well written and researched
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Paulo Coelho's novel is an instant classic about a young man's journey to discover his purpose in life and his place in the universe. A great read for a wide audience.
0425252868|5.0|Should you like WWII aviation history by those who lived through it, you will find this work spellbinding and heartfelt.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|For anyone considering a good read on how habits work this is an incredible book that opens your eyes on your own habitual shortcomings.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|The game is fun but the controls do not work on the last level. I cannot get him to touch the left wall.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is so addictive and I have learned so much. What a wonderful app. this has been so much fun!
B00AZLBIAA|2.0|Don't waste your time..used space on my Kindle.. THIS APP IS ONLY FOR FUN just could not find anything fun about this app!! Deleted..
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am completely hooked on this series.  Maggie Smith  is wonderful!  I read that Shirley Mc joined the 3rd season.  I can hardly wait to watch two of my favorite actresses work together.
B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades Trilogy is a delight.  I wasn't sure I was going to like this kind of book  but the more I read the 1st book the more  wanted to continue.  It might be a  dream fantasy but it brings back emotions that were hidden deep inside.<br /><br />I have recommended it to all of my friends.
B002HWBS96|4.0|I love this opera, but I much prefer the Met 2009 production.  The cast, costuming, and stage set  much superior to this<br /><br />German production.  Why the DVD I prefer is not available, I cannot imagine since that version was telecast on PBS.<br /><br />The cast ant production is so superior to the one offered.  How I would love to have  the DVD of the production I so<br /><br />admire.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a good way to get AWESOME ideas about anything. Ideas I would have never thought about and now I can try and use.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|Very well scripted movie with much action and adventure included with the ending to the movie as one that is great where the planets were saved.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this app. Works great on Kindle Fire. My kids love it too. Keeps you busy but to advance quicker, in app purchases required.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|No glitches, great graphics and fun to play on my Galaxy tab. The puzzles are somewhat challenging and include a skip option if needed. Full version worth the $$!!
B002M9WW30|5.0|This set put all the Rock's together in one of the best collection of movies you could ever want.<br />I had most of them in dvd but was considering getting them in Blue -ray  when this set became available.<br />The last one may be the best of them all.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This part really introduces Carrie Kelley(the new Robin) quite well and shows how Bruce Wayne comes out of retirement to reclaim the city he once knew so well, Gotham.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love this game.  Fun to play.  We play in groups to see who can solve the puzzle in the least amount of moves.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Seriously this is what Batman needs to be like in the movies, a much darker and by darker I mean bloodier and more gritty version of Batman.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is fun free great for kids who want a horse you can take picture of your horse and enter competitions.
B005LAII80|3.0|Much better than the Sly version and full of action and some very good plot points. Just way too much slo-mo even though they use a drug in the movie called the latter. But I'd give it a shot if I were you, great movie with Karl Urban and Oliva Thirlby making another appearance since Juno's best friend in the movie Juno.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I expected this to be like Twilight, but this book had dimension!  The characters had personality!  Great YA novel unlike the Twilight series.
B009MO57H6|1.0|I chose this rating cause I thought I'd give it a chance cause I was somewhat a fan of the other ones, at least the first two but this was one of the worst films I've ever seen.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The Downton Abbey series has everything a human drama needs to make it exciting....love, jealousy, power, intrigue....it was so difficult to FIND season 2 so I am grateful to Amazon for hosting it. It was delivered quickly, seamlessly, and in super clear HD.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice big keys! Easy to use.Iwould highly recommendit.I was using the calculator on my cell phone before and this app is somuchbetter
1451613512|5.0|I purchased this book after I saw the Showtime series. The book has so much valuable information about U.S. history. It's a great read and great book to own.
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|I like hidden object and mystery games. I mean I REALLY do. But this one fell flat. I have a Galaxy Note 2 which has a 5.5 inch screen, and it was still very difficult to see the objects, even when zooming in. There was no room to explore the landscape of the game, the story was not that good, nor was the dialogue.<br /><br />If you like good mystery games and hidden objects, and even some good puzzles, look into the games by Big Fish. The Empress of the Deep games are still top of my list, along with those made by Fire Maple.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story, reminds you that great love stories are possible. Good fast read for a cold winter night with a glass of wine!
B00846F1YW|1.0|I forgot that this developer made the Magic Academy game that disappointed me so. I like games that have a little more free form in them. If you've ever played Myst on the PC, then you know what I'm talking about. This game was just reading poor dialogue, or rather tapping through it to get to the actual hidden object part, then more bad dialogue, then moving to the next scene. No choice at what you do or where you're going.<br /><br />Seriously, Nevosoft needs to take a hint from Fire Maple and Big Fish. Check out their game set ups and then develop something a little more interesting.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I have not been a big fan of the recent remakes from 80s/90s films and I was not expecting much out of Dredd but was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The new film is a different storyline from the original.  It's a much darker film than the original.  The story was simple but will keep you interested and entertained.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I keep it in a box w/Christmas music and decorations.  It used to be broadcast every year on TV Thanksgiving weekend but it tends to be the colorized version which I don't care for.
B00BECZPI0|1.0|This is what we waited for? What a major disappointment ! This is one chapter you can save your money on and you wont miss a thing
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Usually Griffin's books are so compelling I don't want to put them down.  This one I left lying around for long periods and read other books in between.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Not sure why it didn't get nominated for an Oscar but whatever their loss.<br /><br />I have enjoyed this product thoroughly but I have found a dud with it. When you download this on to Itunes BEWARE! You will put it on your Ipod and discover that &#34;The Song of the Lonely Mountain&#34; and all the rest afterwards will not download well on your Ipod. Me and my sister both are having trouble with that otherwise its great! Should play well on your computer and in a cd player or boom-box (if any of you still have one of those haha). Great soundtrack!!!
B0054W4JQK|5.0|A keep you on the edge of your seat story! Imagine falling asleep each night and forgetting everything about your life before you were young?..... Christine has woken up at forty seven years old next to a stranger who tells her he is her husband every morning. To help her pick up the pieces of her life, she decides to write a journal.<br /><br />She soon discovers the horror of why she lost everything and begins to doubt the one person who wakes up with her each morning.....
B00A18KCSQ|5.0|The Foals continue their hot streak with Holy Fire, perfecting the insistent dance-rock rhythmic magic that makes them so fun--but at the same time, the driving guitars and melodic invention keep the album fresh and more than just a dance album alone.  Yannis Philippakis voice is urgent and smoky, with a lazy slide that invites you in but then won't let you go.  Inhaler is an early standout track, it was a single in the UK and it is absolutely impossible to listen to at anything less than maximum volume.  It begs you to take the floor.  My Number was also an early single from the album, and has a really funky guitar figure and  a relentlessly catchy beat. Overall the album has a sense of busy-ness--there is always something exciting happen, leaving you waiting for what is coming next, knowing that there is no way that they can shock or surprise you again--and then they do.  Holy Fire is my jumping on point for the Foals, and it is one of my favorite new finds.  Pick it up if you like 80's inflected dance funk delivered with creativity, style, and a double dose of attitude.  Big fun.
B0053VKP8S|4.0|It does exactly what I wanted it to do and was a lot less expensive way to do it than what the guy at best buy was trying to tell me I needed.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I think is an amazing book twist left and to always keep me guessing. I can't wait till house of Hades comes out.
B000I0QL82|2.0|some great dancing, of course, but the black face number was appalling and the plot line was silly. i can se why they took &#34;white christmas&#34; and gave it a better vehicle.
B003CIG7AE|5.0|I put off buying this CD for over a year, not sure if it would be something I'd like or not. But once I finally bought it and listened to the whole thing I was hooked. Plenty of lovely, shimmering folk-rock songs with a nice pop vibe. The sort of songs that stick in your head and transport you to marvelous imaginary places. Really, the \\"feel-good\\" factor of this album is very, very high. Not sure how to properly classify this sound, but the sound is refreshing. I'm now very eager to hear other CDs from this impressive band.
6305882592|5.0|mordant and depressed harold has his spirit awakened by lively, free spirit maude- extremely funny and moving with a beautiful soundtrack by cat stevens
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very captivating! Right down to the last few pages. I would have  liked an alternate ending but still a good suspenseful read!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Emotional Overkill<br />I really enjoyed the content of the book overall, but  I thought  Anastasias  character was too emotional and not submissive enough.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 was just as absorbing as the first two seasons. It kept my complete attention and I enjoyed seeing the characters develop.
B005LAII80|5.0|Straight up amazing action movie.  If you are into A to B action of the 80s with some sweet one liners and all kinds of fantastic sequences then this movie is for you.  Use of 3D is brilliant in this film as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you are married, then have your wife read this trilogy ( You will be glad she did) !!!!! Men will enjoy it too!!!! Great ideas to put the spark back in your relationship!!!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|These shows are the greatest! I recommend them extremely! I'm so glad I watched them they are soo good and couldn't stop!! They are like the greatest ever!!!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I needed to hear the voice of someone in the story who understood from experience that life is created with purpose and that to be able to live beyond your own needs is reason enough to live. Will loved the life he could control--self-determination was his only purpose in living. If he could not have it his way, he would not accept it. Once again self was somehow made to seem enough in life, and trust and vulnerability were diminished. To put the needs of others before your own has become a foreign concept to many people.<br /><br />Do not knock it before you try it. My adult life has been spent in a measured, intentional dedication to giving wind to others' wings. Will missed out on the most satisfying purpose in life--loving another more than you love yourself.
0425252868|5.0|my husband is a history buff, he said it was a very good<br /> book  he read it on one weekend
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I didn't want to continue as it did seem hopeless for me at times.  Once again I endured to the end.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|needs to be updated im outta puzzles... otherwise its a fun game very addictive!!!! so i give it four stars..
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|manages to keep everyones attention. 4, 7, 11, 18, 40 and 41 year olds all loved this movie. great job.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Loved the third season again the show shows the divide of upper and lower class slowly changing. The ending sad makes sure I am looking forward to season 4.<br />Costume and sencery was fanatastic. Love the show if youe like period drama this is a show you should not miss
0763644765|4.0|Before our daughter was potty trained, she enjoyed this book very much. It was clear that some of it help prepare her for the potty and underwear and other expectations.<br /><br />You may want to preview the book to make sure it jives with your potty training method. The only negative thing for me was the depiction of time sitting on the toilet: reading, waiting, sleeping. Many people don't recommend letting or making the child sit like that. I didn't find that it affected our daughter's expectations, though.
1451673442|5.0|I love this book, it has some repetition from the Secret but its so positive the kick i need every day!
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I've read about Ivan for more than two decades and waited impatiently for HIS story. He's finally emerged from being just the funny side kick character into a full &#34;hero.&#34; And Bujold has managed to keep faith with the readers.<br /><br />I just wish she'd write more stories about Miles, Ivan and the whole crew. I'm still upset about the Admiral but guess I'll get over it.<br /><br />This is the series I always recommend to romance readers who want to dip into space opera and this book plus A CIVIL CAMPAIGN are a perfect match to CORDELIA'S HONOR.
B005S9EJ14|2.0|I really hate to pan this movie, because I loved the premise and most of the actors for other work.  But, this cast never gelled and the plot dragged on. Worse, the set was depressing and it never got much better.  In fact, it made the whole idea of retiring in India seem much less appealing, and that was only from the visual and sound track.<br /><br />I found the entire movie a waste of time. I kept hoping for a memorable scene that would make the experience more positive, but it never came.  This isn't the worse movie ever, but it hardly is worth your $10 to watch it.
B000UJ48UO|3.0|This movie has several verions on blue ray. If do not care much about bonus feature, this disc is to buy. Do not expect much and compare its AV qualifty with the latest movie on blue ray disc, but this is a great war movie, like the Platoon,  to add into your collection of Vietnam war.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Great film about a global icon. There were interviews with people that the public has never seen before- for example with Marley's paternal relatives,  and a 'baby mother' that many have never known. Highly recommend this.
B003YHSE7W|3.0|This disc's AV quality matches the Iron Man 1, but I like the first movie better. Both Iron man 1 & 2 are choice to show off on hugh front projection screen for sure. The reduced selling price is acceptable.
1416909532|5.0|Changed my life by gaining knowledge of the male simple mind. If he wants to be with you, he will do anything he can to contact you. Period.
B0021L8V0W|3.0|This video can to pass your time if have nothing to do. Good AV transfer. Price is right under $10.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is very good game I think everyone should play this game it's very funny I love subway surfers my baby cousin play's it to
B0046MOVD0|3.0|A video to pass your time at night if you have nothing much to do. Picture quality is great for the selling price of less than $10.
B009R89AA2|5.0|This book is good because it is funny and it is not to long like other  books could you recommend any good but not to long books I'm 11:) :)
B008N9AAQ4|4.0|Great AV quality, similar to Baraka. If you own Baraka and just looking for Great AV Quality disc for showing off to your front projection and sound system, You can skip this disc. Baraka is sufficient. But if you really enjoy high definition video, like me, Samara should be in your collection. The last video clip of the &#34;Thousand arms Budist&#34; is a must watch performance, but too short.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Expected more after reading critically acclaimed reviews.<br />Lead actors appeared aged and tired. The usual debonair Bond was missing<br />In this one.
B00APJLEGA|1.0|Just not entertaining or well written.<br /><br />Eveyone can't get it right like Pixar.<br /><br />It really makes you appreciate their stories so much more.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Fun combined with frustration... challenging and entertaining.  Keeps me away from the TV and up late at night. It's well worth the price!!!
B007THA4FI|4.0|I never write reviews, but I did feel compelled, having just finished listening to this book, to write one. JK Rowling is AMAZING in her ability to tell a tale with interesting and unpredictable turns of plot, believable and painfully human characters, all while tackling themes of privilege, obligation and the complexities of the human heart. Beyond mere entertainment, this novel is impressive both in the scope of its ambition, and the dexterity of its execution. While it might take a good 50 pages or so to settle into its quiet rhythm (the only reason it has 4 rather than 5 stars) it is completely worth it. Do yourself a favor and read this book!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game. Makes me use my memory retention, hand-eye coordination, and pattern recognitin. It's a great pastime and is relaxing. Not stressful at all.
B005HPY8LU|5.0|I love this cd,doesnt matter what song is playing as long as its playing. I use it a lot for exercising. My daughter loves it too.
0316227706|5.0|Great coffee table book!  We have this out in front of our sofa and have had so many people comment on it! We are obviously dog lovers and the pictures are absolutely amazing! I have two very photogenic terriers and have some wonderful pics of them at work and at home, but the playful nature of Seth's pics are amazing, his work is outstanding!  If you are lucky enough to get him to do pics of your four legged babies...wow, what a treasure!  I think he probably has as much fun as they do!
B0099114WO|4.0|Igot it as a gift for my mom. she loves it. says its really funny Im glad she likes it.I  never saw it.
B007FSF1FE|5.0|Just do it. Honestly, I bought the album and now I have to do the websites work selling it to other people? Should I ask for some money back?
B00026L7O0|5.0|my favorite of all the dr.lector movies,nice to see the sweet side of the phsycopathic cannibal serial killer. there's no jodie foster this time but clarice starling being played by julianne moore is quite appropriate. She's good in this part.
0316227706|5.0|Feeling down?  Buy this book!  It can't help but lift your spirits!!  The pictures are brilliant and adorable.  It is like watching the Puppy Bowl or Too Cute, but underwater.
B004FGMV0W|4.0|every song on this cd is good. my daughter really wanted it so i got it for her and we both enjoy listening to it
B004UID2LC|5.0|You can watch videos that you save, even without wifi (need to save first)  I've also saved music as an mp3 and you have full songs for free! I would get this app no matter the other bad reviews. This has more benifits than thought.
B004LWZW24|4.0|great movie with lots of very scary and exciting suprises ,but was very dark and extremely hard to see, but all and all a great movie worthy of a part 2
B00872ARMO|5.0|I first heard Rebecca Ferguson on my TV Music Channel quite by accident.  I am someone who rarely listens to the radio due to the lack of true music there.  I was intrigued by her voice and obvious roots in R&B. I sampled additional tracks of Heaven on Amazon and was willing to take the risk and purchased it.  I was completely satisfied and even more impressed with the live and acoustic versions of her songs.  Would love to catch her in concert.  If you are a real music lover, particularly R&B then some faith will be restored that there is good music being made out there.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|The songs on this  cd are very annoying that I do not recomend  to anybody you could hear the entire song just by the chouros
B0040I09RM|5.0|Man this is a great show. I was late to watch just watched season 1. Looking forward to season 2
B00846F1YW|3.0|fun hidden pictures game. frustrating when the item is hidden in an area with the menu over. A little too much storyline.
B00009P1O2|5.0|This was for my husband. He is a fan of Queen and really enjoyed the music and video. It brought back teenage memories.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Running plex just fine on 2 other devices. Changed settings to quicksilver which works but crashes every 5 minutes. I'm guessing an update will eventually get it going on the kindle fire.<br /><br />Edit: I used the default setting and unchecked \\"Enable Direct Streaming\\" under advanced setting.  Works perfectly now!
0671015206|5.0|I bought this a few years ago and learned some interesting tips. I have just recently read it again and found new things to help improve our station in life. I am a new business owner and found it most helpful this second time around.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. It has several great sounds that you can mix. It also haa a good variety of sounds. For a free app it's great!!
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I bought the battery grip for Christmas and love it. It doesn't add that much weight, plus I can take videos and pictures all day.
B0012BQ60O|5.0|Another great high quality toy. These items, I'm sure, will last for years! My grandson loves it! Thanks so much!
B004SOR4H6|2.0|I don't use Twitter a great deal however I do not like the fact that Twitter for Android does not have a &#34;Log Out&#34; or &#34;Sign Off&#34; feature like what is on Twitter on my Computer. Once you &#34;Sign In&#34; the only way to close it is to completely remove it from your device. Bad Idea. and I did just that, I deleted it from both my Kindle Fire and my Android smart phone. I will not re-install it until I can &#34;Log Off&#34; when i choose.
1416914285|5.0|A wonderful book filled with action, drama, mystery, and of course a wonderful romance. For anyone who loves Sherrilyn  Kenyon this is a must read!
B0006J28MI|4.0|I watched this movie as a kid and enjoyed it. I purchased this DVD for my grandmother when her VHS copy broke. She is happy with it.
B008LZHA3G|1.0|although certainly not his best.Tempest is Dylan all the way and the title cut takes you on board that ill fated ship<br />excellent
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Wow I have had like so much fun with this app already! 5 stars all the way and I highly reccomend it :D
B0018BB21G|1.0|this album and Lsd introduced me to mind expansion in the 60s and now even without the acid ,my mind soars<br />wow is all i can say
B0083SBJXS|5.0|In the beginning the alien villain is a little corny, but the actor who plays Loki is just spectacular, he is just great, please keep him on for the rest of the series.<br />The very beginning is just fantastic the arrival of Loki and the cube, its very interesting a great introduction, the colors are just so rich and deep, the blue ray transfer was just marvelous, the surround decodeing DTS-HD was stellar, truly great, as was the destruction of the base in the beginning. The special effects are fantastic, the attention to detail, the architecture, the costumes, the fight choreography, the music all top notch. Nick Fury's character is just not that believable, he needs to be more natural, more convincing, but he does the job, just like to see him show us a man who is burdened with incredibly difficult choices, a very great responsibility to ensure national security and to deal with exceptional, remarkable and uncontrollable individuals and situations as well as all the secrets he must keep. There is a wealth of information available for him to use to being the edge he needs to make Nick stand out.<br />  The black widow intro was a little over the top, but the gymnastics were amazing, except for the head-butt, I don't think Natasha's head is so hard she can head butt people and not be knocked out, lets keep it more believable in part two, but yes the martial arts and the lady who does her stunts must be kept she is great. Also please give her a black costume, it is Black Widow, not Grey widow and it would be nice to have a shiny black, tight fitting costume or atleast just black, please for the rest of the series. Besides that she fends for herself, she has to be a full throttle spy chick, so please up the ante, think Angelina Jolie in Salt only not evil.<br />  Captain America should keep the leather jacket he had in the movie of the same name, also he looks less bulky than in the movie, was it due to special effects or did he loose weight?. The Blue costume shouldbe a little more Navy blue, and should be like chainmail as in the comics, it has always been this way, why did you change it? I mean this is one mistake that Hollywood always makes, if you are going to change something it should only be for the better. Thor looked great, the re-working on the costume is fantastic, certainly warranted (like the Toby Mcguire Spiderman costume both the red and blue and the black costumes were beautiful, and that's the way to go) that's the way you do it, please make it look better for the rest of the series, I mean its Capt. America for goodness sake. In his starring Movie, they really got to the heart of the character it was well done and they did use the leather coat over the suit which just made him look really cool, and wear the helmet, just looked, real, as someone who is believable, who would wear this in public, something like what a navy seal or green beret or a super soldier would wear. Like Stark says \\" ...out of all the people in this room A. is wearing a spangly outfit and B. not of use.\\" Please do him justice, address both those issues and take a look at some of the drawings from the Ultimatate Avenger mini series which is the inspiration of this movie. By the way the special agent Phil Coulson, who is trying to get his signature on the trading cards was funny but also something important because he is a legend, it shows his effect on regular people and how they react to him, and that's an angle you can definitely use, because regular people relate to him and this is one of his strengths and they would rally to him, follow him, he's a leader, like in the stand off with Loki and Iron man at the museum.<br />Also Iron Man I would love to see them stick more to the red and gold costume not silver, but the suit is amazing I'll give you that, way to go Hollywood.<br />  The humor between the characters, Stark \\"...that man is playing Gallager, he though no one would notice\\" nice or  \\"...oh I do ... I understood that reference\\"Captain America and the flying monkeys comment was funny as heck. Or Banner \\"I don't think we should be focusing on Loki, that guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you can smell crazy on him\\". The interplay between all the characters, their history is all just stellar especially the stand off just before Loki's plan is set off, when Banner graps Loki's spear was just intense, as was Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America's confrontation \\"...take that suit off what are you?\\"  Stark \\"...Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.\\"  Capt \\"...always a way out, you may not be a threat but you better stop pretending to be a hero.\\"  Stark \\"...A hero? Like You? You're a laboratory experiment Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle\\" beautifully scripted even more beautifully acted by these stars! Stark and Banners philosophical views, all of it gets to the heart of the characters, please keep this coming in part 2 and 3. However the alien villain is just not cutting it, he's over the top, please make him less dramatic, more alien, more like a general less cartoonish, here's the thing, something like species or predator etc. Please don't make Thanos look like a rubber doll, he looked a little comical, Thanos is a major player, I would say make him look more realistic, the flesh tones or go CGI on him, just please make him look cool, cause it would suck if he didn't, and please make him act like the powerful villain he is, if Loki was great then Thanos who is even greater than the Asgardians should be on another level altogether (I know he is Marvels version of DC's Darkseid (the original dark GOD) who is equally and visually stunning and incredible). Please don't let us down in this, take your time with developing him in the film, because if you do, I think DC will ace it and blow you away with Darkseid.  Also bringing the actors from the other movies as supporting characters, which should not be killed, a great touch, allows us to see that their lives are a continuation of their story, nice touch.<br />  The battle with Iron Man and Thor and Captain is just incredible and every fan boys dream, thank you!<br />  The special effects in the movie are great, the technology, the Hulk looks just amazing! The action sequences are fantastic. The shield Heliport is truly beautiful. Once the action starts after the argument when all the characters confront each other which was just beautifully done, all the characters shined, we need this kind of dynamic interplay all through the rest of the series, these characters are like firecrackers, no, make that lightning bolts, their star power can hardly be contained and that's just what makes it unique and super exciting, wow! Keep it coming, I'm impressed !!! Certainly a movie I will buy for my library, Well done!  The face off between the heavy hitters Hulk and Thor was just Thrilling ! WOULD have loved to see a longer battle, Thor didn't have his armor on as he did after he landed in the field when he fell from the helicarrier, he'll need every bit of an edge against the Hulk, maybe in part 2 look forward to it, WOW!  (just one thing though about Thor, didnt they offer children sacrifices to him back in the barbarian age, in real life /history, this is blaspheme and a little disturbing, it must be adressed, explain he is not a god just long lived immortal alien, who were confused as these gods of old, because what hero be this?!) The flesh tones on the Hulk and his whole look is just soo impressive, the raw, power insane! It's just so frightening to have the Hulk be so uncontrollable, unstoppable and so dangerous that I definitely found myself rooting for anyone to win, it's a very frightening to have that thing running around uncontrollable. You can hardly breath with all the stuff going on, insane, crazy, love it, do not dare to stop this momentum in the next few films. Yet please keep it balanced, let the characters keep having a chance to shine as they have done,every part of it was just so incredible.<br />Iron man may need to step in the ring and have a little throw down with the Hulk even if just briefly that would be a sight to see, if he can take on Thor then let him test his \\"metal\\" against the Ultimate Avenger! Ho-Ho !<br />  The entire alien invasion was just wonderfully orchestrated.<br />DR. Banner's character firstly was not played by the actor in the second version of the Hulk movie, big disappointment, Edward Norton did a beautiful job as Banner. Second I always felt that the idea was to have a small gentle man as in the 70's version with Bill Bixby who is a pacifist but then when placed in a life threatening situation where no other options are available the monster breaks free to punish the evil doers. This is a very critical part of the interplay of the two opposing personalities within Bruce banner and it seems to have been lost much to our loss.<br />  Just as Marvel and DC comics upon going corporate have abandoned the comics code authority which ensured that the comics would follow certain important guidelines to protect out young children from objectionable situations and story lines. After its abandonment in the 90's you have seen a much more violent streak of stories, ruthless and very controversial and certainly not acceptable such as the gay marriage in X-men comics of one of Alpha Flights characters. Comics are for children and I dont agree that allowing gay characters in the main stream is something that sends a message that is appropriate or should be entertained with children. This is not to persecute the gay community, nor judge them as since many were molested as children and other unacceptable things that caused problems for them. This is not something we can allow for our children, Marvel has lost its grip on reality and feels that because a small 1% of the people in power find such a thing acceptable that they will impose their view, wrong as it is on the rest of us. Once again I respect and do not judge the gay community, nor wish them any ill will, but many, especially those that experienced molestation must be wary of the deception of attempting to normalize what is not normal or acceptable. That said there are many gay people who are very kind and good people who are suffering in many ways due to their experiences, I bid you all respect and pray for you to obtain the peace you seek and wish you the best.
B00008QSA5|1.0|this is my seventh copy of this cd ,having played the previous 6 ,litterally to death.<br />season of the with is possibly my all time favorite cut on any cd
B00846F1YW|4.0|Great fun! Challenging but not so difficult to be frustrating! It's not too easy nor is it too hard either!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I never missed an episode of this masterpiece classic when aired on PBS. Yet, I loved owning the DVD's.  I bought all the 3 seasons and every now and then will watch it on my computer.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I am only on the third chapter, so am not sure how much will be getting for free.  What I have played so far is great! Good graphics and I also like the option to play UN timed game. If you like hidden objects game, this is a very good one.  I am playing on Kindle Fire Hd-runs smooth with clear crisp pictures.  Go for it and enjoy!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Amazing for something that bills itself as &#34;LifeProof&#34;:. The flap over the power connection broke in half, probably a flaw in the plastic, just closing it one day. Piece of over priced trash! Kids toys can witstand all kinds of abuse. Maybe one of those manufacturers should start making cases.
1416549447|5.0|As a(h-hmm!) older person that is new to running, I had already experienced my first running injury, and was constantly bothered by shin splints. I had been told that I was running wrong. I was &#34;heel striking&#34;. My body always hurt after running and it was so hard for me to find pleasure in running. I knew I had to somehow stop landing on my heels. But how? I had no idea. Thank goodness I bought &#34;ChiRunning&#34;! Now I understand why people like to run. It can be effortless and pain-free. No more shin splints, tired legs, sore muscles or aching hips. What a wonderful way to run. My only regret is not buying this book sooner.
0374214913|5.0|Reading this book was very interesting, step by step revealing the truth and secrets hidden in Mr. Penumbra's bookstore. I recommend reading it, you won't regret it.
0425264351|5.0|my first jack reacher after seeing the movie and i really liked it. did not want to put it down yet didn't want it to end. already passed it on to another fan.
0345505387|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of the Diana Gabaldon<br />series about Claire and Jamie will like this graphic<br />novel that retell about half the book in novel-style illustrations.<br />Great quality printing.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I am stuck in this game.  Can't find the proper device to allow me to continue, and the hint is just to go to the lock and open it.  I am unable to do that because the device that I need to get the key to open the lock is nowhere to be found.  Hmmmm.  I was looking for a &#34;search&#34; game, not a strategy game.  Oh well.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The only reason i give this movie a 4star instead of a 3 is because of the Flight scenes and Denzel was in it. However, i don't think the movie lived up tot he hype. It was a good story that provoked some thoughts about life.
0345803493|5.0|I was half thru the first one, and I knew I had to get the second book.  Read that in record time and then onto the 3rd
B0043UB0EI|4.0|It had a Slow beginning, lots of sex, blood and Violence but eventual Climax at end of Season 1. Overall, it was ok.
0345803507|5.0|I read the first two in record time.  Loved the ending.  My daughter read them after I did, and shared them with a coworker.
B00846F1YW|4.0|graphics are't as good as advertised. could do better on some scenes got stuck on one of them because of this problem
B005PK56TA|4.0|I chose 4 stars because I am not usually into the horror genre, but I gave it a try.  It's not bad.  It is creepy and thought provoking at times.  Not sure if I'm going to continue watching it or not, but if you're into this sort of thing, well,  you should check it out.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I love this Movie.  I think it has a great Message as well.  the product came just as expected, with the two different CD's.  I just wish it has the digital copy as well.
B00A8ZZ570|5.0|This is clearly outstanding jazz. Hadn't really heard much of Potter's work before except as a sideman. Won't try to add much to what has already been favorably described. My last 3 jazz CD purchases have been this one, Kurt Rosenwinkel's \\"Star of Jupiter\\" and Wayne Shorter's \\"Without A Net\\". It's only February but feel it'll be hard to find any better jazz releases the rest of the year.
B0089J29C6|5.0|This is a pretty good movie with three lovely ladies. This was filmed in Technicolor & Cinemascope. Also it is in the 2:55:1 Aspect Ratio which I'm glad to see rather than the traditional 1:85:1. This way you see more of the movie. I like that. I'm tired of all the chopped up movies. The color is rather nice as it is in Technicolor. Nothing better than this. The Blu-Ray is quite nice if I may say so, especially the outdoor scenes I thought. You only get Featurettes for Special Features. Kinda of chinzy if you ask me. Overall I am happy I got this movie. It is definitely better than the dvd. I had no problems with the audio either, although I listen with external speakers through an old stereo system. No Digital.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Samsara is a labor of love. The product of that labor is an exquisite, honest, depiction of thousands of years of humanity.<br /><br />Ron Fricke treats each capture of our existence as the work of art that it is; describing the cinematography as awe-inspiring is an understatement.<br /><br />In his review for the film, Ebert said that \\"Some of these places, structures, peoples and practices will not endure forever, and if this planet someday becomes barren and lifeless, these films could show visitors what was here.\\"<br /><br />If the world were to explode and we had one vessel to send humanity's legacy into space, it would make me happy to know that Samsara was on that craft.
1451683405|2.0|I bought this because I have recently watched a lot of Sam Harris' talks and debates, and while I thought he was sincere and smart, I didn't come away with a good sense of the foundation of his arguments. I eagerly anticipated reading a couple of his books to better understand his ideas.<br /><br />I checked The Moral Landscape out of the library, and I bought Free Will (it was so new it was not yet available from the library). Both books were disappointing. I didn't even finish TML. Harris can't seem to clearly articulate his arguments. I eventually got tired of following him around in logical and moral circles, and picked up something else, though I still think his ideas are intriguing.<br /><br />Free Will is essentially an expansion of one chapter of TML. It's short, with a lot of white space and big font. I did not check to be sure, but my sense is that a lot of the text was lifted directly from TML. Frankly, it feels like a rushed attempt to cash in on Harris' current notoriety as one of the &#34;Four Horsemen&#34;. Harris also has an odd habit of laying out hypothetical scenarios of evil (say, wartime atrocities) with a disturbing level of detail that I find off-putting.<br /><br /> In a word: Unnecessary. There is not enough new material here to warrant another book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the characters and what the story teaches me about English life in the early 20th century.  The subtle intrigue is addictive for me and my only complaint is that the seasons are far too short!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I liked it a lot. I feel a little biased because this book was written about the time when I was in high school so I felt very nostalgic reading it. It was fun. Reading the whole book as letters written to the mysterious stranger does at times get old, but the author still does an amazing job of telling the story. I am really looking forward to seeing the movie now.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was so good I just couldnt put it down!! Im waiting on the next one! I cant wait.
0345472322|5.0|Makes you think about your approach to situations.  A must read for educators of middle school children.  The idea of a child's approach to life because of a fixed or growth mindset.  It allows you an opportunity to recognize your personal approach to life as well.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a great book I just kept reading and reading couldnt put it down!!! I am waiting on the 3rd one now!
B004LROUNG|4.0|Quite a story with enough twists and turns to keep the pages turning.  And, yea, the good guys win. Keep them coming.
B009OJ01HA|4.0|Very good acting, with the contrast of the main character's personalities adding to the suspense and interest. Surprising ending and satisfying
111846446X|5.0|I purchased this book because of the stellar reviews - and it did not disappoint me.  I have had a RPi for about 2 months, and while I knew a many things about it, this book taught me much much more.  It is a great balance for a beginner, because it details all of the basics, and it is also a great desk reference.  Things are arranged logically, in most cases, and its easy to follow.  I think there were a few links that weren't 100%, but a quick search on google.com would get me where I needed to be. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I was eager to read this book because the first two were so enjoyable but was disappointed. It moved at a much slower pace than the other books and I missed hearing about my favorite characters. The new characters are not as interesting. The other books in this series left me eager to read more but, I'm debating about purchasing the next in the series.
B009X01ELC|4.0|The case protects the device well and having the option to stand it up vertically or horizontally is great.  My only negative so far is that if you open it like a book then it starts up with the display upside down. Of course it rotates eventually...
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Great price on the set, too.  Looking forward to buying Season 3 next.  Def go with the UK version - the special features are good as well.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It was good, but not as good as the first one. I like the new landscapes and minecarts, but not the emeralds. They make me feel like I'm cheating.
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|This is the closest we'll all get to a reunion.  At least, that's the conclusion I'm making myself come to.  Robert Plant has forever steered clear of playing with his former mates, and I feel it shows a bit in the first couple songs.  It's not until a couple songs into the set where he starts to get his steam.  By the time they hit &#34;In My Time of Dying&#34;, Plant almost seemed to remember why he loved being in this band.  His vocal chops are nowhere near the times of old, but that's to be expected.  Page sounds great on guitar, and JPJ is as amazing as ever.  And I'd be remiss not to mention Jason Bonham on the drums, who fills his dads shoes better than almost anyone could.<br /><br />The mix for me is a bit muddy for me, but it works for the most part.  The song selection is pretty great, it's amazing to hear Stairway all these years later, and &#34;Good Times Bad Times&#34; is a spectacular way to start the show.  While the set lacks all the acoustic greatness of songs like &#34;Going To California&#34;, &#34;That's The Way&#34; and &#34;Tangerine&#34;... it was clear the focus was balls out rock, which is a fair way to say goodbye.  That is, after all, how they said hello.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is totally addictive. It's also very fun. When ever I'm bored I play this game and have so much fun ! Even when I'm not bored I'll play it cause it's just that good !
B00608HMFW|5.0|Just have to love the brothers and their demons. Always something new and exciting. I purchased the complete seasons from 1-6 with Amazon very happy with the seller's item.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I have it linked up to my Facebook account ! Instead of my picture default from Facebook showing on the screen when I'm playing with my high score it has a picture of one of my friends from Facebook that has it linked up to his with his high score!! Why? Wtf! Please fix this !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|JUST GET IT!!!!!!! If you love horses, you WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!!!  Very fun and realistic too. Not going to say anything else because I don't want to ruin it for you!!!!!!! :)
B004GHNIRK|5.0|We've got hundreds of books BUT I never tire going back to my faves. And Les Miserables is one of them. I remember the first time I read this book. I was in secondary school then. Every time I reread it I discover something beautiful jumping out of the pages. LeMis is a good read. It brings back the era in the world's history when the so-called \\"enlightenment\\" started, when democracy versus monarchy faced-off.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Magic! These stories bring to mind the nature and reality of all life experience, the good and bad... We all face these delimnas within our own life experience...
B00838HRP2|1.0|I was sent a DVD that doesn't work in my DVD player it says wrong region. I want to know why they think this is acceptable. Now I'm stuck with a movie I can't watch.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Best game application, so fun to play. Great for the entire family, we love .mystery  type things so it was right up at the top of our list to try. This will challenge you! Only glitch I found is the penalty for random clicks. It takes away your time when zooming in or out or moving the picture. Highly recommended
B00BEDFF0W|1.0|Season 2, episode 13 \\"Reunion.\\"<br /><br />The acting is terrible, but I would suppose most people who watch this stuff already know this.<br /><br />The storyline is splintering even more. There will be no resolution as revenge is no longer the goal. A third season of nonsense is the goal.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I'm completely hooked on Fringe right now. It is an awesome Sci-Fi show, and I suggest it to everyone I know. Seriously, give this one a shot. I'm almost finished with Season 2 now and it only seems to get better and better.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|I'll not extend the praise for this brilliant album. Just listen to it, read most reviews and you'll get it.<br />I have one question tough, where is the vinyl version?
B0011Z7ILM|5.0|This is my favorite A7X album so far.  I've been listening to it very heavily since I bought it, and I only like it more and more.  If you are a fan of hard rock, this is a must buy, in my opinion.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Flight is an wonderful  movie! Denzil Washington portrays a very flawed hero. Redemption is always a choice.  Don Cheadle and all of the cast were excellent in this movie.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Great movie showing inner workings of an arcade video game  Grandkids absolutely LOVED it even with seeing TRON 2.  Good to see original prior to second movie.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I didn't have high or low expectations going into the third MIB installment. I liked the first one and thought the second one was forced. I was pleasantly surprised how well-balanced and mature MIB III was, but fun enough to make my 11 year-old son say (\\"this was my favorite one!\\").<br /><br />I don't think anyone ever considered Men in Black to be a trilogy, but the way they scripted this third episode, it definitely could be considered one (although you can skip MIB II and not miss a beat).<br /><br />The acting is excellent. Will Smith continues to entertain, Tommy Lee Jones continues to \\"stone-face\\" his way into a personality, and Josh Brolin is a perfect TLJ in his younger days.<br /><br />If you want to enjoy the fun and action of the first MIB, with great character development and acting, you won't be disappointed in this third chapter.
B00008OE4W|5.0|Great movie!  My boys loved it growing up, so I wanted my two grandsons to see it.  Can't go wrong with Redford.
B000I9U8VO|3.0|Just think of an ability and you have a potential mutant. Add the racism analogy and you have cool super-heroes with a message AND a cause to fight for. X2 brings all of this together in a story so packed with action, in a script so easy to follow, it is a really enjoyable flick. Unfortunately, at over two hours, it gets a bit tedious as you squirm in your seat for the climax. And each of the movies seems to need a scene where the parents are unrealistically distant and horrified by their \\"mutant\\" kid. How many parents have kids with disabilities, but love and care for them regardless of their condition? If that \\"disability\\" is a super-power, wouldn't that make them love that kid even more? If you are watching X2 again, or even for the first time (after seeing X-Men: First Class), you'll find the Magneto scenes even more enjoyable
