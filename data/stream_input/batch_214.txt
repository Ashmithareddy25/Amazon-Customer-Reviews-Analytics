B00003CWOL|5.0|I'm mostly commenting on the fact that many reviewers call this movie a satire.  There's nothing satirical about it, it's one of the most entertaining, approachable movies about religion.<br /><br />First off, why isn't it satire?  It's religion + humor, right?  Yes, but the humor isn't designed to ridicule Christianity or faith in general, but to discuss it.  I really didn't find an ounce of cynicism in this flick, and to be honest, my faith was somewhat renewed thanks to this movie's fresh perspective on religion.<br /><br />Some compare this movie to \\"Life of Brian.\\"  Wow.  Some people are posting from the left side of Pluto.  Brian reaks with cynicism and dark humor, while, on the other hand, Dogma earnestly presents a world in which God and Satan and their assorted minions are very much a part of our life.  This leads to some outstanding scenes, especially the one in which the Angel of Death, back from a long absence, renews his career by liquidating the corporate board of a Disney...<br /><br />Classic line from that scene: \\"He was your son, you sick...\\"<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is great because it really discusses God and religion as something unremovable from life, even our modern, cynical lifestyle.  To all its detractors, most of whom have never, and will never, see it, this movie probably did more for the Faith than a million episodes of \\"The 700 Club.\\"<br /><br />And you have to admit, the Angel of Death looks good with a Desert Eagle .45.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
0571202284|5.0|This is a large volume, with a tremendous amount of helpful material for the character animator that would like to work in the classic movement style. Animators working with any medium will benefit from this book if they want to produce that classic motion feeling.
B00005U18E|2.0|You know a movie's in trouble when Salman Rushdie can steal the limelight from Zellweger and Grant.  We watch things happen to Zellweger seemingly at random - there's no apparent motive for the male characters.  I've been told that this is the entire point of the film, but if you're going to draw 2 dimensional characters as an artistic choice, it shouldn't look like an accident.  <BR>Maybe the studio wrote a $300 check to everybody else, but it offends me that DVD's are wasted on this vapid fluff while Drowning by Numbers is barely available on VHS.
0800177363|5.0|One of my favorite films.It is sensitive without getting maudlin.And most of all it showcases Robin Williams without his stereotypical funny man image and also De Niro without his \\"You talkin' to me \\" type machismo. Its a movie about the triumph of the human spirit told with a conviction that radiates from every frame.In short, very very watchable and that too many times.
B00004XQ83|5.0|No \\"murder down on music row\\" has been commited with this CD. From what I understand today's youth has been swallowing up this CD like candy. Hey Nashville get a clue not everyone wants cheesy pop music guised as \\"country music\\". This is one of the few contry Cds I purchased that was produced after Country Music TV came around. Take that Ms. Twain and all your \\"country\\" pals.
630512762X|5.0|Pigeons flying as bullets scream forward,choirgirls getting pinched on the bottom, Cage cavorting in a trenchcoat, Travolta showing how to stab someone, the sheer incredible plot line which assumes that if you change a face everyone in the world will look the same , and then again pigeons flying about make this one helluva rollercoaster ride. John Woo made a hash of Mission Impossible II but here he is just too much....a Hong Kong film made Hollywood style.And what I liked most about the film was that the message of forgiveness and starting anew which is given at the end of the film..it manages to lift a cool slugfest to something quite special..

B00005B36H|5.0|lateralus is a major breakthrough, the effect it will have on rock music, and just music in general in the years to come excites me. i do not think people understand that fact. while i do enjoy the songs on aenima slightly more as as a whole, i take nothing away from lateralus. the musicianship is at a much higher level and is truly the most original sounding album ive heard. as well, the emotional level is at times unbelievable, songs such as \\"the grudge\\" and \\"lateralus\\" are evidence of that. maynard james keenan is the best rock vocalist and one of the top singers of all time, hands down. behind micheal jackson and who else, im not sure. if you want to check out another great prog rock band look for \\"blackwater park\\" and \\"still life\\" by \\"opeth\\" 2nd best band in the world.
0312853238|5.0|Ender's Game is the reason I was drawn into sci-fi. The coming of age of a military genius in a fight for Earth's survival is simply fantastic. Orson Scott Card is great at character development and is able to actually make the reader like the characters he writes about. Also, the battle sequences inside the school were easy to follow and very exciting. This book is what I compare all sci-fi against and not many can hold a candle to this book.
B00005QIPH|4.0|What?  Some of these reviews are a little harsh.   I must say I listen to Jazz 80% of the time.  Very rarely do I hear anything from the pop scene that catches my ear, but this CD is fun, sure its not &quot;artsy&quot;, and it definitely isn't breaking any new ground in the world of music,  and sure they aren't supper talented musicians...but these songs come from these men, and they worked hard to get to where they are now and you can hear all of the late nights, the dead end jobs, and singing the same old lines over and over again wondering if anyone out there is listening...You can hear that in every song.  There is a raw energy in this record,  and I in fact like the mind numbing simplicity of it all.  These songs make me want to put the top down, let the wind mess up my hair, and drive to where ever with a back-seat full of friends!  This CD sounds like summer vacation to me.
B000021YQV|5.0|TOXICITY by System of a Down certainly reigned supreme in the year 2001. While another great band nipped closely at their heels(Tool), System of a Down certainly makes the band of the year on my list. Their music truly infilitrates a bit of your soul and keeps doing so until you reach enlightenment in a surreal sense. The music on this album contributes to giving you a proverbial high all without the need of toxic(pun intended) substances. So, for now, let's make a quick rundown of this supreme album's tracks:1. Prison Song- 2/10- When I first put this album in after hearing 'Chop Suey!' on the radio and already a fan after P.L.U.C.K. and Suite Pee from their self-titled debut, I was extremely disppointed. The convential means to an end which makes System of a Down a band in themselves was gone and now we were left with a proverbial shell. The lyrics were quite rash and forward, and the beat lacked that trademakr System of a Down feel. Extremely disappointing.2. Needles- 9/10- What an excellent song! Has all the trimmings of typical System of a Down faire and truly sets the stage for what the remainder of the album will be like.3. Deer Dance- 8/10- Quite powerful lyrics, but lacking a tad in the enuff section musically, this song also displays Serj's immense musical talents.4. Jet Pilot- 9/10- Better then Tracks 1 and 3, but not as good as 2, Jet Pilot houses within it all the great thrash metal trademarks that all System of a Down fans truly appreciate.5. X- 10/10- Terrific example of thrash metal that truly rings in the entire System of a Down genre. Don't be surprised if this song isn't played over the radio waves in the next few months.6. Chop Suey!- 10/10- No reason rating it. You've all heard it and we all love it. The BEST single of the year 2001, followed by Tool's Schism offering from earlier in the year.7. Bounce- 9/10- Gets docked a point because of the lack of seriousness which is evident in all SOAD songs, but still remains on the top because of its extreme talent and range that it exhibits.8. Forest- 7/10- A good song, but definately not a stand-out among the album. This song would be a knockout! in a band who lacks the talent of SOAD, but in this album, it just oesn't shine.9. ATWA- 100/10- No, that isn't a typo. This song, excuse my American dialect, kicks so much...! The lyrics and delivery are truly what makes this song the best song of the year 2001. If it becomes a single, it will probably take SOAD to a whole new level.10. Science- 7/10- Refer to Forest. Good song, but again, it lacks in many places, mainly in the power that is usually evident in Serj's voice.11. Shimmy- 7/10- Same as Tracks 8 and 10, Shimmy lacks the necessary seriousness, harshness, and power of SOAD.12. Toxicity- 10/10- After two decent tracks, this song punches you right in the face and screams into your ears. The power of Serj's vocals, and the talent of Daron's guitar are what make the title track the current best single of the year 2002, as a matter of a fact, one of a handful of actually decent tracks this year.13. Psycho- 10/10- After you are blown away by Toxicity, Psycho keeps you away with this huge offering. The lyrics are what truly make this anti-drug anthem a hit in my book. Another song that deserves to become a single just for the exemplary offering of Daron in the final moment's solo.14. Aerials- 10/10- The last track seals the stamp of my approval on this album. The song truly is set forth with the extremely powerful... well, everything. The only thing that might lack in this song is the power behind the drums but is more then made up for in the rest of the album. Another song that must be a single. NOTE: This song is followed up by an extremely awesome hidden track that will receive a 9/10 from my records.As a whole, you MUST buy this album. I just bought it after my debate trip to Berkeley this weekend, and I must have already listened to the entire thing(with an exception to the first track) about 5 times. THE BEST ALBUM OF 2001!
0345440757|4.0|My baby is now 7 month old, and we are what one can call victims of reading too many baby books and contradicting advices. In the last few months we had many problems of sleep and crying during bedtime (the baby got used to fall asleep on my breast and in our bed), and also we took the habit of lifting the baby every time he makes a sound. The baby wanted us to hold him all the time. I really felt totally exhausted. The book helped us in constructing a routine, which helped the baby and us. He sleeps more now, and in his own bed, ready to play more by himself, and I have more time to myself. Thanks to Tracy and the book.
B00004U8JU|5.0|Intense, supersonic-paced science fiction adventure finds paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and company invited to a remote tropical island theme park inhabited by genetically engineered dinosaurs! The awe and wonder is abruptly replaced by terror and a fight for survival after the park's security system is sabotaged, granting the resurrected behemoths free run of the island!<br />Director Spielberg is at his creative best in this tour de force of suspense, acutely blending action, thrills, awe and humor. Equal to the challenge is composer John Williams with an appropriately rousing and kinetic score that sounds something like Stravinsky on melodic steroids!<br />Expert direction, superb performances (Richard Attenborough is particularly effective as the eccentric billionaire entrepreneur, John Hammond) and breathtaking, unprecedented visual effects (the ILM computer generated dinosaurs are completely convincing!) more than compensate for less than dimensional characters and rudimentary plot. Along with the action and fun, \\"Jurassic Park\\" also raises some serious questions about the ethics of advanced science and cloning.<br />Perhaps Steven Spielberg's best adventure film, \\"Jurassic Park\\" truly is a cinematic masterpiece and one of my five favorite films of all time!
0451191153|2.0|I first read this book in high school. That is the perfect time to read it  and fully appreciate it, when you are young and impressionable and looking for something strong to cling to. The force of Ayn Rand's thinly veiled philosophy and one dimensional characters are attractive for their idealism.  I thought at the time it was one of the best books I'd ever read.<br />In college I went to a couple of lectures sponsored by some Ayn Rand influenced group and found their politics appalling. When it came to their lack of concern for people and their entirely un-nuanced capitalism  and libertarian agenda I realized the implications of her ideas. Upon re-reading the book I was embarrased by how much I had formerly  liked it. The characters were simply personifications of capitalism and socialism. The \\"love\\" was hero worship and the sex, rape. I found myself marveling at how black and white Ayn Rand's worldview is and how little it deals with the nuances of the real world. And how little I'd like to live in her world.<br />Read it when you're young, enjoy it, then look at it again later and see how far you've come. If you are interested in what she has to say, dig deeper. Read Nietzche, read Sartre, read Heidegger. Her  \\"philosophy\\" is a watered down version of some of the best existentialist minds and much worse for the simplification.
B00005UEAR|4.0|This is not the album I was expecting, after reading Mike Portnoy's comments that there were to be some experimental tracks I couldn't wait to get my hands on the disc or discs as it turns out.  Well I guess those tracks must have been left off the album because I don't hear anything even remotely experimental on either of these two discs.  I do hear some good music, some excellent music even and I hear music that doesn't really sound like DREAM THEATER at all, but experimental?.  No.<br />THE GLASS PRISON brings to mind early nineties thrash, mixed with PANTERA style grooves and LIQUID TENSION EXPERIMENT style prog rock, I wish Jordan Rudess would stop playing those guitar style keyboard solos, it sounds like one of those kid's toy guitars with the buttons along the neck.  When the music is thrashing along at the rate it does in some sections of this track you expect it to move into a blistering guitar solo(often it does), but other times you get a dodgey \\"fake\\" guitar solo.  There is no really great vocal hook on the entire track, some parts are OK, there are about three sections that you could call choruses, but none are that great, the \\"Welcome to my Glass Prison\\" part is extremely poor.  In the main though THE GLASS PRISON is an excellent track, it's the heaviest thing DREAM THEATER has ever recorded, it's constantly shifting pace and the thirteen minutes passes by very quickly.  Maybe James Labrie's voice sounds a bit light compared to the music, but I like it.<br />BLIND FAITH starts out sounding like it could have come off FALLING INTO INFINITY, but then moves into a thick though not quite heavy enough groove for it's rather average chorus, but then after a little while goes into one of the best instrumental sections on the whole album, an odd rythum that keeps evolving before eventually basically going back to the start of the song again.  A good track.<br />MISUNDERSTOOD once again starts out slowly then builds to a good chorus that sounds strangely familiar, I feel like I've heard it before, but I can't think where.  To be honest this track is just a normal rock song that you could hear on the radio stretched out to almost ten minutes by some admittedly sinister slow and heavy sections.  If cut down, this could easily be a single.<br />THE GREAT DEBATE seems to causing some debate and rightly so.  The intro section with the news reports etc. should have been scrapped.  This sort of thing has been done a million times before and in my opinion it never works.  It just makes the song a chore to listen to.  Then they have to go and use it on the fade out again.  Bastards.  The name TOOL seems to be popping up a lot, but I actually thought of FATES WARNING when I heard this track, but then again I don't like TOOL and don't listen to them.  Without he intro it's a solid track, but nothing to really get excited about.<br />DISAPPEAR is, from a pure song writing perspective anyway, the best track on disc one.  Not an amazing track, but it is well written and is good closer to the first disc.  Wouldn't sound out of place on AYREON's THE DREAM SEQUENCER.<br />Some more on disc one.  Does every single song need to start out slowly before it gets heavy? it's highly derivative and boring.  The whole disc sounds derivative actually, although each song sounds different they are each in their own way derivative.  Hey, I just used derivative three times in two sentence, I think that says two things, 1. I have a limited vocabulary and 2. I think you know.  I also would not like to see the LIQUID TENSION EXPERIMENT sound start to take over the DREAM THEATER sound as it is cerainly becoming ever more present,  the reason I like DREAM THEATER is because the sound like DREAM THEATER not LTE(didn't want to type it out again)<br />I still listen to disc one quite a bit though and it shouldn't be dismissed.<br />Disc two is really nothing new either, but the difference is that the songs are brilliant, this is one of DREAM THEATER's best releases and although I could have done without OVERTURE the rest is just about perfect.  If you liked SCENES FROM A MEMORY then you should like this as it's the next logical step.  SOLITARY SHELL is possibly the catchiest song they've ever written and THE TEST THAT STUMPED THEM ALL thrashes along and sounds like MEGADETH should sound these days.  Just about everything else on the disc is brillint too.<br />A classic though short DREAM THEATER album on disc two, and a solid album on disc one.  Still sounds like a good deal to me.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Everywhere on the internet or in stores this album was marketed as a hip-hop album; however it isn't. I could only imagine some hip-hop headz surprise when he discovered that it was an original rock n roll album! Fans of Del and misled hip-hop fans everywhere emphatically cast the gorillaz album in the flames feeling severaly dissappointed. I feel like this is such a shame because this album is AMAZING. It has been the most original rock n roll release that I have heard in a while. This album incorporates elements of hip-hop such as turntablist stuff and fat thudding beats but has an upbeat rock feel with melodic guitar and blur vocals. It comes out to be a really good mix with some very tuneful vocal hooks. It has instrumental arrangements typical of the automator, which are transformed to compliment the Albarn rock influence. Basically if you like a little hip-hop but you are more into blur (more recent stuff), badly drawn boy, brit rock, indie rock, even built to spill this album is for you. Me personally, I am a huge hip-hop fan but Most of my friends who are hip-hop heads think this album is wack. So if you have mild interest in this album and like both hip-hop and rock have no doubts GET THIS ALBUM! You wont regret it... peace.

B00005UQ9F|5.0|well ive been in the hospital the movie was shot at. and that is the most scariest, creepiest, most horrible place ive ever been in.( of course i snuck in ). if you were thinking if was a patient...lol. but yes that place is defiently haunted by all the souls that died in there, and i know from experience. I didnt last 3 hours in there and i was planning on spending the night exploring. and session 9 is a great movie. i saw it in the thearter in august, in cambridge MA. i think it was one of the best movies ive ever seen. but thats my opinon. cause ive been in there, and just seeing the movie is almost like.....being in there with permission, and not getting arrested. but yes if you like haunted places then you should defiently buy this movie.<BR>                                         CHRIS
B00005QZ7U|5.0|i think i understand why so many people hate this movie, there is not much dancing and it seems to be edited in only in fast-motion and slow motion. The fractured songs which aren't originals for the movie also irritates many purists. I would argue that its the evolution of the songbook musicals. The plot and character development may be razor thin and it is the same story Baz has told us twice before but all in all it is a musical. Musicals never have deep characters or interesting plots. Good musicals have entertaining numbers you can hum along too. I think this musical accomplishes what a good musical should, entertain. And it does this in an interesting and new way.
B00005UEAR|3.0|Overall a good album, but really &quot;too little&quot; after their remarkable &quot;Scenes of a memory&quot; work.  Fans will buy it anyway but for the new listener the fore-mentioned work is recommended. Dream Theater come across  technically perfect (as always), but lacking the creativity, complexion and inspiration that they've displayed in the past.
B000002B35|2.0|It is so disappointing that a magnificent group of musicians like Pink Floyd could release an album of this low caliber, it's almost enough to make one cry. After the success of their 1994 studio accomplishment \\"The Division Bell,\\" a trademark flashy arena tour was guaranteed, but unfortunately the band stopped any chances of having a continuation in quality by releasing the uninspired, obligatory live double album \\"Pulse.\\"<br />Though fans flocked to buy it upon release, sending \\"Pulse\\" to the top of the charts, this live album is nothing special and is entirely overrated. At least TEN of the tracks here were included on 1988's live album (also a double-disc set) \\"Delicate Sound Of Thunder;\\" there's the usual performances of 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond,' 'Another Brick In the Wall (Part 2),' 'Run Like Hell,' 'Wish You Were Here,' 'Comfortably Numb,' among countless others. But what's this? Disc two comes with Pink Floyd's first live performance of \\"Dark Side Of the Moon\\" in twenty years! This should be great, right? Wrong. The music becomes unlistenable due to the hooting and hollering of the clueless fans in the audience, and the rendition is tissue-thin ('Money' is ruined by the abundance of backup singers).<br />Had \\"Pulse\\" not come right after \\"The Division Bell,\\" Pink Floyd might have been able to continue their streak of quality. But now, years later, it's apparent two things will stop that--self-proclaimed \\"leader\\" David Gilmour's laziness and egotism, and this uninspired live album which had no place being released.
B000001DV2|5.0|The place where Hysteria left the band before this album was very hard to climb, any other songs could be mediocre than adrenalize ones, LETS GET ROCKED, WHITELIGHTING, MAKE LOVE LIKE A MAN; are real hits that makes keep the faith in def leppard, its very hard to reach the top, but its harder to support this place in the music.
B00005JKES|5.0|This set is great! The video and sound quality are excellent which is a welcome change after owning the VHS boxed set for so many years. The bonus materials include recent interviews with many of the cast members, a phone interview by Wrapped in Plastic with Mark Frost, notes on the deleted scenes, director's commentary tracks, the Log Lady Intros, the \\"Previously on Twin Peaks...\\" lead ins, and a section on the last DVD called \\"Tibet\\" with information about the characters and cast members with even MORE interviews. Sure the Pilot Episode is missing, but it's missing from all of the VHS boxed sets too...it's a licensing issue. With the amount of work put into this I'm sure Artisan did everything they could to include that too. I can't wait until the second season is available.
B000021YQV|4.0|I've never heard any music from SOAD before \\"Chop Suey!\\" and when I first heard it I shunned the band. I don't know how I lived without the cd. I took a risk, bought it and found that it kicks...! I love it. ALL OF YOU NEED TO GO OUT THERE AND BUY THIS CD!
B00005YTFG|5.0|This movie is just about my favorite. It was so differnt and emotional with the singing and the ideas. Using the random songs were fun. I was lauging when the buttlers were singing \\"Like A Virgin.\\"  I have the soundtrack now and listen to it at least once a day probably, it is that good!<br />It was strange when I watched it with different people. Either peiople love it, or think it is stupid, so i guess it depends on the mind of the viewer. The people that didn't like it aren't as romantic minded, they were'nt able to take in the extreams of the movie. Most people don't even watch musicals anymore so it was a strange twist. But I loved it!!
0671027344|2.0|Enjoying a wide variety of literature, with the \\"classics\\" being one of them, I was recommended this book. I was skeptical at first, obviously, since sappy and unconvincing coming-of-age books make me disrespect the writer even more. After reading this humourous little novel, I gained slight appreciation for it. Although it is nowhere near the realms of great stories of true growing men and their truths (as Catcher in the Rye or Great Expectations), it does however give you a sense of this boy's life. The problem with coming-of-age books is that the reader can so easily relate or not relate with the book's reality. Therefore, an exceptionally good book of this genre requires the reader to be convinced. So, does the reader fall into the writer's convictions of struggle in the heart of a growing teen? More or less. Is it poor on writing things that the average adult might have washed away once leaving that rediculous ignorance of adolescence. Often.<br />The Perks of being a Wallfower is the kind of book that either touches or fails you in your attempts of a good read. If you're an insecure teenager or one that enjoys the confusement of adolescent truth, than this is probably to your liking. If you are an experianced reader who enjoys truth, without it being overly done and trying, this may not be your type of thing. Either way, it depends on the reader and is probably worth reading anyway (like all books).<br />Ahhh, it makes you remember you're teenage years. Were they \\"infinite\\" like the book states? Well, I suppose to each is own. As for me, although my experiances were very different and more secure on self-truth, I can still close my eyes and smell the sweet taste of nostalgia.
B00004T9UF|5.0|A lot of anger in here...probably the softest spot is the classic \\"Stan\\", a story about a suicidal Slim Shady fan.  So that's the mood.   Lyrically, this is probably Eminem's best album as yet, the only problems being some weak beats and very samey subject matter.  The Slim Shady LP was pretty diverse really...this is all either-fame sucks, gay people suck, or fame sucks more than gay people.  That's not really much of an issue on dopeness liek Remember Me though.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I was very skeptical to buy this album. I have her other 2 cds and think that they are pretty good.  Ms. Spears definitly did some growing up on this album, and the songs are pretty good for the most part.  Britney gets dissed by everyone, for everything she does, wears, or says.  The thing is, Britney is pursuing her dreams, and she definitly deserves them.  This girl has worked very hard, and she is a teenager, what do you expect her to wear?  She can wear whatever she wants, its her choice.  Yes, her voice isn't that great all the time, but I love rocking out to her songs, they are just fun, and upbeat.  I give Britney all the credit in the world, you go GIRL!!!
B00005NB8J|1.0|This really ought to be a one word review. The heading should speak for itself. I gave Independence Day a \\"2 stars\\" rating so I could save room at the bottom for this pathetic excuse of a movie. The witless, tone-deaf script, coupled with bad turns from good and bad actors, make this movie difficult to sit through. I didn't leave the theater, but it was really tempting. The only people who might like this movie are the really young (those who are just learning a language), the really dumb, or those who don't think that good writing, good stories, and good acting count for much. I usually try to spare the feelings of those who disagree with me, but this pathetic messy $100 million effort is one of the cinematic crimes of the century.<br />I didn't like it.
0446608955|5.0|I think A Walk To Remember is the best book I have ever read in my entire life.  Eventhough I am only fourteen years old I can still tell a good book from a bad book.  At shcool I have to read a certain number of pages to get a grade in English class.  Before that time I thought reading was a punishmentor something just to take up time.  But now that I ahve read this book I don't think that at all.  I want to read more and more every day.  I hope Nicholas Sparks writes a sequel to A Walk To Remember so all the questioning will stop if jaime dies or not in the book.  If you have read the book I hope you feel the same way I do and if you haven't I hope you do because this book, is without a doubt, the best book in the WHOLE world!  I loved it and I hope you do too.
0767817478|2.0|one could think of a lot of better uses for the $100 million they dropped on this throway film.  I give it a 2 only because Matthew Broderick is in it.  I really should have given it a one.<br />After seeing Stargate, I thought these shmucks would've have been run out of town.  But no, give them even more money so they can make even more drech.  Spare yourselves the disappointment.  See something else.  Anything else.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I usually get caught up in fantasy-style children's fare but this one just didn't have me caring one bit.

1558908420|5.0|Ray Liotta steals the show over other great performances.  An All-Star cast of great actors.  It takes place in the 90's - see the ragging for betting against the Bulls, \\"We are the World\\", etc.  But, it has such a throwback look, you'd think it was the 70's.  These cops had grown into habits and routines that they don't like questioned.  The Jersey suburb is supposed to be more like the good old days in the neighborhood where everyone knew their neighbors.  Stallone is a regular guy who just wants to make friends and is content that way.  He realizes that he will never be a real NYPD cop and he will never get the girl, but he is content with that.  Eventually he learns too much about the corruption and has to make a stand against it.  <br />\\"We've built ourselves a nice community here.

They start with the facts and then intregrate them into principles. Reality actually means something to them, unlike most academic and even real-world marketers.
B00001OH7X|3.0|Bowie was never dull in the seventies.  Lodger isn't boring in terms of analysing Bowie's wonderful career, but it's sandwiched in between better albums.  As a piece of work, it continues Bowie and Eno's musical explorations. For that, those going through Bowie's back catalogue may find it interesting, yet unspectacular in parts.<br /><br />Bowie's musical aims at this point, unlike later with the success of Let's Dance, weren't about pleasing the fans. It was however, about doing something new.  Lodger has a lot of stuff that stands out in an odd way, or slips by you.  But it doesn't feel as cutting edge as its predecessors Heroes and Low did - this is a more assorted, almost disparate outing.<br /><br />While the album doesn't shine as a whole, there are nuggets in the rough.  \\"Look Back In Anger\\" which would become a Bowie live favourite - is as excellent as they come.  \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" sounds dated now, but is memorable for its music video, which should have come with the CD.  \\"DJ\\" is Bowie's histrionics.  A nod to campiness.  The other tracks feature Bowie's stabs at different vocal stylings and world beats.<br /><br />By today's standards, old Bowie fans would hunger for him to return to a form like this.  A better album to come would be the next one however - Scary Monsters and Super Creeps.  But one must give Bowie his dues for his constant experimentation - which has made him the legend he is.<br /><br />Collect this if you must.  But this one doesn't get much play amongst my Bowie collection.
B00003CXV4|3.0|Interesting, but slightly unbelievable story of a workaholic who takes up a crazy women's offer to stay with her for a month.  No workaholic would take that offer, but Keanu Reeves does.  I loved Charlize Theron's portrayal of this character, she is the only good thing about this film.  And be forwarned, this is not the fairy tale it seems to be.  The movie was shooting for the top and the typical fairy tale ending, but went the other way.  Too much to believe in, including the ending.  Watchable, but not that great.
6301735048|4.0|This movie is one of my favorites...one I don't mind seeing again and again.  It has mystery, suspense, love, etc. all wrapped into one movie.  The musical score is haunting and lovely and inspiring and touching.  I was so sad to not see info on a soundtrack in the film's credits, tried getting a soundtrack here, but was told one was not available.  Recently I purchased the video...and the video indicated the soundtrack IS available on Silva Screen Records in the UK.  Just received the CD ...  Had to have it shipped from the UK to USA, but it's worth it.  I know other reviewer mentioned wishing there was a soundtrack, so hope this is helpful to you.  Great movie!!!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|solidly crafted, comparatively thoughtful exploration of the problems of loss and memory disguised as a crime thriller--kind of like a lighter, less surrealistic version of \\"last year at marienbad.\\" <BR>the narrative backmasking, cinma vrit techniques and soft peddling of its melodramatic aspects didn't grab too much box office (or academy award nominations), but the film has managed to gain a wider audience based on it's artistic merits:  some subtler reflections on the nature of the detective as icon and genre, the contradictions of the filmatic urban avenger and some engaging acting performances--the enigmatic, chameleon-like guy pearce, a suitably sullen carrie-anne moss and a cheerfully perverse joe pantoliano.<BR>actually watching it provides the kind of jolting calm effect akin to last year's other under-rated, alienation-effect piece, \\"the man who wasn't there.\\"<BR>the movie doesn't go for cheap shocks or pat answers and hence, requires a modicum of intellectual engagement--quite a change from being beaten over the head with grand mal digital explosions and third-grade fart jokes.  \\"memento\\" is the kind of patient, emotionally mature film you don't see too much of anymore (at least at your local gigaplex).
0375507507|5.0|The Panama I grew up in the 1960's and '70's was a third world country.  It was nothing like &quot;Bobo's&quot; war-torn Africa.  However, when I heard Alexandra Fuller on the radio, talking about her book, I instantly related to the sense she conveyed of being a child of the first world, growing up in a third world that has now vanished.  I think of it as a time when the last vestiges of colonial life were disappering.<br />Anyway, I immediately ordered her book.  I was not disappointed.  In a very direct and personal way, Ms. Fuller conveys what it was like living in a developing country amidst expatriates and indigenous peoples.  The book immediately brought back the wonder and richness, and contrasts of a childhood in such a place.<br />Contrasts:  Much of what Ms. Fuller describes of the natural beauty of Africa reminds me of the Panamanian interior.  On the other hand, like Bobo, I had to learn to operate a battle rifle at an early age because there were people who wanted my father and family dead.<br />This wonderful book also reminded me of the costs of such a life to many people I knew growing up; costs paid in alcoholism, mental and illness and other great losses.<br />I finished the book knowing I would feel very much at home having more than a few beers with Bobo and her family.<br />Notwithstanding their trials, or perhaps because of them, Bobo and Van, like most of my friends, apparently grew up to be fine adults.<br />This book conveys some great truths about commitment, love, family, the wonder of childhood, ordeal and triumph.  I recommend it heartily.
B000021YQV|4.0|Wow, you know, I've really missed out on this band.  I always assumed they were just another \\"numetal\\" band that wasn't worth my time, so I never really listened to them much.  But, I decided to borrow this album and the debut from a friend, just to see what I thought of them.  I listened to the debut first, and it blew me away.  Aside from \\"Sugar\\", every song on it is just amazing.  So, I couldn't wait to hear what this one sounded like.  Well, it's mostly the same, though not near as good.  I like that they have put more melody into it, and as such made a slightly more varied album, but still, there is something missing.  For one thing, the music isn't quite as technical as on the debut.  There aren't near as many solos and wild rhythm changes, even though it still far exceeds that of the average numetal band.  Another thing is that there are too many weird short songs that don't really go anywhere or do anything.  There's at least four of them, and \\"Bounce\\" is the most unlistenable of them all (funny, but unlistenable).  Out of the \\"normal\\" songs (the ones that exceed 2 minutes), there's plenty to enjoy.  Faves would have to be \\"Science\\", \\"Deer Dance\\", \\"Aerials\\", and the title track.  \\"Chop Suey\\" is kind of like \\"Sugar\\", in that it's the most commercially successful song, and yet doesn't do much for me.  It's ok, but there are much better songs to be found here.<br />Aside from the fact that the level of technicality is slightly lower, the musicians are still in fine form.  Daron puts on an excellent performance on the guitar (though there need to be more leads), and John still pounds the skins admirably.  The basslines aren't as audible as on the debut, but then they aren't that impressive anyway.  Serj is just crazier than ever, still making use of his amazing range.  He also sings softly moreso than on the debut, which is good, because he's got a great singing voice.  At times, he almost reminds me of Ed Kowalczyck from Live.  The lyrics are even weirder than before, and that says a lot.  What do you have to be on to come up with something like \\"Jet Pilot\\"?<br />If you liked the debut, you'll probably like this too, but personally I don't think it's anywhere near as good.  They made some progressions, but it's just not as consistently brilliant.  I really wish people would stop calling this band \\"numetal\\".  Numetal is boring trash like Limp Bizkit and the Deftones.  That title does not do this band justice.before, and that says a lot.

B000005H4K|5.0|I love my collection of old 20s and 30s Ellington - like \\"The Okeh Ellington,\\" the two sets of \\"The Dukes Men,\\" and others.  Some of the later stuff is a little too \\"blue hair - big band\\" for this boomer, although some of it is also quite good.  But \\"Money Jungle\\" is a completely different Ellington experience.  I  love it.  It is get down, kick ass, small combo jazz, like the Coltrane Quartet, and many others from that early 60s period.  A collection of Ellington without it is incomplete.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Look at the concept behind Pink Floyds' 'Dark Side of the Moon' then look at the concept behind Pearl Jams' 'Binaural', very simular, go ahead &amp; just look at the album covers even - sure this album takes a while to get into, but once you do get into it, i can guarantee it will change your life, you just wont look at things the same way ever again - this album was obviously inspired by Neil Young &amp; Pink Floyd, but it still is Pearl Jams music, this album, sadly, may be the most under rated album of all time so far, but buy it, when youre driving in your car &amp; its dark outside at night, or going hiking, or when its cloudy outside, or when its raining...... just listen to Binaural on your headphones when theres that feeling in your stomach like everyone in the world has dissapeared &amp; youre the only person on earth, and your life will be changed, you may not understand now, but if you listen to it at those times, you'll get it.......concept &amp; all, you'll never be the same after bonding with this album, ever, you just need the right place &amp; time &amp; feeling to tap into it, when you do tap into it, you'll love it just as much, no matter where &amp; when you listen to it again - Pearl Jam proved once &amp; for all with this album, that they were not just another Seattle band dubbed with the trend word of 'grunge', nope, they proved theyre a rock band, so give this band &amp; album a chance - Binaural = one of the greatest albums of all time, by the greatest band to ever exist
B000002KBD|5.0|Van Morrison has made so many albums, many vastly different from the one preceding, that it would be hard for a new fan to know where to start. I have a recommendation: get Moondance then get His Band and Street Choir. Together these albums provide the listener with the essential expression of Van Morrison's love of American rhythm and blues.<BR>Most of us have heard Domino and Blue Money. Good as they are for top 40 tunes they are hardly the best songs on the CD. The insouciant swing of Give Me A Kiss and Call Me Up In Dreamland are in stark contrast to the morose introspection that imbues some of his later masterpieces. The hard-driving sax on I've Been Working makes it impossible not to want to dance. If I Ever Needed Someone gives voice to Morrison's deep spirituality and Street Choir seems a scolding antidote to the anti-Americanism that was rife at the time of recording.<BR>Put this CD on, and it will lift you right up no matter how down you are feeling. Out of all his albums, I rate this in the top 5. It is upbeat, it is rock, it is jazz, it is blues, and it is hippie soul at its best.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam is simply the greatest band of all time.  even though this album sold 10 million copies, its still under rated, buy it right now
B00005RYLE|5.0|The Book of the Dead Limited Edition is as much a work of art as the movie that comes attached. You get a latex-bound book, hand-painted and fashioned into the likeness of a human face. Inside, you find all the lovely \\"written in blood\\" pages that are displayed in the Trilogy of Movies. This is one high-quality Limited Edition, and a bargain if you're getting it at release. If you even remotely like horror, you MUST buy this movie. If you even remotely like Evil Dead... you really don't have a choice in the matter - you need this edition. Don't dally, though, because this one will be worth more than the legendary Army of Darkness Limited Edition.
B00005RDSM|5.0|The Special Edition Peter Pan includes the &quot;making of&quot; film as well as the original introduction by Walt Disney himself. Bringing the older classics to the digital arena is a great concept that allows you to view the pictures and sound as they were intended. I give this disc the highest rating of five stars for features, picture and sound. Better hurry, these Disney DVD's are only around for a short time, usually sixty days.
B00004YA66|5.0|&quot;Frequency&quot;, to me, is like two stories in one...the first story is set in 1969 and it describes Frank Sullivan (an outstanding Dennis Quaid), a working-class NY fireman living in Queens with a loving wife (Elizabeth Mitchell) and his son John. The second story is set in 1999, 30 years later. It describes John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel), all grown up and is a police officer, not a firefighter like his father. Basically, John could not get over the fact that Frank, his father, had died in a building fire. John's best friend Gordo (Noah Emmerich) comes across a ham radio inside John's house. The ham radio used to belong to Frank a long time ago, so Gordo urges John to give it a try. And soon enough, the radio works under the different frequencies of the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis. John could not believe it when he is talking to his father, who's been dead for 30 years. As the film goes on, there is a string of murders that are the work of a serial killer. And John in 1999 and Frank in 1969 must team up to prevent these killings from happening again from the results of 30 years ago. Gregory Hoblit (&quot;Primal Fear&quot;, &quot;Fallen&quot;) directed this film with perfection all the way! &quot;Frequency&quot; is so entertaining and so thrilling that it will have you asking the question: &quot;What if you could go back in time and change the event that altered your life forever?&quot; This is Dennis Quaid's best performance since &quot;The Big Easy&quot; and &quot;Flesh and Bone&quot;. And this is Jim Caviezel's breakout performance in which he did an excellent job. And the DVD version of &quot;Frequency&quot; just couldn't be better, with deleted scenes and more! &quot;Frequency&quot; is truly one of the best sci-fi drama-type films ever made.
B00005JKQX|3.0|3 1/2 STARS...<br />I honestly had no desire on seeing this film. Once I saw the trailer and heard Russell Crowe sporting that horrible accent I knew that I would be dissapointed with him as I was with 'Gladiator'. There was that flaw and the fact that Ron Howard who is NOT one of my favorite director (i.e. Far and Away, Apollo 13, Dr. Suess' How the Grinch whatever) However, I can now say that film is actually good. Ron Howard didn't [mess] it up that bad. Russell Crowe, I can now say, was totally magnificent! I felt for him so much. I mean I actually cared for the poor [man]. Now, I really want him to win that Oscar. I probably sound stupid but he really should. ... Russell can give his Oscar to Rush and keep this year's statue. I was also surprised with Jennifer Connely. I loved her in 'Requiem' and I was kind of surprised that she even took the role seeing that she was being the indi queen for the moment. She will also win for best supporting actress. ...<br /> Still, RON HOWARD should NOT win best director. How can one direct a biographical piece if one takes out the most personal stuff? Howard neglected the fact that John Nash was bisexual. Eventhough he put it in their very cleaverly but totally unclearly, I think that it would have made the film a whole lot interesting. Just thinking that Howard had to ignore that fact just so he could make 'A Beautiful Mind' a mainstream PG-13 rated film is just sleazy. <br />I also thought the film was rather long than usual. I think this is because Mr. Howard abuses the title card effect to denote that the years gone by. It was totally annoying because I had to start all over again with liking the film. I mean I did a lot but I had to do it far more than once.<br />'A Beautiful Mind' could have been a great film. It is a good film. I like it. But Howard just [upset] me ... with his hiding behind the bush about Nash's sexuality.
B00005JKED|5.0|\\"Training Day\\" is among one of those films that you would have to watch very carefully to find out exactly what is going on throughout. And yet, it is so entertaining and so powerful that you would not believe Denzel Washington's performance in this movie until you have seen it! And speaking of his performance, you get to see a side of Denzel that you have never seen before...as the bad guy! That's right! Washington stars as veteran Detective Sargeant Alonzo Harris, a \\"lone wolf\\" cop that, to him, has spent too many years obeying the law, etc., that he goes over the edge (a.k.a. \\"crossing the line\\"). This film is also about a fresh-faced LAPD rookie named Jake Hoyt (an excellent Ethan Hawke), who is anxious to join the elite narcotics squad headed up by none other than Harris himself. So Harris has agreed to give Hoyt a shot at joining his team with a one-day ride-along during which Hoyt must prove his mettle if he wants to make it into narcotics. As the day wears on, however, it becomes increasingly clear to the greenhorn that Hoyt's experienced mentor has blurred the line between right and wrong to an alarming degree, enforcing his own morally compromised code of ethics and street justice. In conclusion, I would like to say that \\"Training Day\\" is nothing short of being intense. This is one of Denzel Washington's most frightening performances that I have seen on the big screen in a long time. And I would like to say this: \\"Denzel, please stick to the good guy roles. I know that this is a major change for you, but pleeeease stick to what you're really good at...and that's bringing out the good in you in any film that you make.\\" \\"Training Day\\" is a great DVD addition to any Denzel Washington collection!
B000002UA9|3.0|Overall, this is a fine debut. What set the Beatles apart from the other groups was both their original material, and their selections of generally obscure cover tunes. Obviously, the Beatles would get more creative as time went on, but in comparison with other albums from the period, this is as good as any. There really are only a couple of songs that seem a bit weak, or overly commercial, but the good most certainly outweighs the bad. Most early British Invasion albums of were built around a couple of hits, with predominant filler, but with the unparalleled song writing aptitude that Lennon and McCartney showcased throughout their career, even the filler is worth investigating. There are six songs on the album that play on oldies stations regularly, (although it is an earlier version of Love Me Do without Ringo drumming that was the hit), tracks 1,7,8,9,11, and 14. Despite the occasional manufactured commercial track, the album has rock credentials, as I Saw Her Standing There was quite an original rock and roll song. Please Please Me is recommended to anyone interested in the Beatles early period.
B000002MY3|5.0|This album is amazing, and the very first one by Alanis Morisette.  It's a must have for any fan; this album will not let you down and you'll want to listen to it again and again.
B000002UAF|4.0|This was a great improvement over the previous efforts, as Lennon and McCartney, whose song writing abilities continued to improve, wrote all thirteen tracks. The songs feature fine arrangements and chord selection, with excellent melodies. More than half the songs play regularly on oldies radio stations. Very likely, it would be trivial for a reviewer to go over the tracks because of how well known they are, but there are great rockers such as Can't Buy Me Love, and fine ballads in If I Fell. Something that is not usually mentioned is the album's overall impact on the folk rock movement epitomized by the Byrds, as George Harrison used a twelve-string guitar on many tracks. The lyrics were not yet sophisticated, but there are glimpses of rebellion in some of John Lennon's songs such as the rocking You Can't Do That. Absolutely no other album competed with this one in 1964, and A Hard Day's Night goes down as strongly recommended.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I read the reviews before watching the DVD and I was well prepared about the strong and weak points many reviewers have written. After watching the DVD, I must say that I am still unsatisfied with the performance by the leading actress Amanda Root. As many reviewers have said before, she's totally unattractive no matter it's in the beginning or in the end where some reviewers have said that she has \\"blossomed\\" or \\"transformed\\". Beside her apparance, her acting skill was not impressive, either. She just had her eyes wide open at almost every shot. As to Capt. Wentworth played by Ciaran Hinds, I have to say that he's totally charming and handsome. He steals the show. Whenever he appeared in any scene he's the focus. No question asked. I love watching Jane Austin's movies very much. I have BBC's Pride and Prejudice, BBC's Emma, Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility and I just need to add the Persuasion to my collection. The story itself was extremely romantic. The casting and the set are wonderful, too. However, I just can't help but wandering if Anne Elliot was portrayed by a slightly younger, more eye-pleasing actress, then this movie might have been my favorite Jane Austin movie of all time. Hope there will be another adaptation (maybe on the big screen) in the future.
B000002UAC|3.0|This can be seen as a continuation of the previous album. Once again, there are eight originals (including seven by the prodigiously talented song writing team of Lennon/McCartney), and six covers. The originals showed the same excellence as the ones on the previous record. Harrison also wrote his first song in the minor key rocker Don't Bother Me. What may have made With The Beatles slightly weaker than it's predecessor is some of the covers. Till There Was You and Devil In Her Heart were fine softer folk styled arrangements, and Lennon screams Money out quite well, but Postman, Beethoven, and You Really Got a Hold On Me are really not earth-shattering, though they are sung well. Despite the three or so average tracks, the album is a good listen. George Harrison established himself as a fine guitarist with many unique counter melody solos, and the band also came more into their own as singers. The album probably is not essential, but it is a fine continuation of the debut, and recommended to those who are interested in the Beatles early period.

Using instrumental music is clearly a way to share the beauty with the soul. <br />Loreena's angelic voice comes up from her heart as she sings of those passing on in Dante's Prayer, &quot;please remember me.&quot; The Highwayman is a ballad of long ago, but only Loreena's soulful voice could bring it to the light of day in such a way as to give one chills everytime it is heard. We couldn't forget Mummers Dance as a story of days gone by, the wonderful lyrics and beautiful sounds is what most of us credit to finding this one of a kind artistic icon. <br />With each new creation she leaves us wanting more. With a wide mix of love found or lost, of legends and lore, or her instrumental sounds, The Book of Secrets is purely a legend in it's own time.

B00005QK3W|2.0|I have really not thought much of Paul McCartney's music since his early years as a solo artist and with Wings.  I read the reviews, and thought, maybe I should give him another chance.  After listening to the album, my original opinion was reinforced.  The songs are not well-thought out, they are mostly \\"silly love songs\\" and seem like they were simply cranked out to fill space.  There are maybe two melodies that are worthwile, but the lyrics aren't as introspective or thoughtful as one would hope from a musician of his experience and age.  I'm sorry I can't recommend it.

1559408898|2.0|First, I want to say that I really,REALLY have liked this movie for sometime now. If this were the only version available, I probably would have given it 3-1/2 stars. But when you pay over 30 bucks for a DVD, you expect lots of bells and whistels and shiny things. But today I just happened to check out the back of the regular DVD in a Dept. store. The Criterion version only has audio in 2 channel stereo. If that's what the film was originally recorded in, fine. But, it has since been remixed (as have many titles for DVD) in English 5.1, which is available on the Dept. store release for half the price. But thqt's not allllll you get!! Also for half the price, you get French AND Spanish, both in 5.1 surround. For thjose who speak neither language-or who don't have a surround sound system-it's probably no big deal. The thing that originally attracted me to DVD's was the separate language tracks. It takes away from text-book boredom, and you get to hear how the languages are truly spoken. Even if the detp-store version only had English, I would still be miffed by the fact that it's in 5.1,whilst the Criterion version only has stereo (those who are finicky about sound will understand). While the picture quality is superb..and okay..the audio isn't THAT bad..the \\"extras\\" really aren't that good.Maybe for film students and really hardcore fans. It was neat to see the \\"deleted scenes\\" via the story board, but on the whole, this particualr DVD is wayyyyy overpriced for what you get. I thougt \\"The Rock\\" from the Criterion Collection was great, so I was expecting the same of this.I learned the hard way to research,research,research before purchase!And despite the claim of additional footage, it's exactly the way I remember it,(and I've seen it al least 2-4 times a year before I got the DVD).Maybe I missed somthing (or we've all become desensitized to squibs and gunfire in the years since it's initial release).
B000002A3T|5.0|While &quot;Animals&quot;, &quot;The Wall&quot;, and &quot;The Final Cut&quot; were wonderful cds, they were mostly Roger Waters, with the rest of the band having little say on anything.  After Roger left, &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; was released, although this time, Dave Gilmour is the dominating force.  With &quot;The Division Bell&quot;, the remaining three members are working in a way they haven't been working since &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.  They are working TOGETHER, and as a result, they have recorded Pink Floyd's best cd since WYWH.<br />Although there are no songs that go into the double digits, restrain isn't always a bad thing.  All 11 songs on &quot;The Division Bell&quot; are consistently good, making good use of acoustic guitars, a variety of pianos and keyboards, and the trademark Gilmour solo.  Like evry other Floyd cd, the flow from song to song is a smooth transition, making this 60+ minute CD interesting, without dragging on.<br />The first half of the cd is fairly mellow, with a pair of relaxing instrumentals (&quot;Cluster One&quot;, &quot;Marooned&quot;), the soaring ballads (&quot;Poles Apart&quot;, &quot;A Great Day For Freedom&quot;), the bluesy &quot;What Do You Want From Me?&quot;, and the Richard Wright-penned &quot;Wearing the Inside Out&quot;.<br />The second half of the cd have a slew of radio singles, including the upbeat &quot;Keep Talking&quot;, the U2-esque (&quot;Take It Back&quot;, &quot;Coming Back To Life, &quot;Lost For Words&quot;), and the dramatic finale, &quot;High Hopes&quot;.  <br />In conclusion, &quot;The Division Bell&quot; is a great way for Pink Floyd to say goodbye.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|The people that praise this film are kidding, right? Either that or I want what they are on to see how great this movie is to them. I mean, what's the deal here? 2 hours of not only predictable but MTV video like, jumbled up sequences. Not one song original! Okay, okay, maybe one or two, but is THAT what a true musical is suppose to be? Ewan and Nicole's talent it wasted. Not one scene is not surreal. That may be good sometimes but althroughout the movie it makes you sick! I cannot stress how much I hated this. And that Ziddler was also making my friend sick--his face was too creepy, never gets out of your mind. Go see a musical worthwhile, like Cabaret or The Sound of Music. Hell, even Mary Poppins is better.

0553565915|1.0|Betty Eadie's book has captured the imaginations of the world with her story of her near death experience.  Perhaps it's a wise idea to remember that's exactly what it is: a STORY, which (as it has done for many a story-teller) has made her rich.<br />Experiences such as dreams of the afterlife and near death experiences are sacred and should be treated as such.  Telling everyone who will listen and setting herself up as a prophetess is a bit much.  Perhaps her first thoughts after her experience would have been wiser: she had a near-death experience and it renewed her faith in God and reminded her that she needs to love others.  End of story.<br />Every \\"psychic\\" and \\"medium\\" and \\"palm reader\\" out there knows exactly what she is doing.

B00005QZWI|5.0|This soundtrack is incredible! When I saw the movie for the first time, the part where the Fellowship is climbing over the mountain after they had just departed Rivendell, and the music is climbing towards the climax, that's when I knew I would buy this soundtrack. It has a very peaceful and happy theme at the beginning (Concerning Hobbits) that turns to an intense and choral theme (A Knife in the Dark) and becomes very heroic and powerful as the music demonstrates good vs. evil in The Bridge of Kazad-Dum! I LOVE the brass (as I am a hornist myself) Words cannot describe the power of music!
B000046PVN|5.0|It's Superific!<BR>    John Williams wrote one of his best scores in this masterpiece. While I can't comment on the new tracks included here. I know this soundtrack has to be worth the price since it includes 15 more tracks. That's double the music. Plus it includes alternate tracks. WOW!!! The music is got to be worth every penny. I love the music to Superman. Especially the Main March. John Williams did a great job on it. And of course, March of the Villians. One of the best soundtracks of all time.
B00005YTFG|1.0|An overrated piece of garbage!  This movie is loud and obnoxious!  It's all over the place and confusing.  It reminds me of the Alice and Wonderland ride at Disneyland.  The only differance is the ride is fun and the movie is boring and annoying.  I can't belive this movie is nominated for best picture, how stupid.
B000000WFZ|5.0|That track says it all about this soundtrack. And the first cue is the main reason to buy the soundtrack. It's a beautiful theme that has a great choir, Indian instruments, and some great violin playing. It's just awesome.<BR>  Then there's the track &quot;Falls&quot; which is very pretty. It is just awesome. &quot;Gabriel's Oboe&quot; is another great track, and is a very pretty oboe piece. &quot;Ave Maria Guarani&quot; is a beautiful choir cue that is just beautiful. It's brings old church songs to your mind. &quot;Brothers&quot; is a good cue has guitar and flute playing very nicely. &quot;Vita Nostra&quot; in the movie is the first appearance of a wonderful motif that I can't really label. But's it's pretty and is built upon later in &quot;The River&quot; and in &quot;On Earth as it is in Heaven&quot; It's great! &quot;The Mission&quot; is a nice cue that sees the Falls theme continued in better detail. &quot;River&quot; is another outstanding edition of the motif experience before in &quot;Vita Nostra&quot; this one is a little better though. &quot;Te Deum Gurani&quot; is another piece like &quot;Ave Maria&quot; it's a little different. But it's very pretty. Then comes the battle scences that includes some great Indian instrumentation. of the highlights here are &quot;Ascunsion&quot;, &quot;Gurani&quot;, and &quot;The Sword&quot; which has &quot;Gabriel's Oboe&quot; in it with a twist. And &quot;Miserere&quot; is just plain sad. You have to listen to &quot;On Earth as It is in Heaven&quot; one more time, because in the movie it is actually is  after &quot;Miserere&quot; in the movie. <BR>A must have for any soundtrack lover!
1881273156|2.0|I have read the book 'The five love languages' and the ideas in it are quite interesting. But I have never read a book of someone who has such a high self-esteem. He always finds a way to mention his own name over and over. He doesn't really praise the ideas, he let the people he states praise him as miracle maker. I'm sure he has a high quota of failures as every other marriage counselor too. This book is a written sermon.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|When I saw &quot;Shrek&quot; in the theaters over the summer, I was amazed at the wonderful story, characters, music, and animation.  And the DVD only enhances the experience!  You get two discs for the price of one, and they're LOADED with extras.  Making-of featurettes, technical goofs, music videos, games, trivia, the list goes on.  The people at Dreamworks certainly know how to utilize DVD's to their fullest potenital!  My only complaint is that many of the most intersting features are accessed only through DVD-ROM, and since I don't have a DVD-ROM drive on my computer (as most people don't, I'm sure), I can only imagine what the other features are like.  I would love to play with the voice-over feature!  But alas, it was never meant to be.  But if you have a DVD-ROM drive on your computer, all the more better!  But if not, this is still a great DVD to have.
0385505833|4.0|Loved this diversion from legal thrillers.  Grisham proves to be an entertaining author giving us what is possibly his personal take on a holiday that's emphasis has moved from the Christ-child to the shopping mall.  GREAT little read -- especially during the holiday season when you just cannot take one more traffic jam or office party!!

B00004Z311|5.0|It's hard to believe that one director can give us so many wonderful and varied motion pictures - Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, Bladerunner... and the underappreciated Legend, which is easily one of the best fantasy films ever made. This film literally takes you to another place and time, and a more atmospheric, enchanting motion picture I have yet to see. <br />I've been waiting for this DVD release for quite some time now (like so many others), and this delay is seriously grating on my nerves. How long can it possibly take?! The fans WANT this movie, and we want it NOW! It's getting really old already...
B00003CXMG|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME! Its my favorite. I don't know how anyone connot like it. The casting was great. Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, Patrick Fugit, Zooey Deschanel and Philip Seymour Hoffman were made for their characters. Crowe brought inspiration throughout this movie. This is a must buy. Don't miss out. Great Job Crowe!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005UEAR|5.0|well... one thing that REALLY suprised me was all of the negative reviews at 2-3 stars... that is a real shocker for me. I haven't been a dream theater for 10 years like some people, only a few years, but i have listened to each disc maybe 40 times (with the exception of FII which i never bought.. but will one day) and i know personal preference yadda yadda but i don't understand how a fan could give this a 2... not because &quot;dream theater is invincible and never writes a bad song&quot; but because the songwriting on this disc may be their most mature yet. I still like SFAM best, but this album ranks a close second... as many have said the second disc is just awesome... there are no parts where the song drags on, the entire thing is amazing. But the one in question, disc one, seems to get the bad reviews... why would that be? I've seen people say that they haven't written good songs and it is all about flash and how fast they can play, yet turn around and say that disc 2 is a masterpiece... well shucks. That confuses me a bit because there is hardly ANY fast playing on disc 1 with the exception of most of JP's solo's or JR's, most of the real techincal odd time stuff is on the second disc, so that makes no sense to me. But anyway, yeah i could see the songs on the first disc losing 2-3 minutes each and it not affecting the song, maybe even making them better, but by no means does it feel like they were purposely going &quot;ok, let's write ALL long songs just so that we seem complex&quot;. And the fans that say that they haven't written anything good since I&amp;W... well i won't attack them and say they can't think that but both SFAM and 6DoIT seem miles more mature than that (I&amp;W is my 3rd favorite BTW), both emotionally and stylistically to me. The only thing i can see that people might not enjoy is the heavier direction DT has taken since then, the songs are MUCH heavier, but don't let that fool you into thinking something silly like heavier=sellout or something like that (and yeah i've heard people say stuff like that) <br />One thing i really liked that was different about this album was LaBrie's vocals. They have changed immensely since I&amp;W, and to these ears for the better. I have always felt the weakest link in most prog bands was the vocalist with the silly falsetto and super wide vibrato, i never liked that but beared with it because the underlying music was so good. On this album LaBrie has toned down the vibrato and sings lower than he has in the past which really is much more pleasing to my ears to hear than the whiny vibrato he showed on Images &amp; Words. One thing i always thought had merit in Pop and R&amp;B music was the singers... always had smooth, subtle vibrato and very pleasing tone (Brian McKnight or Michael Jackson come to mind, or from Nu Metal Lajon of Sevendust or The guy from Finger 11) and as much as most prog fans hate that kind of music i don't think it should carry over into hating the way the singers sing although it naturally does. Those guys are mind blowing singers. I hear LaBrie slowly moving a bit into that direction, which is much more pleasing to me. The only prog singers i have really enjoyed are Daniel Gildenlow of Pain Of Salvation and Russel Allen of Symphony X... and if you count it Lawrence Mackory as the session singer for Andromeda (go buy that disc BTW... phenominal)<br />I am really pleased with this disc and though i've only heard each disc through about 10 times it stands high in the DT Catalogue right behind SFAM as my favorite album. I think that the people who have given it bad reviews who are fans of &quot;old time&quot; DT circa I&amp;W should give it a few more listens... i am seeing all these bad reviews that surely aren't deserving. If you have any interest in Dream Theater this is one of the albums you need to own. Don't pass it up for whatever reason you might have because it is surely deserving of your attention and once again one of the best progressive metal releases ever.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I first saw The Godfather when I was 15; it was one of those films that made me fall in love with the possibilities of film art.  In watching the original and two following films over the years, it never fails to amaze me how many new things I see each time, some subtle and other so obvious it's a wonder I didn't catch it on the first (or third or thirtieth) viewing.<br />This is a definitive collection of an American masterpiece.
0380817683|5.0|Rachel's Holiday is my hands-down favorite. She tackles the really touchy topic of addiction without coming across as didactic. And, as with all her books, you still get to laugh out loud. One tiny criticism: I could have done without the Hollywood ending -- but it's still a great read.
0375703861|2.0|Somewhat interesting, but slow reading.  My personal annoyance is her complete misrepresentation of Jehovah's Witnesses.  At first I thought it was amusing and a great basis for a character.  However, I am personally acquainted with many Witnesses, and her many mistakes in describing their beliefs is disturbing.  I realize that this is a novel and it involves fictional characters, but she misstates so much that it erodes my belief in anything she has written about other characters and their customs and  backgrounds, be it Islamic, Bengali, East Indian, West Indian, British,  or whatever. She is completely non-credible as an author.  Try again.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I don't know what people expect from Dream Theater, but this album is definitely a Dream Theater album. We all knew what was due: excellent musicianship, intelligent orchestration, complex compositions, strong lyrics, density and tensity, virtuoso passages... Well, all this &quot;6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; delivers big time. You can say it's all been there and done, but then, no one does it the way they do it. The way THEY do it - with EVERY album - makes us fans tick. You should dive in too.
0312853238|5.0|I picked up this book at the advice of a friend.  I read it, and loved it...then lent it to a friend.  Everyone who read it gave it to a friend to read...and everyone loved it.  I read the rest of the series and it got a bit \\"crazy\\", but this book is one you dare not pass up!!!
6305426694|5.0|A Civil Action is a great look at the judicial system and how one man defied the odds to get justice for the common man. Even though this film was a box office flop it should've been nominated for Best Picture instead of the ... so called comedy Life Is Beautiful
0066620996|5.0|I've read many books on the subject of business, and this is easily among the best I ever came across. Collins and his team made a valuable contribution to the business community by researching the reasons why some companies are able to get out of the 'good' territory and into the 'great' territory. The findings are not just abstract conclusions, but rather specific ones supported by empirical data. We all read business books that claim to have methods for improving productivity or motivation or whatever, and finished them without really gaining anything new. Well this isnt one of those books. The information is supported by numerous examples that one can relate to, and hence while you read it you can relate to it and compare numerous situations to ones you might have experienced during your professional life.<BR>This books is well written and presented in logical order, so you will not get lost in the middle, and the data interconnects nicely to give the reader an overall vision on where to go in order to achieve greatness in business life.<BR>This book is not a step by step instructional publication on what to do to become great, but it is a great source of other peoples experiences that can give you a long-term vision on where you should head of you want to make the leap from good to great.<BR>A nice complement/follow up to this book would be Jack: Straight From the Gut (read my review over there).

B00005UEAR|2.0|It's rare that I'll write a negative review of an album, but this is one of those not-so-rare cases where a band falls prey to cliche while still appearing to progress.<br />6DoIT has some good aspects: technically, DT can't be knocked, and despite being somewhat pretentious, there is at least some variety in the music.  Unfortunately, that's where the &quot;good aspects&quot; end. <br />Other reviews will delve into each individual song, so I'll just stick to the generalities: Dream Theater is relying on the same formula that made SFAM, Transatlantic, Explorer's Club, and a whole host of other neo-prog releases relatively successful.  They go into much-overdone lyrical matter, make musical changes that go from cliched prog-heavy to cliched prog-lite...menacing minors to weepy majors.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the so-called &quot;Overture.&quot;<br />Ruddess has taken a major chunk of the compositional pie since he joined the band, and that is far more to their musical detriment than their gain.  Moore added dimension and originality to the band (for proof of his compositional ability, check out Chroma Key), and Sherinian added an edge.  Ruddess adds cliche, redundancy, and playing ability that is just as flashy as Rick Wakeman's was in the '70's...and just as unnecessary.<br />Finally, the production is once again a shambles.  Portnoy and Petrucci are great musicians, but the problem with them handling the production of DT's last two albums is that it leaves no-one to objectively tell them what sounds good, and what sounds cliched and overdone.  The mix itself is rather flat, with no dynamic shifts.<br />Ultimately, with a few minor exceptions, it seems that Dream Theater has become so accustomed to being called a &quot;prog&quot; band, that they have finally compromised their musical integrity and become what everyone has said they are.  From now on, I don't expect anything to bring them back to originality.  It's a damn shame, as their pure ability and musicianship deserves to be set free of any pretentions.
B000002IP1|5.0|i bought this album when i was about 13.NOw 25, hearing it for the first time in years brings back some fantastic memories..i haven't listened to any Phil Collins stuff in years and to hear this album recently reminds me that this is his finest moment.amazing tracks,'Find a way to my heart'..'something happened on the way to heaven' and the amazing ' i wish it would rain down'... uplifting,jazzy, heartbreaking....one album to remember..
B000002NFM|3.0|Fat of the Land is a decent album. There are goos songs like firestarter and diesal power. However, the album gets really repetive quickly. After listening to the album a few times, it's very easy to get tired of it.
B00003CXXP|5.0|People who have previewed the dvd have observed that it is very high quality, an excellent transfer, and nearly reference grade. Its content is heavily weighted toward the technical aspects of the film and special effects.  These may or may not help you understand A.I., which is, by many accounts, a deep allegorical puzzle.  Spielberg has never before made a film which ventures - no, bursts - into such new territory.  If it's possible for a film to light the sky like a super nova, A.I. may be it.  If critics had issues with A.I., it was usually due to its pairing of Spielberg and Kubrick.  Film critics are notorious for pithy remarks.  One critic said the film was as if the specter of a dead film maker had arisen from his grave and sucked the life out of a living one.  In my mind, this may be a valid point, because A.I. is not the film that a critic in my local paper led me to believe it to be, and it is not the film I wanted Spielberg to make.  A.I. is another monument to Kubrick, though I don't believe it needed to be.  I wanted A.I. to be Spielberg's vision.  It's his film but not his vision.  Nevertheless, I have learned to appreciate A.I. for itself.  It's a wonderful film.  It is clearly a >>masterpiece<<.  Another critic opined that Spielberg took Kubrick's vision for his project and accomplished what Kubrick would have done: repel audiences.  There is truth in that point, too, only Kubrick would have made an R rated film, not one rated PG-13.  Actually, I think Spielberg did a better job than Kubrick, who couldn't see a way to make the film.  This makes Spielberg a better film maker, in my mind, and A.I. a unique treasure.
0307165485|5.0|This was one of my FAVORITE books when I was growing up!  My parents still have the book (now getting in tatters -- cover missing, some pages starting to come off), but my 7 year old niece found it and she absolutely loves it too!<br />I figured this book was loooonnnnnggggg out of print, so imagine my surprise (not to mention my delight!) when I saw it was available!  I quickly ordered it so now I can share it with my son, and hope this becomes one of his favorite books as he grows up!<br />Reviewing the book, I see that I love this book for its innocence and simplicity ... no questionable messages, no characters that have all sorts of product tie-ins, like is so common today.  This is something every child (and parent!) needs.<br />By the way, this book is on William J. Bennett's list of books every child should read, which appears in his book The Educated Child.<br />Give you child a wonderful gift ... it is money well-spent, and this will be a gift that will be used for years.
0684867621|4.0|Being a Redsox fan made this book very enjoyable for me although it would have been just as enjoyable if it had been the Yankees that the little girl fell to sleep listening to every night (well maybe not AS enjoyable) However, the story is beautifully written and although it's short, it leaves nothing out. The way King describes the landscapes makes you feel like you're right there in the woods with the little girl. And i promise that you WILL cry at the end.
B00000J8EK|4.0|I first became a chemical brothers fan through dig your own hole so naturally I had high expectations for this album. Surrender is a pretty good album, but I don't think it really has the same level of excitmenr or creativity as previous albums.
6304708521|4.0|1) This a Beatle Movie<BR>2) Don't expect much else!<br />To be perfectly honest, as far as story goes, this movie [is not good]! Keeping that in mind, and not looking for much more than a parade of music videos strung together by a very loose plot, it's fantastic (for music alone). Don't get me wrong, most of this movie is more than enjoyable, but it can't be taken seriously, and shouldn't. That's the point. Give it a view, it's fun.<br />Great Scenes:<BR>1) Aunt Jessica's dream (lots of food, lost of spaghetti!)<BR>2) Blue Jay Way <BR>3) Flying<BR>4) Death cab for cutie
B00005QDW1|5.0|Since I have gotten this CD it hasnt come out of my player. I listen to it non stop, already know all the words. Its different from prior CDs but still, No Doubt comes through with it's own unique style. It isnt quite as punk/ska as the others, I hear a little more pop and reggae in it, but as I said before, it has it's own unique \\"No Doubt\\" touch! I love it BUY IT! Preview these songs:<br />Hey Baby<BR>Waiting Room<BR>and RockSteady
B000002LRX|5.0|Angel Dust is so densely layered with sound it's almost like it came from Mike Patton's other band, Mr. Bungle.  Only this album manages to be more streamlined and focused than Mr. Bungle without losing the complexity. <br />Patton's fluidly mutable voice is reason enough to buy this album, but the instrumental work, especially the keyboards, is equally inspired.<br />Faith No More is constantly assaulting.  It's the best of metal, blues, hip hop, comedy, and horror movie soundtrack all wrapped up without being contrived or repetitive for even a second.
0471413909|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  I have a degree in dietetics, and I have tried to follow the Food Guide Pyramid for years.  For years, the weight has just kept on piling up.  This book really does make eating easier.  You don't have to count calories, carbs, or anything else.  <BR>As a nutritionist, I know the dangers of high protein, high fat, no carb diets.  These dangers include calcium loss from the bones, excess ketone buildup, constipation and other problems.  For those reasons, I do not recommend high protein diets and would never go on one.  But this book is different.  You can eat all the carbs you want, as long as they are the right kind *fruits and non-starchy veggies*.  You get lots of fiber and adequate calcium.  This diet is truly healthy.  I analyzed several days worth of meals with the FoodWorks program, and this diet is very high in vitamins and minerals, as well as fiber.  It has also cut my calories in half, and I've lost four pounds this first week.  For those who are worried about giving up favorite foods forever, the diet allows two open meals a week, at which you can eat grains and dairy.<BR>   I also ordered &quot;Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy&quot; by Walter Willett, an M.D. at Harvard who heads up some long term nutrition studies.  I recommend this book to those who are interested in research or a second opinion.  Many of the paleo diet points are echoed in Dr. Willett's book.  After reading these two books, I don't see how they could fail to convince anyone.
B000009EAD|5.0|He really cannot.  Once again, he and the band Iced Earth have made a spectacular album, althogh it's a little slick on the production.  You don't get the good crunch of the guitars like on earlier albums, but what the Hell.  While not every song is an Iced classic, there isn't one of them that is intolerable.  For people wishing for the good 80s metal in an age of nu metal, Iced Earth is your own savior.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I am a huge Roswell fan, so naturally, I purchased Dido's No Angel, for Roswell's theme song, Here With Me.<br />Wow!  I was so surprised to find all of her songs just incredible!  Each song holds meaning and is more than just music.<br />This was by far, the best CD I purchased in 2001.  Highly recommended.
B000000OQF|5.0|GNR . . . easily the most influential band of the eighties, and even though they did not last as a group, they did hang on,and are still one of the best bands ever.  This, their debut albm, remained on the billboard charts for over 3 years.  If you are one of the people who like to listen to albums front to back, this should be yours.  Axl's vocals are earth shattering, Slash's guitars will send chills up your spine, Izzy does rythem guitar like none other,  and Duff whales on the base.  What more could you ask for . . . how about 10 great songs and 2 good ones
B00005Y1Y3|5.0|All the songs are not included in any other CD previously released.<BR>Really a great choice.
B000002J1O|5.0|This is an *excellent* collection, and any attempt to put it into words will almost certainly fail miserably. To me, this is a bit more complex than 1972's _Foxtrot_, with even more literate-based landscapes, extended instrumental sections, tricky time signatures/rhythms, and imagination in general, yet concisely arranged and tight throughout.<br /><br />It starts with \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight,\\" which starts in a nighttime lullalby fashion; this track has a gleaming twinkle in sound that shines as bright as the Moon. From there it goes from mellow stylings of folk and r&b-guitar, which eventually explodes into a collage of idiosyncratic, yet theatrical vocals, operatic mellotron and then heavy rock. The theatrical quality and overall sophisticated sounds of this track pretty much foreshadow the kinds of sounds you will hear throughout the entire album. \\"I Know What I Like,\\" is based on the cover artwork and is pretty easy listening; probably the most \\"straightforward\\" track on the album. \\"Firth Of Fifth\\" is another epic on here with more storytelling. Once again, the extended instrumental chops, especially Tony Banks' keyboards, shine brightly. Listen to some of the tricky rhythms on here<br /><br />\\"More Fool Me\\" is a soft and pretty ballad. This time Phil Collins does the vocal duties, against the backdrop of the complex chords of Steve Hackett. Some would say that this track foreshadowed what would come of Genesis in the 80s.<br /><br />\\"The Battle Of Epping Forest\\" is based on a news article about two gangs fighting over land or something of the like. (Note: If you read the lyrics in the sleeve to this song -- for this remastered edition -- you will notice that a certain section in this song is listed as the lyrics to \\"After The Ordeal,\\" which is an instrumental, so keep that in mind.)<br /><br />Anyway, \\"Epping Forest\\" is probably the most quirky on here fearuring Peter Gabriel using a series of different voices to portray many different characters, almost like a mini-play. As always the music is very intricate, with loads of drama, and time changes (again, try to listen to the rhythms here, and work out the time signatures that this band uses. Very unique and interesting.)<br /><br />\\"After The Ordeal,\\" is an ethereal and absorbing instrumental, as I've noted earlier. \\"The Cinema Show\\" is arguably the highlight of the disc. Definitely the climactic point. It's divided into two halves. The first features the romantic, imaginative and dreamy soundscapes (and lyrics), and features some mythological references. It clocks in at nearly six minutes. The last half is the all out instrumental jam in 7/8. This instrumental jam is right up there with Apocalypse in 9/8 from _Foxtrot_'s \\"Supper's Ready.\\" This features creative and tasteful drumming from Phil, complex chord changes from Steve Hackett, solid, anchoring basslines from Mike Rutherford, and of course the spotlight belongs to the leads of Tony Banks. The keyboard playing on here is phenomenal, and full of atmosphere, eventually bringing it to an eerie keyboard reprise of \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight,\\" which is followed by Steve Hackett's classical guitar. This now becomes \\"Aisle of Plenty\\" with Peter Gabriel's quirky vocals.<br /><br />This album is *unbelievable*, and as mentioned above, words alone couldn't do it justice, and even then, how could I really describe it? It's one of my *absolute* favorite albums in rock, period. I would recommend this to prog-rock fans who don't already own this, as well as people who like original, challenging and imaginative music.ys the music is very intricate, with loads of drama, and time changes (again, try to listen to the rhythms here, and work out the time signatures that this band uses.

B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles are easily the greatest band in history. The breadth of their talent and innovations is immeasurable. Out of many great, however, this is best. Abbey Road is unshackled, Revolver is wildly influential, Rubber Soul is down-home, Sgt. Pepper is innovative and incredible, but the White Album is the best simply because of the sheer breadth of the styles it covers. Lennon has many of his best songs, including his two best ballads, Dear Prudence and Julia, his most depressing and honest song, Yer Blues, debuts his classic, Revolution, and slows it down, runs all over the place with Revolution 9, name drops a bunch of Beatles tunes in Glass Onion, writes a hauntigly surreal number, Happiness is a Warm Gun, and reflects on Cry Baby Cry. McCartney, while not as far-reaching, sure as hell does a lot. Whether it's proto-metal on Helter Skelter, dancehall ska on Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da, a Beach Boys send-up on Back in the U.S.S.R., a celebratory rocker on Birthday, introspective pop on Blackbird, or mock-country storytelling on Rocky Raccoon, McCartney is doing the best songs in his canon. Harrison, though limited to just four songs, reaches almost as far, with the melodic sadness of While My Guitar Gently Weeps, the silly ditty Piggies, the haunting ballad Long, Long, Long, or the soul of Savoy Truffle. Ringo ends up writing a half-decent song, one of only two he actually wrote with the Beatles, with the carnival romp Don't Pass me By. The most eclectic, non-cohesive, free-form record in history.
0679601686|4.0|although some may not notice it, this Austen novel is romantically-centered. The subtlety of the liaison between Darcy and Elizabeth and their psychological games leave the reader with the impression that the protagonist is doomed to spinsterhood, while her sisters one by one are exfoliated away by their respective bridegrooms.<br />It's not until towards the conclusion of the story that Austen finally gratifies her desires by ( spoiler! ) bringing Darcy and Eliza together. Romance, courtship, and flirtation perceived as daring back in Austen's pre-Victorian era are so uncouth and perplexing to the modern reader that he/ she might miss out on a truly light-hearted romantic comedy with ludic characters and good-natured humor.<br />This is one of Austen's finest works and I regard her as one of the great writers, female or otherwise.
B00004TDRD|5.0|Jaws is an excellent movie. The specials effects are superb. The fisherman is weird. The mayor is wearing a topet. But see this movie.
B00000DHTF|5.0|Maybe Bob Dylan and Frank Zappa are the only two American artists as prolific as Bruce.  This set is not even close to the definitive listing of the unreleased material that Bruce has collected from all of his sessions.  What we have here are the songs that Bruce has chose for us to hear.  A glimpse.  And what we have is pure genius at work.  I can't even imagine how difficult it must be to decide what songs stay and go on one of his records.  The E Street bands sound incredible on these recordings.
B000002AH9|5.0|Each minute of this masterpiece is heartbreaking.  Miss Holiday was a woman of depth, perception and courage with her various demons looming large.  It was this album that first turned me on to Billie Holiday.  Her voice is raw, broken, gritty but she sings each note with an honesty that lays ground in your brain.  This album will haunt you!  &quot;You Don't Know What Love Is,&quot; &quot;You've Changed&quot; and especially &quot;Glad to Be Unhappy&quot;  are sketches of the worst in relationships.  Torch singers don't really exist anymore, which is unfortunate.  Here is the best there ever was.
B00005RHGL|4.0|After loving this movie for so long (probably Val Kilmers best role) I was very excited to see it re-released as a deluxe edition. The 5.1 audio upgrade really makes a difference over the previous 2.0 DVD. Now the bullets wiz buy and tumbleweed well, tumbles by. The picture is great, this movie really looks good on a large screen and was made for DVD. Some of the features are better than others. I thought the timeline was very informational, especially if you like this western as you learn the truth from the fiction. The Epitaph while not an exciting piece is also interesting to read the real newspaper account from way back when it actually happened. And to see the ads in the paper was cool too. There is a ROM game, which is a lot of fun, and re-playable which is always a plus in my humble opinion. If you like to gamble then install this on your PC. There are a ton of trailers and while they don't interest me too much it is interesting to see how many ways a movie can be spun. <br />Kudos and thumbs up on the new version and the cool bonus.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Spielberg at his best. This tale is both uplifting and tragic. It shows the way an adolescent boy looks at his mother. Eventhough the length could've been truncated, it is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen!
B00003CXI1|5.0|I have seen this movie already three times in the theaters, and I am planning to buy the DVD widescreen version.  One of the things that most impressed me is that may three year old child was mesmerized by the film and did not fall to sleep both times that he has seen it.<br />JK Rowlings did a wonderful job of writing a book so interesting.  I believe that the most amazing aspect of the story is that it is about everyday life at a not so common school.<br />The film is almost like reading the book.  No complaint about it.  It is still nice to read the book, but the film brings into being the wonderful caracters of Harry and Hermione.<br />If you have not read the book, the vocabulary may be a little difficult, so that you have to see it at least twice.  If you read the book is just wonderful to watch the movie.<br />I give it five stars for the wonderful story telling and imagination.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|I decided to rent the \\"Shrek\\" dvd because I wanted to know why everyone thought this movie was so great--I didn't go and see it in the theaters. I have to say that it was TERRIBLE! Much of the jokes were so unfunny, and I don't understand why they say this is a kid's movie...it seems more like an adult movie to me! Sure, some of the jokes were funny, but they weren't fall-on-the-floor-laughing hilarious--I only ended up smiling at the jokes and only slightly laughed. And believe me, I DO have a good sense of humor, I just didn't find the jokes in \\"Shrek\\" to be all that funny.<br />\\"Shrek\\" is about an old lonely troll who hates everyone...but really just wishes he had someone who loved him. A simple, predictable childish plot with adult humor that makes it seem like it's more enjoyable.<br />Now the dvd is actually pretty good, which is unfortunate since it was a bad movie. I don't think the dvd is worth purchasing if you didn't like the film. Nice special features and good, clear picture quality. The acting is okay in \\"Shrek\\", though I have to say that I am not a huge fan of Mike Myers, since I also think his \\"Austin Powers\\" movies are quit annoying. Eddie Murphy and John Lithgrow were the best in it...and Cameron Diaz was pretty good, too. <br />I honestly really tried to like \\"Shrek\\". My sisters and friends all loved it, but I have to say that I didn't like it at all. I really hope there is no \\"Shrek 2\\". Besides, what would the plot be like? Oh well. I'm sure Dreamworks could think of something to poke fun of.<br />This is not really a kid's movie because a lot of the jokes are geared toward adults. Some of the jokes are pretty toilet-dirty, and others are just plain bad that nobody can really understand or relate to. <br />\\"Shrek\\" was not for EVERYBODY...and not for me, either. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Needless to say, from the first time I viewed the movie I loved it. The DVD reminds me why. Those who didn't like it much, who hated it, or were confused by it, will find the Commentary track especially illuminating. Luhrmann and Pearce are absolutely mad! And brilliant. Listening to the track made me realize just how good the movie is. The very intentions these two guys had for the many devices they used in the film were the very ones I responded to. Which tells us one important thing that the non-Moulin Rouge lovers don't get: They knew EXACTLY what they were doing.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|MOULIN ROUGE was a beautiful film...it wasn't just another sappy love story. I rented the DVD and watched it with my family. They all thought it was great! Though at the end, my family didn't stay to watch all of the DVD special features...I watched them though so I could review this DVD. Now I know where all these good reviews are coming from. What I don't understand is where all these bad reviews are coming from. What's not to like about MOULIN ROUGE? It has it all: comedy, music, dance, romance, drama...I could go on. Plus, the sceneary is absolutely breathtaking, and the actors are a joy to watch.<br />The film takes place in 1900 Paris, France. The Moulin Rouge is a theatre where a performer's dreams can come true. It's a theatre where the rich come to watch fantastic, thrilling shows and have a good time. There, Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a poor writer, who's never fallen in love before. Christian gets a private interview with the beautiful Satine (Nicole Kidman) who will do anything to become a star. Satine is supposed to marry the Duke (who owns the Moulin Rouge), because he is the one who can make her a star. But when Satine meets Christian, she falls in love with him...and he falls in love with her. Now, they must hide their forbidden love from the Duke, who would become incredibly jealous if he found out about their affair.<br />Never had I imagined that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman could sing! Ewan McGregor's vocals are especially strong and powerful, and he pulls off all his songs very well. Nicole Kidman is also just as flawless as a singer. She definitely can carry a tune--her vocals fit perfectly with Ewan McGregor's. The music is enchanting, and the best song is probably &quot;Come What May&quot;. The costumes and sceneary are also incredible pieces of art. <br />The DVD is just as amazing. There are 2 discs, and they come together in a beautiful box. The special features include the music videos of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; by Christina Aguilera, Pink, Mya, and Lil' Kim, &quot;Come What May&quot; by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, and the full MTV Movie Awards performance of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. Other special features are the making of MOULIN ROUGE, interviews with director Baz Luhrmann, stars Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, and other members of the cast. Also gives an insight on the dance numbers, the cast of MOULIN ROUGE, and more. The picture and sound quality are excellent, too.<br />I highly recommend this film to everyone...not just musical lovers. It's a must-own DVD!
B00005QG9J|1.0|i bought this cd with high expectations. i thought that after make yourself i would hear something more close to S.C.I.E.N.C.E. or even maybe fungusamungus and enjoy incubus, the best of them all. What i heard was not the incubus i once knew. what i heard was something more like various other bands today, such as Hoobastank..., they sound like hoobastank and all the other emotional music out there now. This cd is not compleatly awful, but most of the tracks are uninspired and forgettable, unlike the previous albums which featured unique and generally strange but good lyrics. This cd has a few good tracks, but the best is definatly circles, which is remenisant of better days. On the whole, i would not recommend this cd. Why? because older incubus is much better....
0345442989|3.0|Luceno puts in a fine effort, but Cloak of Deception does not live up to the standard he set with his Agents of Chaos duology.  The fault does not lie in the plot at all.  On the contrary, Luceno does an excellent job of shedding light on the background to the Phantom Menace.  We are able to see Palpatine the master politician, seeming to support every Senatorial faction, gaining the respect and trust of the most powerful Senators.  Luceno also tells us just what the \\"taxation of outlying systems\\" - the causus belli in Phantom Menace - is all about.  And we learn just how those \\"baseless\\" rumors of Valorum's corruption began.  Those alone make Cloak of Deception worth any Star Wars fan's time.<br />Unfortunately, Cloak of Deception suffers from the same fault as Episode I itself.  We just don't care about any of the characters.  There was something inherently likeable about Luke, Han, and Leia in Episode IV; we felt for Luke when he lost Owen, Beru, and Ben.  We cheered when Han returned to help Luke destroy the Death Star.  And we felt euphoria when Leia presented medals to our heroes.  With Phantom Menace, however, there was too much of a distance between us and the characters.  It's hard to care for Padme, for example, when she herself is playing a role; we never get to see the *real* Padme.<br />Cloak of Deception suffers from the same problem.  Valorum is almost assassinated, and we don't care.  Qui-Gon defies the Jedi Council and we are not impressed.  Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter does a much better job of drawing us into the characters' lives.<br />For enlightenment into the plot of Phantom Menace, Cloak of Deception is a must read.  Casual fans, however, would do better to read Shadow Hunter or a Rogue Squadron book.
B000002B7W|5.0|It's hard to believe that it has been twenty years since the death of Randy Rhodes. I remember coming home to my parent's house that evening and seeing the news reporting on Randy's death. Back then I enjoyed his playing, but never really got in to him. As the years passed, my interest in Randy grew and my appreciation for his music grew.<br />The album starts off with \\"I Don't Know\\" coming in without an intro (most likely taken out of the middle of a set and mixed in for the album). The album continues with probably the most inspiring and powerful Ozzy/Randy song \\"Crazy Train\\" running the track at full speed. \\"Believer\\", \\"Mr. Crowley\\", and \\"Flying High Again\\" follow, all showcasing Randy's playing. The songs are all taken up a notch from their studio originals. \\"Steal Away (The Night)\\" is just balls to the wall and features a drum solo from Tommy Aldridge who I feel is one of the best metal drummers out there still today. \\"Suicide Solution\\" follows and features a guitar solo from Randy. For a lot of guitar players the solo allows them to shine, but Randy shines throughout the album. \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"Children of the Grave\\" rock the album along with a nice intensity. On \\"Paranoid\\" the band gives the Sabbath hit and extra kick in the ass. \\"Goodbye to Romance\\" and \\"No Bone Movies\\" close out the live portion of the disc nicely. I think it would have been more appropriate to close with \\"Goodbye To Romance\\" since so many Ozzy fans look at that as a song Ozzy wrote for Randy even though Randy performed on it.<br />As a special treat, the final cut is Randy's out-takes on the song \\"Dee\\" with Randy talking during his takes. The booklet contains many photos of Randy and has liner notes from Randy's mom Delores and a letter from Ozzy. In the letter, Ozzy states that \\"What you are about to hear are the only live recordings of Randy and I, they were recorded in 81.\\" If these are the only live recordings of Randy, that is a real shame that his fans were not left with more.<br />...<br />The disc features all of the best tunes Ozzy and Randy performed together. In 1995, the album was re-mastered and re-released. If you can pick up an original, that's the way to go. If your an Ozzy and/or Randy, fan this is a must for your collection..<br />The disc features all of the best tunes Ozzy and Randy performed together.

B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie is probably the best movie of the year.This movie was very well made and kept the viewers attention through the entire movie.Many people say that it was more Hollywood than it was Historical,dough of course it is,however this movie does a good job in reminding Americans of Pearl Harbor and the many brave souls were lost there.Awesome special effects,and historical significant.It's a must see film,if you don't see this movie you'll kick-yourself the rest of your life.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Exhausting madcap editing, pop collage sensibilities, a soundtrack that epitomizes eclectic, a love story in which everything is a breathless impression and the actors don't so much play their roles as embody them. Baz Luhrman pulls this all together in a way that I really enjoy. Call me a member of the MTV generation--I don't watch MTV, but you're welcome to. Gross historical inaccuracies and a chronological mash-up that combines show-tunes with Nirvana with Madonna serve to capture the exhilarating freedom of the bohemian revolution even as the finale evokes its disintegration. It's true to the spirit of the age, at least, and I recommend it.
B00003CXTG|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen.When they started to bomb Pearl Harbor I could feel my heart beat going faster and faster.Even the romance thing wasn't that bad and the soundtrack from Hans Zimmer is excellent by the way.Great visuals and the best effects I have ever seen.
B00003CXTG|2.0|This movie was an hour longer than it should have been.  Combining stale, overused cliches snatched from every possible story in Hollywood, Pearl Harbor plods through its first two thirds, introducing a nicely pat romance and a conviniently unrealistic love triangle before we can finish dozing off.  After it gets going, it manages to come off as insincere and manipulative as it throws scenes stolen from other movies at us one after the other, culminating with the award-winning Cuba Gooding Jr. getting a bit part to play the role of the heroic black man, quickly becoming a sad cliche.  True, the battle scenes were fairly well done, which accounts for the extra star.  But even after sitting through two hours of a cheap Titantic remake, when the flag was finally raised and the movie started hitting its stride, I came out not having gone through anything profound--compare this overblown monstrosity to Black Hawk Down, for instance, which managed to give tribute without being pedantic.   It saddens me, especially in light of recent events, that this was all they could pull off.  Pearl Harbor deserves better.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Great Special Effects and great action sequences.I would add this movie and Saving Private Ryan to your video library so that your children can watch history  instead of just remembering dates and events of WW2.I recommend this movie to everyone who wants a touching story.
B00005NC66|4.0|If you don't see this with the proper context, it can be a bit of a headscratcher as to why this movie is important.  It's a bit like watching \\"Birth of a Nation\\"; it's hard to get that sense of \\"D.W. Griffith was there FIRST\\", especially since the film's content is, to say the least, appalling.  <BR>So, in a nutshell: French film between the 40s and the 60s was largely focused on big, lavish literary adaptations.  It was staid, it was pretty vapid in some respects artistically (although there are some very beautiful films from that time such as \\"Children of Paradise\\", available from the Criterion Collection), and it was safe for the unwashed masses, despite the artistic world surrounding it.  You also have to remember that at the time, films weren't considered art by the academics of the day, they were \\"mere\\" entertainment.<BR>A group of filmmakers decided to try and change this, and the country got swept up.  \\"Breathless\\" was something totally new and different and furthermore, it made a mint at the box office (not a commonly mentioned fact, but part of the reason the New Wave took off was that the early films made money)  If you followed the American indie scene in the mid-90s, it was much the same way; ANYBODY could get a movie made, and there were stunning surprise hits.<br />So that's why \\"Breathless\\" is so important and why so many people love it.<br />That said, as an actual movie, it's dated, both from the fact that its techniques have been ripped off so many times and the fact that in a simple technical straightforward sense, it wasn't that good a movie in the first place.<BR>Visually, it is excellent.  All those using DV camcorders now would do well to imitate Godard's use of handheld camerawork; it's obvious he meticulously planned every shot and didn't just improvise like a lot of them.  He knows how to frame his shots and how to use camera motion.  Actingwise, especially considering the script, it's also quite enjoyable.<BR>If you don't want to read criticism of this film, stop reading; I give this three stars on the above merits plus one star for historical value.<br />In other respects, it's horrendous.  \\"Breathless\\" never develops a point; the plot is ill considered and more often than not feels like an inept parody of American B-movies, not a tribute.  Unlike the movies he's imitating, \\"Breathless\\" has no sense of urgency and offers us no reason to care about the characters, especially the lead, who's basically just another jerk.  I'm unimpressed by Godard's constant film referencing or the placement of some of his jump cuts; they add nothing.<BR>Part of this is, as I said, the fact that the film has been ripped off so many times that its techniques are no longer new.  But just sit down with some work from Welles, Powell and Pressburger, Yasujiro Ozu, Bunuel, or Alfred Hitchock, watch that and then \\"Breathless\\", and you realize that they have something Godard doesn't; a care for the story in addition to the care for the images.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I have to say that I was quite disappointed in this movie.I was hoping to see more bloodshed and action.This movie was too long and drawn out.There were more love scenes in it than I anticipated.I did not see too many trailers for this movie,just heard a hype on the radio.Before watching this movie,I had no idea Japan had attacked America because we stopped providing them with Oil supplies.So,I guess Oil for all countries is a big deal after all.The acting was shoddy.The characters were not as believable to me as I had hoped them to be.Maybe it was because they did not get this huge salary to play their parts in this film.When the fighter pilots went over to Japan in the bombers,I was quite upset.It was not their job to go and avenge the Japanese in their suprise attack on Pearl Harbor.I could have sworn the movie was strictly about what took place in Pearl Harbor on Dec 7,1941.The story line kept changing and it made it difficult to stick with.I kept moving my chair and was itching to leave.If producers were going to continue the film with our boys going to Japan,there should have been another two hours of movie time to show the film where our bombs built by openhelmer were actually made and dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end WW2.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Shrek is the best kind of a comedy. From the opening credits to the last moment of screentime I was laughing my head off in fear I'd wet my pants. It rips on Disney big time, but that's one of its greatest treats. From the multible occurences of fairytale creatures (most of whom are convently from a Disney movie) to Lord Farccads (sp?) kingdom which bares a strange resembelence to Disney World, this movie understands the pleasure in a good ol fashion Mouse Bashing (and why not with the poorly made sequals Disney has been poping out with recently that insult their earlier masterpieces just to make some MORE money).<br />Some people may claim this movie is not approperate for children. People, there are only two \\"pottie\\" jokes in this feature, one in the opening credits that I missed the first time I watched it. There's really only one reference that I wouldn't let my cousions watch, the part upon seeing Lord what's his names castle and Shrek goes \\"Do you think he's making up for something?\\" (well actually they touch on that joke again when the Donkey goes \\"and I think Shrek means he thinks Lord something has a really small-). That's why it's rated PG. Besides these jokes, everything else is perfectly fine for children who I'm sure have seen Disney movies and are perfectly capable of laughing at them. <br />I personally found Shrek lovable. He's this old grouch, but it's so refreshing to see a hero in a animated movie with a temper. As the Donkey says \\"You've got that I don't care what nobody thinks of me thing, I like that. I respect that\\". So do I. The Donkey had me in stiches. Many of his jokes would not be funny on paper, but are funny because Eddie Murphy is a comical genius. Ex: \\"I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder\\" The princess is sassy, and adds heart to this feature. The Lord guy has some great visual gags, although the gingerbread man really stole a lot of scenes from him.<br />I've heard some people bash this movie because they think the \\"true\\" theme is the opposite of what it seems to be. Namely, that the movie is REALLY saying fat, ugly people deserve to be with other fat, ugly people. Honestly, I think this is a case where people delve too deeply into a work of arts message. Shrek needed a plot twist. If Princess Fiana stayed a princess the second act would have had no conflict. Shrek do not concentrate on \\"theme\\", it doesn't take itself seriously as few comedies do. It concentrates on laughter, jokes and being a funny movie (which it is). My favorite scene? The look on Shrek's face after the \\"It's a Small World\\" number. Priceless.
B000059HAI|5.0|What makes this movie so good is the cooperation between both sides. The movie was done by two separater groups, with directors, camera crews, and actors in both America and Japan. It was created as a joint effort from both countries. They did a great job putting it together. As the scenes change, you go from the commanders on the Japanese ships preparing for the attack, to the unprepared, Americans. My favorite line in the movie, basically sums up the U.S.'s readiness of the event. The men watching the radar ask how they should report anything odd that turns up on the radar, and the commander responds that there is a gas station about a mile down the road. \\"They must have a phone.\\"<br />The best part of the movie is the battle. It lasts a good half hour, with special effects that rival \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" although the budget for \\"Tora! Tora! Tora! was much smaller, and it's older. The special effects are amazing, and it almost feels like you are at the battle.<br />This movie goes into detail, beyond what they taught you in school, to give you the full story of the attack on Pearl Harbor, from both sides. It's great for anyone, as the Japanese enjoy it as much as I do. I recommend this movie without reservation to everyone.
B00005QCVY|5.0|Why can't Hollywood make positive, warm-hearted movies like this anymore?!? This film, along with lots of other films in the early days, are the real movies we're speaking here...<br />Now, back to the film. You can notice that not all of this movie takes place on Christmas. It's good to see year round. The opening sequence is, of course, when George Bailey (ha, got his name) was a boy, and he saves Harry from drowning to death in frigid waters. Then he attends the graduation dance (I'm sure some of you teens and young adults as well as people of all ages will never forget that night.) He falls in love with a girl named Mary, they get married, (I warn you, don't try some of the antics he does.) and George becomes a banker. His business runs short on money and he tries all he can to get it booming again, with a few obstacles along the way. On account of a guardian angel, George gets to see what the town would be like without him (Hey man, why wish that in the first place?  NEVER feel discouraged.)  But it all comes to a happy ending, with the full company on screen.<br />Try this classic for yourself.
6300214540|5.0|One of the better films that came out of the 80's. It's not about a rouge pilot. It's about knowing your limits at being the best.
B00003CXA4|3.0|There is nothing wrong with the quality of this DVD production but the content has made me give it only a 3Star Rating.<br />I waited a long time for this movie to comeout on DVD, I bought my DVD Player in November of 1998. expecting to get this plus few other movies fairly soon. Finally I got my Gandhi DVD but...<br />Even though this movie is about a freedom fighter from India and this movies was shot in Hindi/English at the same time. There is no Hindi Track avaiable on this DVD, while you can watch this movie in English, French Spanis with subtitiles in all three formentioned languages, plus Portugese, Chinese, Korean and Thai languages.<br />Again missed the Hindi?<br />I wrote a letter to Mr. (Sir in England) Attenborough in this regard but no reply from either him or people who read his fan mail.<br />How sad a Director which made so much money and fame from this Movie about an Indian Hero, forgot to add the native language of india as an option.<br />Peace
B00005UKKF|5.0|This video is among the best video that Britney has put out thus far. Great footage, great performances. I must admit Britney is looking mighty fine in this one.
B000002UAR|3.0|Believe it or not, the Beatles were not as godly as we make them out to be. Good as a team, they were not great. They have aged and so have their albums. Techniques and styles that were revolutionary in the 60's are dated today. The vague attempt at music concrete'/ electronic music on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" pales in comparison to works by masters like Can or John Cage. Rhythms are simplistic and melodies depend on repetition. \\"Taxman\\" sounds like a re-worked version of the \\"Batman\\" television show theme song, and the guitar on it is not impressive. The sitar is very chintzy on other tracks. <BR>    By the way, The Yardbirds first flirted with the sitar, as Page and Clapton--who did many of the early Harrison guitar solos-- first discovered fuzz and wah-wah. George Martin did keyboard work for the group, and  many more of the Beatles ideas were not their own. \\"Love You To\\" has lyrics that can be found in Eastern philosophy books. The rest of the album is syrupy goop or wannabe psychedelia that would be precluded within years of this album's arrival. There is much more to unload on the Beatles. But who is this iconoclast to stand against four aged men from Liverpool?
B000007T1M|5.0|Any way you slice it, System of a Down is a great metal band. Short, loud songs that are to the point assure you that you will not get tired of this album. Serj, much like Mike Patton, treats his voice like an instument rather than something that just screetches over the music. People have lumped these guys in with the \\"nu-metal\\" crowd, but I don't agree with them. System have got alot more to offer than the nu metal clones: a refreshing sound and very off center politcal lyrics. I recommend this CD to any fan of metal. A+
B00005JKHP|5.0|I have always liked Star Trek TMP,now I love it.<BR>The film really looks great on DVD,and the newly remastered sound in Dolby 5.1 is wonderful.As for the movie itself,it is better than ever in my opinion,really tightened up.Certain scenes from the 1979 theatrical/1983 TV versions of the film have been trimmed,others removed.<BR>Some of the special effects have been digitally redone.They are wonderful and blend in seamlessly with the original effects.<BR>Even the opening/closing credits have been redone and look better!<br />As far as special features go,there is a feature length commentary which I haven't listened to yet.However I did view the film with the text commentary by Michael Okuda(co-author of the Star Trek Encyclopedia),and found it absolutely fascinating.I wish more DVDs had a feature like that!<BR>On the second disc there are three documentaries,as well as trailers/TV spots,deleted/trimmed scenes,etc.<BR>The deleted scenes are very interesting to watch.They are broken down into two sections-1979 theatrical and 1983 TV.Included are the orginal versions of scenes that have been digitally altered for the Director's Version.<br />Overall a great DVD package which most fans should love.<BR>Hat's off to director Robert Wise and Paramount!
B00004XQ83|5.0|Why don't people write music like this anymore?  The songs have a great, old-timey sound and the lyrics are uplifting.  A few of the songs I had heard of before, like &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; from books like &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;, but had never actually heard them, so that was a treat.  That song in particular has really funny, whimsical lyrics if you take the time to pay attention.  &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; is the real reason I bought the album in the first place.  After seeing the movie, I immediately got that addictive song in my head and had to buy the album, although I was not really familiar with the rest of the songs.  I was not disappointed, however.  The whole album has a lot of great music, which, even though you may not have been from that generation will still make you think of church picnics, barbecues, and long southern summers from another age.
B000002C2E|4.0|Time out of mind is a remarkable album from a remarkable songwriter.  Dylan has produced some of his most fantastic work on this album and it is his best work since the sixties.  Love sick is as good a song as he has ever recorded whilst Dirt road blues is far supieror to much of his &quot;overrated&quot; work in the mid sixties.  Indeed the album is packed with great songs from the darkness of Not dark yet to the retro sounding standing in the doorway.  However nothings perfect and the tendencey to drag tracks out , plus the lack of quality displayed in tracks such as make you feel my love and million miles prevent this from being a great album.<br />Dylan returns then,with a good album to prove firstly that theres life in the old dog yet and secondly to suggest that his revelvence will continue well into the next century
B00005N83O|4.0|Hey,<BR>I think J. Lo is the one of the coolest singers out there.  Her voice may not match up to Alicia Keys and Mary J. Blige but she herself is cool.  I'm a guy who listens to J. Lo and think that she's really good my friends don't like her and tease me a bit about it, but when she comes to my city i'm going to her concert.  My fave songs on her album are &quot;I'm Real,&quot; &quot;Ain't That Funny,&quot; and &quot;Play.&quot;  These are all quality songs.  I especially like the songs she does with Ja Rule, I think their voices go together very nicely.  I just wish she would keep the explicatives down to a minimum so I wouldn't have to buy her CDs edited.<BR>Well thats all,<BR>Anonymous
B00000253N|4.0|Before discovering Dylan, I was told to buy 3 albums.  This, The Freewhellin and John Wesely Harding.  Of those three, this was the worst.  <br />Scattered throughout this offering are some of Dylan's best recordings.  Idiot Wind is a touching track whilst Tangled up in Blue and Simple Twist of fate provide an excellent opening.  The acoustic ending of shelter from the storm and buckets of rain can match any of the acoustic offerings recorded previously.  However, these timeless classics which dominate the album are offset by Your a big girl now, an average song at best and Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts, quite possibly the worst Dylan song I have come across.  Meet me in the morning is also far from great and in conjunction with the aforementioned tracks prevent this being a \\"classic\\" album<br />This is a good album and has plenty to offer music fans of all ages.  However, Dylan's best work is not to be found here and for an artist with such a backlog of music, I would recommended John Wesely Harding over this
0684801558|5.0|This is my second reading of Fitzgerald, and I was just as captured by this story as &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.  Anthony and Gloria Patch portray a story of unexpected love, excess, lust, and the many facets of marriage.  Fitzgerald's description is immaculate, something many authors have sought to recreate but rarely match.  The supporting cast of characters in this novel possess as much livelihood as do the Patches.  An honest story, and well worth your time, especially Fitzgerald fans.
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis are the real deal.  No band in the UK matched them at their peak and no band in the UK today can get near them.  Proof of this is contained on Morning Glory.  An album not bettered by anything in the nineties<br />Hello is an upbeat masterpiece opener that sets the popier tone in comparision to definatly maybe.  Roll with it, the weakest link, still sounds so alive and fresh when compared to guitur UK 2002.  Wonderwall is a classic single which yoou think can never be bettered.  Dont look back in anger achieves the seemingly impossible and takes the title of best tune of the nineties...<br />Some might say offers a reminder of their debut and is a rock n roll masterpiece, cast no shadow shows a gentler side to Gallagher whilst pop perfection is created on she's electric.<br />Morning glory offers another taste of why they become the greatest band in the world before the masterpiece of champagne supernova<br />If you do no own this record, buy it now and discover why Oasis become the greatest band to emerge from this country since the beatles
B00005RDRO|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a child and it absolutly terrified me.  The dark setting; the maid who was unable to speak or hear; the murders; these were all so much for a young girl to handle.  However, when I was away at college and since we were unable to afford cable my roommates and I would occasionally buy videos and watch them over and over and over... When I found a copy of Murder By Death for sale I thought of this as an opportunity to overcome the scarring this film had left me with as a child.  We went home and popped the video in the VCR and for the next 94 minutes we laughed until we cried.  I absolutly loved this movie!<br />The casting was excellent!  I couldn't imagine anyone else but those incredibly talented actors/actresses playing the richly developed characters.  The setting was well done and the script is hilarious!!!  By today's standards some of the jokes/lines can be considered to be very politically incorrect and the idea of a caucasian (Sellers)portraying an Asian would probably receive much protest.  But considering the time the film was made this is not an issue for me personally (I'm part Asian). The set is beautiful and yet haunting and the costuming is wonderful.  I dream of having a beautiful dress like the one worn by Dora Charleston (portrayed by the incredibly talented Maggie Smith).<br />I can honestly say that I watch this movie at least once a week and I know this film so well I can almost follow the dialogue line by line when watching it.  I was so happy when it was finally released on DVD and I appreciate all of the little extras found on the DVD but I really would have enjoyed a Dirctor's Commentary to follow along with the movie.  Overall I highly recommend this movie for anyone in need of a very good laugh.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I flew down to Las Vegas with a friend on the weekend of her concert at the MGM Grand and it was awesome!!! Britney is just too hot!! Yeah when it came on T.V. i saw that it was pretty obvious that she was lip synching but the DVD totally fixed it and filled in the low spots of the songs where you saw her moving her mouth but not hearing her voice!! she is a great performer and i enjoyed this show to the fullest!! its a great buy for any britney fan!!
B000051VWW|5.0|What a beautiful CD. Sade's voice is rich and velvety, like coffee with Kahlua and cream. The melodies are spare, the band backing her jazzy, inspired. This is a mature work, with a depth of conscience and feeling. I've listened to it over and over again, loving it each time, feeling touched by the heart and soul poured into the music.
B00004U8H4|5.0|What to say about this movie? I've now seen it upwards of 30 times, and I love it more and more with each viewing. It's really less about a psycho killer as it is satirical look at the &quot;yuppie lifestyle&quot; of the 1980's. As far as actual violence, the movie is way toned down compared to the book.<br />I think the category it best fits into would be a dark comedy. The more you see it, the more you notice every nuance of every character, with Christian Bale's portrail of Patrick Bateman being the undisputed masterpiece of the film. He brings a witty and amusing, yet still scary edge to Bateman. This is one of the best performances I have seen by an actor in a movie.<br />This is definitely a must-see.
6305181810|5.0|This is one of my least favorite Grisham novels.  It's short on plot and a little heavy-handed, and Grisham is not very good with characters.  Coppola, however, is wonderful with characters, and Matt Damon's Rudy Baylor is one of the finest performances he's ever given.  Damon, DeVito, Danes, and Voight all make this an amazing film when it could very easily have been another Pelican Brief.  All the actors are very obviously having fun in their parts.  This movie is heartwarming, funny, and kind, and Damon's gentle voice-over perfectly underscores the genuine feeling that Coppola so deftly engenders.  It's fascinating to watch Damon work here - he plays a soft-spoken Tennessee lawyer with as much assurance as he does a brash Boston mathematician in Good Will Hunting.  Go watch this one.  You'll like it.

B000001C6M|5.0|Kill 'Em All, Bonded by Blood, and Show No Mercy are the best metal debut albums of all time. This was my second Slayer album after RIB and ever since, Slayer has been one of my favorite bands. This is like Appetite for Destruction, in that, it means it was a great album. Pure aggression. Araya's vocals are so good on this one, just listen to those high notes!
B00005NB0H|5.0|Hearing this album again after over 20 years of hiatus brought back so many vivid memories of the friends I had over the years. We were a close knit bunch of snot-nosed high schoolers in the Philippines. We had the opportunity of seeing the vinyl album come out of the shrink wrapping and with nervous hands, my friend Robbie dropped the stylus into the first cut of side A. Our view of music was changed that day. And now, after 30 years, the intensity of those feelings come back as lucid as two guitars crashing to smithereens on stage. To Robbie, Bujim, Pobsie and Larry here it is in its entirety. I thank those who brought the album back inot its current form of the double CD. One can not hear See Me Feel me enough. I just take the long way to drive home and pray for traffic.
0064400018|4.0|The plot of this first book on the series is very interesting and it gives a good picture of what life was in those years for a girl growing up as a pioneer.However Laura Ingalls Wilder's language sounds as it was intended for younger children: lots of repetitions, small kids words... But, maybe, she wanted us to think as she used to think at those times, and she was very small.Anyway, I think that this book should be read by any American and it also should be read by anyone studying AMerican Literature or the Anerican Culture.
B00000G3I2|4.0|This is a truly great movie, every college grad should see.  The retrospective documentary is wonderful.  But the movie trailor is of another movie - Silverado.  Why???  And the legendary &quot;Flashback scene&quot; with Kevin Costner is NOT included with the Deleted Scenes feature.  An unbelievable and disappointing omission.
B00003CXV4|5.0|This is perhaps one of the greatest movies i have ever seen, because it is very sad and its a movie that makes you think about how much life has to offer and how one day everything can slip away. It also brings out the point that death and life comes and goes but love is everlasting.
0792836634|5.0|Most horror movies are filled with gore. For some bizarre reason movie makers seem to think that the bloodier a picture is, the larger the audience will be. However, this really isn't the case. The best horror movies are the ones that don't show much blood and guts; the human imagination can conjure images much more frightening than anything special effects people can come up with. The best horror movies understand this (see the grandmaster of horror and suspense Alfred Hitchcock). CHILD'S PLAY is such a movie.<br /><br />CHILD'S PLAY revolves around a popular child's toy that becomes possessed by the soul of a convicted murderer and thief. In the film's opening sequence, the killer dies in a toy store after being struck by lightning while chanting voodoo over a toy doll that looks remarkably similar to the popular &#34;My Buddy&#34; dolls of the late 1980's. The doll is bought by a desperate single mother from a bum behind the department store where she works. The mother takes the child home to her son and from there the real terror begins.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is fairly believable, after all who hasn't been afraid of some doll or other when they were a kid? However, it suspensefully builds upon that premise from one scene to the next. A show of a toy's hand here and a burst of childlike laughter there is all that is needed to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.<br /><br />However, not only that, but CHILD'S PLAY is a horror film filled with wit and humor. Long before SCREAM &#34;heralded&#34; a new way to make scary movies, there was CHILD'S PLAY. To begin with, there's the previous mention of the obvious play on the once popular My Buddy dolls. However, the film is filled with pop culture references and a play on the horror formula (they always come back at the end). Sometimes these moments are cheesy. However, even the cheesy moments are done in such a way that they are humorous, rather than corny.<br /><br />Overall, a clever scary movie worth watching.e worth watching.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|&quot;It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside...&quot;  If you are an Elton John fan and you like relatively mainstream rock music and your taste in movies does not run along the lines of Armageddon or other movies where the main character's are explosions than you will probably love this movie.  Many scenes are over the top and a little bizarre - but that just makes it more fun to watch.
B000002JSN|5.0|I first heard this album in 1986 when I was in high school.   For about 60 seconds, I thought what in the heck is this junk, then suddenly I was hooked.  That is the affect that Kashmir had on me.   Since 1986, I have probably listened this album 1000s of times.  It never gets old.   As someone else said, this album is like digging up a whole pile of diamonds.   There are a number of songs on this albums that just one of would make a good band great.   <br />Although others may not agree, but I think that In my Time of Dying is one of the best jams ever--it is both throbbing and symphonic--every single 11 minutes.  This masterpiece highlights every single one of members of the band, but somehow Plant's howls and Bonham's hammering drums stand out.<br />I also find this album to be a unique combination of sensuality and just pure jam.  Sick again, Black country woman, and Trampled Underfoot suggest the pull of love and loss of it.<br />By the way, the Complete Led Zeppelin album is highly recommended.  Also Page & Plant's No Quarter album contains an incredible extended version of Kashmir.   I would buy the album for only that song, if nothing else.<br />If there is any classic rock album one should have, this it.<br />Period.  Hands Down.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|When I first heard about this film, I was both excited and apprehensive. While I was certain that Angelina Jolie was a great choice for protraying famed videogame character Lara Croft, I was worried that the game's look and feel would not be translated correctly onscreen.<br />Sadly after watching the movie I was proved right on both accounts. Angelina Jolie nails the part of Lara Croft perfectly, even down to her faux British accent, and is perfectly fit and just enough of a badass to make her believable.<br />That unfortunately is where the fun of this movie ends. Sure, there are the requisite beautiful locations, such as fabled Angkor Wat and Iceland, but what happens between beautifully-shot scenery is a bit of a mish-mash.<br />The plot is largely ignored for the sake of some good action sequences, most notably the bungee attack. There's something about an all-powerful triangle (triangle?!) that the secret society Illuminati wants, and Lara has to find it. Or what? Oh yeah, the bad guys will get it.<br />The DVD is perhaps worth a rental; it 's chock-full of extras, including deleted scenes, a U2 video, Alternate main title sequence, and various featurettes on special effects, stuntwork, and Angelina's intense physical training for the film. There's also an easter egg and some ok DVD-ROM material.<br />Unfortunately while Tomb Raider looks great and has a pretty good soundtrack and some nice action sequences, the whole film feels rushed and just simply pasted together. Let's hope that if there is to be a sequel that more time will be spent on storytelling and less on blowing stuff up.
B000056JYB|4.0|The first disc has the original Blind Faith album from 1969,<BR>plus 5 new tracks. The second disc is basically all <BR>instrumentals that is basically blues-influenced rock.<BR>The songs are good, but I feel sometimes the tracks<BR>could be shortened a bit, and be just as effective if<BR>not moreso. This is especially applicable to the <BR>instrumental tracks. <BR>  Blind Faith emerged from Eric Clapton and Steve <BR>Winwood's desire to work together on a project out of <BR>mutual respect for each other. Both had crossed paths in <BR>the past, but both were too busy with other projects in <BR>other groups. Since Traffic and Cream were basically done <BR>by this time, ex-Cream drummer Ginger Baker decided he <BR>wanted in, so he joined the group. There was also the<BR>possibility of being labeled as a Cream reformation, so<BR>the band recruited another member, namely a bassist.<BR>  Rick Grech of Family left his group to join Blind Faith <BR>as the bassist. Had To Cry Today is nearly 9 minutes, but <BR>I feel it could have been cut down and been better.<BR>  Of course this album isn't for commercial radio. If<BR>you like experimental blues-influenced music with some<BR>soulful singing, then Blind Faith is for you. It's interesting<BR>to also note the controversial album cover (a topless young<BR>girl with a model toy airplane) was met with hostility in<BR>some countries, and the album was released in some countries<BR>with an alternate cover. <BR>  The liner notes are fairly comprehensive. It gives a basic <BR>oral history of the band, and the events that led to the formation of the band.  <BR>  They are called the world's first supergroup by some, but<BR>I beg to differ. I think Cream was a supergroup to some<BR>degree, and so were the Yardbirds. The definition of<BR>&quot;supergroup&quot; is what is being contested.<BR>   If you don't like long blues-influenced instrumentals,<BR>avoid this album. Some have suggested getting the original<BR>Blind Faith album, but if you are a hardcore fan of 1960s<BR>blues-influenced soulful sounding groups, this would be<BR>a must to a collection.
0786867973|5.0|Nigella Lawson has a wonderful writing style.  She is straightforward, while also being reassuring. How can that be?  She is not afraid of substituting canned vegs. or frozen peas, and makes no apologies for using them.  The narrative is entertaining and helpful.  Nigella is the sort of writer and cook who is fun to read. The recipes are wonderful! Yum. Highly recommend this book.  Fairy cupcakes are great, and so is the chocolate pudding cups.
B00005NOOH|5.0|Quite simply the best war documentary ever put together. The narration might be mistaken for cold and unfeeling, but it is intentionally unbiased. It is not about who was right or wrong, who was good or bad, just a stark recounting of the facts, with a wealth of behind the scenes information.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I loved this comedy with Reese Witherspoon.  Elle, the beautiful young sorority sister with everything---style, looks, a handsome, rich boyfriend---only wants one more thing...a ring!  But when her cad of a boyfriend up and leaves her for a continued education in the Ivy League (as well as a more &quot;appropriate&quot; young woman to be his wife), she is devastated.  This young woman is fashion savy but not an air headed bimbo.  With sheer dedication and an undying optimism, Elle follows her beau across country to win him back, leaving behind the sun and beaches of California for the serious world of Harvard.  What I liked about her character is that she is not catty or elitest, though she has money.  She is kind hearted and has a positive attitude even though people look at her as a dim witted party girl.  With some funny supporting roles, this film is full of good fun and more than a few good laughs.  This film shows us what a comedic talent (and overall talent) Reese Witherspoon is.  This dvd is a very good comedy to add to your collection.
B00003CXUM|5.0|Much has been written about the film, so I just wanted to share a thought. A friend of mine, a movie buff, saw it days after it was shown in the US, and emailed me (he knew I had also seen it), \\"I'm so smitten by Maggie Cheung\\". I thought over it for a while and wrote back, \\"I think you are smitten by the idea of being smitten by Maggie Cheung\\". He agreed.
0553270435|2.0|In my country most techniques described in this book has been a common knowledge of spiritualists and martial artists alike, I couldn't find anything new in the book except that the concept was described in more scientific(-like) way.<br />And, one basic thing is missing.<BR>You cannot find the meaning of your life using such techniques. Maybe you can improve your health, wealth, ability etc. etc., but meaningful life comes from something higher (or deeper). I am afraid Dr. Murphy got too excited with the techniques and forget to discuss the foundation.<br />I prefer Steven covey's 'Seven Habits of Highly Effective People'. It covered the very foundation of our life first before moved into techniques.<br />Maybe these two book could make a good pair?
1573222038|5.0|I just finished reading Fingersmith and I want to say that I haven't been this engrossed in a novel in months.  I read mostly historical fiction, at least one book a month.  This is a true page turner with lots of twists and turns.  I could not put it down.  This is not a book for the faint of heart or for someone who wouldn't like reading about the slums of London or about lesbians. If you can get past that, you will love this book. If you want a fast pace and a good story that really comes alive, this is a winner.  Sarah Waters is a master story teller.  I really would like to suggest this book to my historical fiction book club, but most of these ladies would be put off by the sexual overtones.  I thought it was handled with finess and great sensitivity.  I loved it.
B000006TRV|5.0|The melding in The Wall of the dark and sometimes angry lyrical themes and vocals of Roger Waters with the unparalleled guitars of David Gilmore and the occasional orchestral support yield an album that is so unlike anything other that any attempt to categorize it is doomed to failure.<br />Roger Waters has created the ultimate sonic experience for those who, like me, have a dark side to their personality.  Depression at the seeming hopelessness of existence and rage at the masses who strive to impose on those around them a positively sadistic urge to control are Wall themes that find resonance in my personal experience.  I have found at least one other who, like me, is mutliple standard deviations above mean intellegence and who experiences the same reaction to Pink Floyd's music in general, and The Wall specifically, that I do.  I can't help wandering if being a depressive Pink Floyd fan is a common experience for highly intellegent individuals.  I also wonder if less cerebral Pink Floyd fans enjoy the music for a different set of reasons than I do.  However, in the end, I definitely believe this is required listening for anyone who has a depressive side.<br />Incidentally, the effect of listening to the album, at least for myself, is rather the opposite of what might be expected.  I find solace in the fact that somebody else was apparently experiencing some of the same emotions and was able to so effectively communicate them through music.
0451205146|4.0|While Bowden blends personal interviews into narative, the point of Black Hawk Down is the the type of action that America sends its military into in this modern world, the close in gunfight.  I don't care what your views are on the deployment of our military in the post Cold War era, whoever you are, you need to understand the extent and limits of American power.  This is one place to start and probably the best, with the \\"poor bloody infantry.\\"  I don't think of battle as a adventure.  Reading this blow by blow of this ugly action in Somalia can at least make the uninitiated understand that battle is an extreme test of endurance and at best get one out of the mind set that every threat to U.S. interests can be solved by an air stike with a smart bomb.

B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club, based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, is an excellent adaption of his book. There are so many themes, feelings and human sensitivities touched upon it can be a bit overwhelming at first, making it a good film to watch more than once.<br />The violence during the fight scenes were brutal at times and fairly disturbing. But it almost seemed necessary in order to immerse a person into the emotional state it put the character's in. Yet I can see where some of the younger, macho crowd might think it's \\"cool, dude\\" and associate the film's title with the fight scenes alone, making it worth their while...unfortunately.<br />Ultimately Fight Club grows on you and creates sympathy for the characters in the film, moving you to cheer them on inside. Pitt and Norton were great choices for the cast leads.<br />It's an interesting and thought provoking story, something you don't see much in film today honestly. It questions our values, family structures, religions, and touches our inner-demons.<br />Death is a major part of the story, dealing with it, accepting it, and of course the waiters, clerks, cubicle slaves, security guards, beat cops and other servants of the rich find some meaning in life, something to look forward to and be proud of, outside of their dull, redundant, consuming, sitcom-watching lives, in a most bizarre fashion.<br />The film has a little of everything; comedy, tragedy, drama, and suspense. If you are going to watch a film made in the last 3 years, watch Fight Club, highly recommended. There's simply too much to talk about in a simple review here, and most of it has been said already, but I wanted to give the film, and the story, it's props.
0060506989|5.0|The North Vietnamese soldier that Colonel Harold Moore's men captured in the Central Highlands of Vietnam on November 14, 1965 delivered chilling news: \\"There are three battalions [of Vietcong] on the mountain who very much want to kill Americans but have not been able to find any.\\" A few hours later, those Vietnamese made contact with the 7th Cavalry --- and thus began the first battle of the Vietnam War to pit Americans directly against the Vietcong.<br />The killing began right away. Not the killing of Vietnamese. The killing of Americans. Five died in the first few minutes. The hills were a concert of screams and explosions. Hiding behind a termite hill, Moore thought of another man who'd led the 7th Cavalry: George Armstrong Custer. Moore promised himself that he wouldn't let this battle --- Ia Drang --- repeat the sorry history of Little Bighorn.<br />We Were Soldiers Once...and Young is the story of how close Moore and his men came to being slaughtered like Custer's troops. The numbers are spine-chilling: In four days of fighting --- with the enemy sometimes as close as 75 feet to the American line --- 234 Americans died. In this remarkable minute-by-minute account, you get to meet these men. And more: You watch each soldier die. And you get to grieve for every single one.<br />The book's real subject isn't war. It's leadership. Consider the situation. Americans had been advisers in Vietnam, but they had never really engaged the enemy. Moore was career Army: West Point, Korea, advanced studies in fast-moving, guerilla warfare. In June of l965, he began training his battalion for combat in Vietnam. In August, the Army pulled all six of his newly-acquired second lieutenants out. In August, any soldiers who had 60 days or less to serve were separated from the 7th Cavalry. So when Moore and his unit sailed to Vietnam, they had already lost 100 of their most experienced men.<br />The difference between an under-trained unit that survives a fierce battle and one that becomes legendary in defeat is leadership. Listen to some of the ways Moore managed his troops. He told his men:<br />--- \\"Only first-place trophies will be displayed, accepted or presented in this battalion. Second place in our line of work is defeat of the unit on the battlefield, and death for the individual in combat.\\"<br />--- \\"Decision-making will be decentralized: Push the power down. It pays off in wartime.\\"<br />--- \\"Loyalty flows down as well.\\"<br />--- \\"I check up on everything. I am available day or night to talk to any officer of this battalion.\\"<br />Or this: Before the battle started, James Galloway (a United Press reporter who became co-author of Moore's book 25 years later) was watching Moore's soldiers shave as he boiled water for coffee one morning before the battle. Moore passed by. \\"We all shave in my outfit --- reporters included,\\" he snapped. Galloway immediately repurposed his coffee water for shaving.<br />And, finally, this: \\"In the American Civil War, it was a matter of principle that a good officer rode his horse as little as possible. There were sound reasons for this. If you are riding and your soldiers are marching, how can you judge how tired they are, how thirsty, how heavy their packs weigh on their shoulders?\\"<br />Moore applied this philosophy conscientiously. He flew in to Ia Drang on the first helicopter. He led his men from the front. When he saw men from another company beginning to haul one of his dead soldiers out of a foxhole with a harness, he snapped, \\"No you won't do that. He's one of my troopers and you will show some respect. Get two more men and carry him to the landing zone.\\" When it was over and it was time for Moore to turn over command, he requested a full battalion formation. One soldier recalls, \\"We stood in formation, with some units hardly having enough men to form up. Colonel Moore spoke to us and he cried.

B00004U8P9|5.0|or a Nighties tale!<br />Where HAVE you been if you haven't seen this fabled work?  Panned and dished by critics initially [although the stage play drew 'em in night after night, but that's a hearse of another flavor]- this \\"ultra-shriek\\" excursion into the forbidden world of a cross-dressing, aliens [local and imported], virgins, yeah somewhat, of various 'persuasions', musclemen, bikers, and just plain old Home-grown freaks!<br />Well worth seeing !  With a cast headed by TIM CURRY, SUSAN SARANDON, BARRY BOSTWICK - how can you go wrong?<br />Nice counterpart?  \\"Phantom of the Paradise\\"!<br />AND - there is even a sequel!  \\"Shock Treatment\\".  Both by the Great Richard O'Brien.
B00005QIPH|4.0|This is a very solid effort. Maybe the fact that it hasn't been so hyped over here in the States is why I was curious to see what the big noise over Britain was all about. I went into this with no expectations, maybe even lower expectations (my indie mind said that if the buzz was that loud, it can't be that good. So I'm a music snob, sue me). I really surprised myself by liking it... a lot. And don't get me wrong, they haven't re-invented the wheel here; what they've done is taken a bunch of motifs we've all heard before, chewed them up, and spit it all back at us into this really great, retro-sounding modern rock mixture. I say modern rock and not the dreaded word &quot;alternative&quot; because that's what we called it back in the '80s, back before it became a fad, back when it was still underground. What we have here, folks, is a solid first effort. It might disappoint you on first listen (I found myself asking the CD's title question through the first listen), but given a few more listens, you'll find yourself strangely drawn to it and attracted to it. It consistently satisfies.<br />Oh, one more thing: BUY THE UK VERSION!! I have not heard the US substitution track &quot;When It Started&quot; that replaced the UK version's &quot;NYC Cops&quot;, but the track crackles with energy, fits in perfectly with the rest of the album, and really shouldn't be that offensive to NYC's finest, especially if you take it in the spirit of a snotty young man. I do think it's classy that the Strokes decided to try to avoid offense after 9/11, but truth be told, it isn't that offensive of a song.<br />All in all, a very solid debut. 3 1/2 stars.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|One might be tempted to dismiss the premise and structure of this film as a gimmick--but what a gimmick!  And so well done!  Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) has lost the ability to form new long-term memories, but that doesn't stop him from going after the man responsible for both his condition and a brutal attack on his wife.  The story unfolds in reverse so that the viewer is able to share Leonard's dilemma; he constantly finds himself in situations that he does not understand with no idea of what preceded.  It is fascinating to see the events leading to scenes that we have already witnessed.  It all culminates in a shattering revelation which Leonard, unfortunately, is doomed to forget...<br />Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss deliver excellent supporting performances.

6303269869|5.0|I am 16 years old and female and initially I got this movie to watch because Andy Garcia is in it...I'm a HUGE fan.  Once I started getting into the movie however, it really blew me away.  This movie makes one realize the power of alcohol and how difficult it is to stop, even though you know what it is doing to yourself and others around you.  This film really made me think and realize how truly grateful I should be about my own life.<br />Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia play a wonderful couple in this movie but I must say that I was most impressed with Garcia's role as Michael.  He is a VERY versatile and extremely talented actor that makes any role appear to be himself.  His portrayal of pain, dedication, and frustration are incredible.  Even in his shortcomings, he is able to play them out admittedly instead of trying to be proud and try and hide them.  I was truly touched.
B00005RZV4|4.0|There's nothing like the intensity of a NIN concert, so this was an eagerly awaited recording. And while it's a very good album, it's worth noting that's it's not entirely live. And I don't mean the pre-programmed electronica. After watching the DVD, and I presume this album is the soundtrack of the show, it's apparent that certain elements were enhanced. There are moments when Trent Rezonor's singing doesn't sync up to what he's saying on the mic, or visually watching the sound of a cymbal crash when you can see the drummer not hitting a cymbal. Was this pre-recorded? Was it sweetened in post production? (I caught Talking Heads doing the same thing in Stop Making Sense). If you can overlook these faux-pas, then this makes for a 70 minutes that's hardly dull. PS: I do hate the abrubt start and end of the album, but that's NIN doing what they do best, making you feel uncomfortable.
B00005TT77|5.0|This is very likely the best soundtrack or best CD period, that I have ever listened to.  What could be better than current, talented musicians singing their own interpretation of Beatles' songs, such as &quot;Golden Slumber&quot;(sung by Ben Folds), &quot;Blackbird&quot;,(sung by Sarah McLachlan), and &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;(sung by Eddie Vedder).  This CD absolutely amazes me every time I listen to it again and again and again....
0679423001|5.0|Never before has a novel affected me in so many different ways over so long a time. The older I get, the more brilliant it becomes. It's about love and innocence and innocence lost and tragic dysfunction. In other words, absolutely real life, regardless of its period. I've never come across such profound use of language as his is in presenting this story as art on the page. Now, I'm in my mid-thirties and as each period of time goes by in my life and I re-read this again, another truth is realized within it. It's magically romantic, and as most love is, it is also sorrowfully tragic as demons hatch out of previously enchanting objects, and desires shift, and hearts tire from being so long malnourished. You'll be right there at Oxford from the moment the characters begin their journey, so if you're someone who loves to get lost in a novel, go go go, but understand that you'll pay for the highs of innocence with the lows of inevitable life experience. You're only really young and in love for so long before life takes over to settle you down for good. How you cope with that reality is the measure of your character after all is said and done. But who of us doesn't look back and delight in our innocence and the true love we felt in our youth? You'll find that place in this novel and enjoy yourself within it. I fall in love again every time i read it!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I am surprised by how this mediocre \\"art\\" was able to deceive so many people. What a shame!  It should be an example of bad taste for young filmmakers...
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Originally, when this movie first came out, I had no interest whatsoever in seeing it. But one day at the video store there was NOTHING to rent, so I gave it a try, and watched it on my iBook with my headphones, and OHMYGOD, it was fantastic! I was soooo wrong about my expectations of it. I'm usually not a big fan of covertunes either, but this production made me now have to own the DVD for myself. You're not overwhelmed by the fantasy of it all, it's actually very accessible to this world that we live in now. I'm not even a big fan of Ewan, but again, his innocence in romantic love made me love him in this role. What a beautiful voice he has also. I admit that when I received the CD for XMas, I took it back to the record store for something else, and now I'm so sorry I did because now I've got to go buy it back! Give it a chance if you're unsure about it, you may just be surprised at how much you LOVE it!
0451160916|5.0|The Shining is a great book that is hard to put down once you start.  The story begins when Jack Torrance gets the care-taking job at the Overlook Hotel during the winter months when the hotel is closed.  Jack is married to a girl named Wendy and they have a son, Danny.  Jack has had a rough past.  He lost his teaching job for beating up a student and another time he broke his sons arm after coming home drunk.  He was a real hard drinker but has been dry since the incident with Danny's arm.  <br />Danny possesses a power called a shine, where he knows what people are thinking and can see things other people can't.  Danny meets Dick Hollorann, the hotels cook, who also has the shine.  Dick tells Danny things about having the shine and warns him about places to stay away from in the hotel.  The Overlook Hotel has a history of bad things happening, and most of those things have left evil effects behind.  For example, one of the previous caretakers, Delbert Grady, killed his family and then himself while caring for the hotel.  Dick tells Danny that if he ever needs help, to shine him a message and he'll come as soon as possible. <BR>After Jack, Wendy, and Danny have been at the hotel by themselves for a couple of months, the hotel's evil forces go after Jack.  They had been after Danny from the beginning, but Danny was too strong to let them get him.  They eventually get to Jack and give him liquor to get him drunk.  When Jack gets drunk, he has a very short temper and goes crazy.  Delbert Grady, the former \\"psycho\\" caretaker, begins to talk Jack into killing Wendy and Danny.  Jack listens to every word Delbert says and then begins to try to kill his family.  The hotel has Jack under such a trance that it's not really Jack acting insane, it's the evil of the hotel in him.  While Jack is under this trance, he forgets to check the boiler.  Jack had been checking the boiler every day to make sure that it was okay.  Danny and Wendy are trying to get away from Jack and savethemselves.  Tony, Danny's imaginary friend, tells Danny to remember what Jack has forgotten.  Danny remembers that Jack didn't check the boiler that day and therefore it will blow up.   This ends up saving Danny and his mom's life. <BR>The theme of this book is that evil can be found in things or people that you think are good.  Jack thought that the hotel would be a great place to stay.  He also thought that beer was good and yet it also messed up his life.  I liked the characters a lot.  Stephen King did a great job of getting deep into their minds.  He took the time to make sure that you knew and understood each one of them.  His descriptions of the characters were so vivid that it was easy to picture in your mind how each one looked.  Dick was my favorite character in the book because he was such a funny guy and was very thoughtful.  Wendy was an inspirational character.  She was strong and loving and would do anything to keep her son safe. All the characters were well written and interesting.  <BR>There was nothing I disliked about this book.  I would read it ten more times if I had the time.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes thriller and horror type books.
B000001G50|4.0|The track selection for this CD reads like a &quot;greatest hits of soothing classical music&quot;, but don't be fooled by that, this is Herbert von Karajan at his most vigorous and emotional. The mere fact that he could still infuse so much vitality and inventiveness into such well known and often recorded pieces is solid proof of his immense talent. After a rather contrived rendition of Albinoni's Adagio the CD really picks up with a wonderful version of Vivaldi's La Notte, but the real treats are Bach's Air from the Orchestral Suite No. 3 and Gluck's Dance of the Blessed Spirits from Orfeo ed Euridice, both perfectly conducted and sublimely played by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Also included are Pachelbel's Canon and Guige (in a refreshingly powerful version) and Mozart's Serenata Notturna. This is a brilliant CD, and I would recommend both to those new to classical music who are seeking a great introduction to these fabulous pieces, and to those who are familiar with other versions of these works and are looking for different, more vigorous ways of presenting them.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This film appears to have attracted extreme reactions, with each end of the scale oblivious to the pleasure/pain experienced by the other. I know people love it but, and here I have to justify my rating, this is one of the most pretentious, half-baked, ill conceived and grating pieces of cinema I have ever seen. It is shot in permanent half dark, gives little or no insight into Paris of the period and is more amused with itself than its audience ever will be. Reviewers often stress their annoyance at having no \\"no star\\" option. No stars does not go far enough for this disaster.
B00003CX5P|5.0|It's Star Wars, what can I say? It's an astounding stepping stone for an incredible story. This was just the setup the pay off is coming. It changes Star Wars forever in the best possible way. Highest recommendation to those not caught up in how they think Star Wars should be.
0525946284|4.0|Okay, so Ken Follett's \\"Jackdaws\\"borrows its basic plot concept from \\"The Dirty Dozen - a motley group of saboteurs is hastily assembled and trained for a perilous mission behind German lines in France in the few days before the D-Day invasion. Their objective, to destroy a vital Nazi communication center. If the target can be eliminated, the German's ability to coordinate a military response to the massive invasion will be fatally impaired, thereby assuring its success.   The novel opens with an ill-fated attempt, doomed by faulty intelligence,  against the installation by combined French resistance forces and their British commandos. Most of the rebels are killed, and the few that survive are brutally tortured by the Gestapo into divulging secrets that the Nazis hope will break the back of the insurgents.  Among the survivors are the novel's heroine, Felicity Flick, a major in the British commando forces, and her husband Michel, leader of the French resistance cell.   Leaving her wounded husband behind with a young woman from the resistance (whom Flick soon discovers her husband has been having an affair with), she returns to England, and quickly concocts a desperate scheme to have another go at destroying the communications center. She will quickly recruit and train five women who, after being air-dropped into France,  will pose as cleaning women in order to gain access to, and sabotage the targeted chateau. Their code-name:Jackdaws.   From this premise follows a taut,engrossing page-turner as anabsorbing game of cat-and-mouse plays out between Flick's group and her nemesis, Dieter Franck, special adjutant to Gen. Rommel, entrusted with the task of thwarting and eliminating the resistance fighters' efforts to stymie the Nazi's invasion response.  To Follett's credit, he is for the most part successful in giving his characters human dimension where lesser writers would have been satisfied to present us with stock-and stick characters.The Nazi Franck is reasonablyhumane and not totally unsympathetic, while our heroine Flick, while courageous and admirable is often willful, peremptory and downright cold-blooded.   In addition, along with desperately striving to stay one step ahead of her adversary's wiliness, Flick must contend with her group's vagaries and quirks: one is a transvestite, a second is a lesbian who is involved with a third, and yet a fourth is a pampered aristocrat who endangers the group with her inability to keep a secret.   Flick herself must cope with the fact that she no longer loves her faithless husband and is falling for an American officer who is helping coordinate the operation.  Follett, for most of the novel's length maintains a high level of reader suspense and keeps us turning those pages. Unfortunately, what keeps \\"Jackdaws\\" from being a total success is that toward the end, he descends into predictable action cliches, and many of the principals are transformed from the flesh and blood characters they had been heretofore, into cartoonish caricatures -most notably Flick's resemblance to Sigourney Weaver's Rambolina Ripley of the \\"Aliens\\" films.  Nonetheless, \\"Jackdaws\\" is for the most part, an engrossing, suspenseful. and exciting read, more than well-worth the time.

B00005AQGJ|5.0|I know its a far out claim to call it the greatest album ever, but thats how I feel for a few reasons, any one of which alone would make this an amazing album. <br />Firstly, the production is the best Ive heard on any album - rap or not. The beats are raw when needed (Life of an Outlaw), and yet can be touching (Hold ya head is a good example, and one of my favourite tracks ever). To qualify the production, it'd be safe to say its better than anything DJ Premier's ever done and Dre has never come close to tracks like Bomb First and Against All Odds. <br />Asides from the melody of the beats, this album was produced very - read VERY - thoroughly. I didn't know that there was a remastered version out, but now that I do, you can bet Im buying that too, if only for the slightly improved sound quality. Each track fades into the next as if the whole album was done live, with sound effects (like the car starting on against all odds) that make you think you're there with Tupac, just before he was shot. <br />Lyrically, this is Pac at his best too. He goes all sentimental when the soft strings on Hold Ya Head require it, but also shows his venomous side when the memories of beating shot and slightly-out-of-key piano loops on Bomb First get him vexed. Aside from the stunning beats and lyrics, the 7 Day Theory also offers something unique in a sea of mediocre rap albums: it was made just before Tupac was shot dead in Vegas in September of 1996. It was also released less than two months later amidst conspiracy theories and speculation that he was alive, hiding somewhere. Then the autopsy photos came, and as time passed it became more and more obvious that the greatest of all time wasn't coming back. Five years on from his death, it still hasn't been touched. Trust me. You need this. Now.
0471381985|2.0|The back cover of this book modestly proclaims that Mr. Greenwald is the \\"guru of Wall Street's gurus\\". I don't know what kind of gurus there are on Wall Street but if Mr. Greenwald is their mentor then I really feel sorry for them.<BR>The very next day after I finished reading 'Value Investing' I attended a presentation, sponsored by NYSSA's Private Wealth Management Committee, where the author (editor?) presented the book. The presentation confirmed my first impressions: Not only is Mr. Greenwald confused about what Value Investing is but he doesn't seem to understand some fundamental concepts in Finance. For example, he claims that Compaq's major problem stems from the fact that the company put Alta Vista at market value on the balance sheet and then they had to write it off. Hasn't Mr. Greenwald heard about sunk costs? Investing in Alta Vista may have been a poor decision that destroyed shareholders' value but it is something that pertains to the past. It is not something that will continue to influence the firm's operating results in the future.<BR>Greenwald claims that using asset valuation based on reproduction costs provides more accurate estimate of what the company might be worth then using NPV. According to him, NPV is too difficult to estimate and therefore is almost useless. I agree that NPV is difficult to estimate but if it was easy then everyone could be rich, right? In order to do better an individual investor must have a competitive advantage. Competitive advantage is something that one can do but the competition cannot. If balance sheet reading is easier than future cash flow forecasting then more investors should be able to do the former rather than the later. But if many people can do it then it does not give any competitive advantage. Those lucky few who have the exceptional ability to forecast future cash flows will have the competitive advantage and they will be the ones who will make billions of dollars. If Warren Buffet could not do something that is difficult for others then he wouldn't be so rich. The fact that NPV is difficult to estimate does not make it useless. On contrary, the difficulty makes it even more valuable because it gives competitive advantage to those who have the rare gift to see farther than the average individual.<BR>The author claims that markets are not efficient but his idea of market inefficiency is very peculiar. According to him, for example, there cannot be any value in K-Mart because if there were any value in that stock then the horde of analyst, who follow the company, would have discovered it by now. I am not familiar with K-Mart but the statement he made sounds familiar to what the proponents of Efficient Market Hypothesis keep telling: markets are efficient because thousands of bright analysts are working day and night to uncover hidden value. If one can't find value because analysts have already dug out everything there is to know then what makes markets inefficient? Selling stocks to buy Christmas gifts? This can hardly be enough.<BR>The authors do make some good points but overall the book is bad.

B0000024SI|5.0|Well, ok, most people already know a lot about this album, but I want to add my thoughts...first off, the songs on this album are incredible. This is probably the bluesiest album of Dylan's, except for World Gone Wrong, and that's definitely a good thing. The attitude here is very different from Blonde on Blonde, for example; the energy level is generally high here (though some great slow songs are mixed in too, like It Takes a Lot to Laugh, Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues, etc.) This is the best group of musicians Dylan ever played with. Really my only complaint is that the mix makes it kind of hard to differentiate between the instruments; Bloomfield's guitar usually isn't loud enough (a travesty - he's incredible and when audible here is in top form), the piano (Bobby Gregg or something?) is clunky, and the drums are kind of muffled. Dylan's voice and harp are really the only separable sounds. I don't know, maybe that's for the better, but when they finally remaster this I hope I can here Bloomfield.
B00005O5CM|5.0|&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; was one of the funniest movies of 2001. It is the story of Elle Woods and how she goes to Harvard Law School so she could get back together with her boyfriend. Beyond this, she ends up being there for a much better reason. (To find that out just watch the movie.)<BR>  <BR>  Now let me go over the plot a little more. Elle Woods gets dumped by her boyfriend because he thinks that he needs a better girlfriend (to become a wife) if he is going to be a great senator. When she's dumped she decides that she must become a lawyer to get him back. After vigorous work to get into Harvard Law, she gets in and things take a turn for the worst. <BR> <BR> Actress Reese Witherspoon basically makes the movie what it is. This beautiful, talented woman puts on a show that you won't forget. She truly plays the role of what many people would call an everyday blonde. She talks like a rich girl, acts like one, etcetera. <br />  This movie reveals that blondes are not &quot;dumb&quot; and that they really are smart humans capable of doing what any other human with any other color hair can do. <br />  The setting of Harvard University is great and the students and faculty chosen for the roles are great. Many actors that have already been in other popular movies reappear here for a light role.<br />  I recommend &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; to anybody that wants to enjoy a funny movie with a good plot. Whether you are a blonde or not, this movie is a must. It reveals what a blonde female really is on the inside.
0671027344|5.0|I just now finished reading Stephen Chbosky's first novel The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, and to be straight to the point and very frank I loved it! I recomended it to quite a few of my friends. <BR>   Chbosky's writing style is very applauling to me due to the fact that I read mostly assigned books recently. This is because of the advanced level of my classes I had little to no time for a \\"pleasure read.\\" <BR>  A very good friend of mine recomended this book to me because of the way the characters are shown. I personally could relate at one time or another to each and every one of the characters in this book. Chbosky's characters are very round and realistic.<BR>  I'm very picky with my reading material; and the books I have been recently reading haven't interested me for the most part. However, this is a book I really did enjoy reading. It made me realize exactly how much I missed reading a good book. Anyway I would completly recomend this book to almost anyone. But I suppose it kind of depends on the person. But I enjoyed it very much!
0446608955|5.0|I had my doubts, but A Walk to Remember was the best book I've ever read.  I was afraid it would be another stupid teen book.  But this one was different.  It touched the truth in life and went places no book has before.  It examined the true meaning of life and gave strong insights on the way teens like myself should live and deal with tragedy.
0060934913|5.0|KC is a both a personal memoir and an insider's view of the restaurant kitchen. It is a great read. The author delights in shocking us, I think, but the language does ring true.  I suspect the he has grown-up rather a lot since the book was finished.  His life, once on-the-edge, has doubtless moved away from the fringe.  I wonder if he'll look back on the book in ten years and wince a little.
B00005JKQX|5.0|My husband and I both loved this movie!  It has humor, unexpected twists and turns, heart-wrenching empathy, etc. It educates you a bit about schitzophrenia, and is an encouragement to loving bravely.  If you liked \\"Sixth Sense,\\" I think you will love this even more because it is true. (hint: the book, however, is a difficult read, more like a scientific documentary covering the genious albeit immature minds of many math and economic geniouses, what Princeton is really like, and all of his steps to winning the Nobel.  It rather skips over a lot of the personal story covered in this movie.)
B00005U2LM|4.0|Best beats I've heard from the Wu...but lyrically it's not.  In The Hood is a great intro, especially Street Life's part, though there's no doubting the illness of Inspectah Deck, SL's \\"In The Hood!\\" concept is really memorable:<BR>\\"The ones you love will fill you with slugs in the hood<BR>Babies born addicted to drugs in the hood<BR>We amke life or death decisions and the school system is like a minimal prison<BR>So you can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm living in the hood\\".  Method Man's the best on Rules.  The album ends well with Iron Flag(especially INS again) and Dashing.  Only tracks that leave me cold are Soul Power and \\"Good Thing We Brought The Glock\\".  Chrome Wheels isn't all that either.  But overall the album's well within thumbs-up territory.
B00005IC2H|5.0|It's weird because you have no idea what their saying.  It makes you feel odd singing along as well.  But this cd is probably one of the best I've bought in the past three years.  The dynamics and the ambient beauty make even the worst of days seem to melt away.  Probably the best thing Iceland has given the world since a spritely lass named Bjork.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This soundtrack is directly responsible for me seeing this movie again and again.  Everytime I listen to it, I want to go see the movie again.  Tracks 2, 10, 17 and 18 are especially good.  <br />I can't think of a soundtrack that has moved me more.  If you liked the movie, its a sure bet that you will love the soundtrack.
B00003CXUM|3.0|Tony Leung (as Mr. Chow) has never brooded better, Maggie Cheung (as Mrs. Chan) never more the solitary and quirky female we are so fond of seeing in a Wong Kar Wai film... unfortunately, it's all let down by a plot that's wafer-thin!  Amazon.com's in-house reviewer (Jeff Shannon) has basically spelt out the entire story in two sentences.  Yes, the cinematography is immaculate but so mannered with its scenes of curling smoke, rain falling on pavement, of significant glances exchanged that it also leaves the central characters sadly unengaging.  MOOD and POSE alone does not a great film make.  For a truly great film by this director, get \\"Happy Together\\".
B00003CX5P|1.0|I VIEWED THIS DVD RECENTLY, AND WHILE THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE SPECTACULAR THIS JUST DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME APPEAL AS THE PREVIOUS STAR WARS MOVIES. I FOUND THAT I COULD NOT RELATE TO ANY OF THE CHARACTERS (PERHAPS BETTER CASTING COULD HAVE SOLVED THIS). THERE ARE (I'M QUITE SURE) CUTE CHILD ACTORS OUT THERE WHO CAN TRULY ACT. THE CHILD ACTOR IN THIS MOVIE DID NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF TALENT.  MY FAMILY AND I FOUND THE ANIMATED CHARACTER JAR JAR BINKS SO ANOYING WE ALMOST STOPPED WATCHING HALF WAY THROUGH THE FILM.  THIS CHARACTER WAS NOT CUTE OR FUNNY, HAD WAY TO MUCH SCREEN TIME, AND WE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MOST OF HIS LINES.  IF GEORGE LUCAS MAKES ANOTHER EPISODE WE WILL MAKE SURE NOT TO SEE IT.  I GAVE IT ONE STAR DUE TO THE GREAT EFFECTS.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND, UNLESS YOU'RE A DIE HARD STAR WARS JUNKIE.
0316776963|5.0|I am in highschool, and after an essay I wrote a teacher said i had the same writing style as David Sedaris.  After browsing for hours in a bookstore(like I do every weekend), I came across the book.  The title page was enough to bring me in.  I had no idea what the book would be about, but i absolutly had to read it.<BR>I was suprised at how funny it was.  I started passing around the book showing my friends.  Some of his characters even reminded me of my friends.  I think overall the favorite chapter was, \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster\\".  The way he portrays his brother is hilarious.<BR>Dont be suprised if your absolutly drawn in by this book.  Highschoolers love it, my teacher recommends it, and even my parents got laughs out of it.  The book is so painstakingly true to life, anyone can relate.<BR>I think my teacher gave me the best compliment anyone ever could.  David Sedaris is one of the best writers out there.  We read a couple chapters over lunch- I wouldnt advise that unless you have got some napkins handy.
B00004W50Z|5.0|The band never ceases to amaze. With Danko and Manuel's high,ovepronciating vocals, Robertson's folkish yet funkish guitar playing and Hudsons unique organ playing, this album stands out among others in its time. When you hear songs like The Rumor, Stage Fright, Daniel and the Sacred Harp, Time to Kill, and so many more, how can you dislike it? The band's brilliant, un-imitatable sound evolves after every album. To compare this album to the brown album or the big pink would be a mistake -- its not that this album isn't as good, they just modifed their sound. GREAT ALBUM!
0399103422|5.0|Absolutely excellent.  As a big fan of the Godfather movies, I decided it was time to give the book a read, and I'm glad I did.  Both the well-known and the seemingly fringe characters from the movie are given such depth. <br />I'm someone who generally prefers movies to books, but don't ask me to decide here.  Both are truly great.
B00005NW02|5.0|I have been listening to SOAD since thier first self titled album (also a must listen to) and had high hopes for this album.  Though Toxicity definitly has a different sound than their first album, it is just as good.  Even if you are not sure if you like Chop Suey! I would recomend listening to some other songs by SOAD, such as Prison Song, Aerials, Innervision and The Legend of Zelda (both not on the cd, but on the net:), because all of thier songs have a style of thier own.
B00000BKE1|4.0|This is possibly the most overlooked gem in the Iron Maiden catalog for a couple reasons - (1) grunge had pretty much wiped out anything that could even remotely be classified as \\"80's rock\\" by mid-1992, and (2) a lot of wind had been taken out of Maiden's sails (and SALES) with their previous album, the disastrous \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\". A lot of fans had written them off for these reasons, and it's too bad because this is probably the most consistent and powerful album they'd done since \\"Powerslave\\" (no disrespect to the excellent \\"Somewhere In Time\\" and \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\", but those were concept albums and were understandably more concerned with overall mood than dynamics). Janick Gers is more of a presence on this album, co-writing two of the singles, the incredibly fast-yet-melodious \\"Be Quick Or Be Dead\\" and the ballad (a Maiden first!) \\"Wasting Love\\". The third single \\"From Here To Eternity\\" is very catchy, and elsewhere you find typical IM trademarks like their various epic mood pieces (\\"Afriad To Shoot Strangers\\", \\"Fear of the Dark\\"), poppish rockers (\\"Judas Be My Guide\\", and the lyrically-devoid \\"Weekend Warrior\\"), and a smattering of other good tunes and so-so tunes. The production is very bottom-heavy, showing that Maiden was unashamed of its 80's roots as other bands were going to accentuating the treble end of their music. Synths are still present, but are muted compared to their use on some of their late 80's albums. Better than \\"No Prayer\\" and either of their first two albums, but still a notch below classics like \\"Number of the Beast\\" and \\"Seventh Son\\".
B00005B6NC|5.0|I've seen this several times on cable and each time I saw something new. I bought it. I still see something new each time I view it get scared in different parts as I notice more and have yet to get tired of the movie. Never having seen Vin Diesel before he was just wonderful. I'm going to watch it again!
B00000BKE0|2.0|In a word, awful.  This CD contains three decent hit singles in \\"Holy Smoke\\", \\"Tailgunner\\" and \\"Bring Your Daughter...To The Slaughter\\" and another catchy tune in the aptly-named \\"Hooks In You\\".  Stupid and derivative lyrics and substandard musicianship aside (not that they play them bad, but these are songs where a band like Maiden can just \\"phone it in\\"), all are good enough to make you hum along with repeated listens.  Too bad they're surrounded by turkeys like \\"Mother Russia\\", \\"Fates Warning\\", \\"Public Enema Number One\\", \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\" and \\"The Assassin\\".  The title track is acceptable, although it's basically the blueprint for \\"Afriad To Shoot Strangers\\" on the following album (and \\"Strangers\\" is better).  And what's up with Bruce Dickenson's voice?  He sounds like he's been gargling battery acid and chain smoking unfiltered pieces of tire rubber.  I would call this the weakest album they've ever done.
6305841861|5.0|This movie directed by Sam Ramie is great! It has funnieness(I don't know if that is a word) makes you scared and is an all around great movie. The excitement is great but how this movie is connected to Evil Dead 1 is confusing.
6305075492|4.0|This DVD is a good quality transfer. The picture is good considering it is from 1920. It is in full-screen, with color-tinting (blue for night scenes, yellow for interior scenes, etc.)<br />The soundtrack on this version (Image) is great! It is an eerily, serialism-esque score written just for this film. Some silent films have been given a \\"modern treatment\\" with contemporary scores, but this DVD is judiciouly been given an appropriately \\"period-feel\\" in relation to the time and place that this movie was made. The score fits the film extremely well and is a well crafted work.<br />The DVD also comes with a commentary soundtrack that teaches the viewer about the film and the time in which it was shot in Germany. There is plenty of explanation about Expressionism as an art form in film, literature, and art of that time. A must for any film student!<br />I highly reccomend this DVD. It was well worth the price! It's literally amazing that an eighty year old film can still entertain and surprise a completely foreign audience, but some things about human beings are just universal and this film encompasses much that is universal in mankind.
0521008433|5.0|The table of contents that Amazon has listed here is from the 1986 edition and is very misleading and an injustice to this important and valuable book.  The new 2001 edition has 19 chapters and is very expanded and reorganised to include many new communicative approaches.  Look at another online bookseller for a proper table of contents.
B000002IQW|5.0|One of my favorite Skid Row albums.
0553573403|5.0|I would consider myself an average guy who appreciates a good book regardless of genre. Epic Fantasy happens to be my favorite. I've read some classics like those from C.S. Lewis and Tolkein. I've read some newer stuff like those from Robert Jordan and Terry Brooks. I have never read anything like George R. R. Martin's series 'A Song of Ice and Fire.' <br />This is not your typical fantasy series. Do not expect magic swords & rings, all-powerful wizards, elves, dwarves, goblins, trolls, or the one evil entity bent on destroying the world. In fact, don't expect more than a hint of magic at all. It's dark and gritty, with sex and violence unmatched in any fantasy I have read. Your mind will boggle at the endless twists and turns it takes. You'll have love/hate relationships with every character as you bounce back and forth between who is your favorite. The story is very unpredictable. You'll think you have something figured out, only to be bounced back in some other direction.<br />You've read many books where each chapter is about a different character. At the end of one chapter about your hero Bill Smith, you are left hanging and are disappointed to find out that the next 3 chapters are incredibly slow and involve characters you don't care about. Then you are so relieved when you get back to a chapter about Bill. I thought this book would be the same way. Then it turned out that after every single chapter, regardless of the character, I was left hanging and wanted to read more about that character. It was strange being that interested about everyone constantly.<br />Only 3 of the series has been released at this point and the end of book 3 blew me away. I actually hollared out loud. I can't wait for the fourth one to come out. <br />This is easily the best fantasy series I've read. I would call it a Political Fantasy because so much of it is centered around the decisions and betrayals of those vying for power.<br />Try not to get your hopes up too much about anything. Even the best book or film in the world has trouble living up to the hype in your mind. Buy this book, look forward to reading it, then enjoy it. It will make you think and will keep you entertained for quite sometime.
B00003Q43A|1.0|I mean that, literally. This is one of the worst movies that it has ever been my displeasure to have to sit through. Message to the director: Next time, try adding a plot to your movie.
0553573403|5.0|I've read through many of the poor reviews here and have come to the conclusion that 99% of these people have only read the first book and know nothing of Martin's ultimate plan.<br />Martin originally planned on a trilogy when he began writing these books. According to an interview with him, he had already written 1200 pages for 'A Game of Thrones' and wasn't even close to where he wanted to finish it. This is when he realized he would have to split the first book into 2. It appears the same happened with what would have been books 2 & 3 turning this into a 6 book series.<br />So many of the poor reviews are based on the fact that he doesn't wrap everything up in the first book. \\"Nothing is resolved\\" is a common phrase in them. Well, guess what, book 1 is part of what is expected to be a 6 book series. My assumption is that things won't be all resolved until the end of book 6. I remember reading \\"The Sword of Shannara\\" by Terry Brooks. I loved it. The world is saved at the end of the book. I then read book 2 of the series \\"The Elfstones of Shannara.\\" It was basically book 1 re-written. Evil tries to take over the world, good guys prevent it, all the heroes live, everyone is happy. Book 3 was the exact same. What's the point of making it a \\"series\\" if each book is its own story?<br />Read 'A Game of Thrones' with an open mind and don't expect it to resemble any other Epic Fantasy you've read. You'll enjoy it.<br />One last note...I noticed another phrase repeated in many of the poor reviews also. \\"For some reason, I couldn't put it down\\" Interesting... This was usually followed by an explanation as to why this was the case. The explanation usually mentioned expecting things to be resolved. To that I say, read book 2. Then read book 3. Expect things to be resolved by book 6. I think you will be happy you did.
B00005Q45W|4.0|My friend who gave this to me advised that I not try to operate any heavy equipment or attempt any complicated tasks while listening to this CD because it &quot;takes you somewhere else&quot;.<BR>It does.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When I saw the coming attractions for Moulin Rouge I wanted to see it instantly.  I already loved Ewan McGregor from Train Spotting and had been following his career from there.  I didn't get to see it when it came to theatres though because my husband said it was a sissy movie and he wouldn't go see it.  SO I let it go till it came to video.  I rented it and watched it while he was at work one day.  Reduced to a melted puddle of my former self I basked in the glow of this Excellent film.  It has everything anyone (not just girls) could want.  It funny, romantic, exciting, has the usual good vs. evil plot, sad, tragic and overall absolutely impressively done as Baz always does. The colors the costumes the songs everything touched me in ways a movie never has before.  The best part is when Ewan is singing his version of Elton John's \\"Your Song\\" to Nicole and she makes this expression on her face at one point that is just so cute and typical of a silly girl falling in love.  It's superb! Not even his version of Romeo and Juliet touched me like Moulin Rouge has.  I can't get enough of it now singing the songs knowing the lines, it simply stays with you at all times, once Baz has hooked you, you are done.  There aren't enough words nor enough roomk here for me to talk about this movie I can go on for hours!
B0000508U6|5.0|I was given this album as a Christmas present, only really knowing &quot;Yellow&quot; when I got it.  I was a little skeptical, thinking I'd like the Travis album I got more (which I regret thinking).  However this ablum is by far the best I've bought this year, and it completely surprised me.  I can say I love every song on this album.<br />I think that's because of the sheer emotion and honesty that the whole band pours into the songs, from Chris Martin's hopeful and yearning voice to Jon Buckland's pulsing guitar riffs, every song comes forth as true and heartfelt.  They strum by like a lazy rainy afternoon, with a consistent flow being held together by a constant acoustic guitar.<br />Highlights of the album include the slow-crescendo ballad &quot;Spies,&quot; the purely romantic &quot;Sparks&quot; which is followed by the equally true &quot;Yellow,&quot; the piano-led and hazy &quot;Trouble,&quot; and the very touching and powerful closer &quot;Everything's Not Lost.&quot;<br />This album has a slow but beautiful progression with a &quot;here we are now, where do we go from here?&quot; feel to it that melts all together.  I highly recommend it, it's the first honest and genuinely moving album I've heard in a long time.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is quite a film to behold. It's a technically stunning achievement that really gives you more than you really deserve. It's not only a brilliant musical but a really tender love story that is uplifting and tragic.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor are amazing as the hopeless romantics and John Leuizamo is really funny as the Ewan Mcgregor's friend and sidekick. The Directing by Baz Luhrmann is great, and the cinematography by John O'Connell is breathtaking. If you want to put a smile on your face, Moulin Rouge is the movie to put it.
B000056MOD|1.0|If you haven't seen any of the other Highlander movies, then you will like this one. It's not a bad movie really. It just doesn't fit in with the established timeline for the Highlander story. We know, from the first movie, that Conner wins the prize. However in the world his death at the hands of Duncan fits into THAT, I have yet to figure out. My friends and I were sorely disappointed with this one.
B000003N7G|5.0|Each time I listen to this CD it seems to project something new into the ether. A must for all who appreciate music that is not just a collection of sounds ordered in some predictable or derivitative fashion. One of 11 musical compositions that I honestly beleive deserves a maximum star rating. In most instances requires several listenings to gather most of what Coltrane intended: but then again I have found most of Coltrane's work like this. I have read that during one live performance in the 60's Coltrane and his band played one peice of music uninterrupted for just over 3 hours. I believe that the drummer got tired or annoyed or both towards the end and so they stopped. Pity he died so young.
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt was an awsome book to read because it really gave me a preaty good view on how people delt with poverty in the old days, and this book can open a blind mans eyes and show them what it was rally like.
6304510861|5.0|I have no idea what this movie is about but it still is one of the coolest movies I have ever seen.  The acting is great, you keep wondering what is going on, and you can't wait to see what happens next.  I highly recomend buying this movie.
068484267X|4.0|The book Angela's Ashes was a very interesting story about the author, Frank McCourt's, life as a child.

1573226521|5.0|'The Beach' is undoubtedly by favourite novel of all time.  It is not only intelligent and funny but it's gripping and has a lot to say.  The reader is first of all introduced to Richard, an English backpacker who has just arrived in Thailand.  Once there he is given a map to a beach, a so-called backpacker's paradise.  So off he goes along with two French travellers, Françoise and Etienne, that he persuades to come with him.  However, before setting off he draws the map for a couple of Americans.  Once they reach the beach it's every bit as beautiful as they were led to believe, with a small island community under the firm leadership of Sal.<br />As the book progresses it becomes apparent that the often humorous yet perceptive narrative is a mask for the real darkness of this community.  The central irony that the quest for true paradise ultimately destroys it runs throughout this novel, and characterisation is second to none.  Unlike the movie, the book's depiction of Richard's love for Françoise is a much more subtle affair.  Indeed, it is the repression of human emotions and the stifling of human desires and needs that eventually leads Richard into madness.  Once again, this is much better evoked in the book, with several hallucination scenes being at once funny and creepy.  The contract between the beautiful island paradise and Richard's personal hell as the community become progressively obsessed with preserving their paradise is wonderfully evoked.  Yet it is when a group of marauders appear on the island and there is a terrible accident that the book really impresses.  In many ways `The Beach' is similar to `Lord Of The Flies', yet this novel also works as the masterpiece of travel literature, its flowing narrative and sharp sense of humour making it an instant hit but also intensely disturbing.

B00004Z459|4.0|I actually found myself embarrassed to purchase this album.  Despite numerous recommendations from friends and family, I could not overlook that this was just the 'new' sound like Kid and Limp that I don't find myself oozing over, really.  And no, I don't own either of those bands.  However, now that I own this piece it has found its way consistently into my 4-disc car changer.  They have made an outstanding new sound for themselves in an almost-first album release, and I don't doubt the 'next' one will be even more enthralling.  Must-buy for the new music hungry.  You can compare it to ... well... I find it hard to classify them into another band's sound.  Perhaps that is good?
B000002B7M|5.0|When I bought this album, I'll be honest, i had really only heard Crazy Train. So i got home, put it in my cd player, and listened to it the whole way through. I was blown away! Every song on here is fantastic! Ozzy's vocals and Randy Rhoad's guitar is as some one said in another review\\"a match made in heaven\\". Here's what i thin of each song:<br />I don't know - The perfect opener for any album! Starts it off with a really rockin' feel...great guitar solos too!<br />Crazy train - This song still gets airplay today, and with good reason! <br />Goodbye to Romance - A slower song, about Ozzy saying goodbye to Black Sabbath...pretty cool song <br />Dee - This song is a 40 second classical guitar solo by Randy Rhoads...it's short, but very pretty and showcases his talents on acoustic, as opposed to the firey solos he usually does.<br />Suicide Solution - Great song, but you should check out the one on \\"Tribute\\"!<br />Mr. Crowley - The organ in the beggining is a bit too long, but this has some of the best guitar solos i've ever heard!<br />No Bone Movies - Funny song, with great lyrics.<br />Revelation(Mother Earth) - This is possibly the best song on the album. It starts off slow with kind of a classical feel, and slowly builds up and up and there's a great guitar solo at the end.<br />Steal Away The Night - Good way to end an album, although this song is only average compared to the rest!<br />Well, thats it. If you are a fan of heavy metal/rock and don't own this album, buy it!
B00005QG9J|5.0|I'll make it short - the music speaks for itself.  Incubus recently pushed out Our Lady Peace on my abso-favorite band list.  Cheezy as that is, it isn't easy to do.  I had the double-pleasure of picking up their first CD just a few months before the new one came out.  Their progression on the new CD is extremely important, as they have actually had many, many CDs in a long history.  They've certainly acquired that special sound, and it will be a long, hard road before someone takes over the top spot from them.  Buy it and next thing you know you'll be buying it for your friends.
0451527712|4.0|I read Franenstein for a Senior English class in High School.  To be honest, i wasn't personally expecting much from this book.  I thought it would be a plain horror story.  I had in my head a story that was simply about a monster killing people.  After reading this book i realized that I was wrong!  This book brought out many emotions within me.  I found it very insubstantial that Victor had even created a monster.  There is much more to this book than that fact.  It was difficult to not feel pitty for both Victor and his monster. I would, and already have, recommended this book to a range of readers.
0694526088|5.0|Finally a book based on extensive research on why companies are truly excellent in what they do.  No fads, no flash in the pans just hard work that's focus on their mission and core business.  In my mind a must read for anyone who is tired of mediocrity or the status quo.

0789723107|5.0|One of the tings i really enjoyed about this book is its brevity and to-the-point attitude. It's not Nielsen, nor does it attempt to be. It clearly states at the beginning what it is. <br />While a lot of it is not earth-shatteringly new, none of it is stupid or wrong. There are many, many good tips for beginners and a lot of good reminders for folks who have been doing this sort of thing for a couple years.<br />I think it's a great book to introduce some of the real basics of usability in a digestable form (I personally have a copy of Nielsen by my bedside to put me to sleep it's so boring). Not a book for the seasoned &quot;Information Architect&quot;, and I'm surprised that any of them have bought it, what did they think they were getting into? It's a book for the independent designer who doesn't have the benefit of working with an IA. They can use this book and apply there talent in useful effective ways.
6305744742|5.0|Tim burton's vision of the characters from the old-monied, aristocratic family was superb and hit it right on the spot. Not continuing the original metaphors these characters played would be a dissapointment. The most recent TV series flopped because they failed to capture the character of the family. In the most recent TV series, Gomez was made into a bungling idiot and so was everyone else, but Tim Burton's version made Gomez the a man of the world, a careless aristocrat and a charming debonaire, sort of a dark version of Red Butler from Gone with the Wind, Morticia, the mysterious seductress, a classier version of Elvira. Wendy was the silent misunderstood psycho, and pugsley, the simplistic sadist who always gets outwitted by his deep and sinister sister. Lurch plays the ever faithful and dutiful butler and the architecture and the richness of the Victorian house they lived in was a character in the movie in itself. My suggestion is to buy the movie not just for its entertainment value but also for the amount of depth and vision the director put into creating this masterpiece. A good comparison would be the superman movie. Christopher Reeve played the best superman and after him, no one could live up to it anymore. Just like the Addams family, remaking it with different character personalities would be a complete and utter failure.
0345440757|2.0|There are some useful tips in this book, but I am always wary of someone who claims to have a method that is THE way to raise children. <br />I tried some of her methods of getting a newborn on a schedule and it absolutely did not work. After talking to many experienced moms about this, the unanimous answer was that most newborns will not get on a schedule until they are several months old. I found that to be the case with my baby. My baby didn't start living with a schedule until she was 5 months old. Now she is doing just great. But, according to Tracy, if you don't start them out on a schedule right away then pandemonium sets in. Not so!<br />Some of her breastfeeding advice is questionable. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all babies be breastfed for the first year of life. Tracy gives advice such as \\"If a woman is concerned about her body image, it might NOT be best for her to breastfeed. She's likely to hear that she's selfish, but who are we to make her feel guilty and wrong?\\" and \\"Formula today is more refined and chock-full of nutrients than ever\\" - giving the impression to a mother who might not have educated herself on the difference in breast milk and formula that the two are equal. There is no question that breast milk is best for babies. Medical evidence for this is overwhelming, yet Hogg underplays this fact.<br />She advises to \\"always wipe off your nipples with a clean washcloth because milk can be a breeding ground for bacteria and cause thrush on your breast and the baby's mouth.\\" First of all, if she had been awake in nursing school she would have learned that wiping something with water does nothing to remove bacteria - that is why we use soap. Second, my lactation consultant, doctor and every breastfeeding book I have ever read says to never wipe your nipples with anything, but to always let them air dry. <br />I have read 7 books on breastfeeding and my favorite is \\"The Ultimate Book of Breastfeeding Answers\\" by Dr. Jack Newman. Dr. Newman is a pediatrician and one of the foremost experts on breastfeeding in North America. Another good one that gives lighthearted practical advice is \\"So That's What They're For\\" by Janet Tamaro.<br />Hogg gives some sleep advice, but it didn't work for me. If you are looking for a book to help with your baby's sleep habits, a better one to read is called, \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\\" by Dr. Marc Weissbluth.<br />Finally, READ THE ARTICLE ABOUT HOGG IN NEWSWEEK from Feb. 26, 2001. You can find it online on Newsweek's website. Tracy has apparently embellished her credentials and when pressed for clarification, she got teary eyed and dismissed the questions.<br />The best parenting advice I have gotten has come from experienced parents I know and respect who have good kids. Don't trust your baby to a self proclaimed expert who has merely done a fabulous job of marketing herself.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|I thought this was gonna be a corny movie when i saw the trailer for it in the thearters, but i saw the movie and i must say, Ben and Brian , did a great job in this movie.  The movie had me rolling and tears coming out my eyes. It is an original and very very very funny.  When it comes out i am getting this DVD
0880389052|5.0|Having read David Eddings and Raymond feists, and George RR Martins entire collections. I have to say that Drizzt is my favorite fantasy character. This book is only 300 pages comnpared to 1000 page monsters im use to. I read this book in two nights. I wanted to read it on the train ride in to pennstation NYC but it is such smooth interesting great work. I just can't stop thinking about what Drizzt is going to do next!!!! If you are a fantasy fan this is a must buy
B00005221L|5.0|This is one of Arnold's best movies, you want guns, killing, gore, this movie has it all, this is an awsome movie about an alien killing off a squad of special forces one by one, and Arnold has to make it out of there alive with whoever he can.  If you liked Commando, you'll love Predator
B00005R2BG|5.0|At first I thought this movie was going to be long and boring about an old night club, but actully it keeps you glued to your seat!I especially like the way that there is alot of variety in it. By that I mean it has singing, dancing, crying, laughing, supence and love. The songs are fabulous. Ewan Mc Greggor and Nicole Kidman have GREAT voices. When you see this movie give it a chance before running into your room. It's a really great movie if you give it a chance. P.S. It's better the second time!<BR> My advise to you is to Go see this movie. At the end of this movie you leave with some great things to think about, truth, beauty,freedom and above all things love.
B000003TAW|5.0|This CD is one of the CD's that wins the award for Longest Time Spent in CD Player.<br />It's songs are so good, and you can relate to them. And it's not just for nerds. Anyone can listen to Weezer, because it's just so easy to listen to, and the hooks are AWESOME.<br />Rivers Cuomo is better than probably any songwriter/singer/guitarist in punk (except for maybe Rancid's Tim Armstrong). His lyrics are so awesome and his melodies and solos are beyond genius.<br />My fav songs are My Name Is Jonas, Buddy Holly, Undone, Say It Ain't So, and In The Garage, but my favorite song is The World Has Turn And Left Me Here.<br />This CD is beyond essential to your collection.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Movie Summary:  Elle Woods has her entire life planned out. It's been so easy for her. All she has left to do is finish her last year of college, say good-bye to her sorority sisters, and marry the man of her dreams. But as graduation day approaches, things start to fall apart. The man of her dreams Warner Huntington the third dumps her because she isn't good enough and goes off to Harvard Law School. Elle is shattered. She decides the only thing she can do is get into Harvard Law school and win him back.<br />My Opinion: I wasn't expecting much going into Legally Blonde, but I knew I liked Reese Witherspoon. Little did I know that 96 minutes later I'd like her even more. Legally Blonde is one of those movies that people like to hate without seeing. They dismiss it because they think they know what it's about just like the characters in the movie think they know Elle and dismiss her. Both are wrong.  Legally Blonde is not a deep movie, but it's fun and it strikes a cord. It's an enjoyable experience and Reese is entirely loveable as the goodhearted Elle. Elle has never had to apply herself or work for anything, so everyone just dismisses her as another dumb blonde. It's no surprise that when she puts her mind to it, she gets results! It's also very fun to watch her changing wardrobe and hairstyle. I know it's hard to believe, but the term guilty pleasure fits this movie to a tee. You don't have to work hard watching it. All it wants to do is entertain you and make you happy. Thumbs up on both counts.<br />DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen anamorphic - 2.35:1 and Full Screen (Standard) - 1.33:1 Sound: DD5.1 Extras: Deleted Scenes, Featurettes, Commentaries, Trivia Track<br />What You Should Do:  See this one. It's very fun. Don't be scared of it. You don't have to tell anyone that you even watched it much less that you liked it. Go ahead you know you want to.<br />Related Movies To Check Out: Doc Hollywood, Son In Law, Blast from the Past, Pleasantville
B00005U8EM|4.0|First off this is wrong to try to sell people something that does not have what it says it has on the box. There is no DTS sound on this disc it is a flat out lie, Just like wwf raw for xbox half of what was on the back of the case was not on the game. Studios and game makers need to have a little integrity and atleatst be honest about whats something offers or doesnt offer. The movie is great and has always been a favorite the documentry is entraining, the commentery very dull harlod ramis seems to be doing it only because they told him he had too or maybe he needed some money. There are no new intrveiews with anyone accept Andie Mcdowell,no Bill Murray or  Chirs elliot. If you have the old dvd or vhs this is not really whorth it if you have no GroundHog Day at all buy it.
B00005T30L|5.0|When I saw the trailers for GHOST WORLD, I was led to believe the overall tone of the movie would be a light, teenage comedy in the vein of say, Sixteen Candles. Sixteen Candles was (AND still is) a great coming-of-age movie, just so no one thinks I'm \\"dissing\\" it. In any case the trailer for GHOST WORLD, shall we say, was incomplete.<br />The movie offers so much more depth than you'd get from seeing the trailer. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johannson and Steve Buscemi all give us some of the best character-driven performances you will see in ANY movie from the past year. I didn't read the graphic novel the movie was based on, but it seems that the screenwriters and director have done a great job of translating it to film.<br />I think everyone who sees this movie will see bits of themselves in both Enid and Rebecca's lives. The feelings of not fitting in with your peer groups, not feeling attractive, not knowing what you're going to do with your life after graduation, etc. etc. will ring true with most of the movie's audience. <br />The relationship between Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi's characters is at the same time, complex and touching. When you see the movie, you'll understand how two unlikely people do make for good friends, even though they meet in an unconventional way. To tell you how they do would give away one of the movie's charming surprises.<br />My only negative comment would be that the ending is ambiguous and left me with one big question and no real direction for any answers. You'll have to watch GHOST WORLD to get my drift. <br />Overall an excellent story...
B00005QDW1|5.0|At first I didn't like the &quot;Hey Baby&quot; song, but its grown on me.  My boyfriend bought me the CD after hearing them perform &quot;Hella Good&quot; on tv and thought I'd like it.. I do.. it's one of my favorites!! The CD is awesome and although it may not have as much &quot;emotion&quot; as previous albums, you can tell they just let loose and had fun.  Its a kick-back CD with fun sounds and some fun lyrics... not EVERY CD has to be totally involved.. I like it a lot!
B00003CY0V|3.0|As a general rule, I've always felt that technology doesn't translate well to the big screen.  The only two exceptions are WarGames and The Matrix.  Swordfish is no Matrix.  That scene with Jackman tumbling almost endlessly down a hill....How long did that scene go on anyway?  It's an okay rental....but if you haven't seen it yet.....Wait for cable.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I saw this movie at a friend's \\"Moulin Rouge\\" party, so I couldn't leave.  Had I been in a theater, I would have left after 30 minutes.<BR>The movie had no character development, wasn't historically accurate, and the music was all rip-offs and remakes.<BR>Don't waste your time or money!
B00004Z459|5.0|It starts with one...song.  I heard \\"In the End\\" on the radio, and I thought, 'Wow, great song...it rages yet it's not evil rage, it's human rage.'  Then I heard \\"Papercut\\" and I was just blown away.  These two songs are what enticed me to buy Hybrid Theory, and I don't regret it.  All the songs have thought-provoking words, and combine rap vocals, rock vocals, and electronics extremely well.  A debut this good is rarely seen, in my opinion.  Linkin Park has an appeal that can carry over into all different genres...their songs are just so relatable.  All this coming from someone who mainly listens to the Spanish pop/rock sounds of Shakira, Mana, and Juanes.  If you buy Hybrid Theory, you most likely won't be thinking, 'Man, I just wasted 15 bucks.'  It will be like, 'This one's gonna be in my CD player for a VERY long time.'  Enjoy!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|A princess, guarded by a dragon, waits in a castle for rescue by her true love.  Such is the plot of \\"SHREK\\".  The wonder and innovative rejumbling of fairy tale characters makes this an utterly delightful film.  The cliches are changed; the prince is not so charming after all.  The big bad Ogre is a good guy and the princess is under a spell with an unusual twist.  Her freedom, and transformation scene is clever.  The little folk do survive the \\"dastardly deeds\\" of the Prince,  and  manage to live happily ever after.  It's all wonderful fun.  Much like, \\"ANTZ\\", and \\"A BUG'S LIFE.\\"
B00003CXI1|4.0|I absolutly loved the movie! People are saying it is a horrible movie and I totally disagree. While it was missing the best parts of the book, it is truly a great movie. The Quidditch scene is exactly as I imagined it. I heard someone say it was too computer generated... yeah, seeing as it WAS computer generated it would be pretty hard not to be! The sets are beautiful and the actors, even the kids, are outstanding! Two out of the three times I saw it, everyone clapped afterwards! I have never seen that happen before! Far better than Lord of the Rings, which, to put it frankly, put me to sleep,  this is a movie that everyone, ages 6 - 106 can appreciate and enjoy. I am greatly anticipating the release of the DVD!  It will no doubt be great! ....
B00005UEAR|5.0|My girlfriend gave me this CD for Valentine's Day, and I haven't been able to stop listening to it since!  I mean, no matter what, whether I'm studying, on the way to work, this is always playing.  There's just SO much goodness here.  Just to annoy everyone, let's go through it a song at a time.<br />1. The Glass Prison- Whoa!  Heavy stuff!  This is one mean mother of a song.  Great chops from John Petrucci here, and a pretty wicked bass solo from John Myung.  I don't like the turntables in there, but don't let that turn you off, it's like 2 seconds of a 14-minute song.<br />2. Blind Faith- More relaxed, with a heavy crescendo on the chorus.  Nice piano interlude from Jordan.  Pretty song.<br />3. Misunderstood- Very dark, sludgy track, with a weird solo from John.  I love the lyrics (&quot;How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me?&quot;).  Godly drumwork from Mike.<br />4. The Great Debate- Yeah, it kinda sounds like Tool, but I say, &quot;Tool who?&quot;.  This burns Tool right to the ground!  I swear, if just one Tool fan trashes this song, POW!  Nice lyrics here.<br />5. Disappear- James LaBrie's first writing credit (I think).  Yeah, it's kinda slow, but I love it.  It almost hypnotizes me.<br />Okay, now onto the big boy, the title track.  A 42-minute exploration of the human psyche.  John wrote most of it, but Mike did some too.  Anyway, here are the parts.<br />1. Overture- Nice classical-ish intro.  Very pretty.  There should have been more keyboard in there, but oh well.<br />2. About to Crash- This track gets everything going.  Nice lyrics here, and very catchy.<br />3. War Inside My Head- Heavier, crunchier track.  This is where  the song starts to get angry.<br />4. The Test That Stumped Them All- Fast, heavy, oh so good.  Mike practically destroys his drumkit on this one.  Very demented lyrics, from who else?  Mike.<br />5. Goodnight Kiss- Much softer, kind of a lullaby.  This proves Mike is a very versatile writer.  It's so funny where James says &quot;I'm just a poor girl, scared of this cruel world&quot;.  He sounds so emotionally sincere when he says it too.  I'd bet anything that Mike put that in just to hear James say that.  Crazy guy, he is!<br />6. Solitary Shell- Probably the most upbeat thing they've ever done.  All acoustic, with very catchy lyrics.  It reminds me a lot of Transatlantic.  Nice classical guitar type solos at the end.<br />7. About to Crash (reprise)- Nice feel-good rocker.  Reminds me a a lot of Rush.<br />8. Losing Time/Grand Finale- This is the end, where James brings it home.  Kinda slow and easy, and it ties up all the loose ends.  You almost feel like crying when it ends.<br />Wow, what an album!  Over 90 minutes, and not a bad moment on it.  Is it just me, or does Petrucci just get better and better?  He cannot be stopped!  If you love Dream Theater, buy this, it will knock you to the ground!
B00005ASQ1|2.0|overall this movie is mediocre<br />this movie hints at a lot of subtle plot twists that as far as i've flipped through the reviews haven't been noticed<br />the reason why jamal and anna paquin's relationship falls<br />is between of coleridge, who appears like a gay sal mineo type, the most interesting character in this movie, a 2 liner<br />and at the end when anna and jamal's love interest falls apart you can hint at the insinuation a realtionship was going to blossom between coledridge and him<br />i wish the screenplay writer was more daring to admit he was doing this and gave more lines to the coledridge type, because he would have added more tension to the movie
B00004Z459|3.0|Hmm...what to say about Linkin Park. At first, i must say, i loved the band and everything about them. But after a couple of months, im beginning to realize that ive heard this before. This music...whatever you want to call it....is NOT nu-metal. This is NOT rock. This is...at its simplest, POP. Yes it is POP. That 3-letter word hated upon a starting \\"rock\\" or \\"nu-metal\\" group. Linkin Park is nothing but POP. If you want to listen to somthing better, i suggest Silverchair, Staind, Slipknot, or Marilyn Manson, people who actually put out good music. (...)
B00005A1PR|5.0|Acoustic Soul is to me an amazing album. India Arie is able to mix jazz and R&amp;B in a deeply truthful and emotional way. Listening to the album, I can really make that connection, which is often so hard to find with an artist. The lyrics are natural, poetic and heartfelt. However, India is versatile enough to appeal to audiences that are not primarily fans of one genre. She reminds me of a combination of both Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill. As different as these two women are, India has the strong power of Lauryn, and the exotic softness of Erykah. Acoustic Soul's earthy rhythms feel more rustic than Neo Soul as they come with a voice that is human, and from almost another time of toil and strength.  India seems to be a wise and experienced artist who has been through what many younger listeners have only heard about. It is encouraging to hear an artist who represents real qualities of what it is to be truly talented and woman. Strength, Courage, &amp; Wisdom, and Video really bring these qualities into focus as India proclaims her own self pride for what she stands for and has become.
0553213105|4.0|After reading many excellent, yet somewhat depressing novels, Austen's Pride and Prejudice, came as refreshing and uplifting treat. More of a powerful weapon than the extraordinary novel that it is, Austen uses the book to fiercely criticize nineteenth century society and the essence of human nature while still managing to create an extraordinary and captivating plot. <BR>Beginning at the novel's outset, the reader becomes a puppet at the mercy of Austen's ability to evoke any emotions she desires within her readers. <BR>By creating a diction and syntax unique to each character Austen holds the reader within her grasp. All of the characters are very different from each other in many aspects; this creates grounds for conflict and essentially propels the plot. <BR>Also, each of the characters is somewhat of an extremity of a certain characteristic that most people possess. Mrs. Bennet is the spoiled side of our personalities, Mr. Darcy the proud side, Lydia the irresponsible side, Jane the quiet side, Mary the feminist side, and so on.<BR> The novel encompasses main elements from many different genres of books such as romance, humor, adventure, suspense, and tragedy, which make for a very entertaining read. Read it when you are feeling down or worn out, you'll find yourself believing that fairytales do come true.

0790751089|1.0|I am in awe that so many can find this dreary, boring self indulgence so &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;lovely&quot;! I hate this garbage!<BR>This has to be one of the most boring films I have ever seen. And please! Spare me Eastwood's method acting! Actualy, no, that's not true - Eastwood doesn't act - he's just Eastwood. Don't get me wrong now. Clint has his place in westerns and the odd cop shooting-say nothing-look mean Dirty Harry fuilm, but the Great Lover! N0 WAY!<BR>Moreover, while you're all getting all gooey over the so called &quot;love story&quot;, just remember that this is just a glorification of adultery! I am no prude, but come on! At least TRY to set an example in the movies you make! <BR>Awful! In fact, I have never managed to endure it long enough to see it in full!
0064407667|4.0|We read the book together Mom (age 30), son (age 14), and two daughters (ages 10 and 12).  It took us about 7 hours to complete the book, reading a couple of hours per night.  Each day the children and myself anxiously waited for reading time due to our curiosity of what would happen next!  We are now anxiously awaiting Amazon to deliver the rest of the books in the series!<br />The book was dreadfully morbid yet intriguingly unique and fun to read as a group.  The author is an absolute nutcase who is bound to make you laugh in some twisted sort of way.  He is quite upfront about the book being a horrible book and that makes it all the better.<BR> <br />Outside of [feeling the author insults the reader's intelligence by some insuations] the book is still definitely worth the read and it captivated the children and myself enough for us to order the rest of the series.<br />We all applaud the author's unique style and hilarious presentation of these unfortunate events. He himself is just morbid enough to be responsible for telling this dreadful tale.
079073804X|5.0|The Exorcist's biggest strength and what makes it such a great film is in how seriously it takes its subject.  Although it is a horror film, and a very scary one at that, it sometimes seems like calling it that isn't doing justice to the film.  The Exorcist is very much a human drama with realistic character trying to deal with a crisis that they don't understand.<BR>The filmmakers are more interested in giving us real characters, drawn from real life people rather than from other films.  It is very easy to sympathize with them.  The movie takes its time developing them, their strengths and weaknesses, so that by the time we get to the climactic showdown we really don't know how it will end.<BR>The movie is technically brilliant too.  The camera work, the lighting, the sound are all superb.  The script is beautifully written by WP Blatty.  He actually takes the time to have his protagonist seek medical help to the point where the doctors don't believe that they have the power to help.  They suggest an exorcism to cure the heroine's daughter, and she looks at them like they're crazy.  Blatty doesn't make any compromises.  The heroine, Chris McNeil, has no religious beliefs.  SO it would be very unlikely that she would seek out a priest to perform an exorcism unless she reached a point where she must accept that that is the only thing that can save her daughter.  I also liked how even the priest is skeptical, trying to tell her that exorcisms aren't done anymore since the dicovery of mental illness and things like that.  This movie does not jump in to anything.  It takes it's time setting things up for payoffs.<BR>The Exorcist is no doubt the scariest film ever made for the simple fact that it takes its subject as seriously as Spielberg treated the Holocaust in Schindler's List.  It doesn't go for cheap thrills and monsters jumping out from behind walls.  When I first saw The Exorcist and a friend asked me what it was like I said that it was the cinematic equivalent of being attacked by a wild animal.  Over the years my opinions about the film have not changed.  This is powerful, exciting, and brilliant filmmaking.
B00000JXZ7|5.0|This is Ms. Chung's a historical recording and legacy for all of us. You will easily recognize her unique way of redition. I really enjoyed her Bruch: I'm sure no one can immitate her style about those two works. I also liked the 3rd movement of Mendelssohn: pretty vivid and precise.<br />The sound quality is superb: more analog sound: warm and soft. Wow... 96Khz/24bit! Keep up the great job, Decca!! I think I don't have to want DVD-Audio if I can get this quality always.<br />Why don't you collect Decca's legends starting this wonderful CD?
0425179877|4.0|I read this book and Chris Krafts books together. They are very similar and I am giving them the same review. If you had to choose one, I would go with Kraft's book since he was at the space program from the very start. But both these books give a view of the space program from Mission Control's perspective. While not quite as interesting as the astronauts, it is still very interesting. As an engineer, it makes me yearn for a time when an engineers work was part of something bigger in the nation's consciousness.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was by FAR one of the greatest films ever made. The only movie that is even close to the running with this one is \\"Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.\\"<br />Harry Potter had, what I thought to be, a magical atmosphere that simply beckoned to you to sit on the edge of your sit (like when you were 7 or 8 and you went and saw Star Wars) and get totally lost in it all. <br />Although I was disappointed that they didn't really persue the emnity between Harry and Malfoy, or show the album full of wizarding pictures of Harry's family, they nonetheless stayed VERY close to the plot, the time sequence and the magic. <br />I loved the cast of HP&TSS. They picked the perfect Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Profs Dumbledore, Snape and Quirrell. I was a little disappointed in who they picked for Prof McGonagall. Not that I don't LOVE the actress that played her, I just thing that McGonagall should have been much younger... even though actress Maggie Smith was perfect in her portrayal of McGonagall's attitude. <BR>I can't wait for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets to come out next Fall. I'll be waiting.<br />We must expect great things from you Mr. Potter. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things - terrible, but great.
B000001ES4|5.0|Having never listened to new age music besides Enya, this CD really expanded my horizons. The instrumentals are great and the team of Sherry and Lovland work well together to produce great harmonies and soothing yet rythmic sounds. Although partial to more haunting melodies and soothing background choruses (more like Enya and 2002), this CD still remains one of my favorites and I highly recommend it.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Open your heart and ears and soak up this masterpiece. The lyrical and musical expressions coalesce to create inspiration of the highest order. I have listened to this over and over and find new meaning with each listening.
B00003CY0V|1.0|The only thing worse than watching this mess is watching it while listening to the commentary.  If John Travolta's character wants to know what's wrong with Hollywood these days, all he has to do is watch &quot;Swordfish.&quot;  Really just the first 30 minutes...  A complete failure... I feel bad for some of the good actors involved.
0618001905|4.0|These dying words of Mr Kurtz were first read in 1899 when HEART OF DARKNESS was published. Twain's KING LEOPOLD'S SOLILOQUY came out in 1905 and Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle wrote THE CRIME OF THE CONGO in 1909. Additionally, the Congo Reform Association (in support of which both Twain and Conan-Doyle wrote their books) began operating in 1904 with the sole purpose of bringing to public attention the terrible situation in the Congo Free State under the rule of Belgium's King Leopold II. It's obvious then that the horrific treatment of the Congolese as described in KING LEOPOLD'S GHOST was known about and well documented. The issue here is not one of a lack of awareness. In fact Hochschild says there was \\"a storm of righteous protest\\" and moral outrage in England and America when the facts became known. No, the issue is more to do with why this genocide of 100 years ago remains such a relatively unknown story and is rarely ever mentioned when the topic of discussion is man's cruelty to man. It's not because the carnage was insignificant. In terms of numbers the death toll stacks up well with other holocausts. Hochschild estimates the number of Congolese that died between 1885 - 1920 from between 5 to 10 million.<br />In attempting to come to terms with this and explain why there seems to be so little present-day consciousness of what took place, the author admits to his own lack of knowledge prior to his research. A partial answer is that in the Congo today, there is very little information available on this period. More significantly though it is because of the special nature of the Congo and its colonial history. But it seems to me the book shows that most importantly, in a country that has known only paroxysms, death is a constant and numbers are merely matters of scale on a continuum. The special characteristic of the Congo is that it is incredibly blessed with natural mineral wealth - coal, cobalt, copper, diamonds, gold, manganese, offshiore petroleum, silver, tin,uranium and zinc. Not even mentioned yet are the products that this book talks about and what King Leopold was greedily ravaging the country for - rubber, ivory and timber. Against this background, and with interests in Belgium, France, Germany, and England eyeing this and other African wealth, who really is surprised to learn that economic considerations and international political deliberations have in the past swept human-interest issues under the carpet. <br />Hochschild does an admirable job of highlighting the human rights context of his story. For him the heroes are the two founders of the Congo Reform Association - Edmund Dene Morel and Roger Casement and the villains are of course King Leopold and the man whom the King initially depended upon to organize the Congo Free State - Henry Morton Stanley. Morel's \\"flash of moral recognition\\" that something was terribly wrong in the Congo is how we begin this book. While we can see some of the colonials as illustrative of the heart of darkness, and Hochschild's description of some of the massacres is indeed gruesome, this book is far more than a simple, sensationalist, expose on the evils of the white-man and colonialism. There are some interesting sub-texts here. While white missionaries were instrumental in bringing much of the attrocities to light they were also not above dark deeds. Initially the Belgian church in the Congo portrayed criticisms as an attack on Roman Catholicism by protestant missionaries. This may have also been due to the fact that some were American, and black - George Washington Williams and William Sheppard for instance. Both catholics and protestants were also initially fooled by Leopold's pious pronouncements and believed that he was unaware of what was being done in his name.  <br />The Congo is a huge country. It has an ancient history and culture and it is populated with various different ethnic groups including pygmies. It was visited by Arab traders and slavers long before Europeansarrived and now, decades after independence, still struggles with issues related to political, economic, and social cohesion. KING LEOPOLD'S GHOST only covers a part of this history and therefore only offers a limited answer to the puzzle that is today's sorry state known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However even as a partial answer, it is well worth reading.
0821221841|5.0|I bought this book after taking a photo class at a local community college and was attempting to start on the trail of becoming a serious amateur photographer.  This book was _exactly_ what I needed.<br />It explains all the details of all the modern cameras you are likely to find.  Small, Medium and Large format cameras.  Think a pinhole camera is the best?  It isn't, and the plusses and minuses of pinhole cameras are discussed in this book.  He covers all forms of shutters.  Range finders.  Dual-lens cameras.  Everything.  If you are looking for an understanding of different cameras and their pros &amp; cons, this is the book to get.

0880389052|3.0|I guess now that I am an \\"adult\\", I am not supposed to enjoy books like this.  However, it's nice sometimes to read something where the lines between good and evil are not grey at all, especially with all the crazy things going on in our world today.  It's not difficult to sort out in this book who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.  And that's precisely why I enjoyed it.  It's obvious throughout the book that Drizzt will stick to his principles and his struggle against his evil heritage.  That's another reason I enjoyed it.  If you are looking for great and high-minded literature, look somewhere else.  But if you are a fantasy fan who wants a quick, enjoyable read with a very sympathetic and admirable main character, I highly recommend the entire Dark Elf Trilogy.
0345448898|1.0|Pullman has talent as a writer - there's no doubt about that. And his trilogy about Lyra Silvertongue (nee Bevaqua) starts off strongly - with wonderful characters, a delightful eye for detail, and a series of deliciously drawn worlds for the children characters to explore.<br /><br />But as this series progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid the author's antipathy toward religion (something he is very open about in interviews and his adult titles). When every single believer is evil, and every antagonist is a believer (and all these bad guys are Catholic) - well, our family used this as a starting point for a conversation on prejudice and intolerance, much as we would have if all the bad guys were black or Jewish or Latino and we didn't find out until we were into the second book.<br /><br />It's disappointing on many levels that the politically active Pullman would use a kids' book marketed as an alternative to something as positive and wholesome as Harry Potter as a vehicle for pushing anti-religious intolerance onto his readers. Were he simply interested in explaining atheism in a positive light, that would be one thing - and it's something writers like Robert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke managed to pull off quite well in titles aimed at young people. But to do so through the tactic of using dehumanizing cliches against people of faith is underhanded.<br /><br />Parents of faith may want to read these books before letting their younger children read them to decide if they're appropriate. Older children (12 and up) should be able to decipher Pullman's motivations on their own, and, as mentioned, these books can serve as a useful vehicle in having a discussion with your kids on prejudice and faith.

B00000J6AG|5.0|Before this cd, I hated techno. I am a x-files fan to the day i die and on two of the best episodes of the seventh season Moby's music is playing \\"The sky is broken\\" and \\"My weakness\\" in the background and is the main theme of the drama. I love this cd, the beat of \\"Machete\\" is a noneforgeter, \\"Honey\\", \\"Find my baby\\", \\"Why does my heart feel so bad?\\", \\"Natural blues\\" and \\"Run on\\" have a jazzy blues to it. And \\"If thing were perfect\\" makes me want to dance in the moon light. All the songs on this cd are very powerful and you'll catch yourself hymming them all day.
B00003W8NM|2.0|I hated this film. I use the word &quot;hated&quot; because I was having such a great time watching it, and then there's this ridiculousy unfortunate ending that does a horrible diservice to the rest of the material.

0920668372|5.0|The first time I saw this book, it was while I was a reading tutor in a summer program at an elementary school. At the end of each tutoring session, kids got to pick a book off the shelf that we would read together. This was a favorite. <br />The first time I read it, it was out loud to a 2nd grader - by the time I finished it was all I could do not to cry, and I had the same reaction with each reading (which was several - kid's choice!). The kids did not have the same reaction as I did - they all thought it was a sweet story that showed how much the mom loved the son, but without the added lump in the throat that comes from knowing how much things change as you get older.<br />The 'creepiness' that one reader wrote about - well - it is a kid's book - it's not REAL! <br />I just bought the book as a read-aloud book for our new baby.
B00005NGZX|5.0|First of all, i'am going to take an unbiased opinion because converge is my all time favorite band. let me just say that anything you think that you have heard is heavy fails to compare with Jane Doe in so many ways its not even funny. Jacob bannon's ear shredding vocals which are absolutely inhuman ( they seem to have gotten higher pitched from PTES) will leave you wondering how anyone can sing like that and still be able to talk. Kurt and aaron have stepped up the guitars into what i think a new sound, not as heavy as past cd's but faster and catchier, and obviously more skill is involved than past cd's. This may very well be the heaviest cd ever to come out, and probably will be for a very long time. Jane Doe has my vote for the best Cd of all time. GET THIS CD NOW you will not regret it. The ONLY downside i think the cd has is not exactly with the cd but the package. The cover of the cd slip is totally original and just shows us again that converge is a very artistic band. However, the art in the liner notes seem kind of repetitve and if you must know the lyrics to songs ( Jacob can be hard to understand in songs) than you will find no help in the notes. The lyrics are kind of scrambled, and covered up in places by the art, which doesn't really bother me ( i found the lyrics elsewhere) but for people who must know the lyrics might find it frustrating trying to put the songs together. All in all this is the best metal/ hardcore album i have heard to date. Whatever you ignore the reviews that converge is now a Death metal band, converge is not even on the same level as 99% of other metal acts. Jane Doe might turn off mainstream kids who listen to what the call metal i.e.slipknot, mudvayne.. and might find Jane Doe's sound not to their mainstream recorded studio sound. but to us Converge Fans, thisi s their best work to date, and was well worht the wait. I only hope Converge keep putting out the best of quality music that they have for so long.

Dont listen to a word that Fred has to say, listen to what Wes is belting out on his custom made guitar. Im just glad he didn't leave bizkit when they made this album. All credit to Wes, John, Lethal and Sam, sorry did someone say Fred Durst was on this album, sorry but all I can hear is bomb ass bass, scrath-tables and unreal guitar vibes from the living legend Wes.
0064409422|5.0|This book is one of the best, it is about good and evil and how love can get you though anything!

But if you love Fantasy and wonder then you shoudl read this book!
0380788624|3.0|Cryptonomicon is a very terse, technical, challenging, mind consuming novel.  If the length doesn't frighten you away, the details may.  Full of techno-talk, crossing generations, and incredible attention to precision, it was a little tiring at times.  There was a lot to keep track of and I felt that perhaps the two generations could have been split into two different novels to fully explore each set of protagonists and give them their own forums.  However, Stephenson definitely has something here and it's definitely fascinating and captivating.  Be sure to leave plenty of open time in you schedule for this one!
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is SUCH a good movie!  It follows the book closly without cutting so many parts and good characters! (Unlike Kavik....)  They chose all the characters very well!!! I don't think any movie as close to this has so many special effects!
B000050XEI|5.0|It's been a long time since I've heard anything this good.  I just can't stop listening over and over.  One by One is exceptional, so beautiful and moving.  There isn't a single song on this CD that doesn't rate a 5. Most of them rate a 9.  So moving and emotional.  Can't say enough good things.  A definate hit.
B000000WCV|4.0|Now first of all, I'm the kind of guy who likes just about any music. There's probably at least one artist in every genre that I like. But for every band that I love to listen to, there's a hundred others like it that I can't stand.<br />What's the difference? I've thought about this for a long, long time, and I've come up with one word: Groove. Groove is the difference. To me, groove is the undefinable ability of a composer to find a collection of sounds that, despite anything else that can be said about it, is simply fun to listen to. It's the kind of music that gets stuck in your head because it's so gosh-darn cool that you just can't help yourself. Any band that can groove will probably be great. Any band that can't never will.<br />This album proves that to make great music, you don't need the most hi-tech equipment, you don't need a whole lot of musical talent, you don't need more than a few instuments, but if you can put them together with groove, your songs will be catchy, cool, and oh-so-intoxicating. Daft Punk (which is arguably a fairly untalented group as far as the usual standards go) has certainly accomplished that with Homework - - sometimes I'll turn on &quot;Around the World&quot; or &quot;Da Funk&quot; and let it repeat for hours on end because, although it's the same thing over and over and over, it's such a cool groove that I keep wanting to hear more of it!<br />Grab this little gem and pop it in every so often to remind you that great music is more about how it makes _you_ feel than about whether or not the music is surprising or repetitive, tweaked or raw, talented or hacked.<br />Is this album high-quality stuff? No. Does it groove? You bet your toosh it does!
B0000067L2|4.0|On this album, the Cream are absolute masters of making a melody fit the emotional meaning expressed by the lyrics. (Did Jack Bruce write most of these songs?) I wonder if it's ever been done any better than this in the history of rock. Nothing fancy, but solid all the way through. And every song is so very different -  they cover alot of musical/emotional/poetic ground, and it's no secret how well they play and sing, and have a really good time doing it.<br />Note: &quot;Mother's Lament&quot; is not your typical rock song (what, no guitars?!?!), but a number of British bands had a similar sounding old dance hall number on their '67 album releases. The Stones had &quot;On With the Show&quot;, Procol Harum had &quot;Mabel&quot;, the BeeGees had &quot;Craise Fenton Kirk&quot;, and the Beatles &quot;Mr. Kite&quot; and &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot;, all with honky-tonk piano, and frequently vocals being sung through a megaphone. The Beatles mined this somewhat quirky trend even more on their 'White Album' a year or so later. It's good stuff, just not what modern American rockers are quite used to.<br />At this point in time my favorites on 'Disraeli Gears' are probably &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, &quot;World of Pain&quot;, and the other more darkly moody songs &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot; and &quot;We're Going Wrong&quot;. But all the songs definitely chug along. &quot;Blue Condition&quot; may not seem profound to some, but it feels really good to listen to, with a great overall sound. I've always thought it's a great song [and I guess I've always really enjoyed Cream's overall sound].<br />I'd have to say that the only song I don't like too much is &quot;Outside Woman Blues&quot;. Still, it's pleasant enough, and fits in with the general flow.<br />Cream took tendencies expressed in somewhat immature form on this album and purveyed them into the much more powerfully expressive and poetically mature 'Wheels of Fire'. But that's a whole different chapter.<br />[Note: anyone having trouble understanding the meaning of &quot;but the picture has a mustache&quot; could have your problem cleared up by taking Freshman English at a reputable college or university in your area. And please, no offence is here intended.]>[Note: anyone having trouble understanding the meaning of &quot;but the picture has a mustache&quot; could have your problem cleared up by taking Freshman English at a reputable college or university in your area.

014028009X|5.0|This is not the story of a self-obsessed whiner, but rather an honest woman attempting to find love and happiness. Her roller coaster dieting, attempts to quit smoking, and self-conscious wit keep the reader intrigued from beginning to end. <br />If you like books like the &quot;Ya-Ya Sisterhood,&quot; and &quot;Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing,&quot; you'll love this one.
B00005QCYC|4.0|This box set is great, all the movies are wonderful. Subtitles are great, better than most. Extras in each dvd movie disc are very good, especially the \\"Making of\\". This brings me to the fourth disc, I agree, it is a nice feature to include a fourth disc with extras to accompany the movies, but I was expecting more. The fourth disc seems to include all the extras that were not included in the movie discs because they are not quality material. The fourth disc is a collection of failed extras excluded from the standard movie discs. This fact alone forces me to take of one star, of this 5 star movie collection.
B00003XACV|5.0|This CD should have been subtitled \\"Songs to Make Love to.\\" From the moment it arrived on my doorstep it has been one of my favorites, due to it's unique ability to reach a listener at their very heart, and make them feel like they've just seen the most beautiful thing the universe has to offer. Although it's fairly short, every single song is of the highest quality.<br />A word of warning, however: be prepared to spend an hour doing nothing the first time you put this CD on. This is music that needs to be listened to, that needs to have the rest of the house silent. In a way, for me at least, this CD is a sort of meditation technique - - I put it on and just let the pure, deep beauty of the music wash over me, from the amazing groove of \\"Dead Already\\" and \\"Still Dead,\\" to the smooth waves of sound of \\"Arose,\\" \\"Power of Denial,\\" \\"Bloodless Freak,\\" and \\"Marine,\\" to quiet, gentle pieces like \\"Structure and Discipline\\" and the oh-so-breathtaking \\"Walk Home,\\" to the slightly more upbeat and humorous \\"Mr. Smarty-Man\\" and \\"Lunch With the King,\\" to the eerie, arhythmic percussion of \\"Root Beer\\" and \\"Choking the Bishop,\\" to the most beautiful piano playing ever on \\"Angela Undress,\\" \\"Mental Boy,\\" \\"Any Other Name,\\" and the title track, \\"American Beauty.\\"<br />Any one of these pieces alone would be worth the price of the disc. You can listen to this music once and feel like you've reached a higher plane of existence. Without a doubt, this is one of the three or four best purchases I have ever made. I will be keeping this CD until the day I die, and I will be loving it every day until then.
B000003Z12|5.0|Nothing short of AMAZING! Neal is just the MASTER of combining guitar licks you WISH you wrote/played in the context of songs you also wish you wrote! This is a beautiful album! As an artist...this album epitimizes what I aspire for in my own work. Keep it comin' Neal!
B00005RYQO|5.0|This is definitly my favorite movie! It is action packed and has a little humor in it as well. If you are into cars, then this movie is like heaven for you. <br />This movie is basically based on trust and illegal street-racing. The technology in these cars are unbelieveable, and the stunts that are performed are mind-boggling. <br />I have never seen so much \\"interesting\\" action in one scene in my life. I saw this movie twice in the theaters, and I bought the DVD the first day. <br />Some of these cars would be anyone's dream car, but each car gets better than the previous. Whether it's the Green Eclipse or the Honda Civics.<br />This movie is about an undercover cop who joins a racing team in order to find out who has been robbing tractor-trailers for their electronics...<br />Overall, the plot is a 3 but the action/special effects are a 5+. The cars in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen in my life. I think that this movie is more for the younger crowd, it appeals to us more than adults.
B0000507PC|3.0|Yes the film has a lot to say about abortion.  But as that's clearly not all it's about, and as most of the reviews below are as full of propaganda as the movie they're complaining about, let's leave that issue and just focus on the film.<BR>The first half is great.  The orphanage scenes are really well done, capturing the mix of companionship and loneliness that all the children feel.  Michael Caine is lovable and charismatic as Dr. Wilbur Larch, and his accent's not too bad.  Tobey Maguire is a bit monotone unfortunately, but I guess that's the character.  The kids as a whole are great.<BR>The problems are in the second half, when Maguire's character Homer leaves the orphanage to become an apple picker and \\"discover life.\\"  This is also when the film becomes formulaic, drawn out, and frankly boring.  Charlize Theron is completely charmless as Candy, the girl that Homer's in love with, and the whole incest angle which unfolds between the head apple-picker and his daughter (that's not giving much away, it's just annoying) is completely contrived just to tie Homer's moral dilemma up nicely, as is what happens to Candy's real fiance, who is away at war for most of the film.  Still, the first half is excellent, and leaves me wishing that Homer had never left the orphanage.
6300216047|5.0|I remember vividly the first time I saw that film. It was in 1978 and I was only 10 years old. I was trying to find something to watch on television and then, saw the first scene at the beginning where a woman in a space suit strips, ending up completely nude. The scene begins as the space \\"bubble\\" on her head gradually lowers, revealing Barbarella's face for the first time. Breathtaking is not strong enough a word. In my opinion, she was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen up until that time and I was instantly hooked.<br />The combination of the music, which is also a very strong element here, in total harmony with the highly satirical tone not to mention those cheesy sets are all dead-on perfect. Everything was put there to create a world where a highly sensual creature like Barbarella could flourish. Jane really knocked all my senses in terms of feminine beauty in this movie. She looks like some living Barbie doll, with breathtaking features and a gorgeous mane of thick blond hair: the perfect sex kitten always eager and ready for sex.<br />This is a truly wonderful performance from a great actress. She deliberately plays the character as a \\"bimbo\\" while letting the audience in on the joke. Here is this very intelligent woman playing some \\"nymphet\\" in the most convincing way possible.  She ends up sleeping with practically every man she encounters even though the sex is only suggested through some clever images. And all the while, she lets the audience knows in very subtle ways that she's acting in parody mode.  That is probably the most interesting aspect of her performance. Even with simple lines like \\"Oh\\", \\"But that's monstrous!\\", \\"That's nice\\", she succeeds in delivering them completely \\"straight\\" with just the right amount of tackiness as if to say \\"don't take any of this seriously, just have a good time...\\". There are countless classic lines here and I can admit I know them all by heart.<br /> Roger Vadim who also transformed another former wife \\"Brigitte Bardot\\" into a sensation in 1957 with \\"And God Created Woman\\", did the same trick some 10 years later with Jane. \\"Barbarella\\" is an erotic comedy disguised as a bad sci-fi movie. Everything in it is tacky: the clothes, the sets, the plot, the acting... But the big difference between this and a truly bad movie is that it is tacky \\"on purpose\\". Therefore, it becomes a camp movie which defined itself as such before any critic could do it. Roger knew exactly what he was doing and succeded on every front.<br /> I must say it is in my top ten list of my favorite movies of all times. I have seen it at least 50 times over the years and for some reason, the movie easily bears the repeated viewings. Sure, the story might seem quite silly to some but that's beside the point. If you view this on the first level, you will probably find it all quite ridiculous and farfetched to the extreme. But if you look at it closer, you'll realize just how well-conceived it is. I won't tell you about the plot as I feel it has been covered already in previous reviews. The plain fact is that the story mainly serves the purpose of displaying Jane as Barbarella in all her youthful glorious beauty in one skimpy costume after another.<br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. If you like camp movies, you will love this one. And even if you don't usually enjoy fanfares created for no other purpose than to entertain the hell out of us, you can at least bask in Jane Fonda's beauty here seen at the age of 29. Just for the chance to stare at that perfect face and body is worth the price alone.rigitte Bardot\\" into a sensation in 1957 with \\"And God Created Woman\\", did the same trick some 10 years later with Jane. \\"Barbarella\\" is an erotic comedy disguised as a bad sci-fi movie.

B00005AUBA|4.0|I agree with the compliants of reviewers who paid LP money for such a short album (only ten miuntes longer than a single GSYBE! track)  but since i got it for free i can't complain. Anyway i like albums with around 7-9 tracks because you tend to listen to each one in depth whereas on albums with 18 songs, songs that you don't like on first or second listening are qucikly disgarded.<br /> If you listen to this just after listening to 'Come On Die Young' you will hear a lot of similarities but Rock Action has built upon this. It is slightly darker, there is more use of the bass drum, it isn't as sparse and is probably more mainstream but don't expect to listen to it on commercial radio.<br /> Three of the tracks have got vocals which are quite good bar the last track which is the albums only poor track. Many 'mainstream' listeners think that a proper song has to include vocals and can't be more than four minutes long, and thats why they are classed as 'mainstream' listeners. However if Mogwai continue to increase the number of vocal tracks and keep tracks at 4 minutes length they could be shifting towards the mainstream. They only had one vocal track on Come On Die Young.<br /> Overall this is a very important album and provides the listener with much pleasure. <br /> PS It is best listened to on a cold night while in bed with the lights off and the sound up.

0345451325|5.0|Eric Nylund is a writer of previous sf/fantasy novels that feature inventive ideas and fast-paced adventure.  This book is no exception and could have easily been the first book of a new military sf series rather than a game prelude.  Not to take anything away from the game, but this book can stand alone as a fun and engaging sf novel.  If you liked this book, definitely check out his novel Signal to Noise.  If you've liked Nylund's previous books, don't be concerned that this is a media-tie-in book, get it anyway.
B00005NWM3|4.0|I wouldn't care if these guys lived in Seattle, or, liked coffee. Some of you people let the stupidest things determine whether or not you like music. I think I'll let the musianship, the lyrics, and performance decide. This, the second effort from Nickelback, has only one weakness. That being only 10 songs and just barely 40 minutes worth of music. I was begining to think this was the time where you got more.<br />The disc is full of raw guitar and screaming vocals. There is intensity in virtually every track. The onslaught starts off with &quot;Never Again&quot; and &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, which show two sides to the band, but both should end up being hits, unless &quot;Too Bad&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot; leave them far behind. A fifth track, &quot;Look What Your Money Bought&quot; is also a good tune. There isn't any filler on this disc, just what could have been up to 30 to 40 more minutes of music!<br />If teen angst doesn't frighten you, if you don't mind being on the edge, if you can live with walk and talk rhymes, and you don't mind a little excitement and passion, SILVER SIDE UP could be a CD that will bring a little sunshine into your life.

B000000Y1H|5.0|While many refer to Kind of Blue as jazz's greatest, I thoroughly believe that even that masterpiece is topped by the sheer genius that is Brilliant Corners.  While KoB is cool and pleasant, BC is a rollercoaster ride of emotional tumult.  It's an album about discovery of things in life, both large and small.  It is introspective and honest, unlike KoB.<BR>  But enough of comparisons.  How's it technically?  The answer is, in a word, brilliant.  Monk's piano is beautifully earnest, while at the same time playful.  Roach's drumming is jammin'.  Everyone involved plays their hearts out.<BR>  I highly recommend this album.  Buy it.
006016848X|1.0|I bought my book second hand and it was not worth the $4.50. If you were to take the content to heart, you might believe the only way for men and women to get along would be to not talk to each other at all. According to Gray, women should not ever correct a man, give him advice, her opinion, or make unreasonable requests - such as taking out the garbage. Are you kiddding me? If I didn't know it was written during my lifetime, I would assume it was a 1950s home economics primer on how to be a good housewife. If these ridiculous stereotypical statements were true, then I'd actually be a man (which I'm not). As others have said, the author is irritatingly repetitive. Perhaps he was trying to fulfill a publisher's word count requirement, but it makes it difficult to get through - I found myself reading the first paragraph and skipping ahead to the next section. I kept hoping I'd find something better in the next chapter--no such luck. It could have been a very funny book based on the underlying premise that men and women behave, react and communicate differently. It was not at all enjoyable.
0553213105|5.0|In comparison to Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Pride and Prejudice is a refreshing romance comedy which brings to life the humor of 18th century society.  Jane Austen's style is so stellar.  She leaves nothing unsettled or unhappy.  They way each character is tied in with the plot is amazing, from Mr. Collins and charlotte's marriage, which brings Elizabeth to lady Catherine and Darcy, to the Gardeners transaction with Darcy during the chase for Lydia, proving Darcy's love for Elizabeth.  Jane is a sweet character and Bingly is her perfect match.  Darcy and Elizabeth as well are the epitome of romance.  Elizabeth cannot marry anyone she cannot love, and to her, love is someone who she can connect with on all levels.  When she and Darcy fight, it should only be taken as a sign of their compatibility because she is not afraid to answer him and he enjoys it. Lydia and Mrs. Bennet are incredibly irritating, however they do add to the satirical style of the novel, as Mrs. bennet's sole desire in life has to do with marriage, her own and her daughters.  She and Mr Bennet do not share a true love because he married her for her beauty, and now must learn to live with her stupidity.  Lydia as well makes a mistake in who she marries.  She is too naive to understand that Wickham had no desire to marry her in the first place.  She considers the whole ordeal a game, not realizing the gravity of the situation she has put her family in, ruin and disgrace.  Bingly's sisters take on the &quot;wicked step sister&quot; act in trying to keep Bingly from Jane and Elizabeth from Darcy.  Charlotte Lucas is an extraordinary character simply because her theories on love are profound and true for the time period.  Good book, I enjoyed it.
B00000099Y|5.0|When I bought this album, after hearing several hit songs<BR>from it on the radio, like H, Eulogy, Stinkfist, 46&2, and<BR>AEnema, I was ABSOLUTELY dumbfounded listening to how great<BR>Keenan's vocals are and how much (...) these guys kick!<BR>The opening song, Stinkfist, sounds sort of like a subtle,<BR>watery twang at the first few seconds, but be warned: the<BR>creepy guitar riffs getting further into the song in the<BR>first few seconds sound NOTHING like Metallica(...).<BR>They WILL get any first timer nervous!!!  Eulogy is also<BR>an EXCELLENT song, with a \\"bomp\\" noise during the first few<BR>minutes.  This song is what got me addicted to Tool so badly<BR>and this is possibly their best song on the whole damn CD!!!<BR>ALL of the other songs(even the stupid even number tracks like<BR>\\"Useful Idiot\\") are catchy and will REALLY get your head shakin'!!!!!!!  Buy it now!!!
B000001E18|5.0|I had read SO many bad reviews of Zooropa, so when I finally went out and bought this album, it was only because I wanted to add to my (admittedly still quite pitiful) U2 collection. But from the opening of the very first track, Zooropa, to the very end of this album, I was gasping at its brilliance. <BR>This CD is not traditional U2, and I can understand why some fans would not like this as much as their previous, more sing-along work. However, their expectations seem to get too much in the way of the fact that this still is a wonderful album, and if this was a debut CD by any other group, the critics would still be praising it.<BR>I do think Zooropa was an excellent follow-up to Achtung Baby, because they took one of the best ideas from A.B, that awesome falsetto chorus from The Fly, and made an entire CD which is just as strange (and great.)<BR>Other songs on this album do sound more traditional than the weirdest songs, Lemon and Numb, but they just as brilliant, especially the title track. I also love the final track, which Johnny Cash sings on.  The Wanderer is an amazing song, and his voice is just perfect for it.  The only problem I have with this CD is Stay, because it is a beautiful song, but the backing just seems too cold, especially after hearing far warmer versions.<BR>Anywho, this CD is still amazing.<BR>DO BUY IT.
B00000IFWE|2.0|Despite what a lot of other people and critics say, I LOVED Wildflowers, which has become one of my mandatory Desert Island discs.  I also think that Tom and the boys are legendary stuff as attested to by their long and highly productive career of seriously significant tunes.  However, I was really looking forward to Echo, but kept falling asleep during most of it, despite one or two tracks that try very hard to be vintage Petty or hit some of the notes on his newer directions like 'You Wreck Me' did on Wildflowers.  As a loyal TP fan, can't garbage this album, but when you compare it to Wildflowers, and then some of the fantastic old material released on the recent Anthology 2 CD set, Echo becomes instantly forgettable.  Don't worry Tom, you can't be truly legendary all the time, looking forward to the next one.
0767849493|4.0|I dont like to wirte reviews, but I just needed to get this written down. I think DOGMA was a good movie. <br />First let me explain...<br />You all think way too much while watching the movie. Well it was quite clever in some ways, but it's still a comedy. <br />I think that Kevin Smith did a good job wirting this piece of movie. It makes us think...<br />I admit it that I had at first a hard time liking it. I even though that it was unclever! But 2hours ago, as I rewatched it I liked it more. And I know why... I just turned off my premade opinions and watched it. It made me see some things diffrent. And isnt that what this film was all about?<br />Vulgar language is unfortunaly  a part of our society, but DOGMA is a part of our society therefore it  had to contain such language. Still I understand that people are offended by it. My only advise for you, who are offened by this kind of language, you might not want to see this movie.<br />Well and for all catholic people out there:<BR>This movie is of course a bit offending. Well maybe highly offending. Maybe it had to be.. to just get you out of your old thinking. I am NOT saying that your way of thinking is wrong.

0790736039|4.0|\\"It\\"!  A killer clown that goes around biting the arms off small children. Sounds weird? Sure. However, years later after a group of children win the first battle, the clown played by Tim Curry (who is even more scary in Home Alone 2, whenever he smiles) goes on another rampage and battles the kids, now grown-ups<BR>As they're called back to stop the menace, It.  The mêlée is on, with a flying clown, blood filled balloons, disembodied talking heads, and the usual fun of Stephen King's psychoses all around.<br />It's a pretty good movie. However, I think the ending was disappointing.  It seemed to have been written at the last minute.  In other words, patched together with lint, hair, and some chewing gum (the book was better).   <br />The Master of Horror Unleashes everything you were afraid of.  And it's true, only Mr. King could write something like this.  In the way of that his books are so well written, they are in a way written as if you were thinking the words yourself.  Does that make any sense?

B00005QDW1|1.0|What a load of ...- this isn't music, this is a lot of people (who can't \\"sing\\") who just want to say \\"hey baby\\" over and over and over and over... I highly recommend that you DO NOT BUY THIS! I have not listened to any other No Doubt CDs, and, judging from this one, I don't intend to any time soon.
B000050XEI|5.0|This cd is simply stunning, I love it! It's so peaceful. It is great to listen to when relaxing, reading a book, doing chores etc. This is one of Enya's best works of art. She has a beautiful voice that fills your ears like the sound of bright spring day (enchanting). If a twelve year old likes it so will you. So trust me when I say there will be no regrets to purchasing this cd you'll probably buy more of her works!
B00005UEAR|3.0|Well, when I bought this CD, I was semi-prepared as to what I was expecting, since I had read a few reviews here.  The basic mentality I had was, first CD ok, but could be better.  Second CD very good.  I have to say that basically says it.  The first disc isn't bad, it's pretty good actually.  However, they could have done better.  Some of the songs tend to drag on a bit, and thats not good, since I know these guys can make good long songs.  The actual playing and singing is good, it's DT, but there is just something that isn't there, that makes the first disc only par.<br />THe second disc, however, is incredible.  from the overture to the finally, it is just constantly flowing.  Not once am I thinking &quot;ok, so when is this ending?&quot;  The orchestration is great.  Everything just goes together very well.  In my opinion, this is definately one of their better works.<br />The final verdict: A solid album.  The first disc could be better, but it still is quality listening.  The second disc, however, makes the purchase more than worth it.  The 3 stars is a rough average of the ratings I would give to both discs, rather than both as a whole.

0060977493|5.0|Once, every now and then, I read a book that feels so powerful that I wonder how could I have lived before -- without knowing this story -- and not be aware of the void within?  The God of Small Things is one such book.  Extraordinary language carried me through.  A masterful narration permitted horrible events to unfold in such a way that I was eager to see them through.   What makes this novel great, greater than most,  is that it is not only a story about India in the 1960s, about her caste system, or about Western colonialism.  This story is about us, human beings with  follies, and many cruelties.  And it is also about our love, our need for love that more often than not is out of synchrony with our lives.  It shows us the difference between a world seen through children's eyes and that of adults.  How we corrupt ourselves as we grow into maturity, although sometimes it happens as abruptly as in the twin's lives in Ms. Roy's novel.<br />I can't add anything else here that more than 400 reviewers have not said; I would have to dissect this book, and I don't feel  comfortable doing it because I don't want to break its spell.   <BR>Suffice it to say, it is an extraordinary novel.

B00003CXMG|4.0|In the year 2000 a number of fabulous films were made. 'Traffic, Gladiator, and the film that came from nowhere; 'Almost Famous'. <br />The film is a slightly autobiographical tale of Cameron Crowe's teenage life. As he went around the U.S writing reviews for 'Rolling Stone' magazine. As our young protagonist William ventures around the country with a up, and coming rock band 'Stillwater' The film is essentially a comedy, but has moments of drama and romance ribboned through it's highly lucid and entertaining storyline.<br />The performances in 'Almost Famous' are flawless leading the charge with brilliant performances by Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson the film can appeal to a variety of age levels and lovers of the era.<br />Through Crowe's masterful directing the audience are subjected to a wild ride of sex, drugs and rock and roll. The viewer can experience what life is like in the late 60's and how each of us deals with fame. A tour de force soundtrack again allows the audience to feel this lifestyle.<br />Overall the film is an utter triumph, one that is unsurpassed in scope and vision. In a year that was dominated by 'Gladiator' which was a genre peice it was great to see a big film with a 'small film' feel. It's multiplicity of genres to allow the film to convey this feeling.

B00005RHGK|4.0|Jeepers Creepers. When I first heard the title of this film and saw the teeny bopper cast from the promos, I was pretty sure this film would be a waste of time. But, then a funny thing happened. I started to hear from friends who said Jeepers Creepers was really scary and I read an endorsement on the newspaper ad from the &quot;master&quot; Clive Barker who said &quot;...The Scariest Film I've Seen in Years.&quot; That was enough for me. The film doesn't waste much time getting right into the plot which is good. The plot is also very basic, a brother and sister driving home along the backroads from college. They are menaced off the road by a maniac in an old fashioned car. After surviving the scare of their lives, the loony drives away and the kids think all is well. As they continue driving they spot the maniac's truck at an abandoned old church. They see the guy chucking what appears to be bodies into a sewer drain. The story progresses well from here incorporating elements of the supernatural and standard horror. The director of Jeepers Creepers is the true star of the film. You can tell he is an avid fan of the genre and knows exactly what buttons to push to scare the hell out of you. The last scene is pretty grizzly but one that will stick with you every time you mention the film hereafter. Overall, great direction and some scary moments add up to a worthy addition to any horror collection.

B00003CXI1|5.0|I was never interested in any of the books But wen The Movie came out I thought it looked good So I went and seen it with my dad and WOW WHAT A GREAT MOVIE. It tells the story of a boy who is adopted by foster parents who are very mean to hem and do not let hem know anything about his real parents. Or who he really is. But one day he gets a lot of letters that his foster parents try to keep from hem. That are invitations to Hogwarts, a school for young witches and wizards. And wen there Harry finds out that he is someone who is very special and is treated like a Celebritiy because of what happened to his real mom and dad wen he was just a bady. <BR>Both me and my dad really enjoyed this movie and we both are over 18. there are some very deep stuff in it that  makes you think about. Like a Mirror that some people go mad wail looking in to that shows them what they want the most. And some other stuff that make you think<br />I don't understand why Lord of The Rings fans are saying bad things about this movie I am also a Lord of The Rings fan and I thought both movies were great
B00005RHGL|4.0|It can be said of \\"Tombstone\\" that it is a perfect model of the Western genre. As someone with little knowledge of this certain group of movies, or of the history and fact surrounding the characters in writer Kevin Jarre's story, I'm not about the begin to praise or denounce the film on the basis of what is truth and what is fabrication. I simply wish to comment on the wondrous sense that a long-forgotten era of movie-making seems to have been resurrected to the screen in this near-perfect spectacle of gun-slinging and rousing action. <br />Once again telling the well-known story of legendary Wyatt Earp, the films casts Kurt Russell in the main role as the now-retired sheriff reunited with his two brothers, Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton). Accompanied by their wives, the brothers journey to Tombstone, where they hope to find peace and begin their lives anew, devoid of the perils of policing town after town.<br />The film's first hour is devoted to much of the character development, and while this is usually a good thing, it tends to test one's patience with the film. We learn that Earp's new wife suffers from a drug addiction, that which keeps him from living out his married life as he wishes to. This calls for the presence of a new love interest, arriving in the form of actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney); unfortunately, the movie doesn't expand much on her interaction with Earp, and their scenes together seem muddled and misplaced. <br />Of course, throughout this wallow in seemingly endless boredom, the film has two things going for its first half: the meticulous production design, and the establishment of the cast's willingness to throw themselves into their roles with full vigor. \\"Tombstone\\" vividly recreates the Old West in a manner that pays homage to the Westerns decades before, from the single street lined by houses, hotels, and saloons, to the dry, arid feel of living in these territories. <br />The introduction of its many characters provides a new entrance by another actor in an all-star ensemble cast, with Russell and Val Kilmer leading the way. Russell gives perhaps the best performance of his still-unfinished career as Earp, making the transition from a man who wants no more violence to a brother bent on exacting justice with impressive conviction. Kilmer plays the eccentric Doc Holliday with a terrific panache and humorous wit; together with Elliott and Paxton, the four form a lethal force of unrelenting justice seekers. <br />As the movie moves into its second half, things begin to pick up speed, gaining momentum with the introduction of the ruthless band of renegades known as The Cowboys, who see fit to create a ruckus throughout Tombstone that disturbs the peace Earp so desperately needs in life. pleading with his brothers to stay out of the affairs of the law, he is reluctant to take up arms against these men, though a stormy night and a dead brother provides him enough emotional anguish to create an uprising against the Cowboys and wipe them out once and for all. <br />It's material like this that director George P. Cosmatos excels at. His character development is well-guided, though throughout much of the first half, I wasn't feeling the vibes that I felt I should be. Once the first shots were fired in a spectacular shootout that begins their bloody feud, I was completely enamored by the various sequences of gunplay, which never fail to dazzle the eyes with an authentic sense of realism and historical accuracy in terms of appearance. <br />Once Earp begins to take his stand, which ends with a grandly-executed stand-off sequence at O.K. Corral, \\"Tombstone\\" proves its worth as a modern envisioning of a legendary figure. Some will quibble about its historical accuracy, while others will embrace it wholeheartedly. To be honest, I enjoyed the movie's wonderful energy and realistic depiction of the Old West, which was almost more than enough to make me overlook the shortcomings that befall itsbeginning.
0375420525|5.0|There's a fine line between great art and magnificent, devouring psychosis, and I wouldn't want to bet upon which side the author is going to wind up.  The novel is a multilayered absinthe cake of a horror story about the Navidsons -  a family who find they live in a house that sprouts hallways to nowhere and then to terrible infinite nowhere for no reason at all. Their story is supposedly researched by a blind man, collected and organized by a gen-x drifter with a psychotic mother and footnoted to the eyeteeth with imaginary and almost believable references.  Obsessional concern with lists and pseudophilosophical &quot;quotes&quot; abound. The author spent several months at the end making his text look like the horrible empty maze that he describes. Text can appear anywhere at any angle. There is a page written in Braille.  The word &quot;house&quot; and all its translations appear in grey or another color, depending upon what edition you have.  No reason, they just do.<br />The book has been favorably compared with Pynchon's towering work &quot;Gravities Rainbow&quot; but it's a little of Pynchon, a little of 'Dude, Where's My Car' and a little of Poe (Edgar Allen, not the author's performance artist/musician sister, who, of course, wrote a CD of music to accompany House of Leaves).<br />You won't like this book if you enjoy a conventional novel or even an eerie Steven King piece like the Langoliers. You'll like this book if you like huge complex novels, great literature and perhaps psychotic art.  It's a magnificent toxic obsession of a book and it's amazing that Mark Z. Danielewski was able to remain tied to reality long enough to write it.  It's not a book that he will ever be able to top because there's nowhere to go from this razor-sharp pinnacle but down.  Doesn't matter. Five stars doesn't even come close. It's Armstrong on the Moon playing Jimi Hendrix while trying to read the time from Dali's plastic clocks.  Amazing.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|I have always been a fan of Sade and their music.  I have every CD from &quot;Diamond Life&quot; to &quot;Lover's Rock&quot;.   However, there is nothing like seeing a live Sade performance.   On August 24, 2001, I saw Sade, along with India Arie at Nissan Pavillion.   The concert was out of this world.   India Arie did a good concert but everyone that was at the concert was waiting for Sade to perform.  Once they reached the stage, Sade and company performed for almost 2 hours.   When I learned that a live CD and DVD were on the way, I was eagerly awaiting both.   The live CD does not disappoint at all.  Although, the CD was recorded from two live shows in California, you couldn't even tell the difference between California and The Nissan Pavillion when it comes to the sound.   I have been reading a few reviews and have a few comments to make:  First of all, the CD is called &quot;Lovers Live&quot;.  So that tells you right there that a lot of songs will come directly from &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;.   As a fan, I would have loved to hear &quot;Your Love Is King&quot;, &quot;Hang On To Your Love&quot; and other of her classics but as a Sade fan, I was not going to let that stop me from buying this live CD.  Then I am reading where some people are complaining about the crowd noise on the CD.   HELLO, it's a live CD.   What do you expect?  Sade has made a mark on r&amp;b music for life and when she hasn't toured in almost 10 years, how do you expect their fans to react.   Real fans of music, when they see one of their favorite bands, they will act accordingly and consumers should expect that.   &quot;Lovers Live&quot; gets off to a nice start with the 3rd single from the &quot;Love Deluxe&quot; CD, &quot;Cherish The Day&quot;.   I can't think of a better way to start a live CD.   The sound is great as Sade and company make wonders of this classic tune.   From there, what may have been the 3rd single from &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;, &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot; is track #2.   At the concert, the sounds coming from the band sound just like they were in the studio recording the &quot;Lover's Rock&quot; CD.   The song sounded the same way it did live that it did on the CD.   People need to realize that is not a bad thing.  If you went and saw your favorite artist and their voice was distorted and cracking then you would have something to complain about.   The sound overall was excellent, as well as, Sade Adu's voice.   The best 2 gems on this CD are clearly &quot;Jezebel&quot; and &quot;Is It A Crime&quot;.   &quot;Is It A Crime&quot; is worth the price of the CD and the concert by itself.  The arena was electrified while Sade Adu was singing this song and the same magic was captured on this CD.   This live CD is well worth your money.   If you are a fan of Sade then you would be making a mistake to not buy this CD.   Other highlights include &quot;Smooth Operator&quot;, &quot;Kiss Of Life&quot;, &quot;The Sweetest Taboo&quot;, &quot;By Your Side&quot; and &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot;.   I would have loved to hear &quot;King Of Sorrow&quot; on this live CD, but hey, you can't always get what you wish for.   If you purchased &quot;Lovers Live&quot; at Circuit City you will also be privleged to have the live versions of &quot;Immigrant&quot; and &quot;It's Only Love That Gets You Through&quot; as well on an included bonus disc.   This CD is a must buy in my opinion.
B00003CXN4|2.0|I saw a sneakpeek of this one shortly before it came out, and wow, was I not able to predict the way it would be received. Soderbergh shows a surprisingly uneven hand with his storylines. Del Toro is good, but he's been (and will be, no doubt) much better. Michael Douglas is, surprise surprise, Michael Douglas. And Zeta-Jones is not as deft an actress as she is stunning. Sorry, but it's true. My main problem with the film, however, has to do with the overall approach. It reminds me of Natural Born Killers, in which Oliver Stone tried to make a point about how popular culture makes us numb to violence by making a movie equally numbing. Interesting point, but not an enjoyable film experience. Similarly, Traffic seems to address the \\"the drug problem is really complex and seemingly unresolvable\\" idea by making a movie as muddy and tangled as its topic.
0140437711|5.0|THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES are here collected into a single volume in this Penguin edition. Two compediums of short stories published after the detective's introduction in the novels A STUDY IN SCARLET and THE SIGN OF FOUR, these are concise bits that are just as good a first exposure to Holmes as the novels.<br />Because the cases of Sherlock Holmes, dutifully chronicled by his companion Dr. Watson, may not appeal to everyone, I won't focus here on reviewing the stories themselves, as it is the features of this particular edition that are of note.<br />Iain Pears' introduction is quite enlightening, showing the tendency of Arthur Conan Doyle to make the troubles in Holmes' stories come from England's colonies, which is strange considering Conan Doyle's support of equality and respect for all peoples. Pears' also discusses the change in the style of the Holmes stories, from the rational youth of Conan Doyle to the latter days of his life when he was interested in spiritualism and mysticism.<br />There are footnotes to each story, compiled by Ed Glinert. An expert on literature set in London, Glinert explains the geographical settings of the Holmes stories, and defines anachronistic terms that are no longer use. He also points out the mistakes Arthur Conan Doyle frequently made in his stories, which are often quite amusing (Watson's wife calling him by the wrong name, contradicting timelines, etc).<br />Because of the illuminating introduction and the helpful footnotes, I'd recommend over any others this edition of THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES.

Try to have a few photos of Nicole Kidman nearby, too, to calm yourself down occasionally. To be fair, the film must have been a nightmare to make and edit, and Luhrmann has done an estimable job with that, but it's ultimately one of those experiments that I'm not sure anyone had to really make. If AMPAS had to give this film any Oscar attention, it should've acted in reverse. No nomination for Best Movie, but a nomination for Best Director.
B000002NIW|3.0|I picked this album up based solely on Amazon recommendations, along with Adrenaline.<br />When they arrived I listend to Adrenaline first, and then this album. While Around the Fur is a solid album with an overall strong sound it didnt measure up as well as Adrenaline to my ears.<br />My Own Summer (also on the MATRIX Soundtrack) is probably the strongest track on the CD. It also has a different sound than most of the other tracks on the album, unfortunately.<br />lhabia is a bit grating and gets old fast.<br />Mascara is an interesting track, starting off slow and slowly grinding up to a crescendo and then tapering off again. <br />The title track starts off good but then doesnt really go anywhere.<br />Rickets is sort of interesting, but screamed rather than sung.<br />Be Quiet & Drive is extremely cool, with a good grove.<br />Lotion starts off decent, but turns out to be a bile-filled rant set to music. Overall a weak track.<br />dai the flu is a distinctive and top-cut track. Very mellow but at the same time menacing.<br />head up features Max Cavalera of Sepultura/Soul Fly fame, but is rather disappointing. It sounds like someone is just shouting 'Soul Fly' repeatedly.<br />mx is kind of average, and wraps up the album.<br />All around not horrible but not as good as Adrenaline.
B000000JO3|5.0|Combining pure youth energy ( the guys we're as old as I am athe moment, 19, or so, when they started out) and clear and unapologetic oppinions and attitude with fresh and innovative hardcore, to me they are much more enjoyable to listen to, than the thick rumble of , say Black Flag, for example. \\"Straight Edge\\" , \\"Out Of Step\\" and \\"Filler\\" are driven by full energy and aggression and acknowlidging lyrics, while \\"In My Eyes\\" and the almost anthemic \\"Minor Threat\\" show that the goup was also capable of producing more alternating songs and had a sense of melody instead of being chained with full-on bursts of aggression. Their attitude and personal lifestyle formed a faithful following, \\"Straight Edge\\" being an anthem for clean lifestyle. This album is the only Minor Threat album you need, because this is ALL they did. Somehow you can't do with less than this, if you want to get to know them.
6302054982|5.0|If the \\"Godfather\\" films are your cup of tea, then you must see \\"Goodfellas\\"! Where the \\"Godfather\\" movies told the tale of gangster royalty, \\"Goodfellas\\" tells the story of the mob from a blue collar perspective. <br />The performances are spectacular, the dialogue is sharp, and the cinematography is breath-taking. And the soundtrack! Wow! Each song is perfectly chosen for its scene.<br />A phenomenal piece of film-making---possibly Scorsese's best work.
B00000BKDS|5.0|One might pressume Bruce Dickinson is the man that holds the keys to franchis Maiden. that is not the truth, however. In fact, this happens to be their second best effort. &quot;Running Free&quot;, &quot;Charlotte The Harlot&quot; and the title track are classic, straightforward heavy metal filled with raw energy sometimes lacking in Dickinson era songs, while &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Strange World&quot; prove that Maiden had a strong sense of sensibility right at the beginning. Di'Anno is not Dickinson, but he scores very well here, indeed. If you like Number Of The Beast and Piece Of Mind, do not heistate getting this one.
B000059POY|5.0|This was a 5 star production for my friends and I when, in 1969, we returned to the cinema time and time again for more viewings.<br />Can I get a version of Candy that will run on kit in the UK - DVD or video tape.<br />I couldn't find a regular email address for this query.
0446608955|5.0|This was such a sweet book.  I read it after I watched the movie and I can't decide which is better!! I cried throughout the book!  I would recommend it to anyone you is up for a good read!
B00000F1D3|5.0|The title song alone is worth the price of this CD. I own several MIDI versions as well and never get tired of listening to it. Always puts a smile on my face.<br /><br /> Cher is my heroine. She was 53 and supposedly &quot;washed out,&quot; but believed in herself and came out with a world famous dance tune ... unbelievable.
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch is by no means one of my favourite directors. The obscure trademarks we find synonymous with his style are by no means absent from this film. Why I personally found it so gripping and ergo satisfying, the enigmatic abilities of Naomi Watts are a device destined to revolutionise the scope of emotion that actresses are able to portray. Single handedly the character of Betty entices our delight with her mingled softness and ambition reducing our egos to minute status momentarily. In Comparison to Lost Highway, Lynch has obviously sat down and had a hard think about character development in this wonderfully crafted film, in some ways equally disjointed, however the plot flows in a comprehensible fashion for a substantial duration of two and a half hours. A decapitating head cut and paste effect is employed triggered by the linking of a blue key to a box, assumed to be an answer for a woman whom has seeked refuge under Bettys wing after and accident in the beginning that renders her experiencing amnesia. Not everyone will gladly feel comfortable with the questions concerning this piece that cannot be answered, but it is these non-sensical devises that strike a chord, for they are the climax and leave you flattened only to be left experiencing an extreme case of the \\"Kubrick chills\\",or at best wobbly knees as you proceed to exit the cinema. Lynch will never win the oscar for director, If he ever does, we should be afraid...very afraid!!!! SILENCIO- The Best of 2002!
6305531412|3.0|The content of the 1988 film is not at question here. Its blend of live action and animation in unprecedented to this day. (Space Jam? P-P-P-Please!) While the plot itself is choppy and cliche, the acting and animation direction (by animation great Richard Willaims) makes it a great film.<br />The DVD has much to be desired with no film notes, director's commentary, nor trailers. I was especially hoping to see the deleted scene in which Eddie Valiant breaks into Jessica's dressing room only to get knocked out by the bouncer and has an early dreadful encounter with Toontown that has only been shown once on a CBS airing of the film. Animation has been edited and redone in several places. Disney really needs to realize that they truly have a film gem here and stop placing it in the back burners of their achievements. Its truly more innovative than anything they've done in recent years before they fell into formula and saccharine characterization.
0671027379|1.0|Too many bodies to begin with. They drop like flys in this book! Implausible plot.  This was my first/last Dan Brown book<br />May I recommend &quot;The Price of Honor&quot;  by David H. Hackworth.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is one of those rare suprising films that takes all your expectations and throws them in a blender. This whirlwind of teenage 80's schitzo-angst is a treatise on every adolescent \\"outsider\\" and their own self-discovery. It takes the idea of justifying ones existence through self-sacrifice and blows it up a hundred-fold to very unique ends.<br />The acting (aside from Barrymore) is subtle and carried through with great care so as not to burden the audience with the state of being that these suburbanites are burdened with. Donnie himself as the center of the film (and later, the universe) is bit player to his own demise and the careful development of his coming to terms with death is like nothing I've ever seen on film. The script and pacing allow for real empathy especially in his therapy sessions where he uncovers the source of his dilemna. Sure, the film is flawed (again, Barrymore's character and some wierd plot devices) but the ride is one of the most original takes on that awkward point in each of our existences.<br />Stunning in every way a film should be.
B00003CXQX|5.0|I have to admit, when this Disney animated movie came out, I had no intention of seeing it.  Why?  David Spade.  He's just one of those guys that gets on my nerves so I try to avoid his work.  But when Emperor's New Groove came out on video, someone gave it to me as a gift, knowing I collect all the major Disney animated releases.<br />Well, I laughed and laughed a lot.  The story is simple, but hey, it's a kids movie.  But it is one the adults can enjoy.  I thought John GOodman also did a good job.
0345409671|4.0|I've read all of Anne Rice's Novels, excludiing Blood and Gold because it is not yet in paperback or in my local library.  Reading a few of the reviews I decided to give my perspective.<br />Interview and all the books after Memnoch are almost from a different series, barring Merrick which I find a little difficult to place in the scheme of things.  The Vampire Lestat through Memnoch are stories about Lestat.  They are not really about the other characters.  They are telling his story/stories.  Memnoch, I think, is a look inside Lestat's soul or lack there of.  Lestat's whole purpose has been to find truth, and draw attention to himself from everything and everyone.  All his previous adventures challenged God and the Devil to see him, to watch him.  In this novel he may have found the greatest of all truths or may not have.  This is not a religious treatsie and I feel it stays very true to the character of Lestat and her other novels.
B0000000LI|5.0|Truly, this is an amazing album. Prior to this album, I was not even aware who this wondrous composer was. Now, I am convinced that Yanni is among this millenium's greatest musical influences. The performance itself is a grand sight (and sound) to behold. I cannot explain the raw human emotions found within this stunning exhibition of explosive musical talent; one must experience it in order to believe it. I digress.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This is an example of totally inept filmmaking. However, impressionistic it is. My impression was that it was a good imitation of pseudo art-house fodder complete with affected acting and even less effective singing by its two stars. This is definitely not my parents' idea of a musical nor anyone else's of sound mind for that matter. To think that members of a certain organization even considered this film for any award belittles the very legitimacy of award giving in general.
0871137380|5.0|This is military history with a visceral punch. Bowden does a smart thing. He lets an extraordinary story tell itself by earning the trust of its participants and assiduously researching the rest. And my goodness what a story.<br />Very crispy retold. Social and political context is established but never belabored. The real story are the combatants and the battle. And that's the real thrust of this book.<br />Reminded me in some ways of Ambrose's D-Day book, though the scale of this conflict and logistical simplicity made it far easier to grasp. That, in my humble opinion, is why it connects with such a wallop.<br />The film is excellent as well.
B00005B36H|5.0|I just read the review from webmaster 1824. It was the exact same experience i have had with this album. i listened to it 2-3 times and thought it was o.k., but as i continued to listen, it completely blew me away. The music is brilliant. This could be the best hard/heavy rock album i have ever heard. you need to listen to it 6-7 times before it hits you. buy it. it is unbelievable! tracks 1 and 7 are two of the best heavy songs i have ever heard.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I first heard of this film, on like, May or April 2001, and i saw some clips in \\"Access Hollywood\\", and it had a stunning cinematography and great production design, unfourtanely i didn't catch it in theaters, so i waited for the DVD, i brought it the first day, and i just setted up the DTS track, and well for the first minute i was totally hooked!, the story is about Christian a 1900 writer who visits France to become part of the bohemian revolution (i am not sure if this was true), he meets at his apartment five bohemian revoloutinaries, one of them is Toulouse Lautrec, then they discover that he is the perfect chance to make the first bohemian show, then they go to the Moulin Rouge, where Christian falls in love with Satine, the star of the Moulin Rouge, and after a really comical sequence, Harold Zidler, who is the leader of the Moulin Rouge and the Duke decide to invest on the show,but the Duke wants Satine, and this is where the problem starts, and i won't give it out the rest, that's up to you, but of course, the film does have its minor flaws, for example that thing that Satine has to sleep with the  Duke in order to save Christian's bohemian ending in the play, it's just corny, but still acceptable, the acting between the actors is great, no one fails, Nicole Kidman truly does deserve her Oscar nomination, everyone is perfect, the cinematography is wonderful, it could dizzy you, specially if you have a very big widescreen TV like me, anyways let me get more in depth.<BR>PLOT:****:Well, it seems that the plot is a little bit thin, but still great.<BR>SCREENPLAY:****1/2, wonderful, except for the Duke and Satine thing i mentioned before, it has a great poetic dialouge, and it avoids most of the typical Hollywood cliches.<BR>ACTING:*****:As i said before, there is a great chemistry between Nicole  Kidman and Ewan McGregor, everyone is perfect.<BR>CINEMATOGRAPHY:Stunning, and it truly does do a great service to the film.<BR>SOUNDTRACK: ****1/2: I liked all thesongs, the problem is that the soundtrack in some songs sound a bit too syntetize, i know they used keyboards to do the music,many other people do it great, but this time was a bit annoying, instead of making it sound like remaking the song, it sounds like if it's parodizing it.<br />Well,thats it, i truly did loved this film, i recommend it for ages 12 and older, there is some sexual content,but don't worry there is nothing wild or porno you might see
B000024D4R|5.0|At the time that Animals was released, Pink Floyd was almost at the height of their career. With the commercial breakthrough of 'Dark Side of the Moon' and the somewhat similar follow-up album 'Wish You Were Here' Pink Floyd was at a point in their career where they were continually becoming more popular in the rock music scene. With the staggering success of 'Dark Side of the Moon', Pink Floyd suddenly broke into the charts, snagging a place on the Billboard album chart for a decade. Their follow-up album, 'Wish You Were Here' (A very worthy successor to 'Dark Side' indeed) garnered more money and fame for the British rockers, and the album was very much like 'Dark Side of the Moon'. However, when Pink Floyd released their next album in 1977, titled 'Animals' the band revealed a harsher side to their music. This new feel to Pink Floyd was arguably brought on by their rising fame, which caused Roger Waters, the band's bass player, to take matters into his own hands, therefore writing most of the dark lyrics contained in 'Animals.' With the success of 'Animals', Pink Floyd's musical transformation was complete, and Roger Water's dark lyrics heard from 'Animals' returned again on the band's concept album 'The Wall'. <br />'Animals' was a concept album like 'The Wall', but unlike 'The Wall', 'Animals' was loosely based on George Orwell's fable 'Animal Farm' and is based on the same concept as Orwell's classic novel. Roger's hateful but inspired lyrics were divided into three classes of people that he refers to as animals; pigs, dogs, and sheep. The dogs are greedy businessmen whose only care is wealth; the pigs are selfish, overrated political leaders, and the sheep are the foolish, witless followers.<br />'Animals' also boasts some of Pink Floyd's greatest musical achievement. The three main songs (Pigs, Dogs, and Sheep) are all over ten minutes long, and the rock arrangements form a collage of David Gilmour's mournful guitar playing, Nick Mason's startling drumming style, Roger's creepy lyrics, and Rick Wright's underrated talent with a keyboard. <br />'Animals' and its follow-up concept album, 'The Wall' are both very alike, and they both have their high and low points. 'The Wall' is an unbelievably depressing album, but the story it tells is powerful, and it will undoubtedly move you. Unlike 'The Wall' 'Animals' doesn't tell a story, rather it makes a political statement in three ways. The songs on 'Animals' aren't as shocking or as depressing as the songs on 'The Wall', but the meaning of the songs on 'Animals' is much more straight-forward than the meaning of the songs on 'The Wall', which means less frustration upon interpreting the album. Both albums are wonderful though, and I would highly recommend purchasing them.
B00005A0N5|4.0|Oceanborn, the second album from Finnish symphonic/Goth metal/power prog band Nightwish is distinctly different from other bands in this B&B (Beauty & Beast) genre. <br />It still boasts occasional riffing and drum beats in triple time. And there are still the odd growling male vocals (only on a couple of tracks, however). And the de rigueur juxtaposition of metal guitars with orchestration and synths accompanied by a crystal-clear operatic female vocal (from Tarja Turunen) is still the banner under which Nightwish proudly marches.<br />But whereas other Beauty & Beast/Goth metal bands (such as the dismal The Sins of Thy Beloved, or the aptly named Theater of Tragedy) wallow in the mire of doom and gloom, Nightwish takes the high road. Most of the songs are extremely upbeat, lively and seem to be full of -- dare I say it? -- joy. <br />Another difference is the presence of guitar solos. Many bands in this genre (even my beloved After Forever) eschew guitar solos for one reason or another, but Nightwish sprinkles their bombastic songs with an occasional fretboard flurry that ratchets up the excitment level a notch or two. Tastefully done.<br />The CD starts with a bang -- \\"Stargazers\\" -- and takes the listener on a brisk, but enjoyable, ride. This track has more in common with progressive rock's grandeur and majesty than it does with European Goth/symphonic metal. This is a great song, the perfect album opener. Lots of power and Dream Theater-like fast guitar/keyboard runs. (I love that synth change-up at 3:20 into the song!)<br />Some songs on Oceanborn are slower than others, and a flute plays a key role in a few (the beautiful \\"Swanheart,\\" for one). But all are nicely done and worthy of repeated listenings.<br />\\"Gethsemane,\\" for example (track two) sounds like Baroque meets Metal -- in a Trans-Siberian Orchestra sort of fashion. Lots of piano tinkling and syncopation. This song features a nice flute melody dancing lightly over the top of the crunching guitars --with a suitably neoclassical break at 3:04 into the song.<br />The first track to feature the growling male vocals (unfortunately) so common to this genre is track three: \\"Devil & the Deep Dark Ocean\\" (although this is more of a rap-tinged, talk-sing vocal than a flat-out growling vocal).<br />Track four (\\"Sacrament of Wilderness\\") begins with a cool guitar/drum/synth combination that gives way to a neoclassical burst of notes and driving beat that propels the song forward.<br />\\"Passion at the Opera\\" (track five) begins as a straightforward hard rock riff -- but with an operatic female vocal rather than what would be (in America, at least) a male vocal.<br />The aforementioned \\"Swanheart\\" (track six) is a slow-paced, emotional, piano and flute composition that sounds like it could be sung in church on Sunday morning. Even when the drums pound in at 2:20 and the guitars enter at 2:44 (hey, Stryper did it, didn't they?) it still sounds like a power ballad you'd be pleased to hear played on a sleepy Sunday morning. Nightwish truly know how to craft a song, and \\"Swanheart\\" is audible proof.<br />\\"Moondance\\" (track seven) is pure life and joy. It's a Russian dance beat that begins slowly, almost sadly, then bursts upon the scene as a song you can picture in your mind as being the backdrop to a line of guys, crouching with their arms folded, kicking out first one leg and then the other, yelling \\"Hey!\\" This instrumental track is brilliant. A lot of fun. And much too short at 3:30.<br />\\"The Riddler\\" (track eight) is a Eurythmics-sounding song that you'd swear was sung by Annie Lennox. Tarja Turunen's voice reminds me of Lennox's, anyway, but on this song the similarity is striking.<br />\\"The Pharaoh Sails to Orion\\" (track nine) is a scorcher. It's 6:15 of hard-driving, twisting and turning rock music that builds to a wonderful crescendo.<br />The album begins to wind down with \\"Walking in the Air\\" (track 10), a much-needed breather after \\"Pharaoh.\\" The slower \\"Walking inthe Air\\" leaves a pleasant taste in one's mouth. In fact, it leaves one wanting more. <br />And the \\"more\\" comes in the form of the CD's final track (\\"Sleeping Sun\\") an ambient, Enya-like track with a wistful, melancholy quality to it.<br />Oceanborn shows the world that Nightwish are not your typical Goth metal band. They have solid songwriting abilities, a firm grasp of melody and a desire to be known as a group that rises above the norm. Their songs are much lighter, much happier and much easier to listen to -- a far cry from most other bands in this genre that usually leave their listeners bruised, bloodied, broken and depressed to the point of suicide after their sonic onslaughts.<br />I wholeheartedly recommend Oceanborn ....
0553213105|4.0|Being the first Jane Austen novel which I have ever read, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Pride and Prejudice was nothing at all as I had expected.  Full of wit and humor, as well as a romance both entirely innocent and mature (a virtue sadly lacking in much of this age's romances), Pride and Prejudice also conveys the polished skill with which Austen writes.  I was most surprised to find that Austen, with her sophisticated style, was in her late teens/early twenties when she wrote this novel.<br />  I could easily go on about her style, vocabulary, and intricate sentences (I had a little trouble following her sometimes), but the main focus should always be given to the story itself.  Insightful and often hilarious characterization gave texture to the story, as did the complex personalities of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.  Mr. Bennet's off-hand remarks and Mary's deeply celebral, pompous observations on morality brightened up the scenery considerably.  Jane Austen exercises expert storytelling to catch (and keep) interest until the very realistic, very satisfying, conclusion.<br />  Pride and Prejudice has earned its way onto my \\"feel-good\\" list of books, and I'm sure I'll be re-reading it for many years to come.  Don't be discouraged by its old-fashioned front.  Pride and Prejudice is one story that no one should be deprived of.<br />Oh, and if you haven't seen the movie, go see it!
B00004YZFQ|5.0|A classic of our times, or before them for some people.  See Tina before she became a grandmother, airplane before they became Starship, the Burrito Brothers before Gram died and Mick before he became a characature of himself.  The scariest night in rock history retold and a testament to the decade that gave us so many bands.  Watch it over and over again as it gets better every time.  Mick is skinny, Keith is majestic and Charlie is Charlie.
B000002BYD|4.0|This CD is musically good. It will make you feel happy just listening to it...unlike today's pop (excuse me while i retch) music. The highlights of the CD are: &quot;Faithfull&quot; &quot;No Way&quot; &quot;Wishlist,&quot; &quot;Pilate&quot; &quot;Push Me Pull Me&quot; and the take on the Beatles song, &quot;All These Yesterdays&quot; (musical takeoffs are hard to do, and this one succeeds well). My first PJ album and i really like it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I must admit I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers.  Such Films as Fargo, The Big Lebowski, Raising Arizona and Millers Crossing are some of my favorites.  Oh Brother Where Art Thou just adds to the list.  George Clooney is great as Everett, the leader of  three escaped cons from a chain gang in search of a hidden treasure.<BR>  Along the way they stop in at a local radio station to cut a record (&quot;sing into a can&quot;)as the Soggy Bottom Boys for a few dollars.  While they're trying to dodge a ruthless bounty hunter, have a run in with an unscrupulous bible salesman (John Goodman), Baby Face Nelson and the Klan, their song becomes a big hit.<BR>  I've watched this movie about ten times at least and it gets better and funnier all the time. (yes I have a lot of time on my hands.) John Turturro and Charles Durning also star.
B00005A46T|4.0|... Slipknot is one of those bands you listen to to get entertained, not to find a personal meaning in.  If you like music that is loud, fast, and abusive to the public, you should pick it up, I only give it 4 stars because it gets monotonous after awhile. Still worth the buy...
6305426651|5.0|One of the best films ever made is without a doubt Roberto Benignis \\"Life is beautiful\\". This talented director and comic actor, first Oscar winning for best actor non-English speaker thought of a movie about  a Jewish man called Guido who overcomes horror and pain thanks to the great and unbreakable love he has for his son. The story takes place in Mussolini's Italy during World War II, in which the German soldiers deported Jewish people of all ages into the concentration camps where they were killed in various horrible ways. The film itself is a combination of comicality, romanticism and a bit of realism, which creates a very profound story that touches the bottom of everyone's hearts. Guido, the optimist humorous man gets to know Dora in funny circumstances and both fall in love, marry and have one son. After that, the story takes a quick turn. Guido and his family were deported by German soldiers. While in the concentration camps, Guido decides to protect his child from the awaiting horrors by hiding his own fear and tiredness and keeping his humor and using his great imagination in order to convince his son that life is great, always trying to keep his son's dreams and desires awake. The idea of protecting a child's innocence is one of the most wonderful and profound ideas in the whole world, and that's what makes this story the most wonderful ever.
0780631684|5.0|Final Destination is an awesome movie it's right up there with Scream in the horror movies category. And it's right up there with Idle Hands in the Devon Sawa (Wild America) category.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|In my opinion, London Calling is tied for best rock album of all time with the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street. People say this is the album that brought punk into the living room, but it's not really punk. It's rock with an edge that includes hints of punk and a lot of reggae influences (Rudie Can't Fail, Revolution Rock). It's also full of intelligent writing and satire of the times. (&quot;In the gleaming corridor of the 51st floor, the money can be made if you really want some more.&quot; - Koka Kola). And I know several people who would rank Train in Vain among the top five rock songs of all time, if not No. 1. This album is a work of art. And it has stood the test of time. I will never get tired of playing London Calling.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is an excellently crafted work of art. I enjoyed the film immensley. I sat through it once and would have sat through it the rest of the night, had I not had school in the morning. I reccommend it highly to fans of anything from director M.Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense) and any future work from writer/director Christopher Nolan. Bye.
B000002IMG|5.0|Testament really outdid themselves with this release. Their first album, The Legacy was definitely one of the best thrash albums ever released. The New Order, however, eclipsed that offering hands down as Testament released another album of songs that hooked, grooved and drove. From the opener, to The (mosh)  Pit, Disciples of the Watch and the final dirge, they proved that their first album was no fluke thanks to the three main men, Chuck, Eric, and Alex, the latter two being one of the best writing combos ever. Slashing riffs and scorching, melodic solos fill this album complimented by the vocal screams. There is so much power in this album it is not even funny and it was not until Low was released that Testament regained what they had during this period. So thrash fans, if you don't have this in your collection, get it now.

0790729377|5.0|Shortly after Blanche Dubois (played by Vivien Leigh) moves in with her sister Stella for temporary shelter, Stella's husband (Stanley, played by Marlon Brando) begins to suspect that Blanche is a fallen woman who's on the run and masquerading as a respectable lady. Stanley then decides he'll stop at nothing to destroy Blanche's hopes for a normal life. What happens in this movie will have you glued to the screen from start to finish. ASND has realistic , powerful acting from Leigh, Brando, Malden and Hunter .......This film makes my Top 5 Movies of All Time. If you consider yourself a \\"tender\\" person (as opposed to wicked/ruthless) then do yourself a favor and watch ASND. It's a primal reminder that the Gentle/Tender should always be watchful of their archenemy, the Wicked! It's no wonder ASND won so many Oscars. Blanche is a highly demanding role for any actress and Vivien Leigh steps up to the plate and hits a grand slam with her perfect performance ...and yes, Leigh won the Oscar for Best Actress. Even more amazing is the fact that Leigh is from the U.K. and Blanche is pure Mississippi ex-plantation debutante
0930289528|4.0|Back in1981, Moore imagined a post-apocalyptic 1998 in which Great Britain has become a racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, and Christian fascist state, all run by \\"the leader\\" who sits at a bank of video monitors run by a central computer. (For some reason, many readers have the mistaken impression that the setting is one in which the Nazi's won WWII, even though it's clear from flashbacks that that's not what happened). While it's a clear reaction to the Thatcher regime, the setting draws directly from Orwell's 1984, and other dystopian literature.<br />However, standing against this bleak world is the anarchist vigilante \\"V\\". Modeled roughly on Guy Fawkes, who attempted to blow up Parliament back in 1605, V is empowered by superhuman physical and mental attributes acquired while the subject of Mengle-like medial experiments in a now derelict state concentration camp. He's now using his abilities to methodically kill all the government personnel associated with his torture. And when he's not killing people, he's sneaking around blowing landmarks and generally bringing the state to its knees. An important theme Moore hammers home here is that the state is not solely to blame, but the people who place their popular power in the hands of the state are equally to blame. (Those who are interested in this particular streak of political philosophy would be well advised to check out C. Douglas Lummis` book, Radical Democracy.) Instead of a superhero saving the populace, we are given an ambiguous vengeful killer instructing the populace to save itself.<br />There's a whole subplot involving a teenager V rescues from the streets. However, she's largely used as a subject for him to talk at, and for the reader to get the backstory of the setting. There are a number of other subplots as well, involving the shady state functionaries, and Moore does a lot of cinematic intercutting between the various storylines. The story gets somewhat too theatrical at points, and drags at other times, and V's constant quoting (Rolling Stones and Velvet Underground lyrics to Shakespeare) gets old fast. The art is generally pretty nice, although the color isn't really to my taste, it might have looked better in simple black and white. However, it's a pretty decent quick meditation on what it means to be free and how each individual must look within themselves for the answer rather than assigning that freedom to someone else to safeguard.times, and V's constant quoting (Rolling Stones and Velvet Underground lyrics to Shakespeare) gets old fast.

0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen masterfully weaves an endearing love story, with cosmic irony, and a keen awareness for social distinctions, which took us through a colorful journey of mind, body, and soul. Her humor shines through the biting sarcasm of Mr. Bennet's expected, yet amusing remarks about Mrs. Bennet's &quot;nerves,&quot; and his daughter's suitors, namely Mr. Collins. This unctuous character also provided us with a few laughs by quietly portraying the absurdity of society's emphasis on &quot;connections&quot; with the upper class. <BR>    Another part of the novel, which we greatly enjoyed, was the blooming romance between Darcy and Elizabeth. Though their union was much anticipated, we were kept on our toes by the many twist and turns it took throughout the novel. At one point, we were greatly disappointed with Darcy's overbearing arrogance when he made it explicitly clear to Elizabeth that it was against his own will to love her. But then we were heart warmed by his kindness to her and the Gardiners at the Pemberley estate, exemplifying his true character.<BR>   Aside from its humor and romance, this novel also prides itself in its vivid illustrations of class structures of early 19th century England. Austen clearly depicts the importance and influence of the social classes on every aspect of life, predominantly marriage, wealth, education, and values. One scene, which we believed to be a great example of Austen's comprehensive knowledge of the social classes, is when Lady Catherine rudely confronts Elizabeth on Darcy's proposal to marry her, all the while mocking her estate, her family, and her life. Yet, Elizabeth once again proves her superior attitude and strength as an independent woman, and takes Lady Catherine's comments with wisdom and maturity. <BR>  Truly a classic, Pride and Prejudice exemplifies a sincere love that breaks social boundaries. Throughout its 150 years of publication Pride and Prejudice has remained a cornerstone of the literary world, and we recommend it to everyone. And beware; this book ends with a bang, in more ways than one.
B00003CXA6|5.0|What???  You're asking yourself, \\"What?\\"  How could a film about the climatic battle of the American Civil War have any relevance on today's post-9/11 world?  Well, it's in the dialogue, not the \\"action\\".  Let me explain.  Go to Chapter 20 and listen to the dialogue between the Confederate General Kemper, (I think) and the British officer.  The dialogue talks about how that in a democracy, the government derives its power from the consent of the people.  However as the South's major gripe is that it doesn't consent with the laws of the Federal government, so that is what it bases its griefance to secede from the Union in favor of strong State governments.  Sound familiar?  That's what today we call \\"Europe\\".  Instead of a united union as the European Union is trying to accomplish, there's still international animosity over there.  Just think of the power the \\"Union of European States\\" could accomplish if they banded together.<br />But anyway, how does that tie into 9/11, well it doesn't directly, but in a round about way it does.  It ties in to that a united union as the United States is today, due to the victory of the North in the Civil War, is as strong as ever in time of crisis.  Hence the ol' quote, \\"United We Stand, Divided We Fall.\\"<br />Now, enough about politics.  Let's talk about the film itself and the DVD.  First of all, the film itself is the definitive period piece of the battle of Gettysburg.  No other film to date has captured the essense of those three glorious and gory days in July 1863.  For one it uses actual Civil War re-enactors for all of the common foot soldiers.  Not only that but it was all filmed on location in Gettysburg National Park.  By using actual re-enactors, they already had their equipment and most importantly their heart into making this film.  Mostly because they filmed it on the hallowed ground that is Gettysburg.<br />Now for the DVD itself.  The picture transfer is excellent.  In 16x9 enhanced mode it is extremely sharp and detailed.  I find [the] rating of 3.5 a bit low.  I'd say it's more like a 4.5.  The only thing keeping it from a 5 is that the colors are a bit on the \\"cool\\" side.  Meaning that the ultra-violet comes through a bit more than it should. (My TV has a color temp control and a setting to Warm makes them look a little more natural.)<br />The sound is actually quite good as well.  Much clearer than my old VHS copy.  It's recorded in a 5.0 Surround, so no .1 LFE.  But the bass still comes through quite nicely on the cannon shots and in Randy Edelman's score.<br />Now for the extras, are not bad, but not all that great either.  You get a vintage documentary that covers the actual battlefield and whatnot.  Then you get a few short clips of cast and crew interviews.  A few trailers and TV spots.  Actually a relatively short narrated overview of some archived maps of the battle is quite informative.  But apparently the running comentary is supposed to be really informative, but I have't got the time to watch a 4 hour movie with the commentary on.<br />Well so if you want a long lasting version of this 1993 Turner Entertainment film of Gettysburg, be sure to grab this DVD.  ...detailed.

B000021Y77|1.0|This movie doesn't even deserve one star.  The script was horribly written, and they kept on playing the SAME thing over and over and over again.  Little parts changed while they replayed it, but I knew I couldn't stand to watch ANOTHER rerun again.  I had to watch this movie for German and I'm certainly not watching it again.
B000000OSG|5.0|It might not be the heaviest or most brutal album in the world, but II really makes the &quot;trilogy&quot; complete. In my opinion, Appetite, and Illusion I &amp; II are all equally as good. Actually, I would say every G n' R album is as good as the other. It's one of those bands where you just have to have every album or else it's hard to sleep at night. That's the way it was for me anyways. (I know, that's dumb, oh well!) They were truly classic!
0930289331|5.0|Frank Miller's Batman:  Year One is without a doubt one of Miller's best stories and arguably the greatest Batman tale ever told.  In this series, Frank Miller was given the task of basically re-inventing the Batman character which he did such amazing work on in The Dark Knight Returns.  This time, rather than tell of Batman's future, Miller retells the origin of the then 50-year-old comics character.  The story is reset in a contemporary ('80s) setting, though the tale retains a timeless feel and overall, the basic story could be set anywhere in the 20th century.<BR>For this story, Miller has stripped Batman of all the wild and crazy additions which he made use of in DKR (and to excess in the sequel DK2.) <BR>It tells the tale of a 25-year-old Bruce Wayne first beginning his career as the Batman.  Unlike in the original 1939 comics, James Gordon is younger and still a Lieutenant when the Dark Knight begins his crusade.  The story is told from the persective of both good cop Gordon and the outlaw viligante Wayne<BR>and tells how they eventually find they must unite in order to continue their respective battles in a totally corrupt Gotham City.<BR>Young Wayne/Batman is convincingly portrayed as a youthful beginner still learning the ropes of being a superhero.  He has not yet become the magnificently crazy force of nature shown in DKR.  Gordon is shown as a very human hero who must fight evil in a more normal way.  Catwoman is also introduced as a vengeful ex-prostitute.<BR>The story has a noirish feel, and Mazzuchelli's understated but strong drawing looks unimpressive at first glance, but tells the story in a direct, undistracting manner.  <BR>I wish there were more Batman tales like this - mature, noir dramas without a lot of silly sci-fi/fantasy gimickry.  I hope they are able to get that movie made!
B00005V0X5|1.0|(...) The sound quality still sounds horrible, I don't know what the big deal is.<BR>Megadeth has always been a sorry excuse for thrash metal, but their debut is absolutely, hilariously, horrible. If you want good, quality, non-panzy metal, stick with old Metallica, Hypocrisy, Black Sabbtah, Ozzy Osbourne, Pantera, Slayer, etc.
0385495323|5.0|I became a fan of Singh when I read Fermat's Enigma and I believe he has outdone his previous work with The Code Book, partly because he has a deeper subject to mine but also because he has found a comfortable space in which to write.  The Code Book is a wonderful tour of encryption, codes, and the importance of secrecy interwoven with seemingly well researched historical examples from Mary Queen of Scots to the Navajo Talkers.  The book brings into great relief the important role encryption and particularly decryption play in world events, particularly wars. He offers sufficient examples and science to make the work informative but not so much as to overwhelm.  <br />This is &quot;the book&quot; we all find that displaces all others until we are finished.  Good work.
B00000GBHA|5.0|I simply cannot understand how or why Rodriguez has been overlooked. I was given my copy of the LP in England in the 1980's by an Aussie who felt sorry for me having to watch the English rugby team! If he felt that my time would be better spent by the turntable he was right. The songs are stunning, as fresh today as the day they were recorded. When you listen to the drivel on most radio stations nowadays, you have to despair when music like this is neglected.
0446678430|1.0|I more than anything want to retire young and retire rich myself, which is why I picked up a copy of this book and read it twice, cover to cover with an open mind.  My conclusion: I got conned into making the author richer by buying this book.<br />There's a few points that I will give this book: the concept of leverage is an important one to learn and yes, it does work when used wisely and after you've done your homework.  It is motivational - you do want to get rich fast even more after you read this book.<br />However, this book seriously lacks credibility and details.  By taking a storytelling tone (which I admit makes the book easy to read) the author avoids offering any solid evidence that his approach to retiring rich works.  After doing some research, I found that \\"poor dad\\" is Ralph Kiyosaki, a PhD and was the head of the Hawaii dept. of education.  However, \\"rich dad\\" was never named - why not?  The author says he started several businesses - what were they?  Where did the startup capital come from?  What did they sell and to whom?  I see no reason why this information is not revealed, it should be a source of pride, unless there is some kind of shame associated with it that the author wants to mask.  I really want to see the author quote and cite some sources, name some names, show me some real numbers, and build a case to convince me that his method works.  I'd really like to see some accounts from some real people who have tried the different techniques he sells/tells.  He's going out on a limb with comparatively new/radical techniques but he's trying to convince the reader to believe him just on faith.  If you doubt him in the book, he just says that \\"you haven't learned how to leverage your mind to handle risk yet.\\"  I don't know about that - the way I manage my risk is by learning more about the problem and applying some form of logical/methodical/reasoned approach to mitigate the risk.<br />The writing of the book is repetitive and sounds like a sales pitch for the authors' other books and products when he constantly refers the reader to the other books for more information.  There is already a listing of the other richdad products both at the beginning and the end of the book.  Why keep promoting the items inside the text of the book?  When the author tries to sell things while trying to teach things, it really blows his credibility.  In addition, the author very rarely suggests other reading materials or sources besides his own books and products - why is that?  If these techniques work, why isn't there any other literature out there the author can point readers to for more information?<br />One of the biggest problems I have with the book is he makes everything sound way too easy.  Residential real estate is something that is fairly manageable, although where do you all of a sudden get enough money to take out a loan to rent an apartment building?   That initial capital has to come from somewhere.  Where?  Trading stock options can give you limitless returns, but why is it that 90% of the people who trade stock options lose all their money?  There are no citations for the reader to go and find out more about trading options successfully (if that is possible).  Specifically on one point in the book: why in the world would you ever buy a put option to bet against a stock that you own?  Any decent investor would want to research and buy stocks that will perform, not sink.  If you have a feeling that the stock will sink badly in the near future, don't buy a put option, sell it now!  The author makes business building sound easy - I know many successful CEOs, moderate self-starters, and devoted people who have poured their hearts out trying and not making it.  None of them are retired and living filthy rich like the author described.  I'm a business owner myself, and I'll tell you one thing, you work your tail off just to make ends meet.. to come out rich like the author tells it is not a piece of cake.<br />More or less, the point of the book boils down to, \\"if Kiyosaki can get rich, so can you, but Kiyosaki's just gonna sell (not tell) you a vague notion of how.\\"  As the cliche goes, \\"the devil is in the details.\\"  This book really steers clear from any details and evidence and it is way too easy to overlook this fact because we all want to retire young and retire rich and that can easily put blinders on people (myself included).  If you buy this book, really sit down and try to evaluate and analyze it on its merits - you'll find there really isn't much there below the philosophical surface.<br />I try like crazy to take a step to make it big every day of my life, but if the secret formula to get rich is in this book, there sure as heck better be a serious increase in the number of rich people in this country in the next five to ten years to prove my assessment wrong.  I'm looking forward to hearing some success stories and talking to those who made it - at least that way when I am wrong we will all know there is an easy way to get rich quick after all.
0440219078|4.0|This book was an amazing book. Once i got reading the book i did not want to put it down, thats how good the book was. The Giver made you think while reading the story and makes you realize things about life and makes you think about what you usually wouldnt think about. The story is mysterious and adventurous. It's an imagination with reality. wow its a fanastic book. I totally recommand this book. If you are bored and need something new and exciting this is the book to read!!
B00000JXAK|5.0|...the likes of Elvis Costello to Lou Reed to 'NSync (joke) list this as one of their favorites...Is there a term 'Gothic-Acid-Folk Music'? well, there is now...<BR>Columbia UK have now reissued GARDEN also, and there is a rumor of a possible<BR>3rd album/live release (1971) some time in the future...
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch's masterwork of dreams and Hollywood (and both) titled Mulholland Drive is something which might go more for the viewer than for the audience as a whole.  If you are looking for logic, you should leave after the first love scene, otherwise you'll be frustrated, as would a person who wound't get Lynch's other works.  This is a picture that examines a surreal reality and then shifts into an even more surreal dreamworld with nightmares patched about.  And it is done so flawlessly, so much in a feeling of beauty and enlightenment, it is very hard for this reviewer to complain.<br />Bottom line, wonderful if strange Lynch film gets boast from bizarre and fascinating scenes including superb performances by Harring, Watts, Thoreux and others in smaller roles (even a Robert Forster cameo is appreciated).
B0000011MT|4.0|You are right-OTS is a FIVE star album...GOJD is 4 star...it lacks the overall theme of drama that OTS has-and it is COLUMBIA that just put this out again in the UK-same label that had them in 1970! at least someone there has brains!
B000001GGV|5.0|Pogorelich's rendition of fifteen or so of the Master's sonatas is nothing short of orgasmic; this CD is a big-hearted, rowdy, full-throated, plates-filled, glasses-overflowing, week-long Mediterranean romp, and we are all invited. Pogorelich's sound is robust in the \\"riotous\\" sonatas, and crystalline and delicate in the \\"sensual\\" ones. His technique is...oh, goodness! I mean this man has the incredible ability to, within a sixteen-note, shift from a full-throttle fortissimo to a most delicate pianissimo; any pianist can tell you: that ain't easy. Pogorelich's ability to \\"shade\\" the voices and \\"nuance\\" a phrase is unmatched. I cannot recommend this recording too highly; it is absolutely astonishing. The control that Pogorelich has over the instrument is spectacular, and his musicianship flawless, though I realize that not few would violently disagree with my assessment of his musicianship.<br /> Might I also suggest two other performer's delightful recordings of Scarlatti's (The Master) sonatas, both of which I might happily add are available through Amazon.com; namely those of: Dubravka Tomsic, and Eteri Andjaparidze. One caveat however, while both Tomsic and Andjaparidze are brilliant technicians, as far as pure joy and flare are concerned Tomsic comes closer to Pogorelich's lofty heights than does Eteri. Nevertheless those are two additionally brilliant recordings. I haven't heard Horowitz's renditions in quite some time so I do not feel qualified to speak as to their quality, only to say that I seem to remember that they seemed a bit lifeless when I heard them last.<br /> N.B. For those like me who are hard-core Scarlatti fans, one more suggestion: try to catch the Shostakovich's orchestration for wind ensemble, a quintet if I am not mistaken, of few of The Masters sonatas; they are quite charming and, in typical Shostakovich fashion, quite witty.
B00005K3NR|5.0|&quot;Carrie&quot; is definitely one of the best DVDs I own in terms of value.  Rarely do you find a DVD at this price with great extras, picture, and sound, but &quot;Carrie&quot; definitely succeeds in this department.<br />The film is both entertaining and disturbing.  Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie received well-deserved Oscar nominations for their excellent performances.  Brian De Palma achieves excellent direction en route to one of the most memorable climaxes in cinema history.  The score compliments the film well, although some of the 70's music is rather cheesy at times.  Overall, a great, entertaining movie on a great DVD.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I killed my girlfriend listening to this album!  It worked out pretty well, actually.  You'd be surprised how homicidal this music can make you.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|&quot;Patton&quot; is a great film.  George C. Scott depicts an American hero in one of the best performances I've seen, alongside the likes of Jack Nicholson in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; and Tom Hanks in &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot;  The battle sequences are unique from those seen in most war movies; the battles are shown from the general's perspective, which captures the amazing spectacle of the entire battlefield.  <br />The true strength of the film, however, is the character of Patton.  A hard-nosed, determined man, Patton now serves as an inspiration to myself and many others who have seen this great movie.  Although his excessive pride may have proven his downfall, one cannot deny the patriotism and strength of will he exudes.
B00003CX97|5.0|Last night I enjoyed the pleasure of watching &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; for the first time, and it was an experience I won't soon forget.  David Lean crafts a visual masterpiece; the stunning landscapes and awe-inspiring scale of the bridge are utterly amazing.  Character-development is this film's other primary strength; each of the main characters provides a unique portrayal of pride and its effects on man, encouraging the viewere to think as he/she is entertained.  <br />The film is moderately-paced throughout.  There isn't an abundance of action for today's impatient audiences, but the film never becomes boring.  The second disc features an abundance of extras for a movie of this age, including an excellent one-hour documentary.  Overall, this is a great purchase for any fan of classic cinema.
B0000036I9|5.0|&quot;DON'T CHANGE A HAIR&quot;!  Yes, we've all heard that before, and 'stay as sweet as you are' -  another old chestnut!<br />WELL, this misplaced jewel of a movie is all about Eve and a somewhat cautionary tale about 'Transforming' - difficult if you are the glamorous Michele Morgan initially as the somewhat dowdy heroine, almost pushed into changing or 'augmenting' her appearance, and boy is there a transformation - with not too happy results.....not quite the Frankenstein myth, but the concept translates quite well.  It's a slightly bitter French pill - aptly conceived way ahead of its time!<br />Except for the title - this has no bearing whatsoever on the rather vanilla remake [?] was it?<br />Do try to locate this one - well worth the effort - and always contemporary!
B00005UEAR|3.0|It's surprising to me that most of these reviewers prefer the 2nd disc on this album.  The first one is MUCH stronger musically, though even it is lacking somewhat in musicality.  My favorite song is DISAPPEAR because it is so dark, sad, and emotional.  The next best song is BLIND FAITH, though the mix is absolutely terrible.  The mixing on this album is the worst I've heard on any album, ever.  Most of the time you can't even hear the keyboard unless Jordan is playing a solo, and even then it seems very subdued.  And J. Labrie's vocals are often overpowered by the loud and obnoxious M. Portnoy.  M. Portnoy is awful on this album, and even worse live.  Get this album for the first disc, as the second, while interesting, is very cliche and cheesy.
B0000508U6|4.0|I've been lax in my reviews of late, but I'm here to make amends, and the first one in a while has got to be this one--a disc my roommate turned me onto.<br />After so many repeated listens, I was able to get past its derivatives and maintain to any of Coldplay's detractors that it doesn't suffer when compared to its obvious influences (Nick Drake, the Cure, the shoegazer-era bands circa '91), and boasts a few of the best tracks that will come out of this early decade.<br />'Don't Panic','Yellow', and (my personal favourite)'Trouble' particularly stand out, but I do hope that they can make their next album as impressive.  A mellow-fest to be sure, but strangely addictive.
B00005B4GU|5.0|As a you listen to any Radiohead album, you mist step back and expect anything and everything. I had the idea a continuation of 'Kid A' in my mind when I bought this album. However, I discovered something much better, an album which showed yet another side in the band of Radiohead. As if you could not tell they were a multi-layered band from 'OK Computer', 'The Bends', and 'Kid A'; here comes 'Amnesiac' firmly placing it as an album that once again erases people's tags and labels on the band from England and the music they make.<br />The seemless flow of the songs on the album create an amazing blanket of music which covers and surrounds the listener as they listen. My favorite among the album, and I would say even among other songs of Radiohead, has to be track four: 'You and Whose Army?' A song sung with much passion, it truly shows a deep musical and lyrical side to Radiohead. Every song deserves soemthing to be written on, yet it would be suffice to say this: buy the album. I was not let down. I still love, even after nine months!
B00005NVT1|3.0|The homage to KISS by releasing a 'live album'?  Well, the notion is sometimes quite silly, depending on the artist involved.<br />Certain drum'n'bass sets are radically different, which isn't the case here, although that isn't a bad thing.  'Homework' was justifiably brilliant, minimalist-techno with just enough of the 90's to make it a club staple in bars around the world.  'Discovery' was a definite let-down, drowning in overuse of Peter Frampton (and Cher) vocoder-effects, and cheesy '80s production, although it still had its moments.<br />...except that with a lack of liner notes, any kind of details concerning the concert (which for all intents and purposes could be a fake live album like Ministry's \\"In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up\\"), and a single-track listing which arrogantly presumes the whole album is so flawless (which it isn't) it should be heard that way.<br />There are some great beats that demand to be heard in this set, but it's not essential by any means.  If you loved 'Homework', you'll be a bit disappointed by this album.
B00003CX5P|2.0|After watching this film,  I realized that George answers to no one. How did this movie ever get released?  George seems to have lost all touch with his fans and what it takes to tell a good story. This film  could not have possibly been test screened. While this movie is stocked with great actors, their performances were wooden. Scenes were flat. Characters had no chemstry. Lucas definately seemed more concerned with the fx in the background than what was going on with the main characters. I really disliked the heavy digital look, especially during the final battle. TPM is not a movie, but more like a 2 hour video game. The script was horrible and the movie moved at a slow pace. After the criticism that the cutsie Ewoks drew, I can not belive that he gave so much attention to Jar Jar, who made people in the theater shift uncomfortably in their chairs. Darth Maul was the coolest thing about the movie and he only got about five minuites time. The absolute worst thing about this movie is the introduction of the midocloreans. I have always thought that the force was a spiritul power, not due to a bunch of bacteria. This not only ruins this movie, but the original trilogy. I felt this movie was an insult to most people's intelligence. It was written for kids, but I did not see many kids enjoying this movie. I could go on and on, but I will not. This movie's flaws are pretty evident. There is a big backlash against Star Wars and deservingly so. George is greedy. Where is Episode 4-6 on DVD IN ORIGINAL FORM. Where is Raiders on DVD. Attack of the Clones will be out in a few months, and by looking at the trailers i feel that we are in for more bad scripts and wooden acting. I will see this movie, but I feel that George is not capable of ever directing a movie again.
B00005QK3W|1.0|I couldn't stomach this album the first time. Most of the songs I could only listen to for about 30 - 45 seconds before I had to go to the next track. Absolutely nothing that I heard interested me. It was very disappointing. I hate to say it but I think it's time for him to retire. He's done some great stuff in the past, but not any longer. Save your money and buy something that has some energy and feeling to it.
B00005QIPH|4.0|but the media may have hyped it up a bit too much. Anyway,this is the best rock music I've heard out of any band in a while so why are so many people complaining? Sure, they use simple riffs and chords, but that doesn't mean they don't have talent. Has anyone seen them live?, I think that would answer their questions about talent. These guys can really play and solo. Songs like Soma and Someday have a really good sound. Julian Casablanca (thats quite a name) sounds ok using that microphone distortion thingy, but it could get a little old. I think he should use his natural voice more on future LPs. Overall, I think that the album definitely is one of the best of 2001. Its a nice change of pace when the music industry is crammed with boyband imitations of imitations...
B000001DZQ|3.0|Five stars, obviously on Roy's playing, which always managed to rise above the material, no matter how mediocre. But this collection mystifies me in the selection of material. <br />The first four selections of disc 1, &quot;previously unreleased,&quot; put Roy in a strange, psychedelicized place that is difficult to listen to. Roy was a power, electric blues player, and these pieces simply do him no favor at all.<br />By the fifth cut, we have his great version of Patsy Cline's &quot;Sweet Dreams,&quot; from his first Polydor album, and we also have the first taste of his muscular lyricism. The remainder of the first disc is nearly flawless, the highlight for me being the inclusion of the &quot;Second Album&quot;'s &quot;The Messiah Will Come Again.&quot; Roy couldn't sing -- at all -- yet somehow he was able to add something when he decided to vocalize, perhaps because he believed in the tune.<br />As for Disc 2, I saw Roy live, and because of that I'm confident in expressing my disappointment in the choices here. Other than &quot;Soul Dressing,&quot; none of the tracks are memorable (apologies to vocalist Billy Price, who was capable of some great vocal performances), and Polydor would have produced a much better disc by including more from the overlooked &quot;A Street Called Straight&quot; or from &quot;Loading Zone.&quot; <br />My advice? If you buy this set, pay little attention to the first four cuts on each disc. If you decide you love Roy's sound, as may of us did, listen to cuts 5 and on and then seek out the individual albums, which contain many gems the producer failed to include.
6305546789|4.0|If you and your friends want a good scare on Halloween, this is THE movie to see.  Jamie Lee Curtis is a great actress and plays the part really well.  What makes this movie really great, is that it could really happen.  Another thing that makes this movie great is the plot.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Apocalypse Now is the strange, almost surreal, tale of Lieutenant Williard's mission to go up the Nung River in the midst of the Vietnam war and terminate the command of the renegade Colonel Kurtz, portrayed by Marlon Brando.  The film is slow-paced then slaps you with a big suprise everytime.  It starts off good by showing Martin Sheen, a Lieutenant waiting for his next assignment, telling us a little bit about himself and then shows him in the middle of a little bloody drinking binge.  He's finally brought to headquarters to receive his next mission, and after it, he wouldn't want another one.  \\"It was a real choice mission\\" as he put it.  They wanted him to kill one of the best soldiers ever produced by the U.S. for killing 4 Vietnamese officers he believed to be double agents.  Willard's mission was to travel up the river with 4 navy recruits until reaching the Kurtz compound.  Their experiences along the way is what makes the movie as great as it is in my opinion.  He first visits the famous Captain Kilgore(portrayed by Robert Duvall) where he speaks the very popular quote, \\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning.\\"  Willard and the men also run into a U.S.O. show, a scary encounter with a tiger, and the last army outpost of the Nung River, the Do Lung bridge,which was under no order because nobody knew where the C.O. was.  In the redux version of the movie, the men come across a half-assed ran military outpost and even get a few hours with the Playboy bunnies from the U.S.O show, not the mention a visit to a plantation run by a very bitter French family.  Its definetly a must see and I've heard it is the most realistic depiction of Vietnam.  This is without a doubt, Francis Ford Coppola's true masterpiece.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|There aren't enough words I can use to describe this modern musical masterpiece. As a fan of musicals, I have not seen a movie so captivating, comical, whimsical, romantic, tragic, and overall...beautiful. It is a spectacular love story that we have all heard before but expressed in a way that we would have never imagined. None like I've ever seen before. Best of all, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman bless the film with their wonderful voices. Not everyone will feel the same way after watching this film, but this is a film that will stay in my heart forever.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Like exposed in the above title, this CD is the best CD ever produced. At first, all your interested in is ripping the disc outta the case, slamming it into the machine and calming your Clint Eastwood withdrawl, that catchy tune you can't live with out. However, you play the CD over, and decide you like ALL the songs. Play it again, and a strange epiphany overtakes you in a frightenned wave of cold...Good God, these songs are incomprehendably beautiful. Each it their own funky way, some low enough to make you cry, and others so high they lift you off the ground.<BR>Buy this CD.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This cd was even better than the last one.  I think that the way that he says things are great! He actually says the way people are thinking. He is just brave enough to say it out loud. All of the songs have a great sound and good lyrics. You all need to listen to it and keep in mind that he is just taking out anger in a way that is not harmfull to others! Well that sounds cheesy but hey... :)
B00000JQFM|5.0|This is my first Joe Satriani cd, and I think it's awesome. Joe's \\"Surfing with the Alien\\" and \\"Circles\\" have both become my favorite songs! Surfing with the alien is extremely wild from beggining to end, and Circles starts out calm, then goes bezerk, then back to calm again. There are more good songs such as Ice9,which has a awesome solo and chorus,and Crusing day, which is very similar to Ice9. Always with you,Always with me is a good song, but if your only here to get Joe's wild rock guitar playing, you probably wouldn't like it. And my other favorite, Satch Boogie, is a song that to me sounds kinda like Surfing with the Alien. It is a really good cd and it is my favorite.
B00003CXI1|2.0|As much as I appreciate the *hard work* of the three stars (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint)their first time on a movie screen is not their most brilliant. Add that to a director who probably should've been someone else, and the poor author who was too busy having a life to completely take over the project, and this movie falls short. The one redeming quality is Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) who is excellent in every way shape and form! Then subtract two for the two worst things: Richard Harris, who looked like he was going to die on the set; and Warner Borthers, who should die a fiery death for killing everything sacred. With a lame Quidditch scene (there ARE fouls in Quidditch) and tons of plot holes (how did Draco get detention too? Wait, where were they...? Oh never mind!) This might be something you'd rather rent, or not see at all.
B00005NW02|5.0|this album is the messiah. a gift to all true rock fans. system of a down are a 21st century metallica with a surpassing lyrical content to that of rage. the foursome hailing from armenia, based in the wonders of L.A have created a sound so original and astounding it is breath taking! their sound varies from nose-bleeding high tempo thrash metal to relaxing harmonic seronades between serj tankian and daron malakian. all conglomerating to create the 'perfect' rock album. songs to look out for are the two singles; chop suey! and toxicity and personal favourite psycho. this album will give you the highest adrenalin rush possible from a cd. to not purchase this cd would be a sacrilage to oneself and ones generation.
0792844890|4.0|I've read all reviews, and just want to add some exclusively for Rick Moranis, who plays Darth Helmet. I've seen him in other movies, mostly playing the good guy, but he'd never been so funny as in Spaceballs, playing the bad guy. He's the funniest bad guy I've ever seen, his voice changes are genius, his scene with the dolls (which improvised himself) is a classic. If you've never seen this movie, I recommend it to you if only to see the best bad guy characterization in comedy. A reference performance. I'm sure Jim Carrey took many from this Rick Moranis' character. I wonder what the hell happened with Rick, where are you now? Please, give us some more funny bad guy characters. I give the movie four stars because Rick was not in the commentary. Mel Brooks commentary is lame, he feels ashamed of this movie, and he shouldn't. It amazes me that kids that were too young to see Star Wars in theaters, and to see this movie shortly after, are buying Spaceballs and enjoying it so much. That means that the movie is a classic, because while not a big bucks success, it's been remembered after a long time. It even captures new generations, which doesn't happen with many movies.

0871137380|5.0|Just a few short weeks ago, I found myself at a local cinema watching Black Hawk Down (the movie, of course). I was very excited to see it. I enjoyed it and thought it was well-done. A few weeks after, I decided to purchase the book to see how it stacked up to the movie or, rather, how the movie stacked up to the book.<br />As it turned out, I found that the movie did an injustice to the book. Events were altered and in the movie, there was hardly any character development. You didn't know who was who or what they thought. In the book, that was greatly changed. You got into the mindset and thoughts of many of the soldiers who were fighting the battle (including Somali fighters and citizens). To top it all off, the book was historically accurate as possible. <br />If you've seen the movie or if you haven't seen the movie, I highly recommend this book. While not written in the first-person, you see the battle as it happened through the eyes of the soldiers who were fighting it. You want to keep reading. <br />Even more noble than the fact that it was historically accurate was Mark Bowden. He did not hand out his opinion in the book nor did he attempt to claim that after writing this book he had any military knowledge what-so-ever. He simply reported the facts.<br />If you liked the movie, buy the book. It's better. If you haven't seen the movie, buy the book. It's worth it.
B000000OQF|5.0|ok, first a little background. I'm a 16 year old male and i first heard this album when i was like 5 years old, it was my best friends favorite album and i thought it was alright. I then picked it up at a used record store when i was about 13-14 because i wanted to learn how to play sweet child o mine on guitar, i listened to that and a few of the other tracks and didn't hear anything special. fast forward to a couple of months ago, i was looking for something to listen to while walking home frome my buddies house and i saw appetite and thought what the hell? that sure as hell got me walking fast, this album has so much energy and truth to it that i had never heard before it pretty much knocked me [down] it was so good. the guitar work on those songs was the best of the 80's. maybe thats why it seemed so good, today you dont have to play killer solos you just have to tune youre guitar down and crank up the distortion. Modern day equivalents are anything but that, they make it sound like you have to be special or something but all they have is effects. bands like linkin park, limp bizkit, and staind will never equal the overall talent, energy, or even the sales of guns n roses.another amazing thing is that slash and axl were so... wasted 90% of the time and they could still play ike gods!
B00003CXXP|4.0|Much has been made of the contrasts between Kubrick's and Speilberg's respective styles, but such questions rarely inhibit the film's development.  Like all good science fiction, it creates a seamless futuristic environment that pays as much attention to the smallest household details as it does to the larger cities.  Jude Law's performance is astonishing (and full of Kubrickian overtones), but the film's best elements are the dark concerns that lurk underneath the surface.  Many of them, such as fear of abandonment and attempts for individuation, are primal and powerful, and drive the film into areas that prohibit easy answers.  It must be admitted that the screenplay isn't top caliber and several elements seem to be clashing against each other, but it ultimately poses unanswerable questions about loving imperfect beings and the neccesity of adapting emotional response.  And in the end, a film with abstract themes that polarized reviewers may be the best homage to Kubrick that could have been created.
6305535264|4.0|This is probably one of the most neglected ScFi flicks ever made. Despite a stellar cast, it was largely ignored when it was released in 1980. What interests me now is that the film seems to have influenced James Cameron on both Terminator and Aliens. In fact several scenes are very similar. The destruction of the Psychotic robot Hector and the scene where the soldier from the future blows up the Terminator are very similar. In Saturn 3 the robot chases the two main characters around trying to catch them through the floor grate. That seems very similar to several scenes in Aliens. I've never seen any comment by Cameron that this film influenced him, but it seems hard to miss.<br />Even if you are not interested in the connection to Terminator or Aliens, this is worth getting. The reproduction to this DVD is excellent. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it is a bit slow at times and, other than Harvey Keitel, the acting is a bit. . .well, not up to either the standards of Kirk Douglas or Farrah Fawcett. I'm not being snide either, I consider both excellent actors.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This soundtrack is definitely one of the most powerful soundtracks you could listen to.  It expresses the action on the screen so thoroughly that any song alone can make you laugh or cry, because of the feeling Howard Shore captured when writing this.<BR>     I love the theme &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; because it is so truly hobbit it's almost unbelievable.  I also like Enya's, &quot;May It Be.&quot;  Very beautiful.  I would highly recommend this soundtrack to anyone.
6304539258|4.0|Lucas (and ILM) did a fantastic job of improving the effects.  I don't like some of the minor changes to the story line, but it's still star wars, one of the greatest movies ever.
B00005IC52|5.0|This movie scared me to death when I first saw it. Of course, I always knew it as Stranger in the House when I first saw it during its many cable runs in the early 80's. <br />One other thing that amazes me is that none of the reviews here has mentioned the history of this film and probably one of the the reasons why this film is so underrated. At the same time when this movie was released in 1975, a serial killer struck at a the University of Florida by bludgeoning a couple of female nursing students with a baseball bat. That killer was none other than Ted Bundy, thus this movie was pulled from circulation for a while because the murders made shocking national headlines, and probably ( though I can't confirm, is why it was changed to Stranger in the House). <br />Overall, a great movie.
0425173895|3.0|I have always been one of the few who do not think this is Agatha Christie's best book, ro even among them. The plot in itself is pretty average, many of the characters boring. the murder is not at all original. The only thing which is brilliant (and i do mean. it is the best device i've ever read) is the final and stunning twists at the end. it is the best twist i have ever read, and suspect i will EVER read. So so so good. But then, no book deserves five starts for a simple twist. Apart from the end, this book is pretty average.
B000002C1W|3.0|This would have been a great David Gilmour solo album. OK, maybe not solo since he needed an army of hired helpers to try to sound like Floyd. As Waters said Gilmour has done a &quot;fair forgery&quot;. To do this, it took him 19 musicians (including himself) to pull it off. Also, At the time, Rick Wright was not a full member of the band. He was paid a fee as a studio musician. He was among the FIVE musicians playing keyboards on the album. Neither Wright nor Mason contributed anything to the writing of the album. This is not Pink Floyd but it is also not a bad album. Yes, it lacks the attitude, substance, intellect of Waters. It shines with some gorgeous production, wonderful guitar solos, georgeous keyboards and a more pop sense (I mean that in a good way) than the real Floyd albums. History showed that Gilmour did have good intentions and invited Wright to join the band as a full member, but that was after the album was done. All in all, not a bad album but kind of bland if you like the powerful Floyd of old. I'd rather hear the intensity of Water's solo material. Hopefully we will get the chance to see all members together again.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is a simply wonderful album, certainly the best of 2001, possibly for many many years. <br />The whole album has an understated tone to the music, and it's mellow, easy to listen to, and beautiful. <br />Unusually this album has no dud tracks. Most albums have a least one that isn't so good, that you don't quite like as much, but with this album, every single song is of a very high quality, and cannot be faulted. There are different styles and tones to some of the songs, from Don't Think of Me to My Lover's Gone to Isobel and Hunter. But each one is beautifully unique, and a superb song. <br />My personal favourite is probably Isobel, which i love for it's somewhat slow and brooding tone, with it's poetic but hard-hitting lyrics. It's more like a story, sung, than a poem sung, which is what most songs are. It's a tune you can't get out of your head, with the deep tune going in wonderful contrast with her voice. <br />Another real winner is Hunter, a slightly more up-beat and &quot;poppy&quot; tune, but one with with haunting lyrics and great music. My Lover's Gone is a slightly lower-key song, more...mystical, with slightly sad undertones. If songs could be placed as locations, this one would be a lonely English moor in early morning, with the mist drawing away over the landscape and the dew covering the grass, with spider's webs sparkling in the bushes like strands of spun glass, with a person staring off to the ocean in the distance, past the hills. <br />There is little left to say about this album. It is a great one, which everyone should love. the lyrics are beautiful, the music is beautiful. And Dido's voice, contrary to the belief imposed by the name of the album, IS that of an angel. <br />Buy it.
B000002ITM|4.0|First of all, here's where I stand.  Testament is my favorite heavy metal band, and The Ritual is one of my favorite albums of all time.  Here's why.<br />Everything begins with a brooding \\"Signs of Chaos,\\" an eerie-sounding guitar solo, foreshadowing the things to come.  It leads right into \\"Electric Crown,\\" which has an element of Metallica to it, but that's exactly where that ends.  The album continues with a heavier offering, \\"So Many Lies.\\"  Going on, we encounter \\"Let Go Of My World,\\" an oddly-timed bit with an absolutely incredible guitar solo.  There are quite a few surprises, up until the very end.<br />The compositions on this release are wonderful.  There may be one or two weaker songs, with some riffs keeping with trite key progressions, but these weaknesses can be overlooked without much regret.<br />One thing that cannot be overlooked is the lead guitar work - Alex Skolnik shines on every one of the tracks with melodically complex and technically stunning solos.  The highlights for me are \\"Agony\\", where the solo reflects the song title very appropriately, and the ballad \\"Return To Serenity,\\" for which the guitar solo is long and varied, building up to its resolution - similar in compositional approach to such pieces as Scorpions' Still Loving You and Pantera's The Sleep.<br />The vocals are also quite good.  I'm not a fan of the later vocal styling that Testament adopted, and this is very little like it.  There is a clear melody in the singing, but it has a definite growl to it, which conveys quite well the adrenaline high that the singer experiences through his music.<br />The production quality is mediocre, but not so bad as to take away from the good elements of the record.  If you play this on the most average speakers/headphones, you will be able to make out what the band's trying to play/say.  Quality may be subpar, but at least it's consistent.<br />And on a final note, this album is not to be compared to any of Metallica's efforts.  Metallica could only wish they had the guts to put out something like this, especially nowdays; their lead guitar, for example, does not even begin to compare.  I'm amazed that people actually say that this album is inferior to Metallica's self-titled release.  Production-wise, perhaps, but definitely not musically.

Just prior to D-Day, six women set out from England to cripple German communications in France. At every turn they  have road blocks thrown up before them but how they overcome these obsticles makes an interesting and fascinating story. Six set out but try to guess the number that survive.
B00003CXBK|5.0|And my adoration has only increased with repeated viewings of the movie.   <br />Normally I don't like anime very much.  It's not that the animation itself isn't usually fabulous, because it is.  Genrally, however, I really do not like the storylines.<br />This movie however, is absolutely magnificent.  The story is so deep, so moving, and so profound that this is actually one of my top ten favorite movies.  The spiritual ideas expressed in this story could change a persons life if they let it.  <br />Watch this movie, &quot;with eyes unclouded by hate&quot; and you will see what I mean.  It is a MUST for all spiritually minded people!

6305546789|4.0|I was so excited to rent this movie. I wanted to see it so bad because, they showed parts of it in Scream (that was the best movie ever). This was okay. I didn't think that they would show so much nudity and otha stuff. I don't think that it should be named a classic but, it was better than most horror movies. It kept you at the edge of your seat and kept you thinking. It wasn't as scary as Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer but it was entertaining.
B000001EAQ|4.0|This is a Bunk and Roll and Rhythm and Blues blues Techno music.  It has the basic four and three chord progressions that make up rock and U2, but the juice is in the production and the technique.<br />It is heavyer than R&amp;B and Rock and Roll, but has a techno-punk edge to its sound.  Discotheque isn't a disco peice.<br />I guess you have to be in the right mood to enjoy this CD.<br />I forgive you, U2, for this album.
006092988X|4.0|In Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Smith uses the descriptive style to depict Francie Nolan's story about her life well. Throughout the novel, readers are able to get a vivid picture of the struggles, hardships, and joys in the life of Francie. As the novel progresses, Francie faces the usual struggles of a poor family, worrying about where the money for food for the week will come from, and if her as well as her brother Neely Nolan will be able to acquire a higher education. An example of this is when the Nolan's are at the soda shop Katie Nolan, says, &quot;They never had enough to eat, never had right cloths. The best I could do wasn't enough&quot; (351). This passage shows that the Nolan's do not have enough money for everything needed and at times their family would struggle making Katie feel that she had not done enough for her children. Smith enables Francie to tell her coming of age story in a way that makes the reader know just as much about Francie and Francie herself does. When Francie speaks it seems that she is speaking to you and wants you to understand her pain, and joys allowing Smith to let the world know just how life was for some families growing up. Even though the Nolan family had nothing in the beginning, through hard work and some suffering, their family was able to gain a higher status than the generations before them, thus showing the reader that if you have strong determination, good will, and a sense of direction about where you want your life to take you, you will succeed and gain even greater happiness. Throughout the novel, Smith captures the readers mind as she takes them on a journey through the life of a child in Brooklyn, as seen through the eyes of Francie. Betty Smith's novel, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, as an astonishing descriptive style. For that reason, the reader is able to make a connection with Francie as if they were her very own best friend and she was confiding in then all the memories of her childhood and teen life.
0788815490|5.0|not R-rated,and that would have been suitable for the whole family. Amazing how a truly beautiful and near=perfect film had to be needlessly sexualized. The first scene in the subway elevator, was that supposed to have happened,was it a dream,was it in the book? (maybe I should read it,but I cannot even get past a James first page.). All the way to the very end, it was perfect,terrific costumes in every scene,old London,parties, family money intrigues,1910 motorcars, Venice gondolas, subtley manipulative characters. Milly was more and more sympathetic to the sad end. Susan (E. McGovern) seemed  little more than an empty mirage for some reason.Then  the last final bedroom scene,which should have been toned down,too, which would have made it a lot better,along with a family rating. Still one of most beautiful movies ever. Why can't women,and men too, wear hats like this today? Compared to these characters in this era,we dress like slobs with zero taste!!

B00005UWBQ|2.0|This plotless sequel is a disappointing let-down from the well-constructed and believable JURASSIC PARK.  It depends on violent special effects as an excuse for being.  The only bright spot is Jeff Goldblum's acting.
B00005RYQO|3.0|If your into little cc'd foreign cars trying to be real drag racing machines, then this movie is for you.  If your into big cubed American iron gear-head driven machines, you will most likely be disappointed.  These boys know about chips, NOS and low profile tires but don't have a clue about hardware that resides inside engines.  Dom even talks about being &quot;scared&quot; to drive the only muscle car in the movie.  What's that tell 'ya?  As far as there being lots of &quot;babes&quot; in the movie as the movie jacket would lead you to believe, there are not all that many.  Pretty yes but not the hordes implied.  As to the drag race scenes, where else but in this movie will you ever see 4 cars race side by side?  Give me a break!  Now after saying all that, it was pretty much worth sitting through it all just to see the Charger make it's run.  A big block with no doubt, probably not a hemi but at least a 383 worked-up.  The wheelie Dom pulled was the best I can remember seeing in a movie for a long long time.  Dom actually turned out to be a guy you would like to know for real.  Will I keep the movie?  Yes.  Now if they would only make a sequel with more than one real car.  We can only wait and see.
B00003CXXR|3.0|This second effort at a sequel to JURASSIC PARK is a considerable imptrovement over THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, but from the science fiction standpoint there is litt;e original to it.  I've written better science fiction plots myself--several of them.  It seems not to occur to any of these hacks that the modern world is a totally alien ecology for dinosaurs, which could comprise an important plot element.
B00003CXXS|1.0|This movie was just a sorry excuse to show off the latest dinosaur fx.  The characters go to the forbidden island much against the council of everyone (big surprise).  Half of the original crew that lands on the island gets eaten (big surprise).  What bothered me was that when someone gets eaten right in front of one of the other characters in the movie, they act completely nonchalant in the next scene.  Our dear friend Billy just got eaten alive in front of our eyes, but hey did you catch that Mets game?  Of course all the characters that are central to the 'plot' survive.  Can anyone tell me why a 35 foot tall dinosaur even cares about a human that wouldn't even offer enough food to get stuck between it's teeth?  It would care even less with all the 'fight' that such a small calorie intake is putting up.  Mabye it will take one more film to make everyone realize just how far south this series has gone since the first one.  Just go ahead and make it a TV series and kill it off already.

B00005NW02|5.0|Is the sophomore effort by SOAD as good as their eponymous debut?  Absolutely! As a matter of fact, it bests the first album in just about every way.  The songs are strong, melodic and fierce, and the instrumentation is much improved.  Every song on this disc is good to great, with prison song, needles, chop suey, science, toxicity, psycho and the immense aerials leading the way.  The songs are so good simply because they are a breath of fresh air at a time when conformity and sameness permeate the music business.  From the alternating crunch/beauty of Chop suey, toxicity and aerials, to the sheer variety of sounds they ... coax out of their instruments (sounds like Daron Malakian is playing a mandolin on Chop Suey), these songs sound like no other.  In addition, Serj's voice is an additional instrument as he seems to have several different styles (from deep-throated growl to pleading wail; the only other hard rock vocalist with a range like Serj is Glenn Danzig).

B000056NX5|4.0|This is an absolutely terrific production in many ways.  First, the overall look is fresh and vibrant.  It's well directed and the costumes are terrific.  Each character's costumes really make a statement about the character, a simple shirt and khakis for Jesus, a sexy but not slutty dress for the conflicted Mary, black leather for tormented Judas, a sleveless camoflauge shirt for the rebellious Simon Zealot.  It's simply brilliant on every technical level.  What most impresses me about the production is how the director manages to keep intact the feel of a theatrical, not cinematic, experience, while using the video to escape all the theater's limitations.  The sets are very bare, yet still complement the action on stage without overwhelming it.  Particularly brilliant is the cross made of stage lights.<br />OK, onto the cast.  Renee Castle is the absolute best Mary Magdalene, period, end of story.  Her acting and singing are both superior.  Everytime she's on screen she grabs your attention-portraying a wealth of emotions in a single facial expression.  \\"I Don't Know How to Love Him\\" is gorgeously sung, and she uses it to really give insight into Mary's feelings, while avoiding the overpowering Diva tendencies of other people who have sung this song.  Her \\"Could We Start Again Please\\" will make you want to cry.<br />I loved Jerome Predon as Judas.  His voice is powerful, and he really makes you understand the complex nature of this character.  He manages to convey every aspect of the character, Judas' cynicism and self-hatred, his loneliness, his compassion, his alienation from Christ and the other disciples, while still making us see his deep love for them.  Actually, Judas, not Jesus, is really the protagonist of Jesus Christ Superstar.  It's no easy feat to make an audience sympathize with Judas, but Predon pulls it off.<br />Also of note in a smaller role is Tony Vincent as Simon Zealot.  He really only has one big moment in the Hosanna sequence but he makes the most of it.  Extrodinary voice.<br />Unfortunately the rest of the cast isn't quite as strong. Glen Carter does a very good, but not fantastic Jesus.  My main complaint about him is his constant use of falsetto.  Obviously he thinks his falsetto is one of his strong points-which it's not.  It just sounds screechy, and thus ruins some of the most emotionial moments in the play, like the Gethesmane number, which is otherwise brilliant.  If he'd have stuck with his fine normal range, he'd have been perfect.<br />The other bad performances are Pilate and Rik Mayall as Herod.  The guy playing Pilate overacts laughably, with his eyes nearly bugging out of his head at every take.  His voice is great, but his expressions are like something out of a cartoon.  And, speaking of cartoon, Rik Mayall is God-awful (pardon the pun) as Herod.  The man can't sing, act, or dance.  I've never been wild about Herod's number anyway-it's OK, but having that big comedy number at that place in the play completely cuts the dramatic build from the arrest to the crucifixion.  In my opinion it should be cut from every production, or at least moved to earlier in the play.<br />Overall, though, this is the version to see.  I'd really call it four and a half stars, just short of perfect, but that isn't available.
0385505833|4.0|This is a quick reading book.  The characters are very believable.  I, personally, didn't see a problem with them wanting to &quot;Skip Christmas&quot;.  Heck sometimes I think that would be fun.<br />However, I must say that I found the ending to be a bit predictable.  Even thought it was predictable, it was still humorous.<br />I, myself, have never been a big fan of John Grishim...but this book was the exception to that rule.

0060392886|5.0|I found this a very good book.  I liked how the chapters were written by a different member of the band and alternated.<br />The chapters were very articulate and well worded as were they well thought out. A great book.<br />My only pet peeve is I felt that it was just kind of left open ended. But I guess that IS life.
0156711427|3.0|E.M. Forster's 320-page novel probes the intimate workings of the human heart and mind, especially when brought into the stark, Victorian contrast of cross-cultural prejudice.  Set in India during the Raj (British imperialsim at its height and worst), the story reveals how Anglos strive to maintain a proper distance from the natives they felt destined to rule. The frustrated Indians--themselves fragmented by religion and caste--struggle in various ways to be accepted as fully-accredited persons by the dominant race, who dismiss them categorically as &quot;niggers.&quot;  Each sub-society seeks to perpetuate its social survival, for self-image is precious to all members of humanity.  Still the Anglo community has a long memory of perceived disloyalty, while that of Indians is even longer.  Despite decades of uneasy coexistence between the Masters and the Conquered, sparks of rebellion quickly ignite when fanned by the flames of confusion, false accusation, racial bigotry and social polarization.  <br />  The two naive Englishwomen who have booked passage to India should have read a manual on social survival skills; it simply will not Do to upset the proven status quo--however it seems tipped in the favor of Western power. The herd instinct must prevail or all is lost; woe to those Anglos who defy experience and tradition in dealing with treacherous, scheming, unreliable or childlike natives.  Whom to trust and whom to defend--whom to choose as a loyal ally, a friend or even a life's partner?  How can one make these critical decisions in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion, <BR>cultural snobbery and religious extremism? <br /> The normally straightforward British lifestyle is suddenly complicated in a myriad ways as soon as one is transported to the steaming sub- continent.  What is it about India which brings out the worst or hidden weakness of the British?  Is it safe, wise or even possible for natives to seek lasting relationships with Anglos?<BR>Will it ever be an equal partnershp? Can the East truly accept and peacefully coexist with the West and vice-versa?  This is a novel of deep instrospection, as readers are forced to analyze the devastating ripples of human error and frailty.  Despite many instances of captivating dialogue and fast-paced events, PASSAGE TO INDIA remains a classic psychological novel.
0375507507|5.0|\\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\" is a wonderfully written memoir about a young woman growing up in Africa in the '70s and '80s. It's \\"The Liar's Club\\" mixed with \\"The Poisonwood Bible.\\"  Fuller's family were white settlers that chose to live on the outskirts of civilization during turbulent years of civil war.  The dangers the family took for granted - terrorists, land mines, all manner of poisonous creatures - are almost incomprehensible.  Fuller's family fought to maintain white rule in Rhodesia, and she does an excellent job of handling the sensitive subject.  The Fuller family is colorful in the extreme, and Fuller's writing style brings them beautifully and lovingly to life.  Make no mistake, this was a tough childhood, and at times it is difficult to remain non-judgmental about the dangers to which the Fuller parents were willing to expose their children.  Nevertheless, it is a compelling and very well-written story.
B00005R87Q|1.0|What can I say? I was sick and my girlfriend decided she'd rent a movie for us to watch. So, she comes back with this.<br />In short: bad plot, bad dialog, bad movie.<br />In slightly: This is a movie for kids who take their car and add a 4\\" diameter exhaust to it so that they look 'cool'. Lots of loud noises, a soundtrack filled with Limp Bizkit-wannabes, and not much else. There isn't even much racing in this movie, and those that are are over so quickly they're just boring.<br />There's scenes that make no sense (what's with the cut to Vin Diesel and his girl during the police raid? it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie), it ends unfinished (you spend all that time developping a love interest, and then you aren't going to let us know what happens?)<br />It just sucks, but there's no accounting for taste.
B00005LOUS|4.0|This Christmas movie opened to great success and reviews.  Based on the famous Dr. Seuss book 'The Grinch Who Stole Christmas' (which has almost become synonimous to the occasion itself) it has The Grinch (Carrey) as a green monster glaring down at the people of Whosville, despising Christmas above all else.  Whosville is a place where its people celebrate Christmas amid a blizzard of consumerism where presents are what the holidays are all about.  The set design is absolutely glorious, managing to capture the magic of the book and particularly excelling in its exagerrated design of a land gaudily decorated in bright lights and over-the-top Christmas trees.  However, hope lies in Cindy-Lou Who who still belives in the spirit of Christmas.<br />This movie has plenty of strong points, although Carrey's performance would have to be one of them.  Once again as he did in 'The Truman Show', he demonstrates that he can often trascend a role's apparent limitations.  He is quite simply wonderful as the bitter Grinch, hidden under some fantastic make-up effects, with witty comments often overriding the syrupy ending to make this enjoyable for kids and adults alike.  It is this genuinely witty humour that really makes it stand out from the rest of the holiday movies.<br />Incidently, the song 'Where Are You Christmas' is sung by Faith Hill.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This is a really good CD if you like a DMB sounding type music.  I have traded a lot of his stuff and some of his best works he hasn't released and the guitar playing and backround is much better from the stuff I got this way.  The CD isn't as good period as his other stuff.  So is ummary good CD but if you want to hear him at his best see him live or download some of his stuff from concerts.
B000024D4R|4.0|Pink Floyd's 1977 attack on society, \\"Animals\\" was produced right at the time that tensions in the band were beginning to peak; bassist Roger Waters had become the dominating principle songwriter, guitarist David Gilmour's ego was beginning to climax (\\"I was the driving musical force...\\"), and keyboardist Rick Wright was experiencing a bad case of writer's block, all of this leaving drummer Nick Mason in the dark.<br />But the friction between the members of Pink Floyd couldn't have come at a better time; Waters was ready to write an album that dared to attack politics and society, a record full of venomous bombardment on such political figures as Margaret Thatcher, and censorship campaigner Mary Whitehouse.<br />The bitterness within Pink Floyd itself certainly shows on \\"Animals.\\" But for such a rude and outlandish album, that compares everyday human evil to the behavior of animals, it certainly helps the stunning atmosphere.<br />Roger Waters' singing and lyrical/musical writing abilities foreshadow what directions he would take with his solo career (which kicked off in the 1980's). Nevertheless, \\"Animals\\" is a disturbing album that literally breaks down the behavior of human beings and compares them to that of dogs, pigs, and sheep; the \\"dogs\\" are those that will step on anyone to get to the top, the \\"pigs\\" are the ones that force their beliefs on the meak, while the \\"sheep\\" are forced to take the abuse, easily compared to the events of the cult headed by the \\"Reverend\\" Jim Jones.<br />Great rock music for the cravers of outlandish lyrics, as opposed to, quoting the Ramones, \\"Tenth-generation Elton John, tenth-generation Led Zeppelin, or just over-produced.\\"<br />\\"Animals\\" is most likely one of the many roots of inspiration for other acts that dared to criticize the most powerful figures in the world.
0380002930|5.0|This book is amazing. It has elements of everyday life mixed with human compare and contrasts. It's tale of adventure and hardships are greatly blended with homelife element. It may be about a group of rabbits but it is one of the most amazing books ever written.
B00005U122|5.0|While i think the music in the Pulse video is very good and the lighting show good too, i always thought the Pulse video showed that you need a cozier venue than the Earls court venue. The band seemed elevated too high and the fans so far away that they never really seemed that they were much into the concert. Waters in the Flesh dvd taped in Oregon is much closer to the fans. All of Waters band mates (Jon Carin appears in both) are excellent musicians and every bit as good as the Gilmour PF. All that's really needed is for Gilmour to show up at one of Waters concerts and play lead guitar and you would have the best PF shows ever. White and Bramhall make for a excellent lead guitar duo and it doesnt hurt that 2 of the female singers are good looking. It was also good to hear a couple songs from the &quot;Animals&quot; cd as the Gilmour PF is apparently not allowed to perform those Waters tunes. All in all i would rather see the Waters PF versus the Gilmour PF.
6305165912|5.0|Although it has been commented on in an earlier review, when The Dude makes out his check at the Ralphs (for .69 cents) it takes on newly bizarre signifigance.  Ten years to the day of the 911, The Dude makes his check out on September 11, 1991 as the television shows Bush Sr. sabre rattling prior to Desert Shield/Desert Storm.  Much like the final shot of \\"Barton Fink\\" (the pelican diving *kerplunkt!* right into the ocean as the dollface on the beach raises her hand to shade her eyes), it's a bit of cinematic effluvia that captures perfectly the Coen's overall sensibility (call it quirky, but that barely scratches the surface.<br />Aside from the faux Philip Marlow stylings (reminiscent of Robert Altman's \\"The Long Goodbye\\" in my opinion), the film's father/son dynamic (the Big Lebowski/The Dude) is a kind of riff on \\"Rebel Without a Cause.\\"   The classic scene between the the two Jeffrey Lebowski's: Jeff Bridges and David Huddleston, as the Dude tries to explain the situation with the rug is a pitched battle between father and son, between the generations that plays like the world's most generic scolding, the place where father and son diverge and find each other lacking in the way they live their respective lives. <br />The films of the Coen's don't always get noticed for the sublety of certain scenes or shots... they still have that aura of the film school brat.  But the simple, unnoticed callbacks like the the Dude's choice in bank checks: whale prints.  This image is called back later in the film on the soundtrack as whale songs play through The Dude's cheapo tape player while he gets pleasantly stoned in the candlelit tub.  Pretty sweet, hardly noticed (unlike the frequent callback of the various names for  genitalia)... thank you DVD!<br />This is an incredibly complex film once you get past the pot smoke and mirrors the Coens like to throw up to obscure their literary source material and the cinematic homages that play throughout.  Pretty damn cool... Totally worth owning on DVD... <br />\\"Obviously you're not a golfer.\\"
B00005A1PR|5.0|To quote Arie's song *Wonderful*, \\"you inspire me.\\" I have continually played this CD since my purchase in early August and it  would have been earlier (I saw her sing Video on some obscure tv show early last winter and was searching for the album ever since)if possible. Her songs are passionate and heart felt and the beats are uplifting yet relazing. When listing the best parts of the CD*Brown Skin*, *Strength, COurage, &Wisdom*, and *I See God in You* come to mind, but then again, so does every song India Arie has written (except Video- play it a couple of times and you'll notice the pop style of that one song that can become an annoyance). All in all, India Arie is a diamond in the rough who deserves to win all 7 of her Grammy nominations.
185984054X|5.0|I have always thought very highly of Mother Theresa, until a few years ago, when I visited one of her clinics on a medical trip. It was a nursery, filled to the brim with pathetic crying babies, or those too scrawny and weak to even move. Many of them lay in urine soaked beds. I started to cry at the sight of their misery, it was just so appalling, and mind you, this is not the first time I have seen sick babies or dire poverty.<br />But what was most shocking was when one of the doctors in my group asked where the money had gone. She apparently had been here last year, and she and others raised $25,000 for this particular nursery--they had sent the money a few months before we arrived to buy cribs, diapers, formula and medicine. The nursery was exactly the same now as it had been a year ago.<br />The sister in charge said something to the effect that they had to give the money to the main MC office--or something like that. They never saw a penny of it. One of the babies died during our visit--of starvation. He could have been saved very easily.<br />My doubts began at that time, and I read more about Mother Theresa, how her nuns were spreading AIDS and hepatitis by using unclean needles in their clinics. You can buy bleach to sterilize needles for just a few pennies, but yet, they didn't even have that. Where then, does the millions go that is donated to this woman and her charity?<br />If she believes that suffering is so holy, then one would think she would have wanted to be treated when she got sick, the same way that the poor are treated. But instead, Mother Theresa got top notch care. I guess when one is on the fast track to sainthood, they don't have to do their penance and suffering like the rest of us.<br />I don't think that she was an evil woman, and maybe she meant to do well at one time. But keeping medical care and food away from the hungry and sick is a crime. She became known for caring for the dying because that's what people did best in her clinic--die. True, many of them lived on the street, and she did offer than food and shelter. However, why allow someone to die when you have the means to save them?<br />I would like to know where all of the money that Mother Theresa got in donations has gone to. If she is a true Christian, she would have returned the donation made by Keating back to its rightful owners, the people he stole it from. But she didn't. She never even acknowledged it, only pleaded for clemency for the criminal who robbed 17,000 people of their life savings. One truly has to wonder about the \\"Christian\\" mind of such a person.<br />At any rate, my personal experience has convinced me that Hitchens is on to something. The sisters were basically doing nothing for these babies, not even holding them. Not even changing the worn cloth diapers that they wore. It was totally disgusting. Just waiting for them to die, what Mother Theresa does best.
B000001FN1|5.0|Whether due to a longer hiatus taken to write new material in between tours or the acquisition of Tommy Bolan on guitar, Triumph and Agony is a quantum leap above its predecessors in terms of production, musical diversity, atmosphere, and most significantly, songwriting. Though the preceding album True as Steel featured colorful songs and was a notable improvement after the lacklustre Hellbound, Warlock made the greatest qualitative progression on Triumph and Agony, which stands as its undisputed masterpiece. Never before or since has Doro sung such an exceptional catalogue of songs and to this day this album remains the crowning achievement of her career. From the opening a cappella anthemic chant of 'All We Are,' it is instantly audible that Warlock has progressed tremendously from earlier efforts in fashioning exciting and powerful musical intros.<BR>Even on straightforward rockers like 'Three Second Warning' and 'I Rule the Ruins,' the choruses are melodic and instantly memorable, a significant advancement from the uniformity of aggressive yet pedestrian metal rockers which characterized the preponderence of Warlock's prior output. Another no-frills rocker, \\"East Meets West,\\" makes adroit use of shrieking unison bends to complement the raging chorus and evince unfettered fury. However, the album's true brilliance lies in groundbreaking songs like 'Kiss of Death' and 'Metal Tango' which expand beyond the band's previous parochial musical range through contrasting tempo changes, sophisticated accoustic guitar arrangements, and by incorporating unlikely Spanish musical influences on the latter track. 'Kiss of Death' stands as one of Warlock's all time greatest works, with its quiet, ominous opening foreshadowing the simmering enmity implicit in Doro's lyrics. Like Metallica's 'One' and Ozzy's 'Diary of a Madman,' the haunting intro is employed not solely to exhibit musical versatility but more importantly, to underscore the portending horror underneath which explodes upon the seams with the sudden application of distortion pedals for the exhilerating verse bridge. As a consequence of this color, Doro's tale of a vampire creature with insatiable lust transcends the campy occultism of Warlock's previous albums. Whereas on earlier tracks demonic imagery was utilized as an obligatory lyrical backdrop for traditional, non-AOR metal, on 'Kiss of Death,' it truly seems Doro is enraged and we no longer doubt the sincerity of her screams not just for shock value but in evoking the rampage of her demonic persona as \\"the nightmare you will not survive.\\" While the absence of such chromatic songs like this deprived Warlock's previous works from garnering serious attention or respectability, the appearance of 'Kiss of Death' on the fourth album is hardly belated; experience and progression were imperative for Warlock to attain the musical sophistication and exuberance present on this fantastic track.<BR>  Notwithstanding these high points, Triumph and Agony's true apogee is the ambitious 'Time for Love.' Like 'Kiss of Death,' it features another deceptively tranquil introduction masking the unbridled emotions, yet there are longer verses with audacious accoustic guitar and piano accompaniment (the latter courtesy of Doro) presaging the explosive chorus. Unless one includes the raucous finale of 'Love Song' from True as Steel, 'Time for Love' is Warlock's first mature power ballad. Significantly, Doro's first serious lyrical foray into romance is also her best, for instead of indulging in the trite themes of unrequited love which would dominate her subsequent solo albums, here she gives rock music's most rudimentary topic a provocative and creative twist while retaining the familiar gothic setting of Warlock's past albums: the tale of an irreproachable Viking (or in this case more likely a Valkyrie) who has encountered her first fear in love. Although apparently impervious in battle, Doro's character must succumb to this temptation otherwise she will be forever tormented by being \\"afraid of love.\\" Insisting that she is a \\"lion that has never been tamed,\\" she engages in a moving, contemplating self-analysis whereby she swallows her warrior pride and vows to \\"make time for love.\\" <BR>  The album's only flaw which prevents it from receiving a five star rating is the otherwise conventional and unimaginative \\"Touch of Evil,\\" which instantly recalls the uninspired filler material of preceding albums which Warlock had commendably largely largely transcended throughout Triumph and Agony. Nevertheless, this is only a minor blemish in a record which easily ranks in my opinion among the top five metal albums of 1987 and top twenty of the 80's.   <BR>  Triumph and Agony fittingly concludes with the moving ballad \\"Fur Immer,\\" a significant track which, although musically consistent with the haunting ambience of the album, in may ways symbolizes the end of Warlock and the commencement of Doro's solo career. By the release of Triumph and Agony, Warlock had essentially become a vehicle for Doro with her bandmates relegated in the background, a fact particularly illustrated in the video to Fur Immer (as well as the album's cover), where Doro is the only band member depicted. Likewise, Fur Immer heralded the mellower, ballad-oriented direction Doro would subsequently pursue in her solo albums (although without the same efficacity), particularly on \\"The Trees\\" from Force Majeure. Given Doro's no longer underplayed dominance, it was thus inevitable that Warlock disbanded not long after the release of Triumph and Agony. However, her inferior solo recordings would quickly indicate that it was hardly her sole contributions which made Triumph and Agony the artistic zenith of Doro's entire career. While her solo albums featured exceptional session musicians, whether due to Doro's determination to achieve more commercial appeal (like the desperately Top 40-aspirant track \\"Unholy Love\\" from her self- titled second solo album) or her inability to prevent constant lineup rotations, there was a unique chemistry in Triumph and Agony which she has never been able to recapture again.

0812550757|5.0|Though this is only the second novel I have read in the Ender series by Orson Scott Card, I think it is probably the best.<br />While reading \\"Ender's Game\\" will clarify parts of this novel, it is not strictly necessary to understand it. This novel takes place three thousand years after the events of \\"Ender's Game\\" by which time humanity has colonized dozens of planets (confederated as the \\"Hundred Worlds\\") and there has been no contact with an alien species since Ender destroyed the buggers (an insect like alien race) thousands of years ago... Until Lustitania is discovered.<br />A new colony is established on Lusitania to study a new race called, informally, the \\"piggies.\\" The colonists begin to study the alien race but this time humanity is determined to do it right, to prevent another war. So, strict rules are set up for the alien anthropologists (xenologers) to follow. Everything goes reasonably well for several years until a discovery is made and the piggies kill one of the xenologers and plant a tree in him, later the same man's son is ritually killed in the same way.<br />The major theme of the novel is how people deal with the \\"foreigner\\"; violence, wonder, awe? Science fiction is particularly well equipped, as a genre, to explore themes like this because it can use exaggerated or strange examples (i.e. aliens instead of Russians or some other Earth nationality). <br />Other interesting things in the novel include the fact that the Roman Catholic Church still continues to exist and the Speaker of the Dead has become something of a humanistic religion that is about truly understanding a dead person and then speaking their death truthfully, no more and no less. The main character, Ender, presents an interesting personality; he is at once the man who destroyed an entire alien species and he is also the only person who have really understood them and made it possible for the rest of humanity to understood. Such a complicated, tragic figure is intriguing. <br />Though I haven't read the rest of the Ender series (Xenocide, Children of the Mind, Ender's Shadow etc...), I think this will probably be the best one for the way in which it explored the age old idea; how do you deal with someone that appears to be different but who may in fact be similar to you?<br />I plan to read, \\"Xenocide,\\" and, \\"Children of the Mind,\\" soon. Please see my review of, \\"Ender's Game.\\"
B00005ASQ1|5.0|Apparently this film didn't do as well as expected, and some people have dismissed it as 'Good Will Hunting with literature' but that should not detract from the fact that it is a brilliant well written, well directed film. Connery gives one of his best performances as reclusive novelist William Forrester (based on J.D. Sallinger) who privately tutors a young Jamal who is starting out at a Prep School of high repute and who is encontering covert racism and academic jealousy from one of it's lecturers (F. Murray Abraham).
B00003CXP1|3.0|Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream plays the least intelligent character (Sara Goldfarb) in any movie I have ever seen where the character's lack of intelligence is not made explicitly clear to the audience or the other characters.  She inhabits a fantasy world, where it takes no more than a half a day's diet to get her refrigerator to talk to her.  She lives to watch an over the top television game show/self-improvement infomercial.  (There is no small amount of irony that there is a self-improvement message in the infomercial that is completely lost on Sara.  She is caught up in the flicker of the image on the screen and little else.)<br />Sara complains of being old and lonely and it is touching when she does so.  That said, the primary reason for Sara's isolation is a complete lack of inner resources.  Why isn't she taking classes, or helping out a working mom with after school care or working part time in a flower shop or helping out at a homeless shelter? Why doesn't she own a dog, or a canary or a fish?  These are questions that the filmmakers don't go anywhere near.  It is unclear whether Sara is deluded into thinking that she is going to be on her favorite infomercial or not, but either way there is a conjunction of her fantasy life with her real life which is enough to send her into a delusional spiral.  Since Sara is incapable of coming up with something to aspire to on her own, when given the possibility of a dream she grasps at the weakest of straws with both hands.  <br />Jared Leto plays Sara's son Harry.  Other than being stunningly beautiful and \\"loving his mother\\", the Harry character has few redeeming characteristics.  Yes, he is not out and out evil, but if he is the standard for goodness, lord help us all.  He regularly steals Sara's one possession that means anything to her, her television, forcing Sara to schlep blocks and blocks in order to buy it back out of hock.  This is not presented as a joke but more of \\"that's-the-way-Harry-is\\" statement.  This is the first scene of the movie, confirming that Sara is in a full delusional state, denying the reality that is occurring right in front of her eyes.  <br />Jennifer Connelly (Marion) is the love interest for Jared Leto.  (She is a good match.  She is as pretty as he is.)  She appears to be a dropout bankrolled by well-to-do parents from whom she is estranged.  She lies to them about being in therapy preferring to sleeping with her skuzzy analyst for money rather than trying for some kind of reconciliation with her parents.  Rather than facing her addiction problems, she is willing to be sexually used in the most degrading manner.  While such things unfortunately do happen, we don't get much of a sense that this sinking in squalor is much of a struggle for her.  She goes down the tubes with barely a bubble of protest.  <br />And finally there is Tyrone, Harry's friend.  But Tyrone is black, so we don't get much of a sense of his story and his struggles (if any).  We do know he once had a sweet relationship with a loving mother and has a sexy girl friend who he'd rather ignore to do drugs than mess around with.  <br />Requiem for a Dream is designed to provoke strong reactions either positive or negative.  The drug scenes are graphic and strong as are the scenes of Ellen Burstyn's breakdown and Jennifer Connelly's degradation.  The problem with the film is that the aspirations of the characters are shallow.  It is hard to imagine these characters without drugs.  It is a sad and pathetic thing when one winds up agreeing with characters that drugs give their lives meaning.
068817776X|4.0|This is the true story of a woman's struggle for survival against powerful and sometimes seemingly unsurmountable circumstances. Unlike some holocaust stories, there is a relatively positive outcome  - - not in the romantically sentimental sense of \\" she lived happily ever after\\" but in a real world sense of making some good things come out of a senseless morass. <BR>Although this is an account of a woman's life that is true as she sees it, most of the time the read is as compelling as a well constructed suspense novel. Even those who avoid holocaust literature as too depressing can find this absorbing.

0375507507|4.0|I've had the pleasure of reading many of Bo's editorials and love her observant, funny, true-to-life style, so, I  snatched this up as soon as I got wind of it. This memoir is richly textured with both emotional and flat impressions of life as a minority white growing up in black, poor Africa while the family tries to maintain that illusion of supremacy that all good Englishman possess. Many black readers are probably surprised to find themselves living through the eyes of a white child but it is so real that I finished feeling I'd just returned from a journey that will never leave my soul.
6300214753|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of the best movies I have ever seen-no joke. Ilove the cynical Jeanie and Charlie Sheen in the police station. And Ferris is SO funny, he is the typicla highschool trouble-making, heart-breaking guy. And I love Ben Stein as the ecomnomic teacher, this movie had great direction and appeal. I am 15 now and I saw this movie for the first time around age 10.  Every time I watch it I find something else funny to laugh about. I could watch this movie 20 time s aday and never get tired of it!
B00003ZKS1|5.0|This original release on Chrysalis in 1980 finally showed Michael as the leader of his own band. After playing with Scorpions and UFO, he was on his own. It's hard to know how long Schenker had the music worked out for all of these songs, but what is amazing is how well Gary Barden(Vocals) did with writing the lyrics for most of the songs. The rest of the band was rounded out with excellent session players; Mo Foster(Bass), Simon Phillips(Drums), and Don Airey(Keyboards). The production on the recording was Roger Glover and he worked well with this group of musicians.<br />Michael's guitar work is sharp, especially on the two instrumentals \\"Bijou Pleasurette\\" and \\"Into the Arena\\". As always, he plays a multitude of astouding chords and showcases some extremely sharp solos. Barden, for being new to the music arena, does extremely well in the studio. The rest of the band is prime, as most of you who recognize Airey and Phillips know already. Phillips' performance here is as good as on the SIN AFTER SIN album by Judas Priest.<br />As far as the songs go, there are no songs to weed out to find the good stuff. This release was and remains a breath of fresh air from an old friend, who just wasn't that old at the time. Extremely powerful tracks, both music and lyrics, include \\"Lost Horizons\\", \\"Feels Like A Good Thing\\", \\"Cry For the Nations\\", and \\"Victim of Illusion\\". The other tracks, although not as flashy as the afore mentioned songs are still well better than most releases; they are just overshadowed by the songs that are much better. If you like great guitar, seasoned musicians, and fresh lyrics, you should enjoy this disc from begining to end, as the variety of music is truely worthy to eartime.

B00005YTFG|1.0|We rented it, thank God.  Baz Luhrman has the Midas touch in reverse (if you can imagine what I mean).  What a waste of young, lovely talent (Nicole Kidman) and the gifted Ewan McGregor.  A fertile topic, Moulin Rouge and the delicious city of Paris that was wasted by Luhrman.  His is a name we will avoid in the future.  But why write more?  ...
B000002OX5|5.0|Being a 16 year old female, lets just say that The Who Sells Out was not marketed for my demographic. I became addicted to the mainstream Who stuff because of Classic Rock radio, and after a while I decided to venture forth into the unknown and frightening realm that consists of each famous artist's most obscure and unusual recordings. From the opening strains of Armenia City in the Sky, I was hooked. This album contains some of the most unique and totally irreverent songs that I have ever heard. I can only liken it to The White Album. It is diverse and always surprising. It is also delightfully funny, from the album cover to the mock-jingle lyrics. I listen to it all the time, and it never gets stale. Although it's old, The Who Sells Out is never gonna die.
B000002JS0|5.0|AC/DC (Angus Young- Lead Guitar, Malcolm Young- Guitar, Bon Scott- Lead Singer, Phil Rudd- Drums and Mark Evans- Bass).  I am referring to (obviously) to AC/DC before the tragic death of Bon Scott.  This is AC/DC's first release and they come shooting with both barrels right out of the gate.  From the opening song  \\"It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll). to the final song \\"High Voltage\\"  has great classic songs that really stand the test of time.  This cd had possible the best singer in the history of rock save John \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne which no one could touch his style of singing.  Scott had a specific way of relating the topic without making it seem boring.  Enough of this junk about writing about a good cd, go out and buy it and you will not be dissapointed.
B000002UAO|5.0|By the time of Rubber Soul the Beatles were already the biggest and greatest band in the world, but they hadn't really done anything to change rock and roll. They were merely a youthful voice that brought it into the '60s.<br />On Rubber Soul the Beatles became true artists, taking the folk rock of Bob Dylan and the Byrds and making it their own. Everything about them seems to be more mature. When you listen to the lyrics of Rubber Soul you feel that you're listening to their personalities unfold before you, most notably on John Lennon's compositions, which are some of the greatest and most reflective songs of his career. Nowhere Man, Norwiegan Wood, Girl, In My Life. You know from these songs alone these aren't the same Beatles. And lets not forget George Harrison, who wrote his first great song in If I Needed Someone (not to mention that beautiful guitar line to open it. Very Byrdish). Then there is of course Sir Paul, who delivers on songs such as Michelle, Drive My Car, and I'm Looking Through You. Even Ringo has to get into the act, with an excellent vocal on his first songwriting credit, What Goes On, which is a far cry from his typical songs. (Lighthearted feelgood songs such as I Wanna Be Your Man and Matchbox) The musicianship is certainly as tight as ever, and certainly more melodic than ever before. If this were released in the '70s, when the sensitive singer-songwriter genre was at its peak, this would have been one of the biggest albums of the decade.<br />In conclusion Rubber Soul captures the Beatles at their deepest and most reflective lyrically yet without losing any of their youthful charm. This was the first time people thought of music in the context of albums, and such a belief would only continue to grow as the Beatles led an artistic revolution that would leave rock and roll changed forever. That makes this a benchmark in music history, and because of this I order YOU to buy this album right NOW!
B00000K31Q|4.0|I sulked all the way to the movie theater when I had to take my little sister to this film, only to discover that teen movies can actually be a lot of fun! There is nothing typical about this teen movie: no typical teen movie acting, no typical teen movie storyline or events, no typical teen movie events. The events are various and yet cleverly connected to make up a hilarious and moving story. The events were, to a great extent, a reflection on everyone's typical highschool experience: the girl that nobody could get, the mean jocks, the geeks, and add to that the not so typical groups such as Bob Marley wanna-bes, future MBA's (aka sophisticated geeks) and so on. Another really brilliant aspect of this film is that you cant help remember highschool and reflect on who you really were and the decisions that one made at the time.
B000002OZY|5.0|Yep, that's from &quot;Almost Famous,&quot; but this album came out way before that film did.  The Who's &quot;Tommy&quot; is one of the best rock albums that you can buy, even today (especially today).  It starts to really get good as you get into track 4, 5, and 6.  Songs like &quot;Sparks,&quot; &quot;Amazing Journey,&quot; and &quot;The Acid Queen&quot; are pure rock classics, and songs like &quot;Welcome,&quot; &quot;1921,&quot; and &quot;Sally Simpson&quot; are just good songs to listen to (rather than jump around the room to).  Overall, Tommy is probably my favorite album of 1969, although Abbey Road by the Beatles is pretty close!
B00005QDW5|5.0|Although this reviewer is a new Pink Floyd fan, I am kicking myself for not getting into this music earlier.  The reason that I bought this cd was for Another Brick In The Wall (Part II).  After listening to some other tracks, I was hooked.  On Disc 1 the good songs that are really worth lisening to are:  1.  See Emily Play.  2.  The Happiest Days Of Our Lives.  3:  Another Brick In The Wall (Pt. II).  5.  Hey You.  6. Marooned.  7.  Money.  The great songs on the second cd are:  1.  Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-7).  2.  Time.  3.  Comfortably Numb.  4.  Us and Them.  5.  Wish You Were Here.  The other songs are great but those in my mind stand out to be the choice songs on the cd.  Like I said before, I was not really a fan before I bought this cd.  Oh sure, I had The Dark Side Of The Moon and thought that that cd was their only good cd with their only good songs.  Boy was I sure wrong.  If you do not have this cd now, I suggest you go out and buy it.  If you feel like you can't buy it because you are too young for groups that were around in the 1960's then you have no clue in the fact that both the type of music came from this style and that quite possibly the artists that you like also listen to this group.  That is how I get into music that is before the 1980's.  Find out what my favorite artists listen to and then try to find a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; cd.  Enough of that rambling, go out and buy it if you do not have it.
6305047529|5.0|If you ever need movies to be cheered up run out and add The Secret Life and Wonder Man to your collection.  He had a rare and wonderful comedic talent which hasnt been matched since.  His timing was excellent and so are these two movies.
B00000K0DT|5.0|This film is definitely THE best of its kind. Not only because it is a film with a unique story line, brilliant performances, great actors and super suspense, but because it is simply one of a kind! You would have to see the film to completely understand what I mean, but trust me, you absolutely have got to buy this film. The story is sort of difficult to put together and sort of confusing initially, but that is all part of the plan of a devilishly clever storyteller who's going to really, really knock your socks off in right time!! A must-have!
B00005ATQI|5.0|This movie starts out slow and progressively gets scarier and scarier. Thats what I liked, some people may want more speed, but I find that it makes it more scary slowly building up to the ultimately freaky frightful ending. I say freaky because Kubrick makes this film weird and strange. There is one shot of two people in the hotel room, obviously ghosts, and one is dressed up like a mouse or some other strange kind of animal. It just has a strange twist to the normal scare tactics. The movie has alot of beauty to it. The blood scene coming out of the doors and flooding the room is of course horror, but it also has an artsy touch to it. I recently watched it with some kids and they were very bored at first, not enough action for them, but if I kept them focused on it, telling them things about it, kept refocusing them on it, they got really scared. They wanted me to turn it off after the old lady in the bathtub. I just love the acting. The little boys withdrawn nature and how he talked for Tony. Shelly Duvall and her naive, passive nature. Also some of the looks she gives when all the scary stuff is happening are priceless. Jack is great as head of the family turns demonic, but always with a comic edge. The movie takes that bizarre turn and mixes some real scary stuff and pairs it with strange scenes or as I said there was a sort of comedy attached to the way Jack was acting, even though it was awful, which I think made it even more the scarier. Like a man just really going through a mental breakdown. Overall, one of my favorite scary movies! A definate go see, if you don't have to be scared right away, and can allow the movie just to flow. <br />Lisa Nary
B00005JKHP|3.0|Not bad. I was really hoping to see the entire spock walk scene where they enter the enter V-ger. The memory wall scene, beacause I enjoy looking at the visual the vast designs and so on. Very interesting. The bones dialogue sequence to kirk about the mission was very BAD. They cut up the jerry goldmith music quite a bit. I liked the long journey sequence. I still find myself falling asleep but it's like a long winding trip when you wake up to discover the alien presence onboard. The sounds were fine from the original as well as the computer voice. I can see why they left out the computer voice. They changed too much though. The Vger attacking earth sequence was pretty bad I thought. I think I'll stick to the original VHS widescreen format. If you enjoyed the new star wars perhaps or babylon V effects then you will like this DVD. I am not to thrilled about it, I like the added features TV SPOTS and Teaser Trailers. That was Cool!
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game... perhaps one of the best science fiction novels written in our time. <BR>   This is a story of a young boy who is pushed to and beyond his limits in order to save Earth. Ender has an older brother, Peter, who hates Ender for his existence. Ender was born because Peter wasn't good enough. His older sister, Valentine, loves Ender with all her heart and is very protective of him. When Ender is only six years old, he is taken from his family and sent to battle school. Battle school is a school in space that finds naturally brilliant children and teaches them to become military geniuses. Here, Ender is forced to play 'the games,' and wins all of them. To him, losing is the worse thing that could every happen. <BR>   Orson Scott Card's characters show so much character development throughout this story it's amazing. Orson Scott Card is a fantastic author, and if you enjoyed this book, I recommend Ender's Shadow to you!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Every once in a while, you see a film that actually gives you something to really think about long after you leave the movie theater. Brad Pitt's and Edward Norton's superb performance will captivate you through this unabashedly anti-establishment movie all the way through. The pace of the movie can seem somewhat slow at times, but that is only because the director is probably preparing for something really special. The graphics and the music/sound effects add to the ambience that one can only expect from a movie this unique. And add to that a script where the writer is willing to challenge just about everything we take from granted in our urban societies, and you've got something that will keep your mind twisting for a long time after you see this film. And if you thought that was all, check this out: the film has a storyline with completely unexpected events that just keep getting more shocking towards the end of the film. Among the many things this film will give you to think about is what kind of minds came together to produce this absolutely twisted and yet remarkable piece of work. The verdict: GO GET IT!!
B00005OM4N|3.0|This cd is not as catchy as her first two cds, but it's not that bad. Anticipating and That's Where You Take Me are great, and I'm a Slave for U grows on the listener.  So many people attack her, but how is she any different than Janet (who has about as good as a voice), Mariah (who has implants as well), Madonna (who started out as a dance poppet), or any other number of popular pop singers.  She's not all bad.  She just needs new producers and to stay away from the hip-hop attempts and focus more on the pure pop bliss of her earlier work.
B000002I77|5.0|I really don't like the word fusion, because people think it means different things.   might not call this album fusion at all, it's more like straight funk.  It's like anything else Billy Cobham has done solo, maybe a little more intricate.  Instead of the late 70s solofest jams and the post-80s horn funk, Billy has created an actual band for this record, with some of the best interplay I've heard.<br />It's got the wonderful Jan Hammer on keys, a fusion regular who adds to every album he graces.  The first song starts with a Hammer solo you've got to hear.  For the most part the bass takes a back seat, with no solos but great lines, and Ron Carter even plays acoustic on a few tracks.  The album also has very few horns, a great trumpet feature here and there, but mostly the album focuses on the guitar/keys/drums.  Of course Billy takes many of his usual snare-drenched solos, but he keeps them mostly between the songs as intros so as not to disrupt the very catchy grooves going on.  Still, even under the solos and melodies he's going crazy as only a few can without losing control of the tight band.<br />Tommy Bolin, a guitar player that unfortunately few have heard of, is the star of this album.  He had been on the rock circuit with Deep Purple and other bands, but on this album he is as good as anyone else I've heard, and definitely the best choice for this album.  John McLaughlin is a ownderful guitar player in the straight fusion sense, and his technical skill is unprecedented, but on an album as funky as this, a rock/blues player is a better choice (Not that John can't play rock, but you know what I mean).  My favorite song is Taurian Matador, which is simply Jan and Tommy trading 4s over a sweet beat.<br />This album isn't as out-there or straight-8 as Mahavishnu albums, but it is really funky, every groove is perfect, my only complaint is that it's not longer.
0792839625|1.0|A Chorus Line is one of the greatest musicals ever written and this movie is trash.  Alyson Reed, who played Cassie, was just hideous.  Completely wrong for the role.  They took the greatest song written for a musical in the modern era, \\"What I Did For Love\\" and just massacred it.  The meaning is completely different as it is presented in the movie and it makes little sense.  Two good things about this film are Vicki Frederick (Sheila) and Audrey Landers (Val).  Both very funny ladies.  Frederick was perfect for her role as the aging chorus dancer.  This is one of those films that is just so bad that it stays in your mind because it was bad.  I saw it when it first came out and recently watched it again to see if I still hated it.  I did.  I threw my copy away.  I urge you to not buy this video.  Please don't waste your money.  If your money is burning a hole in your pocket, please donate what you would have spent on this video to your favorite charity instead.  You'll do the world some good and you won't be wasting your time.  A bit of trivia:  The actor who played Greg was later a contestant on Wheel of Fortune, so you see where his career went.
B00004VXF2|5.0|The rejection of politics, of human society, of the air, the earth, the sky, the land, the scream of the wind down by the ocean, the ultimate anthem of Pisces, a menagerie of hatred in discordant sonnet, a stab in the eye, rejection of success, rejection of art, rejection of music, a howl of the soul, a song of boredom, a punk act of defiance, a need to express disgust, visions of alien worlds, the pursuit of zen, the fever of mad genius, a stylistic statement against all thought, a reign of fire across the audience, a rejection of the role of entertainer, the rejection of stardom, Lou's self crucification - yet still easier listening than &quot;take no prisoners&quot;... hell if people can listen to whale song CDs for hours at a time why not artificial whale song? We synthesise everything else... Two function here, aid to the mind in tuning cosmically, allign with imagination centers to create art through artistic act of anti-art that becomes art, second function is to help me get to sleep at night when theres too much noise outside my room...
B000002SE0|5.0|This features an extraordinary recording of Turandot...one of the best available.<br />All the interpreters are at their prime.<BR>Scotto is a very fragile Liu singing beautifully and emotionally.<br />Corelli is outstanding!! This is surely one of his best recordings. <br />Nillson will always remain the Turandot of reference. She is really a princess of Ice at 1st and then melts in the last scene...amazing!!<br />About the EMI release...I was extremely disappointed. Be sure to own your libretto before buying this CD otherwise you will only get an italian libretto with no translations. However, each act is divided into so many tracks so that you can choose any part of the recording...for everybody's conveniance.<br />Overall...despite libretto problems...This recording Is A MUST...and not only to Nillson and Corelli's fans.
0060922583|5.0|An excellent work! <BR>I thoroughly enjoyed this read.  I liked the in-depth research and scientific bridge to what seams to be a very flexible and dynamic subject matter - ENERGY -  in it's many forms from concrete physical matter to the and subtle forms produced and experienced by psychic phenomena.   Some hard-core scientists might disregard the evidence of experiments shown in this book only because it ALSO includes personal experiences and popular stories (experienced by many!), but not me.  Where would we be with out the great scientists of the past willing to debunk \\"comfort zone\\" theories and tunnel vision.  Do people really think that our tendency towards rigid theory-frameworks of reality is that much less then 1000 years ago?  I don't think so!   Its books like this that need to be more widely read and digested for the empirical evidence they contain.  Let's not ignore this stuff anymore, everyone! The earth STILL isn't flat!!!
B00005RFQ5|4.0|get this album. It's another genre covered by his musical genius. Expect to hear a contemporary jazz album with splashes of rock and some snips of opera. It's cool. It's different. Expect that and you won't be disappointed.
0823003035|4.0|The graphic examples offered in this book are beautifully rendered.  The attention to the flow of movement, rather than angular lines, produced dimensional and life-like drawings.  The style of writing within the text was a bit etheral at times but never to where it got so far off the mark so as not to be instructive.  I most appreciated the emphasis to how light and the absence of light creates form.  It was a worthwhile purchase, although I cannot say that I came away with any new approaches to the art of figure drawing.  Perhaps that is due to the fact that there are just so many ways of inventing the wheel.
B00005QDW1|5.0|When I turned on MTV, there was Gwen singing Let Me Blow Ya Mind, and I thought, she is such a great singer! I hadn't heard anything of No Doubt until her suet with Eve, then when they released Hey Baby, I was like, where the hell have you been all this time! But now I got two of their albums, and I have to say, these guys rock! Hey Baby has probably got to be their best single yet, and this album, probably their best too, next to Tragic Paradise. If you're into music from Sum 41, Blink 182 or AAF, then you'll probably love No Doubt too, Gwen ahs an amazing voice, she could probably perform any kind of song with it, from Pop to RnB.<BR>And can some1 plz tell me, is it true that they're splitting!?!?!<BR>Well, c ya l8rz, luv ya No Doubt!<BR>Kirsty xxx
B00003CXRM|5.0|Now when I first saw this movie I thought is was going to really boring, but I have to admitt that I found this movie to be one of the funniest that I have ever seen.  If you are thinking of buying this movie then good for you.  It is well worth the money.
0385335482|5.0|I loved this book. I work at a rental counter in a small airport, and we do a lot of reading in our spare time. We have all read this book and absolutely adore it. British humor is rediculously silly, and the entire book will make you laugh and feel embarassed as Becky tangles herself into crazy and absurd lies.
B00004T8RK|3.0|Actually I haven't even bothered to buy it yet.  I've just been listening to my sister's tape copy.  But this is my call on it.<br />It's no suprise that this album had gotten bad reviews.  Commercially, it could be nothing but a flop.  There is nothing here that would sound good on the radio or MTV.<br />On the other hand, the album by itself isn't terrible if you listen to it just as an album.  It seldom resembles anything from PJ's great commercial triumphs \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\" but one thing that did come back strong in this album is the Mike Mcready guitar solos that made the band so famous, and that have been missing from most of PJ's post-Vitalogy material.<br />Speaking of Vitalogy, Binaural really is their best album since.  No Code sounded unfinished...  If my copy of No Code wasn't free, it wouldn't have been worth it.  Yield had its moments, but also had lots of clutter.  \\"Like Pilate I have a dog?\\"   Sure, Right, (duh).<br />But Binaural doesn't have those problems.  The songs are well rounded, and there's a lot less filler.  Still, don't even think of buying it if you haven't heard it.<br />Best songs--Nothing As it Seems, Light Years, Sleight of Hand,  Rival, Breakerfall, Soon Forget, Insignificance, Of the Girl, Thin Air, Parting Ways, Evacuation,  (ok, this is a tough album to pick highlights from).
B00005UEAR|5.0|Seems to me some reviewers are as long winded and convoluted as Dream Theater music. Come on Guys!! <br />This music IS DT. No more needs to be said. Buy this CD. It's good S--T, for 18 bucks!!
0385484518|5.0|I'm not one to normally read the books that everyone else is reading, but I did break down to read Mitch Albom's story of his final class with his former college professor Morrie Schwartz.<br />Albom is an excellent writer.  He draws the reader in quickly and tells a wonderful tale.  I was able to finish the book in a single evening.<br />The story, as most know, follows self-absorbed Albom as he spends Tuesdays with his dying professor.  In the process, Albom learns a thing or two about death, and about life.  The consummate journalist, he brings Morrie questions about death, marriage, family, forgiveness, regret, and culture.<br />The books is a beautiful study in dying and should be required reading for sociology courses.  Not only did the book help me think about my priorities, but it was also entertaining, providing several out-loud laughs, and moments of tears.<br />While it's a bit shallow on the spiritual side of things, I still highly recommend it.
6305508550|5.0|This was an unexpected hit in my household!  <br />Disclaimer:  This movie is NOT for everyone.  There is a certain level of crude humor, sarcasm, negativity, and irreverence about the whole thing, but if you can relate to the subject matter, that is precisely what makes it a GEM.<br />Having worked for the real-life equivalent of this movie's evil corporate conglomerate, I was able to relate to this movie in a particularly strong way, which made it a much-needed outlet for me.  From the humorous depictions of corporate \\"motivation\\" attempts, to the \\"evil boss\\" who tortures the main characters (even in their dreams), to the sudden lay-offs that send them over the edge, this movie is tailor-made for the white collar working stiffs who live it every day (especially anyone in a technical/computer/programming field).<br />If you have experienced the forest of gray cubicle walls, the droning, boring corporate meetings, the logic-lacking company policies, the inhuman treatment from management, you will LOVE this movie.  It will serve as an anchor for you to see that you aren't the only one who sees the BS for what it is, and I must say it is a refreshing feeling!  <br />If you fit the profile, the smallest detail of this movie will cause you to burst into tear-producing laughter.  If not, you might want to give it a try, but proceed with caution. :)
B000059HCN|5.0|Addiction has become an overused metaphor.  However, here the title aptly names the work.  The point is not to assume that this is just a story about four sympathetic characters succumbing to drugs.  Rather, it is also about the American Dream and the arrogant practice of management with its shallow focus on getting the task done effectively without regard to those affected whether we are speaking about a doctor prescribing pills to achieve weight loss, a couple selling drugs to start a dress shop, or a television host promising an end to loneliness by an invitation to a game show.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie is not your typical teen chick flick of a movie. There is definatley something about it that makes it much better than all the rest. I am a 14 year old guy and I love this movie more than anything. All the characters potrayed their roles perfectley. But Julia Stiles is definatley the winner. Her attitude is so real. The best scene is in the begining when she comes to school in her car with Joan Jett's Bad Reputation song blaring. Don't rent this movie...BUY IT!!!!!!
B00004ZD69|5.0|For anyone looking for a cd with, yes, emotion and, yes good melodies, listen to godspeed.  To say this is a boring cd, is ridiculous.  You can't just &quot;sit down&quot; and listen to godspeed's music, you have to hear it and apply it to whatever is going on.  I about gagged when I read one reviewer inform us to RUN and buy Creed's Human Clay.  That is disgusting.  The crescendos on this album are excellent, that is the essence of the music.  Every note and beat and crescendo has a purpose on this album.  Don't start with Mogwai or anything else, start with this cd right here.  Buy this cd.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Perhaps it was the music gods calling to me.  &quot;Buy this album,&quot; they whispered.  &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was playing in every music store I went into.  They were right.<br />'Morning View' is very different from 'Make Yourself', and this is a *good* thing.  An artist must nurture and develop his craft, and all of the guys in Incubus have done this and cultivated a knockout album.<br />&quot;Nice to Know You&quot;, &quot;Circles&quot;, &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever&quot;, and &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot; have roots in 'Make Yourself'.  They are solid rock songs with that familiar Incubus twist of excellent lyrics (though not as good as 'M.Y.') and memorable riffs.  <br />&quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Just a Phase&quot;, &quot;11 am&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, and &quot;Are You In?&quot; represent the softer, more mellow side of the band.  These are all excellent songs in their own right:  they may be slower of tempo or softer of edge, but they still have that great Incubus spirit.  These prove that Incubus are different from their &quot;genre&quot; and &quot;brethren&quot;--they aren't afraid to mature and let their sound mature as well.<br />&quot;Warning&quot; and &quot;Aqueous Tranmission&quot; stand by themselves.  &quot;Warning&quot; is not quite in the same line of the rock songs, but it's definitely not mellow, either.  It is my favorite song because it manages to combine the two styles quite nicely.  I wouldn't be surprised if it is a single.  &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; defys all conventions.  It is the ultimite relaxer of the album, drolling along at almost 8 minutes.  The Eastern influences tie in well with the lyrics, and Brandon Boyd's voice is absolutely perfect, dripping and riding the melody with ease.  These two songs show that Incubus is not a one-trick pony.  They are willing to take risks and incorporate new influences while still keeping their basic appealing sound alive and well.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|When we first purchased the DVD of Shrek, I wondered how can this movie impress me more than the animation of Disney?  How can this movie be funny with an ogre?  Boy, was I wrong.<BR>   My whole family loves Shrek.  The kids love the characters such as the fairy tales, the ogre, the donkey, and princess Fiona.  My kids understood the movie.  They are ages 4 1/2 and 2.  The adults loved the movie because of the smart humor and innuendos that kids cannot understand yet.  The music sent us back to the 70's, 80's, and 90's.  <BR>   I have to say this is a wonderfully written movie.  The animation alone is superb.  It is more realistic than Toy Story and Monsters Inc.  <BR>   It gave me an opportunity to supplement the movie with fairy tales that were pretty lengthy.  The kids like to pick out the characters that they have read about in the books.  The movie is so rich in detail that everytime you watch you find something new.  This helps to make the movie more exciting.  <BR>    I look at it as a great adventure.  In my case, this is the only movie that my kids are not fighting or talking.  They sit there like zombies glued to the set.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Very good CD. My Favorite track is Aniron. A Knife in the Dark and Lotlorien are also very good tracks.
0790733900|5.0|What a great movie. Paul Newman shows in this film (And his earlier role in \\"The Hustler\\") why he is one of the greatest actors of all time. Surprisingly, he did not win an Academy Award for his role as Luke Johnson, a born loser who ends up on a chain gang for destroying parking meters. George Kennedy did however win an Academy Award as Dragline, who becomes a sort of mentor to Luke. Luke's problem is that he has a lot of guts, but has no brains. That's why I like the phrase I used for my title. It best shows the spirit of Luke: Keep fighting, even when you are beat.  <br />There are many other elements that make this movie great. Besides the acting, there is an authentic feel to the picture's depiction of the chain gang. We can actually feel the heat bearing down on us as the men work in the fields or tar roads (This feel can be attributed to co-author Donn Pearce, who was on a chain gang for two years). This film, however, is probably most remembered for the characters of \\"The man with no eyes\\" and the prison captain who utters the famous line \\"What we've got here is...failure to communicate\\". One of my all-time favorites, I can't recommend this enough.
B00005JKQX|3.0|I just recently saw A BEAUTIFUL MIND and I have to say that it was a good movie, but there were a lot of flaws. I am not a Russell Crowe hater, but I feel that he is a slightly overrated actor. I don't really think he deserved last year's Oscar for best actor in GLADIATOR, especially if he is being nominated for this year's best actor, too. One Oscar at at time should be enough. I think they should give this year's best actor award to either Tom Wilkinson for IN THE BEDROOM or Sean Penn for I AM SAM. But most likely though, it'll go to Russell Crowe--again. <br />In A BEAUTIFUL MIND, Russell Crowe portrays the real life person of John Nash. Nash is a genius with a troubled past, but eventually subsides it and wins the Nobel Prize. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as Nash's wife. It reminded me of GOOD WILL HUNTING, which is a much better motion picture than A BEAUTIFUL MIND. Ron Howard does an excellent directing job, but this year's Oscar for best director should go to Peter Jackson, who directed THE LORD OF THE RINGS. <br />It's not the best film of the year, and I do not totally agree with all the praised reviews from professional movie critics, but it is a good film. If you like inspirationl films based on true stories or a real person's life, then you will like A BEAUTIFUL MIND. This movie is a good one and recommended, though slightly overrated.
B000002J1Y|5.0|Yes was a great band, but on this album, they show that they're a great live band. The 2 hour live show is spectuacular. I think that Yes is a lot like Allman Brothers and Santana, where they're like a jam band. But, they combine folk, jazz, country, and blues to make something really unique. Anyway, the songs are perfect. The entire &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; album is on this. &quot;And You And I&quot; is my favorite. Rick Wakeman is a fantastic keyboard player with some amazing chops. Chris Squire is very underrated in his bass work. It's very jazzlike. And Steve Howe has some great guitar parts. Listen to the middle of &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; The most catchy riff i've heard in prog-rock. &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot; is really good. I like the vocal harmonies on that. Also, &quot;Heart Of The Sunrise&quot; has a cool chromatic jam. I just wish the audience was more lively. Oh well. This is a great album and it should be added to your collection.
B00005RDAF|4.0|BRITNEY - THE VIDEOS, is not what you'd think it was. I recently purchased this DVD because I'm a big fan of Britney Spears but I have to say that even I was slightly disappointed. There wasn't too much added to it and it was really short...about 90 minutes or so. The DVD only featured three of her music videos--\\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" (from her OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN album), \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", and \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" (both from her new BRITNEY album). This DVD also includes an exclusive performance of her new song, \\"Overprotected\\", with scenes from her new full-length feature movie, CROSSROADS. The performance of \\"Overprotected\\" is great. And the three music videos are pretty good, too (though the \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" music video isn't the same one you see on MTV). Then, as little bonus extras, there are the TV commcercials she did with Pepsi and the TV commercial advertising her HBO concert show in Las Vegas. Not a spectacular DVD or one of her better DVDs, but this would make a nice, cheap little gift for any fan of Britney. If you're not a crazed Britney fan, then don't bother with this one. Instead, buy her HBO concert special in Las Vegas DVD.
B00005OAIE|5.0|When I first posted my review for John, I said he sucked and gave him a one star. I thought he was a good guitar player but his songs were boring and lyrics were stupid. Well I really wanted to get into this guy since he was really good. So I bought Grand Theft Auto 3 and said everytime i play this game Ill listen to John and see then what I thought. I did a complete 180 change of heart on this cd, I actually listen to the songs more closely and heard more of what John was playin on his 6. This cd grows on ya, at first your thinkin what the heck is this guying soundin like Dave, but it really gets to ya. After songs such as No Such Thing, Stupid Mouth, Neon, Body Is Wonderland, Love Song For No One, 3x5, i said hey this guy is alright. I went to johnmayersource.com and downloaded a whole show from Iowa. WOW! This guy is freakin awesome live, he is just awesome with his guitar pulling out solos for who knows how long, pulling off such a sweet and beautiful version of Jimi Hendrix's \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\", with several different outros. I love the outro and intro's where he mixes deleted verses and covers into his songs. He gives it all he's got and he's sorta funny up on stage too. I advice any Dave fans or Howie Day fans to pick this cd up, if not. Then download the show from Iowa off the internet and get amazed. Sure his lyrics still in my opinion suck but his songs are catchy and are extremely well play.
B00005TT77|5.0|I have yet to see the movie, but I'm in love with the soundtrack!  Even if I were not a Beatles fan (which I am), I would still love this cd.  The artists do a fantastic job taking these classics and lending them a personalized style and sound.  I love it!!
B000002WYT|4.0|Crash is a very exceptional piece of work by the Dave Matthews Band. This cd's song were made to be jammed with Live. It has its ups and downs though, but not to much downs. Ups= nearly the whole cd. Tracks like Lie In Our Graves, Two Step, Proudest Monkey, Drive In, Drive Out, and #41 scream &quot;extended jam&quot;, they are well played and well written (thought Proudest Monkey is odd its better then the lyrics to the first draft of this song entitled &quot;Route 2&quot;) Of course any POP lover bought this cd or the single because of Crash Into Me which even though everybody knows this song and they play it alot its still a good song. The Downs= the downs of the cd would have to be Cry Freedom, Say Goodbye, and Let You Down are noticable album fillers( thought Say Goodbye gets real good at the end) but they really have no attraction to em or catchy enough to be played repeatively. Overall its a preatty good cd, first time Dave Matthews fans or interested musicians should eithier be interested in this or there first record-label cd &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot;
B00005QVVB|5.0|I was lucky enough to see this classic when it first came out in 1970.  Ironically, I was stationed in Korea at the time!  It was a treat to be in the movie theater on the 8th Army base in Seoul Korea and see those opening words \\"And then, there was Korea!\\"  Predictably, the audience went wild.  I guess it's nostalgia, but I still enjoy this movie immensely.  The sharp, funny dialogue and the talented cast make this one of the best.  The TV series doesn't hold a candle to it.
6300183211|5.0|Al Pacino In A Strong Powerful performances headlines a steller<BR>cast in one of the most violent explicit langauge bloody gore<BR>gangster film of all time \\"SCARFACE\\" With a title like that you<BR>know you going to watch a corny love story filled with boring<BR>love interludes but instead you watch a cuban refugee named Tony Montanna sprung from Fidel Castro's Prisons In Cuba and Cuts himself a violent and dangerous path to become top of Miami's drug trade To be eventually brought down in a trap he made for<BR>himself. It's amazing to see Pacino's character go from being<BR>smalltime to the big time with ruthless efficenicy But it ends<BR>up in his own personal destruction when he gets hooked on cocaine<BR>and letting his newfound wealth tear everything down. Brain De Palma the master of blood and violence take the viewer on a journey through the vison of a ruthless indivudual who will<BR>stop at nothing to get what he wants. Memorable scene is of<BR>course the chainsaw cutting scene when Montanna and his friend<BR>are cornered by a trio of colombians in an aparment during a<BR>Drug/Money exchange that turns bloody. That scene was the setting<BR>of violent occurences in the entire film if you can survive seeing that bloody masscre then wacthing this film won't bother<BR>you but if you're just a tad bit squimmih i wouldn't recommend<BR>it.  But Pacino does deliver a commanding performnace with a<BR>cuban accent and a long scar on his face who can hold the viewer's attention  no matter what he does a terrfic film on<BR>all levels.
B00005OM4N|3.0|I don't understand 2 things:<BR>1. Why so many people hate her THAT much.<BR>2. Why so many peple lover her THAT much.<BR>Really, Brtiney is an average singer with a nice voice, nothing heavinly but still, and her music is simply what she likes and it's actually somewhat good, not Grammy worthy, but still. There are many out there who will automatically diss this album but i think it's an average pop album that follows the current vibe of pop music and it's o.k, not more than that. If you ask me, i'll say it's even fun to listen to sometimes!<br />All the songs here are nice, but i guess my favourits are her singles: i'm a slave for you, overprotected and the songs: Cinderella and Bombastic Love.<br />That's it. Buy this if you like the music that goes on on MTV, if you like britney or just because, but don't expect anything special.
B00005TT77|2.0|The idea of having all these great Beatles songs done by various modern artists sounds like a great idea.  Unfortunately, I got nothing out of this CD.  It wasn't like listening to something different fom the Beatles original versions, but instead they were just worse.  All in all, I just feel dissapointed.  This CD will not be in my player very often.
0375507507|5.0|Ms. Fuller raises colorfully vivid images of an Africa that, despite all it's drawbacks, she is clearly still passionate for. Her descriptive recollections are rich with sensory details that bring her experiences to life. Elements like color, sound, scent, texture, movement, feeling, thought, temperature and so on, that when entwined, allow one to live the event for themself. Basically, she makes it possible to comfortably experience her frequently inhospitable Africa. All this she achieves with a relaxed manner and with an understanding, warmth, and humor that had me thinking over and over again how cool it would be to be her friend. I highly recommend the book!
B00004Z459|5.0|...  \\"Hybrid Theory\\" is amazing. I usually don't by CD's, but this one was worth every cent. I can totally see how they managed to out-sell all of the already reputed groups [recently]. They have an outstanding sound. Granted, there are a couple of songs in the album that I don't care about, but over all, this CD is amazing.<BR>Fans of this type of music won't be disappointed! I can't wait to see/hear what Linkin Park comes out with next!<BR>They're absolutely amazing! <br />By the way, if you haven't heard these yet, I strongly suggest listening to the following:<BR>\\"In the End\\"<BR>\\"Crawling\\"<BR>\\"Runaway\\"<BR>\\"A Place for my Head\\"<br />I immensely enjoyed those songs.
B00003CX96|4.0|BREAKING AWAY is nice, sweet, film that has characters you care about, great small town locations, an involving story, and a corker of a bike race. Dennis Christopher, Dennis Quaid,Daniel Stern, and Jackie Earl Haley play locals who are outcasts in their own  home/collegetown of Bloomington, Indiana.  They are labled as \\"Cutters\\" because their fathers were stone cutters in the town quarry mines.  One of the great location shots of the film shows a wooded area years after blocks of stone have been cut out of it.  What is left is a huge swimming hole that the four hang out at, talk about life, and go swimming.  It is a great location shot that adds realism and validity to the story.  The main plot of the story is of Dennis Christopher as Dave. He is fresh out of high school,at odds with his father, unemployed, living at home and not knowing what is in store for his future.  But, he has a passion for bicycle racing (with a great \\"gift\\" of speed and endurance for the sport) and a passion for the International Italian Racing Team. His passion is so great that he even starts talking and acting Italian much to the dismay of his father brilliantly played by Paul Dooley, counteracted with the voice of reason played great by Barbara Barrie as the mother. Also, this passion gets him into a pickle when he puts on the charade to meet a college student (Robyn Douglass).  However, that all comes crashing down when the Italian team comes to Bloomington to participate in a local cross country bike race. When Dave tries to stick out his hand for friendship and friendly competition, he is savagely sabotaged by the Italian team during the race.  It is a great metaphor about life and its sometimes unsuspecting bad surprises. It is such an emotional scene of shock and dismay, the audience feels the hurt along with the character. Yet, it brings Dave out of his inability to communciate with his father that he finally has a chance to show some emotional depth for his parents.  It also brings him closer to his friends, and lets out his competetiveness to race in the Little 500 bicycle race sponsored by the College. Even if one isn't into bike racing, or even car racing, this sequence in the film keeps you at the edge of your seat and rooting for the \\"Cutters\\". It is a well filmed sequence. There are some small interesting sublots with the other three friends.  Especially Jackie Earl Haley's character as Moocher.  He has a hush, hush, but loving relationship with a girl that's explored but keeps the audience guessing even when the two go get a marriage licence. The audience is kept in the dark about the relationship. However, his friends aren't even aware of it. Overall, a great film about small town America and coming of age.  Note: Look for Hart Bochner as \\"Rod\\" in a small role as one of the campus snobs. He played the same kind of character in DIE HARD as the cocaine sniffing, businessman, jerk \\"Ellis\\".s him closer to his friends, and lets out his competetiveness to race in the Little 500 bicycle race sponsored by the College.

B00005B602|5.0|I have seen the movie twice and I adore it. And the music blend with the movie. They work magicaly together. I have noticed the music tunes during the movie and I couldn't wait to get my hands on the soundtrack, and unlike some movies when you like the on-screen music and then you get disappointed when you listen to the soundtrack, this one just kept getting better and better. <BR>Yann Tiersen did a beautiful job. A real master piece.
6305127697|5.0|I can't say enough about this amazing film, all of the actors in it were great. I have to say that Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his excellent preformance as Aaron/Roy. (Although the Academy Awards are funny like that.. Leonardo Dicaprio should have won for What's Eating Gilbert's Grape) My advice to anyone who wants to watch a great movie...buy or rent it and you will be glad you did.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Believe me, as an anti-Potter fan I went into \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" completely ready to hate it (in fact, I was even looking foward to leaving the theater and bashing it as much as possible). But I cannot do it. While it is certainly, certainly, CERTAINLY no masterpiece of cinema by any means, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" does manage to be entertaining and fun, holding a viewer's attention for its complete two-and-a-half hour run. <br />I credit the entertaining success of \\"Harry Potter...\\" to the fact that its script is very detailed, engrossing, and polished; not to mention that it gives all the fans of the books what they want by being as loyal as possible to the original text. <br />The film's entertainment also stems from the fact that the cast is a cavalcade of British actors ranging from newcomers (Daniel Radcliffe manages to give a strong performance as the title role) to seasoned actors (such as Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and Maggie Smith, who are always joys to watch and are certainly no exception here). The ensemble cast all gives performances that are very well thought out and, more importantly, it looks like everyone in the cast is having spectacular fun bringing the story and characters to life.<br />Yet \\"Harry Potter...\\" does have its weaknesses, and all these weaknesses are mainly the result of what is obviously a rushed product. It is very apparant in the special effects and some of the blocking and editing, that the film was rushed and not made to the best quality it could have been, in order to get it released during the holiday season. Because of all this, some of the scenery, costumes, and even characters look, sound, and feel phony and unbelievable: And in a movie where the enviroment and the characters that inhabit that enviroment are such an integral part of its charm, that can be a BIG problem.<br />Nevertheless, \\"Harry Potter\\" does entertain, and I cannot give it the bashing I would have hoped. If you're looking for something to fill a couple hours time or to perhaps show at a party or something of the sort, you might as well give \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" a try.
B00005KHJM|3.0|Let me begin by saying The Wicker Man is one of my favorite movies...<br />A friend gave me this DVD and I was excited to see \\"The Wicker Man Enigma,\\" the 32 minute \\"making of the movie\\" included here. HOWEVER I was blown away that the 88 minute \\"American release\\" version was featured on the rest of the DVD! Particularly after \\"The Wicker Man Enigma\\" went on about how the footage removed took so much away from the final film. I simply can't believe that no attempt was made by the producers of this DVD to use the longer version.<br />I have the 101 minute version on video and it is vastly superior. The movie makes much less sense in the 88 min copy. Chopped out bits include more background on Sergeant Howie (his fiancee, feelings about sex and deep religious convictions), how he received the letter about Rowan, not to mention other vital parts such as a scene with Lord Summerisle presenting a young man as a sexual offering to Willow and others. Also unfortunately abbreviated are many of the songs such as Willow's dance, Lord Summerisle and Miss Rose's song, etc. Some scenes are switched around to \\"make more sense\\" here, presumably after the film was butchered.<br />To anyone who has only seen the 88 minute version, I HIGHLY recommend trying to get a copy of the long version, it is like a completely different film. This is worthwhile only for \\"The Wicker Man Enigma.\\"
0425179877|4.0|I have read a number of the \\"Moon\\" books. As for the actual writing style, I put it in the \\"middle\\" category, this book is unique in its perspective, as it focusses on the MCC Mission Control Center and the flight controllers, instead of the astronauts and the moon.<br />Kranz thankfully spares us long anecdotes about his upbringing or his personal life. Whether this is to keep it personal, or because he thinks we arent' interested, I don't know, but I appreciate it. A book like this, I don't want to be bogged down in background info. <br />Kranz was one of the very first controllers, brought in under Chris Kraft from day one. He worked in the control room from Mercury, Gemini, and the Apollo program. When he tells the stories of these missions, it's not all about the astronauts, or even necessarily about the mission. It's often about the problems they encountered, and how they solved them. This perspective is unique in the \\"moon books\\". It is most interesting in the Apollo 13 crisis, but also Apollo 1, John Glenn's Mercury mission, and even \\"routine\\" missions (is sending a human hurtling into outer space ever routine?) have glitches that he explains how they solve. It's engaging reading, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br />By far the best coverage and most comprehensive analysis is of the solving of the Apollo 13 crisis. The title, Failure is Not an Option, was an apocryphal attribution to Kranz, but it is one that he still titles his book with, as it sums up his view of life in MCC. You will also get a better feel about the \\"behind the scenes\\" workings at NASA, and in the end, he gives his views how to revitalize that interest and get to Mars, and beyond.

B000001EL3|5.0|Maybe the best (or one of the best, hard to decide) Kiss album of all time!
B000050IE6|5.0|I agree with the previous reviewers. This CD is astounding.<br />I hate death metal vocals. I can't stand the grunts and growls and screams. It takes no talent to \\"sing\\" that way.<br />But I LOVE music played well, with lots of surprises, twists, turns and an eclectic array of styles. Opeth is all that and more.<br />There are so many styles of music on this CD that it's hard to categorize it. Is it progressive rock? Yes, but. Is it metal? Yes, but. Is it death metal? Yes, but. Is it folk music? Yes, but. Is it jazz? Yes, but.<br />Yes, but. That's what I have to say about Opeth's Still Life. Yes, it's all of those things...but...<br />It's not quite any of those things...at least for very long. Opeth flows smoothly from death metal growls to the most beautiful free-flowing jazz and folk (acoustic guitar) music I've heard in years.<br />Opeth is a band I wouldn't have even tried to listen to if it weren't for recommendations on Amazon.com and for personal e-mails from fellow prog rock/metal lovers...P>So impressed was I by this CD that I quickly went out and bought two more by Opeth: Morningrise and Blackwater Park.<br />Of the three, I like the vastness of Still Life better than the musical landscape painted by other two.<br />If you have the time and money, and you're not afraid to try new things, I suggest you give Opeth's Still Life a listen. It may take some getting used to. But the effort is worth it. <br />Still Life is a very cool CD.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  If you enjoy a movie that keeps you guessing, you'll love this.  It's a lot like Pulp Fiction, or Vanilla Sky in that the sense of time is off.  In fact this movie starts at the end and ends at the beginning!??  The main charecter Leonard has a disability that renders his short-term memory useless.  He can only remember about the last ten minutes, anything before that is a blank.  The movie was made so that you actually feel what it is like to be in Leonard's had.  You have no clue what happened leading up to the scene that you are currently watching.  This gives the watcher a real sense of confusion and disorientation.  Packed with twists and turns and an ending (beginning?) which leaves you utterly surprised, this movie is a must see.  You'll want to watch it all over again immediately just to see what you missed the first time.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I think the band even knows this album is bad ,case in point they were performing on Vh1 storytellers and everything was from other albums .They also performed on Abc Family and all the material was from previous albums .They have followed the rule that if your new material is weak only perform the single and songs from other albums . Rock Steady  has songs even worse than Hey Baby and that is not good . I love the band so I hope this was just a filler album to get out of the way and not an indication of what is to come in the future
B00005N9CV|5.0|This is baby making music. I usually don't get into jazz that has words but her voice is so mellow it almost blends in with the music.
079284131X|5.0|Easily the best one,it is the most original,and has more than enough jolts of horror when you're not expecting them.Also,it is the 1st film,which is mostly,in any series,the best.There is nothing bad about this movie,except the lack of SF.<BR>bottom line-BUY IT!
B000003TA4|5.0|This is the CD that changed the face of music in its time. Listening to Nirvana now, after all the alternative bands that have come after them, makes me realize how original they were. They started a new chapter in Rock and this CD definately shows it. Hits like &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and &quot;Come As You Are&quot; come across as fresh as when they first came out. A classic CD for any rock collection.
B00000JPHG|3.0|Passes the &quot;good or bad test&quot;on the plus side,but is definitely<BR>NOT a horror movie.There are several love scenes here,little horror,and not as much gore as CP 1,2,and 3.But i also think it is boring in the beginning,and it is the most PREDICTABLE movie iv'e ever seen.Without seeing it,you'd probably know the story anyway-which is not so with CP 1-3,for Child's Play as a title is not predictable.But this movie-from the instant &quot;tiff&quot;rescues chucky's battered parts,you know what'll happen.The scares here are mostly false,but is sometimes horror-like,for 2 or 3 scenes.<BR>The worst part is-this movie was made in 1998 and now it's 2002.I was expecting &quot;son of chucky&quot;In 2000 or 2001!If they don't refresh the Chucky story like done in this film,it will give all these films terrible ratings,which is not fair.I know it has been from 1992-1998 as a gap beetween CP 3 and BRIDE OF CHUCKY,but that was simply becuase of the complex layout they were probably planning.As for the &quot;Son of Chucky&quot;At the end,that should be taken out further and Refreshed-in CP 5!.I need to have a new sequel,and if the makers read other reviews ,everyone else aggress-No Sequel=Bad News.
B000006MS3|5.0|Twenty years after its original release, The Dreaming remains one of the most remarkable and innovative achievements in the history of pop music. Kate Bush has always been a very unique artist, but even compared to her other albums, this is an extremely original, sometimes even outlandish work. The mood changes constantly, ranging from the ominously bizarre to the extremely lyrical, and despite of the almost endless variations of moods and musical styles The Dreaming remains a single piece, a fabulous journey through a person's most intimate regions.<br />Kate's lyrics are always meaningful and poetic, and her voice is as entrancing as ever - she sings, soars, swoops, screams and whispers in a way that is involving and strangely devoid of artifice. This is a very challenging album, sometimes warm and lyrical, sometimes cold, harsh and dissonant. With themes like the futility of knowledge, the senseless violence of war, cultural colonialism and modern society's attitude towards nature, this is an unsettling, mature and profound work destined to become one of the most important pop albums of the 20th century.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Well to start off this is one of my favorite movies.  I think it has a amazing soundtrack.  The camera angles are one of my favorite parts of the movie. I love the split screen and when the camerea is attached to the person(i use that in some of my flicks).  It has great actors, Marlon Waynes, Jered Leto, Ellen Burstyn.  I guess some people dont think its original, but who cares its a great movie that i can safely rate the highest ive ever seen.  I even have the shirt and soundtrack.
0800179501|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie. It's really something when a movie makes people young and old discuss what they think the real meaning of wax-on wax-off means. But I won't go into details. All I have to say is Billy Zabka made the movie what it is. Sure Macchio and Morita were great but what about that blonde punk who plays Daniel's nemesis? His portrayal as the classic bully Johnny Lawrence is EXCELLENT. KK wouldn't have been nearly the same without his classic California punky attitude. Cheers to Zabka.
B00005RYQO|5.0|I absolutly loved this movie, I watched it 5 times in one day!  I just couldn't keep my eyes off the tv.  It has a great story line and cast. It also has awesome cars, motorcycles and music. <BR>Ok, so maybe one of the reasons I couldn't keep my eyes off the movie was because of PAUL WALKER.  But this movie is a great and it's also the safest way to enjoy drag racing.  But not only did I love it but my Dad, at 47, did as well (good for all mature ages).  He remembered drag racing when he was younger, but in his words &quot;with out all the goodies&quot;.  Enjoy the ride!!
6305364648|5.0|True Lies is one of the best action movies of our time. The plot is Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator Movies) is in the FBI but his family doesn't know. Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) and Tom Arnold (The Stupids). It's one of my favorite movies and it should be one of yours. It also had some of the best special effects, which is remarkable considering that it was released in 1994 befor special effects became noticeably better. Bye.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This film, in my opinion, is the best Disney film ever made.  The animation, the story and the delightful songs make it an absolute treat for anyone of any age.  Now, Disney releases an IMAX version and it is even more stunning.  The story of Belle, the independent, book-loving young woman stuck in a town that doesn't appreciate her, is as entertaining today as it was when it was released over a decade ago. Besides Belle, there is a host of other entertaining characters such as Lumiere, the candelabra, Ms. Potts, the teapot and of course, Chip, the precosious tea cup.   The added scene, \\"Human Again\\", is a nice addition and seeing all the vibrant colors and incredible animation on the IMAX screen is a movie lover's dream.  I'm hoping Disney will soon release this Oscar nominated film (the first animated film to be nominated for \\"Best Picture\\") on dvd.  It is one of those beautiful movies that is perfect for the dvd format.  For now, however, I'll just enjoy it on IMAX.  Don't miss it on this screen, its worth your time and money
B000002ITW|4.0|I'm not saying it's not a great record, only it sounds a bit old nowadays, especially if you listen to the electric part. Neil is just great, and so are some songs from D. Crosby, but the whole record sounds really old, and is mainly for fans (like all live albums, anyway). For somebody who does not know CSNY I would suggest to start with Deja Vu, but if you like live albums and you want to enter a totally different age (some calls for peace and love sound sooooo old!)it's just great. + there are some songs which are just too good, like Ohio, Cowgirl in the Sand,The Lee Shore, Chicago, Find the Cost of Freedom. So buy it, but be prepared to some lengthy guitar solos which nowadays sound strange, and some melodic jewels which still sound great.
0062502182|2.0|This cloying little fable (actually, isn't it too long to be a fable?) can perhaps best be summarized with those famous words from the immortal Casey Kasem: \\"Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars!\\" Through the quest of the Andalusian shepherd boy Santiago, the author exhorts the reader to pursue their own \\"personal legend,\\" the ultimate message being that failure to achieve that either means you're not devoting your heart to that goal, or you've misinterpreted what your personal legend is. If this sounds a lot like self-help guru hucksterism, a la Tony Robbins, et al, it's because that's more or less what it is, dressed up as charming literature. Of course, it doesn't address what happens if two people's personal legends happen to conflict-in the New Age world this fable inhabits, presumably some benevolent force is making sure this doesn't happen. In any event, Santiago's personal legend, as revealed in a dream, concerns buried treasure in Egypt. Along the way he meets all manner of folks who dollop out the wisdom as only is possible in fables. While it's kind of hard to trash stories that suggest one follow their heart, this doesn't offer any new or particularly skillful spin on the theme. Neither as hilariously dated as Jonathan Livingston Seagull, nor as charming as Le Petit Prince, it's slickly written eminently skipable.
B00005UEAR|5.0|In 1993 I had the joy of making an accidental discovery. Within it, I found just how wonderful serendipity can be. That discovery was a group from New York. A group called Dream Theater. From the intense chorus of &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; all the way to their newest work, I have found myself rife with both admiration and gratitude. In admiration of the sheer talent, authenticity and technical merits of this collection of musicians. My gratitude comes from the sheer yet simple joy that I receieve each and every time I listen to their music. They have an innate ability of raising the bar in both their creativity and virtuosity. Quite simply, they are not a band to be challenged. Nor can they be.... Their lyrical depth and musical height are without peer, and that has never been more evident than in &quot;Six Degrees&quot;. It is not often that you can find a group so indulgent, yet so brilliantly musical at the same time. A beautiful fusion indeed.<br />As with &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot;, the material once again displays the gifts that this group has. Both in their creativity and execution. They capture a sound that is more brash and certainly more bold than any of their past releases. Even more than &quot;Awake&quot;. John Petrucci's use of a seven-string electric is evident, but like any master, his use of it is both brilliant and effective. To put it simply, there are no weak performances within this collection. James LaBrie is dynamic as always, and John Myung is'nt in the shadows as much as on past releases. My only complaint of past DT releases was the fact that John Myung was a &quot;forgotten man&quot;. He has more freedom on this album, and certainly makes the best of it. Way to go John! The performances by Mike Portnoy and Jordan Ruddess are, well, typical. Typical of the brilliance and mastery that we have been treated to in the past. Both display tremendous skill and facility, and within the hemisphere of their playing, both earn the respect of being called Mr. or Master.<br />Dream Theater is not a band for those who enjoy the bleak and antiquated world of minimalism. Their craft is like that of a beautifully crafted artform. Rare in its character and invaluable in its meaning. The kind of work that you would place upon your highest shelf. A lofty place for only the most deserved of musicians and performers. If you are of the mentality that &quot;less is more&quot;, than you need not enter the valhalla that is Dream Theater. It is a pantheon within itself. Where music is king and the power of the imagination is no &quot;Dream&quot;.....g called Mr. or Master.<br />Dream Theater is not a band for those who enjoy the bleak and antiquated world of minimalism.

B000059MEK|5.0|While on the editor's review, comments are made on how Daft Punk copies the sounds of others, I think it must be said that they have a noise all of their own. I reccomend this record for anyone who likes to just let loose and dance, hum, anything, but if you like to &quot;feel&quot; the music you listen to, this is the one for you!
B000002NG7|5.0|Faith No More was one of those bands who had 15 minutes of fame at one time and then faded away, but kept making great music and didn't compromise for anyone.  Ask anyone if they ever heard of Faith No More and they'll either say they don't know who they are or \\"aren't they the band that did that Epic song?\\"  ...Anyways, \\"Album of the Year\\" was possibly Faith No More's finest album, and thats saying a lot being the fourth of four fantastic albums in a row.  Before rap-metal ruled the airwaves there were bands who were doing it before and doing it a lot better that didn't get the recognition they deserve like Faith No More and Biohazard.  I strongly recommend checking this out, you'll dig it, guaranteed.
B000005DQR|5.0|I was recommended this by a colleague that I worked with in Holland in '97 having chatted about various types of music that we liked. For me the whole album is brilliant but the tune that really gets me going is &quot;What does your soul look like&quot;. He's remade it on preemptive strike but it doesn't match this killer. I was truly amazed by the depth and scope of what was being done and I remember discussing this album with another colleague in the UK in '99 and we were both agreed that it was ahead of it's time. Well I missed DJ Cam's '96 trailblazer which is also tops but this just does it for me.<br />Why review now? Well I've just pulled it out of the rack again and to be honest there is always sometime when I feel like playing it. Whenever I am on my travels around Europe and that is often this is one of the first CD's to be packed. If you have heard about it and haven't got it BUY IT. If you haven't heard about it and want something to really appreciate BUY IT.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I had seen this film in the theatre and was mixed in my feelings about it.....but after repeated viewing, I really am amazed that it ever got made (or was embraced by so many people.)<br />Vacillating between serious and ludicrous (necessary to prevent the film from being overly sentimental) may be difficult to take at first but if you can relax and let it take you away you might be moved in ways you didn't think you would.<br />If you don't get swept into the emotions of these characters, you probably need to learn some empathy and thaw out your heart. Truly a magical piece of art that has the capacity to both visually entrance you and touch your heart. <br />It's a beautiful testament to the concept of loving someone \\"...come what may....until my dying day.\\"<BR>That's something that in our modern fast paced world we may need to be reminded about......
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie is great. I've seen it three times. ... This movie is fantastic! It was hilarious! I liked the part when Ron says, \\"She needs to sort out her priorities.\\" Filch, Snape, and Malfoy were all ugly, creepy, and sinister enough. It's a three-way tie when it comes to who was creepier. If I had to pick one, I would say Snape gets first, with Malfoy running a close second. If that creepy little kid was Malfoy, I shudder to think what Mr. Malfoy is going to look like in the next movie. Two words, MUST SEE! Harry and Ron were both good actors, not to mention CUTE! The part with the sweets on the train was hilarious, I just love the look on Ron's face when Harry says, \\"We'll take the lot.\\"  The real tear-jerker scene for me was when Harry was sitting on the window petting Hedwig.
B00005NOOH|5.0|If only all documentaries were of this quality!<br />If you've never seen the series before, prepare yourself for a roller-coaster ride of emotions and a visual / audio treat. If you have seen it, then buy it anyway - it can be watched over and over again it's that rich and detailed.<br />Unbiased, factual and brilliantly put together - it's a breath of fresh air when compared to Hollywoods recent historic perversions.<br />I will never, as long as I live, forget the US marines descriptions of Iwo Jima and his account of the fellow marine having a piece of his enemy land in his lap - sad, funny, awful, comical, all at the same time - like I said - stunning!
B00001QGPR|4.0|This is David Bowie's second best lp after Earthling.He's finally returned to the good old Hunky Dory days and songs like Seven,Survive and The Pretty Things are amongs his best 90's songs.If you like his early 70's stuff and a few good 80's rock stuff you should definitely check this lp.
0679731725|5.0|This novel is so heartbreakingly beautiful I get shivers even thinking about it. I loved it on so many levels: as a portrait of upper-class England between the wars, as a subtle tale of unrequited love, as an examination of regret at the end of one's life. It's absolutely a must-read.
B000001EC1|4.0|You can't go wrong with most of the hits on this \\"best of\\" CD.  If you are a rock music fan and yet can't sing along to such songs as \\"Livin' On A Prayer\\" and \\"Runaway\\", then either you don't have a pulse, Kurt Cobain or Michael Stipe is your cousin, or both.  \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\" is one of the most legendary anthemic songs of all time; I still love it to this day.  \\"Bad Medicine\\" and \\"Keep The Faith\\" are also great tunes.<br />To the downside:  \\"Always\\" is a horribly overrated, sappy ballad; \\"Prayer '94\\" is a lame remake that just pales in comparison to the original ROCKING song, and a few key tracks are missing.  Most notable, of course, is \\"Born To Be My Baby\\" and \\"Never Say Goodbye\\"; but it would have also been nice to hear a few \\"deep cuts\\" off the first two albums and perhaps a quality ballad like \\"In These Arms\\" from the later stuff.<br />All in all, however, this CD just sums up very well why bands like this were, and still ARE, so fun to listen to.  The combination of gorgeous melodies and numerous hooks make this a must-have for fans of '80s rock.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I have always been a fan of Star Trek: TMP, but it is even better in this new Director's Edition. Some of the special effects have been redone very well, seamlessly adding them in in such a way that it is hard to determine which are the new effects and which are the original.<br />The thing I like most about this film is just how beautiful it is, both the special effects and the music. Especially scenes like the first approach to the Enterprise, and flying through V'ger.<br />This movie has an interesting idea and a good plot. There is also some good characterization in this movie, although it is not as fully realized as one would hope. We get to see a little bit of the dark sides of both Kirk and especially Spock in the beginning of the film. And of course there is the great scene where we Spock weep for V'ger. The two new characters, Decker and Ilia, work well enough, but I felt that their relationship with each other, and also Decker's relationship with Kirk, should be more developed. But as it is it does a good job.<br />This new director's edition of TMP is now my favorite of all the Trek films. I highly recommend it to anyone, especially Trek fans.
0894803123|5.0|This is my favorite ice cream book.  Ben &amp; Jerry tell their story in the beginning and the basics of how ice cream is made. Then they list their &quot;11 Greatest Hits&quot; which are 11 of their best ice cream recipes.  Next there are 13 variations of chocolate ice cream and 15 fruit ice cream recipes. There are 29 &quot;Downtown Specials&quot; that include Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. The book also lists cookie, candy, brownie, sundae, sauce and drink recipes. In total, this book is 125 pages long.  I love the thick, rich ice cream that I get from every batch.  Their flavors are the best!!
B000002HMH|1.0|What happened to one of my favorite bands? The decline began with \\"the Black Album\\" and has steadily steamrolled into mediocrity. But this is just bad.  Boring tempos, boring songs, just plain boring. I nearly cried (from boredom and listening to a once great band's lifeless epitaph). An open note to James and the boys: if you would get back to writing great music like ...And Justice For All and Ride the Lightning, you wouldn't have to worry about your fans downloading the few good songs for free, they'd go buy the album. Get back to doing what you DID best, leave the brooding ballads and alt.rock to those who do  those the best.
B000059S9D|5.0|At some point in listening to this album, you have to ask yourself, &quot;Is this really progressive rock?&quot; Sure, the symphonic epic scope of the 13:03 &quot;Russia on Ice&quot; and the extensive sax/flute jams on &quot;Hatesong&quot; tell you &quot;yes.&quot; However, the euphoric acoustic pop of &quot;The Rest Will Flow&quot; and the hard-rocking chorus of the title track really make you question this album as a prog piece.<BR>     <BR>So, genre-haters rejoice at this British prog-pop hybrid that celebrates Floydian surrealism as well as Beatlesque catchy pop. True, you'll be singing many of the album's catchy, poppy melodies for months to come, but this isn't the simplistic, commercial tripe you hear on FM radio. Though poppy to a certain extent, many of these songs exhibit sophistication, subtle details and adroit playing native to progressive rock. Not to be forgotten, obviously, is the brilliant songwriting.<br />This album also has a great diversity of moods, which is something that really spices it up. &quot;Four Chords&quot; is high energy rock that criticizes commercialism in music. &quot;Last Chance to Evacuate&quot; has a nostalgic feel in the first part and a space age adventure in the second. &quot;Russia on Ice&quot; is heavily melancholic and powerful. &quot;Where Would we Be&quot; is both the simplest and most powerful track on the album, consisting mostly of just acoustic guitar and vocals. This song is incredibly moving.<br />Really, all of the tracks stand out on here. Some catchy and poppy, some conspicuous prog takes. If your up for  something adventurous that challenges your expectations, try this out. And if you know any pop fans who are sick of commercial music, point them in Porcupine Tree's direction. Chances are, they won't be disappointed. And niether will you.
B00004Z459|5.0|For those of you who have read my reviews and listmania lists, you would know me as a 'teenybopper'.  Well guess what?  I'm not--I'm a rock fan too you just don't know it yet.  This review will prove it:<br />'Papercut'-good all the way through<br />'One Step Closer'-good till the point where they scream 'Shut up' OVER and OVER again.<br />'With You'-it's good till they stretch lyrics out--it's good but a little, itsy bit annoying.  Good song, though.<br />'Points of Authority'-'you like to think you're never wrong/you live what you've learned/you have to act like you're someone/you live what you've learned/you want someone to hurt like you/you live what you've learned/you want to share what you've been through/you live what you've learned'--highlight lyrics.  All the lyrics were good but those were the highlight of the song.<br />'Crawlin'-OMG!  I HATE THIS SONG!  IT'S SO ANNOYING!  This song is known as their 'hit song' but I would call it their 'fall song'.  It's ugh...bad.<br />'Runaway'-I don't really like this song.  I usually skip it.<br />'By Myself'-I'm listening to it right now and I don't remember listening to it.  It's like it jut appeared.  Weird.  Anyway, that's what this song is, weird.<br />'In the End'-I LOVE THIS SONG!  THIS SONG IS WHAT GOT ME TO LISTEN TO THIS CD! THIS SONG AND MUSIC VIDEO ARE AWESOME!  I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I'VE OVERPLAYED THIS SONG! THE LYRICS, MUSIC, THE PERSON SINGING, EVERYTHING IS AWESOME! :)<br />'A Place For My Head'-rap and background music is good but when they sing, it's a little bad<br />'Forgotten'-wow!  First second is like BAM!  It doesn't slowly get into rock--it starts out rock!  Get ready to get bammed in the face with rock!<br />'Cure for the Itch'-this song is interesting.  Weird &amp; interesting but catchy.<br />'Pushing Me Away'-this is my second 1st favorite song (it's a tie between 'In the End' and this one).  This song is kind of spiritual to me (long story).<br />Anyway, I highly recommend this CD.  It may take a while to get used to but it ROXS!  Bye.
B00005RFQ5|1.0|Don't believe all the HYPE being done to support this album. This is by far the worse Prince has done in his career. Period. The music is weak, and the mechinical voice over throughout the album is over-bearing, confusing, and kills the effort. I don't reject any of Prince's religous beliefs, but on the other hand this is not why I or the general public buys music! In other words, I object to what Prince is trying to accomplish with this album. It's too self-absorbing, and self-rightous for my tastes. I can appreciate that Prince declares that he has found God, but what this album speaks of you can get for free--so why bother buying the cow? Borrow before you buy!

B0000013GT|5.0|Rappers take notice, Outkast is dangerous.  They are a threat to the \\"art\\" of sampling and may just hip-hop to the so called \\"intellectual listeners.\\"  ATLiens, their sophomore effort, is not as deeply sunk in melodic subtlties as Aquemini and Stankonia, but it is more consistent.  Where the latter 2 go for more progressive and complicated melodies, ATLiens takes smooth sounding basslines and adds extraterrestrial weirdness to it.  It's awesome!  The first Outkast album I've immediately loved!  If I had to name my fav tracks, \\"ET\\"(i could swear there's a Phil Collins melody that sounds just like it!), \\"Millenium\\", and \\"Wheels of Steel\\" take me to another place.  <BR>  After listening to the complexity of Stankonia and Aquemini, ATLiens pleasures me with its instant accessiblity...what it isnt is typical hip-hop!
0553213105|5.0|Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, is one of the most superb novels in English literature. This novel includes love, lies, and lively characters. Austen's style of writing is superb, her use of the English language is music with words. Austen is able to give the reader an all around view of each character, since it is written in third person omnipresent, but through the many letters, the reader is able to understand each character in a personal way.<br /> Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett is an exception to the typical women of her era. Her lively wit and determination not to marry for money is a model for women of all time, these qualities allow her to transcend time. Elizabeth stands up for herself and in the end is rewarded for her steadfast constitution, by marrying the man she loves. Although this situation is not typical in everyday life, that same quality is what makes this novel loved by all. Pride and Prejudice feeds into the illusion of true and perfect love. The man comes to rescue of the woman he loves and in doing so saves her and her family. He goes against his family's and societies wishes to marry the woman he loves.<br /> The unique way Pride and Prejudice is written enhances the story. The reader is able to get an inside look into every character's personality. The reader is able to see the flippant way Lydia writes as she decides to run away with Mr. Wickham, how truly ridiculous Mr. Collins is, and how sincerely Mrs. Gardiner loves Elizabeth. Through the letters we learn about some of the most important event in the novel. Mr. Wickham's true character, Lydia's elopement, and even Darcy's involvement in fixing the scandal.<br /> It is every woman's dream to be Elizabeth Bennet. To marry the man she loves become rich and live happily ever after. This novel plays on everybody's want to find true love despite all the obstacles in life. I loved Pride and Prejudice because it transported me to another simpler more beautiful place, where love conquers all.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This cd is one of the best there is yet.  i have heard other artists and all of that stuff, but i have never heard anyone like Nickelback.'This is how you remind me' is one of the greatest songs out yet, and the lyrics are so true...
B000024D4R|5.0|With tensions rising between Gilmour and Waters they pulled out one of the best albums ever. From start to finish this album is full of blistering guitar riffs and leads. It is a pretty straight forward but rocking album. Pigs on the Wing a simple love song written with Waters' wife in mind. Nice acoustic guitar with some Waters vocals makes you think that this is going to be a happy album. The second track Dogs begins. Again some acoustic and a little keyboards with a nice melody. Gilmour's vocals come in and the album takes a turn you can feel the negative energy in Gilmour's voice. Gilmour then delivers some of the best lead guitar ever put on vinyl. 17 minutes of whaling guitar with some venomous Waters' vocal at the end. This sets the tone for the middle part of the album. Pigs tramples all over the Government and people that stick their nose where it does not belong. At the end, Gilmour again rips the strings up with a powerful and climatic solo. Sheep takes over with a dark but humble beginning give some signals as to what lies ahead a driving thumping bass line and some of the Waters' best vocals. Noone can deliver those vocals like Rog and even Dave says so to this day. A powerful hard rocking song that sends chills down my spine. The album does end on a happy note with the conclusion of Pigs on the Wing. If you love guitar and powerful driving songs. BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00004U8H4|3.0|Following a great introduction and wonderfully controlled plot development, this movie ends with a fizzle.<br />Much like the 1980's -- the decade in which the story takes place.<br />A big &quot;thank you&quot; to the production team on this movie for not making it the bloodbath it might have been.  I was never a fan of Brett Easton Ellis but when he published the novel on which this film is based, I knew he was a rank amateur and that little more than luck had fueled his career.  His use of extreme violence was only a means to get attention for an otherwise paltry manuscript.  No -- or very minimal -- artistry involved.<br />I've heard that the director of this film wanted to rescue the story.  And she did a wonderful job.  This isn't the first time this has happened in film.  In fact, compare another very famous film -- Hitchcock's &quot;Psycho&quot; -- to the novel by Robert Bloch on which it was based and you can immediately see a parallel.  Even bad novels may contain the seed of a great idea.  And we are lucky sometimes to have movie directors capable of reworking them and creating art.<br />The actor, Christian Bale, is phenomenal in this movie.  I had never seen him before but I will be looking for him in other roles.  Here he plays the title character perfectly.  I can't think of anyone better to play Patrick Bateman.<br />The rest of the cast is excellent.  And I am once again pleased to see the beautiful Chloe Sevigny.  Unfortunately, she is not in many of the film's scenes.  But when she is, wow!  <br />So, I wish this movie had ended more satisfactorilly, but I understand what the director was trying to do.  The eighties were about style more than substance.  And while this movie has both, in the end, substance loses.
B00003CXV4|5.0|I havent seen the original, and i always like to do that first.. but..I couldnt take my eyes off this movie!!! You never knew what was going to happen next. the transformation of Keanu was so slow and subtle, it was done very well. and Theron... well, she is just Top notch actress, she says it all with her eyes. I couldnt really see them together romantically on screen, but it worked better than I imagined.<br />Its funny too. I laughed a lot. But get your tissues out, its a real tearjerker.<br />excellent movie....<br />Ive seen 1,400 (over) movies so I like to think I know what Im talking about...but who knows?<br />I plan to buy it, ...I think you find its worth it...<br />I think the guys may like it. I dont really think its a CHICK FLICK (GOSH I HATE THAT PHRASE)
B000002J0B|4.0|This album is superior to almost all of Led Zeppelin's albums, and would be if two songs were left out of it:  THE OCEAN and THE CRUNGE.  Just as most of their other albums, Houses of the Holy, features great vocals by Robert Plant (duh) and Jimmi Page (duh again), but the other instrumentation by John Paul Jones, and John Bohnam are TOTALLY under rated, listen to another LZ album and tell me that Jones doesn't totally rock!!  OCEAN AND CRUNGE are the only reason that this album doesn't make me 1 star happier.  Get this album
B00005JKT8|5.0|I loved this movie.  Leopold is so charming- and you wonder: why can't all guys be like this?  During the movie, Leopold makes you feel accepted as a woman.  He goes beyond and totally comforts you.  WIth a wonderful ending, Kate & Leopold, warms the heart, and makes women feel taken care of.  It makes women feel just wonderful.
B000002MP2|3.0|Well, they're guitar parts are very simple, stuff you can play the first day you pick up the instrument.  This can be forgiven, though, since they only have one guitar.  The bass lines are pretty cool actually.  So, in the crappy sea of most modern rock (although this is changing) Green Day stands out as a decent band.  It's surprisingly good, considering their west coast punk roots and the junk that makes up most popular music.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Why are people dissin Ms.Spears? This record is great! It's not all bubble gum pop - it's a whole buncha stuff mixed together. Personally, I think this has to be one of my favorite albums. Maybe it's just because I'm a music lover and I listen to everything, but hey, give Britney some credit. There are a lot of good dance tracks on here...a few songs with an \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" vibe, a few songs that sound like her old ones, and a few totally different ones. I mean, she even co-writes a few songs. I'm proud of the girl. This is a milestone in Britney history! I don't know WHY people are putting this album into question...I love it. Her vocals aren't as strong as they could be but the songs don't really call for high notes. Britney isn't Diana Ross...She's Britney and she does her own thing. 13 good tracks n it doesn't even cost a lot. Sound like a deal to you? Well, all I have to say is...GO OUT AND BUY THE ALBUM IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!!!!!!!
B00005Q3TZ|3.0|...  I doubt seriously that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer felt they had a legitimate Oscar contender with this film.  Not every screenplay is Braveheart.  Just ask Bryan Singer.  <br />It's just a movie.  Entertainment.  And on that merit, I found it quite enjoyable.  Never have I seen a movie portray the bombing of Pearl Harbor in this way.  And the love triangle, though admittedly cliche, did nothing but show that people did, in fact, live on the island before, during, and after the attack.<br />No, it's not Saving Private Ryan or Titanic.  It's Pearl Harbor.  It isn't great, but it isn't awful.  It's a fun night at the movies.
B000002H97|5.0|I bought this album and the first time i listened to it i was blown away! Enter Sandman was, of course, awsome because i had heard that before. And then Sad But True has an awesome gutiar part. Holier than Though was very good. The Unforgiven had sweet lyrics. And then THrough The Never, Nothing Else Matters, And of Wolf And Man were awesome. This is one of the few CD's i can listen to over and over! it deserves 10 out of 5
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice was one of the best novels that I have ever read. It was not only a touching love story, but also an accurate reflection of the Victorian society in that era.  The story evolved heavily on the complications among different classes. The pride within each character and prejudice between them further enriched the novel. Some characters, such as Darcy and Lizzie, found themselves fighting among their pride, prejudice and their affections for each other revealed an idea that true love outweighs anything and everything. Each character in the novel contrasted significantly in terms of their characteristics. We can recall these contrasts among the five Bennet sisters, Mr. and Mrs. Bennets, and Darcy and Bingley. Another interesting point revealed by Jane Austen is that characters with similar characteristic attracts. We can see this through the two loving couples, Jane and Bingley, Lizzie and Darcy.These complications and challenges that each character had to struggle within themselves made the novel Pride and Prejudice a great masterpiece.
B0000026UL|5.0|This is DYLAN at one of his best!!...Not one secondary song in the production and he even sounds great!!Everything is Broken is a...master from the genuis.and What Good Am I is another. God bless Bobby, listen and you'll hear a person who can take the frustraions of life is two lines and startle you head....My wish is he would do it again (and he most uncertainly will) and I hope he looks at producer Don Was who was able to get Waylon after years to produce a wicked sound that is his best in years......Bobby, do it all and do it your way.no one can change you anyway....this CD rates 51/2 stars.....I LOVE YA!!!!!
B00005MG2Y|5.0|To get started,Linkn Park my all-time favorite band. Last year, Febuar 2001, I bought their Hybrid Theory CD. At first I only liked 3 songs, but after a while I listened to the others and eventully liked them all. Now, A year laer, Linkin Park is my favorite band. For Christmas last year (10 months after I got my original LP CD) I had my parents order me this, just for the 2 songs. My December is mainly sung by Chester and dosen't have any drums or bass or anything. The whole song's music is made by turntables. It's not like any other songs on the album. It's very soft. I'd rate it 7/10. High Voltage is mainly a rap song, sung by Mike, as you would've guessed. I've heard many diffrent versions of this song, but this is easily the best. I'd rate it 8/10. And here's a hint:<BR>Don't have [the money] dollars to spnd on 2 songs?<BR>Then check out the import of One Step Closer!<BR>You'll be glad you did!
B00004STPT|5.0|I bought this soundtrack used and listened to it so much that it wouldn't run in my cd player anymore. I am buying a new one because it rules!  Hans Zimmers past work such as Crimson Tide is good but this is his best by far.
0800129806|4.0|I'm not much of a fan of this time frame, however, the acting and the screenplay was very well done.  When King Arthur offers to release Gweneviere from the upcoming marriage, because he fears she doesn't love him (and still offers to protect her parents village from harm, regardless of her answer)... it's quite touching, and we see through this action and others that he is a good and honorable man who loves her very much.  His vision and ruling of Camelot is portrayed with high respect and strength.<br />When Lancelot repeatedly saves Gweneviere, we see how his love for her continues to grow as well.  With two special, and so very different men in love with her, she is forced with some difficult choices and emotions... through it all, she is torn between the two, and this story is full of surprises and troubles of other kinds.
0871137380|5.0|This isn't the type of book to which I am normally attracted.  However, after hearing so much about it, I thought I'd give it a try...read a few pages and if it didn't grab me, I'd just put it down.  Well, it grabbed me and I couldn't put it down.  This is a detailed account of not only the fighting in Mogadishu in 1993, but the history and politics that led to the event.  A true story that reads like fiction.  It is a real eye-opener.  I don't think I will ever see international news reports in the same way.  There is so very much the average citizen never learns.  Thank you, Mark Bowden for bringing this story to our attenion.

6301697707|3.0|I thought this would be a cheesy low-budget, no-plot film.  Well, the plot was pretty ridiculous... but it was well thought out and described.  Our family watched this film and was pleasantly surprised.  There was a lot of action and suspense.  If you enjoyed similar type movies like THE BIRDS, PIRANHA, and other similar movies... you'll like this one even more.  This film has a great cast, and an adorable kiss scene with Kevin Bacon, that will leave you smiling.
0446677450|5.0|It is really a good book which is worth to read if you don¡¦t want to be the slave of money.<br />Go to school; get a better honor and work in a large corporate, then you can gain a better living when you grow up. This concept has been deeply implanted in my mind though my parents haven¡¦t told me for any, the media do. <br />I was firstly totally trust in this concept, however, when I grow larger and larger, I can see that not every person who have got a first honor degree can earn a high income and have a comfortable lives. They still have to work very hard day by day and worry about their jobs. And I just think this was horrible. <br />This book ¡§Rich Dad and poor dad¡¨ have given me a hope to escape from this trap. <BR>Yes, the people who got a first honor in Finance may know how to manage the money but they do not know how to come over their fear and emotion and to make the money work for them instead of they work for the money. Mr. Kiyosaki has given us many concrete and useful suggestions to deal with all the problems. If you can utilize the spirit of Kiyosaki, you probably will have a happy live and may be the billionaire in the coming future.
B000001C6M|5.0|This cd is awesome. This is the greatest debut of i band i have ever heard. Every song is good, no filler here.  Really outstanding tracks though are Metal Storm/Face The Slayer, Tormentor, and Crionics.  Slayer are a really great band, they play good and Dave is ... amazing on the drums.  Especially the double bass, its so crazy.  For the people who say the production ... on this album, what do you expect it to sound like it was recorded in the early/mid 80's! i think the production is perfect actually, the underground or basement feel (hahaha) really gives this album more definition.
0446525537|5.0|When I first began to read this book, I assumed that it would be an ordinary book that would be just like the rest of the thousands out there.  But I did one thing wrong.  I assumed.  This book is a touching story of love, hope and grief that you will remember forever.  When Landon Carter, an average teenage boy, falls for Jamie Sullivan, the Minister's daughter, he encounters a few problems.  When he finds out that Jamie is sick, he must learn to let go but still live.  Throughout this book, you will laugh, cry and in the end smile.  This heart-warming book about a girl who teaches others to live and to love will have a place in your soul forever.
B00005M989|4.0|Making a single-disc &quot;Hits&quot; collection for an artist like Prince is no easy task! Warner did a fine job with &quot;The Very Best Of Prince&quot; however, picking a nice mix of his biggest American and European hits and most popular tunes.<BR>Kicking off with his first real American hit &quot;I Wanna Be Your Lover&quot;, this CD is enhanced greatly by the fact that the songs here are presented in a chronological order, showcasing Prince's tremendous growth, and unfortunately also his downfall. Casual fans will be pleased to see that crowd-pleasers such as &quot;1999,&quot; &quot;When Doves Cry,&quot; &quot;Purple Rain,&quot; and &quot;Kiss&quot; are all present. One could complain about the exclusion of the brilliant 1985 US top ten single &quot;Pop Life&quot; or the international 1989 chart topper &quot;Batdance&quot;, but it's simply impossible to put all of his international hits on a single disc. The album does draw a bit heavily off &quot;Diamonds &amp; Pearls&quot; with the inclusion of four singles off that album, and while the title track and the fine &quot;Money Don't Matter 2 Night&quot; are pleasant tracks, they don't match up to his earlier work. This is where Prince stopped &quot;leading&quot; and started &quot;following&quot;.<BR>What we have here, though, is a fine sampler that might not neccesarily represent Prince's best work, but certainly his most popular from an international point of view.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|Acclaimed film director Darren Aronofsky returns with this dark and disturbing look at the highs and lows of drug dependancy in Brooklyn. Based upon the novel by Hubert Selby Jr. (who briefly appears in the movie), REQUIEM FOR A DREAM paints a pretty bleak picture of the tangled lives of four very individual people - each battling with their own inner demons.<br />The film opens with the introduction of the two main protaganists - Harry (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). We first meet them as they pawn a TV set owned by Harry's mother in the hope of gaining quick cash in order to buy heroin. We later learn that Harry always pawns this TV set whenever he needs a quick fix - thus, stating the low depths this guy will go to feed his own drug dependancy. This initial incident in the picture sparks off the eventual downward spiral that each of the characters encounter. We quickly meet Harrys' girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his own mother (Ellen Burstyn). Each character is drawn up to provide the audience with an easily identifiable dependancy to relate to. For instance, Harrys' widowed mother is obsessed with geting onto a game show and this slow interest begins to consume her entire life, blissfully unaware that her son is running a drugs racket with his girlfriend and best buddy. <br />Aronofsky throws in every kind of MTV trick in the book to dazzle his audience, which at some times is truly stunning - but, at others comes across as awkward and beguiling. You don't really feel connected to the foursome and their exploits neither interest or depress you in the way that they should (Check out TRAINSPOTTING for a more gritty take on the highs and lows of drug dependancy). The film offers no really likeable people - each character is either mentally depressed or self-obsessed, and no real hope is offered at all (I'm not saying I want a Hollywood style Drugs movie with a 'light at the end of the tunnel' type finale, but life has equal ups and downs, and all this movie is interested in is displaying a beautiful MTV style hell with pretty young people teetering on the edge of their own destruction).<br />The cast are very good, with the exception of lead Jared Leto. His pretty boy looks and dull acting style deny this movie with the strong emotional arm that it needs to succeed. You want to connect to him, but feel nothing for his plight and come away feeling cold and uninterested. Marlon Wayans drops his usual comedy schtick for a well deserved acting role that allows him to develop and excel - he shines in his limited screen time. Jennifer Connelly (who I remember as a little kid seeing her in LABRYNTH and that Dario Argento flick PHENOMENA/CREEPERS) too is pretty good, and she (along with the excellent Ellen Burstyn) pull this movie along giving it a gravitas that it truly needs. Aronofskys' direction is good, with art-house touches here and there - fused with a late 90s MTV sensability that at times dazzles and others infuriates - coming across like a rabid hybrid of David lynch and MIchael Bay.<br />The disc is good - This review refers to the UK Momentum Pictures release. A directors commentary is added plus additional deleted scenes (they don't detract or add to the film). Also, a raw 'making-of' documenatary is good and adds insight into a real making of a movie, ie: it looks pretty dull. Picture quality is good, highlighting Matthew Libatiques' excellent cinematography that changes mood and colour as quick as Aronofsky cuts his movie. All-in-all, a flashy, yet art-house attempt at creating another in the long line of underground american movies that depict the dark and seedy underbelly of the US. Not particularly rewarding or enticing. See FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS instead.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Many people are complaining that Morning View is too soft and that Incubus sold out. Yes it is a lot softer then their previous two records but whats wrong with something new? <br />How bout you people quit whining and give Incubus some props on creating new sounds and reinventing their music. <br />Yes, Morning View isn't perfect and probably doesn't deserve 5 stars but its definently good and I sure as hell like it.<br />The best tracks would have to be &quot;Nice to Know you&quot;, &quot;I Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Circles&quot; and &quot;Blood on the Ground.&quot;<br />So if you like this type of music, by all means buy it. And if you haven't gotten s.c.i.e.n.c.e (their first cd) then buy it because its their best record out.
B00005O3VC|5.0|The greatest, funniest, stupidest, most brilliant movie in the world. (Yes, it is both the stupidest and the most brilliant. Watch it and you'll see what I mean.) Every time i see it I find abnother instance with a woman smacking a cat against the wall... this movie is full of subtle things that you don't really catch until you've seen it multiple times. However, anyone with any sense of humor at all will have no problem seeing it multiple times (except my mom, b/c she's heard it all the way through from me and my dad and our incessant QUOTING). It is also the most quotable movie of all time, with lines like &quot;Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries&quot; and &quot;What are you going to do, bleed on me?&quot; and &quot;Wot, the curtains?&quot; and many others. To anyone who dares dislike this movie--&quot;NI!&quot;
B000002BUY|4.0|This is by far Incubus' best record ever. It is very fast and loud and almost all of the songs are pretty good. <br />My favorite ones are &quot;New Skin&quot;, &quot;Certain Shades of Green&quot;, and &quot;Redefine&quot;.<br />The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it can get a bit repetivive, but only slightly. <br />Still, this is one of the better CD's I have heard, right behind Linkin Park and ADEMA. So buy this now if you haven't already.
B000000993|5.0|Despite being almost 10 years old, this CD still compares quite favorably to anything released recently.  What's most noticeable about Undertow, in comparison to Aenima and Lateralus, is that it seems to be the most polished.  The album is tight and doesn't veer off into the near-insanity of the later albums.  Stand-outs include \\"Prison Sex,\\" \\"Sober,\\" \\"Undertow,\\" and \\"Flood.\\"  My only real gripe with this CD is the fact that \\"Disgustipated\\" is track 69....ha ha guys.  This makes it a real pain in the ... to listen to the song and burn the CD.  This isn't too much of an issue, though, because \\"Disgustipated\\" isn't terribly compelling to begin with.
B00004TRD8|5.0|this dvd is awesome, not to mention the movie itself. the movie takes place 7 years after the first one. sarah conner (linda hamilton) is put in a mental home because nobody believed her about the terminator. meanwhile, her son john (eddie furlong) is being pursued by two terminators the T-101 (arnold schwartennegar) and the T-1000 (robert patrick). which one is the good one, or the bad one? u have to get this dvd to find out. other cool features r the original script, trailers, documentries on how the movie was made, and two versions of the movie, the theatrical version, which is the version that was originally in the theatres, and the special edition, which contains about 40 minutes total of new scenes. GET THIS DVD IF U LIKE T2!
B00005B36H|5.0|At first, I had a very difficult time getting into Lateralus.  When first listening to it, you will probably gloss over a lot, or just be totally baffled by what you're hearing.  This is because Lateralus is easily the most complex of any album Tool have released.  There isn't a song on the album less than 6 minutes long (except for Parabol, which really is part of Parabola).  I'm actually surprised they managed to even pull a song off of the CD for radio play, in this era of 3 minute singles.  The band also seem to have learned from Aenima that having too many filler tracks can throw things off....this album has but 2, one of which is somewhat interesting.  An excellent follow-up to one of the better CD's of the 90's.
B000002GYG|5.0|I would like to correct a couple of possible misconceptions about this album.  A previous reviewer alluded to &quot;manufactured atmosphere&quot;.  Don't construe this comment in any kind of negative way.  I saw Tom Waits perform LIVE in the fall of 1975 at Alex Cooley's Electric Ballroom in Atlanta, GA.  Leon Redbone opened for him.  I have been to hundreds of live music concerts since, of all types, and this one remains the most memorable.  Notice that the album was released in October, 1975.  What you hear on this disc is EXACTLY what I saw &amp; heard Tom perform that night.  He had some props on stage, including old-fashioned gas pumps during &quot;Burma Shave&quot;.  The lighting effects were the best I've ever seen, and emphasized his expert use of cigarettes as props - his head &amp; face were often shrouded in a cloud of blue smoke.  What I'm getting at is the fact that this recording conveys almost perfectly the sense of being there, regardless of how it was done.  Indeed, it is obvious that Tom strove for this live nightclub effect, and achieved it beautifully.  The second misconception is the impression given by some reviewers that this is not one of his better ones.  I disagree, and would nominate this recording as being the best example of the &quot;essence&quot; of Tom Waits.  Others have correctly pointed out that he has inhabited 3 or 4 different personas during his career, with consequently different musical styles.  However, I think there is a thread of essential Waits that is present on all the recordings, from the early ones like &quot;Heart of Saturday Night&quot; to &quot;Bone Machine&quot; and &quot;Mule Variations&quot;, and I believe that we find that Essential TomWaitsness most perfectly captured on this recording. If you like this, you should like almost any of his old stuff, you would definitely like the &quot;trilogy&quot; &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;, &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;, and &quot;Frank's Wild Years&quot;, and you probably would also like the newer Tom, &quot;Bone Machine&quot;, &quot;Mule Variations&quot;, etc.  One of the 2 or 3 best in American Music.
B00000099Y|5.0|Aenima is not just the best Tool album.....it's also one of the best CD's released in the past decade.  It takes everything that made Tool what they were on Undertow and expands it.  This also means adding some flair and showmanship, and this mostly works in the band's favor.  A lot of songs which I consider to be definitive Tool songs are on this CD including &quot;Stinkfist,&quot; &quot;46 and 2,&quot; and &quot;Third Eye,&quot; the requisite 10-minute-plus song.  Others, like &quot;H.&quot; and &quot;Eulogy&quot; as well as the title track make this a CD worthy of anyone's collection.  This CD's only real problem in an apparent lack of focus...you may look and see that there are 15 tracks, but in reality, there are 9 true songs. 6 of the tracks are filler.  Some of it, like the track entirely in German, lends a lot to the creepy atmosphere.  Others, like the Ions track, are just total wastes of time.  Yet, all in all, Aenima still stands as the best Tool album, in my opinion.
0375507507|1.0|Off in the Colonies literature had its hey day in the 40s, 50s and 60s. Typically it features wild, rafish adventurers roughing it in the outbacks of East or Southern Africa. The wildlife and ecology are superb and there are many invisible servants to serve your every whim. There is play, sex, drugs, violence, extremes, \\"hardships,\\" and people who can be called characters with a mischievious laugh. But, alas, it's not the same any more. Well, so they say. If you've read this literature before (\\"White Mischief\\" comes to mind) and that's your entertainment then go for it. If you're a bit tired of that sort of thing and a bit tired of reading how the people and ecology of Africa are destroyed for profit then you may want to pass on Fuller's book. You're not missing anything. If you would like a more full portrait of present-day Africa, one grounded in the realities of most of the people living there, I would advise you to keep looking.
B00005UEAR|3.0|What a dilemma!  Absoutely great intrumental work but can't these guys hear the incongruities between the instrumental genius and the mechanical, assembly-line vocals?  I'm sure James Labrie is a nice guy, but his voice lacks the emotional and dramatic sophistication of the rest of the band (he seems way more comfortable and in his own element on his two &quot;Mullmuzzler&quot; solo projects). He is certainly technically proficient (and, in fairness, this effort is better than his singing on Metropolis II), but his style is just too contrived and plastic.  Maybe Mike could take over.  Or, maybe Ty Tabor could do some vocal tracks (check out Platypus's two CD's).  Or better still, give Jon Anderson a call or even Geddy Lee...Lenny Kravitz?...Corey Glover?  Anyhow, The instrumental part of the CD gets a solid FIVE STARS! Unfortunately the vocals only get one. Overall then, a generous three stars.  Worth the cash though, so give it go.
0780622553|5.0|\\"Dark City\\" explores areas never before explored in the history of film making. It is the ultimate science fiction/fantasy/horror movie.<BR>The movie is breathtaking. The visual atmosphere is dark, gritty, gloomy. The metropolis that the movie has created is something to drool over (artistically speaking). The story is so surreal and so huge that at times my jaw dropped after a humungous explanation. The special effects are great, as are the sets, the acting, and the execution. The editing could've been better; at times conversation timing seems incosistent; but I don't believe it is something to complain about. This is one of my top ten movies.<BR>Only one question nags me about this movie after watching it. SPOILER! Why and How does John have the special power? Maybe the film explained it in some subtle way, but I guess I just didn't catch on.
6304698798|5.0|my favorite movie ever, bar none. As a kid I went and saw it in the theatre 5 days in a row. i watched it every time it was on T.V., and bought it when VCR's came on the scene. Thank the heavens for DVD, now I can see the original scope of the film again.  I have seen this movie over 100 times and have been reciting lines from it for almost 25 years.  A wonderful movie, vastly entertaining. A total classic!!
B00005A46T|1.0|I had heard of Slipknot with the debut of their first major label album.  It was decent, but nothing to get excited over.  Then they have a new album coming out and everyone seems to be getting very pumped about it.  Not being a fan I didn't care to much, but one of my friends told me it was a great album and let me borrow his copy.  <BR>Thank god I didn't buy it!  This album is horrible and I should've given it 0 stars.  People tell me Joey is the most technical and fastest drummer ever.  Obviously none of these ... have heard of Pete Sandoval of Morbid Angel, the drumming god.<BR>Also I've been hearing people say ... that the guitar is excellent in this cd.  I will give them the fact that some of the riffs are a bit more technical than the first album, but they're no better than bands like Korn with their unoriginal, talentless playing.  ....<BR>Now we come to the vocal/lyrics.  Corey who was saying early this album was going to be just brutal seemed to use his clean voice more than on the original album.  ...  Also the lyrics are just laughable they're so stupid.  They appear as though they were written by an angry 12 year old wanna-be death metaler.  The Heretic Anthem is ridiculous, \\"I'm 666\\".  Ok there guys, real scary.<BR> ... I also noticed they only use about half the members of the band on the album.  What the [heck] is that all about?  These guys always talk about how it doesn't feel right unless the whole band is involved.  What a joke.<BR>All-in-all, a horrible album ...  This album makes me want to vomit in disgust, horrible. . .
B000002L68|5.0|I was in junior high school when &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was released and many of it's tracks were in regular rotation on the radio. This, in my opinion, is the defining album for Prince and the Revolution, and it is where my love of the group began.<br />The level of creativity exhibited on this album is remarkable. My favorite tracks seem to be those left out of the top-40. For instance, the instrumental portion of &quot;Computer Blue&quot; is incredible and one of my favorite moments on the album.<br />In short, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; is timeless. Whether or not you enjoyed the movie, the music stands in a league of it's own!
B000002H72|5.0|Doolittle is The Pixies most intelligent rock effort.  Not recommended for people with mullets, Camaros or who listen to the Scorpions.
B00005QW5X|5.0|There are so many things that I can see people getting put off by in this piece.  Transgender protagonist, botched sex change,  farrah wigs....but evne though I am not sure this ultimately holds up until the very end, this is a very literate, brilliant work that works on so many levels.  Concieved and directed by John Cameron Mitchell,  this is a combination of Plato, Glam, despair, repression(Hedwig is from East Germany) and comedy.  Much is mentioned about the music, the songs are amazing.  The other thing I would love to say is that any movie this bold should be applauded.  This is, of course, my bias.  This is a departure from formula, so I will excuse the dips in the flow of the piece.  Mitchell has created a rare blend of heart, experimentation and narrative that is bound to resonate for a long time.  And on top of that, the dvd contains a full length documentary on the creation of Hedwig....from club act to off broadway to movie.  Truly the origins of art.  Truly an amazing documentary for anyone who would like to find out about the way pieces like this are created.  OK, THE WARNING IS THAT THIS IS PROBABLY NOT FOR EVERYONE, BUT THIS IS AN AMAZING WORK.  GOT TO CHECK IT OUT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I listened to this cd, and i was greatly impressed by it.  It's simple songs sound like a flashback to old style beatles, and they are very easy to listen to and to enjoy.  I am so glad a band like this has finally come along to perhaps revive &quot;Rock n roll&quot;.
B00005RYQO|5.0|i think that the fast and the furoious was the best movie i love paul walker and jarule so much i think they have the tightest cars an the coolest stunts plus the hottes guys ... i definatly recomd this movie to ppl of about 11-29! girls an guys!
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends is more of a song-based album than a concept album, but it's still great. Key tracks include \\"Fake Plastic Trees,\\" \\"My Iron Lung,\\" \\"Black Star,\\" and \\"Street Spirit,\\" although like I said, every song is awesome in its own way. Also, the track arrangement is a lot smoother than that of Amnesiac, Radiohead's other song-based album. There's  the fast-slow-slow formula that works quite well for pop rock albums (yes, this actually IS good pop rock) in place here, and a TON of diversity, meaning that you'll probably find at least ONE song you like here... A warning, though. If you're one of those people obsessed with avent-garde music (like me), it will take you quite a while to like The Bends. And I wouldn't even TOUCH Pablo Honey.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Guy Ritche has a certain style common to his films.  Yet \\"Snatch\\" succeeds where \\"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\\" could not.  It is fast paced and very will executed.  Each character is bigger than life, full of silly quirks and all are very funny.  The DVD does not disappoint.  Loaded with extras, including a very amusing detailing of Guy Ritche's system of \\"fining\\" the cast and crew for various infractions during filming.  Cell phone going off during a take costs you so many pounds.  Late for crew call...that'll cost you, and so on.  Quite amusing.  In every way, fans of this movie will love this disc.
B000002MP2|4.0|i was a little skeptical about getting this album, because i was rather partial to Insomniac, which is a lot harder and angrier compared to Dookie.  But i was pleasently surprised.  though not as hard, it's full of what i like to call classic Green Day. <BR> <BR> 1) Burnout- Great song, i liked the drum part towards the end.<BR> 2) Having a Blast- my favorite song on the album, strong, angry, driving<BR> 3) Chump- i liked this one too.  i don't mind the huge instrumental towards the end.  it sounds cool.<BR> 4) Longview- very popular, but not my favorite.  i liked the bass part<BR> 5) Welcome to Paradise- i honestly like the Kerplunk version better, but thats just me<BR> 6) Pulling Teeth- great lyrics, love this one<BR> 7) Basketcase- the classic.  these lyrics are awesome<BR> 8) She- good song.  good bass<BR> 9) Sassafras Roots- one of my favorites, Billie muses \\"so why are you alone wasting your time? you could be with ME wasting your time...\\"<BR>10) When I Come Around- very true, wise song. some people consider it a ballad, but they're stupid. this is no ballad.<BR>11) Coming Clean- a little short, but nevertheless true and timeless<BR>12) Emenius Sleepus- really liked this one.  awesome guitar part.<BR>13) In the End- fast paced song about a guy apathetically mourning the loss of his girl to her own selfish tendencies.  good song.<BR>14) F.O.D.- one of the best on the album.  starts out as an acoustic ballad and morphs into a hard angry rock song (F.O.D stands for 'F*ck Off and Die')<BR>(**) \\"All By Myself\\"- okay, let's just say the first time i heard this, my first though was: 'what the HECK was that?!'<BR> <BR>If you a fan of Green Day, get this cd.  but don't forget to check out they're early stuff, Kerplunk and 1039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hour and such.  you won't be disappointed.
B000002L9M|5.0|My title says it all: true, &quot;Black Celebration&quot; is never optimistic, but it is surprisingly uplifting and breathtaking. It empowers, informs (I especially like the observation of society in &quot;New Dress&quot;), inspires, and is beautiful through and through.
B00005JKQX|1.0|Let me start by saying that I went to this movie with great expectations. I am a fan of Russell Crowe and Ron Howard and had high hopes. After watching A Beautiful Mind I found it entertaining with good acting, but certainly not Oscar worthy. The strength of the movie, which most people cite as their reason for liking it, is the love between John Nash and his wife Alicia. When I learned how much the creators of this movie had rewritten the true story of John Nash, I went to see the movie again and found that it had lost its power.  Essentially the story as told is almost a complete facbrication. Some reviewers say that this fact should be overlooked because the movie was never advertised as a documentary or as being true, but only based on a true story. In theory that would be fine until you look at recent history and see how other movies with similiar problems were treated in the press and by The Academy of Motion Pictures. Two years ago The Hurricane was eliminated from Oscar consideration when it was learned that the screenwriters had taken liberties with the true story of Hurricane Carter. Last year the movie The Patriot was blasted for its fabricated slant on history, and that movie was never advertised as being based on a true story. In the case of A Beautiful Mind the problems with the script are too serious to allow this film to be given special treatment from Academy voters. Lets look at what the screenwriter left out or added to make John Nash's story more audience friendly.<br />1. No mention is made of John Nash's numerous affairs.<BR>2. The only problems we see in the Nash's marriage concern his mental illness.<BR>3. No mention is made of the illegitimate child that John Nash fathered or the fact that he abandoned this child without support.<BR>4. No mention was made that Nash and his wife got divorced.<BR>5. No mention was made of Nash's arrest of public lewdness in a men's bathroom, or his bisexuality.<BR>6. No mention was made of many attempts to renounce his American citizenship.<BR>7. At the end of the movie he gives a gushy speech professing his love for his wife at his Nobel Prize acceptance. In truth this never happened...<BR>8. When told that his monetary prize for winning the Nobel was $ 310,000.00 his comment was \\"The Money Could be Better.\\" (Also in Parade, 2-24)<br />The real John Nash and his story has almost no resemblance to the version presented on the screen.  Now go watch the movie again and compare the two versions, when you do you will find that the movie is not as powerful. Its too bad that Ron Howard and the Screenwriters felt that they had to commercialize John Nash's story.  I don't believe this movie deserves special treatment just because it is a Dreamworks production.
B000001EAQ|4.0|This is a rougher U2, some of their edgiest stuff since Boy and October.  It has the slam of R&B\\", but the loudness of Punk (U2 was originally a punk band), but has the deep production techniques of Techno.  We are almost seeing an old and new U2.<br />U2 is always the political band, which merely means they are sublimating their passions. \\"Discoth&egrave;que\\" is both a tip of the hat and a shaking of the fist to the current nightlife in Europe. Trust me, I lived in Portugal for two years.<br />\\"Do You Feel Loved,\\" and \\"Mofo\\" are really musical pieces first, and substance second.  You get caught up in in the edginess of Edges craftsmanship.  I think Bono sdaid that Edge fell in love with his guitar again on this album.<br />\\"If God Will send His Angels\\" reminds us that U2 is a Christian band, and that they have a soul. This song is one long indictment of the problems of the world.<br />\\"Staring at the Sun\\" is conceptually the clone of Zooropa's \\"Numb,\\" how we prefer doing anything and everything expect looking at the truth.  I wonder is there is a pun played here, with \\"Sun\\" meaning \\"Son.\\"  SO this song would then be an indictment of religious marshmallows who prefer looking at Christ rather than following Christ.<br />\\"Last night on Earth\\" taps the apocalyptic fervor of the pre-Y2K days.  After all, the world can't keep up with the way things are going, so something is about to snap.<br />\\"Gone\\" is a pure lounge lizard piece.<br />\\"Miami\\" is a tribute tone poem to a rather fun city.  Watch out for the reference to \\"petrol,\\" which is British for gas.<br />\\"The Playboy Mansion\\" is another lyric-heavy, almost rap, indictment of religion again set over a quasi-disco-R&B three-chord pattern.  As to the religious indictment, if the shoe fits, wear it.<br />\\"If you Wear That Velvet Dress\\" sports a husky voiced Bono calling out to a woman who has already gone.  For some reason, this song sounds deep blue, and conjures up images of night in my mind.<br />\\"Please\\" is a somewhat forgettable song that was made a single.<br />\\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" has replace \\"40\\" as the outro in U2 Concerts.  After having criticized everyone, Bono finally criticizes Jesus the dead man.  True this is blasphemy, bout you do get a sense of Bono's passion melting into frustration.  To their credit, U2 is an activist and charity band, so their hands a quite dirty and calloused in serving other people.  Moreover they are aware of the conditions and causes of poverty and how so many people have it in their power to change things, but who don't.  Therefore, this song would be better called \\"Wake up Dead Men,\\" since \\"God is not dead, nor does he sleep.\\"<br />Some people have not forgiven U2 for this foray, which is really just the outworkings of the \\"Actung, Baby!\\" and \\"Zooropa\\" albums.  They have abandoned this deer-trtail, and have retuned to successful ground with \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\"  But, as always, the pleasure is in the journey taken.orgettable song that was made a single.<br />\\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" has replace \\"40\\" as the outro in U2 Concerts.

6305307261|5.0|Werner Herzog's vision of the classic Nosferatu is without equal in its beauty AND horror. Of all the vampire films produced since the 60s, other than Francis Ford Coppola's \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", no other director has realized so rich a portrayal of such a horrific creature.<br />The opening sequence, set in a charnel house or a cave, is a rolling long shot of thousands upon thousands of human skulls piled floor to ceiling, with an extraordinarily creepy and haunting choral music background. One of the most disturbing openings of any horror film I've seen ever. The first time you see it, it leaves an indelible impression on your psyche, setting the stage for what will follow.<br />Klaus Kinski's almost literal \\"inhabitation\\" of Nosferatu is enhanced by the superbly realistic makeup and prosthetics he wears to effect the look of a gargoyle-turned-vampire. With piercing black eyes like those of a rodent, his is the most intense screen portrayal of any vampire character. Not only he is physically intense (with an almost humbling mien), but he is also a very \\"human\\" Nosferatu, in that his sense of aloneness in the world, and his despair is so palpable as to render the darkness around him so much the bleaker.<br />The cinematography draws the landscapes around his castle and the interiors in the brightest of whites and the most sombre of blacks. <br />If you have a choice between the original-language German w/the English subtitles, or the dubbed version, do yourself a tremendous favor and view it in the original. The dubbed English so dilutes the mood of the film, while German fits the story's mood and dialogue so well.<br />This Nosferatu is much more than just a horror film, it also brings poetry and romance to the vampire genre.<br />Stunning.
0679720200|4.0|I personally view this book as a character study of an extremely self-absorbed individual. It's fascinating how differently the main character sees events from that of other people as a result of his extreme propensity to look inward. Overall, I get the impression that Camus intended to warn readers of the dangers of worshipping individualism by showing an extreme form of it.
0060934913|5.0|As the daughter of a highly successful restauranteur, my view of the biz is from a somewhat different perspective: the neglected family's point of view.  The author does a great service to his readers when he tells you exactly what a time- and soul-sucking trap owning a restaurant can be.  I've watched countless restaurants fail, yet dumb hope always springs anew, and there's always some [person] who thinks he can make a go of it with a lot of enthusiasm, an ingenious \\"theme\\", and a few good recipes.<br />As the author points out, a love of food isn't enough.<br />Kudos to the author for a sometimes disgusting, sometimes delicious, but NEVER boring book.  He's inspired me to eat Japanese tonight.
B000056K04|1.0|To be fair, I cannot write a truthful review of the album ' everyday'..i have only heard 2 songs, i believe. My review is for the band..and for the non-fans like myself who wince in pain with the sheer torture of having to hear anything by this band. the world beat-tinged rhythms, the hiccupy-nasal abomination of vocals..this my friends, is absolute torture for anyone who is not a fan of this band. i have no problems with these guys, i am sure they are nice guys and talented musicians, but if i see one more neo-hippie, college-age, follow the crowd, daddy bought me a new jeep, i'm really rich but i want to give the pretense of world-travelling, peace-loving, poverty-chic deadhead/phish/dmb fan, i'm going to vomit all over my Ratt t-shirt ( come on, i'm only kidding..although i still like Ratt..). i don't know, i just see this band sell out huge arenas in like 10 minutes and i scratch my head ( not literally ) in amazement. in closing, i do have one request..that patchouli stuff that you phish/dmb-type people like to wear..PLEASE...PLEASE I BEG YOU..STOP!! we must put an end to this godawful patchouli stink once and for all. who's with me? who has ever been in a restaurant, or a movie theatre..any place really, and not smelled that..that..ODOR. horrible..just horrible. that big fat guy you always see in line at burger king took a dump this morning, and i'll lay odds that it smelled a hell of a lot better than that patchouli abomination. well, i've said enough..probably too much. have a nice, patchouli-free day. Long live rock and roll..

B000002H6C|5.0|This is Metallica's last great album, right before they went commercial. They had just mourned the death of bass player Cliff Burton and they put their anger on record. My two favorite songs are Blackened and Dyers Eve, maybe Metallica's fastest songs. It probably has Kirk Hammets best solo's too. I kind of like Master Of Puppets a little better but this is mandatory Metallica music.

B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears is the Madonna of a new generation. Girls look up to her while boys lust after her. Britney is a win-win situation. Spears explains how she feels on this album which is a smart way to express to her family, bodyguards, and even critics what's on her mind. \\"Britney,\\" is a unique blend of different styles of music which is evenly distributed throught your 40 minutes of listening pleasure. On Britney's first two albums the music was mostly mixed with monster pop choruses and a ballad in between. With \\"Britney,\\" the pop fades into R&B tunes with pop tracks far and few in between. The standout track is, \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,\\" where Spears expresses her state of mind. Overall, \\"Britney,\\" is a great album which I strongly recommend. Below is a track by track review of the tracks on \\"Britney.\\"<BR>1)I'm a Slave 4 U (5/5)<BR>An irresistibly dark track with a sexy bumpy chrous<BR>2)Overprotected (5/5)<BR>With a chous that makes your stomach hurl Overprotected is completely poptastic<BR>3)Lonely (5/5)<BR>A nice R&B track with a little rap breakout in the end<BR>4)I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman (5/5)<BR>A ballad in which Britney explains how she is growing up and she is not a little girl anymore<BR>5)Boys (5/5)<BR>Slick hip-hop with her most sexy beat to date<BR>6)Anticipating (4.2/5)<BR>A nice summery song; pure pop <BR>7)I Love Rock 'N' Roll (5/5)<BR>No, not rock music but a light R&B mixed with a hard pop beat<BR>8)Cinderella (5/5)<BR>A dance track with a chorus you cannot help but sing along with<BR>9)Let Me Be (4.0/5)<BR>Not a very good track but a very strange beat with powerful lyrics<BR>10)Bombastic Love (5/5)<BR>A cute pop song that seems out of place on this more mature Britney sounding record<BR>11)That's Where You Take Me (4.5/5)<BR>Britney now changes to a two step vibe with a nice lullaby beat<BR>12)What It's Like To Be Me (5/5)<BR>Definatly a new type of music not pop or R&B but a fast dance type beat that you will not turn off; even after 100 listens
B000003TAR|3.0|You know, listening to this album is depressing in a way:  First to think that Kurt Cobain (or anyone for that matter) could be so unhappy with life as he was a year after this release, and Second, for the potential Nirvana had, even beyond this album.  But Depression, isolation, self-reflection were all big subject matters for Kurt, and this album was no exception.  Critics tactlessly called In Utero \\"a mere commercial follow-up to 'Nevermind,'\\" due to the album's deficiency of mega-successful singles and relatively low sales.  But once again, who gives a damn what the media thinks?  Cobain's message included self-efficiency and the irony of commmercial accomplishment. This album is a far better record biographically for Cobain and more audacious than \\"Nevermind.\\"  It contained Kurt's memoirs, basic social truths, and even a few \\"secrets of life.\\"  \\"In Utero's\\" opener, \\"Serve the Servants,\\" finds the band in it's familiar position; sitting like kings on top of the alternative tidal wave.  Cobain speaks flippantly of \\"self appointed judges\\" and teen angst \\"paying off.\\"  He compares his position with the press as being yet another victim of the Salem Witch Trials.  He principally shoves a long, ominous finger in the media's face.  More of the same is found in \\"Scentless Apprentice,\\" though his subject matter could change due to both his esoteric style and his general talent for writing.  Fans willingly praise Kurt for several things, but tend to overlook that the man had a definite way with words, and was his gloomy but honest lyrics that hit the right ears at the right time to change rock forever.<br />\\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is one of those defining musical moments.  It summed up exactly what was happening in music at the time, and if ever there was made a time capsule for the grunge era, this single would fit in nicely with the flannel and \\"Singles\\" Soundtrack.  \\"Rape Me\\" showcases more sarcasm, as does \\"Dumb,\\" \\"Very Ape,\\" and \\"Pennyroyal Tea (Penny Royalty).\\"  The murky lyrics and string of gloomy songs tend to lean toward monotony, but they were what occupied Cobain's mind at the time.  Nothing else mattered in his art, and that's what defines a great writer.  \\"Francis Farmer...\\" was yet another stab at Pearl Jam and other bands that they vocally criticised for riding the bandwagon after Nirvana had paved the way, though accuracy to those assertions lay more in the eye of the beholder.  Blotchy fragments of \\"Milk It\\"'s verses, \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter,\\" \\"Tourette's\\" inaccessable lyrics (though purposefully done), and the akward chorus of \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" hint at an urgency to get out new material.  Though they also hint at an artistic undertaking.  Venturing to new plains will either leave the art inconsistant or make it bold and daring.  These and other parts of \\"In Utero\\" fall into both of these catagories, which is why it lack's the solidity of \\"Nevermind,\\" but is much more rewarding.  The album closes with \\"All Appologies.\\"  With its light mood and non-controversial lyrics, it is perhaps the most radio friendly song in the Nirvana catalouge, but not quite up to par with some of their more daring work.  Though the album suffers from musical oddities, self-pity, gloom, and a few other minor things, it is nontheless essential.  While \\"Nevermind\\" is far more commercial, Nirvana die-hards will probably reach for \\"In Utero\\" before the former.  And while \\"Nevermind,\\" in the wake of it's groundbreaking sound, popularity, flawless production, and classic songs rises it to a class of its own (9 or 10/10), it is not as artistic or emotional of the 7/10 \\"In Utero.\\"  A classic moment in gruge/punk/alternative/rock history.
055321263X|5.0|THE WOMAN IN WHITE is one of those books that wants to make a deal with you. If you can, as Coleridge put it, temporarily suspend your disbelief about the difficulty of such elements as two women who are virtually identical to one another in appearance, on the astonishing proliferation of sheer coincidence, and the improbability that someone could not prove to others that they are who they say that they are, this book will provide you with some of the most exciting moments in all of literature. Yeah, much of it is absurdly farfetched. But I know of very, very few novels that have left me as breathless as this one. There were several moments that left me entirely unable to put it down.<br />The novel also contains one of the greatest villains in the history of literature. In fact, I cannot think of a more delightful villain in English literature than the outrageous Count Fosco. There are very, very many reasons to read this novel, but even if all the others were not to exist, this novel would bear reading just to become acquainted with Count Fosco. Brilliant, obese, larger-than-life, sentimental, eloquent, arrogant, conceited, eloquent, and heartless, Count Fosco is grand in the way that a James Bond villain is grand. Interestingly, as I read the novel for the first time, Fosco kept putting me in mind of another great fat villain in literature and movies: Kasper Gutman of THE MALTESE FALCON. Imagine my delight when I learned that there was a 1948 film version of THE WOMAN IN WHITE, and that Sydney Greenstreet, the same person who portrayed Kasper Gutman in THE MALTESE FALCON, played the role of Count Fosco. I'm not sure he possesses the physical grace attributed to Fosco, but he definitely has the eloquence and charisma.<br />If you haven't read this book, please do yourself a favor and do so. Only . . . make sure you have plenty of time and that you don't have to be interrupted. There are times when you won't want to stop.

B00005OB0A|5.0|Kylie really delivers in her newest work 'Fever.' This is nothing but dance from top to bottom, with a few danceable ballads. My favourite tracks would have to be Fever, Can't Get You Out Of My Head, Love Affair, Burning Up, and Fragile. The closest you get on this album to a slow, romantic Kylie is on the track Burning Up, but it doesn't last long! She'll have you up and bouncing with the heavey disco pop rhythms! I also recommend her album Light Years, which is much more of a feel-good album.

B00005OWEG|4.0|While i really enjoyed this version of the film what worries me is that the aspect ratio seems to be 1:1.85 instead if 2.35 which was what the original apocalypse now was. Is this a transfer error or did the director use 1.85 as the aspect ratio, though the trailer on the dvd seems to be in 2.35. Can someone please enlighten me on this one

B00004XMTH|4.0|I think that this is definitely a must for any CATS fan or musicals fan. The video is well cast. They are all fabulous singers and dancers. The costumes are great. However, it isn't a great representation of the show, because watching a video of this particular musical doesn't give you the interaction you get from the live version. Aside from that and a few editing mishaps, this video is well put together and enjoyable. It's a great way to keep the magic of this show alive forever!
1563890119|5.0|I never wanted to touch Off-Stream comics. I was happy and content with Supes, Bats, Spidey and the X-Men. Still while on vacation my Mom let me get some books - and I was pondering wether to get Sandman. I looked at the first page, wondering and began reading some of it. Before the first page even ended, I felt that I would love this book. And I did! It is literally our Myths taking form!<br />I always thought \\"For Mature Readers\\" meant that it was \\"Adult\\" Stuff that a kid wouldn't be suitable to read. That, off my head, made me think of sex, violence and gore. Thats why I love Mainstream Comics so much, they are safe to read. Still I took the risk, going on a hunch that it would be good. It isn't mainly about any of the stuff I thought a \\"Mature\\" title would have. Though there is some gross and violent stuff that you'd want to keep away from little kids, still this book is just that good! It's safe for anybody who doesn't have the mind or inclination to go stab your eyes out with spikes. Though only violance of that nature is small and not used without reason.<br />Death is my favorite character - cute and cheery! Sandman himself is an impressive character, who we see lost his Kingdom and now has to rebuild.<br />This series was so good, reading, that I went ahead and ordered the rest of the series. Like one of my favorite series \\"Starman\\" Sandman has a begining and end, like any serious novel would have.<br />Interesting fact I heard: A future issue won an award for Fantasy. Some people were mad becuase they thought a comic wasn't serious enough to be considered. This book is mature in it's intelligence and ellagance that it can match any \\"serious\\" novel anyday!

0140067477|5.0|Winnie the pooh has got to be the safest &quot;person&quot; to identify with that the world has to offer.  Not only is pooh a taoist master, but he also embodies the healthiest Freudian super ego I have ever seen.  As to the reviewer below commenting about the vinegar tasters, it sums up exactly my inability to embrace buddhism.  The ideal of buddism is to be happy, but they leverage a reflex mechanism in the human brain to do it, by looking at horrors of the world, as does christianity, as does the ancient aztecs with their live human sacrafice.  It does work, but Pooh is just so much more direct for those people who have the temperment for looking at the world without a filter like identifying with perceptions of suffering.  Pooh is just happy because he IS happy.  He doesn't need the psychological transformations offered by other religions.  So I just want to give him a big hug, not for being a paradigm of anything, but for being a cute cuddly pooh bear who is always there with his childlike, taoist simplicity.
B00000JH09|5.0|With a searing sound of harmonics, this album starts with a huge impact....<BR>BAM, the drums and bass smack you in the face with velocities that would make michael schumaker jealous.<BR>Twisting through the opening track, and into the next three before the pace gets changed.<BR>The production on this is amazing, but then rick rubin(producer) has the touch of midas when he goes into the studio with anyone.<BR>The guitars sound like neumatic drills in parts, while at other moments they have a warm and bright, almost perfect clean sound.<br />Track 5 - SPIDERS<BR>\\"Your thoughts, and dreams are no longer sacred, as they are exposed to a weapon known as remote viewing and monitoing\\" - Serj Tankian<br />Politically driven to get a message to the people of the world to WAKE UP, time is short, and life needs no time-wasters.<BR>The message that Violence and Hatred are the HUMAN RACE's biggest downfalls, and lowest forms of energy to be emmited by all.<BR>And that coruption and underhanded deals are what run the day to day operations in all countries, and it is high time that we stand up as people and command the governments to provide to all as equals, and not segrigate society into classes, religions, colors or even races...(including america...)<BR>The music is hard hitting and heavy, with elements of old metal (slayer, Sepultura) and some elements of opratic rock (the who) and a completely individual thing that make their sound a trademark for this band.<BR>Reigning from ARMENIA, these guys have seen genocide being committed first hand, by the american government in turkey, which actually started as early as 1915. <BR>And so have a very strong view on the way things are really done behind closed doors, away from public eyes. And this view comes across strong in the lyrics of singer SERJ TANKIAN, as well as the music written by guitarist DARON MALAKIAN and Bassist SHAVO ODADJIAN.<BR>And we cant forget to mention the tension building drummer JOHN DOLMAYAN, who creates many moments in this album that could not exist without him<br />track 8 - WAR?<BR>\\"WE first fought the heathens in the name of religion, then communism, and now in the name of drugs and terrorism. Our excuses for global domination always change.\\" - SERJ TANKIAN<br />with 13 songs between 1.5 mins and 4,5 mins long, this is the debut album of the century for the 1900's.<BR>To be able to tour the world for 4.5 years on one release is incredable. Especially when you cant release the songs on the mainstream radio networks world wide.<br />After five years , this album still remains a fave, and gets constant flogging in my cd player....<BR>a must for the lover of something fresh and new.
B000001FI7|5.0|this is exactly what is missing in the music industry.i wont insult this by mentioning the scrubs that pollute the airwaves in massive quantities.this is one of those rare cds in which every song is excellent.i was fortunate enough to catch them live at roseland and they were even better.my favorite is roads.talk about pure emotion,not over produced/studio gimmicktry! roads,in my opinion,is one of the all time great ballads.and that orchestral break can reduce the macho-est of men to tears.just simply beautifull.although her voice isnt as strong as id like,it suits the mood perfectly.originality certainly paid off big time here and maybe it will start a welcome trend.with every slob having their crap on DVD,how long will the wait for this to be tranfered to DVD is my question.
B000002GYW|5.0|IF you like the stuff Gram Parson's did with the Byrds, you might not like this, it's more esoteric than Gram. However, if you like the Eagles other music, you'll probably like this, it's got this element of pure western music that is better than the country hits of today. I highly recommend this effort, it's got an undercurrent that's missing from today's country...
0800141601|5.0|I wasn't really looking forward to seeing this movie, but my friend and I decided to watch it just for kicks. Now it's quite hard to impress us, as we get bored easily, but this movie captivated us from the very start. I know some people are mad that it's not \\"historically correct\\" and \\"they should be speaking Latin\\" and to that I say, WHO CARES!!!!!! This movie had a diabolical plot that kept me guessing from the beginning,and the characters are even better! 2/3 of movie- goers have no clue what the \\"correct\\" outfit for Arthurian times is, and I think the clothes they had were perfectly fine. The setting for the movie was beautiful, and each actor was perfect for their part. Do yourself a favor and go rent this movie for any occasion, for it appeases all people. It has drama, romance, comedy, and violence, good elements for any movie seperately, but when pieced together give the movie a fresh, hot spin. This is my all- time favorite movie!
0385505833|1.0|Someone call Clive Cussler and tell him this piece of amateurish drivel supplanted _Inca Gold_ as the worst novel I've read. Having never picked up a Grisham novel before, I was expecting something at least clever or well-written, based on his popularity.  Sadly, this novel is to good writing what any Jim Carrey performance is to good acting; that is to say, not remotely related.
0345440900|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I also have to disagree with those who would call this book theoretically incorrect (especially a certain lactation specialist who feels the need to let us know that her children were all breastfed - does this make her more credible?).  My advice - try it on a REAL BABY - because it works!  <br />At five weeks, my pediatrician and I were convinced that my son had colic.  If he wasn't eating or sleeping, he was crying constantly, and the only way we could get him to sleep for more than an hour during the night was to put him in our bed.  Once we decided it was colic, we gave up trying to determine what his cries meant.  Thank God for Tracy Hogg.  My husband and I were desperate for anything that would stop the crying and make our son happy.  I read the book, started listening to my son's cries, and put him on the EASY schedule.  Within 2 days, he was sleeping through the night in his own crib (without having to make him &quot;cry it out&quot;) and he is truly an &quot;Angel Baby&quot; during the day.  As it turns out, my son was overfed and overtired, but by no means colicy.<br />Whether Tracy has the &quot;correct&quot; credentials or not, she gave my son a voice.  I now take the time to listen to him and watch his body language.  And what a difference it has made.  Everyone in our household is happier, and how can that be wrong?  <br />Her best piece of advice is &quot;Start as you mean to go on.&quot;  So, don't rock your infant to sleep if you don't want to still be doing it when he's 2 or 3 years old.  So many of my friends have made similar mistakes and they are sadly unaware that it's their own actions causing the problems.<br />Kudos to Tracy for this inciteful book.  I'm giving it to all my pregnant friends.
B00005Y1Y3|5.0|This is why the legend of Jim Morrison and the Doors lives on. A powerful look into the raw unrehearsed live concert energy that the Doors are best at. Morrisons improvised lyrics and the music flow together and leave you wanting more. These tracks are not new to us but they are different than we remember.An outstanding and necessary trip back to the day when The Doors filled stadiums and left audiences aghast at the show unfolding in front of their eyes. This will not disappoint.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Rufus Wainwright has a soul wrenching voice and the lyric style to make everyday themes unique and touching again.  His sense of timing, harmony and the variety of mood and tempo make this work easy to listen to repeatedly without ever tiring of it.
B00004Z459|5.0|I got this cd 6 mounths ago and i still love it and im not sick of hearing it like other cd. I love all the songs on it (well, mybe accept song 11...) anyways this cd rox so buy it... ^_^
0553213105|4.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is possibly one of the most beautifully written novels of all time.  As one turns the pages of this timeless classic, she is brought into the wonderfully romantic world of Elizabeth Bennet and the rest of the so vividly depicted characters.  One becomes familiar with the lavish mansions and picturesque countryside that envelope the setting of this novel, and at once becomes a part of the drama that surrounds the young women on whom the novel focuses.<br />By far, my favorite character in Pride and Prejudice was Mr. Bennet.  His quick wit and ability to survive in a household filled with marriage obsessed females are prime examples of the wonderful humor Austen brings to the novel.  Another character I became quite fond of was Lizzy, for as a young female myself, I felt that the obstacles and tribulations she faced throughout the novel, especially the pressures put on her by her family and society,  were timeless trials that all women go through.<br />The turn of events in this magical novel leaves the reader both enthralled and ultimately satiated with the happy endings for the main characters.  The plot is both unexpected and fulfilling at the same time, for Austen's writing is, at times, more gratifying for her characters than one could even devise in her own imagination.  As the reader  enters the world of the Bennets she gains a new perspective and appreciation of this era that lasts throughout the novel and leaves you thirsty for more at the end.
B00000I8UK|5.0|I'm afraid that this, my first review on Amazon, is primarily aimed at the 'music fan from Carlisle, PA USA'. I was actually searching for info on Dolphy boxed sets when I noticed that there is a newly remastered version of this incredible work now available...and thought I might check out some reviews. Then I read the drivel written by said 'music fan'. Now, I would just like to say firstly that the comment that all people who like this album (and by implication, all post hard-bop jazz) are 'elitist pseudo-snobs' is insulting and moronic. Secondly, the remark that this is 'the kind of music that has contributed to the slow death of jazz as a mainstream American artform' is about as wide of the mark as any kind of supposedly intelligent comment I've ever read by any one about music, ever. Indeed, it seems far more likely to me that it is the very conservatism of mainstream jazz and its refusal to continue to explore and experiment that has lead to the 'death' of Jazz. Anyway, had to get that off my chest. For anyone else, I really think you should buy this album. If you don't like it, at least you will have heard something unique. In any case, this is really not totally 'free' music - I think that Dolphy shared with Mingus an interest with tonally centred improvisation with occasional moves 'out'. As such, it is a good introduction to the early avant garde jazz of the 1960s. Finally, the rhythm section is, for my money, one of the finest ever assembled in Jazz history.
B00005QB42|5.0|This is a beautiful album.  Her voice is wonderful to listen to.  Each track could easily be put on repeat, and listened to for a while.  None of the tracks were disappointing- the album has a nice, cohesive feel.  I'm very glad I got it.  It's almost sixty minutes long too.
B00005JKES|1.0|Add mine to the list of complaints that the pilot isn't included in the set.  This is one set that I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before buying because this one of the first TV shows that I really loved.  I got my set and sat down with my wife to show it to her since she had never seen it, and found out about the missing pilot.  (After going back to the menu and hitting play episode 1 over and over).  I would have appreciated a sticker or a warning label on the set, or at least some mention on the box that it was incomplete.  <br />So the CD's will sit on a shelf until I get around to ordering the poor quality import.<br />I actually find myself feeling pretty mad that they try to gloss over the fact that they don't include the pilot with a little card that says \\"The Story Far\\".  It's almost like selling a DVD of Star War's with the first 30 min missing.  <br />The CD set is worthless without the pilot which set the tone.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I am a Britney fan and I am proud of it. For all those people out there who hasn't bought this cd and said its horrible, you are wrong. I have all 3 cds and this is the best. She has grown up and if you are to ignorant to read what I have to say, you shouldn't be looking Britney's new cd. Here is what I think of each song:<BR>1. I'm a Slave 4 You ~ A+ I like this song. It doesn't me anytihng bad at all. Its saying she's growing up and people can't see that... <BR>2. Overprotected ~ A this is song is pretty cool. Its about her once again.<BR>3. Lonely ~ A+ this is one of my favorites<BR>4. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman ~ A this is probably the song that relates to her the most and one of almost every fan's favorite. am i rite?<BR>5. Boys ~ B- I dont really like this song, though i like the beat.<BR>6. Anticipating ~ A this song seriously sounds like its from Janet Jackson. Sounds pretty good.<BR>7. I Love Rock N' Roll ~ B- I used to likehis song because I heard the original, this version is bad cause she made it more modern.<BR>8. Cinderella ~ A++++++++ this is my number one, all time favorite song of this album. It shows girl power, attitude, and that Britney got a great voice.<BR>9. Let Me Be ~ A+ another good song<BR>10. Bombastic Love ~ A- sounds a bit weird this song.<BR>11. That's Where You'll Take Me ~ A if you have a stressful day, its good to listen to this song. Very soothing<BR>12. What Its Like To Be Me ~ A+++++++++ second favorite song. yes even though Justin wrote this song its good(cause I hate NSYNC).<br />If you don't believe me, buy it yourself.
0061040967|5.0|This is the first illustrated Terry Pratchett book I have owned, and it has brought to life each character as I have imagined - the only exception being Carrot, and that can be forgiven (for now).  Since the illustrations are works of art in their own right, the added bonus of TP narrative just thrusts the whole, combined, into the realm of a superlative treat for the brain and eyes - almost sensory overload, but that's something I personally enjoy.
0060278234|5.0|Lireal is one of the very books I've ever read, and I've read two that are very, very hard to beat to make it into the top (of my list, anyway). And this one followed directly in Sabriel's footsteps and into the top three. Outstanding discription, along with a very ensnaring plot are sure to make countless numbers of people read it over and over again. Add the many twists and turns, and it leaves even the most proud reader begging for more.<br />The only thing that truly irked me was that it's a 'to be continued.' Now I have to wait for Abhorsen to come out.
0440224764|4.0|A man by the name of Patrick Lanigan was hired by a law firm and was considered a partner.  He fakes his own death by acting like he was in a burning car, when really he wasnt.  All that was left of him was said to be ashes, when really at his funeral he was there watching.  After his funeral he ran to Brazil with 90 million dollars that he stole from the lawfirm.  This book keeps you wanting to read more and more.  At times it is slow but comes back with a bang.  Grisham uses great detail in this novel so at all times you know what is happening and what is around the situation.  He leaves his money with his accomplice Eva Miranda, so it is hard to trace.  Then on a hunt for Lanigan is a man by the name of Jack Stephano who has spent many years looking for him.  When he catches him he asks him where the money is he dosent know because he gave the money to Miranda and he dosent know where she is.  They caught Lanigan and are now taking him back to where this all started, and to have a trial that will be unforgetible.  The book keeps you interested in the beginning, and fades in the middle, and jumps out at the end.  The overall outlook on this book is that it was well written, and the irony was unblievable and suspensful.  This novel was written well and like all other Grisham books has a great ending.
6300213714|5.0|What is it about some films? The plot may be simplistic, the acting cardboard, and the cinematography amateurish, but still you love it! The Warriors is just such a flick. This saga of a Coney Island street gang trying to make it home through countless layers of hostile enemies combines action and high tension with a powerful underlying theme. Well worth watching over and over.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is one of the best CDs i've purchased. All of the song are alive and different. Real good bass and good all around audio sound. This currently one of my favorite CDs. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
B00005QIPH|1.0|The Strokes' songs have four or five chords but might as well have one; they're tightly constructed but might as well not bother; each has its own melody that sounds like one note repeated over and over. I mean, they're good, but they're very monochromatic. Are people really so hungry for a Real Rock Band that they actually feel the Excitement! they claim? Or is it just an Oasis autohype thing? <br />Michaelangelo Matos <BR>Manhattan
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is my very favorite movie!!  If you appreciate good music and musicals, you will love this movie!  It is a very creative video.  The chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is amazing!  You have to see this movie!
B0000062FJ|5.0|This is another great gem out 1969, the year of rock. The very first Santana album could possibly be their best. This album, even though it doesn't have classics like \\"Oye Como Va\\" and \\"Black Magic Woman,\\" still is a keeper. Carlos rips out some amazing leads, and the rythym section is incredible. There are 2 conga players and a drummer. Gregg Rolie sings on most of the non-instrumental tracks(He later formed Journey with Neil Schon, who was also in Santana). The best tracks would have to be \\"Waiting,\\" \\"Evil Ways,\\" \\"Treat\\" and the classic from Woodstock, \\"Soul Sacrafice.\\" This band takes jam band to a whole new level. Very good debut.
0743204018|5.0|Speaking to the heart of things Irish, the works of Frank McCourt will touch your soul. I have actually read both works twice, and laughed and cried again with each read.. From the eyes of young Frankie McCourt we see every human emotion, from love to fear to loathing , to the light in a child's eyes when he discovers reading and the power of words and an education. One can only wonder how anyone survived such poverty and emotional scars as the McCourts surely must have felt being raised by their parents. The language of these wonderful works is unmistakenly Irish, and is a classic example of what the Irish do best!!!
B000001DZM|5.0|It's true.  For all the earlier reviewers bashing this CD for having disco (gasp!), get over yourselves.  Honestly, this is a fun CD that also is suprisingly well-balanced.  Sure you get some disco classics, like Go West, SHake Your Groove Thing and I Will Survive.  However, you also get Take a Letter maria, and I Don't Care if the Sun Don't Shine, to name a few.  This CD is not meant to be some grand, serious affair.  It's fun music that backed up a great movie.  Relax, it's okay to love it!
B000009ROK|5.0|a great collection of romantic beautifully produced material. 3 cds - all great and at a great price. highly recommended and crack the wine.
B00005OM4N|3.0|...i purchased the cd long ago when it came out and im still listening to it.  I am a fan of many different music genres...although its all music to me...and i can appreciate dumb fun.  Thats exactly what this kind of music is for, dumb unadulterated fun.  THe songs are very catchy and very dancable and i cant help but shake my groove thing while i listen to it.  My favorite songs out of the albume are \\"im a slave...\\", \\"boys\\" and \\"anticipating\\"...kinda reminds me of Janet back in the day.  While Britney may not have the best voice out there, she has an ok voice to carry the songs she does have...and thats ok with me.  I gave the cd 3 stars because it isnt great music, or even an attempt at great music...its just pure fun and ...you can join the rest of us across the globe dancing to britney and we can all sing along and say \\"Hit us britney...one more time.\\"
0441008615|5.0|I'm a huge fan of both Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, and this book definitely combines the best of both worlds. By both worlds, I mean Neil Gaiman's ability to make even a somewhat simple story seem twisted(in a definitely GOOD way) and Terry Pratchett's ability to write very intelligent and yet, extremely, extremely funny books.
B00005N9CV|3.0|I understand why so many of this album's admirers have passionately defended Diana Krall's freedom to style her music and albums according to her own taste, yet I CANNOT deny that \\"The Look of Love\\" had disappointed my expectations. It is a stylistic departure from her previous albums, and IMO, it is not a good one. <br />Now, I am not a classical jazz purist/critic, so my argument is not that she is \\"selling out\\" or whatsoever. My main complaint is the monotonous musical arrangement of the entire album. Compared to Krall's magnum opus \\"When I Look in Your Eyes\\", there is so little variety of pace and musical colour here. The songs all share the same dreary, slow plodding tempo, and coupled with that lush, slightly muzaky orchestral background, this disc is mainly valuable only as wallpaper accompaniment for a long hibernation in the bathtub, or a long languorous smooch-fest in the bed. I'd guess this IS its main purpose for being. If you are looking for a Krall CD which thrills you with stylish piano-playing, toe-tapping rhythmic verve and witty vocal delivery, \\"When I Look in Your Eyes\\" or \\"Love Scenes\\" is the better bet.<br />Also, not helping this album in my assessment is its noticeable sloppy production values. What were the engineers thinking? I own a top-notch stereo system and all the past Krall CDs have sounded absolutely gorgeous - pure, crisp and crystalline - on it. In comparison, the sound balance of this CD is HORRENDOUS. Whatever instrumental/string/vocal textures there were, they are glazed over by an odd, murky sonic cloud --- almost as if Krall and band are performing for you from behind a curtain of toilet-tissue. S'Mushy! Not helping either is that closed-in, coffin-like boxy atmosphere --- which gives the effect that the album is in mono, not stereo sound. I wonder if this was intentional...?  <br />Anyway, S'Wonderful, Besame Mucho are the best tracks on this album. In all, this album remains a must-hear for Diana Krall fans because her glorious voice is still very much in evidence here - despite the glaring faults. As for the musical accompaniments, hmm, I pray that she returns to her roots for her next album.
0515125024|4.0|for his second outing.  Child's first novel about the anti-hero, Reacher, \\"The Killing Floor\\", was complex and compelling; and hard to put down.  Some of his narrative was definitely the work of a \\"first-time\\" author.  I looked forward to reading about Reacher in series, assuming the plots would stay action-packed, and the writing would improve.<br />\\"Die Trying\\", the sequel, does not disappoint.  It is a fast-paced read sketched out along the same lines as Child's first novel, but in a \\"Montana militia\\" setting.  Child's writing style, unfortunately, has not improved.  He mimics the contrivances of the first novel:  coincidental involvement of Reacher in a major crime, the necessary female entanglement, the incredible string of violence that finally leads up to Reacher being able to exit to continue his poor man's tour around the country.  That's OK, but there is also a ton of repetitive writing - from the detailed description of every weapon Reacher touches or sees in the book, to the numerous times his captors should have done him in, only to see him elude them, but ultimately lose his freedom (but not his life) instead.  Child is also guilty of having his characters repeat phrases over and over, and this appears to be a problem of bad editing.<br />Despite these broad areas of criticism, I gotta admit that its incredibly hard to put a Jack Reacher novel down.  Reacher is resourceful and the author succeeds in capturing your attention with every twist of plot.<br />So...on to Tripwire, the 3rd in the series!
B000005AYM|5.0|Erykah Badu is a very gifted &amp; talented singer, songwriter and actress. Her soothing blends of old-school jazz &amp; soul influences create an amazing backdrop of seductive beats, and a distinctive vocal style. With a musical approach that contains highly mature lyrics, Badu scats her way through an album of masterpieces.<br />From the opening &quot;Rimshot Intro&quot; all the way to the closing &quot;Rimshot Outro&quot;, Badu offers us an in depth look into her wonderful life filled with poetic visions and respected insights. &quot;On &amp; On&quot; is a treasure, as is the hip-hop influenced &quot;Apple Tree&quot;.  &quot;Otherside of the Game&quot; is silky smooth and my personal favorite track &quot;Next Lifetime&quot; is a tale of reincarnated love.<br />Though some found &quot;Afro&quot; humarious, it carried a very distinct message, that Badu plays nobodys fool. Other sure fire favorites include \\"Certainly\\", \\"Four Leaf Clover\\", \\"Drama\\" and \\"Sometimes\\".<br />The lyrical content varies from track to track, and its nice to hear Badu's unique style of blended music put together onto one terrific album.  She is definetly gifted and I hope that all her releases leave me as happy as this one in the future.
B00003CXFG|5.0|Wow some of the bad reviews for this movie need to settle down.  There are far worse movies than this.  I think they accomplished their objective...it was entertaining and fun..at least i thought so.  Not every movie need to be citizen kane.  Just sit back and relax and watch vin diesel in his tank top...I gave it two screenings in the same day just for that.
0790744759|4.0|When I was a littleGal, my folks had a collection of Decca 45s which we would all play from time to time, and the best of the whole lot was Judy Garland's bouncy \\"Trolley Song\\". In fact, that was why I was so interested in seeing \\"Meet Me in St. Louis\\" in the first place when I first did, years ago, to see the film where that happy song comes from.<br />While I can understand exactly why so many people just love \\"Meet Me in St. Louis\\", I must confess I am not really one of the company. Why so? Well, there are two main reasons. One is Margaret O'Brien. I have never liked this cloying child actress; I think she's obnoxious. So when there was a whole episode in the movie featuring her at Halloween time, I just about lost my mind! So much for her. The second reason has to do with regional pride. The plot focuses on how this St. Louis family will have to be relocating to New York City because that's where dad Leon Ames is being promoted to. This idea is reviled by the entire rest of the family, who continually despair of having to live in a tenement in Manhattan. Well, as a lifelong resident of New York City, I was insulted by this attitude. First of all, people who had the money that this family did would not be living in a tenement, so that's just an ignorant idea. Second, well...I guess I have no clearly formed second reason except that it's insulting to hear your hometown run down over and over with no defense! Who wants these people in New York anyway? We already have the \\"Life with Father\\" cast and they're happy to be in a well-appointed brownstone. <br />Now that this is off my chest, I can say a little more about what is GOOD in this movie. The parents Leon Ames and Mary Astor are great, as is old granddad, GWTW's Dr. Meade. Judy and her sisters wear lovely costumes that aren't really accurate, but that's okay with me. But \\"Meet Me in St. Louis\\" is mostly great for its score, a mixture of vintage pieces like \\"Under the Bamboo Tree\\" and original compositions like\\"The Boy Next Door\\". And of course, it certainly helps if the gal singing the score is Judy Garland, MGM's #1 female entertainer. By turns funny and winsome, Judy brings a freshness and vitality to this role that stands tall among her acheivements. It probably helped that she and director Vincente Minnellli were falling in love during the shooting and married soon after.<br />So, \\"Meet Me in St. Louis\\" is a classic Metro musical--I would just like to lighten up on the NYC trashing and jettison the brat. But that's my personal preference; I'm sure most everybody else will absolutely love it.
0446525537|4.0|This book is about a girl named Jamie Sullivan and a guy named Landon Carter. Jamie is a type of girl that is made fun of by the people at school for the way she acts and dresses. She eyes a pastor's daughter and takes her Bible with her everywhere. Landon asks Jamie to the dance because everyone else was taken. He was the school president and needed a date. After the dance Jamie asked Landon to play a part in the Christmas play. Landon is made fun of by his friends or hanging out with a loser. Jamie and Landon start hanging out more and fall in love...<BR>I liked this book very much because this happens to some teens and its very realistic. This book is very fun and exciting you just cant put the book down. It is a very cute love story between two different teens. But some parts are very predictable. If you read this book I bet you would enjoy it very much. <BR>My favorite part of this book was when Landon told Jamie that he loved her. I also loved the part when Landon thinks of marrying Jamie, asked her, and she said yes...
B000062XFG|5.0|Season 2 of Star Trek: The Next Generation improves on the first series by introducing occasionally stronger character based shows and situations. While Tasha Yar is missed, and to a lesser extent Doctor Crusher, we're introduced to 2 new characters. Dr. Pulaski and Guinan. Personally I always enjoyed Pulaski shows, she was one of the only characters that brought a bit of conflict into the programme. There was never enough coming and going of new blood into the Star Trek series (either in front or behind the camera). Guinan (and the new location for her \\"Ten Forward\\" - a great setting for comedy/social moments) added more life and mystery into the show. It was a shame she wasn't able to appear in more episodes in the later parts of the series (she does have a cameo role in Star Trek Nemesis).<br />The episodes themselves were extremely varied. Due to the writer's strike, the season was cut short to 22 episodes rather than the full 26 ending with the appalling \\"bottle show\\", 'Shades of Grey' (Plot summary: Riker in a coma and Deanna \\"looking worried\\" while Pulaski puts copious L.E.Ds on his forehead). \\"The Royale\\" was also truly terrible. There were some storming episodes though, the best being \\"Q Who.\\" This episode had everything: Q, the introduction of the Borg, Guinan, great special effects and a superb score by Ron Jones. Other great episodes were \\"Contagion\\" and \\"Time Squared\\"<br />This box set has everything you could wish for (that's why I'm giving it 5 stars): remastered picture and Dolby Digital sound, one hour of new interviews and documentaries, and some really awesome DVD menus. Although seasons 1 and 2 aren't the best you can't really miss these, they are great foundation episodes with the DVD box sets given the care and attention they deserve.<br />Episode list:<BR>The Child<BR>Where Silence Has Lease<BR>Elementary, Dear Data<BR>The Outrageous Okona<BR>Loud as a Whisper<BR>The Schizoid Man<BR>Unnatural Selection<BR>A Matter of Honor<BR>The Measure of aMan<BR>The Dauphin<BR>Contagion<BR>The Royale<BR>Time Squared<BR>The Icarus Factor<BR>Pen Pals<BR>Q Who?<BR>Samaritan Snare<BR>Up The Long Ladder<BR>Manhunt<BR>The Emissary<BR>Peak Performance<BR>Shades of Gray
0876304420|5.0|If you want to learn about Ericksonian hypnosis this is a must have. It covers major important skills that a hypnotherapist should have. most books out there justgive you techniques after techniques but this one does more, sharing the inside states, attitudes, beliefs a therapist should have. People just don't understand that it's not knowing the techniques that makes a great therapist but it's more of the characteristic and personality of the therapist that makes the techniques work. the same applies with all fields of interactional service. you will learn about flexibility and treat each client anew base on their needs and to be in the moment with the client and not recite scripted inductions like most schools teach you. this books sure is worth getting if you are seriously into hypnotherapy. It covers so much more important areas for a hypnotherapist that isn't emphasized in most schools. you'll learn more about being a hypnotherapist from this book then from any other book. Another cool thing about this book is that stephen is a great writer who is clear,concise and organized, not fluffy. i've gotten books from great hypnotherapist but was very dissapointed because they couldn't write. stephen isn't one of them. you can tell he cares about people learning about hypnosis and he don't hold back like most people.
B00005U8EM|4.0|Great Movie, Great Story, Great Picture, Great Acting, Great Directing, but I have just one problem with this DVD, &quot;NO DTS&quot; what happened here the packaging clearly states &quot;DTS 5.1&quot; or do I need glasses. <br />Brian, Philadelphia, PA.
B000002A3T|3.0|The Division Bell.  It's hard not to like this album. After the very disappointing Momentary Lapse of Reason, there wasn't a person who thought Gilmour and the rest of Pink Floyd could come back with anythig respectable.  Well, they came back with an album that will impress most Floyd fans, but won't blow their minds.<br />Unfortunately the feel that I get from this album is one of a band trying to please all audiences, something that the Roger Waters' headed Pink Floyd never cared about.  &quot;Take It Back&quot; makes this very clear.  It tries to follow in wake of &quot;Learning To Fly&quot; in terms of the very 80's-like, corny, played out concepts.  However, &quot;Learning To Fly&quot; was a great song; &quot;Take It Back&quot; just sounds like an attempt to commercialize Pink Floyd in the 90's.<br />The times when Pink Floyd goes back to its roots are the best moments of this album.  They didn't totally abandon all the experimental sounds and noises that made Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall timeless classics.  &quot;High Hopes&quot; takes us back those days.  The distant chimes in the distance and the ringing bells, combined with some of Gilmour's best lyrics not only make this the best song on the album, but one of the best Pink Floyd songs ever.<br />While 3 stars may seem a little harsh,  it really doesn't deserve any more.  What made Pink Floyd's albums so spectacular throughout the Water's years was their consistency.  Each album had a common theme, which the Division Bell lacks.  It's not to say this is a bad album, because it's far from it.  However, while not half as bad as Momentary Lapse of Reason, it seems once again that Gilmour doesn't know where to take this band.  It's a very good effort, but once again falls well short of the standards that Floydians have come to expect over the years.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I think enough people already gave a movie premise (brother and sister drive home from college and sees a demon). <br />This movie does the job, it scares the hell out of you but i couldn't give it 5 stars because of the small holes.<br />I know the writer/director wanted to stick to the basics but we as an audience have grown use to origins of the killer. Why does he kill? Where did he come from? How can you kill him? This movie doesn't say at all. <br />But the most damaging parts in the movie was the dumb mistakes that the 2 main characters made. People in the theater literally couldn't take it anymore and started to leave. Me, i stayed because the monster in the movie is the coolest i've seen since Freddy Krueger. Not to spoil the movie but, one of the dumb mistakes was: the brother and sister are riding in the car as a police officer escorts them out of town, the \\"Creeper\\" lands on top of the police car and slices his head off. When the 2 main characters see the severed head they stop and check to see if the officer is alive. At this point i'm like \\"DRIVE AWAY IDIOT\\" then the \\"Creeper gets out of the car, grabs the severed head and eats the tongue. While all of this is going on, THEY STILL STAND THERE?!!!?<br />Love the fact that it's brother and sister instead of boyfriend, girlfriend. Also i love that the female character is the strong one while the male lead is the sensitive one. How original.
B00005ATQE|5.0|Directed by Stanley Kubrick, this 1987 film packs a terrific wallop as it follows the dehumanization of marine recruits as they are first prepared for Vietnam and later sent there.  As in other Kubrick films which deal with the dark side of human nature, there's a voice-over narrator and some extreme closeups, particular one called \\"the glare\\" in which a character tilts his head slightly down with his eyes looking up.  The title itself  refers to a shell casing, a metaphor for the tough hollow fighters that these men will eventually turn into.  And from the first scene, which is that of an off-camera barber shaving the heads of the recruits, we see their depersonalization as their hair, which once made them unique individuals, is shaved off.<br />Boot camp takes up more than half of the film, with R. Lee Emery, a former marine sergeant himself, cast in the role of the drill sergeant.  His creativity in insults and curses is amazing as he prods the weak spots of the men under his command, especially the chubby misfit he labels \\"Private Gomer Pyle\\", played brilliantly by Vincent D'Onofrio who won a Golden Globe award for his performance.  Aggression is glorified, with serial killers used as examples of excellent marksmanship as the men are taught to worship their rifles, which they treat as objects of love and recite scripted allegiances to them.  It's not surprising when this training results in an act of violence.<br />The scenes that follow in Vietnam are not as strong as the earlier ones, but clearly show how the training both saves the men's lives and dehumanizes them.  Short, episodic scenes set the stage for the final one, where we see the men have come full circle from the recruits they used to be.  And when they are finished with the battle, war weary and left with the visions of some hard choices they have had to make, they march back to base singing a popular child's song, in which they spell out the words \\"Mickey Mouse\\" to a familiar tune.  The resulting effect is chilling.<br />The video moved fast, holding my attention in an iron grip.  I was fascinated and horrified and couldn't keep my eyes off the screen as it bolted along.  I felt the agony of the boot camp experience, especially for the misfit, and the horror of Vietnam, including what it must have been like for the Vietnamese.  The film made a statement about inhumanity loud and strong.  Clearly, it was one of the best war films I've ever seen.  The violence is real, both physically and mentally.  Highly recommended, but be prepared for discomfort.ffect is chilling.<br />The video moved fast, holding my attention in an iron grip.

B00005QZWJ|5.0|I liked the movie a lot, and the music also. I am a big fan of Enya, she has a wonderful voice. Her voice has managed to make a real romantic atmosphere in the scene with Arwen and Aragorn in Rivendell. I listen the music while I'm reading Tolkien's books, it makes me feel like I am realy in Middle - earth, living with the Elves, the Hobbits, the Wizards...
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is a fantastic new musician on the college/indie rock scene. His cd is one of the few I can listen to in its entirety and still want to hear again. His concerts are incredible, he is down to earth and real, just like his music. Any music fan can find something of John's they enjoy. He has great style, soul, and is a brilliant songwriter. You have to try him out, you will not be disappointed!
B00005JKJA|5.0|It's Oscar nomination time again and I noticed that Hollywood's insiders have only given a passing nod to David Lynch's \\"Mullholland Drive\\", by only nominating him as Best Director (which we all know he won't win). I saw \\"Mullholland Drive\\" several months ago and I'm still haunted by it's images, long after the tearjerking senimentality of \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" and high the tech overkill of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" have dissipated. We live in a world where the transparent charm of Julia Roberts passes as \\"Best Actress\\"; and both Laura Harring and Naomi Watts don't even get nominated. Come on guys!...you could have given at least one of them a best actress nomination. David Lynch, the most daring director since Louis Bunuel, gets passed over again. I have a feeling David Lynch could care less, but I do.
B00004Z459|3.0|The CD Hybrid Theory by LP, their debut, isn't as original as people claim of it to be. They have music that's too easy to catch audiences, and are kind of like boy band metal. There are good and bad songs on this CD.<br />The high points are the memorable &quot;Points of Authority&quot;, mainly because I like the guitar riffs in the post-chorus. &quot;In the End&quot; was good, but now it's overplayed. However, &quot;Papercut&quot;, the album's first song is pretty enjoyable. Some songs tend to sound alike, and they use techno in the same sense of affects as KoRn did on Issues. However, everyone acts as if it's how nu-metal should be. It already existed before Limp Bizkit, whether you like it or not.
0452282152|5.0|This book was amazing. Chevalier's description was amazing, adding color to the story. She truly put her imagination into it. She expressed the personalities of other characters through Griet's thoughts, but not too much or too obviously. There aren't any words enough to describe how great this book was. You simply have got to read it.
B00000I1OY|5.0|i totally thought that biodome was the most excellent movie, but that was until i rented the swimmer. i gotta give props to burt lancaster! he rocks! the experience was life changing. once as a younger man i tried to swim across my own pool and was sadly defeated and to think that this dude made it across ten. like whoa! swimming is not easy. that part where the llama comes out of nowhere and chases him, that was so intense, i was so scared. luckily for him that chinchilla was around to save the day. the way the blood poured out of that llama, not for those with weak stomachs. that's not even the best part, but if you want to know the rest rent the movie. two tumbs way up. quality entertainment. love and peace out.
B000002UA9|4.0|The Beatles have been so extensively studied and analyzed that it is easy to forget that listening to the fab four can be pretty darned fun and no Beatles disc is more fun than their excellent 1963 debut, Please Please Me, probably because it was recorded during a time when fun was king in popular music. Please Please Me is a fine example the rock and roll of malt shops and hoola hoops, when what you said was less important than the zest and energy with which you said it. Surely in its latter form, rock music was much more timeless and important an art form (thanks in a large part to the creative expansion of the Beatles themselves), but there is still something about clever, melodic pieces of ear-candy like \\"I Saw Her Standing There,\\" \\"Chains,\\" \\"Baby It's You\\" or \\"Love Me Do\\" (which is given a nice, breezy feel by John Lennon's long-forgotten harmonica abilities) that get one's feet moving and feelings high. Sure, the White Album and Abbey Road stand up to twenty-first century standards better, but when cruising in the car on a spring night, there are few records that satisfy as well as Please Please Me.
091581112X|5.0|Sanaya has an extremely unique talent of writing with a timelessness that makes her material fresh and alive each time you read it.  This material comes through at a very high vibrational level and reaches right to the heart of issues I have seen unfold in my life and in the lives of others.  These messages from Orin are powerful and extremely basic. Sanaya/Orin has a clarity that allows you easily absorb the truth behind what is being said.  No mumbo jumbo here.  Good stuff!   This is a book you can read and re-read with tremendous benefit.  When you read this material, you have the sense that Sanaya/Orin is truly connected to spirit at a high level.  It is well worth reading.  - Mark Greenia, author of &quot;Energy Dynamics: Conscious Human Evolution.&quot;

0553213105|4.0|Pride and Prejudice: a probing study of human nature or just another love story?  Jane Austen's novel enables the reader to embark on a journey with moments of laughter, suspense, frustration, and delight.  Although Pride and Prejudice may seem like a love story on a superficial level, a deeper look reveals the complex themes of reputation, class, stereotypes, and first impressions.<BR> Exploring characters from different walks of life, Jane Austen effectively and passionately develops the personas of her characters, enrapturing the reader.  First impressions can be dangerous and the author implies that society must discard preconceived notions and, in turn, explore beyond the surface.  Elizabeth Bennett, the novel's protagonist, captivates the reader with her independent, free-spirited, and quick-witted nature.  An anomaly of her time, Lizzy refuses to marry solely for status, for love is essential and she will not compromise her values for power and wealth.  Her character is refreshing as compared to her marriage-obsessed mother, materialistic and pedantic sisters, and pompous aristocrats.  However, no matter how much the reader hates these characters, he or she realizes that Austen has accomplished her goal of exposing these diverse individuals for who they truly are.    <BR> The development of relationships and the characters themselves also enthrall the reader.  First appearing as a pompous snob, Darcy initially repulses the reader, but through the progression of the novel, the reader begins to see Darcy as the kind, generous man that he is.  On the other hand, Wickham appears to be the helpless victim of Darcy, but this false impression is quickly erased.  Appearance versus reality is a reoccurring theme throughout the novel which forces the reader to resist deception and search for truth.<BR> The reader laughs with Mr. Bennett, cringes at Mrs. Bennet, sympathizes with Jane, flinches at the haughty remarks of Caroline Bingley, and wants to knock some sense into immature Lydia.  The strength of the story lies in Austen's depiction of love as an element that can surmount class boundaries.  Taken through twists and turns, the reader experiences love ignited, love broken, and love rekindled.  But is this is a typical love story?  Although Pride and Prejudice ends like a typical enchanted love story, Austen's development of the characters, storyline, and her shattering of class shackles enables the reader to acknowledge that the story serves a deeper purpose.

B000002GWJ|4.0|Blue Valentine is another high-quality Tom Waits album from the 70's, and one where he started to mix it up a little. On it, he got rid of the strings for the most part, and brought in a little more electric guitar and instrumentation. Also, he started to broaden his subject matter a bit more at this point. He'd temporarily given up his seat at the bar in favor of singing about... alligator purses, backwards cross-country trips, lunatic street characters, and bizzare Valentine's day imagery. Just because he'd given up his barstool philosopher's hat (for the time being) didn't mean that his lyrics were any less interesting. Indeed, this is the point where he began to venture out into obscure lyrical esoteria that still no one in popular music has matched, or even dared to tread. Songs such as $29.00, Little Bullet From A Pretty Blue Gun, and, especially, Kentucky Avenue were lyrical freakshows with music to match. Also interesting, and off-kilter, is Waits's version of the song Somewhere from West Side Story. His take on it is good, and interesting. There's really not much else you can say about the album. If you like Tom Wait's 70's music, you'll like this. It's that simple. If you like it, go ahead and gobble up everything from Small Change through Heart Attack & Vine... you'll love 'em all.
B000002IOW|3.0|i think im starting to get it?here is my tale of a rush fan(me):when rush came out i loved them!they were everything i wanted in a band.i loved the music instantly ,with no effort or repeated listens..they matured faster than i did and needed to grow and expand,everything i needed and respected them for eventually drove me away for a while..after signals i started to lose intrest ,gone were the in your face guitars and rock anthems..but now i am finally maturing i feel this album deserves rediscovering.so with my headphones on and presto playing i write this review and i think i am starting to get it!some of my favorite tracks are:show dont tell,superconductor,hand over fist,available light,red tide,overall the cd as a whole is good.so crank it up and enjoy.
B0000025OP|4.0|Although not a great Dylan album on par with say, Blonde On Blonde, Highway 61, and Blood On The Tracks, Planet Waves is nonetheless a very good album that I enjoy a lot. The album as a whole has a very relaxed, laid-back, domestic atmosphere about it - much like New Morning, but this is a far superior album. Though there isn't an absolute standout, all-time classic song on here, there is a general good quality, and several rise to the level of very good. On A Night Like This, You Angel You, and a few others are very good, enjoyable songs. Dirge is a very, very good song - Dylan's best put-down song since Positively Fourth Street, and a very heartfelt message, with a suitably moving vocal. Wedding Song is a beautiful love song. It's one of his best, and vastly underrated and almost never mentioned. The lyrics are immaculate, touching, and Dylan's vocal really puts it across. And, of course, Forever Young is one of his most enduring classics. I must say, though, that having two versions on here of it is totally unnecessary. The first version is far superior to the second, totally beautiful; and the second is far inferior and unnecessary. It does have a few nice things about it that the first version doesn't have, but that just means that, like most cases of having two versions of one song, it would've been better to consolidate the two into one version, combining the best parts of each. The album is just really nice as a whole. I've never been a big fan of The Band with Dylan (always liked them on their own), and always thought that Robbie Robertson's guitar style was rather limited, but I must admit they do a great job here - much better than on The Basement Tapes. Going, Going, Gone contains one of his most beautiful and expressive guitar solos. Dylan's vocals on this album are also among his best. I've heard a lot of people not that his vocals are to be found on this album, and you can definately see where that's coming from. A very nice album. It doesn't sound anything like The Basement Tapes; it sounds fairly reminiscent of New Morning, but is a lot better. I would call this among the best of the second tier of Dylan albums - a must for the fan.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie... This movie definitely has a new concept, and the filming...wow...the filming is absolutely incredible.  It does move at a fast pace, but this is just to keep the viewer on their toes. I loved the music (with the exception of the pop princess' song \\"lady marmalade\\").  I never knew Ewan or Nicolle had such beautiful voices.  Oh...they are so gorgeous together.  They are also both so talented.  This movie is a whirlwind of emotions.  It is well worth it though. I wish I could give it so many more stars, for I believe it deserves 10!! It's a great movie, with a great plot, a great ending, a great twist, great actors, great music, wow, i could go on forever! You can tell I enjoyed it!! This has probably got to be one of my favorite movies.  It's wonderful, or actually, it's SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR!!!!!  I urge you to see it.  It's a beautiful movie, with beautiful actors and of course the cutie-Ewan McGregor!!!!
B00005NWM3|5.0|3 Doors Down-The Better Life. Nine Days-The Madding Crowd. Creed-Human Clay and Weathered. These are some examples of CDs that I have taken chances with. In 3 Doors Down's case, I had only heard \\"Kryptonite\\" and \\"Loser\\" when I bought it. I loved it. In Nine Days' case, when I got it for Christmas, I had only heard \\"Absolutely (Story Of A Girl)\\" and \\"If I Am.\\" I loved it. In Creed's case, I had only heard \\"Higher,\\" \\"With Arms Wide Open,\\" and \\"Are You Ready?\\" from Human Clay and only \\"My Sacrifice\\" from Weathered. I loved both of 'em. I have tooken many chances in buying CDs, and when I got Nickelback's Silver Side Up from Columbia House, I had only heard \\"How You Remind Me,\\" \\"Too Bad,\\" and another song I didn't know. The case was the same I loved it. \\"Never Again\\" is a great grunge song for any Nirvana fan. \\"How You Remind Me\\" is a good, radio-friendly song that you never get tired of. \\"Woke Up This Morning\\" is a song about feeling horrible when you wake up. Need I say more? \\"Too Bad\\" is their second single that is becoming friendly with radio's \\"Two For Tuesday,\\" tagging along with \\"How You Remind Me.\\" \\"Just For\\" is a very upbeat song. \\"Hollywood\\" is one of my favorite songs on the disc. It talks about Hollywood (which any idiot would know). \\"Money Bought\\" may not be the best song, but you can relate to the lyrics. \\"Where Do I Hide\\" is another upbeat song about prisoners. \\"Hangnail\\" is kind of like \\"Money Bought.\\" You can relate to it. \\"Good Times Gone\\" starts off as a very nice, slow song, and then flows into a good, rockin' song. I think anyone who likes Nirvana, Puddle Of Mudd, or Alice In Chains will like this album. Come on, take a chance...
B00004VWAF|5.0|Depending on how you view genius, innovation and all forms of creativity, &quot;On The Corner&quot; will no doubt give you plenty to digest. In my humble estimation, this brilliant work is a logical extension of the work miles began around 1968 when he forever altered the course of modern music by employing the electric guitar of George Benson on &quot;Miles In The Sky&quot;. While some purists still cry fowl at the free form, loose and hypnotic grooves of &quot;On The Corner&quot;, us more musically adventurous people will positively eat this up!  I personally dig the sleigh-bells and sitar that lend &quot;Black Satin&quot; it's rhythmic stomp and texture! &quot;On The Corner&quot; is not an easy album to like, parts of it seem willfully difficult, but it is a remarkable statement by a man who never stopped searching and looking forward.  A Masterpiece.
B00004XQ83|4.0|After seeing the movie I bought this soundtrack for myself, and each of my relatives, (no one was disappointed with their Christmas gift).  For anyone who enjoys the sound of Bluegrass, Gospel, or more traditional Country music this CD is a real pleasure to listen to!
B000002J1S|5.0|This is a must-have for any Genesis lover.  Genesis is fast-paced, heart-wrenching, and downright ethereal in this solid effort, thanks in part to contributions by Brian Eno.  However, one can feel the tensions between the band members when listening to this album.  It is the only album of its kind that Genesis recorded, for A Trick of the Tail harks back to the twelve-string music that established their sound in the early Seventies.  This would also be Peter Gabriel's last album with Genesis.  The song &quot;Fly on a Windshield&quot; can describe Gabriel's feelings concerning whether to leave the group or stick it out.  However, it is a wonderful album to have, although I must confess that no other Genesis album is as good as Wind and Wuthering, my all-time favorite.
B00003CXRM|5.0|My husband and completely enjoyed this film, and found it to be so refreshing and funny that we viewed it twice in the same week!  Not only did we find the story entertaining the soundtrack was a treat in itself.  For those who enjoy traditional Country, Bluegrass, and Gospel music we suggest you see this movie.
B000002J2B|5.0|My favorite Genesis album, without a doubt.  Phil Collins'<BR>singing and percussion work is at its apex, and Tony Banks' <BR>synthesizers put out beautiful arrangements.  But what is the crowning point of this album is the sweet, sad, tear-provoking nylon classical guitar on &quot;Blood on the Rooftops&quot;, played masterfully by Steve Hackett.  His departure from the band (this was his last album with Genesis) marked, for better or for worse, the band's movement toward more accessible, pop-friendly songwriting.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Thank God they have finally released this on DVD.  This is without a doubt the funniest British Sitcom ever.  Every episode is funny. Worth a buy.

B00005QG9J|5.0|while michelle branch's album, &quot;the spirit room,&quot; was an ok excursion to the soft-rock world, i needed more to feel and think about.  i first heard of incubus in the summer of 2000, when &quot;stellar&quot; was going crazy on mtv.  i was inspired, but didn't get their album, &quot;make yourself.&quot; then came spring, 2001; &quot;drive.&quot;  then incubus became the radio-rock band that they AREN'T are; i discovered they were going to release a next album later that year.  i liked &quot;wish you were here;&quot; i really did.  but i didn't get it's home until january.  i won't give comments on the songs, it'll take too long because they are all really well-written and new. <br />1) nice to know you- 10/10<BR>2) circles- 9/10<BR>3) wish you were here- 10/10<BR>4) just a phase- 8.5/10<BR>5) 11 AM- 8/10<BR>6) blood on the ground- 9.5/10<BR>7) mexico- 9/10<BR>8) warning- 10/10 (outstanding song)<BR>9) echo- 9.5/10<BR>10) have you ever- 8.5/10<BR>11) are you in- 9.5/10<BR>12) under my umbrella- 10/10<BR>13) aqueous transmission- 9.5/10<br />so, &quot;warning&quot; is by far the most creative song on this inventive album, sure to live long into 2002.
B000002J1F|5.0|This album is great and is a necessary addition for every<BR>music library.  Yes is one of those classic progressive bands that still live to this day.  Did anyone know that Bill Bruford played for Genesis in concert when Phil Collins first became lead singer?  He was later replaced by Chester Thompson, formerly Frank Zappa's drummer.
0671027573|5.0|THIS BOOK REALLY GOT MY ATTENTION ! MR. PERFECT IS FUNNY,SEXY,THRILLINGLY SCARY AND VERY INTERESTING! I PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE OUTER WORLD WHEN READING IT. I NEVER WANTED THE BOOK TO END SINCE I GOT SO ATTACHED TO THE CHARACTERS AND THE EXCITING PLOT. I RECOMMEND ALL OF YOU TO READ IT SO YOU CAN FIND OUT FOR YOURSELVES!
0140288503|5.0|I found Bowden's approach to researching and documenting this story incredibly refreshing.<br />Such stories are often told by:<br />---commanders attempting to revive or enhance their reputation<br />---soldiers who saw the battle from only their point of view<br />---commentators with a political axe to grind<br />Bowden lets the soldiers tell their tale and he beautifully merges these parts into a coherent whole.<br />Or he tries his best.  I enjoyed the book immensely, but the holes are obvious, though Bowden points them out himself.  Some stories simply can't be told since they contain operational details that must remain classified.  While unfortunate, it's a necessity, and Bowden takes you as close to the classified action as he can without crossing the line.<br />While the book focuses on a single action, the Somalia story has much more to it both before and after the event.  The battle changed the men and the city.  Our forces did not leave quietly.  I would have been very interested in reading more about our actions following this terrible day and leading up to our departure.  Chances are, much of that is classified as well.<br />Bowden also omits, through no fault of his own, the role al Qaeda may have played in arming and training the Somalis for action against the U.S.  Indeed, the Somali order of battle is not well described at all.  I forgive Bowden for this omission simply because these events have hardly relegated themselves to history yet.  The story will take decades to emerge.<br />Finally, the movie and the book remain faithful to each other.  The movie omits details, but does not significantly change the story.  If you want the extra detail, then read the book.  In fact, I recommend clearing your schedule and starting the book late in the afternoon - with no intention of putting it down.  Take your time, read it through the night and into the next day...<br />~ Robert
0553277472|5.0|Read this book.  Talk about it.  Share it with your friends.  This book is more important than one thinks at first glance.  I have read it 5 times over the past 25 years, first as a teenager thinking it was about motorcycles, next as a Philosophy major at Harvard, and each time I have gotten something new out of it.  It is more than a travel adventure.  It is more than a father/son reconciliation story.  It is more than an autobiographical odyssey of psychological redemption.  It is even more than an &quot;inquiry into values.&quot;  This book reveals the greatest crime perpetrated against intellectual history.  While Pirsig is concerned with a synthesis of Eastern and Western philosophical traditions, he points us to the violence done by Plato in his attack on the Sophists.  Until Plato, Philosophy was a part of the common life.  Sophists wandered the Greek world offering instruction (for pay) in rhetoric and Philosophy, and this was deemed the normal course of life.  Even Plato's revered Socrates conducted his discourses in the marketplace, the agora.  The aristocratic and elitist Plato's crime (in my view) was to whisk philosophical discussion away from the agora and put it in the acadamy, where it has remained gathering dust for 25 centuries.  His Theory of Forms tells us that few, if any other than himself, can see things as they &quot;really are.&quot;  The Republic tells us that only the philosopher-king (Plato himself being the leading candidate) is fit to rule.  If all of Philosophy is a &quot;response to Plato&quot; as A.N. Whitehead put it, then we are debating with a traitor to humanity.  Nothing is more relevant than a synthesis of the Philosophical and the Practical ways of being, as well as Eastern and Western ways of thinking.  I have devoted my life to dragging the philosophical debate back from the academy into the agora where it belongs and where it can be of the greatest good to the greatest number of people.  Reading and sharing this book with friends is a wonderful way to begin that pilgrimage yourself.  I just wish someone would make a film of it.  Can't you just see William Hurt in the lead?
0767802659|5.0|Starship Troopers works on many levels.  First, the Sci-Fi is fun and comic book style.  Second, the Action is non-stop and interesting.  Third, Denise Richards.  Fourth, the story is a thinly veiled political farce.  Five, the bugs are great.  And did I mention, Denise Richards?
B00005O3VD|5.0|This Streisand classic is a must for any true fan's collection.  When we think of Barbra Streisand, \\"Funny Girl\\" comes to mind.  I've been looking forward to this film being released on  the dvd format and it is finally here.  The only problem I have with the dvd is that the special features are pretty [bad].  I was hoping there would be a lot more stuff.  That being said, the movie itself is so good that I had to give this dvd five stars.  This is one of my favorite (if not THE favorite) films she has done. I think anyone who buys this film will be glad they did.
B000056K04|5.0|As a fairly new DMB fan, I went out and bought &quot;Everyday&quot; after falling in love with &quot;Crash&quot;  I have also listened to selections from every DMB album.  As I can see how people may be upset at the short, more commercial form of music, I don't think that is what DMB was aiming for.  I still find his lyrics and the musicality of the pieces just as thick and complex as the older songs.  It is different, but I love &quot;Everyday&quot; just as much as the other CD's.  I do agree that maybe DMB success may have contributed to some peoples turn off, but you should love DMB just the same...
6305176299|5.0|The first time I saw this film, I felt like I had been on a fun and breath-taking thrill ride.  From beginning to end, this great action film moves so quickly and so interestingly that you feel like YOU are on that bus.  Keanu Reeves is good as a cop, named Jack Traven, trying to stop a disaster that will kill an unsuspecting busload of people.  Throw in Dennis Hopper as a really good psycho villian and Sandra Bullock as Annie, a young woman who becomes a reluctant hero, and you have the making of the best action film of the 90s.  When I watch this now, I still enjoy the fast pace of Jan DeBont's direction and the chemistry between Keanu and Sandra is charming and real.  This film spawned a sequel---don't bother, it was bad!---stick to the original.  You can't improve on a film like this!
6304994540|5.0|This IS the funniest movie have ever seen in my entire life.  I love movies. I LOVE movies, and this is a funny movie.  Unfortunately, it didn't get much attention at the box office and consequently a lot of people have missed out on this film.<br />I could go into a long explanation about the Dude, nihilists, young money grubbing second wives, strange assistants, crazed Vietnam vets, bowling, and pot smoking, but it would give too much away and it would ruin the movie entirely.  I didn't know anything about it before I saw it and I am so thankful that is the way that I saw it.  I was not prepared for all the twist and turns in this movie, except I knew the Cohen brothers we in on the movie.  So right there you know it is going to be strange, funny and wonderful. Believe me. It is!  Watch it. You won't regret it.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I was sure that such a thing was impossible---a comedy set during the Holocaust and it would be good. Well, it wasn't good...it was GREAT! This lovely little movie is so charming and so sweet, I don't know how anyone could dislike it. I do realize that the star, Roberto Benigni, sometimes is over the top and tends to annoy some people but that is so far from the truth involving this film. We see his character meet a beautiful woman and his attempts to woo her. When they fall in love, marry and have a child, all seems perfect---until World War II and the beginning of the Holocaust. When he is taken, along with his son, to the concentration camps, it is so touching to see the lengths he goes to, as a father, to hide the truth of their actual situation. Roberto Benigni won an Oscar for his role and the film won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Both were well deserved. I highly recommend this film.
0767805712|4.0|A terrific modern, sci-fi adventure that's great to watch and makes you think when it's over. Gattaca, along with The Matrix and Dark City, belong to a new type of science fiction - presenting compelling, disturbing, alternate realities. In the case of Gattaca, however, part of what makes the movie so terrific (aside from Uma Thurman) is the tremendous attention to cinematographic detail that's evident, right down to the neo-futuristic Karmen Ghia-looking car. Definitely some lurking Kubrick influence here. But unlike Kubrick's film, this one doesn't have any of those slow parts or deliberate dialogue. The most suprising part about the movie, when you stop to think about it, is how little sic-fi is actually in it... but don't stop, go out and get this movie. it'll be a terrific addition to the collection.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I bought India Arie's cd after seeing the video for the single &quot;Video&quot;.  While people were going wild about Alicia Keys (who is wonderful, as well), I wondered why no one was paying attention to this talented singer.  Thankfully, with the seven Grammy nominations she received, this deserving talent is getting some recognition.  Her voice reminds me of a little of Whitney Houston's and her sound is a little like Sade but with a twist of originality that makes her unique.  Her music is a nice simple blend of jazz and R &amp; B and this mellow cd is great listening.  If you like the sound of Sade, or Alicia Keys, or just really good music, give this cd a try.
B000000OPW|5.0|siouxsie and the banshees evolved into their 3rd phase of evolution with a remarkably decent lp, with a dose of their former abrasiveness, excellent lyrics, and now more than ever, tuneful singing and playing.

B00003CWL6|5.0|This film is very, very good.  The story slowly strips away the layers that hides the dysfunction of this suburban American family.  While they may look like the perfect family in a nice, big home with good jobs, we see that happiness is the one thing each member lacks.  The complex relationships in this film are so interesting to watch and the mood, both dark and comic, is meshed perfectly.  Kevin Spacey, most definitely, deserved the Oscar he received for this film and the award for &quot;Best Picture&quot; was cinematic justice.  Alan Ball (who created the equally brilliant HBO series, &quot;Six Feet Under) is a genius as far as I'm concerned.  From now on, when his name is mentioned in conjunction with any project, I'm there!

B000002G7G|5.0|that this subdued, mostly acoustic, ethereal record would succeed White Light/White Heat? Im guessing that they felt like they had mined the feedback/shock thing as much as they could(few bands have gone further), and they were also free of customer expectations, because no one liked them. <BR>Anyway, the thing is beautiful. A mix of poetic meditations and should be pop hits, with two very interesting cuts at the end. \\"The Murder Mystery\\" should satisfy those still wanting to hear the Velvets wax experimental. It's a spooky, rumbling 8 minute dirge with two separate stories being told at the same time, one from each speaker, which ends in some great manic piano pounding that should, if you're alive, give you chills. And closing the album is Mo Tucker's gentle \\"Afterhours\\", where she shows off her childlike, off key voice. Touching. She also sings one channel of \\"The Murder Mystery\\", but its kinda scary instead of moving. As I said above, what a polar shift for the group...going from not being able to hit a good vein for shooting up to writing about grace and Jesus Christ. Chew on that for a minute.
0194367959|3.0|There is no doubt that OALD is the best ESL dictionary. The reason for 3 * is that the pronunciations in the CDROM would not work for me and also the links to the PDF files.I am not sure if it is just a problem for me!!

It doesn't matter WHAT you like to read, do you like to read?'.  If they came anywhere near the affirmative in their answer, I'd slam a copy of this book into their hands.<br />If Tom Clancy were cool, this is the best book he'd ever write.<br />Honestly, I read so much, I'm almost never tempted to read anything twice, although there is certainly plenty that is more than worth of repeated reads.  Even so, Stephenson's book was VERY hard not to flip from the last page to the first and start again.<br />It's driving me crazy, but I can find no information online about the state of his follow-up.  Anyone?
B000002U82|5.0|Like many people, &quot;The Wall&quot; was my first P.F. album, considered the classic. I enjoyed it, I listened to it often, and that was it. A few months ago I happened to be at Bird's (a friend of mine) house. He was watching the Wizard of Oz with the volume turned off. Instead he was playing &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;(to do this you must press start after the MGM Lion roars for the 3rd time) What a fool! I exclaimed. Nevertheless, I proceeded to watch the rest of the movie in a deep trance-like state. When it was finished, I watched it twice more. Naturally, I bought the album the next day. The sound is difficult to describe, and yet, simply put, it is fantastic. I will not disrespect the music by describing it with a few superficial adjectives. All I submit is that the words will move you, the music will own you, and if you play it with the Wizard of Oz, it will trip you out bro.
0792156684|5.0|A girl madly in love desperately struggling to save the life of the man whom she loves (which implies: a person struggling to preserve a sacred value, i.e. the person you love)....an old captain walking to his death with a guilty conscience (which implies: a man of honor punishing himself for having betrayed his own, independent judgment)...an engineer who is going down with his greatest achievement, now doomed to destruction, unable to abandon it at any cost (which implies: a man's love for & pain at the loss of the highest symbol of his capacity to think and create)...a mother putting her children(oblivious of their fate)to sleep with a bed time story, fully conscious of the fact that they shall all drown and die in a few minutes (which implies: a mother courageously protecting the magnificent, innocent spirit of (her) children, which has a great confidence in life, which knows no fear or ugliness)....<br />This is what I call emotional intensity - which is nothing but an expression of a value-oriented view of life. Emotions proceed from values-and greater the emotional intensity, greater the role & importance of values in the lives of the people involved.<br />\\"Titanic\\" is not just a passionate love story (though within a somewhat clichéd setup of a rich girl and poor boy). It is about the opening up of the soul of a young, spirited girl disgusted with convention & conformity -desperate to be happy and live her life on her own terms-to the full. And Jack does not become a great lover just because he died for the woman he loved, but because he gave her a more precious gift: the vision of a life filled with joy, laughter and beauty - a life which Rose never knew existed - which gave her the incentive to live to be 101. To live life happily one must love life, to love it one must have a particular view of life - it is this view which Jack gave Rose.<br />\\"Titanic\\" portrays a wide spectrum of human emotions with an amazing force, vividness & effectiveness...passionate love & obsessive jealousy, frustration & depression, youthful exuberance & a sense of flight, fear & courage, yearning & despair, cruelty & horror. Whether it be a 100-year old woman recounting the most romantic moments of her life to a group of youngsters of the age of her grandchildren or an old couple who chose to die together rather than chose one's own life & the other's death - each emotion has a depth, intensity and sense of drama which radiates a warmth that has touched millions of hearts around the world and makes the viewer one with the characters in their feelings. In this depiction of human joy and suffering against the backdrop of one of the most heartrending tragedies of our times, combined with an overpowering suspense & adventure, lies the universal appeal of \\"Titanic\\"<br />Apart from the visual effects & background score which are marvelous, I loved the artistry & execution of various scenes. About the \\"lewd\\", `painting' scene (which I think was poetic), I'd say: I'm thankful to Kate Winslet - it was like getting a glimpse of paradise. As for the `car' scene: it was presented in a manner which conveyed sensuality, passion & tenderness - without the crudeness of the usual love-making scenes. The \\"finger\\" simply expresses free-spiritedness & a childish mischievousness properly directed towards an undeniably obnoxious man. (Rose never shows irreverence towards those who really deserve respect).The comedy is subtle, delightful & witty - never vulgar or offensive.In addition, the performances were very good - I particularly liked that of Kate Winslet.<br />My favorite scenes are-the \\"flying\\" scene; the one in which the half-broken ship stands perpendicular on the waters for a few moments & then slowly starts sinking- I've yet to see anything to match them in all cinema (in terms of the emotions they evoke, their dramatic effect, grandeur & artistry) and the scene in which Rose leaves her lifeboat & returns to Jack (dramatizing the intensity of her passion).<br />In short, \\"Titanic\\" is one of the best films I've ever seen and hope to see. I'd undoubtedly call it one of my favorite films.

B00005LMBK|4.0|By no means should anyone just run out and get this album unless he or she is extremely eclectic in musical tastes and horrendously open-minded.  However, this seemingly nonsensical plethora of beats and tunes was masterfully put together in an apparently random whim!  Funky, trippy, and fun, Gorillaz somehow accomplished what Nirvana did around a decade ago.<br />The most obvious talent a listener would find familiar is the singing of Blur's Damon Albarn.  One might say he'd been freed from Blur and had the chance to go out and have a little fun.  His play on singing is most evident in Clint Eastwood's lazy refrain which can be irritating at first but may ultimately become intoxicating.<br />This album just has something for everyone.  There are catchy pop tunes like 19-2000 and old-school rap (thanks to Del the Funky Homosapien) given a modern background like Clint Eastwood and Rock The House.  Surprisingly outstanding are the funky downtempo trip-hoppish songs like Tomorrow Comes Today and New Genious.  And there's a couple of rock songs (Punk, 5/4)!  All of which (aside from a few songs that can only be appreciated under chemical infulence) are moderately good to excellent.<br />So, if you can stomach some songs you just aren't used to (but may end up liking) you'll find a home somewhere in the album and maybe, just maybe find some interesting new neighbors.

B00000I3JO|5.0|...Hats is my favourite album of all time too. There is so much beauty in its melancholia that though good with words I find it so difficult to do it justice to the reader. 'Let's go out tonight' and 'From a late night train' are the high points for me...there are thankfully no 'let's gee it up' fast tracks......it would have been like the Pope suddenly bursting in to song ! My other favourite albums are Joni Mtchell's Blue and Heija, and more recently, David Gray's White Ladder. The million million million seller, White Ladder, is superb but take it from us, for sheer haunting musical mastery that grabs you at the throat and forces a tear or two (if you're in the mood) it really is no match. I too bought it on cassette when it was first released and I remember it having to be THE album to play when I first drove my shiney white Corrolla GTI....I was thankfully over GTIs long ago but never this album. Buy it or miss out on life.
B0000026NC|3.0|Ah a live Pink Floyd album. Talk about riding the gravy train!. At least P.U.L.S.E has the excuse of a full live performance of Dark Side to justify it's exsistence. This one however doesn't.<br />Now, Don't get me wrong. This is a reasonable enough live album. But when it's bad it's REALLY bad.<br />The Good - Time, One Of These Days, Sorrow, Comfortably Numb, On The Turning Away.<br />The Average - Dogs of War (a VAST improvement on it's studio counterpart), Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Wish You Were Here, Yet Another Movie/Around And Around, Us And Them.<br />The Ugly - Another Brick In The Wall Part 2, Run Like Hell, Money, Learning To Fly<br />Also sadly missing are the excellent renditions of Welcome To The Machine, Signs Of Life and One Slip which the band performed on the tour.<br />If you want to hear the BEST ever renditions of Time and One Of These Days then buy it. If you're looking for a live Pink Floyd album then I'd advise you to go with the far superior P.U.L.S.E.
0375507507|5.0|From the wonderful cover to the last page, this book soars and roars with one hundred percent engagement with life.  I'm finding the &quot;one star&quot; comments awfully arid.  They seem to be desperate attempts to assert that life is orderly, consistent, and morally unambiguous.<br />I think to see this book only in terms of colonialism or racism is too narrow.  Yes, these are central facts of the lives portrayed, and we see the costs they exact from all those involved.  However, we also see how often basic humanity moves beyond the barriers the &quot;isms&quot; create.<br />I've read many books about Africa, but this one, better than others, conveys the &quot;senses awake&quot; vitality that makes it so hard for people who have lived there to feel as alive anywhere else.<br />Most of all, though, this is about an incredible family that can't be kept down, can't be divided, can't keep their mouths shut, and can't be forgotten.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Well, call me out of touch or over the hill or whatever, but the 'hype' that other reviewers refer to completely passed me by. I bought this on the strength of a recommendation from a friend whose taste in music I trust... and that trust has been rewarded. Yes this ex NME reading almost 40 yr old has nothing to complain about here, hype or no hype. True, this band arent the answer to anything. As everyone else has pointed out, derivative is probably a kind way of putting their resemblance to every other great 'Noo Yawk' band of the last 30 years (The Velvets, Television, Johnny Thunders Heartbreakers, not to mention Detroits own Iggy &amp; the Stooges), but the songs on this album are so strong and well constructed they'll withstand any comparisons, hype and resultant world weary cynicism. Basically, these guys write great songs and they Rock... forget the hype, listen to the music. <br />By the way, to the reviewer from the great state of California, just because the NME says something is cool doesnt necessarily mean it's pants. Sure NME writers are not the kind of people you'd want to share a planet with, but if they're raving about these guys (I haven't read the rag for 15 yrs) they've got something right. What the hell are you worrying about the NME for in CA anyway ? Is this an East Coast - West Coast thing ?
0345409671|5.0|This is an awesome continuation of the Vampire Chronicles.  Anne's imagery and utter emotion are astounding, you can actually imagine yourself in Lestat's place.  It's topic is controvertial, but what's the point of free speech and thinking if you can't have some little bit of controvercy?  The book covers the age old conflict God vs. Memnoch (I have put memnoch in place of devil, because I just don't like the word devil.  It's too vulgar), good vs. bad, truth vs. lies.  I loved the book.  And if you're a true lover of the Vampire Chronicles, you'll pick up the book anyway you can because I know you'll love it too.
0375703861|4.0|I was encouraged by this book. The writer is close to my age and it is refreshing to see a writer in her early 20's write produce this kind of quality. A welcome change from other books being produced by people my age, which all seem to have a sameness of perspective and tone, which I would describe very loosely as being sarcastic, introspective, too self-conscious, etc. This aesthetic is difficult to describe, but whatever it is I am glad I am not detecting it in Smith's writing.    <br />By contrast, her prose is hopeful, cosmopolitan, compassionate, truly witty, funny as hell. Perhaps what I most enjoyed was that it is mature, well-researched and intelligent. And not a hint of of angst or of conforming to a certain generational aesthetic. There really is no comparison that I can think of because she is writing a genuine, mature book the very first time around. It really did make me hopeful that we will start to see a kind of maturation and indeed a renaissance among literary and other creative people in their 20's. I want to see more of this kind of work from people my age. It made me want to start my own novel and see where it goes. This may all sound a but over-the-top but the book is that good. Impressive. <br />I had to give it four stars only because of certain moments, especially toward the end, where the dialogue started to break down a little, as if the characters were becoming flat and two-dimensional, while before they were living and breathing. I think this is simply because the ending is too long, overwrought, and baroque. It just seemed to go on and on like she just couldn't bear to give up whatever ending she had in her head. A little editorial detachment and cutting would have helped. Had she wrapped it up more neatly there wouldn't have been any problems.  <br />Looking forward to her next one, which from what I've heard should be more of the same funny but affectionate satire.
B00003CY0V|1.0|This is the most pointless exercise in the excesses of current movie cliches.  The basic plot and character of Travolta has some potential but never becomes more than cartoonish.  The sex scenes were insulting because they were pointless...as pointless as Halle Berry's entire character.  Get rid of both and the movie would have been only slightly better.  <br />This is not the fault of the actors, all of whom do their best.  But Travolta steals the show.  Too bad the pointless, insulting, gratuitously overladen-with-sex-and-explosions plot ruins everything.<br />Rent before you buy or you may be sorry.  You may be as sorry as I was for wasting the money on the rental.
0375703861|4.0|I was encouraged by this book. The writer is close to my age and it is refreshing to see a writer in her early 20's write produce this kind of quality. A welcome change from other books being produced by people my age, which all seem to have a sameness of perspective and tone, which I would describe very loosely as being sarcastic, introspective, too self-conscious, etc. This aesthetic is difficult to describe, but whatever it is I am glad I am not detecting it in Smith's writing.    <br />By contrast, her prose is hopeful, cosmopolitan, compassionate, truly witty, funny as hell. Perhaps what I most enjoyed was that it is mature, well-researched and intelligent. And not a hint of of angst or of conforming to a certain generational aesthetic. There really is no comparison that I can think of because she is writing a genuine, mature book the very first time around. It really did make me hopeful that we will start to see a kind of maturation and indeed a renaissance among literary and other creative people in their 20's. I want to see more of this kind of work from people my age. It made me want to start my own novel and see where it goes. This may all sound a but over-the-top but the book is that good. Impressive. <br />I had to give it four stars only because of certain moments, especially toward the end, where the dialogue started to break down a little, as if the characters were becoming flat and two-dimensional, while before they were living and breathing. I think this is simply because the ending is too long, overwrought, and baroque. It just seemed to go on and on like she just couldn't bear to give up whatever ending she had in her head. A little editorial detachment and cutting would have helped. Had she wrapped it up more neatly there wouldn't have been any problems.  <br />Looking forward to her next one, which from what I've heard should be more of the same funny but affectionate satire.

B000003S09|3.0|Look people, I DO NOT HATE FRIPP OR CRIMSON!!!! What does puzzle me however is the infinite praise this album has and still does recieve. The album is on 'my desert island cds' and 'best albums of all time', lists on amazon, but why? The first song which I thought was supposed to be a classic(21st century schizoid man) was so unfocused and lame, I almost returned it. The next track is better though: I talk to the wind. The lyrics and music are superb. It's a very liad back track to fall asleep to. The next track: Epitaph is my favorite song of the album. It talks about the danger of knowledge, with more great lyrics and music. <BR>The next two tracks: Moonchild, which is too long, and boring, and In the court, just make me want to trash this cd. I mean come on people, I give them credit, KC were the first prog rock band but their first record was not by any means a classic. I dislike the first KC lineup, which is why when I heard the later lineup of Wetton, Fripp, Cross and ohh.. what the devil is the durmmers name again...<br />This being the first KC album I bought, I was completly turned off. If you were too, pick up Larks tongues in aspic, it should be your piece of cake if this wasn't.   <br />If you were on an abandoned island, with a stereo and an unlimited supply of batteries and could have one cd which one would it be? If your answer is this album: you belong on a desert island.
B00005JKJA|4.0|This is a movie that one part Blue Velvet, one part Lost Highway, or you could say it is Twin Peaks meets Lost Highway.   the first ninety minutes are treading into familar territory seen in Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks, then the film turns very weird like our charcters are descending into a new nightmare of the first ninety minutes were the nightmare and they are waking up from the nightmare into the nightmarish reality only to be sucked back into the nightmare at the end.   Lynch isn't your traditional filmmaker.   he makes his films function on dream logic and part of this comes from his painter's eye.   he has always been a painter first and the film only makes sense in th way your own dreams or nightmares do.   Dreams have many interpetations just like David Lynch's films have many meanings and under currents and many ways to look at the movie on what you thought it all meant.  This drives some people crazy.  If you want a traditional narritive, skip this movie.  If you want to be challenged by your movies, this might be the one for you.   Too bad the DVD doesn't have a director's commentary from David Lynch or an alternate version feature that would show the original ABC pilot.
B000002JSN|4.0|This being the second LZ album (my first being Houses of the holy), so I knew what to expect from this band...or si I thought.<br />This album was orginally supposed to be just a single record but LZ found that they could not put the eight songs they had recorded on a single record.  The band knowing this collected unreleased songs from earlier albums and put out a double album.  The tracks recorded for Physical Graffiti like Kashmir, In my time of dying, In the light (personal favorite,good love JPJ on keyboards) and ten years gone have a heavier blues sound to them.  The previously unreleased material like: The rover, houses of the holy, bron-yr-aur etc are pretty diverse, but contrary to what some fans think, don't really sound out of place.  Bron-yr-aur for example, which was recorded during the III sessions, and has that feel to it, as does Houses of the holy.  <br />For the first time however, we have some really bad filler.  Sogns like Black country woman, sick again and boogie with Stu, keep me from giving this sprwaling double album the five stars i deserves.  It's strange though, the folk songs 'Zep used to write are out, replaced by a heavy bluesy sound.  Soem may see this as an improvement, others as a mistake.  I fall in between.  I don't really yearn to the folky tunes of the past, and why should I can hear them whenever I put in one of LZ's previous albums, but the sound was a part Zeppelin all the same.  <br />So do I recommend the new or the curious to pick up?  YES!  not Zeppelin never really put out a bad album, haters of Presence and In through the out door should make more of an effort, those are great albums, so pretty much any album they recorded is not only good but timeless too.  You can't wrong with this band kids!
B000059QY2|5.0|Loved the imaginative interpretation from the foreboding dream-sequence introduction all way to the stark reality of watching Gilda's body be bundled by her murderers. Pavarotti is excellent as an impatient, eye-rolling self-centered duke and Ingvar Wixell was tremendous as the depressed and enraged buffone. The overdubbing slightly off from time to time, but that would be my ONLY complaint. I wish they were all this good.
044022165X|5.0|The Rainmaker by John Grisham is Great fun to read, a captivating thriller that keeps you on your toes from beginning to end. A definite must read especially if you are into court dramas or suspense. The main Character Rudy Baylor is very likeable and the plot is complex and extremely entertaining. It's summer in Memphis and Rudy and his aspirations to breeze through law school and being set for life are crushed beneath an avalanch of creditors and shady dealings with the law. Now rudy doesn't have a job and his only chance is an insurance dispute that leaves a son dieing and par ents mourning. By the time rudy gets to court, a heavyweight corprate defense team is there to meet him. Broke and desperate to win this case Rudy exchanges yard work for rent and works endless hours in his dank office on a case that will either bury him or make him the biggest rainmaker in all the land.
B00005NTN5|5.0|GINA GERSHON - briefly spectacular even her Jockeys  ...  and Ms. JENNIFER TILLY? Same thing except in high heels and then some. Yes, it's a somewhat odd couple and stranger bedfellows, longing for the uncomplicated good life and quite prepared to do what they have to do to get there without breaking a nail [well, almost!].<br />This is a delightful quirky little thriller about these two gals pulling a fast one on 'dumb lug' Joe Pantoliano [also excellent and very underrated].<br />The brothers Wachowski acquit themselves admirably, and this little caper is well worth having in your collection of greats - big and small. Superb art direction and elegant couture too plus a tattoo or two for good measure....
B00005J6UP|5.0|OH SO GOOD!  Remember being a kid and telling stories about the grouchy old lady that lived at the end of the block (you were just positive that she was really a witch)?  A nostalgic romp that really grabs your heart and soul to truly make you feel good.  The kids go on a treasure hunt to save their homes from getting bulldozed for a golf course.  Kids love the movie, but you will love it too.  A mixed bag of kid and adult jokes (just like Shrek) blended with perfect timing so that you will both walk away with something different.  Great family fun, you will love it, I promise.
B00003CXSP|2.0|The beauty of Silence of the Lambs was that most of the tension was psychological.<BR>The flaw of this movie is that the 'terror' of the movie relied on visualizing the violence, it did so in excruciating detail, designed more to sicken the viewer than scare them.<br />Ick.
6305696071|4.0|Cinderella, Julia Roberts style!  A really enjoyable movie that you won't admit to owning, but will watch at least once every six months.  Julia plays the accidental prostitute destined to be swept away by rich (and only used a prostitute once in his life) corporate mogul Richard Gere.  Every once in a while Hollywood casts a movie so perfectly that the chemistry creates wonderfully entertaining energy, this is one of those.  It was done so well that they tried to re-create it with (the less successful) Runaway Bride.  It is funny and really very endearing, truly charming.  Julia (as usual) does a fantastic job and even Richard (an irritating snob) manages to carry his own weight.
0553801481|4.0|Robin Hobb (Megan Lindholm) has attracted quite a devoted audience with her last two sets of books, the Farseer 'Assassin' trilogy and the Live Ship Trader series, and with good reason, as these are fantasies of quite a different stripe from the normal and told with power, wit, and depth. While not absolutely necessary to enjoying this book, as there are enough explanatory sections here to catch the gist of the action of the prior books, I do recommend that you read the Assassin trilogy first, as it will not only provide the reader with all the past action, it will give you a fine benchmark of the how the characters were at the time of those books, allowing you to easily see the changes that time has wrought.<br /><br />This book picks up 15 years after the ending of the Farseer set, with FitzChivalry Farseer and his Wit bond-mate wolf Nighteyes leading a quiet life as a farmer trying to raise his adopted son Hap, carefully avoiding any traffic with his former life of intrigue as a royal assassin. This early section of the book is remarkable for how strong the character development is, even though there is almost no action during this portion, showing a much more mature Fitz who has almost come to terms with the sacrifices he was required to make in the earlier books. Of course, this idyllic setting can't last, as first his former mentor Chade arrives for a visit to try and convince Fitz to return to service at Buckkeep Castle, followed  by the very enigmatic Fool, now known as Lord Golden, and finally is convinced to return to Buckkeep by a summons from Chade to help find Prince Dutiful, Fitz's son by body, but not by himself as a person, who has either been kidnapped or run away.<br /><br />Thus the action is enjoined, leading Fitz not just away from his farm, but into consideration of the whys and needs of both his Wit and Skill abilities. A set of considerations that have relevance for everyone, questions on should you lead if you can, can you let a social injustice continue when you have the means and ability to do something about it, about the importance of life and the time to properly allow death to reign, the strength of personal relationships and what is owed to friends, where the responsibilities of a parent begin and end. Throughout, Fitz, Nighteyes, and the Fool continue to grow as characters, till you feel that these are people you know, have lived, ached, lost and triumphed with.<br /><br />Hobb's descriptive powers are well in evidence here, and her characters are neatly folded into her imagined universe, that includes not just the world of Wit and Skill of the Assassin works but also is explicitly tied to her Live Ship set, though that tie, so far, is only mentioned in passing, not fully developed. This book, unlike so many that are planned as part of a larger group of works, is very complete in itself, with an excellent resolution to all the problems and concerns it starts with. But I have a feeling the next book will make more of the tie to the Liveships and Bingtown traders, and I am looking forward to it.en you have the means and ability to do something about it, about the importance of life and the time to properly allow death to reign, the strength of personal relationships and what is owed to friends, where the responsibilities of a parent begin and end.

B00003CXTF|5.0|Over all Pearl Harbor is an exciting war/love epic which will move you to tears. It has masive action plus a twisted love triangle which will draw the viewer(s) in! For all you guys, there are tons of blood and dead bodies EVERYWHERE. Bombs explode... people get blown up... and Michael Bay does a great job directing the film (There is also a short love scene that you might be interested in seeing). And for all the girls, there are romantic scenes which will make you cry and use up a box of tissue(you'll finish the box and many more). Pearl Harbor is a wonderful and astonishing love story with flying guts and blood(dramatic/action film)! Besides the great storyline the actors are the best. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are soooo HOTT in the movie! As for Kate Beckinsale, she's pretty and she'll make you wish you were in love like her character in the movie. The costumes were amazing and the movie will have you glued to your seat(even if it's 3 hours long). I was shocked, myself, that it didn't get nominated for a golden globe or an academy award! The time was worth it and a part of me even thinks it was too short. The plot was great and Pearl Harbor would make an excellent book!!!! Pearl Harbor is a movie which will truly live in infamy!
B000056K04|4.0|is what this album is overall.  Is it good?  Yeah, if you can find it in you to get past the traditional Dave Matthews beat and lyrics.  The deep and poetic Dave Matthews is still the singer here, and uses lyrics that still amaze.  Maybe DMB is looking to either refine or add to an already popular image.  Either way, I hope to see more like this...but no way will I ever let go of the old stuff!
0140186409|3.0|In John Steinbeck's fictional classic, The Grapes of Wrath, readers get aboard the Joad family's jalopy and venture through the southwestern part of America during the 1930s Dust Bowl.  Through Steinbeck's intense descriptions and meticulous detail, his characters pop out of the book, and become alive in the reader's imagination.  Due to these dynamic figures, readers begin to feel their emotions, experience their struggles, and share in their happiness.  Although the tone underlines a grueling expedition, one filled with hardships, losses, and failures, readers still recognize that tremendous bond and overwhelming love within a family can prevail over all.  Steinbeck's use of setting is critical in the book.  The setting adds to the impact of suffering experienced by the characters and sets the dismal tone for the novel.<br /> The characters are so extensively described that a perfect portrait of each member of the journey is painted into the readers mind.  Physically and emotionally we know who they are:  laugh when they laugh, cry when they cry.  The book sends a powerful message of everlasting love which is identified with all readers.  The dry, dusty, hot, and painstaking setting is influential in the family's drive.  The luscious, green, moist land of California lures the readers in for an unreachable dream, and symbolizes a life that the Joad's can never have.
B00005OB0A|2.0|The first time when u listen to her first hit &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot;, it will stick in your head with her catchy chorus line of LA LA LA. You may even like it for a start. But it won't be long that you get sick of the LA LA LA as well. This song has no exceptional lyrics too.<br />The rest of the album sounded the same, the same catchy beat, that you will probably not listen to it after a few plays.<br />Though Kylie has made a break through after a long break but her vocals is not something that you would give credit for. You  may like to give credit only to her catchy tune of her songs.
B000056K04|1.0|One of my friends trying to sell his copy of Everyday. When desperation turns funny:<br />&quot;Dave Matthews and Glen Ballard create a steaming pile of pop on Everyday. I can't bear to have this musical abhorrence sitting in my collection anymore. Please buy this, I don't care if I lose money on it. I'll even foot the bill on shipping costs. Buyer can have the album shipped pre-scratched and broken, or opt to do it him/herself once they hear this terrible recording. If you like this awful album, see also other peoples' auctions for more bland modern rock albums, such as Creed, Nickelback, and Matchbox 20 (sorry, &quot;twenty&quot;). As it stands, it's in excellent condition, and has only been listened to one and a half times. I accept check, money order, and paypal.&quot;<br />It's funny because all of it is true. Avoid like antrax.
1558216847|4.0|First, this book is a real page turner, and I rate it very high for sheer entertainment value.  I wish there were more novels written with the same passion, tension and spirit.<br />Now to the burning question -- is it a true story or not.  My conclusion is that it doesn't really matter.  This is one of a legion of post-war memoirs that at best stretch the truth and at worst are out-and-out fabrications.  This has been true from The Iliad to All Quiet on the Western Front; from Thucydides through Norman Schwarzkopf's memoirs.  I chalk this one up to myth -- myth being defined as &quot;something that never was true but always will be.&quot;  Tell yourself that this book is a &quot;true&quot; and gripping depiction of the indominatability of the human spirit and don't sweat the rest.

B000059ZLH|4.0|Quick points about Dream Theater, the band - they are awesome musicians.  The group is truly one of the best all time metal bands in my opinion.  I don't care for the singing but everything else is absolutely superb.  And ladies, for what its worth, my wife thinks the guitarist, John Petrucci, is cute, so you might dig `em for that too - that's all right `cause he stinking shreds!!!  Anyway, the DVD quality is really good.  I had to take away a star because the video f/x are pretty stupid looking (you don't really need \\"Dream Theater\\" flashing across the screen 30 minutes into the show - I think you'd have figured out who you are watching by then.  Another reason for the star deduction is that I felt the sound quality, while very good, wasn't up to the level that I experienced live - particularly John's acoustic (simulated) guitar sound isn't as sweet on the DVD as when I saw the show live here in Houston.  In summary, if you are a DT fan, you need this DVD.  If you are not a fan, you need to be and therefore need this DVD.  If you hate cool music played by technically skilled musicians, don't buy this CD.
B000009QPE|2.0|This was the beginning of the bad for Slayer.  Angle of Death is the only good song on the album. The rest of the songs are all way too short and they all sound the same for those of you looking for a good slayer album check out \\"Show no Mercy.\\" It's a great album and its full killer guitar riffs.
B000003NA4|4.0|This album makes you feel warm and comfortable.  Excellent singing and playing by all parties.  This group has great chemistry, and the combo without the drums allows the subtle details to shine forth.  Excellent ensemble playing. Particularly interesting is &quot;My love is&quot;, a duet between Krall and her bassist.<br />There's nothing here that really cooks, which is the only downside.  I'd like to hear at least one track that allows everyone to really go nuts.  But maybe that's not the point of this album.
0792844882|5.0|Ok, I know this movie isn't a comedy, but each time I view it, I can't help laughing! The dialouge is absolutely rediculous, and the acting is also rediculous. This definitely should have been released as a comedy. It is a campy movie, and I am a huge fan of camp movies. If you're into those types of movies, then this is right up your alley, and probably one of the best camp movies ever made!
B00005JKQX|5.0|I have a new addition to my personal top-ten list of movie greats! The suprizes and supense in this movie will have you on the edge of your seat and you'll spend much of the movie thinking that everyone is crazy except Russel Crowe! It's great!
B000002GEY|5.0|You've heard all the songs.  You know it's a great album. Isn't it about time you replaced that old LP with a CD?  Just buy it!
B00003CXIY|5.0|This is a great film which is very funny.  The DVD is better still because it has deleted scenes etc and has the best scene in the movie.  It is a deleted scene when Kyle needs the toilet and a bad man comes out of the toilet door at the garage and gives him a noggin.  This is the funniest scene ever and I cannot understand why they left it out in the first place!  Overall it is an excellent film,  a real laugh.

0393317552|3.0|The main problem about this book is that it totally ignores discussing ideology; the western domination of the world is relatively new but the domination of religious and ideological powers is a fairly old concept.  I would argue that as the arabs conccured a fair part of the world to spread Islam, the romans did the same to spread \\"Great Rome\\" and the Western Christians did the same to spread christianity in the middle ages and \\"whatever imperialistic ideas they come up with\\" in modern history.  <br />It must be obvious to anybody that world domination is a result of a \\"relatively advanced\\" civilization implicitly needing more resources and explicitly advocating a religion or an ideology.  This role has been played by several world powers in the last 2500 years and taking current western domination as an epilogue to history is a naiive approach.<br />The fact that civilizations in the old world were dominant needs no explanation; it is enough to do some analysis of resources and geography to understand why but it takes eternity to understand why the natural evolution of an advanced civilization is to seek domination of the other.<br />I will argue that it could have been the chinese who dominated the world if their religious belief had a notion of missionaries, one that is only found in Christianity and Islam.<br />This also applies to capitalism for instance whereby according to western though \\"the whole world needs to engage in free trade in order to have democracy and freedom\\", total none-sense if you ask me...<br />Read Jean Baudlliard, \\"The Transparency of Evil\\" to get a phylosophical insight into the issue.
0451167716|5.0|The 1970's novel and hit motion picture The Godfather by Mario Puzo was quite possibly the best piece of literature in America as of today.  It's thorough description of how a Sicilian mafia operates leads one to realize just how organized \\"organized crime\\" is.  Puzo showed ohw much family is worth through his book an movie by his skillful use of the third person objective point of view.  In every paragraph Puzo gives the reader a chance to feel like they are a, Don Corleone, Luca Brasi or a Tom Hagen.  The plot was exceptionally good because after every page turn the plot thickens.  One page could be describing a wedding reception and the next would portray two adulturers in lust.  Puzo modeled the book to have a series of climaxes before the major plot line climax.  This was done to pump the reader up and stretch one's mind so one could comprehend the situtaion.  The conflicts also were many.  Michael Corleone's internal conflict with himself was the biggest in the book. When he went off to college and then to World War II it was planted by society that his family's business was the most immoral work one could do.  Besides Michael's internal conflict there is a big conflict with the Corleones and the Tatalias.  After the Corleone's Don was shot the plots conflict thickened from water to syrup.  Overall Mario Puzo worte an American Classic, which was true in the 1970's and will remain true always and forever.
006092988X|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith, is one of America's timeless classics. The story of young Francie Nolan will touch your heart and forever change your view of life. A young girl growing up in the Brooklyn of the early 20th century, Francie had to face the many hardships of poverty as well as just growing up. Some of Francie's experiences are funny, and others almost brought me to tears. This book isn't famous for the phenomanal writing style of Betty Smith, because the book is written plainly and simply. Smith doesn't mince words getting to her points, but shows the life of Francie plainly and bluntly. From selling junk to earn a few extra cents, to an interesting fishing trip, Francie's life is just so different. This probably ranks number 2 on my list of all-time favorite books, right behind The View From Saturday. You haven't lived life completely until you have read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. I would reccomend it to all girls over twelve or thirteen, because some of Francie's experiences are a bit inappropriate for some younger readers. A must-read!
B0000035E7|5.0|1989, 2 years before \\"Nevermind\\" was released, the album that changed Nirvana for better or for worse. \\"Bleach\\" is a window into what Nirvana always was deep down inside, pure grunge. To call this Cobain's must genius work wouldn't be a falsity, because in all honesty I believe every one of Nirvana's albums hold their own place in the sun. However, like I said earlier, this is Nirvana's most raw release, it epitomizes what grunge was and (barely) still is about. \\"Negative Creep\\" & \\"Mr. Moustache\\" remain my two personal favorites on the album, but don't get me wrong the whole album is pure genius, from the man who was tragically taken from us much to early, R.I.P. Kurt Cobain.
B000002GY9|5.0|This was the very first Tom Waits album I bought and my God...I was speechless after hearing it. When the album opened with Tom Trauberts Blues, I was instantly addicted to it. That song broke my heart and put it back together again, finally had I found a singer that sang with the voice of my own scarred heart and soul. And thats something that I am constantly reminded of throughout the albums of the poet and genius that is mr. Tom Waits.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I sat down to watch this film, as my girlfriend loves it, and I had heard quite a few things about it, at both ends of the spectrum.  After sitting through two hours of an awful story that was blatantly lifted from &quot;Shakespeare in Love,&quot; I was in a bad mood.  I realized I had seen what I consider to be one of the three worst films of all time.  Now, people who are more into visuals and less into story will like this, as the visuals are fairly interesting.  The music was interesting, since it was one medley after another, but I didn't find any of them very compelling or moving.  The cast was great, but couldn't do much with such a cliche script.  If I had my choice, I'd bury the master reel of this film at the bottom of the ocean, and pray that no other human has to endure the two hours of spoon fed schlock that I did.  Some will claim to enjoy this film, but I just can't see how.  It's reall, really bad.
B000002J1I|4.0|I know alot of YES fans have no use for this album, but I like<br />it alot! I got this album for Christmas back in 1978, along with<br />a LITE-BRITE set(remember those?), so this album reminds me of<br />LITE BRITE!It's a very colorful album!!! It was also my intro-<br />duction to YES, and while I dont recommend it to people as an<br />introduction to YES, I still highly recommend it! For one, it's<br />much more exciting and dynamic than GOING FOR THE ONE, tho' it's<br />not as musical(perhaps!). Secondly, there are some absolutely<br />wonderful songs here: Onward is the most beautiful and melodic<br />song that YES has ever done, with some very sweet love lyrics<br />from Chris Squire and some very emotional singing from Jon Ander-<br />son.( The live version of this on KEYS TO ASCENSION, PART TWO is<br />even better!). Arriving UFO is also a wonderful song, tho it's<br />quite a departure for YES. Rick Wakeman's synthesizers on this<br />song and quite a few of the others has a very futuristic sound to<br />them. Chris Squire's bass playing on this song is outstanding;<br />his bass line is all over the place and even the percussion on<br />this song is...well...good! Tis a very exciting song! Another<br />great song from this is RELEASE, RELEASE, which rocks out harder<br />than any other song on the album. My favorite part of the song<br />is the instrumental section, with Alan White's drum solo and<br />Steve Howe's guitar solo right after it. The crowd sounds are a<br />nice touch! Circus of Heaven is an interesting song and has a<br />guest vocal from JON ANDERSON'S son DAMIAN. It's a quirky little<br />number and alot of YES fans may find it corny, but I like it!<br />  This is a very listenable album; very sci-fi oriented in it's<br />lyrics and very futuristic sounding and very catchy and accessi-<br />ble.
B00004STPT|5.0|I enjoyed the film immensely, though I do like a happy ending. None the less the soundtrack was perfect in its composition providing the right balance for action and reflective sequences. In scoring this film I felt that Hans Zimmers composing had turned a corner and lets hope he can produce more of the same. His other work is good but in my opinion this is his best to date. I have said it before and will say it again, a good soundtrack depicts the film and it's moments without having to see the picture. When I listen to it I can imagine the opening battle or the arena combat. Well done Hans Zimmer, and Lisa Gerrards vocals are haunting and excellent!<br />P.S - Dont touch the More Gladiator Music with a ten foot barge<BR>      poll, very dissapointing and nothing worth noting to offer.
B00003CXCK|5.0|\\"Schindler's List\\" is Steven Spielberg's powerful and emotionally charged adaption of Thomas Keneally's novel, the fact based story of Oskar Schindler, member of the Nazi party and war profiteer who, by an extraordinary act of redemption, saved the lives of more than 1,000 polish Jews during the holocaust. <br />Straightforward and unsentimental, apropriately filmed in black & white without the use of storyboards--the gritty camera work avoids the \\"slick\\" look often seen in most Hollywood motion pictures. That is because \\"Schindler's List\\" is something different than most Hollywood motion pictures. Despite its 187 minute duration, \\"Schindler's List\\" moves along at a brisk pace; Spielberg never spends too much or too little time in any scene.<br />Entire cast is excellent, notably: Liam Neeson is superb as Oskar Shindler; Ben Kingsly is endearing as Schindler's mild mannered accountant, Itzhak Stern; Ralph Feines is all too convincing as the execrable concentration camp commandant, Amon Goeth; Embeth Davidtz begs sympathy as Helen Hirsch, the Jewish servant and object of Goeth's perverse desires.<br />Buyoed by an intelligently written screenplay, Steven Spielberg has once again delivered nothing short of a masterpiece (definitely his personal best in a plethora of triumphs), and perhaps the finest motion picture ever.<br />Often difficult to watch, \\"Schindler's List\\" effectively conveys the terror and hopelessness experienced by the more than 6,000,000 innocent victims of Hitler's \\"Final Solution\\". At the same time, it offers a message of hope and the power of redemption. Hopefully, this stunning account will educate enough as to avoid repeating one of mandkind's darkest chapters.
B00005T30L|1.0|Listen, I am the first guy to line up to see some odd, dark little indie, especially when someone like Steve Buscemi is in it.  I had not really heard much about plot, theme, or even specific scenes, but just that low frequency buzz from critics about what a great film this was.<br />I will never do that again.  Bring on the high-priced Hollywood Trash movies.  This was such a letdown, and that was with REALLY low expectations.  It was filled with lame characters, dreary settings, and absolutely no sense of direction.  NONE of the characters is even remotely likable, and the dialogue was pitiful.  There was no sarcasm, no wit, no irony, short of an immature 18 year old's idea of them.  The ONE subplot (in a film really with out a main plot) about the chicken place's racist past and the art controversy is a glimmer of hope, but goes nowhere.<br />Save your time, save your money.  I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.  Make the prisoners down at Guantanamo Bay watch this a few times, and they will tell us everything.  I am sorry to all of you who liked it, but isn't there an alienated teen movie out there that is at least funny?
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Lady Marmalade-the song has a nice hip hop beat. Nice to listen to and to belt out. Roxanne-a personal favorite of mine. A nice instrumental song combined with a story and a plea. Sparkling Diamonds was a great combo piece with nice sexual undertones. One Day I'll Fly Away was a beautiful piece. Your Song and Come What May are perfect love songs, a must to hear Ewan sing to. Elephant Love Medley combines so many great love songs. Hindi Sad Diamonds may make more sense once you have seen the movie. And Compliante De La Butte, you don't have to know French to get the lovey feel of this tune. Rufus Wainwright has a way with words...(Hallelujah, Shrek) This soundtrack can fit any mood of the cult classic lovers.
067101756X|5.0|The surest way to confirm the legitimacy of Corso's assertions is to look for corroborative testimony from still-living individuals specifically named in the book.   Dr. Steven Greer and The Disclosure Project have done precisely that in video taped interviews with the likes of astronaut Gordon Cooper and USAF Capt. Robert Salas, a nuclear missile launch commander, among others.   Written transcripts of these interviews are included in Dr. Greer's book Disclosure.<br />Astronaut Cooper and Capt. Salas both describe first-hand encounters with positively-identified extraterrestrial spacecraft exactly as detailed in Corso's book, and both are prepared to testify under oath under penalty of perjury before the US Congress regarding these events, as was made amply clear in a Disclosure Project press conference at The National Press Club May 9, 2001.   Moreover, more than 400 other fighter pilots, airline pilots, air-traffic controllers, senior level FAA officials, military intelligence officers, astronauts, aerospace engineers and the like have now been identified by The Disclosure Project, many of whom personally knew and worked with Col. Corso, and all of whom have publicly stated they too are prepared to testify under oath before Congress regarding their first-hand encounters with positively identified extraterrestrial spacecraft and ET beings, both living and dead.   Hearings may be held on this issue pending Congressional review of a completed dossier of affidavits from Disclosure Projects witnesses, including Col. Corso's son, Philip Corso Jr.<br />Despite what others commenting here would have you believe, Corso's career was anything but \\"pedestrian.\\"   Col. Corso served on President Dwight D. Eisenhower's National Security Council, and was among Gen. MacArthur's most trusted advisors in Korea.   He also served as Director of the Foreign Technology Desk at the Pentagon.    The desperation of the debunkers is nowhere more clearly evinced than in their pathetic, failed attempts to belittle this man's historic military career.<br />The only caveat to this glowing review pertains to Corso's assumption that the ETs are here on a hostile mission.   The ETs have violated US airspace at will for more than 50 years now; this in combination with their having disabled at least two US nuclear missile silos (as reported by Corso and confirmed by Disclosure Project witnesses Capt. Robert Salas, Col. Ross Dedrickson, Brig. Gen. Stephen Lovekin, Chief Master Sgt. Daniel Salter, and others), and their having disabled at least one ICBM on a high atmospheric test flight (as reported by Col. Corso and confirmed by Disclosure Project witnesses Chief Master Sgt. Salter and Col. Dedrickson) apparently led Corso to assume the ETs to be of hostile intent.   But I (and the witnesses of The Disclosure Project) submit that the above-mentioned incidents serve only to demonstrate the peaceful nature of our extraterrestrial neighbors.   Indeed, the enormous restraint they have shown, even in the face of having several of their scout craft actively shot down by the US military (as was the case in the  \\"crash\\" at Roswell), clearly illustrates they are anything but hostile.   If they were here to take our planet away from us, they would have easily exterminated Homo sapiens more than 50 yrs. ago.<br />Nonetheless, I sincerely believe this to be among the most important books ever written.   In light of the voluminous and highly credible corroborative testimony detailed in Dr. Greer's Disclosure (which may rightly be regarded as a companion book of sorts to Corso's The Day After Roswell, as it is replete with references to Corso's book), the importance of Corso's work simply cannot be overstated.   I encourage everyone to purchase a copy for themselves, and a hardcover volume for donation to a library of their choice, as no serious collection could ever be considered complete without Corso's The Day After Roswell.
B000002572|5.0|the album is incredible, every song is great, every member is great, tom shultz is just spectacular at guitar, the singer provides incredible,memorable,vocals with a lot of vocal range, the drummer is one talented kid. heh. and the fact that they are from boston is GREAT, boston is such a spectacular city. i could go on for hours about this cd but i wont, 'more than a feeling' is a GREAT song, and a great opener also. well if u dont have this cd u should get it, and if u do then you are cool in my book...
B00003CXA2|1.0|I had the terrible misfortune of seeing this movie at a friend's house.  I felt as though I should have been reimbursed for the time I wasted watching it.  I was very offended by the mere premise of this \\"film.\\"  Don't question authority and try not to think too much.  Just go through life in a haze and you'll achieve more than the guy who spent his life learning and working hard.   Forrest Gump was such a half-wit he barely knew he was alive.  Everything was made light of in this movie.  Everyone who ever worked hard to accomplish anything was viewed as a joke and worst of all I couldn't figure out if this was a comedy, drama, or parody.  It failed on all fronts.  It was basically a big nothing.  As a lover of movies, I must issue this warning: Stay away from Forrest Gump.  Life is just too short to waste watching [a movie] like this.
B00005QZWI|4.0|Tolkien's &quot;Ring&quot; is a very long sustained narrative, and is very dense.  And like everything else concerned with this project, some agonizing decisions had to be made as to what is important to get into the movie.  Howard Shore also doesn't have the luxury of years to work things out in perfect detail as Wagner could do with his &quot;Ring.&quot;<br />Some of the choices were made for him:  Peter Jackson took out many of Tolkien's songs.  The prophetic verse of Boromir's dream is also inexplicably missing.  So, we can't fault him there.<br />I admire many of his other choices:  Yes, go Celtic for the Hobbits and the Elves.  I was impressed that he had original texts prepared in Elvish for him to set to music at appropriate places.<br />However, like most film composers working on a short deadline (again blame industry practices), this score is thin on thematic material.  He makes two or three themes do the work of four or five.  When you are dealing with dense material like this, you need to be more &quot;Wagnerian&quot; in your conceptualization if not your sound.  Music is going to be important in relating things and characters to each other and showing their development.  Because there is not more strongly differentiated music, everything begins to sound muddled.<br />I hope Mr. Shore will have more opportunties to develop music as we begin to meet the other cultures and creatures of Middle Earth.<br />I also hope he will be able to develope some concert pieces from the score much as was done with &quot;The Red Violin&quot; and &quot;Titanic.&quot;<br />All in all this is much better than the uniformly awful first &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; score to the animated movie.   However, the score of the BBC Radio Drama still haunts me with its elegant use of chamber strings, harp and various voices.  Including a counter-tenor for the Eagle!
0345451325|3.0|Its a great book if you like the game. The book tries to tell about 3 different people so you will be reading about one person and then the next chapter it will be someone else. They don't finish some of the stuff like you will be reading about him in the middle of something then the chapters over and you haft to figure out the rest. Over all it gets 3 stars. If it was just on the main charactor John like the book is about it would get 5 and if it explaind more.
B00005JKT8|5.0|Kate & Leopold is a wonderful romantic-comedy movie. When Kate's ex-boyfriend, Stuart, who is living upstairs of her flat found a crack in time and travel to 1876.

There he mets Kate and fall in love with her at first sight. Kate don't belive Stuart when he says Leopold is coming from past but she got effected by the charm, intelligence and kidness of this misterious guy called Leopold. Well you have to watch the movie if 2 centuries difference can hinder Kate and Leopold's love!
B00003CXDZ|1.0|Anybody out there know what CONTEXT means? Well, OK, for the 98% of you out there still scratching your hairdos, it's what is totally absence from this hollywood O-D experience, a mechanical production from beginning to end, touring through 100 years of pop music with all the over-speeded charm of a 42nd street live porn show. This is the audio-visual equivalent of too much acid & speed taken at the same time by the wrong person. MAJOR DOO-DOO!
B00004U8JV|3.0|I recently returned from from Kauai, Hawaii, where JP-1 was filmed in most of its entirety. After seeing the landscape, waterfalls, etc., I had to watch the series again. I put in the DVD and watched JP-1. It was easy to tell that the majority of this film was filmed on Kauai itself. <br />I loaded JP-2 and became disappointed. The story is alright, the animatics are there, but it was easy to tell that most of the scenes were shot in California and not Hawaii. This may seem like a minor detail but I noticed it, and many others did as well, whether they realized it or not. This may've been one of the reasons why JP-2 had poor reviews. When I first watched the movie I thought that something was missing but didn't know what it was. After travelling to Hawaii, and visiting Kauai', I knew what was missing.<br />The scenery shots were shot on the HA. Islands but the close-ups were shot in Eureka Cali. There are no large \\"Redwood-type\\" trees on Kauai. The incongruence is obvious! <br />I thought that I was imagining things until I watched the \\"extra features,\\" portion of the DVD. One of Spielberg's associates discusses the cost of shipping the many vehicles to Kauai, Hawaii, versus shooting in Eureka CA<br />I'm not saying don't rent, or purchase, this film. It is still worth seeing but is the weakest in the JP series!
B00005RYLE|5.0|The feel of the moulded latex box, the patterns moulded on it to mimic the book from the movie, and the ear on the back of the box just makes you shiver as you pick it up.  The pages inside are recreations of the artwork in the Necronomicon in the movie, and the accompanying handbook gives a good history of the film.  The DVD itself is marvelous, from the menu sequence with various undead faces appearing as if through mist, to the director's commentary track - all top rate stuff. I would recommend you all buy this collector's item as it will be well sought after in a few years.
B00003CXA3|5.0|I definitely recommend the &quot;4-star&quot; DVD of this film.  I hadn't seen THE FRENCH CONNECTION in years and, after watching it on disc, I felt that it was as fresh and well-done as it was back when it was made.  Movies today wish they had the impact this one has.  A lean, grainy documentary look, characters that come right off the streets.  And all the extras make it that much more compelling (the fact there was really no script going into production and the filming of the famous car chase sequence are as eye-opening as anything I've seen on special edition DVDs).<br />William Friedkin was definitely at the top of his game with this film and his next film, THE EXORCIST (another outstanding film on a DVD loaded with fascinating extras).<br />Not to be missed.
B00005UEAR|2.0|DT is an amzingly talented band, but let's face it, they're getting wierd and dangerously close do pulling a \\"Rush\\" or a \\"Queensryche\\".  If history has proven one thing, it is this:  When a band \\"branches out\\" and \\"discovers new territory\\" and \\"takes their music in a new direction\\", they lose their fans and wipe themselves off the map.  It is suicide.  You see, if you abandon what made you great, you're not going to be great anymore.  Duh.  Why do progressive rock bands always fail to learn this lesson?  Fans don't change with bands, and these progressive bands always blow it by making this mistake.  Rush found out the hard way, followed by Queensryche, and DT's now 2 albums deep into doing the same thing.  If it wasn't for Dream Theater's reputation, this release would never sell.  I don't care how big of a production it is, this album stinks.  John's getting lazy, and starting to do the thrash/speed thing.  Even the solos are boring.  BORING, John.  DT fans don't want that wastoid headbanger speed crap - they listen to DT because DT was always too good for that garbage.  They want mind-blowing complexity and structure (Images and Words through Infinity, guys).  Nobody wants an overdone, lengthy, 2-CD trip through insanity (talk about utterly boring and lacking in substance).  DT appears to be running on empty.  To the true DT fan, this album is unlistenable, and forces the fan to have to choke this one down just to stay loyal to the band.  It's two entire CD's of dissapointing musical confusion with none of that DT magic we've all become addicted to.  It's all just \\"artsy\\" noise this time.  These guys are all geniuses, but I'm beginning to remember that old saying about \\"too many chefs\\".  I was concerned about DT starting to slip when I heard \\"Scenes\\", because it appears that DT might be pooping out a bit.  Six Degrees just fully validated my growing concern, and proved me right.  Alas, the passing of yet another great progressive metal band.  Oh well, at least wegot a decade of good material out of them before it all fell apart.
B00004WGAI|5.0|I have seen every major movie version of Jane Eyre that has been made, and this one is by far the best.  (If you can get a copy of it, I have a copy of it.)  At just under four hours long, it is the most accurate of any of the movies to the book.  It has everything, from Jane's return to Gateshead to see her ailing aunt to the gypsy scene.  Zelah Clarke portrays the best Jane: she is not too beautiful like many of the actresses who have attempted Jane are (i.e. Susannah York and Joan Fontaine). Timothy Dalton makes a wonderful Mr. Rochester: you can see his mind working as he schemes to make Jane love him.<BR>The only thing that bothers me about this version is how good looking Timothy Dalton is.  Edward Rochester is supposed to be fairly ugly, and as everyone knows, Timothy Dalton is incredibly handsome.  Even so, his marvelous acting ability still makes him the best there is.<BR>Caution to viewers:  Since this version is so long, there are many parts of it that are somewhat slow.  Those of you who are avid Jane fans like I am will not find this to be a problem; on the contrary, it makes it better.  If you are wanting something short and to the point, I suggest one of the others.  They are not as accurate, but there are many other good ones.
0061020710|4.0|In &quot;The Color of Magic&quot; Terry Pratchett weaves a tale of light fantasy and some humor to make a good read. Being the first in a series of over 25 books, I'm sure that this is probably not one of the best.<br /> For one thing, his humor wasn't the greatest. He threw in some dumb punchlines but the really good humor wasn't as easy to find. Things such as his &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory were pretty good compared to some other dry stuff. Despite this Pratchett still did a good job in presenting a comical fantasy adventure.<br /> The plot of this novel is pretty simple. Rincewind the Wizard (who graduated from Unseen University knowing no spells because one of the 8 Great spells trapped itself inside of him) meets the tourist Twoflower in a tavern. Twoflower hires Rincewind as his tourguide so he could see Discworld. After Twoflower sets the city of Ankh-Morpork on fire, he and Rincewind make a run for Quirm. Read on to find out the rest.<br /> Pratchett's characters are the actual very funny part about the book. Rincewind is just...Rincewind; Twoflower has to see everything even if it means his existence on Discworld will be no more; the talking sword, Kring; Hrun the Barbarian who fights and has basically a dumb mind; and many other characters that we meet throughout thisnovel are just funny. <br /> What is interesting about this book is that Terry Pratchett takes issues that have arised on Earth and puts them onto Discworld. These things make the world of Discworld seem even more like the one you and I are on right this very second.<br /> In conclusion, &quot;The Color of Magic&quot; is a great read that a fantasy fan or somebody looking for a good book to enjoy. This novel is relatively short and can be read quickly. After reading this I am looking forward to reading more books about Terry Pratchett's Discworld. This is probably the best way to start out this series. Read this, you won't be disappointed.<br />Happy Reading!
B000002AHM|5.0|&quot;Friday Night in San Francisco&quot; is the most incredible acoustic guitar release ever by anybody. Jazz/Rock/Fusion founding fathers John Mclaughlin and Al Dimeola team up with flamenco guitar master Paco De Lucia and the results are breathtaking. The disc starts with three songs(one of each possible pairing), then a live song with all three joining forces, and finally there is a studio song with all three. &quot;Mediterranean Sundance/Rio Ancho&quot; teams Dimeola with Delucia. The two of them display unbelievable virtuosity and the exchanges between them during the solo section are unreal. Audience members can be heard vocalizing their disbelief throughout this song and the others. This song, as well as all of the others, isn't only about their ability to solo. Try to play,nevertheless write, the chord changes/rhythms that these two created. It is equally as dificult a task as their leads. &quot;Short Tales ..&quot; is a teaming of Dimeola and Mclaughlin. The two pick up from where the first song left off. However, in addition to being an excellent version of the Corea compostion the two have some fun.&quot;The Pink Panther&quot; theme as well as a bit of bluesy improv are included in the spontanaiety. &quot;Frevo Resgado&quot; has John and Paco adding their own madness to the mix. The last live song &quot;Fantasia Suite&quot; finds all three members on stage and is one of the most incredible things that you will ever hear in your life. &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; is a studio recording that gives the listener a sneak peak at &quot;Passion,Grace and Fire&quot; which was recorded after the live tour. &quot;Friday Night in San Francisco&quot; is a landmark recording. All three guitarists display their ability to compose, play and do so impressively.This is one that you should own so BUY IT NOW.

B00004Z459|5.0|This is by far the best CD I've ever owned in my life, and probably will ever own until their second album comes out and its better. Linkin Park is not a certain genre - it is not rap, rock, hip hop, or metal. It is truly its own genre. I've decided this because I've never heard anything like them before.<BR>I don't see how some people consider them so terrible, or \\"one step closer\\" to becoming a boy band. Honestly, do you really imagine Justin Timberlake screaming \\"Shut up when I'm talking to you\\" at the top of his lungs? I don't think so... <BR>Before hearing this album, I was a total pop-crazed idiot. I owned almost all the Now CD's, 2 Britney Spears CD's, 2 'NSync CD's, and pretty much all the other pop artists that I curse now. Linkin Park completely changed my music taste - their lyrics and melodies are beautiful, the screaming doesn't go over the top, and amazingly - THERE ARE NO SWEAR WORDS. That is rare in this music world these days, since it seems like it's painful for Limp Bizkit and DMX, among others, to not throw in an \\"F\\" word every two minutes. <br />1. Papercut 8/10 - This one really get your attention, a great opener. The lyrics are powerful and smart (my favourite line being \\"The sun goes down, I feel the light betray me\\" - I dare Fred Durst to sing something like that), and even the video is awesome. Mike's rapping is excellent here.<br />2. One Step Closer 8.5/10 - Shocking. If I could use one word to describe this song, that would be it, but not at all in a bad way. Over time it has become my second favourite track - at times I can really relate to the lyrics. I even enjoy Chester's screaming at the end - haha, call me crazy.<br />3. With You 6/10 - Honestly, not my favourite, though I still love it. The lyrics are wonderful and the chorus great, but I just can't to seem to keep my attention on it. It's still great, though.<br />4. Points of Authority 10+/10 - By far my favourite track on the CD. It confuses me that it isn't being played on theradio as much as \\"In the End\\" is, the lyrics are fabulous and the opening verse is completely original. Not to mention it's also fun to sing along to... *grin*.<br />5. Crawling 8.5/10 - This one grows on you. Some people may think \\"Oh, it's genius\\" and I'm slowly realizing that it is, though not as genius as other songs. The lyrics are powerful, Chester's voice is at his best, even the shock of jumping from soft singing to intense screaming adds flavour. The video is beautiful as well, the story is somewhat moving. This song deserves praise.<br />6. Runaway 5.5/10 - I catagorize this one with \\"With You.\\" Great song, but not as grabbing. It's actually a good song to hear if you're new to the band, next to \\"In the End,\\" since it isn't as shocking and the lyrics are great. <br />7. By Myself 8/10 - One of my favourites. It is similar to \\"Crawling,\\" with Chester singing softly during the verses, and then it jumps to the shock of his screaming during the chorus. I love the lyrics, and everything else.<br />8. In the End 8/10 - I know, I know. Am I expected to write endless praise for this song? I admit, it's great, but a little on the overrated side. Great lyrics, great singing from Chester, great rapping from Mike - simply great. It stands out. The piano is beautiful, as is the video. But for some reason it doesn't rank highest on my favourite list... I'm not sure why yet.<br />9. A Place For My Head 8/10 - Another one of my favourites. I love the lyrics and the singing, its fantastic... and again, I love when Chester does his screaming at the end: \\"You try to take the best of me, go away!\\"<br />10. Forgotten 7/10 - Great, but not as great as others. I love it, but I wouldn't call it a favourite. I love how it jumps right into the singing instead of having a instrumental intro, I thought that was cool.<br />11. Cure For the Itch 7/10 - Great addition to the CD. Different, clever, and fun to listen to. Mr. Hahn is a great DJ, and I'm very pleased that they decided to put this track on the CD. It's nice rest from all the powerful songs.<br />12. Pushing Me Away 8/10 - Wonderful song! I'm a little disappointed that they put it on the end of the CD, because by the time I get to it I'm a little worn out. But it's still excellent. Great lyrics, and beautiful music!<br />I recommend this CD to everyone who wants a fabulous break from the songs that are nothing but screaming, swearing, and all the [stuff] that popular music these days are. Linkin Park is a truly great new addition to the music world. Their concerts rock, too *smile*!
B00000K19E|5.0|A great movie to watch on DVD, the action scenes were enormous.  An awesome mix of Computers and good ol down home old fashioned acting.  The best Keanu Reeves movie out there.
B00005KAQP|4.0|Everyone else is commenting on the film so I'll limit my review of this (great) movie to the DVD transfer quality.<br />Sound: 4 out of 5 stars<br />The 5.1 soundtrack is pleasing, but lacking in surround activity and fullness. The PCM stereo on my old laserdisc sounded more enveloping, but thankfully this soundtrack on the DVD has corrected some problems with the old LD release where there was some distortion on the tape during a few points of overload.<br />You'll have to turn this DVD up louder than most...the recording level is lower than average.<br />Picture: 4 out of 5 stars<br />The 4x3 lbxed 1.85:1 transfer is excellent, but it's a shame that Disney (released through touchstone) didn't bother to give us a new 16x9 anamorphic transfer as had been rumored prior to release. Over all not a bad picture (much better than the laserdisc, although both seem sourced from the same transfer), actually quite on-par with may 16x9 anamorphic transfers I've seen on my calibrated 16x9 display. But still a missed opportunity for those viewers able to view the additional 33% resolution that 16x9 encoding provides.<br />The extras are fun, although I would have loved the C&amp;C music factory video of &quot;just a touch of love&quot; rather than the 2 music videos included on on the disc.<br />For those of you who love this movie as much as I do get the DVD. But don't let Disney off easy if you happen to be having lunch with the head of their DVD production division...let him/her know that it's a shame they didn't give the consumer a nice new 16x9 transfer! <br />-dave

B00005QZ7U|1.0|What in God's name has happened to Hollywood.  What has happened to all the wonderful talent that they use to have?  How can Hollywood call this a musical??The musical numbers are very chopy, the acting is something like i've never seen before,,,,,,,UNTALENTED people!!!I really hope this isn't the new direction that Hollywood is taking in new movie musicals because if it is \\"they don't have a clue.\\"If you read my review of \\"Dolly\\" and i gave that \\"1-star\\", this would be a minus \\"100\\". And this is going up for an award?  I'm affraid the days of american good movie musicals are over. Watch the classic musicals and you'll have a much better time.
B00004XMVH|1.0|This travesty of a film really takes the biscuit.<br />Despite what many US reviewers say, films like this form attitudes and opinions in their viewers.<br />Thanks to U-571 many people now believe that the USN secured an enigma machine and saved the free world from Nazism.  What rubbish!!!!!<br />The RN captured the machines, and we had to tell the USN how to run its anti u-boat campaign.<br />Make a film about that.<br />When you take your history and distort it, like in the patriot you just make yourselves look stupid.<br />When you steal someone elses glory you just look like you are desperate for the world to look up to you.<br />The Yanks CAN make really good war films- The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down were all superb, this disgusting rubbish should be scrapped.
6300184269|4.0|...It's totally underrated. Right behind \\"Sixteen Candles\\" in the order of my favorites(with \\"The Breakfast Club\\" in third, \\"Ferris\\" in fourth...and so on), \\"Wierd Science\\" proves to be the best of them all in rewatchability. That statement might be a bit brash, but I think it's true. <BR>The premise is simple enough. Two dorks make thier \\"ideal\\" woman only to find out she's more than a handful(Literally).<BR>Anthony Micheal Hall as Gary carries this movie, his comic timing at it's peak. The scene in the bar demonstrates this. Ilan Mitchell-Smith is very sweet as Gary's best friend. You wonder where he went after this film, because he really shined.(Apparently, now he's a history professor at a Texas university). <BR>Kelly LeBrock is suprisingly funny as the \\"perfect\\" woman Lisa. Much better of an actress than one would think at first glance.<BR>And Bill Paxton as Chet. Priceless.<BR>Gosh, this movie is simply hilarious. Case in point, don't go out and buy \\"Pretty in Pink\\", buy \\"Weird Science\\".
630463949X|5.0|This is truely an excellent DVD!  Lindsey Buckingham sings great solos as well as Chritie Mcvie.  Stevie Nicks sings top notch - It just seems to me like Fleetwood Mac has actually gotton better.  The dvd gives you a real concert feel in 5.1 sound.  The Screen shots couldn't be better set on stage , they added a few female vocalists in background to give it that little extra, not overdoing it and giving it the midas touch.  The instruments - guitars -( very good guitar work) drums , keyboard - all a great sound.  If you are a fleetwood fan this is a must!!! I hope they come out with a newer one soon since its been awhile - 1997 - (and still an awsome recording!)  I hope they don't wait too long if they do decide to get together again or Maybee just Stevie Nicks and one from the band would be nice.  If they wait too long I'm afraid of Stevie's voice going with age, as she gets older and not sounding as strong and vibrant as she still is.
0385470819|5.0|This book was a great book to read. It was great mainly because of the authors use of setting. This is especially good for the novel because it takes place in the olden days. It was back when the black people were almost always looked at as a lower class then the whites. He uses this aspect of setting beautifully to portray Carl Lee as a person in the lower class trying to struggle with the white jury and white judges. This book was one of Grishams best books because it was the most action filled one of the collection. If you read this you will finish a chapter only wanting to read more. At this time the Klu Klux Klan was in a struggle with the blacks and their rights. In one scene it shows the hatred between the black people and the Klan before Carl Lee's court date. I would really encourage everyone to read this book because it is one of the best of today. It also greatly shows the History of white Lawyers that got hatred for defending black people during that time. It was a suspenseful page turner.
B00004SZBU|5.0|I've just bought an SACD player (DAVS-500) and this release was one I wanted to test it out on, (I have it on vinyl and CD as well)- What a difference! (even on a relatively low end player). The record has a full sound with all the pops, hisses and track jumps from years of playing. The CD still sounds good but slightly tinny in comparison, but the SACD is leap years ahead. I could literally hear layers of sound (yes - I was stoned but I've always heard it this way since it was released...whaa? you guys had an actor for president? whoah :)<br />Anyway...I was really impressed. A full, rich sound and really,you can literally hear something like a spacial effect in the mix. It's not multi channel which would have been awesome but it's still really good. If you want the definative version of this great old album - then this is it. Meats voice really packs a punch.<br />I'd also highly recomend getting a multi channel setup if you're looking at getting an SACD. I bought Herbie Hancocks headhunter on 6 channel SACD and its mindblowing - I couldn't believe it was recorded in 1973,it sounds like it was this year or something. I wish they would release more. If anyone who has anything to do with SACD reads this, here's my tip RELEASE THE ENTIRE BACK CATALOGUE OF PINK FLOYD ON MULTI CHANNEL SACD AND YOU WILL MAKE MILLIONS! I guarrantee it! I know I'll buy them all.
6302787300|4.0|This film suffers the same thing all film versions of real events suffer:  real life very rarely provides the suspenseful plot points of compelling fiction (except for Alexandre Dumas, of course).<br />While fiction is more cooperative with the story-telling process, Scott manages reasonably well with these real life events and provides not only a glimpse into the past, but a narrative that manages to capture the emotional essense of what it is like to go to a place where no one has ever been, and to do things other people have never done.  Depardieu's Columbus sums it up so well when he says to someone near the end of the film:  &quot;*I* did it.&quot;<br />But the main reason to watch this film is strictly for the visual technique.  Buffs of visually beautiful films could probably watch this movie with the sound shut off and be utterly spellbound for the over 2 hours it takes to get to the end.<br />It goes long, and editing near the finish makes it seem longer.  Instead of a good flow, we get scenes roughly stitched together to provide something of a summary of events - this weakens the story.  But all the while you will be enthralled with how Scott sees the world through his cameras, and the details of daily living from 500 years ago.  <br />You'll also be left with the emotional resonance of a man's entire life - the cumulative feel of what he accomplished.  You'll feel what it felt like to be the first person to step onto a beach and prove what was once thought impossible.
B00005R87Q|1.0|If you are looking for something more than just racing, and awesome cars, DONT BUY THIS. Aweful acting that makes me want to pull my teeth out at times.
0553106635|5.0|Some folks seem to think he's lost his way with the series; I say rubbish! He knows exactly what's happening, and if he has had to add a seventh book (the upcoming \\"A Feast For Crows\\") simply because the story is too long for six, then all the better for us readers!<br />This is a fantasy epic written as all works of the sub-genre should be written. Unlike the pap of Jordan, Goodkind and Brooks, here are characters that live, breathe and change (Jordan, in particular would do well to learn that little trick). Simply put, this very well may become THE definitive fantasy series when he finishes, surpassing even Tolkien's monumental masterpiece.<br />I eagerly await the next book, so I can find out what has happened to all of my favorite characters.
B00005U8EM|5.0|A highly enjoyable movie with great cast and dialogue.  I can watch this movie over and over again.  Murray's cynicism is perfect for this role.  Something else I find very positive for this edition: The Chinese Mandarin Subtitle.  The production company really cares about its foreign audience to add the Chinese subtitle.  The translation is fitting and regionless.  I would encourage more DVD editions of coming movies to do the same.  This way more Chinese audience outside of USA can enjoy the movies without going for the local pirate version (with lousy translation).  After all, Chinese has a huge population around the world, more than Portuguese and Italians.
B000059MEK|4.0|Daft Punk, the French duo Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel De Homem-Christo, (ANOTHER good French band, its getting scary) are often compared to Electric Light Orchestra, Kraftwerk and Gary Numan and that is pretty accurate. You've heard their music before, remember that Gap commercial with the two dancing robots? That's them dancing to their song \\"Digital Love\\", which is the third track on this CD. It's a great tune, not as funky as the Crystal Method or as hard-hitting as The Chemical Brothers But just as good. This CD is not perfect, a couple of tunes on it are a little too simplistic but overall I really enjoyed it.\\"
B00004Z459|4.0|When Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory first came out, I had no idea who the hell Linkin Park was. After my friend hooked me up the CD and the over-repititious playing of &quot;In the End&quot;, I found out Linkin Park is pretty cool. Besides their sweet music, another good thing about the band is their 100% clean lyrics, so everyone can listen to it, unlike their counterparts, Limp Bizkit.<br />Unfortunatly, I have to bring it up... why is &quot;In the End&quot; so popular? I think it is a &quot;Good&quot; song, (3/5 Stars) but I also think it is overrated and it is a FACT that the song is waaaay overplayed. I'll even go as far as to say that that song is the worst song on the album. Perhaps it is just because I like upbeat music, but I can and do like slow songs. I just don't get &quot;In the End&quot; We made a cool nickname for the song, it's &quot;The Funeral Song&quot;. Get it? I know...
0385335482|2.0|When you read a book that's presented in the first person, that character should be likeable, to entice you to read the book through. Not only was I annoyed pretty much the whole time with Rebecca (lying and being terribly irresponsible), the book in itself was junk. Halfway through, I started skimming the pages for some meaningful action, and was thoroughly disappointed at the end because, even though what she fell into was pure luck, this book does NOT teach a valuable lesson that it should: If you work, you will get rewarded. This character was a fraud and very uninspiring to us all.
B00005R2BG|1.0|Neither my husband nor I enjoyed this movie. It was too fragmented, like looking into a kaleidoscope, although with a kaleidoscope, one can at least freeze the image long enough to get a good look at it. And who could care about these characters? Bring back &quot;Gigi.&quot; Bring back &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot; Bring back Astaire and Rogers.
0887308589|4.0|If you want a great laugh or two, pick this book up at the library or bookstore and read the first two or three chapters. Then, put the book back on the shelf, and go home. You'll want to go back and read more. Don't.<br />I read the first two chapters in the bookstore and I was hooked. I even laughed out loud, and after garnering several unfriendly stares, I decided that I'd take the book home and laugh in privacy. I took it home, but I didn't laugh much. I don't think I laughed at all. Much to my chagrin, I found out that Scott Adams put all of his good stuff up front. Much to my pocketbook's chagrin, I found out that I already read the good stuff for free, and paid for the filler. Maybe it's God's way of keeping me honest. I mean, I did get my money's worth. Only I got it before I spent my money.<br />If you want to support your local bookstore, go ahead and buy the whole book. If you want to support your library, go check it out, return it late, and pay the fine. But if you want to support yourself, don't waste your money on anything past the third chapter. Maybe fourth. Yawn.
B00003Q43A|5.0|After reading some other reviews, I am wondering if they are reviewing the right movie. ID4 was a great movie. It was well written and well directed. An even greater quality of this movie - missed by so many brainless scifi movies since - is the beautifully BALANCED action sequences and special effects. You want to get an idea of UNBALANCE, check out &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Yes, ID4 did not have alot of story (nor was it meant to); neither did &quot;Star Wars&quot;. What SciFi fan did not like SW?
B00005U1YO|5.0|Tom Rolands and Ed Simons, the dynamic duo that make up the Chemical Brothers, have really outdone themselves this time. Frankly, I never really had too much interest in them since their stuff was on the radio all the time. I had a change of heart when I heard track 6 and 7, \\"My Elastic Eye\\" and \\"The State We're In\\" at a local comic book store. Lucky me!<br />   I have to admit that you will need a degree in \\"Advanced Thumpology\\" to fully appreciate this CD. This is a really beat-heavy compilation, not frenetic like an Industrial Rock album but natural sounding, deep, dark and enveloping. It starts off with \\"Come With Us\\", a track that made my speakers, apartment and internal organs resonate due to the Chemical Bros. skillful use of beats and harmonics. But boy, that was a good feeling! The next few tracks are equally thunderous, utilizing a lot of reverb techniques and clever sampling, then things calm down when we get to track 7, \\"The State We're In\\". Seamlessly, the beats start up again and continue unashamedly until the end.*Whew* THIS CD BLEW ME AWAY!
B00003CXDG|2.0|Tom Cruise gives the impression these days that his mere appearance on a movie screen is enough to send shivers of delight through thousands of theatergoers (he may be right; Cruise has NEVER had a box office dud).<br />MI-2 lacks many of the elements that made the first film a lot of fun.  &quot;Mission 1&quot; had a convuluted plot that no one could follow, which almost added to the enjoyment; the plot for the second film is so thin it would barely fill an hour of the TV series; in fact it's hard to believe the screenwriter who gave us &quot;Chinatown&quot; was really responsible (though Robert Towne admits he came on the project AFTER the action scnes had been planned and written).<br />For MI-2, Cruise and his co-producer, Paula Wagner, enlist the talents of Hong Kong director, John Woo, who stages his action scenes with a balletic style, but Woo has no flair for non-action scenes, so the first hour of &quot;MI-2&quot; is paced slower than a Merchant Ivory romance.<br />Although, Cruise and the incredible gorgeous Thandie Newton, make a couple that could grace the cover of any issue of GQ, they ignite no sparks on the screen, and as a villian, the talented Dougray Scott can do no more with his role than pretend to look menacing.<br />Cruise was smart to get involved with the &quot;Mission&quot; franchise, it gives him the financial clout to take on riskier projects such as &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; and &quot;Vanilla Sky,&quot; but with MI-2, he's produced an action film for people who hate action films.<br />DVD package is exceptional...picture and sound quality are excellent and many bonus features include two documentaries; behind the scenes look at many of the action sequences; and the hilarious MTV &quot;Mission Improbable&quot; satire featuring Ben Stiller as Tom CROOZE..
B00005RYLE|5.0|The first time seeing \\"Evil Dead\\" changed my nightmares forever. No more wimpy \\"chased by a ax-wielding monster\\" dreams for me! Somehow this movie plugged in to far deeper reaching fears. I first saw it at a drive-in with my husband. At one of the freakiest parts (the trapdoor), I remember wondering if there was an echo in the car, since there seemed to be more than one piercing scream being emitted. Imagine my surprise to see my husband, my stoic, never scared of anything, hunting and fishing he-man, motorcycle riding husband, screaming at the top of his lungs like a little girl. Of course, he still denies this ever happened, but the truth is this movie scared him half to death.
0385484518|4.0|Everyone else rehashed the book, so all I will offer are comments:<br />- Not surprised to see it was a TV movie. The author's TV experience came through - it's written to be easily scripted into one, with all the repetition of \\"we're Tuesday people\\" and \\"I'm dying - don't say that - it's true.\\" Think the book owes a large debt to Brian's Song which, I don't think coincidentally, involved a sports figure.<br />- For my taste, a bit too much detail about Morrie's medical deterioration.<br />- Delighted to see somebody besides me talk about the value of \\"making your own culture.\\" Best thing in the book!<br />- Historical note - I think it's true that those in the \\"Greatest Generation,\\" while stuck with serious challenges at early ages, were in a social setting which strongly encouraged, facilitated, and rewarded their meeting them courageously, and (at least for those who survived) provided vastly easier establishment in life than for we mid-baby boomers. However, how many of my fellow 44-year-olds made it from such truly austere and awful childhoods to become the like of good college professors? Some from the inner cities, but Morrie's past was much more typical of his generation. Hard to imagine, in a way.<br />Why good but not great?  Excellent insights get it to the former, but the book doesn't even try to advise on implementation.  There are thousands of philosophy-and-advice books materially as good without a tiny sliver of the fame of this one - to name just one, Reflections in a Pumpkin Field by Jay Brickman.
B00005U122|1.0|Are you serious, Roger Waters, if I want Pink Floyd I'll buy anything other than this bad DVD.  Roger Waters needs to get over the fact that Floyd Is what it is without him. He may have at one time been an integral part of Floyd back in the hey day, but don't try to ressurect something that can't be done without Gilmour, Mason, Wright and Company.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
B00004ZEQX|5.0|Being a fan not only of Lucio but also of Italian Gorror, I'd have to give this film an A+. Considering most of my friends needed an introductory film to open the archivesItalian movie making,and then taking into account that they've all avidly started collecting Lucio's works after witnessing this film, I'd have to say it was a success. From the onset, it quickly defeats any notion of cheap \\"screamer\\" movies, giving you scenes that made most people I know salivate. Besides, with a cemetary outside the house and Lucio at the helm, how could you go wrong?
0446525537|5.0|Hands down, this is one of the best books that I've ever read.  The gambit of emotions that this book will send you through is exactly predicted by the auther. He tells you that you'll laugh and then you'll cry and that's certainly what happened.  The descriptive nature of Mr. Sparks writing makes you feel that you are living in small town America and that the warm North Carolina breezes are blowing in your face as you experience the joy and pains of the characters.  YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!
B00005Y1XZ|3.0|The album proper is great, but for the bonus material the leaner Ryko release is better.<br />While the new releases of Spike, Brutal Youth, and All This Useless Beauty are generally fine complements to Rykodisc's re-releases of Elvis' first 10 years, the re-re-release of This Year's Model (much like My Aim Is True) suffers by comparison to the earlier revision.  Aside from the fact that the combined length of the two discs is enough to fit on one, the extra material here isn't essential.  The demo versions aren't all that illuminating, and both they and the live songs suffer from weak sound quality.  It seems Rhino is going for something of a &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; approach in including so many alternate and live bits of lesser quality.  The good bonus stuff was already included in Ryko's version of eight years ago, so if you have that, keep it.  Buy this only if you haven't already upgraded from the lp or original CD.<br />The one benfit this version offers is much lengthier liner notes than before, penned in EC's usual witty style.  He is just as sarcastically bitter here about himself as anyone else.  It would be nice to see this stuff collected in some other form.
B000002WU9|5.0|Back in the day when the Wu dominated Raekwon dropped this little gem. Out of the blue this instant classic was hailed by most hip hop heads as the worthy follow-up to the incomparable &quot;36 Chambers&quot;. Not only does this album contains some of the Chef's best lyrics it also contains some of Ghostface's, U-God, Method Man and even Nas' most memorable moments. From &quot;Knuckleheadz&quot; to &quot;Knowledge God&quot; to &quot;Incarcerated Scarfaces&quot; and &quot;Rainy Dayz&quot; not to mention &quot;Verbal Intercourse&quot; and &quot;Wu-Gambinos&quot; I cannot stress enough how essential this album is to anyone's Hip Hop library but if you don't own it then believe the hype because it is well deserved.
B00003CX9E|5.0|A lot of [people] complain about the transfer not being in widescreen?  Virtually every film made up to 1953 is the same size as your TV. Widescreen aspect ratios were not available in 1941.  So buy the pristine new transfer and enjoy it with the assurance that nothing has been cropped out.  That said, this film is a work of art. Art is open to many interpretations, emotions, and feelings. Not everyone can go into a gallery and pick the same painting and call it their favorite or the best. True, \\"Kane\\" was named the greatest film of all-time by the AFI and that can certainly be debated. Do I think it is the best of all time? Not completely. But I do find it interesting that it is in just about every film director's top ten list. That is perhaps it's greatest influence.

B000003B6J|5.0|Without argument, one of the greatest rap albums of all time. Grandmaster Flash is the first rapper to talk about street life, but NWA amplified it. Without tracks like Straight Outta Compton gangsta rap likely wouldn't exist today.<br />Pros:great beats by Yella and Dr. Dre, Eazy-E's ill voice, Ice Cube & MC Ren's great lyrics, excellent political views, the emergence of the West Coast rap style so many of us love<br />Cons:The beats on Something Like That and Compton's In The House are very similar in beats and lyrics, not enough guest appearances (only 2,The D.O.C on Parental Discretion Iz Advised, Arabian Prince on Something 2 Dance 2)<br />The new NWA album will likely not be very good because Snoop Dogg doesn't fit into this style very well. If you want my opinion, Jayo Felony's agressive style would fit in well, or Ras Kass could add a nice dose of lyricism. However, Snoop has already been added to the line up, so there's nothing we can do.<BR>At least there's a new album coming out soon according to the Aftermath Records website. In other NWA related news, Eazy-E has a 7-track album coming out real soon, so cop that. Maybe Dre will get the rights to put an unreleased Eazy verse on the new album! That'd be ill!!!<br />RIP Eazy-E, we miss you homie
0060987464|5.0|It sure feels like its true and that I really know manson, but it is clearly not that simple. I would have aggressively forked over the cash for this book just for the pictures, alone, and because of the fact that he wrote it. Not even counting the wonderous poems and quotes from those that influenced him, or happened to fit nicely into the book and the fact that this insightful man (against all odds, some people don't usually view rock god/glam-trash idols such as MM as insightful) has written a book that is actually an intelligent look at growing up. This autobiography brings out the creepiest aspects of childhood, conveying the terror and fascination that young Brian felt when looking through his grandfather's pornography, getting his first French kiss, and being taunted by the girls he wanted to \\"date.\\" Manson has the benefit of having grown up as an outcast and loser and then having become a star without forgetting what he went through, which is rare. This gives him an incredibly broad perspective, which he brings to bear on his ordinary life in order to convey the more potent and frightening moments that shaped him into the pale-skinned weirdo that the Christians love to hate. Best of all, Manson is full of honesty, and portrays himself as occasionally stupid, self-centered, overly-sensitive, ignoble, and, most importantly, highly fallible and human. It's a long way from the auto-hagiographies that other stars have written, and it's easily one of the best reads in celebrity bio. This book is a really good example that popular culture is everywhere including the silly-people filled suburbs and smaller bedroom communities.
B00005LLK8|5.0|one of the best movies I have seen.  It could do with a little less profanity but under the circumstances maybe it is appropriate.
B00005OWIU|5.0|More than just a film soundtrack - this music takes you through a breathtaking journey of emotions from the exitement of the Quidditch match to the tension of 'the face of Voldermort.' John Williams mystical theme is fantastic, first heard in prologue it continues to appear effectively in many ways right up until the dramatic climax that is 'Hedwigs theme.' <br />You do not need to have seen the film to benefit from this music - it is outstanding, but who would have expected anything less from John Williams! Those people who have seen the film can sit back and return time and time again to the world of Harry Potter. I find it ultimately relaxing to sit there listening to the music and form the pictures from the film in my mind as I go along, the beautiful 'change of season' is a great example of this as I imagine Hedwig rising with the music and breaking into summer as the music smooths out.<br />Amongst my favourites are 'Hedwigs theme' and 'Harry's wondrous world' which together are a compilation of most the music heard throughout the CD that form the ending credits of the movie. 'Christmas at Hogwarts' and 'A change of season' provide seasonal touches and the beginning 6 tracks take you on a wonderful journey following Harry's change of fortunes. <br />All in all a fantastic soundtrack and well worth buying.
B000002H97|5.0|This is clearly the best cd ever made. I was appalled that it only had 4 and a half stars which drove me to write this review. It deserves more like 6 stars...but it won't let me rate it that high.
B00005RHGL|2.0|Don't get the wrong idea about that 2 star rating -- we LOVED the movie, have worn out two VHS copies.  Have been waiting with excitement for the Director's Cut as we KNOW there are many, many minutes that never made it to the screen.  Want to thank all of you who have reviewed it.  Will NOT be purchasing it now as not particularly interested in all the trailers, interviews, map, etc.  Can only hope now for a Special Edition release.  We want all those clips that would fill in the missing pieces, make this a more cohesive film and enhance the characters.  As to the movie itself ... it's right up there at the top of our BEST FILM list.

B000059XUO|5.0|The Crow always has beeen and always will be one of my favorite movies. Brandon Lee was just amazing in this movie. The film is action packed, and it is THE best directed movie ever (it only slightly beats Blade Runner), but it is also very poetic. It's true this movie is violent as hell, but the violence is justified. He isn't just killing people, it's justice. this has been a cult classic for me since the first time I saw it. Visually stunning, incredibly acted and oozing with style, this is one movie no one should miss.
B000001F3C|5.0|I remember in '83 a buddy saying that Live Under a Blood Red sky was the greatest live album ever.  The version of Sunday Bloody Sunday and Electric Co. make a strong case.  Too bad Judy Collins made them edit out the Send in the Clowns bit.  You can still find the original release on vinyl.  This album marks the cross over from regular pop band to a band of conscience and vision.  As such, I expect this album to be remembered for quite some time.
B00003BDXG|3.0|The movie has become very famous due to its extreme violece and little retribution to the characters who commit these acts.  many have said that this caused things such as the Colombine shootings. the people who say this obviously did not get the message of the film but their claim is not completey invalid as tere IS lots of violence in this film. slow minded teenagers might not get the message and just revel in its violence. that out of the way, id have to give thuis movie 3.5 stars if i could. see, i enjoy the biting satire (although at some points rediculous) and the message but quite frankly, this movie gives me a headache. i found it hard to focus on anything happening while Stone switched from black and white, to color, to grainy 70's style color, to stock footage, to negative colors, to odd camera angles and warped lenses. this complete bombardment of the sense may have been good IN MODERATION and with a purpose. i would understand if they were on drugs (ala Fear And Loathing) but they're not constanlty on drugs. sometimes it works as to portray it as on televsion but the constant change is mind numbing to say the least. ...
0385505833|2.0|I have read every book Grishman has written. Although a deviation from his lawyer tales, the book lacks depth. An OK Christmas story, but a book that really left me flat.  I expect more from Grisham.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I've always been a long time Prince fan, but this album took me WAY back to the feeling I had when I first fell in love with his music (when I bought Sign O The Times). The Rainbow Children is a LOVELY cd. Lush, beautiful, spiritual, uplifting, jazzy, funky, and downright awesome. It pains me that none of these songs are played on the radio right now...but I'm so glad that I bought this CD. If you love REAL music, you will fall in love with this CD.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I have always liked what I heard of 'No Doubt' on the radio, so when this cd came out I bought their three latest at once. What a good thing! They are all solid albums, with Rock Steady being the best. My musical taste is all over the place, with it's roots firmly in 80's new wave and dance, a dose of 60's rock for flavor, and a little of everything in between. Rock steady is refreshing, danceable, and all I seem to want to play since I bought it over a month ago. Simple songs that are infectious. Nothing heavy for my mind or ears, when everyting else out in the world these days seems so heavy and serious.My kids, 5 and 8, love it too!<BR>Add it to your collection today!
020161622X|5.0|This is an excellant book for the experienced programmer or the newcomer.  It is loaded with many tips on how to become a good programmer and keeping your code error free.  As the book says, it will not teach you how to program, but it will lay the groundwork for you to become a complete, well rounded programmer.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I just grabbed this CD the other day, after hearing &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; on the radio, and I was really impressed. I thought SCIENCE and Make Yourself were both quite good, but I didn't buy Morning View because I'd heard bad things. None of those bad things are true, though, since the album is awesome. &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; and &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; are both real rockers, and &quot;11am,&quot; &quot;Just a Phase,&quot; and &quot;Mexico&quot; are all amazing songs that show the lighter side of incubus. It's definitely apparent that Brandon this singer has gone through some trouble with a lady friend, especially because he hasn't talked about women nearly as much as he does on the album. He sings the classic songs of a broken hearted man, however, but gives it the interesting twist that only Incubus can. I can't wait to hear these songs live as soon as I can.
B00005NC66|5.0|This is a great movie. See this movie
B00005JGAF|5.0|I got into the ramones in the late middle 70's when music was the pits and then I heard Rocket to Russia. I think that it is one of Rock's best albums made both in beat and vocals. I think it is a well written album and signifies the idea that punk was fun yet political in nature.<BR>I highly reccomend this album as well as the Live album,anthology which is a good chronilogical representation and pleasent Dreams.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is a refreshing CD by a female artist who's not packaged within an inch of her life and composed largely by plastic surgeons. Dido has a beautiful voice and intelligent, memorable lyrics - the song 'Hunter' alone is worth buying this for. Real music still wins, in spite of the boy bands and would-be divas.
6301777387|4.0|This is undoubtedly a very funny movie. The story of a disobedient MASH unit at an army field hospital during the Korean War, it can be a perfect companion to Joseph Heller's Catch-22 for it's parody of war with paradoxes and irony. My particular favorite scene is the one were an intimate moment between an army major (Robert Duvall) and a army field nurse (Sally Kellerman) is broadcast live on radio at the base (That is also how the nurse gets the nickname \\"Hot Lips\\"). However, some parts of this movie were just a little weird. One particular example is when the base dentist wants to commit suicide. He does so with a black capsule sitting down in a coffin as other friends of his crowd around and say good by to him while the song \\"Suicide is Painless\\" is sung. Another is the famous scene where the tent goes up around where \\"Hot Lips\\" is taking a shower. <br />Nevertheless, while insanely weird, often stupid and with some graphic surgeries and other \\"activities\\" at the hospital, this is still a great movie. The three leads for one thing (Donald Sutherland, Tom Skerritt and Elliott Gould) are hilarious. And the various other supporting characters add to an already colorful mix. Recommended, but not for everyone.
B000001DTM|5.0|Vintage, wonderful U2. I hadn't listened to this for a long time, picked it up the other day and got re-addicted. I can't even begin to pick favourites or any such thing - it's U2, and I love it all.
B00005QDW1|1.0|Gwen has gone from lyrics like &quot;Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin', so please stop explaining, don't tell me cause it hurts&quot; to &quot;All the girl wanna get with the boys, and the boys really like it&quot;.  No matter what she says, Gwen is not the same.
0446310786|5.0|This is simply one of the best American novels ever written. Ms. Lee brings you deftly into the small town of Maycomb during the depression era, and captivates with a story that still holds significance today. A truely great novel!
B00003XB8K|1.0|I find this album, with its cliche and anthemic melodies, to be an insult to anyone with intelligence.  Buy at your own risk!
B00005JKES|5.0|Yes, the pilot is missing. But it is a PILOT. The pilot is not considered part of the first season for any show. And besides, you can easily buy the pilot off of Amazon.<br />Now on the actual DVD itself...incredible. This is probably one of the best dvds released so far. The picture quality is amazing,  better than when it was originally aired. The sound is equally good; the dialogue is very easy to understand.<br />There are a ton of special features, all good (except for the stupid owner of the restaurant...gag). One can spend hours with the character web. I was made happy with the inclusion of the Log Lady introductions, (from the Bravo airings).<br />What I found the most impressing was the art directing for the dvd itself. The menus are beautiful, the packaging is beautiful, all anticpating the beauty of the series itself. Speaking of the series, I don't think I need to say that the show is the best TV series ever made, and Lynch and Frost are geniuses. <br />So overall, you get your money's worth. There are enough special features to make anyone happy, great packaging and design, and the excellent series itself. Get over the missing pilot; you can easily find it elsewhere.
B00000064G|5.0|I am a boy, 14 years. And this music has tuched my heart.<BR>His music is pure and so good that it should be the best album ever with his other records. I found out abou Nick Drake 2 years ago and sins then i could not hear any music ore other beats than this man himself. It is so good that you will never go tiered of it after a week. You will hear again and again.<BR>This album is just he and his gitar just one little piano in Pink Moon. Every trac is different you will soon found out one favourite song. Mine is fly on Time of no reply a very good album. After his death. <BR>Pink moon is the record of his death. I think he just song it to be done with al his songs. This you can hear in place to be, from the mornig and parasite. From the mornig is the suite on his album. A recomed that the hearer should be over 30, becouse of it depresive music. The Songwriter who got never famous.
0446525537|5.0|I bought this book one day because I thought instead of watching the movie first I would read the book. I am so glad I did this is my first Nicholas Sparks book that I have read. I read this book in less than a day, I feel in love with Landon along with Jamie. It made me think of when I was in school and how we all as humans take others forgranted and never give them enough respect. This book made me get mad, laugh, cry and not just cry weep all the way through the last 2 chapters of the book. It was an amazing heart warming story of Respect, Friendship, and most of all True Love! I would in courage everyone to read this book. The next day I went out and bought all of Nicholas Sparks books and I must say I can't put them down. I read The Notebook in one day-Wonderful and Then Message In A Bottle-also very good. Right now I am reading The Rescue and it looks like It to will be read in one day. A Walk To Remember, is still my favourite.....at this moment.
B00000ILDF|4.0|Alien 3 had mixed thoughts when it hit theaters back in 1992. People were not sure what to make out of the alien trilogy's latest installement, probably because it was so dark and gloomy, much like David Fincher's other thriller 'seven'. This is most likely the biggest reason why people did not like it. However Alien 3 is a good film, but had that awkward disadvantage of having to live up to 2 of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made.<BR> The plot returns to the first installemnts horror, run-away screaming style, and a lot less action than Aliens, considering Ripley and her team of inmates have absolutely no weapons whatsoever and must rely on cunning ability to ultimately trap the creature. In the midst of all these goings on, Rpley discovers she has an alien inside of her ready to burst out and bring down all hell. To make matters worse for our heroine Ripley she discovers that a spaceship will soon be arriving to pick her up, and her precious host so that they can use it for their bio-weapons division,witch threatens to erase all of her earlier attempts to destroy the creature. This leads Ripley to not only take action against the monster but herself aswell.<BR> This movie is fantastic in conveing the mood in which the film takes place, a dangerous maximum security prison, in wich the alien lurkes and picks off inmates one by one. The acting is also spot on by Weaver, naturally, but rather becomes a more frightened and 'less tough' hero, like she was in its predessecors.<BR> Ultimately, a fine and disturbingly gory addition to the trilogy, with good directing and spot on acting. Oh yeah, i forgot to mention the creature is as vicious as ever and fans will enjoy how it runs on walls on all fours(with camera as aliens point of view), witch is really quite cool. A good film, if not quite as good as the more satisfying originals.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This is probably one of the most powerful live CDs I have ever heard.  Refreshing and thrilling twists on already classic tunes from one of the New Age Divas.  Although we are all pining a bit for some new material from one of Canada's finest, this album is so well done that it almost can be classed as new material.  Her studio versions are just as stunning but different, these renditions have a certain edge and resonance not heard in her studio stuff - perhaps a little less reflective and dreamy than her studio versions and more in your face.  \\"Possession\\" and \\"Building a Mystery\\" are packed with energy and attitude.  It's all good and you won't be disappointed.  One of my top ten desert island discs in the live category.  This will spend many, many hours in your CD Player - trust me!!!!!
0380002930|5.0|I chose this book because it was on a list of classics and near-classics.  When I first saw it, I was dismayed--it looked so long!  But this tale was so riveting that I finished it within a few days--even staying up into the early morning to keep reading it.  Please don't be turned off by the fact that the book is about rabbits!  (I almost was.)  You will discover much about yourself and about human nature through reading this amazing book.  It's well worth the time you will spend reading it.  I went right out and got the sequel, &quot;Tales from Watership Down.&quot;
0440224764|5.0|The Partner is a great book by Grisham, who i think is a genius when it comes to writing.  its well written.  There are all sorts of twists.  Its a legal thriller which everyone should read
B0000004V2|5.0|I really can't add anything that hasn't been said already on here by others.  Just pick this disc up, its absolutely brilliant music.  The best example of Madchester ever!! One of the most influential Brit rock albums and a classic.
B00005U1YO|3.0|The title track, Come with Us is amazing, the drum rolls keep building, there are 2 other excellent tracks too, but the title track is well worth buying the cd.
B00000016K|5.0|There are two main types of songs on this album, the hard blues-rock and what I'd like to call \\"Golden Age\\" classic rock. I pick this moniker, because, even 35 years ago, the lyrics of rock songs on this album took my imagination into places hardly any other rock or even folk lyrics would go . . . for instance, back to the fabled Golden Age [cradled around the region of the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean ] before the advent of modern civilization. On other songs, even when the imagery hedges into the obscure and surreal, it stimulates both the interior personal and the archetypal within us, as well as the larger mythical and universal regions of our collective psyches. These songs, because of the beauty, passion and confident inventiveness of their melodies and the surety of their performance make it easy to believe in what is being said. The songs are large in scope, sometimes beautiful, other times strange, but always have more than a bit of the power of deeply running, ancient spirit in them. And they are extremely well executed and well produced.<br />I'd call \\"White Room\\" a rock masterpiece in miniature.<br />\\"Passing the Time\\" and \\"As You Said\\" are largely acoustic numbers, both very poetic and moving.<br />If you feel that \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" is just a humorous or novelty song, please pay more attention to the lyrics.<br />\\"Those Were the Days\\" and \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\", are the main Golden Age rockers previously referred to. These continually remind us of things we wish we'd not ever forgotten.<br />Since I'm not so much the blues aficionado nor the hard rocker, I don't contend to be able to judge the blues numbers [\\"Sitting . . .\\", \\"Politician\\", \\"Born . . .\\", and the songs of disk 2] as graciously as some would. But I give all three of the studio songs at least 4 stars. As for the live tracks, I'll let those [who are more tuned into that hard, bluesy arena] perform the task of judging them.
B00005QW4K|5.0|This is a great version of this great film, what you get is 96 minutes thats 15 minutes more than the original and although the film quality goes to hell in parts it is still a must have for any true evil dead fan. The stuff they have added in is great and really adds to the entire film, making it better in my opinion.  Plus you get a funny as hell commentary track, four never before seen deleted scenes, and the original ending is still there.  For what they are asking as a going price, it is worth picking up and hell do what I did and get the other special edition with the making of documentary on it.  Great movie = great buy.
B00005AAFS|5.0|If you listened to \\"mutter\\" then you'll soon see why americas<BR>crazed about the six german masters of dark metal. They spawned their success with \\"Herzeleid\\" now making their forth album the best.

0375507507|5.0|\\"My God, I am the WRONG color.\\" This is one of the brilliant flashes of wry insight delivered up by Alexandra Fuller in this harrowing, enchanting, beautifully rendered account of a childhood lived in the waning days of British colonial Africa. Ms. Fuller has a keen, ever alert eye for myriad vivid details of existence in this exotic tale of one family's survival in some of the most remote and inhospitable places on earth, set against the backdrop of a civil war spinning out of control. Her family manages (somehow) to eke out a living (often hand to mouth) in the melting, oven-breath heat of withering African scrub-land. The picaresque landscape turns out to be every bit as hostile and deadly as the threat from rebels.<br />Honest and unflinching, the author's spellbinding account leaps off the page and graps the reader, pulling one irresistably into a succession of spine-thrilling, rib-tickling scenes: Eye-Burning Hot. Mine Fields. Leopard Poachers. White Racism. Gun-Totting Children. The reader sees what Ms. Fuller sees--sees it all, hears it all, with all the symphonic virtuosity of a passionate, peerless raconteuse.<br />[Sound Track] [Fade-in] Soft cadence of Cape turtledoves, \\"Work-HARD-er, work-HARD-er.\\" The booming bells of Big Ben crackle listlessly from a makeshift radio mounted, ignominiously, in the branches of an acacia tree and attached to a long tail of wire that requires hours of spinning its aerial web around the arbors of nearby trees. Over here, against a nearby khaki bush, an African girl (nicknamed \\"Burning Piggy\\" by darker-skinned classmates) stands out like a large marshmallow (her words), ready to return today to boarding school in neighboring Zambia. At the frontier, in a moment charged with high drama and even higher comedy, she tries not to get herself shot by an extortionist posing as a customs officer who wields an AK-47 like a tennis racket. Later, crossing the narrow bridge spanning the Zambezi River that heralds her entry into Zambia,she scans the water excitedly for hippos, announcing, \\"If I weren't going back to school today, I would be in heaven.\\" [Fade-out]<br />Whether Ms. Fuller is recounting a bollixed border crossing, an awkward meal with half-starving peasants, a wedding braai feeding hundreds, or rebels storming her family's farmhouse--my God, what a mad mad world! \\"Don't Let's Go To The Dogs Tonight\\" is a rare read, a stunning tour-de-force by an exceptionally gifted writer.<br />Pace Ralph Waldo Emerson: I greet Alexandra Fuller at the start of a great career.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I recently purchased a PS2 sometime in January. I also purchased InterAct's 16MB memory card. The card didn't work with any games I own, even after I used the Memory Manager disc. I returned the card and purchased the Sony brand 8MB memory card. I am totally satisfied with this memory card. It is fast, reliable, and the PS2 works great with it. I don't know why I bought a third party brand card. Nyko also makes an 8MB memory card that I have heard works very well with the PS2, but buy the Sony one and rest assured that you won't have to go through any trouble with it. This product is GREAT!
0060977493|5.0|This is the first book I read by Ms.Roy. This Woman is amazing. She has the guts to tell some of the things people don't dare to speak in the Indian society. The book has all the emotions you can name. It is funny and sad.She has a way with language. Her language is simple and eloquent. Hard to believe that this is her first book. The book deals with all the hypocrisies in the Indian society. The thing she had expressed so beautifully is how people decide whom one can love and whom one can not love. I liked the way she describes the caste system. After reading the book, it makes you wonder, if the Indian community will ever emerge from the evilness of the caste system.She has inspired me to do something for the society.
0201485672|2.0|I rate the book with two stars because the introductory part of the book brings you some good ideas and thoughts. From that point, the reference material is too simple.
B00005JHCP|4.0|This is a very good video - a great adaption of the book (although some bits were left out, that's understandable) and with good acting all round. I also agree that Daniel Radcliffe did a much better job here than in Harry Potter - I think it was this that gave him that &quot;magical quality&quot; people mention. Costumes and settings were brilliant.
0743216458|5.0|I read this book after watching the first few episodes of the HBO miniseries based on it.  I was so moved by the book that I have taken it upon myself to learn more about WWII and take personal histories of members of my family.  You felt as if you knew the men that are interviewed for this book and how many men there were that didn't come back and have a chance to tell their stories.  What a great generation they all are.  Both of my grandfathers fought in WWII.  Neither have a lot to say about what they did and what happened.  Sharing this book with them has released stories even thier wives didn't know.  Stories that would be forever lost.  The 506th exudes brotherhood-what it means to truly love others and sacrifice.  Under intense, unimaginable conditions, they came together for the better good.  I would highly recommend reading this book along with any others by Ambrose.
0192838679|5.0|The luckless Queen of France kept a copy of this book, albeit that she had to put a 'false' cover on it for fear of ridicule - one would have thought that she would have been immune. And no wonder that she risked doing this, as this novel is nothing short of extraordinary! It contains every element of the best soap opera - love, hate, betrayal, murder, illicit sex, and every other vice that one associates with that decadent French era. Ah, to be a time traveller and meet these fully fashioned 3-dimensional characters. So go ahead and stamp your passport for a trip into the past, and read a book that is as deep and rich as a 4 layer chocolate cake. You won't gain an ounce, but you will be dizzy from the passion! Bon Voyage and Bon Appetite!
0449208109|5.0|I found this tale about the Ibo people in Nigeria, just before and during the arrival of white Christian missionaries and English colonialism, a compelling and dramatic read. Achebe does a superb job of appearing to remain outside the story while infusing it with deep sense of tradition and weaving a rich cultural tapestry. The characters created by Achebe to populate the villages of the Ibo people are so thoroughly well done that it seems he is relating an historical, rather than allegorical, tale. The story is seen through the eyes of Okonkwo, a proud and powerful figure in his village. His life unfolds as a parallel to the life of the Ibo people as a whole. A magnificent novel, beautifully yet simply written. Highly recommended.
B0000020C4|5.0|This recording is a &quot;must have&quot; for anyone who has seen the show or heard the music.  An all-star cast drawn from outstanding performances throughout the world, this recording not only captures the mood and feeling of the performance, but also treats the listener to the ending of the performance when a number of Valjeans sing in their native language.  I also recommend the VHS recording for the visuals that are absent in the CD.  My favorite of the London Cast, Original Broadway Cast, and the Original French Concept Album, all of which are in my collection.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|Tomb Raider is the kind of movie you can watch while reading a book and not miss a thing.  Lara Croft originated in video games as a wild, sassy heroine with amazing acrobatic skill and two Desert Eagles to back her up, and her games supercharged that industry.  The idea for the movie was to cross Indiana Jones with James Bond, throw in a little bit of Batman's dark side and humor from The Mummy, and populate the lead role with a sexy, academy award-winning actress, Angelina Jolie.  You would think that formula couldn't lose, but the final serving is a mess.  I prefer the video games, even the later ones.<br />Director Simon West approached this film as if he were shooting a commercial or music video.  Every single shot is some high-concept, slow-mo dutch angle that lovingly follows our heroine on her adventure: we lovingly watch Lara open the door, then lovingly watch her close the door, that kind of thing.  It gets old fast.  The plot, too, is full of exotic locations and references to the films I mentioned above, and nothing is missing but some logic to make any sense of it.  Major plot points are lost in the glamor, and the endless sexy shots of our heroine and her hapless foes.  Enemies suddenly become friends for no sensible reason, and the major plot-twist is so uninspiring that if you blink you'll miss it.  The CGI enemies for Lara Croft look terrible and are about as entertaining as a barrel full of Jar-Jar Binks'.  The dialog is horrendous.  \\"My ignorance amuses me\\" is a real line that is actually heard 3 times, and it was just as dumb as it sounds.   I don't think the characters were even listening to each other, just say cool-sounding things to match the empty shine of the entire over-paid mess.  The onscreen meeting of offscreen fatherand dauther John Voight and Jolie is touching, dispite the fact that they don't have much to say to each other.<br />I admire the daring of the filmmakers to place Lara Croft on equal footing with any male enemy she faces- Croft simply karate chops 'em to the ground exactly as if she were a man, no dirty tricks, just pure power and skill.  Unfortunately, Angelina Jolie isn't believably as a nimble acrobatic kung-fu master.  Jolie DOES play Croft with a large does of sensual sexuality, but she throws a kick like a turle, and the wire work in this move is terrible, nothing as interesting as The Matrix.  Jolie doesn't look graceful, she looks clumbsy.<br />THE DVD - is a good one.  The making of documentary is from HBO, which means that it's about 3 stars out of 5.  There is an audio commentary and lots of little featurettes about various fxs and training for Jolie.  U2's excellent video is a must see.
B00005N9CV|3.0|For this cd Romance was in the air. It was all around and around the listner. What a wonderful feeling. Awesome!<br />For this project, Diana's voice sounded great. It was real smooth and sedudicative. It never sounded better.<br />The repertoire that Diana performed was a good one. I personally liked most of the tunes.<br />For the most part the accompaniment was a good one. The jazz ensemble and orcheatra did a good job on the basic songs, but I felt like there were some problems with the length of the songs.<BR>It appears that there was too much wasted time on most of the songs. For example on a lot of the songs the orchestra played a long introduction before the melody every appeared. On some songs the orchestra played a long play down after the melody had long ago ended. I felt like this took a lot away from the basic song, this unneeded improvising.<br />Despite the problems described above, I still liked this cd.<br />Please do your sweetheart a favor and buy this cd. She will love you to death for it.
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth is definitely the most talented band in extreme metal today. At first I was sceptical about this album being good because I heard that a lot of their songs were 10+ minutes long. I thought that the songs would get boring after a while....How far I was from this truth. I found myself listening to all 60 some minutes of this CD and listening to it over and over and over. This band is incredible! The lead singer's growls are nothing special but when he does his clean voice it is so awesome. Every song on this album is a masterpiece. I dont want to stereotype metal or anything like that but I think I have to: YOU DONT LIKE METAL IF YOU DONT LIKE OPETH. Thats all I got to say, later Opeth worshippers
0671891634|5.0|It is a great book and thanks Peter for sharing his exciting and valuable experience with his fellow Americans.  I have read &quot;Learn to earn&quot;, &quot;One Up on Wall Street&quot; and &quot;Beating the Street&quot; and am looking forward to Peter's future books.  <br />I would like to know in MORE DETAIL Peter's experience in analysing specific companies(e,g, how he evaluated a specific balance sheet etc).  This will benefit the amatuer investors a great deal.
B000002H97|2.0|This is the album that Metallica decided to abandon their thrash roots and go all radio-rock and everything. If you are an avid radio rock listener you probably love this album and all that but I just dont like it. Some of the songs are decent but nothing special. There is no classic 8 minute long metal anthems on here like \\"master of puppets\\" or \\"creeping death\\". What we get is 4 minute long, slow radio friendly rock. Well if thats your bag me giving this album a 2 star review wont change your mind but I just thought I should let my opinion be known
B000002U82|4.0|Hey, Ive heard it a gazillion times but that's no reason not to tell a new generation of kiddies not to slip this into their Discmans, smoke a little something funny and discover the orchestral grandeur of Pink Floyd. Be forewarned, though, a dollar spent on Floyd will become ten, youll want to hit up their entire extensive discography, no doubt. Three distinct stages of musical growth make each record fun to fit into their development from acid/punk pioneers, to progressive sculptors of side long slabs of gauche variations on a theme, to the conduit to the raging paranoia and psychosis of Roger Waters.
B00003CWTI|1.0|A year has passed since I saw Magnolia on DVD, and yet I still harken back on it, remembering how much I utterly despised it.  The shame of Magnolia is that it is clearly a film where the director had full control, and yet he goes so far overboard that you worry no studio will ever trust a director on his or her own ever again.<br />I loathe Magnolia.  Short of Caligula it could be the single worst film ever made, and that's saying an awful lot.  Why is it so terrible?  Let's list the reasons:<br />1) Everyone in the film is either insane, miserable, dying, or some combination thereof.  While this is certainly not a crime, it is a crime when the characters fail to be interesting in any way.  Apart from the characters played by John C. Reilly (who gives a good performance) and Philip Seymour Hoffman, none of the characters evoke any sympathy from the audience.  Most deserve their misery.<br />2) The introduction of Magnolia is brilliant.  It documents stories of amazing coincidence that have occurred in real life, and then tries to establish freak coincidence as the theme of the film.  The film doesn't even come close to fulfilling this.  Characters are vaguely connected, but with none of the panache of films like Short Cuts and Pulp Fiction.  The film is secretly a mess.  Characters act without any rhyme or reason.  They meet because the plot forces them to.  They're related because the film wants to amplify each characters' problems.  None of it works.<br />3) The film's ending is so utterly vain in trying to tell you how biblically important the film is, when all it really is really is a device to end the film because PT Anderson clearly couldn't pull any of it together at the finale.  No issues are resolved.  No character has undergone any kind of important shift.  The ending is abrupt, fantastical, and ultimately stupid.<br />4) The characters played by Julianne Moore, Melora Walters, and Tom Cruise are all so grating, so self-involved and irritating that you root for the death more than their salvation.  Particularly Julianne Moore's character, who's such a worthless shrew it almost makes you pine for the friendliness of Jar Jar Binks.<br />5) The soundtrack of Aimee Mann songs are very good songs on their own.  But in this film they're so earnest, so incredibly serious, that they practically suffocate the audience.  There's no levity at any moment in the film, and at over three hours, it makes viewing the whole film in its entirely an impossible task.<br />6) The film has no basis in reality.  A woman does at least $10,000 worth of cocaine every two seconds and manages somehow to be able to go out on a date with a POLICE OFFICER.  Tom Cruise plays a sexual motivational speaker.  Has anyone ever done this?  Has anyone ever been successful at this?  With a ponytail no less?<br />7) Anderson throws in every \\"issue\\" he can he to give the film more dramatic heft.  It's like a bad Party of Five episode: sex, drugs, booze, pills, incest, death, divorce, cancer.  You're shocked he hasn't tossed in a leper by the end for the sake of it.<br />8) Related to the above, the film has so sense of dramatic subtlety.  Important character traits have to be spelled out in huge capital letters.  Tom Cruise's character is SECRETLY INSECURE.  Melora Walters' character is an ADDICT.  Nothing is hinted at.  It's stuck right in your face with all the grace of George Wendt figure skating.<br />9) The film is endless.  Three hours have never felt so long.  It makes you yearn for the dentists' chair.<br />10) The film is astonishly self-important and arrogant.  If you need any evidence, you needn't look any further than the look of disgust on PT Anderson's face when his film failed to win a best Screenplay Oscar.  The film feels constantly like it's doing you a favor by giving you all this precious insight into people who are essentially idiots.  In fact, the film is based on the Idiot Plot.  There wouldn't be a film if any of the characters had abrain in their heads.  Instead, they do stupid things and then wonder why their lives are so miserable.<br />Let it be known that I enjoyed PT Anderson's last two films.  They were tightly constructed, entertaining, and always made sure to not take themselves too seriously.  That goes out the window with Magnolia.  It's one of the most selfish, annoying, and wannabe precious films ever made.  It's awful, and don't let the parade of hypnotized critics tell you differently.  This movie [stinks].
0767802659|5.0|I think by far this was put together very well, You can tell the research was done on this in some aspects such as the boot camp which it shows a good sense of realism. Everything that leads up to the actual combat scenes is a wonderful buildup of staging. I say this was very well done. It had brought back memories of my high school years and enlisting into service right after with some buddies of mine. Most movies and books that depict war usually revolves around fighting humans here, but this opens your eyes to the possibility of something even more terrible happening. This movie deserves a sequel.
B00005RHGL|4.0|Apart from obvious classics (e.g. \\"The Godfather\\") it's almost impossible to find a non-comedy film you can watch repeatedly without tiring of.  Tombstone qualifies for reasons I can't explain.  Maybe it's the meat-and-potatoes Western quality to it.  Good guys are bada--es.  Bad guys are scum.  Good guys shoot up the bad guys real good while delivering incredibly satisfying lines.<br />But the more likely reason is Val Kilmer's performance.  Kilmer's never given a better performance and never will.  His Doc Holliday is easily one of the coolest, I-wish-I-was-like-that-guy characters in history.  His lines are endlessly quotable.  His Southern drawl a thing a beauty.  And whenever his character is off screen you wish he was there.  It's an outstanding performance, and how it missed an Academy Award is an utter mystery.<br />But Tombstone has other pleasures, guilty or otherwise.  You get to see Kurt Russell finally puts his steely blue eyes to good use.  The girl from Fletch plays an opium addict.  Every character has unbelievably cool facial hair.  And you get to play \\"Spot the Obscure Celebrity\\" during the entire film.  Is this Jason Priestly?  Was that Frank Stallone?  Wyatt Earp III?  A fat Billy Bob Thornton?  Charlton Heston?  Robert Mitchum narrating?  Yup, they're all there.  And they're good!<br />Granted, at times Tombstone resembles those \\"Beef, it's what's for dinner\\" ads.  And adding Dana Delaney as a love interest is really only a half-hearted attempt to keep the ladies interested in a film driven by oceans of testosterone.  But there are so few films made like this anymore that all that seems fresh.  It's so old it's new.<br />But Kilmer's is the thing you'll stick around for.  And the Special DVD makes the film look even better.  Fun sutff.
B00003CXN4|2.0|When I watched this it reminded me what I thought of The Assassin (Bridget Fonda). In that case an absolute classic movie Nikita was destroyed with a mind numbing version for the US audience. It's happened again here with Traffik becoming remade as Traffic. Traffic won all the awards and took all the money buy you owe it to yourself to watch Traffik, the original.
B00003CWTI|1.0|A year has passed since I saw Magnolia on DVD, and yet I still harken back on it, remembering how much I utterly despised it.  The shame of Magnolia is that it is clearly a film where the director had full control, and yet he goes so far overboard that you worry no studio will ever trust a director on his or her own ever again.<br />I loathe Magnolia.  Short of Caligula it could be the single worst film ever made, and that's saying an awful lot.  Why is it so terrible?

0446678430|5.0|To all those who would criticize Robert Kiyosaki for not being a great writer, you have missed the point. I started investing in real estate in 1990 after having watched those late night TV commercials. I had no money at the time, but found a way to get my first place, then my second, etc. I have a backround as a musician, and no degree. Speaking as someone with 8 rental houses today, I can tell you I agree with 90% of what Kiyosaki says. If you want the nuts and bolts of real estate, you need to keep reading and studying.<BR>Kiyosaki writes for overall financial perspective, and his overall perspective is correct.<BR>There are many ways to get started in real estate, and each works best depending on location, timing, and your individual temperment and abilities.<BR>I would caution you, don't sell the message short because you're not crazy about the messenger's style.
B00003W1QB|5.0|Though this album is rather expensive, and the second CD only comes with a few tracks, it's a must-have for true fans. \\"Power Move\\" is to Samba what \\"It Began in Afrika\\" is to tribal rhythms; and \\"Flashback\\" is simply amazing. It's incredible. Basically, if you worry about how much it is, this album is not for you. P.S.: mine didn't come boxed--it's a two-CD case, the width of a normal one.
B000002J1M|4.0|I owned this album, and I love it.  Phil Collins' drum<BR>work is splendid, as is Gabriel's lead vocals and <BR>Banks' synthesizer work.  I especially love Hackett's<BR>classical nylon solo on &quot;Horizon's&quot;.  A must-have for<BR>Genesis lovers.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|...This movie took a chance...of either being as terrific as it is,or being a complete and total waste(which it most definately wasn't!)Baz Luhrmann is an amazing director and deserves every single award he gets nominated for and the ones he doesn't too!Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman...hmmmm...on that subject,how many actors and actresses can sing,dance,and act at the same time?!?!?Not many I can tell you that.The two sing great together.Their voices create a sound from the heavens when combined, and even alone.When McGregor sang \\"Your Song\\", I just about melted into my couch.The whole sugery sweetness of his voice just got to me. And Kidman!!She can perform,more than likely,any song,any time,any place. And the love song,\\"Come What May\\"...ahhh...Beautiful!I cried at the end where she starts singing the sacred song to him and he believes she still loves him. The chemistry between them made me believe the two were actually a couple before I looked up McGregor on the internet(I totally fell in love with him after the movie), and found out he was happily married.The plot may be kind of confusing at times,but if you have a quick mind,you'll understand that it's an imotional love story that will be cherished for years to come, and the people that don't like it are deadbeats!:)
B00005QZ7U|3.0|If I could, I'd give this movie 1 star for the first half, and 5 stars for the second half. <br />The first half of the movie was absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. Styled like a hyper MTV music video, the actors behave like demented live action Warner Brother's cartoons. Did no one tell them that only cartoon characters can get away with this? <br />While Baz Luhrman excels in tragic stories, he has no comic sensibilities. In the first part of the movie he strains to be comic, and each of these hyper comic moments falls flat and took me out of the story. Strangely the commentary suggests that this was his intent!? Though their mantra was \\"everything in the service of the story,\\" they did a lot of other things visually and musically in the first half that completely distracted from the story.<br />Having a strong urge to leave, but remembering the astonishing final scene in his Romeo + Juliet, I hung in there hoping to catch a few visual gems. About half way though the movie my patience finally paid off, and it began to take the story seriously and become an astonishing work of cinematic art. I was completely swept away by the story, and everything worked in complete service to the story, I mean everything from the acting, dancing, singing, cinematography and editing. <br />In the end I absolutely loved it, but it was also the worst movie ever. To reconcile my love and revulsion for this movie, I've split the movie in half. When I show it to friends, I give them I little prologue to establish the story and start with the second half, and they love it too.
0385505833|5.0|We've all been there and wished we could do what the Kranks did (or didn't do). This quick read is incredibly entertaining and describes what we've all felt from time to time. His ability to spin the tale with humor is a new side to Grisham, one that I would like to see him pursue since he's obviously very talented at doing it.

B000002UJQ|5.0|What can i say about this UK band, but OUTSTANDING. OK Computer, takes there talent to newer grounds.I'll begin with the sounds, here Radiohead has construted pure magic, combinding Electronic sounds with an Orchestra-like feeling. Take Karma Police(my personal Favourite) i think it's the panio thats is driven with such pureity, lead singer Thom Yorke, has that Hauting yet Innocent voice that has driven this band to success and in this song you can see why this band is ahead of its time... If your not familiar with the sounds of Radiohead begin with Ok Computer.This album has a Construction of many feelings and passions that have many bands failed to deliver constantly in the 90's...
B00005RHGK|5.0|This is not another teen movie knock-off. This movie drew me in and scared me to no end. It reminded me alot of Texas Chainsaw Massarce and that was a scary movie. The acting was really good, especially the boy. Loved his facial expressions of terror. Really good movie. Very scary.
0792844882|4.0|were it not for the liner notes and the extra features included with the dvd, you might think that verhoeven and ezsterhaus made showgirls as some kind of quasi=sick joke, giving the world what can be easily classified as the campiest, worst-acted, thinly written cliche film of all time.  but, as the notes and features show, they really thought this was going to be a powerful film... little did they know what they'd produce.<br />if you like camp, and are willing to endure some nasty sexuality, then showgirls is the movie for you.<br />elizabeth berkley deserves a special kind of oscar for her atrocious overacted portrayal of nomi, the girl who throws her french fries when bothered and loves to storm out of rooms, thrash naked in pools, and stare blankly from behind her clown-face of makeup.<br />gina gershon is the big-mouthed (literally), aggressively bisexual 'star', crystal connors, of the hottest 'show' in vegas.  she loves saying 'darlin', licking her lips, and attempting to dance in her show.<br />the production numbers are hilarious; rotating between pagan orgies around a crystal-erupting volcano and a leather and s&m motorcycle kidnapping number.<br />the movie throws out every cliche in the business and no one, and i mean NO ONE turns in a believably acted performance. ...  it ruins what is otherwise a flawlessly perfect bad film.
B00003CX8J|2.0|The X-Men comics were one of the richest mines for a movie franchise among all comic books.  A complex central issue dealing with alienation, bodily image, race, prejudice, plus a cast of troubled but iconic characters -- what more could a movie want?<br />Well, for one thing, a script.  An appropriate cast.  Performances.  X-Men the movie had high aspirations, but so many of its pieces were just flat-out wrong.<br />Granted, I had scoffed at the new image the movie had crafted for these characters, especially Cyclops' oversized goggles.  But the costumes turned out to work better than I thought in this movie.  No, the problems with X-Men are casting and script.  It's no wonder that the one actor who rises beautifully to the challenge is (then) newcomer Hugh Jackman.  Though a little young for the character of Wolverine, his great physique and feral presence suited the movie terrifically.  But the script offers him nary a chance to really craft something immortal, like Michael Keaton in Batman.  Simply put, the script is Thin with a capital T.  The central plot gets lost midway through the movie amidst all the exposition about Professor X's school.  This was necessary, but it was placed in the wrong part of the movie and resulted in the main plot grinding to a halt.  After the brilliant juggling trick he did with the kaleidoscopic plot of The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer disappoints in this movie, not quite able to make the mishmash screenplay work.  The characters of Cyclops, Jean Grey, Professor X, Storm and Rogue all became completely one-dimensional facades, which worked contrary to the movie's message that there's more to mutants than meets the eye.  Wolverine's memory loss is given no payoff.  Senator Kelly's melting trick (as Magneto says, &quot;Are you sure you saw what you saw?&quot;) is not explained, as if the screenwriter simply forgot to wrap up that strand of plot.<br />And then there's the actors.  With the sole exception of Jackman, everybody looks tremendously uncomfortable.  The wonderful Ian McKellan is given little to chew on, plus a ridiculous-looking helmet and costume to match.  James Marsden as Cyclops looks like one of the Coneheads.  Famke Janssen is about ten years too old to be playing Jean Grey, failing along the way to project any of the charisma of the character, making us question why in hell Wolverine is so enamoured with her. (...because the comic books said so.)  Halle Berry is embarrassing as Storm, manifesting not a  shred of the elegance and intelligence of a wind goddess.  Anna Paquin as Rogue looks all right, but never probes into Rogue's psychological pains and instead comes off as a pure victim.  The villains fare better by virtue of being simpler:  Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is lithe (though practically mute) as shapeshifter Mystique, and Ray Parks (Darth Maul in Star Wars Episode I) dazzles with a combination of acrobatic displays and mechanical effects as Toad.<br />I think I would have questioned the suitability of the actors to their roles a lot less if the story had simply moved along better.  As it is, I get neither the satisfaction of watching a good comic-book adaptation nor a good sci-fi/action movie.
0060987464|4.0|The author of this book is Marilyn Manson with Neil Strauss. The title is The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, and it was published by ReganBooks. There are other books about the author, but not written by him. The author is a musican and his music is readily available at most music outlets.<br />As he describes, in his own words, goths would most likely enjoy this book. People that are upset with the world and don't understand it. People looking for an outlet to let out their fantasies and for people who want to read about a famous rock star.<br />The book has 3 main parts: When I was a Worm, Deformography, and How I got my Wings. There are several chapters under those parts. The is an autobiography, and it starts out in his childhood and continues until 1998. When I was a Worm is referring to himself in his childhood and the things that happened which influenced how he is now. Deformography consists of when he went to Florida and started a band, and experimented. Lastly, How I got my Wings is about when he is famous and him struggling and coming to himself more.<br />In this book Marilyn is very to the point and describes everything. I wouldn't recommend this book for even a junior high child, high school should be okay. You need an open-mind and look past the make-up and crazy fantasies. If you can see that, he too can be a human being. <br />Overall I enjoyed the book. I didn't know what to quite expect from a rock n roll artist, especially an autobigraphy from Marilyn Manson. So many people have their minds made up about him and have judged him already. After reading this, he's not this evil entity, he's just a person. It also opens your eyes into the perpective of another and you can see the world through different eyes.
B00005RHGK|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Most people watch movies twice because they are good, I watched it twice because I couldn't believe it was that bad. Why this movie was a success in the box office is beyond me. Why is it bad, let me explain. <br />The basic premise of the movie is: brother and sister coming home from college, they almost get run off the road by what turns out to be the title character. After investigating the supposed lair of this creature, they go from the hunting to the hunted. Now that the backdrop is out of the way let me tell you why I hated this film. The first half-hour of the movie is real dry, you'll be scratching your head asking yourself,\\"this is the suspense they were talking about on the back of the box?\\" I don't call almost getting run down suspenseful. I don't ask for characters in horror movies to be smart. I know they have to be somewhat retarded to make the story work but this is going far and beyond the call of duty with these two. <br />My main gripe with the film is that it doesn't explain anything. I don't even think the film's makers predicted it would be successful and spawn a sequel ... I think the film makers realized that people wanted a good monster flick, so they threw this together just to cash in. You never find out what the creature is, where it came from, why it does the thing that it does, why this woman has the psychic ability to know what it is about to do. There are plenty of questions you can think of during the course of this movie. Besides the lack of character development, this movie isn't really scary at all. They try to force scenes in there to make you jump, it's to predictable though. I thought this would be a movie that would get my wife jumping, instead she got bored to death and went to play Boggle. I will give JC this though, the ending rather surprised me, if only the rest of the movie was thought out like the ending. <br />Look, I'm pretty picky. Some people need nor plot or character development to enjoy a movie. Hey it is a horror movie, its only supposed to scare you and make you jump(even though it didn't). Give it a try if you have a rent one get one free card, but I would suggest renting a good thriller such as SE7EN and calling it a day.
0792841344|5.0|I give this film 5 stars when compared to other horror films, not all films.  That said...<br />Phantasm is possibly one of the most frightening and bizarre films ever made.  By modern standards this film should be completely terrible, because anyone else attempting to make a film with the same ingredients would surely screw it up:  grave robbers, walking corpses, shrunken corpses reanimated, mortuaries, a flying sphere with deadly intentions, aliens and/or interdimensional travel, reanimated fingers, and a singing ice cream salesman.  Sound bizarre?  It is.  Does it work?  You better believe it!<br />When I first saw this film I was in college watching it in a friends dorm room on HBO.  In the final scene of the film, I literally tipped the chair over backwards in surprise.  It scared the living daylights out of me.<br />Coscarelli permeates the film with unease.  The viewer is never quite sure if what he is watching is reality or some dream/nightmare world that the characters are being subjected to.  The result is a fine film that delivers on chills and confuses you just enough to allow you to be surprised by events that wouldn't normally go together, but somehow do here.<br />Definitely rent or buy this one!
B000053VAF|5.0|When this film was releasd, it was proclaimed by the Catholic Church as blasphemous.  On the contrary.  The film is a reaffirmation of faith and at the same time, not to be taken seriously.  When GHOSTBUSTERS was released way back in 1984, the hype above the titles claimed, \\"Coming This Summer To Save the World\\".  It got almost the same reaction as this film.  As with GHOSTBUSTERS, DOGMA is a comedy and not scripture.  The film's main plot is about two fallen angels  Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon) who somehow find a loophole to get back to heaven. For this, they must travel to New Jersey where Cardinal Glick (George Carlin) is planning \\"pass through the Church doors and have your sins wiped away automatically\\" day.  However, this loophole can mean the end of the world because it would mean God is not perfect. Along the way, they go on a killing spree.  Then, the voice of God, Metatron (Alan Rickman), recruits Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) to stop the fallen angels and she in turn recruits help along the way.  The funniest of course, are the so-called prohets, Jay and Silent Bob  (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) from all of Smith's movies and Chris Rock as Rufus the 13th and only black Apostle. At the same time, Jason Lee as the demon Azrael is scheming to have the fallen angels succeed. Kevin Smith has done his homework and as a Catholic, knows his catechism. As usual, the Kevin Smith's dialogue is crisp and fun to listen to, and the comedy is right on the money.  Great support all around from Chris Rock, Alan Rickman, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Jason Lee etc... and Selma Hayek is used right for a change. The final battle scene of good vs. the not so evil may be a little graphic, and Alannis Morissette as God may be a little hard to swallow, but this is one of Kevin Smith's slickest movies to date.  The special addition DVD has all the bells and whitsles.
B00003CXWV|2.0|\\"Blow\\" is Ted Demme's attempt to be Martin Scorcese for a couple of hours.<br />Demme borrows so much from Scorcese's style in 'Goodfellas' (the flashbacks with 50's-60's music on the soundtrack; freeze frames and voice over narration) it's as if Scorcese is in the wings shouting instructions.<br />\\"Blow\\" details the story of George Jung, who, growing up watching his hard working father drowning in both a sea of debt  and the constant nagging of a shrewish wife, vows never to experience poverty himself.<br />Jung goes from peddling pot to college kids to become a full fledged drug kingpin doing business with Pablo Escobar and the Colombian cartel.<br />Johnny Depp is a fine actor, but the screenplay doesn't give him all that much to work with...Penelope Cruz as Jung's Colombian wife is gorgeous, but she can't act and when she's emasculating Depp in one particular scene, the result is almost laughable (\\"you are a Poosy!\\").<br />The whole thing leaves you with an empty feeling buoyed by the realization that you've just watched a two hour film about a guy whose chief accomplishments in life were dealing drugs and going to prison.<br />****<br />The DVD package is excellent and includes some worthwhile special features including an interview with the real George Jung and a series of deleted scenes....Depp's more detailed scenes with Escobar, cut from the final print, were superb and if left in, would have given \\"Blow\\" a much needed lift.
B000026258|5.0|It's truly amazing that this work was created in 1974 with, I believe, all non-electric instruments. I'm a big fan of ambient/downtempo/minimalist electronica and I think that, for sheer beauty and &quot;out-there&quot;-ness, this album is pretty hard to beat. Amazingly expansive sounds that ebb and flow in an organic rhythmic symphony. Or something like that...definitely not like anything else I've come across, and an incredibly powerful album. Listen to it on a rainy Sunday with a cup of coffee or tea. A must-own in my opinion.
B00005R2M3|5.0|As the title of this review says, Shakira brings to music what has been long absent, that being some real music. This CD is marked by the words &quot;Written and Produced By Shakira&quot;, which is something not quite often seen in this industry, an artist doing their own work. So her success, personality, and style is one all of her own.<BR>     This CD is not as good as her Spanish, but it is great considering English is not even her 2nd language. The lyrics are deeper and more sensual than anything you are use to hearing, but not sensual in an overly-done &quot;Britney Spears&quot; kind of way. This CD contains just about all sounds. Rock, pop, soft rock, adult contemporary, latin-flavored, etc. If you are attracted to the Latin music scene and just like music to get down to, then this is your CD. Her voice is amazing. Like a cross between Alanis Morisette, Celine Dion, Sarah MacLachlan, Fiona Apple, Gwen Stefani, and Jewel. Sounds strange, but don't let that puch you away. Shakira holds a powerful voice that will vibrate your inner most parts and lyrics one can easily relate to. Now if that isn't real music, then I don't know what is!
B00005Q66T|1.0|I have to admit though, she is least offensive of the bunch of Hoochie singer/actresses that have been dredged up lately (Jennifer \\"I did'nt see anything, your honor\\" Lopez, Christina \\"I am not another version of Britanny\\" Agulera and \\"The Great Satan\\", Brittany S.). She can really almost actually sing and knows how to market her brand of disposable pop very well, but this CD is just a load of pedestrian trash. <br />Ms. M. has nothing left to offer anyone musically, not that there was much musical talent there to start with. Every song is totally uninspired and makes me think of how well the \\"un-Madonnaized\\" versions would sound.
0064431789|5.0|They're not called the \\"terrible two's\\" for nothing and the brilliance of this tale is in the fact Maurice Sendak has miraculously captured the rebellious and imaginative force of those in the thrall of the \\"terrible two's\\" in a way that anyone of any age can empathize with and appreciate.<br />Max. in typical terrible two fashion, has been a bit disrespectful to mom and is his room-sent there without his supper.  A magical world arises and Max is transported to where the Wild Things are--whimsical \\"monsters\\" who manage to look both scary and ridiculous at the same time.  Max, empowered in this world as he never is in his own, becomes ruler in this world and \\"manages\\" the rumpus that characterizes it--why, he even has the power to deny the monsters their own suppers!<br />In the end, however, Max decides to return to his room--to discover that though gone, he was not forgotten.<br />This is a truly marvelous book.  It's fun to read aloud, allowing the reader to be as expressive and dramatic as he wishes.  The illustrations are delightful--colorful, action filled and, best of all, always a true complement to the story at all times.<br />One of the best children's books ever written.  May the Rumpus never end!
B00005JKED|5.0|I Have'nt seen a police drama this good since Seven and this one is just about as good as it.

Buy it!
B00004Z459|4.0|Hybrid Theory is the perfect title for this album. <br />Though not deserving the revolutionary millennial breakthrough status that some would assign it, it is a very innovative album.  Essentially a &quot;hybrid&quot; of funky rap and mainstream rock in the Goo Goo Dolls vein, Hybrid Theory combines thoughtful and engaging lyrics--both rap oriented juxtaposed against traditional formulaic rock--and lively, melodic riffs aplenty.  <br />In the end, this stands as an album that one can both understand and appreciate. Moreover, though not exactly uplifting lyrically, it's not the utter depressive, melancholy, angst driven downer that so many recent \\"breakthrough bands\\", such as Stained, seems to be locked into. <br />This is great road music-it's got a permanent place in my car's CD changer.  What more can you ask of a rock album?

B00005QW5X|5.0|This is a highly enjoyable movie.  I was blown away by John Cameron Mitchell's performance as &quot;Hedwig&quot;. &quot;Hedwig&quot; is based on the off-Broadway play of the same name.  The DVD was loaded with information for those who didn't know the background of the story (like me).  I also enjoyed the original songs.  My favorite is, &quot;Wicked Little Town&quot;.  If you are a fan of musicals, I think you would definitely enjoy this.
B00005YTFG|5.0|What a cool movie! I really liked the style. I was afraid based on the music video sleeze of the Lady Marmalide quartete that it would be tacky, but praise God not! Ewan Mcgregor a singer who would of thought. But as a leading man definitely! He is sexy plus innocent in this role. I love this movie! It is our Wizard of Oz for our generation.
0553296981|5.0|hello! my name is nina and i am thirteen. i liked this book a lot because it helped me realize what a person in that situation would be thinkning, feeling and doing. this book touches my heart and it is the most personal, educational account coming from WWII as far as i would consider. this book is good for most ages over twelve because you can really relate to what she must've felt. over all i would say that it is educational yet fun and humorous and i would suggest that you read this magnificent literary masterpiece.
B00005RDCA|5.0|I must slightly disagree with other reviwers comments about the sound,firstly this is a signifagant improvment over what we had,but this wil never sound fabulous as compared to other wonderful remasters of 60's albums because cleary this was recorded in a fairy low-fi fashion ,if you listen carefully you wil note how distant the band is while the vocals are more up front,so while I would like it to be better I think this is as much as we can expect,so enjoy it for what it is not what it will never be

IT SEEMS AS IF THE SOUND ENGINEER AND THE PRODUCER CANT FIND A MIDDLE GROUND. THE CHEERS ON THIS CD ARE, IN MY OPINION, ARE WAY OVER THE TOP. I THINK SADE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SERVED RECORDING IN A SMALLER VENUE.IT SOUNDS AS IF SHE WAS THE SECOND COMING OF THE BEATLES LIVE.THE RECORDING ITSELF IS VERY GOOD HOWEVER IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CROWD NOISE WAS ADDED LATER. IVE BEEN TO OVER 300 CONCERTS AND HAVE NEVER HEARD THE CROWD FADE IN AND OUT ON CUE.

B00004TJWE|5.0|One of the great classics of the era,though unfortunatly not as well known as some other of their contemperaries,this is a definate must hear to any fan of early Pink Floyd or similar bands,as one reviewer stated above this is so completly different to their earlier R &amp; B matriel it's almost sounds like a completly different band (eaqually great though!)<BR> As for the sound this is the version to get,the stereo remaster is far better than either the mono remaster or the original Edsel issue,the sound jumps out at you and swirls around and is so much more revealing than earlier issues of this  that it ads a whole new psychedelic level to this gem
B00005ASOI|5.0|This is one i had to watch twice to experience all it has to offer. Surreal is a good description with a good body count for those of us who like our horror horrific.

B00005R2M3|4.0|I was very, very reluctant to sample Shakira's music, because I had pegged her as nothing more than a Latin/Arabic Britney Spears wannabe. At the time, I didn't know that Shakira was already a well-established Latin singer; I also didn't know that she wrote and produced the songs on \\"Laundry Service.\\" I finally decided to download a few of her songs at a friend's suggestion, and I ended up liking all of them and absolutely *loving* some of them.<br />Shakira's English album sounds like a conglomeration of Gwen Stefani, Jewel, and even a bit of Susanna Hoffs from the defunct '80s group the Bangles. The music is poppy and fun, although several of the songs are about one-sided relationships (especially my favorite, the interestingly named \\"Poem to a Horse\\"). My other favorites include \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" and \\"Fool.\\" I truly don't see the Alanis Morissette comparison in Shakira's sound and message, as her music isn't angry or angsty. \\"Laundry Service\\" is infectiously upbeat.<br />I also recommend checking out \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones?\\" \\"Eyes Like Yours\\" is much, much better and spicier in the original Spanish version, \\"Ojos Asi.\\"

B00005U1YO|4.0|It's not at all that this is a bad album... it hits harder than most anything I've picked up in the last year (with the glaring exception of Fatboy Slim's Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars).  The Chems are getting a bit cluttered in their sound these days.  The experiment that was Surrender never solidly dissolved into anything much, and Come With Us is only a small recovery from that.  The sounds are still jumbled, but with some nice work.  Star Guitar starts brilliantly, but loses feeling as the track adds sounds.  My Elastic Eye is a fun little song a la the more obscure tracks from Dig Your Own Hole.  Don't bother much with Beth Orton's track; William Orbit's complaint about Beth's voice sounding poor on Exit Planet Dust should be amplified a thousand-fold for her work here.  It just doesn't work (and I love Orton's work - Trailer Park and Superpinkymandy are essential).  There's quite a treat in The Test, though, with Richard Ashcroft sounding well over a great track.  It parallels Fatboy Slim's Song for Shelter in that it gives you that certain feeling; that the Chems got to where they want to be, and they're plenty happy, thank you.  It's quite the beautiful few moments.  Is it essential?  It's the Chemical Brothers, and their fans'll pick this up, probably happy (and relieved after Surrender).  But it's getting harder and harder for the uninitiated to connect with the music, and we're starting to run off the momentum from 1997 here.
630341964X|4.0|This is a wonderful movie set on the magnificant Biltmore Estate in North Carolina.  This is a must see
6304082428|3.0|This is the third film version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and A&E let all the stops out in their attempt to top the other two.  Unfortunately, this version falls short on most counts.<br /><br />The most glaring problem, besides the film's attempt to re-write some of Austen's dialogue (one does not re-write Austen, no matter what the temptation), is the fatal mistake of casting Colin Firth as Darcy.  Firth is a fine actor, but he tried to turn Darcy into a very 1990's character, and that just isn't Austen's Darcy.  A second problem was the character of Jane Bennet, who in this film spends most of her time whining and moralizing.  Austen never meant her to come across like that, and in this version she is just plain irritating.<br /><br />Most of the other actors were far inferior to the actors in the BBC version, with the notable exceptions of Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennet, and Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  Steadman was a riot, just as ditzy and wacky as Austen intended her to be, and Leigh-Hunt was a real gorgon as Lady Catherine.  As far as the character of Elizabeth Bennet is concerned, Jennifer Ehle had a tough act to follow but she was surprisingly good in this role.<br /><br />Overall, I got the impression that the producers of this version tried to out-Austen Austen, and overplayed their hand.  The BBC version was simpler, more concise, and much more effective.  I enjoyed watching the A&E version once, but I wouldn't watch it twice.  It just isn't Austen.<br /><br />Judy Lind
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes portrays the events of a young boy, Frank McCourt, from his early childhood through age nineteen.  It tells of the family's hardships and heartbreak, and although the novel could be incredibly depressing, the author's insight makes the book universal, and makes the particular relavent to all.  I enjoyed the details about Irish life during the depression, and the ways that people survived, and tried to keep their dignity even on the precipice of despair and death.  The prose is imaginative and the dialogue quite memorable.  I read this book in a day because it was so intriguing, and I bet that you'll enjoy it, too.
B00000HZFP|5.0|I have just finished listening to this CD for the first time. It is incredible! I'm especially pleased in that I chose this version over the movie soundtrack. I can't imagine the soundtrack being better. Even though I discovered this music via the movie I'm generally of the mindset that movie soundtracks have a tendency to be over-produced. Having listened to samples from both albums before purchasing I could clearly see that Hedwig was no exception. Therefore, for those of you having to make the same choice, get this one. There is no way they could have made it better than this. And from the samples I heard, they didn't. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
B00005K3OT|5.0|A wonderful movie!  The acting, filming, scenery, and music are first class all the way.<BR>I must disgree with prior reviewers who see it as a duel between temptation and morality. It would be closer to say it's a duel between living life and repressing the urge to do so.  Neither chocolate nor sex are in any way inherently immoral, and while marriage CAN (and should) be sacred, the contrast between the never-married Vianne and the united-in-the-eyes-of-God Josephine and her husband says more about what's really sacred than any religious doctrine ever could.<BR>It was clear to me that Vianne and Roux are two of the MOST MORAL people in the film!  They are loving and nurturing souls, full of life and willing to share (esp. Vianne) what they have with anyone and everyone.  Towards the end, when Vianne finds the mayor in a rather compromised position that is in fact invasive and (at least materially) costful to herself, her response is a generous smile and an assurance that she won't tell a soul.  This to a man who has from the start intended to drive her out of town, and has demeaned her reputation, even going so far as to forbid interaction with her and have her represented as an agent of Satan in the church sermons!  <BR>Who is moral here, and who is not? The mayor is 'god-fearing' and well intentioned (in his own mind at any rate), and obviously a kind man, but he can only extend his goodness to a very limited subset of similar people.  Vianne on the other hand offers her gifts generously to everyone (well, maybe not Josephine's husband!) even if they intend her no good. Aside from the unfortunate way she drags her unwilling daughter from place to place I can't think of a single example of non-generous behavior.<br />The acting is marvelous!  The transformation on Judi Dench's face as she sips that first cup of chocolate is absolutely magical.  The emotional growth of the boy, of Lena Olin's character, even of the mayor... all wonderful.  The supporting cast was uniformly excellent, Leslie Caron, John Wood, Hugh O'Conor and many more too numerous to mention.  Alfred Molina carries a difficult role very well, and Johnny Depp too was excellent.  I was very impressed by both his taste in music and his ability to perform it himself.  Django Reinhardt and Robert Johnson, two of my all time favorites!<br />And if you'r a chocaholic like me watch out!! You can almost taste it.  Bravo!!!!!
0345448898|5.0|When I first started reading the first book I was reading until 12:00PM! Then my mom told me to go to bed. I kept thinking about the book all night. It was such a good book that I began to beleive that I was Lyra, the main character. I cried at some parts of the book and at some parts I burst out laughing for no reason at all. I highly reccomend this book and I hope my information will help you. Philip Pullman is a fantastic author and I would so much love to meet him. Before I read his books my favourites were Harry Potter and any Jacqueline Wilson books. I just hoped the story could go on forever...

0553213105|4.0|Originally entitled First Impression, Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice is a sophisticated love story, elegantly portrayed during the 18th century.  Satirizing the Victorian woman's quest for an ideal husband, Austen's witty humor provides much amusement for the reader. The complex plot and the dramatic lives of the Bennet family enable the reader to become engrossed within Austen's masterpiece.<br />The points of view of the novel are shown through Austen's usage of the limited omniscient as well as first person accounts, which are shown through personal letters of the characters.  Her unique literary style enables the reader to better understand the mood and dramatic emotions of the characters.  The letters intertwined throughout the book, advance the plot and greatly invoke the interest of the reader.<br />Although all the characters contribute to the entertaining quality of the novel, the most auspicious were indeed Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy.  With Elizabeth's out-spoken manners and Darcy's arrogant yet shy persona, both characters were quick to judge the other based upon their first impressions.  As the novel progressed, Elizabeth's humor and charm, not only won over the reader but Darcy as well.  We also enjoyed Darcy's evolution from a shy and rather self righteous aristocrat, into a kind, endearing, as well as understanding man.  His interactions with Lizzy provided conflict and laughter.  Mrs. Bennet's \\"nerves\\" also served as our source of amusement.<br />This intellectual novel entails deception, love, comedy, and above all, a glimpse into 18th century society. We enjoyed the conclusion, in which Austen meets our satisfaction by tying all the loose ends together.  Despite it's title, the characters of the novel overcome prejudice, but never lost their pride.
B00003CXCT|3.0|As a kid of 6 when this movie first hit the movie palace, I was taken aback - and still am when I think of the memories that were spawned from this film and the two original sequels. Over the years, I returned to see this film time and time again -- marveling at it's ability to still captivate after so many viewings and so many years; not to mention its impact of pop culture, filmmaking and merchandising.<br />Star Wars became more than a movie phenomenon, it became part of the public trust. However, when George Lucas decided to return to his so-called well of imagination for the notoriously divisive and no doubt reprehensible Phantom Menance, he forever marred the earlier works - completely. One truly can no longer appreciate the original three films, because of the near butchery of the magic done by Episode I. I'll even wager that the Episode II: Attack of the Clones does more to denigrate the Star Wars trilogy.<br />And let's not forget the incessant tampering that Lucas has continued to do with the original trilogy when he re-released them back in 1997. I'm so glad that I have the THX laserdisc boxed-set, so I can see these films as they were first introduced to the public, not some retooled pieces of digital wizardry that they have become. Can anyone truly justify (with a straight face) the re-edit that has Greedo shoot at Han first? Or how thoroughly ananchronistic the CGI Jabba appears? There is even rumor that Episodes IV-VI will be rejiggered again when they finally appear on DVD.<br />If one doesn't leave a work alone can the subjective rating of that work remain constant? One could argue the continual tampering lessens the overall quality of the original.<br />Star Wars circa 1996 was a classic film, now... I don't know what it is, perhaps the continual workings of an obivously misdubbed, misguided and spent creative spirit.
B00005U18E|3.0|This was a cute film about a hapless, 30-something singleton trying to make her way in the world. I can relate to the main character on many levels, with the exception of the weight thing. I workout 4-5 days a week and wear a size 8. Nonetheless, the title character didn't look all that big to me. I think it's a sad commentary on society when a perfectly average-looking size 12 woman is considered chubby. That aside, the film is dead-on accurate in its portrayal of some of the self-destructive things that we females can sometimes do to ourselves -- the chain smoking, the excessive drinking, the binging and let me not forget the bad habit of hooking up with unsuitable men. In many ways this movie holds a mirror up to how some of us really live, which is markedly different from what we would have others believe. Not all single women are living like the gals on \\"Sex And the City.\\" Some of us are quite ordinary and clueless -- but not me of course. 8-)<br />Zellweger is convincing as the earnest, if clumsy, Bridget. This is a physical comedy complete with many pratfalls and sight gags -- I was in stitches at the sight of those big ole granny panties that she chose instead of that little black thong. And who could forget her television debut that showed her entire butt the world after she slid down a pole?<br />I have to admit that ending surprised me because I thought that Mark was gone for good after he (rather nosily!) read some of our heroine's cutting remarks about him in her diary. But Bridget ran after him into the cold night, wearing next to nothing, and gets the surprise of her life. Ah, I am a sucker for a story with a happy ending. Some viewers complained that the movie implied that Bridget felt incomplete without a man, however, that is not my take on it. She wanted him, and he reciprocated her feelings. What's so bad about that? Further, I think that most of us desire companionship and spend quite a bit of time pursuing it and/or lamenting the lack thereof. It's not like Bridget closed herself off from the world and put her life on hold until Prince Charming arrived. True she did look in the wrong places and did wallow a bit in self-pity, but I think she was getting it together toward the end. At the very least, she was not afraid to make herself vulnerable even when she had plenty of reason to be gun-shy. And if that isn't courageous, then I don't know what is. I enjoyed this movie about an average Jane determined to proceed through life despite the occasional pitfall. That's all that any of us can do.It's not like Bridget closed herself off from the world and put her life on hold until Prince Charming arrived.

B00005QXXO|4.0|&quot;I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings&quot; apparently does a great job of capturing the feel of Radiohead during their 2001 tour in support of Kid A and Amnesiac, which is great for people like me who didn't get to catch the tour.  Everyone's favorites from the Kid A/Amnesiac duo make an appearance on the live recordings:  &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; is STUNNING; instead of keyboards or synthesizers, we're treated to a piano accompaniment to Thom's vocals, which makes lines like &quot;I'm being cut to shreds&quot; sound even more haunting.  &quot;Idiotheque&quot; is full of energy, you can just FEEL the buzz from the audience on this song, and &quot;True Love Waits&quot;, a previously-unreleased track, has about as much, if not more, melancholy than Creep or How I Made My Millions.  These tracks alone make the CD worth getting.<br />Despite the fact that there are some AMAZING (repeat, AMAZING) songs on &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, I feel a slight bit cheated: I expect more from Radiohead than a 40 minute, 16 second CD.  Come on, I've seen opening bands play this long, if not longer... there's a full thirty-four minutes left on the CD that could have been used for extra tracks, and I KNOW they played on stage for longer than 40 minutes.<br />It's nice to see an album devoted to live songs, instead of getting the occasional live track on one of their numerous b-sides, but when I'm buying a full album, that's what I'd like:  a FULL album.  Despite the small track listing, the song quality more than makes up for this fact, making it an album no Radiohead fan should be without.
B00005JKYS|5.0|I had the distinguished honor of going to the Atlanta premiere of this movie with a man who flew this same type of helicopters later in the war. The movie was excellent. It brought alive a very balanced mixture of emotions. It was painful, it was humorous. Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott brought to life the real life heros that have for so long had their story untold. I will say, though, it was very graphic in parts. It was, after all, a war movie. But the humor and the emotions you felt for the soldiers and their families evened it all out. I highly recommend this movie.

B00000ING2|5.0|The Coen brothers' warmest, smartest comedy--and I'm a huge fan of all their work (don't get me started on Miller's Crossing). Obviously, anyone who's seen and liked a Coen brothers film will like this, but if you're a Frank Capra fan you'll also like it.<br />After despondent C.E.O. Werring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) throws himself off the 44th floor, the conniving V.P., Sidney J. Mussberger (Paul Newman at his shrewd best) and the rest of the Board have to move fast to steal the stock before it goes public. So they decide to crash the stock by promoting new mailmroom clerk and schmuck Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins, in yet another great performance) to President. Unfortunately for the Board, Barnes has a few tricks up his sleeve. Unfortunately for Barnes, Jennifer Jason Leigh's fast-talking reporter is hot on his trail<br />Dazzling cinematography from Roger Deakins, wonderful production design emulating the 50s and the 30s, and a rich, textured score by Carter Burwell and well-done special effects (in a Coen bros. movie??) all contribute to make this a wonderful, thoroughly entertaining film.<br />Think of Preston Sturges directing a Horatio Alger story crossed with Terry Gilliam and you'll have an inkling of how good this film is. Should have won Oscars in 1994 (along with Red & Quiz Show, and Pulp Fiction) instead of Gump, but them's the breaks. This film really needs to be in widescreen, so watch the DVD and not the pan-and-scan VHS.

074322454X|4.0|This is unquestionably the best book by Stephen Ambrose that I have read, in the main because it's pretty honest about what it is and what it isn't. Band of Brothers clearly isn't trying to be a \\"serious\\" history of WWII or the 101st Airborne. Ambrose set out to chronicle the experiences of the members of E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from training through their return home, and in this he does a fabulous job. The work done in interviewing and rationalising the stories of all these different men, and turning it into a tight, engrossing, readable book is very impressive. Reading Band of Brothers really does feel like sitting down with the members of E Company and having them recount their story in a crisp, clear, and rivetting way.<br />I do have some minor qualms about the book though, and thus only four stars. It has to my mind a bit of a war-as-action-adventure feel. While the grime of war is mentioned, and even examined at times, Ambrose tends to be upbeat and tends to keep the unpleasentness at arms length. After all, we know all the main characters will survive because if they hadn't, there would be no story or they wouldn't be main characters. His narrative simply lacks the bite of, say, Guy Sajer's The Forgotten Soldier. Ambrose tends to look upon the members of E Company virtually as gods - perhaps a not unfounded opinion, but one that certainly interferes with his judgement on several occasions. Maybe it's just me, but I think a more critical look at events would actually make the members of E Company look even better, as Band of Brothers doesn't do as good a job as Keegan, Bergerud, or Sajer at conveying how hard and dangerous things really were.<br />It is important to remember that Band of Brothers does lack the critical angle of serious history. This is not a random infantry company, but one selected very specifically in retrospect. Other than interviews, Ambrose really only draws on two sources (!), one of which is the regimental history (while there are a fair number of footnotes in the book, they seem mostly for show as they get rather monotonous). In his landmark Face of Battle, written some 15 years before Band of Brothers, John Keegan agonises over the role of the military historian, and how a man who has never heard a shot fired in anger can convey any sense of \\"what it's like\\" to be in battle in his brilliant introduction to that book. Suffice to say, Ambrose is not troubled by such difficult questions and falls feet-first into some of the traps Keegan describes.<br />Bearing all this firmly in mind, however, and not trying to take this book for somthing which it isn't, Band of Brothers is still excellent and very highly recommended (moreso than the HBO miniseries, which didn't really capture the strengths of the book I thought). As somthing somewhere between reminiscence and history, this will give you a basic appreciation of what it was like for an elite, highly-motivated squad during World War II. I'd just recommend supplementing it perhaps with John Keegan's Six Armies in Normandy or The Face of Battle, both of which provide brilliant and critical insight into the nature of battle.
6300267997|2.0|Although, as reviewer Sean R. Scheiderer has pointed out, \\"Evergreen\\" is a beautiful song, beautifully sung (and a beautiful scene), the rest of this 70's era ego-fest has to be seen to be believed.  A remake of a remake of a remake, it's not only dated by its hideous 70's outfits (Bab's are credited to \\"her closet\\"), sets (their desert retreat looks like the first adobe garden shed), and hair, but by the ridiculous conceit that Barbra's \\"totally Vegas\\" style of performing would be considered rock.  The scene where she performs \\"Woman in the Moon\\" to an at first annoyed, then lifted-off-their-feet crowd is such hilarious- I am here to tell you, they would have thrown things.  Imagine a stadium full of people expecting Limp Bizkit and getting the Captain and Tenille.  Or the scene where she ask fo a blanket to cover the blanket covered body of Kristofferson- it's like she wanted to make sure that he wouldn't detract from her performance by being seen.  <br />This isn't even cheese- it's cheez whiz.
B00005QG9J|1.0|Hasn't anyone noticed how these guys sound just like Hoobastank? I think they should develop their own sound and not clone themsevles as a Hoobastank wanna-be band. The lead singer even sounds like Douglas Robb in every aspect. These guys are totally unoriginal!
B00005Y228|5.0|This is simply the best album Kylie has ever made, and one of the best pop/dance albums ever! Almost all of the tracks are very good. My favorite tracks are &quot;Love Affair&quot;, &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;. Even though &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; is the most popular song from the album, I think there are many better songs on the album than that one. If you love pop/dance, this is an album you MUST have!
0380788624|5.0|After a lifetime reading and loving books, this is one of the few that leaves me short of superlatives. It has it all...and it's so darned FUNNY.
B00000K3D4|4.0|I must stress that my score of 4 stars is based on the netire DVD package, not just the movie itself.<br /> Labyrinth is a great film, and the movie that my family watches anually at Holloween since I got the DVD. The acting in the movie is a little cheesy in parts, mostly Jennifer Connely, however David Bowie was compelling in his role the Goblin king... the tights are a bit unsightly though. This movie is an essential must own for Jim Henson fans. It is also the first Lucas film to hit DVD. As the first I suppose one must go easy on the over all DVD, but I've come to expect more out of Mr. Lucas when it comes to &quot;special editions.&quot; The transfer is not much better than the VHS version, although the colors are more vibrant and richer, and the widescreen presentation is also a nice touch, it was still a little grainey, and there were parts where it was overly obvious a blue screen and optical print was used, all things which could have easily been corrected at very little cost. The special features are nice, and informative, but not substantial. It would have been nice if this package had been as fully loaded as the Dark Crystal. Still it does have above average special features. And it's definately worth buying, it just could have been better.

B00004W19V|4.0|Beautiful widescreen, better see! As a child I loved Short Circuit, and it's not so successful sequel. The expolits of the robot # 5 who thought that he was a living breathing thinking individual with feelings was a rather entertaining movie with a lot of the stuff that kids find cool in it. A crazy funny robot with some classic tag lines, lazers, and explosions, and a movie that's in general silly.<br />  Until this DVD was released I never got to see this movie in widescreen, and now that I have I am shocked as to how much of the picture was actually missing. The more widescreen movies that I watch the less I can stand Pan & Scam. Short Circuit was a movie that really suffered when it was transfered to pan & Scam. The movie has a decent transfer, not the best, but this is certainly the best presentation of the movie I have ever seen, and it also features decent sound. It's a little lacking in the special features, but would be a good buy for those wanting to relive a childhood memory from the 80s. Unlike Bill & Ted, this movie actually holds up against the test of time, not as well as other 80s classics, but from a decade of [bad] movies, this one's still pretty funny.
0800129806|5.0|When you think of Sean Connery, what role could be better for him<BR>to play than that of King Arthur.  A wonderful movie with some terrific acting.  This movie brings to life the legendary tale of<BR>King Arthur and the knights of the round table.  Just as King Arthur is about to send Sir Lancelot (Richard Gere) to his death,<BR>the evil knight Malagent invades Camelot and gives Arthur an ultimatum: serve me or die.  To find out what happens, you will<BR>have to see for yourself.  A spectacual film.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I grew up on Santana--many of my peers had no idea who he was until this CD came out.  &quot;Migra,&quot; &quot;Africa Bamba&quot; (my favorite), &quot;El Farol&quot; and others are classic Santana--mixing Latin rythms with a guitar that can not be classified as to genere.<br />The artists who joined him and his band also have done a fine job, but they should be given even more credit in another area that seems to be forgotten: they introduced Santana to a whole different audience.  Bravo!  Also, it was wonderful to hear Santana lay down some licks on what is essentially a rap song--&quot;Do You Like the Way&quot; with Lauryn Hill and CEE Lo.  &quot;Put Your Lights On&quot; (featuring Everlast) should make any alternative music fan smile.
B000002G89|5.0|6 stars.<br />I have three different versions of this CD.  The original came out in the early '80s and it has the same lineup of songs as the vinyl.  It was poorly mastered and did not sound as good as a clean copy on vinyl.  This remastered recording is a big improvement on the sound quality.  Realize that this was not an audiophile undertaking in the studio, so you will hear tape hiss that is louder than many rock recording of the era.  For example, compare this to Frank Zappa's recordings from the 70's or maybe something by Elton John.  But if you're really into theis CD, you need to find a copy of the Mobile Fidelity Gold CD.  It's even cleaner than this version.<br />Moving beyond the sound, the music is really where it's at.  Those of us that loved Clapton back at the time felt he was a little like Casey, at bat in the 9th inning with two outs and a full count.  We were genuinely worried about his survival.  He'd had problems with drug and alcohol abuse and it was easy to believe he'd go the way of Hendrix, Joplin and Morrison.  Instead, his friends helped him to get back into the music and this classic was the result.  We're all the wealthier for it.<br />Much of this CD has been played to death by FM radio but it still doesn't spoil it for me.  How many times have you heard I Shot The Sherrif?  Me too.  But I can still enjoy hearing the whole album.  The slide riffs on Motherless Children still make me want to get up and boogie and Willy And The Hand Jive still elicits a shuffle outbreak.  Get Ready sounds even heavier today than it did when this was new.  And it doesn't get any better than I Can't Hold Out, from the opening riff that clears the head to the anxious lyrics that set the mood.  With this playing at home on the big stereo, I just Let It Grow and when it's in the car player, I'm A Steady Rollin Man !
B00005QG9J|5.0|I got this cd for christmas and it is one of my favorite cds I own. Brandon Boyd's voice is incredible. I can listen through this whole cd without having to skip a song. The music and lyrics on this cd are excellent. Any age can listen to it and still relate. Here's a rating of all the songs:<br />1.Nice To Know You-- 7/10<BR>2.Circles--10/10<BR>3.Wish You Were Here--9/10<BR>4.Just A Phase--10/10<BR>5.11 am--8/10<BR>6.Blood On The Ground--10/10<BR>7.Mexico--5/10<BR>8.Warning--9/10<BR>9.Echo--10/10<BR>10.Have You Ever--8/10<BR>11.Are You In?--10/10<BR>12.Under My Umbrella--11/10<BR>13.Aquerous Transmission--7/10<br />GO BUY THIS CD!!!
B00004THAY|5.0|If this CD only had one song on it, I'd still buy it.  BB and Eric were in the groove and their interplay yielded a classic.  This album isn't just about guitar playing and it's not just about the blues.  It's about a love for the music and a love for each other.  These attitudes ooze forth from the music like syrup onto pancakes on a cold December morning.<br />Realize I'm not saying a thing bad about the guitar playing.  It is stellar and fans of these two can easily tell who is playing which lick.  The recording quality is excellent.  But what really sets the CD apart for me is the vocal interplay, which is incredible.  Check out the call and response on Key To The Highway.  Feel the funk of the vocals on Hold On, I'm Comin'.  This is incredible stuff.  Other favorites include Worried Life Blues, 3 O'clock Blues and When My Heart Beats Like A Hammer.<br />Eric and BB could have sold a ton of product, regardless of quality but instead, they created art with a wide range of emotion.  They had talked of recording together for years and I'm so glad they finally got around to it.
B00001IVOR|3.0|The important thing to understand is that the second disc is great, and the first disc is HORRIBLE. The only good songs on the first CD are &quot;A better tomorrow&quot; and &quot;It's Yourz&quot;. So basically, you have to ask yourself if you want to buy a 2-CD Album and only play half of it. <BR><BR>Also, I should add, that Wu-Tang stresses their lyrical abilities more than the musical aspect of the beats themselves. You'll find more catchy, musical rap somewhere else. Again though, the second CD is pretty good about all that. But if you're into some ill rhymes, check this album out. If you want Wu-Tang's best album, look no further than the 36 Chambers.
B00005AR3G|4.0|The message is a good one. Basically be kind, or Karma will catch up with you, the golden rule, etc. To any mature mind, this is easy to spot. However, for the younger audiences, preschool and under, this may need some explaining. Emperor Kuzco is only nice for the last few minutes of the film and never really says that he learned from his mistakes or that his poor treatment of others was wrong (unless he is tricking them). Parents of little ones may need to add their own narration while watching the movie to help insure that preschoolers don't just assume Kuzco's rude behavior is cool (like mine did). Overall, this is an extreamly enjoyable film. I highly recomend it. It is funny enough to watch over and over with your child. Just be sure they understand the theme.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Play is a brilliant CD, opening with the song honey it has a very old south kind of feel. He really blends so many different styles together in this album that at its first listen you can't quite be sure what direction he is taking you.<br />Some songs such as Porcelain, Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad, and The Sky is Broken have a somber and melodic, yet haunting feel to them. Then before you can get too worn down he heads into upbeat danceable tracks like Body Rock and Machete. There are so many styles and textures layered into this album it creates the pattern of the sheer musical genius that is Moby.<br />Simply put this CD is brilliant, and when you listen to it, you will realise why it's gone mulitple platinum since it's release. Moby has taken himself to the next level in Play, don't miss out on this one.
B00004W55E|3.0|She's still got the voice, but this is a hit and miss <BR>affair.
B00003CXXS|3.0|In June, 1993, Universal Pictures released \\"Jurassic Park\\". It produced $357 Million in sales, the 5th highest grossing movie of all time. Later they made a sequel. 2001 gave us \\"Jurassic Park III\\", a return to the land of \\"winkin, blinkin, and nod\\", with bigger and badder dinosaurs than ever before. Paleontologist Alan Grant is lured to Isla Sorna, a remote Costa Rican island, to help search for a boy lost in the jungle. He accompanies the boy's father and ex-wife. Their plane crash-lands, and this energetic thrill-ride is ready to begin.  The brilliant, breathtaking opening sequence sets the tone, as two parasailing tourists' vacation is jolted by unseen monsters from an ancient past.  But what's wrong with \\"JP III\\"?   Not the effects. Just the story. Sam Neill returns as Alan Grant, the confident leader. Tea Leoni and Bill Macy play the divorced couple trying to re-ignite their fallen marriage. But there's no chemistry here. Leoni's character is a shrill bimbo housewife. You just don't care about these people. Laura Dern is wasted in a small role. The real star of \\"JP III\\" is the spinosaurus: the largest(60 feet) meat-eating dinosaur that ever lived(bigger than T-Rex). The super-star is the excellent effects(animatronics, rotoscope, and CGI). \\"JP III\\" was lushly filmed on three islands in Hawaii, off Palos Verdes, Cal., around Los Angeles, Universal sound stages and back lot, and even Fallow Lake(used in 1954 for \\"Creature from the Black Lagoon\\"). This new DVD is anamorphic widescreen 1.85:, and features a haughty commentary by Stan Winston and the effects crew. You also get photos, clips, interviews, a short on an actual dinosaur dig in Montana, and scenes of participants riding Jurassic Park theme ride at Universal City. As undeveloped movie characters lose your interest, the dinosaurs and cinema magic take over. An early scene tells it all: Alan Grant and his aide disembark from their damaged plane on the island. Suddenly a frightening roar bellows from the jungle.  Grant's sidekick says: \\"Oh no. It's Tyrannosaurus Rex!\\" But Grant says: \\"No it's not..It's something bigger...\\"
6305513406|4.0|Another great pairing of classic episodes from the original Star Trek.  The first \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" charts the disastrous first attempt of the USS Enterprise to cross a powerful energy barrier at the edge of the galaxy.  Nearing the galactic rim, the Enterprise encounters the flight recorder of another ship doomed in its own bid to leave the galaxy.  Cryptic shreds of the recorder indicate that, though crippled by the barrier, something else caused the ship's destruction.  Encountering the barrier itself, the Enterprise is nearly rendered dead in space.  Worse, two crewmen - Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) and Liz Dehner (Sally Kellerman) - are struck down by the energy.  Mitchell is only temporarily phased, but burgeoning psychic powers and a newly cold demeanor clue the remaining crew that something is very wrong.  (Mitchell's eyes, turned into silvery orbs, is also a tip-off, but the crew's too busy repairing their ship to notice.  Hitting on a plan to maroon Mitchell (who seems to have been driven insane by his newfound power) on a remote Starfleet outpost, Kirk finds he must confront the monster who was once his trusted crewmate and best friend.  <br />\\"No Man\\" was a great episode for so many reasons.  Still bearing the show's original vision, it seems cold, but that only highlights the rigors of deep space exploration, somewhat lost when the show adapted he more light-colored pastels of the late 1960's.  (nothing more exemplified this than the smaller, louder, monotone and more functional bridge).  Though the stars haven't fully established their campier alter-egos, the script deftly highlights their relationships - especially the Kirk-Mitchell relationship.  (At one point, the two were equals, but Kirk exceled when it mattered and now he gives the orders).<br />The \\"Corbomite Maneuver\\" is also a classic.  Though the ominous Blalok made a single appearance on the show, his initial image was unforgettable (having it in the closing credits couldn't hurt).  In this episode, the Enterprise is forced to destroy a cube-like probe emitting harmful radiation, and then forced to confront the probe's creators - the hitherto unknown \\"First Federation\\".  With his ship dwarfed by the First Federation's ship, the \\"Fesarius\\", Kirk knows he can't rely on technology, and instead turns to the human talent for bamboozling, warning the alien ship of a federation device powerful enough to reflect back any energy directed at it.  (We'll be destroyed, but we won't go alone, Kirk seems to say).  With a simple plot, the script milks gallons of tension.  The premise, relying on pluck excels over latter generations of Trek relying simply on techno-babble.  There's also the character of Bailey - usually side characters are nothing more than fodder (somebody has to die, as long as it's somebody else) - but the script allows him to rise above that.
0066620996|5.0|It will debunk many of the commonly accepted principles of what makes a mediocre company great.
6305363668|4.0|Harrison Ford is Deckard, a police detective specially assigned hunt down rogue androids called replicants. Consequential innovations of a distant future (actually 2019, and we're past the halfway point between that date and this flick's initial release), replicants are so apparently human, only the detectives called Blade Runners can spot and retire them. Deckard actually hs a lot in common with his victims - after years of chasing androids down, Deckard has become something colder than human (his wife, Deckard told us in the original studio cut, compared him to sushi - a cold fish) and is a retiree himself when first asked to take one more case. Long disillusioned, Deckard allows his ex-boss, a bloated bigot named Bryant (Emmet Walsh) to bad-cop him into hunting down a batch of especially dangerous military replicants called Nexus-6 and led by android Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer). Though few replicants even attempt to return to Earth where they are anyway outlawed the band led by Batty return not only to Earth, but attempt to break into the factory that developed them. (A fellow Blade Runner is critically wounded when crossing paths with one of the band disguised as a factory worker.) Though long disenchanted with a job that had him killing the human-like machines, Deckard outwardly maintains that replicants really are machines either a benefit or a hazard. Only Deckard's love for the sad Rachel (Sean Young), an android who is slowly realizing that she is not human, forces him to change his perspective. (Most of the film has Deckard falling for Rachel, keeping him one step behind the androids themselves). Batty closes in on a meeting with his maker - the founding engineer of Tyrell corporation, a sort of aloof and godlike character who lives in a room looking like one in the Vatican apartments and set inside of a building looking like a huge Aztec pyramid. Meanwhile, Deckard works to catch-up with Batty while staying one-step ahead of another Blade Runner, Gaff (Edward James Olmos) who is gunning for Rachel. The Androids are programmed to die after 4 years a measure designed, less to protect humans from the replicants violent streak than merely prevent the machines from attaining human-like emotional states. One-by-one, Deckard tracks down each of the replicants and, after withstanding a bruising to his body and soul, kills them. With the death of Batty, Deckard's conversion is complete he can never hunt again, nor can he remain in the dark and doomed city that was his hunting ground.<br />WHY THIS MOVIE IS OVERBLOWN. Blade Runner was an early attempt at sci-fi high concept the crossing over of two genres, in this case, sci-fi with 1940's film noir, but it opened in 1982 alongside the film-noir spoof \\"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\\" both films featuring voice-overs by stars with similar sounding voices (Steve Martin and Harrison Ford). The city-scape of the Los Angeles of the future looks fully-realized, complete with flying cars, industrial smoke stacks, giant bill-boards and gouges of flame, but much of the drama is personal the elaborate special effects seldom becoming little more than eye-candy (though sumptuous). Down-to-Earth exteriors, while frenetic and crowded, never look more than incredibly detailed soundstages. (The billboards hawking Pan-Am and Atari as well as a general atmosphere that presumes a modern culture stemming from the economic dominance of Pacific-rim industrial power are amusingly dated). The smoky interior effects and junk-technology in movies like this and Alien, though elaborate, gave rise to the now prevailing futurism which simply relies on cheesy camera-work and second-hand set design. (In classic sci-fi, the future is the clean, orderly and largely tax-free result of human pluck that survived some vaguely catastrophic event occurring shortly after whatever book or film its set in.)  The Director's cut is better in some spots than the '82 wide release version, but falls in others.  The voice overs of the 82' cut were weak (though the \\"sushi\\" line was priceless), but eliminating them here only exposes the weak narrative of original.  The new version also jettisons the optimism-tinged ending (complete with aerial shots ripped from \\"The Shining\\"), but adds in dream sequences filled with unicorns, suggesting the fairy tale \\"Legend\\".  (The interior sets, atmosphere and Vangelis score also suggest that film, making it hard to remember that that movie actually followed \\"Runner\\" rathern than preceding it).<br />WHY YOU MUST STILL SEE IT: Besides its larger warning of a future as being a bleak era scarred by evils prevalent today (corporate governance, ecological disintegration and dehumanizing technology) \\"Runner\\" is also a film with unforgettable characters. While Deckard is remote, your heart will be broken by Rachel and the even the murderous Batty. Despite the death he inflicts or hints at in almost every scene he's in, the script wisely keeps Batty soft-spoken to the point of being a child (Gosh, you've... really got some nice toys here), rewarding him with a christ-like death scene sure to tug at your heartstrings. I still don't know what C-Beams are, but it's a moment in Batty's life which will die with him, and that's the painful thing.  The flick tanked largely (cultists claimed) because of a studio-ordered cut adding an upbeat ending and the off-camera narration by Harrison Ford. Those studio-execs never get respect. Catching the Director's Cut in 92, I realized that those studio execs took the fall for a film with an irreparably poor narrative, one so limited, that fans can debate such nonsensical ideas like whether Deckard himself is an android. If that were true, the moral of the film (warning of machines becoming more human than those who build and use them) would be pointless. Instead, Deckards story is of a man once forced to become something like a machine, and now given a last chance to find his way back. You should also catch Runner because of its dated vision, catching those aspects of the film that weren't ahead of their time, but are rooted to a more innocent age flying cars, Pan-Am and early 80's synthesized score courtesy of Vangelis.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Anyone who does not love Moulin Rouge is crazy. Nicole Kidman is phenominal as the beautiful Satine and Ewan McGregor is perfect as her Romeo[nod to Baz].

0812550706|5.0|I read this book about a year ago in the 4th grade and ENDERS GAME is still fresh in my mind. ENDERS GAME was among the assortment of my brothers books, and I thought it looked interesting. But it was so much more than that. ENDERS GAME and its sequels are among the best books I've read in my young life(which is a lot). This is definatly a good book for gifted readers. Like the kids who sometimes get made fun of simply because they're intelligent(much like the kids in this book). ENDERS GAME is so exciting it makes you want to read it for hours on end, and sometimes the stupid plans or ideas that people come up with make you want to laugh because they are destined to fail. Orsen Scott Card has done and outstanding job writing ENDERS GAME and its sequels. When you read the story its like your in the Battle School playing (or commanding) in a non-gravity battle! Although this book was ment for adults you will insteadly fall in love with the story of Ender and his gangs. I've already read ENDERS SHADOW and SHADOW OF THE HEGAMON, and they are just as good as ENDERS GAME. This book is the start of a series you will never forget. You will love reading about Ender in Battle School as much as you will love reading about Peter and Valentine's plot to eventually take over the world.
B000009QPG|5.0|SEASONS IN THE ABYSS is just a plain awesome metal masterpiece from SLAYER. The album is filled with killer riffs, awesome drumming and great freakin songs. This is one of the best metal albums ever released and it just might be the best album ever released during the 90's. The album just kicks a** from start to finish. WAR ENSEMBLE, BLOOD RED, SPIRIT IN BLACK, EXPENDABLE YOUTH, DEAD SKIN MASK, and SEASONS IN THE ABYSS are songs that you have to listen to. They are fast, heavy and just plain in your face riffs that will get you banging and thrashing all around in no time at all. If you take SEASONS IN THE ABYSS, along with the two albums before it, SOUTH OF HEAVEN and REGIN IN BLOOD, you have 3 classic albums released in a row that will rival even the ROLLING STONES heyday with the BEGGARS BANQUET to EXILE ON MAIN ST. classic period. Even with the songs I mentioned above, the 4 remaining songs are also classic and the listener will love them also. This album will remind the listener of how great metal was at the time and will have us also longing for another glory period of metal once again.
6305001162|5.0|Grease is the word. This is a great flick to watch late at night with all the lights off and your chick snuggled up against you. You know you're gonna get some as soon as the credits start to roll.<br />John Travolta was never cooler, and Olivia never looked better. You've seen this movie a million times just like I have. I ain't gonna break down the plot, or highlight the best scenes. You love it, admit it. Though I will say 'Cherry' was my favorite Pink Lady, what a pair of ta-tas.<br />One friendly word of advice......AVOID THE SEQUEL AT ALL COSTS!!!!!
B000009QPE|4.0|REIGN IN BLOOD is just pure thrash in your face metal that will leave u speechless and gasping for breath. All of the songs are short burst of killer riffs with heavy drums. The speed on these songs is like watching the INDY 500 and trying to keep up. this is metal music the way it should be, a take no prisoners approach. SLAYER has always played thier music in this fashion and they are in fine form here. ANGEL OF DEATH, POSTMORTEM, RAINING BLOOD and REBORN are classic trakcs that any metalhead will enjoy. So I highly recommend buying this album setting your stereo to 10 and just bang and thrash till your heart is content. This album is for true metal fans only, most fans of the nu-metal movement will probably find this album to intense and be turned off by it, but that is their loss.
B00005K3NR|5.0|It was watching this movie for the first time as a young lad that I learned what a period was. What a way to start a horror movie! I was never so confused and scared in my life! Watch for John Travolta at the end of his Vinnie Bobarino days. The girls are cute for the most part, but doesn't that girl ever take that cap off?? She even wears it to the prom? Of course the last scene is what everybody loves. At first I didn't like the 'split-screen' effect, because back in the day, you missed someting, but now with DVD and VHS, you can watch one side, rewind and watch the other. That mother's a nut. Watch for those 'dirty pillows'.
B00003CX8J|4.0|The movie \\"X-men\\" is both fun AND a marvelous film, something rare in a movie. The plot is a bit cheesy at times. Who cares! The acting is really great. In my opinion, Patrick Stewart(Star Trek:The Next Generation) did the best acting. There are some faults, though. The movie is heavily changed from the comic history, and for an X-men buff like me, that can be a little dissapointing. Also, some of the acting wasen't all that good. Tyler Mane hammed it up as Sabertooth, and Magneto, too, should of been a little more sinister. Hally Berry's problems weren't her fault. Just a few setbacks. Overall, this is a fantastic movie and I can't wait for X2!
6302561841|5.0|What a flick, and Paulette is BEAUTIFUL!!! Let's see, Charlie goes insane in a factory, look for the 'tweaks' he gives the large bosomed woman! He gets arrested for leading a communist parade (victim of circumstance!) and ends up getting high on coke in the messhall!! Nightwatchman roller skating man says it all. Finally singing waiter. When the movie starts, (and the opening scene says it all) Charlie is just another unhappy 'sheep'. By the end of the movie, he is unemployed and homeless, but he has Paulette and is much happier.
0440236304|5.0|Burgett's memoir was initially published in 1967. It came out when most books on World War II were about generals, or not even about the fighting. Burgett's book was a reminder that war is essentially about young men trying to kill other young men and the hell of it all. I purchased this book when Bantam reissued it under the title \\"As Eagles Screamed.\\" I still have that copy and have read it several times. <BR>All I can say is that if you're picking up this book for the first time, you're in for a treat. If you've already read it, well then you know how good it is. Burgett's books are a fine companion piece to Ambrose's \\"Band of Brothers.\\" In some ways, it's even better because we see the whole war through the eyes of one man who survived it's most horrible moments.
6301969588|4.0|Whoa! That's all you can say after watching this weird, yet hypnotizing flick. Freak after freak are paraded in front of the camera as a tale of love and greed unfolds. I'm sure back in the day, the ending shocked everyone, but by today's standards it was nothing spectacular. It's the freaks themselves that shock the viewer. The pinheads are very disturbing. Watch as a man with no legs and no arms rolls his own cigarette.<br />Basiclly the plot is this. A beautiful (and I mean HOT!) blonde trapeze artist fools a midget into marrying her. All along she has a lover and the two of them are only interested in the midgets fortune and want to kill him. Well the freaks find out and avenge their friend without mercy. The beautiful woman is transformed into a friggin' retarded, legless, chicken! This movie will leave you feeling that you just came down off drugs. Pretty powerful for an early thirties flick. But considering it came from the same guy that directed Frankenstein, it's not that surprising.

B00001QEG5|4.0|Yes folks, it was a sad time indeed, the 80's and all it's glory and silliness was coming to a close. Sadder yet was the fate of Twisted Sister. The monster steam-rolling band that exploded onto the scene, exited with barely a whisper. Gone was the makeup and outrageous outfits. Now they were dressed like leather-clad bikers, but their time was over. Too bad too, considering this was a good album.<br />I remember the day I bought the tape. I was walking home from work and it was pretty damn cold. I had a few bucks to burn, so on the way home I stopped at a record store. Even though 'Love is for Suckers' hadn't been out that long. I walked home listening to it. Back then  when I walked everywhere, my WalkMan was a must have.<br />I remember walking the rest of the way home listening to the first song, 'Wake up the Sleeping Giant'. My favorite tune on the album, great opener. The title track is awesome, as is 'Hot Love', 'Me and the Boys' (ode to the infamous boy's night out and rock n roll) and the touching tongue in cheek) \\"You are all that I need'. Sorry, can't tell you anything about the 'new' tracks, but I'm sure they are good with Dee at the helm.

B00003CXI1|3.0|For those that have read the book, most likely you will find that in the effort to include so much from the book the movie lacks a lot character development.  There's just is not enough time for it.  Read and love the books,  watch and enjoy a fun but standard book to movie conversion.
B00005LKIM|5.0|I AM A FAN OF ANTHONY HOPKINS AND HE DID NOT DISAPPOINT ME WITH<br />THIS SECOND HANNIBAL MOVIE.

B00005QIPH|1.0|The Strokes and their album Is This It are undeniably the biggest hype of the last decade, and while I hate to be the one to burst the bubble, This Ain't It.  All this is is a group of guys who decided to shamelessly ape The Velvet Underground and the Stooges, and while one could certainly pick worse influences to model oneself after, it is nonetheless completely derivative and unimaginative.  The only thing that makes the record stand out is the fact that it sounds different than the glut of sheeny rap-metal and teen pop littering the landscape.<br />I can see how the hype got started and got so many people to buy into it.  First, the predominantly baby boomer and senior Gen X aged writers and critics, feeling warm and fuzzy over the nostalgic sense they got from the Stooges/Velvet 70's sound of the Strokes decided to heap tons of praise on them.  Then all the kids too young to actually know or remember who the hell the Stooges or Velvet Underground were thought the Strokes were fresh and original and bought in.  Bottom line -- Lou Reed and Iggy Pop should be receiving royalties from the Strokes' record.
B00005Y228|4.0|This is the first Kylie Minogue album I've ever owned. Up until &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; came out, I knew little about her and even less about her music, since my true great love was Madonna. But inspired by &quot;Can't Get You..&quot; I had to rush out and buy &quot;Fever&quot; the day it was released here in the states. It was well worth my money, I'll tell you. Besides the obvious appeal of &quot;Can't Get You...&quot; the title track is an excellent littly ditty, perfect dance pop. &quot;Come Into My World&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Dancefloor&quot; are also my faves, not forgetting &quot;Love At First Sight&quot; with all those delicious voice effects I've come to love, very much in the style of Madonna's &quot;Music&quot; album.<BR>Though there are one or two tracks I don't really care for, this is a strong album overall, and just what Kylie needs to finally make a name for herself in the USA. A definate &quot;B+&quot;.<br />Final words: Catch the &quot;Fever&quot; and check out this great album!
B000002ADT|5.0|'Kind of Blue' is one of life's most magical and pleasing listening experiences. If you are just turning yourself on to jazz, then this is probably the most essential album of the genre. The music here simply defines class and cool. I mean, these fellas really tapped something special during these sessions in 1959. It had to have been one of those situations where the chemistry and timing was just perfect. Miles Davis' instantly recognizeable trumpet leads the way as this incredible group of musicians plays through these numbers with all their confidence and self-assertiveness. They say this is something close to pure spontaneity, because the musicians never played any of these pieces prior to the recording. That is a feat in itself. They also say that this is a little taste of heaven, and I'd have to agree to that as well.  This is one of the few pieces of music that I never tire of. I live in downtown Charlotte and this music is perfect for those cool and calm nights when I leave my apartment and just go cruising by myself, going past all the after-hours bars where people mingle, past all the office buildings that soar into the starry-night sky, and through the dimly-lit residential streets; it's really a beautiful thing. I feel good to be alive when I listen to this music. It's laid-back, it's mellow, it's intimate - in a word, it's PERFECT, and probably one of my candidates for greatest album EVER MADE. Trust me when I say it is that good.
B00004X01U|5.0|After the stunning career renaissance of \\"Ray of Light\\", Madonna took 2 1/2 years before she released a follow up, which is what many regard \\"Music\\" as. So when the time finally came to release a new album, you know it had to kick butt.<br />And it did. \\"Music\\" the song, was released to radio in August 2000 and rocketed up the charts. The song's one note bassline (only Madonna can do that much with just one note) the funky retro sounds, that WEIRD voice going \\"Do you like to..boogie woogie?\\" and \\"Do you like my acid rock?\\" was just what her fans, (like I) wanted to hear. With only two verses and a repetitive chorus, Madonna was only FLIRTING with banality, but like the artist she is she made looking weird seem like the best thing ever.<br />\\"Music\\" the album was released the next month, and hit #1 around the world. Besides the slamming title track, \\"Impressive Instant\\" track two, blew everyone away. Once again making her best use of weird computer voices, the little voice saying \\"I'm in a trance!\\" made sure we didn't forget this song. The beat to that song was off the hook, and who can forget \\"I like to singy singy, like a bird on the wingy wingy wingy\\"? The second single, \\"Don't Tell Me\\" was awesome as well, mixing a folksy sound with a just-on-the-cusp-of-danceable tempo.<br />\\"Runaway Lover\\" \\"Amazing\\" and especially \\"Paradise\\" drew heavily on Euro-flavored pop, again using sound effects and weird voices that weren't weird at all, because hey, if Madonna's doing it, it's gotta be cool!<br />This album, though lacking the emotional power of \\"Ray of Light\\" is nonetheless one of the M. Girl's best works, reaffirming her unchallenged crown as Queen of Pop and letting everyone know that, after nearly twenty years, Madonna is still the hippest cat.<br />Hey, I may have been only four months old when her first album was released in July 1983, but I know Madonna and I say this album is definate \\"A\\".
B000001G6W|5.0|This is, in some respects, the finest recording of the Ninth Symphony.  I have come to the conclusion that Herbert von Karajan is, as a conductor, the first classical record producer.  On no other version (that I am aware of- I haven't heard the Gold disc) will you hear so precisely the interplay of the various instrumental parts, and, consequently, the depth of Beethoven's composition.  I swear, to hear the most intricate details of what is REALLY happening in this symphony musically boggles the mind.  Nonetheless, if anyone is to ever enjoy this masterpiece to its fullest extent, it must be understood and conquered in, you guessed it, the recording studio.  This is what makes Herbert von Karajan a visionary.<br />     Still, from an aesthetic perspective, this version leaves me ice cold.  All of the dynamics of his earlier, more popular recording vanish into the last remnants of tape hiss. And, I agree with a review that someone posted on the other disc that, from a certain perspective, Karajan did not understand this work. I am far more moved by the famous Klemperer recording, who, incidentally, claimed that he conducted the symphony almost exactly as Beethoven wrote it.  For that reason, I think that Klemperer was more in tune with the score from a purely scholastic perspective, and consequently, a better musician. Still, the man was ideologically descended from the era of human history that did not know recorded sound. I understand that a million factors need to come together in order to produce a near-perfect recording of this symphony, from the intonation of the second-chair flute to mic placement to the conductor's white bowtie being properly cleaned.  What I'm saying here is that, should someone read this who is willing to try, this version of the Ninth is highly enlightening sonically.  However, because you can hear everything better, you can also hear flaws in execution from, geez, any one of a number of different instrumentalists at any given time, and the overall aesthetic impact is not that of the earlier disc or, as I have mentioned, Klemperer's effort.  So, as a person wanting to be moved by a piece of music, I cannot recommend this version.  As a person who is curious about what Beethoven really wrote and wanted us to hear, I say that this version, world-historically speaking, is a major triumph in the arena of presentation.  Perhaps hearing what was really written into this symphony in its most highly realized form is an impossibility, but on the off-chance you are an aspiring conductor, there's really not much better to do with your life...
B00005U1YO|4.0|I became hooked on the brothers back in 1998 when I borrowed someone's CD player with Dig your Own Hole in it.  Since then I have loved all of their music.  I have since bought all of their cd's, with the exception of Star Guitar, and  see that their music constantly evolves.  When I first heard Surrender, I hated it, because it was unlike Dig Your Own Hole.  This album caught my attention a little more than Surrender off the bat because it starts with a song that is like their older stuff.  While it is much different from some of their previous works, it is some great work.  I love it and I listen to it constantly.  Some will be disappointed by their new songs and style but true fans will appreciate their musical evolution and embrace this groundbreaking record much in the same way that Surrender was embraced once people got used to it.  They are an incredible band and I think that they have had a great run and hope that their live show this year is as great as the '99 show.  Buy this record, you will like it.~~miah
1878574590|5.0|This is the first and best volume in the series.  Great, stark, black &amp; white artwork.  <br />The rest of the series are okay, but Miller doesn't seem to really put the effort into them as he has done with this yarn.<br />Miller must not have done a lot of preliminary sketches for Sin City because you can see the visualization of Marv, the title character evolve as the story progresses. He becomes more massive and Hulk-ish and the violence increases.  <br />Miller did the same thing with THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.  THe visual image of the character seems to be fleshed out as the story goes on.  I think this shows the lack of drawing preparation on Miller's part.  Not important to the story, but I find it interesting to point out.  ~john
B000002542|5.0|I use to listen to this a lot back in the 70s on an 8 track tape player. I also seen Journey live in San Francisco during this period. This is a tribute to the true musical talent behind this group before Steve Perry(not knocking Perry's talent of course). These musicians were offspring of some very good bands such as Santana and Dunbar played with Zappa as well as Flo and Eddie among others. I intend to order this it has been a long time.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I've noticed that some people are complaining about the fact that they can't listen to the LOTR CD on the computer because a webpage opens up when the cd is inserted.  You CAN listen to it.  Just close out the webpage and open up your CD player, winamp, or whatever you use to listen to music.  That worked for me and it should work for you too.  This is a CD NOT to be missed!!
0385484518|1.0|A slim volume of advice that is shallow and insignificant  offered to a writer who is vain and selfish. There are many other, better books that offer insights into ordinary Americans that this one does. Try, At Home in the Heart of Appalacia instead.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I think this soundtrack is terrific. When I grew up in the fifties (yes, in California), I remember being addicted to old time music and listening to it on our tube mono upright phonograph. Of course I didn't realize it was old time music as a little kid. I just knew it was easy to latch onto. This CD reminds me how much the world and popular music as changed.<br />As a kid TV only started to be in peoples homes when I was 3 or 4. Most families had a piano and of all the families living nearby all had kids and or parents that knew how to play. No one back then relied on Madison Avenue to tell them what to like because they just didn't play as prominent a role as today in peoples lives. If you wanted to have music in your life you just learned to sing or play an instrument. And if you were a kid fortunate enough to go to camp during the summer you got a big dose of music there also.<br />Growing up in a religious family you naturally got acquainted with music. I'm not a religious person anymore but the album sure takes me back. I think back when there was no TV, or internet people needed more solace in their lives and music was and is a direct link to that. Even the most upbeat toetapping songs on this album (&quot;I am a man of constant sorrow&quot;) have the most brooding dark lyrics you can imagine - its a direct link to how hard life could be in the depression - and for blacks long before that. I remember singing songs in Sunday School at 4 or 5 years of age about heavenly rewards and such without thinking much about it at the time. Now I look back on it and I see in those experiences my parents dark view of how hard life can be and that you shouldn't look for rewards in this life. It's a very pervasive emotion behind a lot of music. The simple expression of the emotion in song is what lifts the spirit. You don't have to be religious to understand it but it does help if you've had exposure to it at sometime in your life. Like I say, I'm not religious and never goto church but this soundtrack just bypasses my brain and goes direct to the heart. I can't help but feel a little sorry for people who can't appreciate the simple joy of this album.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie was entertaining, exciting, and just plain wonderful.  Of special note; my grandson, who is a Harry Potter expert, could only find two or three deviations from the book.  We went to the film as a family, Granddad, Grandmother, Dad, Mom, Son, Daughter, and Aunt.  All 7 of us were delighted.  It rate at the top, along with classics such as Wizard of OZ, Tales of Narnia, and Lord of the Rings.  Hooray for such a delightful family film.
B00005JKT8|4.0|It was just like reading a romance novel.  So don't expect anything more and you won't be disappointed.  Hugh Jackman was terrific as the hero.  I think some other actress could have done a better job than Meg Ryan, though.  She didn't seem to do justice to the part, and it was left to Hugh Jackman to carry the load (which he did).  This is a light, feel-good movie.  Enjoy it!  I did.
B00000K19E|5.0|I'm not a big sci-fi freak, so I was reluctant to get this.  After positive word-of-mouth, I purchased the dvd.  I LOVE IT!!!  Keanu Reeves is great, Carrie Anne Moss is great, Laurence Fishburne is excellent!  The fighting scenes are superb, crazy \\"running on the walls\\" usually seen in  karate action movies.  The plot was totally unique, like nothing I've ever seen before.  The dvd has a lot of cool extras, like commentary by Carrie-Anne Moss and the directors.
B00004RFFU|4.0|If there was any doubt that a horror movie could be great and not campy, Interview with the Vampire is it! Beautifly photographed, seductive in its tone and a visually stunning piece. Tom Cuise and Brad pit played there parts perfectly in there roles as the torchered Loiue(Pitt) and as the matter of fact slightly insane Lestat(Cruise). If Jack Nicholeson ever desides to hang up the phycho role, leave no doubt that Tom Cruise can easily fil his role as unbalanced and crazy, just chech out the scene when he is dancing  with a corps and at the piano after his brush with death. Kurstin Duntz proved what a great actress she is and will continue to be and Antonio Bandares with his small role was mezmerizing! The ending with Tom and Christian Slater Was to cool not to love! All in all, A great flick!!
B0000048YO|4.0|\\"Gilda\\" is the most misogynistic Hollywood film you'll ever see. It portrays social and business relationships among men as honorable and equitable -- regardless of which side of the law the men are on -- with women constantly trying to corrupt those relationships. The film repeatedly spells out -- without subtlety or ambiguity -- that women are poison.<br />Gilda \\"ought\\" to end with everyone dead, but Johnny and Gilda finally realize they have no good reason to hate each other, and walk off into the sunset. It's almost plausible, but the sudden cleaning-up of their dirty characters -- in which our faces have been rubbed for the preceding 100 minutes -- isn't believable. This is surprising in a script that's notable for its brilliant, multi-layered writing.<br />The principals -- Hayworth, Ford, Macready -- are terrific. Ford -- whom we tend to think of as playing nice guys -- brings a believably nasty, amoral \\"edge\\" to the part.<br />The DVD is very good, but not great. Although the transfer is a restoration sponsored by Sony, more than a few scenes are dark and a bit muddy. Don't expect quality up to, say, the recent \\"Citizen Kane.\\"
B000002OX7|5.0|I don't know how someone can write music this good.  Any album that you can simply sit down in front of your stereo and listen to deserves five stars, and this is that type of album.  Though Lifehouse died out, Who's Next is still able to tell a pretty cool story.  Though I dig the Beatles, you have to admit that &quot;Won't be fooled again&quot; is about 6,000,000 times better a political song than &quot;Revolution.&quot;<br /><br />I strongly advise anyone and everyone to listen to this album a few times at the very least.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
0060926317|1.0|Although the later issues of this book identify the story as a fictional account (on the back cover) Marlo Morgan intentionally confuses her readers by insisting in her Foreword that she has portrayed this story in novel form in order to protect the Aborigines who allegedly abducted her.<BR>I think an author owes it to the reader to be straightforward about the book's basic premise.  Morgan's coyness with respect to this important issues undermines what little credibility exists in this highly implausible story.<BR>Credibility issues aside, Morgan seems to heap one unbelievable premise upon another.  The reader is asked to accept Aboriginal characters who speak as if they were Oxford grads, and to tolerate a clumsy concoction of &quot;Mrs. Kansas Pageant&quot; casserole cooking anecdotes and New Age cliches.  The result is an amateurish portrayal that grows goofier as it progresses. If you wish to read books that deal with the same issues in a more professional manner, try something by Anne Morrow Lindbergh,<BR>Izaak Walton, or Henry David Thoreau.
080013558X|5.0|Now this is the movie that every little girl needs to see!  It shows that even little girls can survive in a big adult world.  I wanted to be Annie so much, I owned all the dolls, the record soundtrack (yes we had only vinyl back then), the Annie record player, and even made my mom watch the movie for ours on end.  Now I still have all my dolls, own the CD soundtrack and can tell you verbatim the entire movie script! hahaha  It's a confidence boosting movie for any little girl, especially ones like me who are going through a tough time at that age.  If you see this movie before or even after Disney's butchering version of the play you will agree this is a much better adaptation.  The characters are more believable and Carol Burnette is a riot.  It's a must see for those young and young at heart!
B00005QDW1|2.0|This album sounds like the songs were written to target different demographic and musical segments.  Let's see, one song for the hip hop fans, another for rock and so on and so on...It's all so canned and programmed.  Give it a skip and buy the earlier albums.
B00003CXDZ|2.0|Nicole & Ewan do terrific impersonations of Ann-Margret & Donny Osmond. Respectively, by the way. Very Vegas.
6300216039|5.0|This version is by far the best one I've seen.  The acting is great, the set is superb, the music is wonderful, I could go on all day.  This is a video to be veiwed only if you have a box of tissues within  half an arm's reach, especially if you're like me. (I was tearing from the balcony scene all the way to the ending credits!)  One part made me laugh, though.  At one point, Juliet is kneeling on the floor crying next to the nurse.  She then falls over and out of camera veiw.  All you hear is &quot;*flop* WAAAHHHH!&quot;  Ok, what I'm trying to say is this: look no further, this, by definition, is the quintessential Romeo and Juliet.
8439702469|1.0|When I read most of the reviews here I was truly in shock.  I sincerely urge the persons who wrote them to read authors like Vargas Llosa, Alejo Carpentier, Garcia Marquez, Borges, Jorge Edwards, Cortazar, etc, etc.  Latin America has been prolific with great literature.  Do not waste time with this book, please.  Estoy segura que los adictos a la verdadera y rica literatura en espanol estan de acuerdo conmigo.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Do not be afraid of this movie as a result of the bad reviews.. this is a great movie.  Most of the Bad reviews are from folks who think they are joe pro movie and don't like lynch, my question to them: If you know good movies so well why are writing comments on amazon and Lynch is directing major films. To have a cult following like Lynch you gotta be doing something right. Lynch films are not for everyone, but don't let some arrogant person's negative feedback keep you from this movie.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I listened to this album all the way through nearly five times. I tried to understand what all the commotion was about, alas I couldnt find anything other than [terrible] songs. This album is absolutely pathetic. I think that every one is just jumping on the bandwagon in an attempt to be hip. This is just sad. The saviors of rock are Iced Earth. not these clowns.
B00005Y228|5.0|Ok guys!  This is the best pop cd EVER!  I rediscovered Kylie on a trip to Chicago last year, heard the title track of her Light Years cd and was hooked!  This cd is definetly going to make Kylie a superstart here in the States.  There is not one bad track on this cd, stand outs are In Your Eyes, Fever, Your Love, Burning Up, and of course Can't Get You Out of My Head, her best song ever!  If you are new to Kylie, this cd is a great introduction to her, feel the Fever with Kylie!  After listening to this cd, you will want more, more, more Kylie!  :-)
B00003CX5P|5.0|...I'll admit: \\"The Phantom Menace\\" wasn't the greatest Star Wars movie ever made...but it wasn't horrible! And yes, I hated Jar Jar Binks like most of you but I didn't hold that one character against my feelings toward this movie. And of course this is not like the old Star Wars trilogy--that trilogy was Luke Skywalker's story. Now we are onto the trilogy which gives us Anakin Skywalker's story on why and how he becomes Darth Vader. I mean, after all, he wasn't BORN Darth Vader! It was sort of unfair that \\"The Phantom Menace\\" received an overwhelmingly ancticipation of media hype so of course it could not live up to everyone's expectations (we all had different expectations, I'm sure). But it did satisfy me, which is a good thing because I am a big Star Wars fan. Of course I loved the old trilogy but I'm also learning to love and appreciate the new trilogy, unlike some stubborn Star Wars fans. <br />The action sequences were awesome...and even the acting was pretty good. The dialouge and plot were okay, but who sees Star Wars for the dialouge?! Yes, the robots and animated characters/scenes were a little cheesy but I'm sure Lucasfilm did their best. I rate this movie 4/5 stars and the DVD a solid 5.<br />This DVD is one of the best DVDs ever with over 600 hours of \\"The Making of 'The Phantom Menace'\\", documentaries made by George Lucas, featurettes, CD-ROM extras, Web documentaries, and tons more! It also includes the original \\"Phantom Menace\\" trailer, and picture-perfect sound and quality. <br />If you are a true Star Wars fan, then this DVD is highly recommended. I can't wait for \\"Attack of the Clones\\"!
B00005TT77|5.0|I saw the movie the other day and I was scared when I realized people would be re-doing Beatles songs. But I was really, really impressed. I've heard my fair share of Beatles remakes, but these songs are innovative, fresh, yet true to the original beauty that is the beatles. It was a really diverse, great-sounding soundtrack. i'd recommend it for any beatles fans!
0553274503|5.0|I read this story in its original form as a short story.  I really liked it then.  It was different and original.  How many stories have you read where the first few chapters are grossly misspelled and carry the tone of innocent child?  Almost 10 years later, I decided to revisit this story in its lengthened book form.  I love it even more.<br />Flowers for Algernon is a collection of progress reports, similar to diary entries, by Charlie Gordon.  Charlie [has an IQ of 60 and] works at a bakery when the story starts.  He is motivated to do what he can to learn how to read and write so that he can be smart like the people around him.  Through an evening adult learn-to-read class, Charlie is introduced by his teacher Alice Kinnian to Professor Nemur and Dr. Strauss, a psychiatrist and a neurosurgeon, respectively.  Nemur and Strauss are searching for a subject to perform an intelligence enhancing operation on, which up to that point has only been tried on a mouse named Algernon.  They pick Charlie because of his friendly nature and tenacity to learn.  The operation is a success and slowly Charlie's intelligence begins to increase.  He slowly comes to undertand the world around him.  Before when people laughed at him, he laughed with them and considered them his friends.  Now he realizes they were just making fun of him.  He's also slowly unlocking the repressed memories deep in his mind of his childhood and trying to understand them.  Why did his parents send him away when he was younger?  Why does Norma (Matt and Rose Gordon's second child of normal intelligence) hate her so much?  As Charlie's IQ increases he realizes that people around him aren't as smart as he thought they were before the operation.  Slowly he surpasses them in intellect until he begins to alienate himself from the people around him.  He is alone again.  There's so much more left to tell about this story, but I could never do it justice with this summary.  I would urge the reader to read for themselves and be moved.<br />Ultimately Flowers for Algernon is a very sad story.  And as the subject of my review states, I was reduced to tears.  In fact, the last two pages of this book unlocked a torrent of emotions I never knew a book could.  To me, this book is singular in that sense.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Although snickering movie critics say that Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay's Spring 2001 release of \\"Pearl Harbor\\" was a bomb, I tend to disagree. Critics state that the four category Oscar nominated film focused on the romance part and not so much the events leading up to, during and after the attack on Pearl Harbor. But, didn't \\"Titanic\\" focus on romance for two hours, then the ship sank and the movie ended? It still won, what, 11 Academy Awards? I enjoyed the film, because it was dynamic and even though the actors didn't really have a great part for one another, they really acomplished their character. The cast was huge and well chosen and the music was tops for that certain type of movie. The visual and sound effects were tremendous and every crew member did their part. I think that the film should deserve more recognition and more praise for its on-screen heroics.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|this movie was amazing. although i never want to see it again because it was so disturbing, it's one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. the acting was magnificent, the story was gripping, and the cinematography was chilling.

At the beginning you have no idea what going on till you get to \\"Your Song.\\"  Why you ask?  because Ewan sucks you in with his amazing voice and beautiful smile that will melt an iceberg!!  I don't care about Nicole Kidman, Ewan was the one you'll be watching the most, and I think he was the main character not her! While watching this movie I got goose bumbs sooooo bad, especially during \\"Le Tang de Roxanne,\\" this song was so powerful to me it just moved me and this song made me love this movie.  Don't download it right now you have to wait to see it until you can love it!  I can't tell you why to watch this movie, but in the end you'll be glad you did.  After watching this movie I am inspired to become an actor hopefully as good as Ewan.  GO WATCH THIS MOVIE AND CHEER EWAN McGREGOR ON!!!!!!
B00003CX8J|5.0|When I saw \\"X-Men\\" at the theater in the summer of 2000, I was quite surprised for the hard work that director Bryan Singer (\\"The Usual Suspects\\") has put into this movie. Singer did not just a good job, but an outstanding job with the special effects and the storytelling and such. As far as the acting goes, Patrick Stewart (\\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\") was an excellent choice as Professor Xavier. In fact, I knew that they would pick Stewart for this role. And as for Hugh Jackman (who appeared in 1998's \\"Paperback Hero\\" prior to doing \\"X-Men\\") as Logan/Wolverine, Jackman was brilliant! We all know that Hugh Jackman is from Australia, and that \\"X-Men\\" was his first American production. But when Jackman gets right down to talking in that American accent, he does it with perfection all the way! And that is what makes Jackman the actor that he is today, with lots of charisma and style as well. The supporting cast, including Ian McKellen (Magneto), Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Anna Paquin (Rogue), Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (Mystique), Tyler Mane (Sabertooth), and Ray Park (Toad) gave great performances as well! The DVD transfer of this was simply amazing! Especially with features like Hugh Jackman's screen test, deleted scenes, trailers, TV spots, behind the scenes footage, and much more! \\"X-Men\\" is the best comic book adaption ever made since \\"Superman\\" and \\"Batman\\"! I cannot wait for the \\"X-Men\\" sequels to come out! But until that time comes, I will still enjoy watching \\"X-Men\\" for years to come.
B000002VMH|5.0|Daniel Durchholz doesn't get it.  Its probably not his fault. He may need a couple years.  He probably doesn't like Billie Holliday or Bob Dylan or maybe even Frank Sinatra either.<br />This album is fabulous.  It is the CD for a 150 mile car ride, your wife at your side, listening to life experienced.  Both of you understanding Annie - the distance you've traveled and the affects of mileage. It is clear, extraordinarily well produced and moving. It breathes with you as you drive.<br />No one needs to tell Annie Lennox when its time. She's been there and is looking back. Years and life will make anyone appreciate this album.
B00002DGZJ|4.0|This CD isn't really that different than the regular American version. It Has pretty much all the same songs (only 6 are in spanish) But anyway the tracks are as fallows :<BR>1. No Me Ames [Duo Con Marc Anthony] 4:36 (original spanish)              <BR>2. If You Had My Love [Si Tuvieras Mi Amor] 4:26 (original)      <BR>3. Una Noche Mas 4:06 (original spanish)                               <BR>4. Should've Never [No Debiera] 6:15 (original)                <BR>5. Es Amor* 4:41 (previously un-released)(spanish)             <BR>6. Let's Get Loud [Pongamonos Estridentes] 4:00 (original)     <BR>7. It's Not That Serious [No Es Tan Serio] 4:16 (original)      <BR>8. Amar Es Para Siempre* 3:53 (spanish vers. of &quot;Promise Me You'll Try&quot;) <BR>9. Too Late [Demasiado Tarde] 4:28 (original)                     <BR>10. El Deseo De Tu Amor* 3:38 (spanish vers. of &quot;Open Off My Love&quot;) <BR>11. Talk About Us [Hablemos De Nosotros] 4:25 (original)          <BR>12. Could This Be Love [Podria Esto Ser Amor] 4:26 (original)     <BR>13. No Me Ames (Duo Con Marc Anthony) [Remezcla Tropical] 5:03 (original) <BR>Like I said all of the tracks are the same as the US edition of this cd the only differenc are trakcs #5, #8, &amp; #10. Tracks 8 &amp; 10 being covers of her english songs, they sound just like the english versions, (but sound way better in spanish than in english), # 5 is an original recording in spanish, its a ballad. Over all this cd is basically the same as the original release (thats why I give it 4 stars) and all the songs are in english except tracks 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, &amp; 13.
B000002N2Z|5.0|The Deftones have been one of my favorite bands for a long time. Why? They create awesome music that trancends any specific genres (\\"nu-metal,\\" \\"emo-core,\\" \\"rap rock\\") they might be shoved into by critics. Although I like all Deftones albums equally, Adrenaline has been getting the most listens lately because of its bold originality, and songs that are incredibly simple, yet very complex at the same time.<br />At first listen, you may very well think that you've landed on another \\"bad nu metal\\" band. And I can totally accept that. As I said earlier, the songs are very simple, and rely on as few riffs as possible, with Chino mumbling lyrics using a very um... unique vocal style. The drum beats are really nothing out of the ordinary; the usual 4/4 with a little syncopation here and there. Chi, the bass player, would be the lead instrumentalist, except the CD's mixed in a way that he's drowned out by the sharp, short riffs concocted by Stephan, the guitarist. With instrumentalization like that you really would expect Adrenaline to [stink]. But each musician somehow molds into the others' style of playing, giving the Deftones that organic element that makes them sound a million times better. The music may [stink], but it [stinks] with a passion, it [stinks] so much that it's GREAT MUSIC, the heavier incarnation of Far and Sunny Day Real Estate, and the softer incarnation of Nothingface and Will Haven. The sheer power of each song is really unexplainable, but somehow works in its mysterious ways to make this one of my favorite CD's ever.<br />If you want a more understandable album from the Deftones, or are uninitiated into the ranks of 'Toneheads, I suggest you buy White Pony (or Around the Fur if you're more of a metalhead). But if you crave a mystery, music that you can't really put your finger on, do not hesitate to buy Adrenaline.
0345440803|1.0|Tracy Hogg sound like a selfish person who only wants to get rid of her kids so she can write more books and make more money. You should pick up, hug, cuddle, and love those little ones and don't ignore them because if you do you will get spoild brats.
B00005Y228|5.0|In the more than a decade since Kylie's last US release, she has tranformed through many stages, some more fruitful than others.  Fever finds her on the dancefloor, where we last left her with the stellar 2000 import release, Lightyears.  &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head,&quot; the infectious lead single is all over the radio in a way that &quot;The Locomotion&quot; never was, and with good reason.  Featuring a nostalgic, 80's style beat with new wave and post electronica flourishes, the song's title is self-descriptive.  Other tracks fair just as well, from the percussive stop and start of the title track to the cool groove of the 2nd European single, &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; Fever bounces along on tight grooves and lovley vocal moments that should dominate the charts for some time.  If Minogue can duplicate her European success in the states, then she will be here for a long time.<br />Included on limited quantities of the first pressing are two excellent bonus tracks.  &quot;Boy&quot; comes from the import single for &quot;CGYOMH&quot; and stands up as a very strong album track.  Why this was ever relegated to the no-where land of the b-sides originally is beyond me.  &quot;Butterfly&quot; is an outtake from Lightyears and has already made some head way as a smash dance single.  Kylie brings the Fever, and it may be the cure for the pre-processed teen-pop that has been dominating the airwaves for the last few years.  Viva Kylie!<br />For those of you who get into this album, but find it occasionally repetitive, it would serve you well to check out the 1998 release, Impossible Princess, also known as the dark covered self-titled album.  Kylie was riding on a wave of alternative inspired pop at this time and turned out her strongest, most diverse album to date, which left critics babbling their appreciation, and fans slightly confused, as it was a much more challenging album than most of her pop oriented material.  Definitely one to check out.
B00003CXAA|1.0|I was looking forward to watching this classic on DVD, so when it became available from my local library, I checked it out. Obviously, the picture quality was much clearer than on VHS, but I must agree with a few other reviewers who noticed that the transfer to DVD just made everything TOO DARK! The first half of Part II, especially the night scenes after the attack on the compound, are practically unwatchable they're so dark. I never had this problem on my VHS version. Here's an example. When Johnny Ola comes to visit Mike at the beginning of Part II, he hands Mike an orange, and Mike asks, &quot;What's this?&quot; Johnny Ola replies, &quot;An orange from Miami.&quot; On my VHS version, you can clearly see the orange, but on the DVD, it's so damn dark that you don't even know Johnny handed something to Mike! You can't even make out their faces! This particular example is minor, but it gives you an idea of other problems that are prevalent throughout all the discs. I eventually got so frustrated I took the disc out and finished watching it on my VHS, graininess and all. At least I could make out people's faces in some of the especially dark scenes! Hopefully when the next edition comes out they will recify this problem. In the meantime, BUYER BEWARE!
0451457994|5.0|Sorry...I am speechless. One of the best books I've read. ENJOY!
B000002UAC|4.0|This sophomore effort by the Beatles followed the same format (some would say formula) of their debut: an eclectic mix of eight originals and six covers.  At the same time, they went for an earthier, more rock'n'roll sound with less of Please Please Me's occasional schmaltz.  &quot;It Won't Be Long&quot;, &quot;All I've Got to Do&quot; and the #1 hit &quot;All My Loving&quot; are great Lennon/McCartney originals; the best of the covers are Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' &quot;You Really Got a Hold on Me&quot; and a rip-roaring version of &quot;Money&quot;.  Paul's rendition of &quot;Til There Was You&quot; (from the musical The Music Man) is a pleasant surprise.  Though A Hard Day's Night would be the crowning achievement of the Beatles' early days, With the Beatles is a great album and an essential part of any music collection.
B0000009RT|5.0|This is a really cool album with lots of really cool songs
B00000ILDE|5.0|Quite simply, this has to be one the best &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; movies ever made. Cruising with Ridley Scott as he explores the darker side of terra-forming and seeing, for the &quot;first&quot; time, what this actually encompasses has some great, character-driving qualities which other cuts lacked. Personally, seeing Newt's family before as they introduce our Xeno-hero to those &quot;juicy colonist daughters&quot; definitely gives her more oomph. Combining this with newly revised scenes recounting the tales of Ripley's daughter, some nice pictures of the equipment used on that wonderful wasteland of a planet, and the almighty autoguns gives the viewer something that lacked with other released versions. It gives them a clearer window to see everyone's favorite extraterrestrial (with explanations given on Alien ecology that were left out of the Alien that explain the breeding cycle and the roles of the drone) as they fight the good fight against that consuming human blight.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minogue returns stateside and &quot;Fever&quot; features some of the best pop-dance tunes of her career. The global hit &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; is only the beginning with fun being the order of the day and it never stops.<br />Taking its lead from the single the rest of the album is full of topline production and a host of single-ready tunes. Standout tracks include &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; already a number one single in Kylie's native Australia, &quot;Come Into My World&quot; and &quot;Love At First Sight&quot;. Also noteworthy is the very interesting &quot;Burning Up&quot; which fluctuates between near-ballad moments and &quot;burning&quot; dancefloor highs. <br />In recent years, Kylie has rediscovered her fun side and has found her point of differentiation from the other pop diva's.  The most fun you'll have in 2002...Go KYLIE!
0140177396|4.0|John Steinbecks story is about two men, Lenny and George, trying to make a living on their own. Smart and witty George finds them jobs, but Lennie has a tendens of messings up things even if he doesnt want to. Of mice and men is a stor of two friends sharing a common dream. But this dream reaches a terrible climax at the end of the book.. Really a good book !
B000001E7V|5.0|Maxinque is defintely an interesting album. It took me a few times to really appreciate the album. The album is a creative work with strong tracks like hell's around the corner and black steel. Tricky was supposed to be part of this whole 'electronic revolution' a few year back in 1997. The revolution never happened sadley I guess because otherwise more people would have been able to hear tricky.
B00005QIPH|5.0|It's funny how a lot kids who spend the majority of their time  listening to indie and punk bands feel the need to tear down any band from that genre that widely receives critical acclaim and attention from the mainstream press. I happen to be somebody who listens to that kind of music on a regular basis. On the other hand, I am not such a music snob that I cannot give recognition to something that is obviously great simply because the band in question happens to be well-liked by more than one person in my area code. Yes the Strokes do look cool, but why is that something to hold against them? The lyrics have substance although the are not cryptic poetry, Julian is an interesting and talented singer with one of the best voices to come along in a while, and the music is full of great riffs and solos that swagger while knowing when to show restraint. I saw the band live and I can tell you that although this album is one of the year's best, they are far better in person. This is no rock opera, but Julian weaves little personal tales with his lyrics full of frustration, anger, alienation, and some sadness in turns sincere and suddenly flippant. The Strokes are full of energy and passion for this music and when you hear this album, even if it's not the hip thing to say, you'll know that the band is making this music because they love it and they believe in its power and validity. I do too.
B00005O5CM|3.0|From start to finish, Legally Blonde was an enjoyable piece of brain candy.  It is not a profound film, a biting satire, or a gripping drama.  It is what it is....fluff.  Having been in a sorority before, I know that the film's treatment of Elle's beloved Delta Nu is over the top, but little else is, including her treatment at the hands of the Harvard law student body.  <br />The film has its high points...the liposuction conversation, Elle arriving at Harvard for orientation (Woods, comma Elle), and her conversation with her family about her future.  It has its low points as well...and its low points are VERY low indeed.  I know Elle needed a friend, but why on earth did they pick a dowdy, stupid beautician to be her friend?  My god, that woman was irritating.  The &quot;bend and snap&quot; scene shouldn't have just been left out of the film, it should have been burned so it couldn't be included in a future director's cut.  <br />The film is predictable....you know Elle will win back her snobbish boyfriend, you know she'll win over the Harvard elite, and you know going into the film's final scenes that she will easily win the case.<br />This film is great fun on a dreary Sunday afternoon when there's nothing else on.  I wouldn't buy it unless you're a big Reese Witherspoon fan...if you're not, I'd save my money and just rent it from Blockbuster.
B00003CX9E|5.0|In a word, yes.  'Citizen Kane' is not only the best American film of all time, how it was born is one of the great all-time stories of film.  <br />The plot of the film, the rise and fall of multi-millionaire and newspaper emperor Charles Foster Kane, is known to most fans of film...So what makes it so great?  I think lots of people will tell you that Welles' innovative camera angles, beautiful cinematography, great Mercury Players all contribute to the brilliance of the film.  For me, though, no film has ever been a better study of the best and worst of human nature.  Kane (and Welles too, for that matter) was an extremely gifted man who was able to control nearly everything he touched.  What so many of us wouldn't give to have what Kane had.  Kane never asks the question on-screen, but you know what is going through his mind:  &quot;Is this all there is?&quot;  What a powerful study of a man of power and influence.  <br />'Citizen Kane' is such a film of staggering proportions, it has been imitated countless times, but never equalled.  Welles truly was a genius and even if he never surpassed 'Kane' himself, the film will continue to live on as the standard against which all other films are measured.  It is truly greatness.<br />But there's more.  'The Battle Over Citizen Kane,' the second disc is just as great as the feature.  The story behind the film is an amazingly informative and entertaining feature.  See how 'Kane' came to life and how it almost died before it was ever born.  An amazing tale.  Add to this the commentaries by Peter Bogdonavich and Roger Ebert and you have a DVD set that no movie-lover can pass up.  I can't think of a better gift for anyone who loves classic films.  BUY IT!
630179513X|5.0|The three films have to be watched one after the other. They are a whole. They are first of all and above all a marvellous piece of entertainment with two elements that come back as salient characteristics. First Biff and his transformation in time according to various accidents in the time line. A bully remains a bully even when circumstances tame him slightly. The second is a reference to Clint Eastwood in the funniest possible way. It is crucial in the end, but you have to discover the twist. The first film's trip to the past is kind of pulpy because it is an intervention in the parents life, when they are teenagers and the question is how can the son help the parents get together and become the progenitors the son needs to exist. A trip into the past that changes slightly the present, but with no serious consequences. The second film is heftier in that sense that a trip to the future causes a twist in the time line that requires a new trip to the past to correct the twist. Funny because the three time periods are mixing in the most hilarious way. The third film is for pleasure. It is about the retrieving party that is supposed to bring Doc back to the present from his very distant nineteenth century past. He will not come back, except for a visit later on. The time machine will also be destroyed and things will come back to normal, except maybe for Doc Emmet Brown, but he likes the change.<br />This film deals with time, the present, the past and the future and beyond the entertaining aspect it is deeply reflexive. First, time must not be changed in anyway without tremendous consequences. We must not play with time. Second, the travels in the past show how things have changed from one period to the next, from the past, no matter which, to the present. Some of the questions are serious, like the future of black people in 1955. The answer is in 1985. Just as serious is the fate or future of bullies if by any chance they get power, that is to say money. We must stand our ground in front of them to keep them in their place, the margins of society, a tolerated existence and not a dominant position. Just as serious is also the question about heredity : one generation always reproduces what the previous generation has done. A bully has to be born from a family of bullies even if circumstances can guide the realisation of this bully-ness. Then the position of science in our society is extremely fragile because it may disturb the flux of history with some unforeseen and unforeseeable invention that is the result of some crazy imagination in some mad scientist. We must both trust and question science in our society. The films are optimistic provided science is kept in its place, that is to say the margin of history, otherwise catastrophes can occur. Finally, travelling in time is funny and the stories of such travels have to be hilarious and the films are superb.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUnd our ground in front of them to keep them in their place, the margins of society, a tolerated existence and not a dominant position.

0790742322|4.0|It was on the other night, and, having been a big fan of the cartoon when it was being shown, decided to watch it (I'm also trying to see all the Winona Ryder movies I know.). <br /> It's a well known fact i like seeing her [Winona Ryder] dance at the end of a movie (hey, it's funny!), but apart from that, it was just a hilarious film and i liked it very much. The only thing  wrong was that it was too short. Maybe the special efects were a bit &quot;off&quot;, but hey, it's an older movie1
B000050FEN|4.0|I stop short of five stars for two reasons.  A.) Kevin Spacey, the psycho around which the film revolves, has only a few minutes of screen time.  B.) We don't get to see enough of Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt together onscreen to understand the dynamics of their relationship.  Brad Pitt's dialogue could have been better as well...some lines were just awkward.<br />That being said, the film is deliciously gruesome, cruel, and dark.  It presents both the ugliest sides of New York and humankind and makes no apologies for making your stomach turn.  The premise is brilliant as well...I've seen plenty of 'whodunnits' but nobody has ever thought of weaving in the seven deadly sins (hence the name, Seven).  It was brilliant, and the murders themselves were very creative indeed.  <br />This edition of the DVD is the best one.  It's a two-disc set containing storyboards, director's commentary, and much more.  It's so popular here in England that the studio eventually released the same 2 disc version over here, but only in a limited edition.  I'm sure it will be a huge seller for years to come.

6305161879|2.0|NOTE: This review is about the 1998 version of the DVD. Newer releases may be better quality.<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />This film is definitely on my top ten list of funniest movies of all time, with \\"Some Like it Hot,\\" \\"National Lampoons Christmas Vacation\\" and the Monty Python masterpieces...<br /><br />But this DVD is atrocious. The soundtrack is all in the center channel... haven't heard anything worse since I gave up watching a TV with a 3 inch speaker. The theme song is burbled and warbly. There is no separation -- even to the front speakers. The dialog is flat as a flitter.<br /><br />The picture quality is a hair better than off the air, rabbit ear antennae reception. At times the picture is choppy and halting -- as if you were watching it on a rental video that has been viewed too many times.<br /><br />The only extra is the film's trailer.<br /><br />Wait for a re-release before buying!
