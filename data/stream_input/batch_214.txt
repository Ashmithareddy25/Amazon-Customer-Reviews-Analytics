B000JLAWIA|1|As many others have stated on other colognes that they bought, the box was already opened, and the unique code inside was taken out. I *think* the cologne itself is fine, but the bottle is VERY dusty, as if it was sitting naked in a warehouse for a long time.
B00H6YRB0K|4|This mirror is great.  I have to run it under the water a few times per my usual ten minute shower to de-fog the mirror, but otherwise it's great.  I've cleaned it a few times in the last couple months with some Windex and it's just fine.
B000BYNENU|5|Extremely natural looking....goes on with no color.  No transfer on clothes sheets.  I am a male and have been self tanning for years.  This product is as easy as applying lotion and looks like a natural looking tan.  LOVE IT.
B00K7JWW3M|5|Excellent product very effective
B00GIXIELU|3|Does it really work...
B00B3QWS0U|3|Cute hair clip.  My only complaint is that it is harder to clip in than most others I have purchased.  The packaging was nice though.
B006YMZSZK|4|I ordered this veil five days before my wedding as a spontaneous, \\"maybe I really do want a veil\\" purchase. I found out when it shipped on a Monday that it was coming from china. I was nervous that I wouldn't get it by Friday like I needed. Not only did it come by Wednesday, but out looked great when I put it on. Out really did add the finishing touch to my wedding that I wanted
B001AO0WCG|5|I read about this product in a magazine.  When I went to a new beauty shop the stylist used this on my hair.  We talked about this product and I was really pleased with the results.  I then looked it up on the internet and found the best deal.  I received it in a couple of days and have been using it ever since.
B002RXK1UC|3|ok for what I am using it for.
B0039UTO5A|5|Beautiful lashes... You don't need to apply very much at all. Super effective!
B004M6J8RE|5|I used to sell this product and for the past 3 years it is the only foundation I can wear-so happy to have received it so quickly and at such an affordable price!
B001LFM4WA|5|Works great for the kids to moisturize the skin while they play in the bath.  Saves time afterwards by not having to lotion.
B000980PGC|5|Product works well for me. We live in a dry Colorado climate and this product doesn't strip my skin of all moisture and oils.
B00M89ONZO|5|I like it
B000050B6B|5|For a while, I was having trouble finding this model of head for some reason.  Was glad to see these for sale at a reasonable price.  I was thinking of going to a safety blade and brush but this is still way more convenient.
B00028LN1K|4|I have Palmar-plantar (hands and feet) psoriasis.  While my soles require a much more labor intensive regime of creams, tar oil, and everything else that goes into managing it, I find this soap is all I need to keep at bay the small patches on my hands.  I wash my hands and feet with this soap at least in the morning and before I go to bed.  The smell, however, is strong.  It smells like my wood smoker!!!  I know it works because I was having trouble controlling the small flair ups on my hands, and that stopped as soon as I started using this product.<br /><br />I don't think there is a silver bullet cure for this pesky and painful ailment, but I met with a dermatologist who took the time to discuss supplements.  He led me to some medical reviews of Omega 3 fish oil and Vitamin D supplements as they pertained to Psoriasis treatment.  My previous dermatologist ran an assembly-line office where he looked at the Psoriasis, prescribed some skin softener and steroid cream, and was out the door to his next patient.  On my questions regarding alcohol and diet he said \\"anything that promotes a healthy lifestyle is good.\\"  However, when I met with a doctor who actually sat down and discussed long term treatment, I came up with a better plan.  I've been taking the supplements for a few weeks and there is a considerable decrease in flair ups, though managing my Psoriasis is a never ending process, even if it is mostly cleared up at the moment.  The second I neglect treatment, back it will come.  Don't despair;  through some trial and error, Psoriasis can be managed a lot of the time.  This soap can be part of the solution.
B0042T07N0|4|The fair covers up the brusies and varicose veins well, but it does make me look very, very fair. I mix with the medium for a better color.
B000UEAARO|3|This is too expensive for oatmeal to me.  Though its messier, its much cheaper to put oatmeal in nylons or socks and rubberband it for the tub.
B004BD8QEO|2|I've never been a big fan of electric shavers. Lately, I've gotten lazy in the mornings, and started using the Braun mobile shaver instead of shaving cream and a blade. After using it for a couple of weeks, the convenience grew on me, so I decided to invest in a good electric shaver. I did some research, and decided on the Braun 7-720 shaver.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me, it does not seem to work any better than the much less expensive mobile shaver. In comparison, the mobile shaver which costs under $25 did a great job. It was just as good as this one, which cost me $180.<br /><br />So, I'm returning the expensive one and sticking with the cheaper one. Seems to me like more expensive and fancy isn't always better than less expensive and simple.
B00FQQYJKK|5|Bought them for a gift and she loves them.
B0002JKPB8|3|You have to either leave these in over night or have one of those blow dryer machines to stick your head in for an hour.  Otherwise the curls will fall out before you can leave the house.  Bummer.
B006KRAWDW|5|Quick shipment and products received were beyond expectations.
B009GIOVKW|5|I love this face-body brush cleanser. It's a great size and the different textured brushes are awesome! I have noticed a huge change in my skin since I started using it.
B006O5OREA|5|My husband loves this.  Says its the best shave he has ever gotten.  Did take him a little while to get use to but loves it.
B00GPE4YIY|5|I love this stuff. Sure, it's fine powder and can be a little messy, but it works better than any other dry shampoo I've ever tried. I have extensions and work out and without this product being used every other day, I would have to wash my hair daily. Lush products rock.
B00432G9OW|5|I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT LINE I HAVE PURCHASED THE AFTER SHAVE AND BALM. THE FRAGRANCE IS VERY CLEAN AND NOT SO OVER POWERING AS THE STUFF YOUNG KIDS ARE WEARING.
B001CIC7E6|5|Great smelling after shave!
B005Z4SW3I|5|If you suffer with dandruff its the best for your hair with the mint awesome and the smell is great.<br />Cheaper in amazon at the salon the big bottle is expensive.
B00068F15K|5|Gracias
B002C8ZX9Q|3|fragrance it self is just great but the shipping took about 10 days (including weekend and business days).
B00GROH9TI|5|I had results the first time I used this peel.  My face was soft.  Toned.  Firm and tight, but not too tight.  Such an amazing product!
B000P276WS|5|WASN'T SURE WHAT TO EXPECT BUT HAVE BOOTS FROM C. SANTANA AND DECEIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE. WAS FOR HUSBAND BIRTHDAY AND HE LOVES IT, I ALSO!
B00C2BHZD0|4|All three daughters found these brushes to be what they were looking for.
B00ELN94GS|5|I loved this product. It makes my skin soft and supple. I really appreciate the Dr Song's customer service.
B00027C8K6|4|I love Clinique. I've been wearing Happy, for the past year, and wanted to try Happy Heart. I love the scent, but, I think i prefer Happy. However, this is beautiful, and may be a little lighter. Happy is such a unique smelling cologne, that it's hard to compare the two.. This has more floral notes, where Happy is a little spicy and a touch of citrus. I get more compliments with the Happy, but, if you like light floral scents, this may be the perfume you prefer.  I alternate between the two now.
B00176F2BS|3|The perfect curling iron.  Love the weight of it and how it curls my hair.  I have fine hair but lots of it and it works perfectly for me.  I've tried others and nothing compares.<br /><br />Updated Review: I'm not sure what happened with the new models but the spring in this is crap.  I haven't had the curling iron but for a few months and the spring is messed up and scratching through the metal making it have issues closing properly when curling my hair.  The curling iron is of no use if it isn't going to work properly and they can't come up with a better spring situation.  Seems like a dumb problem to have that could easily be fixed.
B006L1DNWY|5|Still haven't even used all the brushes yet, but they are very nice quality and the ones I've used so far work wonderfully!
B002SJ5X4E|5|I LOVE this straightener! I was a little afraid of buying it because it was not a Remington, which has been my go to device for my hair. However, my Remington blew out and I am serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Tanzania. I did not have a lot of money to spend and this straightener was available for a reasonable price, with the added advantage that it has dual voltage. When it arrived in country, I washed my hair and used it right away. I love what it does for my hair; and it works for all types of hair(I am African American). You won't regret this purchase.
B00AB4ZTEW|5|These have some great colors that are really pigmented.  They last all day. I usually only wear ELF eye shadow now
B000E7YJNI|5|This is one of my all time favorites. Just a very nice masculine smell that will turn ladies heads. It's not overbearing and it doesn't arrive before you do if you get my meaning here. Women of all nationalities seem to like this fragrance. I didn't realize until today that it has been around since 1972. Good price here too I might add and I know I am going to have to get me a bottle or two.
B00H4IHUL8|2|Product broke when I took the ball off
B00FEES1OO|2|Very cheap material. You get what you pay for. Doesn't look a lot like the picture either. I wish I could have seen it ahead of time. I guess that's why buying online isn't always the best thing.
B006X1H2P6|5|Shipped fast,seem high quality and sharp, can set so they spring back open , or stay closed after cutting
B00LFP4GP4|1|Please do not order this hair it sheds so much it feels like it has plastic fibers in it it tangles and it haven't even been a week trust me your going to regret it
B000O5UWTA|4|Great fragrance and my it seems to condition hair, so while wet, it feels fairly soft.  Fragrance is lovely.  Seems to do its job, keeping yellowing away, although I only use &#34;blue&#34; shampoo once a week or so.
B003JT8PKQ|4|Ive been using Lubriderm for the last two years, very pleased.
B001R50JO4|3|Reading reviews of another product, someone said she preferred this product - I find I prefer the other product.  But it is fine.
B003DVWF5G|5|Love this soap.
B000IF3D38|4|My old hairdryer bit the dust, and after reading a few reviews, I decided to go with this hairdryer. It's lightweight, which is great since I have long, thick hair and it takes a while to dry. I've only used the brush attachment, and I found I didn't need to use my straightener. As for the flyaways and frizzy hair - I do have flyaways and I've become so accustomed to them that I haven't really noticed whether the dryer has made a difference. When I used the brush attachment I noticed my hair wasn't as frizzy, but sometimes nothing can help on those humid days.. Overall, I'd recommend this hairdryer.
B0002UHWTA|3|Did you know this is just water!?, ok, granted, mineral water, but just the same thing you'll find in a regular bottle of evian. Even though, the effect seems to be more of a placebo than anything else. People who go for brand impact will find this to be a great product.
B001A4B3MY|1|THIS COMPANY IS PATHETIC!! THEY THREATENED ME WITH A CIVIL LAWSUIT FOR SELLING ONE BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO AND ONE BOTTLE OF CONDITIONER THAT I PURCHASED  ON EBAY! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I PURCHASED THE PRODUCTS WITH MY OWN MONEY AND I CAN DO WHAT I PLEASE WITH THEM THEREAFTER. THE PRODUCTS DID NOT WORK FOR MY HAIR SO I SHOULD JUST BE STUCK WITH THEM OR LOOSE $20 IN SHIPPING CHARGES TO SEND THEM BACK? ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS AND I AM LETTING EVERYONE AND ANYONE IN THE INDUSTRY, FRIENDS AND FAMILY ABOUT THIS COMPANY. HOW DARE THEY!!
B005G9E98O|1|I bought this eyeliner last year, and never got it. I also ordered the brown one and did receive it, but the white never came. It's unfortunate because these are really great eyeliners, and I'm disappointed overall. I highly recommend the product, but maybe not this seller
B00L0R5494|5|can in perfect condition and im happy with my item I purchased
B0012J30PU|4|I love the way it makes my skin feel...first it turns warm, then refreshing.,,i will definately buy this product again
B00PV15BPW|5|Good quality!
B005RFF5YO|4|My wife love its
B001TVF8HY|1|I ordered two L'Oreal HiP Kohl Liners - Black and they were both completely dried out. No stars for this.
B003BDA09E|5|I have extremely long, thick hair and cannot use a normal size battery.  This one is great!  All my hair fits nicely without getting hooked or tangled in the closure & it doesn't slip out of place.<br /><br />Great price, fast delivery - I'm going to be looking to get some in a variety of colors.
B0049LUI9O|3|Although it says like you can clean it, I have been unable to figure out how.
B0046BHZSO|5|Have paid much more for Teeth Whitening Products. For the price and the amount that you receive this product works great.<br />I have bought several times and will continue to buy. Be careful when putting the Teeth Molds in Hot Water to fit. It does not take much to start making them soft to fit. Learned this the hard way.
B00M6B6YWE|4|I really have not used it long enough, so far so good.  It doesn't stink like the one I threw out.
B00JF5E3IQ|5|My daughter LOVES IT!!!
B00EJTCL5A|5|Super quick arrival and great product! Would definitely do business again
B00C1WH8H8|3|It is comfortable enough, I suppose. I really wanted something that I could really relax on. And it falls off the tub when not in use which is a little annoying. It is not a bad bath pillow, but it isn't really good either.
B001ET78CE|5|Finding good quality natural products at a budget price is always a challenge.  Then finding ones that do the job is even harder.  This spray works.  It holds my hair exactly where I sprayed it, yet a simple brush-through removes it.
B007SY7KPY|1|Bought for lash extensions way too harsh, they hurt the client when taking off, I would not recommend this product
B00147FGJ8|4|I like this lotion and the cost is great! I bought the 100x paint it black also and like that one better because I feel like the bronzer is better . If I didn't have the 100 x to compare it to I would like the 50x just fine. I do switch between the two and am satisfied with my purchase. Also they came only two days after ordering so that was a plus!
B0038B14HQ|5|good for beach
B00014HDT6|5|I have used a few different natural hair dyes... what they really should be called is \\"more natural\\" than chemical-heavy commercial dyes. Unfortunately, unless you use henna, any hair dye you use will have the chemical PPD in it. Supposedly it is the ingredient usually responsible for allergic reactions. Natural dyes have it in a lower concentration. If you've ever had a reaction to a \\"regular\\" hair dye, like myself, where your scalp itches and feels like it's falling off and your ears swell to twice their usual size, you'll find yourself paying attention to labels.<br />Hopefully, you will also find yourself using this brand because it is AWESOME. I cannot speak to grays, as many of the other reviewers have, but I used 4N (chestnut), a very rich dark brown, and am pleased with the coverage. No heavy smell, no irritation on my scalp (which I get with almost ALL dyes I've used), and plenty of product to use with my long hair. Agree with others--get a brush from a store, or a bottle to apply. The gloves are terrible and too big, stop at home depot and get a cheap box of disposables.<br />One other thing--this mix is a little bit drippy and I did accidentally get some on the tiled floor in the bathroom. I didn't notice it until the processing time was up and I came back in the room. I thought that I would have ruined a piece of tile and interesting enough it just wiped away, didn't penetrate at all. I think it says something to the chemical composition of this product. It won't tear through tile, or your scalp.
B001H2FDP2|5|Just paint it on once a day and your polish will last a week, and your nails wont chip.  Period.  Truly amazing!
B0038TYTI4|5|Great product! Better price at Target.
B00GMZUS2M|3|I give this a 3, because it was a 1 & a 5. When my son was smaller it worked wonders with every little breakout. His eczema is horrible now. His skin stayed clear up until about 15 months. The doctor recommended mixing it with the hydrocortisone cream and applying it to the spots. It does absolutely nothing. Skin still looks the same. Which is horrible, some spots I could even say got worse. But everyone's skin is different. I guess I'm just saying it's good for the younger babies.
B001BAH8XU|5|Thank you for bringing a little of Santa Fe to me. Also this always arrives relatively fast.
B00BHZPED0|5|Excellent !!!!
B00175XI5Q|1|I'm removing my original review because after investigating lead content in lipsticks, I would not recommend this product.  Since it is a discontinued color, I cannot find it in any chart showing lead content; however, I did find another \\"Cover Girl Continuous Color\\" on a chart and I find that disturbing enough to discontinue using it.  There are other safer, probably more expensive products out there that do not contain lead, but cost shouldn't be a factor when possible brain damage or cancer are a concern.
B00I1HAQDK|5|I was given the opportunity to test Speed Stick Gear deodorant through Influenster, and I was definitely impressed. The big advertisement here is that it lasts 48 hours, so I decided to just bite the bullet and see if it holds up to the promise. I wore it for two days without deodorizing in between. You can feel when you apply it how it's definitely a lot thicker and heavier than a typical deodorant of this type. I took a shower after 48 hours and I could still feel it on there after getting out. By the end of the 48 hour period I'm happy to say that I it was still actively working. The con is that you really do feel it on you...even after a full day. It's not the most comfortable choice, but I gave it five stars because I believe this is a heavy duty deodorant which does what it says it does, and if that's what you're looking for, there aren't a whole lot of good choices out there.
B00292IQR6|4|only reason I rated a 3 ids because I didnt enjoy the scent like I thought I would.shipment came fast and smells ok would recommend if you like the scent  of honey and milk I just wanted to test it out and it smells ok to me but wouldnt buy scent  again. good size and was packaged great
B000H3TDDA|5|I would be glad to recommend this product to others. It has increased my energy. Have a nice day. Thank you.
B007P57ZY2|4|Poor packaging.  The pump is defective.
B002LYZ1MU|5|I got a sample of this from a friend and liked it. I have a permanent and wanted something a little stronger than regular conditioners. This product really works and is easy to use.
B00LXGFHEE|4|I use 5 out of 6 of these blends--the cold & flu doesn't smell good to me.  A very nice selection and I use a different one every day, depending on my morning mood.  Very nice.
B00G99TEJO|5|These are so cute I was hoping I didn't end up with a box with the same color about 4 times and I didn't. I love these. These will last me a long time.
B005OFAARY|5|I love the blender brush! The bristles are so soft and out spreads the color so evenly. The shader brush was a bonus. Great value!
B007CZE4R6|4|I received a free sample to try from Bzzagent.com.  I tried it and was impressed that it took very little to cover my underarm area and dried almost instantly. It controlled my wetness and odor better than my regular brand.  BUT, the real test was my husband. He's a hardworking guy than can really sweat. He put his regular deodorant under one arm and the Secret Outlast under the other. He felt strange about a &#34;woman's&#34; deodorant, but since it was unscented, he didn't mind so much. He went to work and at the end of the day, we did the &#34;Sniff&#34; test. I didn't know which arm was which, but one clearly smelled much better than the other. It turned out - yep, that was the underarm with the Secret!
B0013NB7DW|5|Seems to work great. Helps get a closer and smoother shave. Dries immediately, better than waiting for a gel to dry.
B00P5FESJO|5|Love it!!
B00E2FAR8E|5|...and safe for the animals. Made my facial skin smooth and soft. Pricey, but hey, it's your face!!<br /> Will buy again!
B00EJD4KF0|5|learned i've had eczema for decades and didn't have to put up with it.  dr. suggested this and it is amazing.  my arms are almost as smooth as my grandbabies'.
B00I07Y9IE|5|Just switched over from Dove and other &#34;lady&#34; deodorants. I absolutely love arm and hammer. It's natural, but gets the job done better than any other deodorant I've used so far. Will be using this from now on.
B003JM4OCG|5|I have been wearing Max Faxtor Panstick Foundation in True Beige for YEARS...I will not wear anything else, the product is that good!
B00RQIFOI2|5|These are great. Especially for the price.I ordered them because of the reviews I read.So i thought I'd add another positive review. I'm a hairstylist and I'm surprised by the quality. These are great and I will order again.
B00565D6XW|2|I'm a long time &#34;scrapper&#34;, and i have fragile weak nails, so when I found this product I was excited, unfortunatly the only part of my body that it actually seems to work on is my feet. for the rest of my body my nails still work best.
B00DBNDU6O|3|I bought this to fit in all the little stamping nail plates.  It is what it is.<br />Definitely not high quality but it gets the job done corralling the plates.
B003D1YSCE|5|Love the smell and feel the men love it too
B000NG808A|5|Everything was perfect and the color was exactly as stated. The bottle was brand new and the packaged arrived quickly.
B00I32AN4K|4|I love the way it makes my hair look & feel. I have thick, long, silky hair naturally...all i wanted was nourishing. this does just that. Hoping it would repair split ends.Why only 4 stars? Well am starting to think this is making me flaky...all my life Ive never had dandruff...for the first time..after about 4 uses of the mask...am seeing flakes on my scalp. Is it taking away from my scalp, the good its doing to my hair?! Not quiet sure!
B003S516XO|5|i have to say it - i'm impressed. all of my previous hair straighteners have cost at least a hundred dollars or more and so i really wasn't expecting much from this thing. when traveling, i experienced a short in the electrical socket where i was staying while straighteng my hair with my old straightener and it fried it (as well as my hair!) i bought this as a cheap replacement until i purchased a higher quality (or should i say, more expensive) product...i figured that even though the reviews are fantastic...at this price it can't really be that special. i was wrong. this straghter heats up quickly (in seconds!), and i am able to effectively straighten my long, thick, wavy hair in less than ten minutes (as little as five if i'm really in a rush) i absolutely love this straighter and no longer have plans to buy a facy expensive one, as i feel this one works better than any other that i've tried before. highly recommend.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/13 - Still raving about this hair straightener. A few months ago my daughter had received a chi as a gift and I tried it out a couple of times to compare as I've never owned a chi...and totally hated it compared to this one. It still heats up within seconds and takes hardly any time to straightem my hair at all. Love. Love. Love.
B00MWLS8XG|4|Pleased with purchase.
B00EQ504JC|4|Very please with the product. Wished it had a larger bottle!
B00498HG0G|3|I've always used Dial for men but I decided to try this out for a change. It smells nice, but I can hardly smell it out of the bottle or while it's lathering. Though it's scent is a tad bit stronger after I've dried, but that still equates to a very faint, even rare scent. The bottle is nice and the sides are textured to help with gripping. This Fiji body wash is nothing special; it does it's job and doesn't leave my skin feeling dry or irritated, but it's not noticeably better than any other bodywashes in those departments. I'd give this a 4/5, but it's weak scent knocks it down a rating. I'll gladly use it until the bottle's empty, but I probably won't be coming back to this.
B001E6O8WU|5|Got everything as described and quickly.
B00158NEUE|5|This is one of the few products that has cleared my skin and kept it clear. I know they say it takes a few weeks to see a difference, but the first time that I used it my face felt so much cleaner and within 2 days there was an obvious difference. I will never try anything else!
B0064VFXV0|2|I am very disappointed with this wig. First off, the quality is no where near as nice as it looks in the picture. It's itchy, feels like fake hair, and is not very real looking. Parts of the wig are also puffy and stick out, making my head look larger than it is.<br />I would not suggest this wig to people with big heads. I can barely squeeze into this thing, and I have a small head! The wig is also a little shorter than pictured.<br /><br />Overall, I am not happy with it. I can deal with the short hair and small size of the cap, however, just the fact that the wig is so obviously FAKE looking makes me not want to wear it. The wig in the picture looks so natural, but the wig I received in the mail does not look like the one pictured, nor is natural looking.<br />I don't know why the reviews on this wig are so good. Maybe I just got a bad one, or maybe the seller I bought it from is bad. I don't know, but I never plan on buying from this seller ever again.
B003FSGRW4|5|I'm half italian and half asian so I've never really burnt out in the sun.  I used this as an excuse not to wear sunscreen as a teenager.  I'm now 22 and wish I protected my skin.  I have sun spots on my face that I don't want forever.  I've been using this product for about three weeks and I can definitely see them fading.  I mostly apply the mosturizer twice a day, as it instructs, but sometimes miss a day or two or sometimes forget to put it on at night.  But it still works!  definitely a great product.
B003UH4UMO|4|This is a great product and it works ....My wife thinks it's the best thing in the world other than me &#34;B&#34; ....
B00XM9S04Y|5|So this device just happens to be amazing! I actually have a blood pressure issues and take a medication that makes me sweat and I have to constantly wipe my face, which dries it out and makes it aggravated. This little gadget has been a god send. I actually took this in my purse with me to our local county fair. I am so glad I did. My face was literally melting off. I got this out and misted my face and it cooled me off and properly hydrated my skin. It was so refreshing!<br /><br />This is super easy to use. You take off the back cover, and use the provided syringe dropper to fill the tank. You can use water, or a blend of water and moisturizer. Once full push in the stopper and close the back. To use, u simply slide down the front cover. The must goes for 60 seconds the automatically shuts off. So effortless!<br /><br />Of course my little one thought it was fabulous and definitely enjoyed the nice cool refreshing mist as well. It's sleek and small, fits perfectly in my purse. And it's pink! Perfection! *sample provided to review
B007MXK11Q|5|Vibration isn't too strong and helps to keep the blades clean and definitely makes for a very close shave. Great.
B0069SQEK2|5|use this essential oil when teaching yoga...relieves tension...also use it personally to relieve headaches...place 2 - 3 drops on palm...rub palms together, 3 inhales, take palms to the back of the neck, forehead and temples (avoiding getting too close to the eyes...as it will make the eyes water)...great alternative to meds
B008ZHHYGI|5|Right now I'm only a little over a week in with this product and I'm already seeing results.  I had a little bit of peeling that only lasted a few days and am noticing improved texture and all-over tone.  I'm only using it once a day in the evening before I apply my moisturizer.  It's also helping with a bit of markings leftover from acne.  This product will not leave any residue and feels light while applying, soaking in quickly.  I can't wait to see what this product can do over a longer period of time!
B00B7LTK52|5|I have lived in Hawaii in the sun for more than half my life. This has led to wrinkles and sun spots on my face and chest. So when I was offered this Anti-Aging Skin Whitening Glutathione Cream from Omiera Labs for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one. Thes Epidermal Hyaluronic Filler is a whitening system that is supposed to even out skin tone and reduse the appearance of lines. Well that is what is starting to happen. My dark spots are definitely fading and my chest wrinkles are also less apparent. I also love the refreshing scent. Great Filler Cream and worth the try.
B004DLPP2U|2|lets say im a novice on my best day i never tryed this fake skin stuff before i jumped right in and started on my buds back i thought i could do this on my free time to practice my mad skills but this stuff fills nothig like skin you cant wipe it clean with wet paper towel the ink stains the rubber and doesnt sink like it does with real skin ive heard of tattooing bananas and oranges for pratice and hog skin so ill stick to those not this rubber stuff maybe the more expensive practice skin is diff but this stuff smells and fills like a white bicycle intertube i wasnt impressed
B003VGMLSO|5|love these colors!
B0050O3260|5|I love this spray.  It takes out the burn from the sun right away.
B00T0UBVX6|5|I really love this oil. I use it to blend with my essential oils.
B008DKYM8K|5|I love the fragrance free liquid hand soap from Simplehuman.  Their scented varieties are nice, but I'm generally not a fan of any scented hand soap.  I wash my hands often enough that I'd get bored or annoyed by the smells eventually.<br /><br />This soap is gentle on the skin and has no lingering smell.  It's a nice consistency too, similar to Softsoap but a little less thick.  It's smooth and lathers lightly.<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed the Container Store stopped selling this variety, but I'm glad I found it on Amazon.  Here's hoping they don't discontinue it.
B00ON1GWMM|5|I have used Covergirl mascara several times before and I love their products, but the new Covergirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara is by far my favorite. I received it for free from Influenster to try for free and I love using it. It is very easy to use and it always looks great when you put it on. The mascara is just as it is described. When you put it on your lashes are soft and have volume without all the flaking and smudging that you normally get from other mascaras. I believe this is one of the best mascaras that they have and I love how is is cheap and affordable but still a great product. I would recommend this to anybody who wants their lashes to look good everyday.
B00NW5N1EM|4|looks cute!
B00C8GBZAS|3|The brushes feel nice but a little too soft for exfoliation purposes.
B00AEUHWP2|4|Love it☺
B00SRQ6EA4|5|Was recommended by my stylist. Met my expectations. Great for edges or short hair.
B00OI4ANG0|5|I recently had a baby, and as anyone in the same position can attest, your once luscious pregnancy hair begins to thin and become dull once you lose all those wonderful hormones. About a month ago I became fed up with my thinning and lifeless hair and bought a month's supply of Infinite Growth, skeptical that I would see any real results but figuring I had nothing to lose. Now, just four weeks later, my hair is noticeably shine ear, fuller, and has more body and life. I started getting those there's something different about you comments, and even my husband has noticed that my hair has regained some of its former luster. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to give their hair a boost, especially new moms who know exactly what it's like to want to feel better about the way you look.
B00PV28AKY|5|Good
B00X3IGHK8|5|This serum feels nice to the skin, definitely moisturizes, and doesn't leave an oil film on the surface like a lot of serums do. Also, there is little to no aroma, which is nice when you don't want clashing fragrances. Would definitely give this to a friend as a gift. The order was problem-free, and I had no issue with delivery or the package. A great product to have alongside your lotions and creams.
B005UKT9LG|5|good
B008M4G52S|5|Exactly what I expected and it was a better deal than Sephora
B00PV15BPW|3|Not as strong as other brands.
B00DPE9EQO|3|The 20% serum is too potent for my sensitive skin.
B00F1F3CJU|5|Ordered it on the 6th, shipped next day, and it arrived here today on the 23rd, when the estimate was october 31-Nov 19th so I was pretty happy about that!<br /><br />I was a little nervous ordering this wig when there wasn't any reviews, but I just fell in love -- the fibers look so soft, thin and overall 'fluffy, and the color was perfect for I wanted; Deidaras hair is pure yellow but I didnt think such a bright color would translate over well into the real world and look good on me, and this shade seemed the perfect balance.<br /><br />This was the first Item I've dared to buy that had no reviews and I dont regret it one bit! The color, thickness of the fiber and everything is accurately represented here, so no worries! In fact I think mine looks a lot better in person-- The poof of the ponytail is perfect! And I wore the wig for quite some time today out of joy, and it wasnt itchy or uncomfortable to wear in the slightest. The only problem I encountered was the fiber tangles easy, though its really unavoidable for a long wig like this--You have to baby the wig a little bit, bit I think its well worth it.<br />In case you couldn't tell I'm extremely happy with the wig, and the overall shopping experience was satisfying so I'd absolutely but from this seller again.<br /><br />Lighting in my added photo is lousy but thats how it looks in indoor lightling. Its a bit more yellow in natural lighting.
B00J2APSWE|5|Great stuff! Stays on without any oily residue. Blends in easily and lasts all day. This Ready, Set, Gorgeous is my top choice for foundation.
B000Z605J0|5|Reverse Lip Liner worked A+. I am 65+ and have fine lines above the upper lip and also lower lip. I have avoided wearing lipsticks<br />(reds, pinks, lip glosses) because when applied they would bleed into my fine lines. If I would try to correct the problem by wiping with<br />a tissue it would only smear the lip color more!. As soon as I received the duwop lip liner I tried it and it works!!! Applied to the outside<br />of the upper lip and lower lip, applied your lip color- no more lip bleed. Now I can wear the colors that I have avoided for so long!!<br />No more clown lips!!
B009DU4QYE|5|Great
B00ARWNVG6|2|I guess for the price is okay. Look like little girl jewerly plus is pink stone. If I knew was pink will never get it crystal white color is the one I want
B00MUOOHSK|4|Good price
B002IT6GWW|5|I love this refill package! I already have the softymo white cleansing oil bottle and buying the refill package is convenient and less expensive here on amazon. I will say it shipping took awhile
B0006M557K|5|Always a little skeptical on Age Spot Formula's but I read good reviews on eb5 so gave it a try.  Was hoping for the best but expecting very little.  Well, I must admit:  this is a good product.  For those who said it didn't work.  I'm wondering if you wanted miracle results overnight?  How long did it take before you noticed the age spots?  Years probably.  Those age spots won't go away in a day or two!  Simply follow the instructions and in about two or three weeks, you'll see results.  I'm very pleased.  Won't do cartwheels down the hall but I've had three people say my skin looks great in the past week and one was a professional makeup artist.  This stuff works but be patient plus stay the course.
B004INQ65S|3|The product is fine. It arrived as ordered. I am just not good at using it. I guess I need another hand.
B00CYA5E1O|5|good
B003QAPTAW|5|all came at the appointed time and undamaged recommend<br />everything was as I saw on page are respopnsable and fast deliveries
B001AROXYG|5|I have an skin irritation and sensitity that hasn't been diagnosed after many visits to 4 different dermatologists.  I've found products that help it through trial and error, and this line of products by exederm has been such a god-send.  I have several exederm products and love all of them.  This particular moisturizer I use on the effective area after I shower.  It sinks in well, leaving my skin both soft and non-irritated.  My constant rash has calmed down since using it daily, and when I don't use it my skin I can easily tell.
B000FRWNL2|3|I'm not sure I can blame this tool 100% or if it's partially my hair but it just takes to darn long to get the look you'd expect from this waver. I'm just generally unimpressed by how it crimps the hair and how long it takes. I have very naturally straight, medium length hair and this tool takes about 20-30 minutes to do my whole head. I've tried both hair moussed/unmoussed and washed/unwashed and I'm not impressed with the results especially when the 90% of the body/wave is lost within the first hour of my hair being crimped. Maybe it's my hair, maybe its the tool. Maybe I'll just not use it and let it collect dust in my closet.
B005PUZZR8|1|I'm so much disappointed in this product. I used to own a Phillips Norelco which I just loved. This Remington trimmer is just not what I want. It makes my beard look so ugly as many hair stick out after a trim. with the Norelco every trim was so fine and polished. I cant buy that again as Philips discontinued that trimmer.<br />I have ended up with a comb and shears :(<br /><br />I don't care about battery life so much as its not a very important feat in a trimmer which you will mostly use in you bathroom where you have the ability to keep it charged most of the time.
B0060NKL2S|5|I love this soap.  It has cleared up my acne on my face without drying it out.  Lather is good and the smell reminds me of the ocean.  Arrived quickly.  Will be ordering again.
B002CL4IDU|5|I really like this product!
B000XPB60U|3|This stuff was ok. Not sure if I would buy again. But it's not horrible
B00GP2N66W|3|Just started using it...I'll try it for a few weeks and then review it here.
B001WAKPOI|5|There are so many hand/body creams on the market, but this one truly works well to alleviate dry skin.  Not available in the U.S. so I was happy to find it on amazon.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.  Our whole family uses it.
B004EG27JS|4|I am african-american with relaxed hair.  I heard a lot about these products so this was a nice way to try them out.  My favorite was the oil and the repair masque and would definitely purchase a larger size of those, but they're pricey.  Because of the price of the full size products I kind of consider these &#34;treat&#34; products instead of for every day use, although I did use the oil every day because I loved the smell. The rinse was good too, but I prefer the Awapuhi Rinse from PM.  I didn't feel like the shampoo was moisturizing enough so I wouldn't purchase that again.
B00548RG8M|5|this is great stuff!  works well on surgical scars.
B005ET4M7E|5|Great color and look. But even though I like it.  I think the price is getting too high for it
B001U9M2EW|5|This product is excellent for making your hair soft and controlled if you have frizzy hair. Wish I could find a bigger bottle!
B004YWS430|5|The lines are softening and my face has a nice glow.  I use it at night so it works while I sleep.  Thank you
B008PMYTD4|5|Being someone with extremely sensitive skin, I have tried all of the brands and types. This is the only stuff I can use to shave and not break out. I highly recommend it for anyone who has skin issues.
B00H03G6F8|4|Product got here faster than expected! I loved that! Also this product isn't exactly odorless, but it sure doesn't smell as horrible as the usual one...yuck. Great!
B0062GZB9G|5|I'm in love with this!!! Easy to put and the eye lashes look fuller and longer! And stayed all day like that!! They don't go down I swear!! I bought this because i went to Disneyland last Sunday and I was worried about the waterproof but the mascara stay all day long even though I get really wet and I pespire all the time :)<br />It's not hard to take it off just use some eye make up remover. Trust me you won't have a problem and you will love this mascara too :)
B004DIXYUI|1|looks like white chalk on me and I have light complexion
B0047ETODO|5|Works on my long dry, color treated curly hair. And no sulfates. We have enough toxins put in our bodies, don't need more!
B002V04OKO|1|Horrible quality ,splitting ans crackling inside the lens.
B000C1W6YA|5|I really like this scent and so does my wife. i have even had the PYT's compliment me on it, and it really lasts!
B004JKB4B6|1|So its been almost 2 years with my natural journey and this is the first set of shampoo and conditioner that has made my hair feel really dry and brittle. I dont even care about the argument of it being sulfate free. The shampoo should make my hairs soft and moisturized when i get out the shower but it doesnt and for that i call bull and is writting this review to save anyone else with $55 thinking that maybe her hair will be different. If you have really good hair maybe you can handle that damage done.
B00181XMGO|5|I had initially bought this at a local walmart and fell in love with it. What conviced my to pay $6 for it over $4 or less for other brand was the smell.  I love the smell and it's always nice when you get compliments on how good your hair smells.<br /><br />Another reason why I really like it is because the name smooth operator really gives it justice. It does not leave your hair super stiff like all other hairsprays but holds it well if you wear it up or curl it.  It does not leave the white residue once you start messing with your hair throughout the day. I've tried many other hairsprays and just can't be convinced to buy any other.  Unfortunately they don't carry it at walmart anymore, but I can always find it on amazon;)
B008XCDXVK|5|Very GOOD.  HAPPY WITH PURCHASE
B003RJ165Y|5|I love this stuff - My skin is glowing!
B002KAO7RA|4|This is the best tasting dry mouth gum. I'd give it 5 stars, were it not for the fact that it also contains malitol, artificial coloring etc etc. But the flavor lasts a long time and it actually works to relieve dry mouth.
B00DIYGGG2|5|This is the best lotion ...still..!! Healed my broken skin. Just use after every shower to heal feet/hands etc.
B000NW8A66|5|Leaves your hands feeling soft, but not greasy.  I even like the soft, subtle scent of this particular lotion.  Excellent price as well.
B007M81B4M|5|Great product that works. Maybe not like magic but with time it does remove fine lines. Good service.
B00027DMI8|5|Love it!!  Been using for a year now and have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and the softness of the wrinkles, now less noticeable :-)  Fast Ship!!
B00AUFS04I|5|cute colors, goes on well! long lasting enjoyed using it! will purchase again! amazon is making me type more words to leave a comment! that s*** obnoxious! its a good deal for what it is
B007ZR2RIE|5|First this order arrived so fast! Great service!<br /> Now about the product. I love Bessie polishes but I live in a rural area and cant find them.<br />was happy to find on Amazon and at such a great price.<br /> The mirror color polishes are beautiful!<br />One coat gives you a perfect polished nail that has great shine.<br />couldn't be happier.
B000OLE7V8|4|This really is a great product.  I'm 36 have always had acne--not horrible, but I pretty much always have a few.  As I've gotten older I esp. have problems with blackheads on my chin.  Could NOT get rid of them, and everything I tried was too dry on my skin.  This product helps the blackheads and does not leave my skin nasty and flaky.      Also, I have a lot of scars on my chin (not acne ones, regular ones from an accident), and this product doesn't dry them out either which, if you have any scars, you will know is a plus.    BUT...I don't care for the scent much--it smells fake and sicky-sweet.  If they made this in an unscented or fresher scent, I'd give it 5 stars!
B008JGXA40|5|With multiple chemical sensitivities there are few products I can use.  I have used Free & Clear for years and love it.
B004TSF8R4|5|This powder brush was a lot bigger than I thought it would be but it works great, is very fluffy, and has not shed at all.
B001V9LQ0W|3|I have very curly hair and have much success with other aveeno products but i bought this thinking that it would not make my hair feel like straw and condition it. With even the least amount sprayed into my hair it very much felt like straw. I wanted this to replace the other expensive hair product that i loved but since it is pricey decided that i would try this instead since i loved the other aveeno products i have gotten in the past. I would of been better off just stickin with the pricer \\"its a 10\\" nourish treatment than this. This aveeno product did not even define my curls, it just make it look stringy. WIll not buy again.
B00021DVCQ|5|My sister had been trying to get me to use BareMinerals foundation for years before I actually tried it. I am so glad that she did because I absolutely LOVE this product. It is so light. <br /> <br />HINT: If you have a few areas of redness on your face, lightly use a concealer stick first, then apply BareMinerals on top of that.  <br /> <br />HINT: Don't apply too too much because then you will get the cakey look that the other people are talking about. It doesn't take much, LESS IS MORE : )
B00G8SLXQ8|5|Good price, nice kit .love it
B00O2E6BLW|4|-200 Ct. Disposable Facial Cleansing Wipes 2x2-<br /><br />These are good for keeping your eyelids clean, especially if you are prone to irritation or inflammation.<br /><br />I bought these to use as a cost-effective alternative to the pre-moistened eye-lid cleaning scrubs (towelettes). They are good for that use. These come twice folded. They are 2&#34;X 2&#34; and unfold to 4&#34;X 4&#34;. They are a little bit thinner than I like when unfolded all the way, so I only unfold them once (it will remain doubled up), this way they are a good thickness and size--2&#34; X 4&#34; (the prepacked wipes are about 2.5&#34; X 2.5&#34;). You can even just use them as they are if the 2 inch square is good enough for you.<br /><br />I apply a liquid cleaner such as [[ASIN:B000Q8ISXM OCUSOFT LID SCRUB FOAM PLUS Size: 50 ML]] to the wipe and now I have a cleaning pad for a lot less than they sell for. I prefer this way instead of using just my fingers (or even worse, cotton) as the instructions on the cleaning fluid advise.<br /><br />These come in one stack in a plastic bag. I plan to try some of the others (they all mostly look the same) and I will post comparisons when I do.<br /><br />No issues - Would recommend - Would repeat
B00SO1096C|5|Good Product
B006R06ISU|5|I recieved the product yesterday and my 4 year old really liked it. I havent tried it yet but will be doing so as I hate mint, so orange seems pretty good.
B00GMWEAJ2|5|I enjoy these earring.  They are super classy and among my favorites.  I would suggest it to others who want to look good.
B001OOLLVS|5|my theeth aslways had a tinge of yellow in them with stains from tea and coffee i bought these last week in a hope to have a whiter smile it has only been three days and these have worked amazing my theeth look brighter and whiter and more healthier. I cant wait to finish the whole box an achive a more whiter result. i would definately recommend these to anyone looking to have whiter theeth, and of course have patience because they will whiten theeth!
B002XQ1VV6|5|I recently tried Illuminum's White Gardenia Petals (the perfume Kate Middleton wore to her wedding; it is about $243 for 100 ml). I loved it, but just couldn't afford that cost. So I went hunting for the perfect gardenia alternative. I've tried them all, from Dana and Cody's versions to Chanel and Elizabeth Taylor. None of these combined a clean scent with definitive gardenia. Then I found this, and the search is over. This perfume is just as good as the uber expensive British version and the price is a dream. This scent is light, clean, and very feminine. The gardenia is undeniable, but not over-powering like some perfumes. In short, I adore this scent and would gladly pay the designer brand price. . .so I was BLOWN AWAY when I discovered that you can purchase 10 ounces for about $40. That is an incredibly good deal, so I can find no fault at all with this scent. It smells just as good as the very expensive gardenia perfumes at literally a fraction of the cost.
B001CT0AGC|5|very good
B000NJE0PO|3|every once in a while you get a sprayer mechanism that doesn't work but on the whole they're very useful to have around for making your own cleaning formlas
B00V75SXEM|5|Great product...like the way it makes my skin feel!!!!  Received a promo code for a review!!!
B000S92S30|5|I liked the product.  It firmed and hydrated my neck.  I immediately noticed the difference once I ran out it.
B006PM89PU|5|When I first got my eye lash extensions this product was a life saver for keeping them from getting all sideways
B002PQ8BQM|5|Works great. It has a weird feeling on your armpits when it is drying, but it works wonders. I have tried a ton of the clinical strength deodorants, and none of them worked for me. This works wonders!!
B000FEF1V4|5|This is the best trimmer I've ever owned.  I like the close cut this provides for my beard.  Works great and the clipper does a pretty good job of collecting most of the trimmings.  Makes for an easier cleanup.      The battery is much better than the model I used to own.
B001FB5OAO|1|I've only had this for maybe 3 days but so far it works really well. I love the smell of the apricot smells very fresh and like real apricot not fake like other deodorants.  I had to switch for years and years I used dove or sauve or whatever smelt good but the past few months they have me itch so incredibly much I had red bruises from itching.  So after researching what this could be i found that the aluminum is probably what was causing it. So I looked for one without, that is reasonably priced and I found this at Walmart and went for it, so far so good if that changes I'll update my review.  3/28/15 UPDATE. I stopped using this product. It started making me itch really bad and then one armpithas gotten very darkend by using this.same thing is happening to my sister as well and she has only used for 1 month.  I do not recommend this to anyone.
B008U5XRX4|5|This is the only staightener ive found for me.. My daughter whom loved the chi.. Always finds it in her self to get a hold of mine..leaving me to buy another.. I will always come back to this one.. Does great altho the plates float.. You can still get a good curl from this straightener if u want it!!
B0002Z0R9C|5|This Super Looper brush is perfect for both my hair and beard.  It keep it all tangle free and neat as a pin.  Enjoy!
B00D3D01KU|1|did work for me
B000M3VR7K|5|Been using this for years to smooth natural curley hair without weighting in down.
B00DPE9EQO|5|This product was provided to me for consideration and possible review.<br /><br />I am serious about skin care and rely on serums as an integral part of my routine. OZ Naturals Vitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum brightens my skin tone, improves texture and the hyaluronic acid helps to hydrate and lock in moisture from my other products. This is a solid performer at a wallet friendly price. I like this product and I recommend it.<br /><br />If you are looking for high quality skin care and you are on a budget, try OZ Naturals. I keep several of their products in my skin care rotation and wouldn't give them up if you paid me.
B001B3PL5Y|5|EXCELLENT VOLUIMIZING HEAT PROTECTING PRODUCT;  FULL HAIR LT WEIGHT PRODUCT WITHOUT STICKINESS.  WORKS REALLY WELL WITH BLOW DRYIING, HOT ROLLERS,
B007BF7HCG|5|Bought this for my fiancee and we both love it. It has a silky texture, so his skin is smooth as a babies butt. It's not greasy or thick, and a little goes a long way. I need to find something like it for women. The smell is the typical male fragrance, but not too strong. This product is great and I strongly recommend it!
B00GP2N66W|2|Does absolutely nothing. I ordered it specifically because it stated it has caffeine in it which is supposed to reduce puffiness. Did not do anything. No brightening or softness either.
B00B7MJ7BI|5|I hate feeling like I need to put on mascara every time I leave the house so my eyes don’t look so… bland without makeup.  I wanted some sort of enhancer would look natural, yet still give that thicker and darker look. I was nervous at first, but it was so safe to use and sure enough my lashes are becoming thicker on their own! I would highly recommend!
B000I1OYNK|5|Just had to comment after seeing the reviews complaining about the odor.  This is a high quality lanolin, and it smells just like it should.  It does not smell like a zoo or a barnyard, it smells like lanolin.  If you are looking for something without any odor, then you should stick to vegetable or petrochemical products (which won't work a fraction as well for skin, hair, leather, etc.).  Also:  Like all anhydrous lanolin (meaning it has very low water content), this is not a lotion - it is thick and sticky, and a little goes a long way.<br /><br />NOTE:  Check the seller ratings before making an order.  One vendor was dishonest - charging my card and claiming a \\"backorder\\" on the product when I wrote them (that's a big no-no on Amazon!).  The next had the product to me faster than I would have hoped, and was actually the cheapest.  Too bad Amazon can't keep a tighter rein on the bad sellers and highlight the good ones.
B00COGVXNQ|5|good quality has tip adapter- long ship time but its worth it
B003PGKHI6|5|I purchased 2 of the ali wigs, in 2 different color and I just love them I ended up giving 1 to my sister I will definitely be buying another one.
B000PD96I4|2|The Personna Hair Shaper is indeed made in the USA; however there is a vast lack of both quality, and quality control. The Fromm Hair Trimmer is only $4 vs. $9, and it is better designed, has less plastic butttons, does not have to have its metal combe adjusted by the user! Further, the Fromm's combe has a close and a far adjustment ( for waves in hair, etc, ). The metal combe of the Personna has to be bent - not hammered. It simply is a product to be used by your beautician, not by he individual! Cost is not necessarily a guide here!
B000JNQSIQ|5|Great deal, serves it's purpose perfectly
B00375USP2|5|The idea of a night complexion is fantastic and the tan color is not very dark. It's a great stuff to have an imperfection-free skin by night !!!
B00SU0HIR0|5|I've used these types of comedone extracters in the past but never had much luck. I love this set because it has a different type of extracter for all different kinds of blemishes. My son is a teenager and is battling blackheads. I have tried to help him extract them before but this kit has been excellent. I was able to get a discount on this kit in exchange for an honest review. They are all good but I took a picture of one that I think works the best. You can see from the photo they're good quality and this is a really great deal because you get 6 different types of extracters.
B008COP6P0|5|Amazing... great for my curls
B00GWBYAWK|5|I saw these from their Instagram page and I love them! They really do work! It doesn't last as long as I would like but that's expected it's not an actual lip job it will go down after a while. But my lips really were plump and perfect. Highly recommend
B000C231SE|5|Great product. Great delivery.
B004BPVF7W|2|It's ok, has potential to be a great product. However, the one we received had several broken pieces, the compacts with mirror were each broken in half. The lipstick wasn't attached at the base, so it falls out.  I think it's an ok starter set for a little girl, but my daughter was pretty disappointed Christmas morning when she opened it up and half the things inside were broken.  The case is nice and can be used for several different things though.  I'd say the case is all that's really worth it.
B008I2IKMW|5|I love the dual head which I can't seem to find in any of my retail outlets. Plus this is a great price!
B005ZAUBJK|1|This product is ok if you wanted face paint. I thought it was lipstick not face paint. So for me I don't like it.
B00180O7FU|5|Best and gentlest way to curl and smooth your hair.
B00BMH7UBM|4|I bought it for my daughter's prom, since she was going to be wearing a backless dress, this was the perfect bra for it! She danced all night and it stayed put throughout the night.
B0050FJNYE|1|Takes forever to set polish. It fell off the couch onto to the carpet and never worked again.
B002HWS4R0|4|To be clear, this should not be anyone's primary shaver.  It is, however, exactly what I needed for travel.  Now, I don't have to haul along my Panasonic[[ASIN:B0018A32XS Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver, Mauve]] or borrow my husband's shaver, (or worse, resort to blades - I'm prone to terrible razor burn).  The shave is a little slow but it's reasonably close and it's comfortable to hold.  I received the pink and orange argyle.  Cute!  I can't yet speak as to battery life.  It's easy enough, though, to bring a spare pair.
B00BB8ZHIU|5|Very good
B00EKK9Y9O|5|A plus shipped quickly
B00NM5ACLM|4|Took long to receive but its great perfect size for my ear..would buy again
B00M6I5SNI|5|Very good. It work fine
B001GF7WGS|4|I used this polish several times and am pleased with it. It is a nice color and lasts a long time.
B00ON3PG7C|5|Wouldn't be without this eye cream.  It's light and I wear it day and night, wonderful feel.
B0009R15O4|5|Perfect color.
B005YXU3ZA|5|Helpful for people doing Invisalign tooth straightening process.  Helps dry mouth and freshens breath.<br /><br />Will buy again when these are gone.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00174GJC6|5|I started using this soup two weeks ego and I cannot believe the results. My skin is extremely soft and beautiful. I use it on my face and body. I leave it on for about two minutes before the shower and it works great.
B00R0MMBW6|1|Sold as a new item and it came opened. Hope to return
B00005CDSF|4|I purchased this item based on past VS experience (reasonably reliable) and online recs from Amazon customers.  It works well with good volume of air and heat.  It is not heavier than similar size dryers.  I can't tell that the ionic setting does anything different than a regular dryer.  My wife and I have used it for ~ 1 month now without any problems.    Update after 9 months:  One of the air heating mechanisms quit working, so now it only produces \\"low\\" heat.
B001ET77P2|2|Has a strong offensive smell. Reminds me of diesel fuel.
B005KNW0HI|5|I have been using \\"Rapid Lash\\" since 5 weeks. I applied every night before sleep and I already have longer and curlier eyelashes. My eyelashes was never as long as right now in my life, never got curls, even with the eyelash curling tools. Also I didn`t get any color changes on my eyelid with this product. I read many reviews on different related products. Some reviews showed that some products made color changes (such as eyelid becoming darker) on the eyelid. My eyelid color same as when I start using \\"RapidLash\\".<br />Thank you \\"RapidLash\\".
B001IAG7G2|5|Only one word needed, Excellent.
B00J6G92XK|5|Very nice!
B009C9YAR4|5|Gives hair body and shine.
B008O47ILI|5|Excellent thick quality facial pads. These are great for your face and nails. I use them on my face/eyes every morning. I love them they are very good quality organic cotton and these are the best I've used the softest for around the eyes.
B008RYTKB6|1|Do yourself a favor: don't buy this crap. This so-called Dr. Raymond is getting rich by ripping off well-meaning consumers!
B002YFUBVM|5|The flower is beautiful, the packaging is impecable and the clip stays in my hair. This distributor really takes pride and care into their work. I am so satisfied with my purchase and I recommend them to anyone that really wants a great product.
B0000A1WGK|1|This picture is the straightner AI ordered but, not the one I received so I really cant rate this product. The one I recieved came with no box or instructions.
B0012QK3HG|5|This product is great for frizzy hair. It calms it without weighing it down. Used it at the beach for low maintenance style, and it was perfect. gave me that wavy carefree beach look. I purchased my first bottle at a local store, and when I went to buy another bottle it was gone,  I could only find it online. Great price too. Well worth the money.
B00005BJ92|5|I've had issues with my tongue for a long time.  My taste buds and papillae tend to grow longer than normal, allowing bacteria to hide and grow, and causing bad breath.  Normal toothbrushes are inadequate to properly clean my tongue, as they cannot reach as far back as I need.  Regular tongue scrapers also do not seem to do much for me.  So, when I first saw the Tung Brush and Tung Gel here on Amazon, I was a bit skeptical.  But not for long!  After trying this for a few days, I realized this thing works amazingly well.  The brush is the perfect size and shape to reach toward the back of the tongue without gagging.  The gel rinses off the tongue really well - better than normal toothpaste - and cleans well.  After a couple of weeks using the brush and gel, my tongue was looking better than ever, and my breath seemed fresher and cleaner (at least according to my wife and children).  Added to normal tooth brushing and flossing, it will go a long way to improving oral health - that has been my case for sure.  Highly recommended!
B00BA0G6KC|5|Bought this for my 14 year old granddaughter she uses it all the time. Can put her hair up in a few seconds and it looks great
B000HLAGBU|5|Amazing chapstick! I first got this chapstick as a gift and used it quickly. I now buy it as a gift for others, including myself. Works very well and smells wonderful. I love all the earth mama angel baby products, but this is one that I can use on myself, not just my little one.
B00FZ8OZD0|5|Love the size - same great product, better package!<br />Wish it was available on a regular basis instead of a &#34;special offer&#34;!
B00G4EHUXQ|5|I think I found a winner.  It doesn't dry your skin out.  It leaves your skin feeling very clean and fresh.  It's almost softer than when I used to moisturize.  It's fairly new to my skin yet but it does even seem to be doing a better job for me with the blemish aspect than Proactiv did.  I'll keep buying this and keep note of the wrinkles.
B000KEBKKU|5|I sampled and then bought shiseido benefience wrinkle reducing eye cream, and I love it!  It's so great, I've been shopping for a good face cream in the same line.  I know the products are pricey, but all the reviews I've read on Bio Performance Revitalizer and Whitener on this and other sights average in the 4 and 5 stars range, and it didn't cost $100!  Reviews I scanned said it was great for all skin types, wonderful for reducing visable age spots and acne scars, and good for sensitive skin.  I'm still trying this product out, but I'm excited, even if it ends up being a sometimes treatment best used in winter.  The jury is still out on that!  Amazon.com is a great place to find bargain prices on luxury items, especially if you're very careful and know you really want what you're ordering. I'd love to order all the shisiedo products, but for this time, this face cream lasts a long time and is a great investment in self care!  Thanks Amazon!
B005N1IYTU|5|great product my wife loves anything pikachu and i cant wait for her to open this for christmas : )
B00469V5QO|4|My mom uses it for her facial cleansing.  It's mild and soft for her face.  Good product at a reasonal price.
B001LUDH3K|3|If you are traveling for a short period of time, these really can work.  I do not recommend using them straight out of the package.  If you bring a small bottle, take out however many sheets you want to use, put them in the bottle, add some hot water, shake it up, and they'll work just fine.  I traveled for two and a half weeks, and I used these, and had no trouble.  Granted, I was grateful for regular shampoo and conditioner when I returned.
B00IFEH0D8|4|gives hair body. not sure how it will do when heat goes on and air is very dry, but for now is really good
B009P4EAF8|1|I am always using false eyelashes and I thought this would be a great new glue to try. I was wrong. It doesn't stick after waiting for it to become tacky and it's just awful. Please do not buy this. Please save your money. -_-
B001RVMRCA|5|Love it, great value
B00G6JZUMM|5|Perfect mauve color.
B00KXG8JF4|3|I have seen no difference in my face at all.I expected to see smaller or less wrinkles.
B001FB5IRS|5|I'm a girl that if asked what beauty product I'd never leave the house without, my answer wouldn't be mascara or lipstick. It would be moisturizer.<br /><br />For years I stuck with my trusty Nivea. I like moisturizers that are white and odorless. I just feel like they're cleaner. I liked Nivea because it was light but not sticky.<br /><br />I developed a mild case of eczema 2 years ago and couldn't continue using the Nivea and my doctor recommended that I use only Eucerin. I never went back to anything else.<br /><br />It's a thick cream, but with absolutely no stickiness or tackiness that some moisturizers have. It's got a pump, which is much more sanitary than a pot you're constantly sticking your fingers into. And 1 bottle is pretty big and lasts quite a while. I was so glad to find this deal.<br /><br />It arrived quickly and was packaged very well. Good job, seller!<br /><br />Excellent, excellent product,
B002UD52NK|5|best conditioner ever. the smallest amount goes a long way. leaves my hair soft and shiny, and knot free! been using this stuff for years and will continue to do so as long as its available. highly recommend! especially if your hair is colored and dry.
B0001MKV38|5|I have used this product for several years and have not spent one day of it tanning.  This is the perfect daily body moisturizer for all skin types.  LOVE it!  This product also arrived ahead of schedule and was VERY reasonably priced.  Thank you to the perfect seller!
B009VXUJUI|2|Pretty deceiving if you ask me!!!<br /><br />I searched everywhere on the internet for 9W 365nm replacement bulbs for my Shany UV Lamp.  These were the only ones I could find.  Although they snapped into the unit okay, there are about 1/2 to 1 inch shorter than the ones that came with the lamp.  That was a disappointment.  I don't know if it's the bulbs, the product or the CND Shallac Base Coat, but my base coat now wrinkles every time.  I've tried curing it for 10 seconds and 2 minutes - both attempts, the base coat wrinkles.  I didn't have this problem at first.<br /><br />There are tons of UV Lamps out there, but NO REPLACEMENT BULBS!  Very discouraging.
B007Q0WW0S|2|Not all that great I thoughr It was gna work better but nope its the same as baby oil might as well use cocoa butter cream
B00PG28B3A|5|My daughter let me borrow her cream for a week.  Another Radha product I am sold on.  Normally, I cannot use products with Retinol, as they cause redness and over dryness.  This cream is fantastic!! And, in just one week I noticed a difference in my skin tone, texture and a softening in the lines around my mouth.  Gave my daughter her cream back and bought my own!!  Radha, keep up the great work!
B000N2IGPG|4|I love this product.  My hair is fine and curly.  This shampoo leaves my hair shiny and , full of  shine and bounce.  Think wash does not weigh down ny curls or cause frizziness.  Thank you AG for such a wonderful product.
B002DOO1VA|4|A great set. But there is not many small brushes and pointy ones. So for fine details, you need to buy some small pencils too. Soft and nice feeling on the skin, nice handles. Feels great to work with. Easy to clean too.
B007RL6TXM|4|Even though my arms are toned from sports and light weight-lifting, they were still crepey due to age and sun exposure.  I've tried many things, including Tretinoin cream mixed with CeraVe, which my dermatologist suggested, without improvement.  This is the only thing that has helped.  I thought it was expensive at $50 but I've been using it for six weeks and it's not empty yet.  Will most likely re-order.
B005F1ISC6|5|This is some of the best shampoo I have found in a while.  My stylist recommended it and at 30 dollars a bottle at the salon, I passed.  Found it on Amazon for much cheaper.  After about 3 weeks of using it I notice a significant difference in the texture of my hair.  It was breaking a lot from all of the chemicals I had been using, and it finally has stopped!  Definitely recommend.
B005E98NCE|4|Great moisturizer
B0042R5JXA|4|First let me give you guys some past information. For some reason like many who struggle with this condition, several years ago I started to have repugnant body odor. To make a long story short, I tried everything and when I say everything I mean everything. When I came upon this product by chance on the website I was real reluctant to try it until I read a review that it helped with a few peoples' body odor.<br /><br />I ordered a bottle and tried using it. It took about a week before I started noticing any difference. This product reduced my body odor about 60 to 80 percent. I am still looking for something that will reduce my body odor to where it is not longer noticeable. I have purchased a few more bottles since then.
B00BTO2K04|4|I really like this and may continue to buy them when this one wears out.  It is gentle enough and dries nicely.
B004AI9OBY|5|I'm sorry that the first reviewer wasn't happy with this product... but she did mention that using several did work... and that's the trick!  I bought the dark color first, then bought the blond set.  My hair is straight and very long and I suspect that these pins work best with longer hair.  My hair color is silvery blond with very dark under-color at the nape of my neck.  I twist in the dark spirals from the bottom of bun upwards and then twist in two blond spirals from the top downwards.  I angle the spirals to match whatever configuration my loosely twisted bun happens into... I have tried for a long time to get that casual up-do look but this is the first (and only) product that works for me and lets me feel comfortable enough to actually go out with my hair up and not be constantly worrying about it falling down!
B0047PSV14|2|Light switch does not work so good,light does not dire so well.
B00OQ1XWWM|5|These are so beautiful, even shinier than the picture. Durable and timing was amazing. I would definitely recommend. Great product would definitely purchase again
B008FX7B9M|5|Wow. Just wow. Wonderful collection, very pigmented and nicely packaged. If you're reluctant to get this pallet, dont be! Your only regret would be not getting it! I'm in love.
B00QL93YTI|5|This product makes me undeniably happy! I couldn't find the right hair curler for my dull and straight hair. However, the Miraqueen curling iron ended up being the perfect hair tool for me! I was worried at first about purchasing this product because, I have tried everything else! hair crimps, other curling irons but I just couldn't find the right technique for my hair! However, this product was definitely the right choice for my look and I am more than happy that I purchased it. I highly recommend the Miraqueen curling iron! You will not be disappointed, I can guarantee you that!
B00ISBK31O|5|I’m having a blast! All I do is spray it unto my hair and everything is done!
B004WSXD4G|1|This product in no way claims what it states it will do. I saw better results with other cellulite creams that I have used. And there's only enough product to last for a couple weeks. Who wants to keep spending more & more money, only to find out, it still won't do anything? I eat a healthy diet & exercise regularly. I used the product as instructed, but there was no change at all in my cellulite. I will go back to the product I used before because at least it was starting to make a difference.
B000Z97BSU|5|Was all out of psoriasalve and it is the only thing that helps my dry skin in the wintertime. Product arrived exaclty as ordered and quickly at a great price. Will definitely reorder int he future.
B00VKHKH8C|3|dont buy it for skin tags it dont work at all not even on very tiny skin tags i soaked them 3 times a day for 3 weeks and absolutely nothing at all changed and im talking very small skin tags-----P.S. they contacted me and told me they would refund my money and they did very fast because of this i would say there a very good company the product didnt work for what i bought it for but it might for the other stuff they claim it works on its got a guarantee i say go ahead and try it you cant loose.
B005ATHOGY|5|very pleased to find an all natural hair gel. that works for me.since I am so sensitive to chemicals and fragrances
B008CEDY5O|4|works well
B002TW16IW|5|I love this stuff.  I have thick, coarse hair and Aquage really helps make it silky and protects it from the humidity.  Wonderful fragrance too!
B0052BPDKO|5|GREAT product ....
B000EMWFD4|5|These tweezers are well worth the cost.  They are a joy to use.  I have recommended them to friends and plan to give them as gifts.
B004AI97MA|5|very fast shipment. i like it
B004L9395E|1|The smell is dull and the the product drys hair.
B00AKS2208|4|This was a gift
B0015KHMRS|4|This trimmer works great and is sold at the right price. My only problem with it is that I like to keep my beard at 1-2 centimeters in length, and this trimmer doesn't offer any heads to accommodate that.<br /><br />The longest head still cuts my bear down to 1/3&#34; or so. So if you only intend of keeping a short beard or stubble, this is a great trimmer. Otherwise I would look for something else.
B00466D6X2|5|it was just what I needed to the mannequin foam head stand in the display case and hold the cap right
B000UVZU1S|3|It is okay not quite the thing that Dr. OZ was going on about per my friend but okay and like most creams.
B00NNM05HA|4|I don't see a huge difference since starting to use this product but it makes my skin feel great! It really does leave your face feeling clean! Be careful with using step two too much because it is harsh on the skin.
B009W4OABA|5|Just receive my hair great quality better then some store brands and great price for the amount of hair I received. It arrived way sooner than original date! Thanks!!
B003230M46|2|Didn't do much for me.
B00DBA3I6E|5|I bought this a while ago but I loved everything in this makeup set. I couldn't really afford full sized Benefit products at the time & just wanted to test out the products. This was a great way to test out a lot of things & not spend a lot of money. I have used up everything but the lip gloss & highlighter only because I hardly ever use lip gloss & I love the highlighter so much I'm scared I'll run out of it lol!
B0013TE70Q|5|this is the best stuff, for my hair...event my 2 yr old daughters hair I spray it on in the am.  Really the best detangled out there.
B003WR3QSG|5|My husband really enjoys this brush.  It feels nice on his skin and not scratchy.  There is less hairs coming loose than the previous brush he had.  Also, the wooden handle is very easy to hold onto with wet and soapy hands.
B005FJQQMC|5|I have been doing so many cool nail projects with my girls.  Elmo, Gum Balls etc...They are a lot of fun & make things so easy.
B00CA05FS0|5|I use this after I shampoo as a leave in conditioner. When My hair is almost dry I pump a little into my hand and work through my hair. It give lots of volume and shine. Love the smell too.<br />I have thick hair mostly straight with waves underneath. It is color-treated with a slightly coarse texture as well.
B00WOROGWU|5|Great product. Great idea.  I highly recommend buying a bottle or two and give it a try. You won't believe the difference is the way your skin looks and feels.  I hope you enjoy it add much as I have. .
B000WIFUVY|1|This product is garbage. The floss falls apart after the top row of teeth, leaving bits of string stuck in them, and the pick at the end is extremely sharp and stabs your hands. These flossers are covered with gadgets and trinkets that serve no purpose, save making them more difficult to use and expensive to manufacture. Stay away.
B004UQ6Q62|4|feels high quality tool &#62;
B001AO0WCG|5|Great product! Hydrates my hair without making it grease!
B000C214BK|4|Very nice citrus cologne. All you need it two sprays and it last at least 8 to 10 hrs.
B0009DT39W|3|Love it but suck that they don't have build in an automatic power switch off. If u forgot to turned off u can run through batteries pretty quick
B001MA0QY2|5|Purchased 3.  my daughters and I love them
B0083E763E|5|Best stuff on the market!
B00ALMK7QE|5|Pretty good stuff.  Reduced the little lines in my face.  Seems to make my skin more even toned in color.
B00CAY8TMA|5|This smells so good and so rich and creamy on my hands and skin. I need a dozen of them to keep on hand.
B002R7T2D0|5|I absolutely love this perfume, it is one of my favorites! It has a spicy and sweet undertone that works well together. My husband loves it too. It's definitely a head turner ;).
B0002XN3V8|1|Did not work AT ALL. I sent it back.
B00NUW6GHG|5|Great taste. Low calorie and good assortment of flavors.
B004LPZZWS|2|what should I say, I have oily and acne prone skin and I hope this cream can help me fade my acne scares and lighting up my skin ton. Sadly it didn't work out well. The texture is thick and it made me feel sticky and itchy. Hadalabo is a super famous brand in Asia and I really wanna to like it. However none of their products worked for me.
B00HE88SLO|5|This brush works great and was worth the cost.
B00HY0GTQ8|1|Did not like..very disappointed in the size!
B002GZW7XA|1|Wasn't the same as we usually buy at the department stores!!!!!!!! I don't want to think it's fake cause the crap they put in there is gross !! I'll never order thi again online
B00BAM7F8C|4|Lots of options and all very good quality! The front of the package tells you what each mask will do for your skin. Does NOT cause breakouts! Smells good too :)
B00AQEQNPQ|5|Great value
B000FS1W4U|4|This works great, love the color.  It is a bit loud, which to me is fine, because I don't dry my hair at odd hours, but if you need a quiet hair dryer, look elsewhere.  That being said, I love it, dries my long hair fast and that is a must for the below freezing temps we are having this winter.
B005KO7NK6|5|Great size, Great quality so pleased with my purchase arrived fast and well packaged / a great value  and a must for any adult mannequin
B004UWVLJI|5|Best black hands down. Even beats out eternal ink. I will never use another black. Totally blew my mind. Great buy!
B00AY49DR8|2|I see no reason for this product.  I'm a 35 year old male who is starting to see my face get older and I'm not happy about it.  I ordered this toner because it was recommended for use with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure by Cosmedica Skincare...but there is no reason for this to exist, it does nothing.  There's no difference from using it versus not using it.
B001P2X7Z2|5|I purchased this because my nail tech uses it. It does the job and dries my nails quickly---even with a French manicure I don't get any nicks on the tips.
B00009RF1E|2|Fairly disappointed with this machine. Well made but poorly designed. Extremely loud, so that trimming ear hair is painful. The fine teeth often catch on my mustache - more pain. The attachment system is borderline (Wahl's achilles heel), and the caddy is almost worthless. The battery started out very strong, but already shows signs of deterioration.<br /><br />I does serve its intended purpose for very light work. All told I would not buy again.
B000F14WJ4|3|The edidible water based & peach flavored massage oil was okay. Next time I would like to try a different flavor.
B00SSE2L48|5|This product really kills toe nail fungus
B007U7TORG|5|I love this kit!!  I've been doing at home manicures for months now and this is my staple!!  Really works great and polish lasts a long time.  Definitely worth the investment.
B00OCCVZ42|2|This is not a very good wig... The cap shows through if the bangs are moved the wrong way and the bangs are VERY long! They have to be cut and are very messy. The wig also tangles like CRAZY! Good luck detangling it. I could not get it untangled and the more I worked on it the worse it got. It is also very thin and has gaps that look bad. Personally I would not recommend this wig especially for cosplay...
B0091IJ4C2|1|I hate it.  I'm not even sure if this is a GEL top coat because it doesn't behave like one.  It wipes off easily with nail polish remover.  As one reviewer stated, it doesn't come with instructions so I used my UV lamp for the standard 3 minutes.  For me it also lasted a shorter time than just an ordinary top coat.  It chipped the same day I put it on.  I like seche vite a lot so I chose to ignore the negative comments.  It think ordinary seche vite or any ordinary top coat would be better than this stuff.  Don't ignore the negative comments like I did and waste your money.
B00OP21NEQ|3|I tried the new Vidal Sasson Salonist Hair Colour in Medium Brown that I got for free to try and give my honest opinion from Bzzagent. The brown color is nice but it came out a little darker than a medium brown. I do like the process of this product...first you apply to your roots and then 10 mins later you apply the remainder that you mix with a serum to your ends. The only problem was I have long hair so there wasn't enough product to fully cover my ends. This would be more appropriate for short to shoulder length hair. The color lasted about 7 days before my grays started showing so that was a bit disappointing. I give this product a 3 out of 5 because the pro and cons are side by side.#GotItFree#GotADiscount
B004V45UXS|5|This is a great scent & very unique since it's harder to find now......I get tons of compliments when I wear it
B00AFG7DP4|3|Too much sparkly makeup and not enough matte.  However the box is terrific and the makeup in general is fine.
B000V9EDV2|1|I have used BE for several years. I thought BE was a good product because it was \\"natural\\" however it is NOT! It causes BAD BREAKOUTS!! Cystic under the skin hard acne, urrrg! I do not know if they changed the formula but I would stir clear of this!! I had no idea it was breaking me out for the past 6 months until I read about it on a acne forum and sure enough Bare escentuals was on the list! They have some ingredient Bismuth Oxychloride (spelling?) anyway that is what causes breakouts from what in read. Regardless once I stopped using it my sking slow cleared up now I have acne scars I need to remove! Grrrrrrrrrrrrr
B0031WPB8U|4|VERY coarse, but good files.
B0043OYFKU|5|Had a Clarisonic that died after a year (and I didn't really use that much). This works MUCH better and doesn't take up room on the counter while charging...just needs two batteries. Face feels much cleaner after using this one than the Clarisonic.
B004TSCQ9M|5|I find this one is better the illuminair that I had previously. glad I made this purchase.
B00K6DIRW4|4|Great scent.  Only two issues.  1)Price.  2) Fades fast.  You don't have to worry about putting &#34;too much&#34; on.
B0079PAF2M|3|For a week before Christmas the lashes were cute with my Rudolf antlers and nose, but they didn't stick real well, and lashes broke off as we traveled between cities over the holidays. They're probably fine if you stick to city streets.
B000068PBT|5|I am pleased with Norelco razor Heads I received the fit my shaver correctly and they are cheaper than at a local store
B005HJHP3E|5|I started using Control Corrective Hydrant Stabilizer about three years ago and I love it.  I sleep in it instead of moisturizer.  It is just like the label says-like giving your face a big drink of water.
B000C1UFPC|5|Really a great gift for my wife. She loves the smell of perfume. Perfect buy for a perfect occasion.  It is not out of trouble, is to give desired.
B0077T56JC|4|Specifically purchased this to store my Pandora bracelets. Case was much larger than I thought it would be. Holds so much, and is very sturdy. Happy with purchase.
B00GR54KDK|5|I used to order this product directly from Boom Boom before Amazon started selling it. And this does indeed work!<br /><br />When I first started using the product, it took about a month for me to see the full extent of the growth. I'm in the maintenance stage (use it once every other day) and my eyebrows continue to be thick and luscious.<br /><br />A few tips: You will go through the formula quickly in the beginning as your eyebrows are growing in. And you must screw on the cap tightly or it will dry up. And yes, it's expensive, but it becomes less so when you don't have to use it as much.<br /><br />My eyebrows began to thin as I got older, especially on the edges. Brow job filled in the empty spaces and thickened the existing hairs. I don't know how it will work on someone who over-plucked, but for thinning brows it works great!
B00LKSVFI2|4|Works, reflects just what I needed.
B0011DL6R6|4|I love that it doesn't have fragrance and it seems to work in my hair well enough after having used it regularly for a few weeks now.  I air dry my hair so it can sometimes end up frizzy or too flat depending on the day.  This leave in has seemed to help me balance it out a little.
B0000YUXI0|5|Worked for my daughter in 3 days! I was super skeptical but it worked. I would recommend this to anyone. Taste horrible and was totally sake for my 3 year old. I dont think she even ever tasted it. All I had to do was put it on her thumbs, tell her what it was and why we were doing it, and she stopped.
B000C234DQ|5|Quick shipment. Love cologne lastes long!! Great price
B00GK8SOV8|5|Daughter likes.
B00PEJ3HEI|4|I was a little disappointed that the powders were all over the other stuff. I had to clean everything but still happy
B0000C0XL8|5|Used it to make a diluted version of a strong perfume. The diluted version came out really well.  It's a nice moisterizer on the skin as well with no scent.
B001KYTUVA|5|I wore this lipcolour for my Wedding in 2004, it lasted all day so I was very impressed and kept purchasing this product and eventually L'Oreal took it out of production.  Cleaning out my makeup a few months back, I had a small amount left in a tube and tried it and again it lasted all day.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  It was in perfect condition when I received it.
B000F4GLT0|3|The product work well, but I just wish these was more sizes available.  Be careful not to get it on healthy skin because this product doesn't doesn't know the difference between dead or healthy skin.
B00LERQ426|4|ok
B001KYNZIY|5|I have the product to death its great with my oily skin plus it came in great condition will definitely keep buying
B006NPRMU2|4|It's the best wig you'll get for 8 bucks.<br />Soft, manageable synthetic hair with a slight flip out. The bangs come long, so be prepared for some minimal amount of styling-- that could mean just bobby-pinning them to the side.<br /><br />It's not very full, but combined with a large headband or hat? Looks just fine. Try layering or sewing together two of these if you really need volume.<br /><br />Eye-catching color, great price.
B000EVGOS2|5|This stuffs works like magic. I literally saw results after just one use.
B00142ACP6|5|After hearing about the horrible things parabens and phthalates can do, I chose to make the switch to a more organic type of conditioner. It was my first time using an organic hair product and over time I have grown to love it. I have long hair and I've noticed a decrease in the amount of hair that falls out in the shower. My hair is also super shiny and soft since using this product. I also love the smell.
B00Q5LB9K8|3|So far i've used 1-pack contain, as I started to use the 2nd the spring on the 2-pack did not work, i'm hopping that will not be the case with the rest of the pack.
B004DIXWWS|5|too bad it's discontinued
B004BVYT2Y|5|Love it. Make sure to clean and dry area first, I use alcohol.  May take a couple times to get it right. Stays on all day. Very happy with product
B001PAF234|5|If u love the scent of tea tree oil, this is wonderful! I dilute it a bit and put in my dispensers.
B0038LLOV2|3|This one does the job for my daughter hair in ballet class. But two ends that will clasp together is hard to push to close  or pull to open. It is working for the price very good compare to 10$ softer model that you can find in dance supply store in USA.<br />I have bought this item coupe of time from amazon. Not that they break but my doughter loose them more often.
B004ZT0SSG|5|This shatter color looks great over just about any other solid nail color.  I got zoo many compliments when I wore this red over a metallic orange...looked so awesome!!  Long lasting too....my manicure can put in a full work week with no noticeable chipping.  Love it!
B00P2MWSUQ|2|I had high hopes this product would work but it didn't on me.  It left my eyebrows too dark, but might work on other people. The product is great just wasn't satisfied with my color.
B00CFDE6MS|2|It s very mild where aroma does not last long,
B00NY5NGPE|5|This feels great on my skin, toned and tight but not dry!
B002SR7H2M|5|My mother, daughter, and I ALL appreciate this product and use it daily.<br />Three generations can't be wrong, can they?
B000FW2NIU|4|I really haven't seen a difference as of yet, been using it, but I think it will make a difference in the summer
B0042KKHHA|5|excellent product, it really works I can now play sport out in the sun with out the worry of getting sunburnt.
B006Y7U4S6|5|We had lice and put a little neem oil in our regular shampoo. Works wonderfully! Also makes your hair super shiny and strong. Smell = not so good though.
B003M1SSE4|1|I have been using essential oils in my holistic business for years but the University of Essential Oils that I purchased from stopped supplying oils to focus on education. I settled with them after trying a long line of brands for quality at an economical price. Thought I'd try this one that I'd not tried before. I purchased this Rosemary oil along with their Eucalyptus oil. Opened the Rosemary first and was disappointed by the lack of Rosemary aroma and the overwhelming medicinal alcohol smell. I was shocked when I opened the Eucalyptus to discover not only did it smell in no way like Eucalyptus, I could not differentiate it from the Rosemary. When I closed my eyes and smelled from each bottle, they were identically unpleasant--nothing pure in these oils. I'd rather pay more for something else.
B000BH92J2|5|I have tried many leave ins and recently started using Shea Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner because it works wonders on my 2c3a curly hair. It needs the extra moisture and seems to really love Shea butter. After using this leave in, my curls were in beautiful soft clump of curls. You don't have to use a lot to get a lot of the moisture. Smells great too.<br /><br />Thanks Shea Moisture.
B000R8YKCE|5|I love this easy application of nice smelling coconut oil that lasts the entire day and compliments are given as to the nice smelling spray.  I will continue to use and share this product for years to come; so please never discontinue the product or change it!
B000JX6ECG|5|Great for the original Headblade.
B0057Q5CSW|2|Too small, sizing inaccurate
B00JMV9E7S|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Great colors, perfectly pigmented, great for brown/green eyes.
B00MI3OVV6|5|Love this style very cute
B009L11P8U|5|I absolutely love this glitter combo. It reminds me of the circus with it's bright, fun, glitter colors. With the variety of colors in the blend, it goes well over most shades (and looks awesome in a glitter gradient). I didn't have much trouble getting even glitter coverage, meaning I didn't have to dig enthusiastically. I just rolled the bottle in between my palms a few times upside-down, and the glitter dispersed perfectly.<br /><br />It is a bit of a pain to remove, even as a topcoat over another color simply due to the large glitter pieces. I recommend wearing this over a PVA glue basecoat
B000E7WG8I|5|I am from the US and I have been living in Chile for 6 months, I told my Chilean family about amazon and they were amazed when they found out amazon would ship to CHILE! We got the perfumes SO QUICKLY! It was awesome! Strongly recommend this product and the seller. xoxox
B00HLWOHFE|5|Exelente...
9944260290|5|Awesome product. Highly recommend. On my second month of using it and seeing improvements.
B003V32UAQ|1|It was dull and never worked better than the previous one.
B002SFVP2W|2|Let me begin by simply stating that this product did NOTHING to reduce the look of wrinkles on my face.  I've used other products that have cost significantly less and produced much better results.<br /><br />I think the first thing that struck me as strange with this product was the lack of instructions for use.  Basically, the instructions were to use a drop of the product on clean skin - that's it.  No mention as to how often.  I'm still not certain if this product should be used in the morning, at night, or both to achieve the wrinkle reduction benefits.  I might even add that I checked online and there were no additional \\"instructions for use\\" to be found through any of my internet searches. Due to the lack of instructions - I used this product only in the morning.<br /><br />The booklet of literature that came with the product outlines the entire beauty line and the benefits of each product.  The cover of the literature proudly proclaims \\"fytofontana cosmeceuticals - replacement of plastic surgery operations.\\"  This literature really tries to achieve a \\"scientific\\" look with a lot of pictures of test tubes, scientist who are gloved up testing products, lots of language that contains reduction percentages to support their clams, and some before and after photos.  It is clear that this literature is really striving to present a \\"scientific image\\" to back their claims of \\"significant results\\" after only 28-days.  The results outlined in the literature sound too good to be true and I couldn't help but wonder if the FDA might take exception to all the language of \\"proven effectiveness by laboratory in vitro measurements\\" bla, bla, bla.  Was it too good to be true?????  For me and my skin type - Yes.<br /><br />I also didn't care for the packaging of this product.  The glass bottle and glass eye dropper pipette simply unnerved me every time I opened the product.  I was so afraid that I was going to drop the bottle (or the dropper) in the porcelain sink or on the tile floor and then have broken glass (and an expensive skin product) everywhere.  In addition, I found that pulling the pipette in and out of the bottle often resulted in some spillage as droplets of the product ran down the neck of the bottle.  You REALLY have to have steady hands to use this product with no spillage.  I probably wouldn't have even noted this concern however you only apply a drop of this product for use therefore every drip running down the side of the bottle is basically one less use in the future (and this stuff is expensive).<br /><br />The gold color was not overly noticeable on my skin type (I have a medium complexion) and I actually liked how it initially \\"brightened\\" my skin tone however this didn't last once the product absorbed into the skin.  I didn't notice a glitter effect that another reviewer referenced.  This product is definitely NOT a moisturizer so if you experience dry skin and want to try this product you will need to use a moisturizing product after applying the Botoceutical Gold.  The recommendation of using only a drop of the product is surprisingly true.  This product really did go a long way and absorbed quickly into my skin - it just sadly didn't produce any results.  Although I do not have overly sensitive skin and not prone to breakouts, I did experience some acne breakouts that made me suspect that this product could be to blame since it was the only thing different in my beauty routine of cleaning, exfoliating, moisturizing, etc.<br /><br />In fairness, every skin type (just like hair type) is different so perhaps other users will have a different experience with this product.  Overall however I felt the claims in the literature were over inflated and too good to be true.  I was hopefully optimistic that I'd notice results as represented in the pamphlet however no such luck!
B005HK5MNI|5|The Herpes Simplex virus (or HSV) is a difficult disease. It is widely known as incurable, with painful skin lesions on sensitive areas of the body. The lesions reccur more often for some people than others - their 'outbreaks' tend to be related to periods of high-stress. Modern medicine does not offer a cure, though there are pharmaceutical preparations available to limit the frequency and duration of HSV outbreaks. With a reputation as 'incurable', 'painful', 'not-so-pretty', and varieties described as 'oral and labial' or 'genital', the disease can be a little challenging and embarrasing to say the least.<br />Well, I've been through this. I've had the painful lesions, had to deal with the regular outbreaks of painful cold-sores in my mouth and on my lips (I was blessed with the 'oral' variety). I've been through those great internal debates on how to break the news to a partner (thankfully always returning that look that says something like 'Oh! I thought you were going to tell me my cat just died...that's no big deal'). Though it still seemed like a big deal. Regularly having those few days of feeling like a flu was coming on, followed by a few days of outbreak - at what always seemed like the worst of times. On top of it, being an athlete, training really hard tended to cause outbreaks as well - weightlifting in particular. Maybe it was just really strenuous, or maybe I wasn't actually a 'weightlifter' - but that heavy lifting would almost always lead, once again, to an outbreak.<br /><br />Would I have to go through this forever? Would I always be taking prescription drugs to keep the virus at bay? I tried some natural routes; Lysine - an amino acid - seemed to help, but not all the time, and not unless I took it (and a LOT of it) before the outbreaks would occur. I used significant amounts of lip balm, as sun overexposure would again bring it on. I have a lot of years left! Will this always be a factor in my life?<br /><br />Then it so happened I got involved in essential oils - the powerful aromatic compounds distilled in small amounts from plants. You've probably heard of them - Lavender oil, Sandalwood, Frankincense, etc. They're getting to be fairly common these days. And then one day I stumbled onto research being performed with a particularly rare essential oil called 'Melissa' or 'Lemon Balm'. Melissa is steam distilled from the leaves of the Melissa herb - and in very small quanitities. The plant yields a small amount of oil relative to all the other aromatic plant species out there. Research has been being performed in Europe for several years applying Melissa oil to herpes outbreaks, with very interesting results. In fact, one German pharmaceutical company extracted the 'active' component of the oil and sold it in a prescription preparation for use by herpes 'sufferers'.<br /><br />The most encouraging statement regarding the use of Melissa on herpes was made by Dr. Dietrich Wabner, a professor at the University of Munich: he stated that a single application of Melissa may lead to a complete remission of the disease. A possible cure! I'd figured I had nothing to lose, so I tried a little bottle of the oil.<br /><br />Further research gave me a better idea of a protocol; direct application of the essential oil may not lead to a complete remission in one application - though healers were finding success with the oil's regular use through the course of several outbreaks. One drop of Melissa directly applied a few times a day throughout the outbreak, and for the next several times an outbreak was surfacing, might lead to remission of the disease. The regemine was to begin as soon as one felt an outbreak coming on - some folks get an odd sensation at the location where the lesion may occur, and many will feel a general malaise. My outbreaks tended to occur on my tongue at that point - I would get the flu/fatigued feeling, then a few tasted buds would swell and sting, with the occasional cold sore showing itself (and yes, this had been medically confirmed as HSV early on when the sored almost completely covered the roof of my mouth). So I started on the Melissa, placing just one drop in my mouth and 'swishing' it around a few times a day. It's a powerful oil, but I actually liked the taste...<br /><br />Well, I wasn't one of the fortunate one's with a complete remission on the first try. But it did help - the outbreaks were shorter, and then seemed to occur less frequently. THEN something WONDERFUL happened - the outbreaks stopped all together. And believe me, my life has been no less stressful - more so if anything. But no matter how hard my days were, how heavy my weight training sessions or other athletic endeavors, the outbreaks have not returned! No more unexplained low-level flu symptoms or sore spots in or on my mouth. I can't remember the last time this happened, and don't even keep the bottle around anymore just in case - though I do recommend it to those in a similar position.<br /><br />Now to those who may have more sensitive skin than I, Melissa can be diluted in a carrier oil (like Hazelnut or Rosehip Seed oil) down to 10% or less of the total concentration and still be just as effective - taking any essential oil orally, and undiluted certainly, should be done with caution - pay attention to your own reaction and proceed accordingly. I haven't any experience with the 'genital' variety of the virus, but I it should work just as well - though this is where the carrier oil might feel a little nicer. But whatever way it's used, the protocol should be followed as closely as possible: apply the oil a few times a day to the affected area as soon as you feel an outbreak coming on, and stick with it until the lesions have healed. Then do it again the next several times an outbreak is surfacing. There are no guarantees, but I do hope this wonderful natural medicine can provide the same relief for others as it has for me.<br /><br />For sufferer's of Shingles, another Herpes virus variety causing lesions of the skin, Ravensara (Ravensara aromatica, or 'True' Ravensara) oil has been used. Individuals have found relief using Ravensara in a 50-50 blend with Tamanu Nut oil. The Tamanu Nut sooths the skin during the healing process and keeps the Ravensara in contact with the sores. I have not heard of this offering a complete cure, but I have heard of this blend really helping relieve discomfort of this condition.<br /><br />If you decide to try these natural methods, when buying essential oils, buy from a trusted source - Melissa oil particularly has been adulterated due to it's high cost. The 'fake' mixture - a blend of Lemongrass and other essential oils oils - do not contain the same antiviral components. True Melissa is typically found in the range of $10 - $20 per milliliter, with organic varieties costing a little more. There are nearly twenty-five drops in one milliliter, and because only one drop is typically used for each application, a few milliliters (1/4 to 1/8th ounce) can go a long way. If you try this natural healing oil, or to recommend it to those in need, I wish the best of success!nd yes, this had been medically confirmed as HSV early on when the sored almost completely covered the roof of my mouth).

B008D8AFN8|5|I love this spray!!! I use this spray on my legs after I shave my legs. This sprays works great for razor bumps. I have really sensitive skin and it helps so much. I stand by this spray a 100% :)
B001ESC1O0|4|I like this shampoo. My daughter has very long and semi-curly hair, so we needed something with a detangler in it. It does the job, but theirs not quite enough moisturizer in it
B004X42RZA|5|It's lighter than expected, closer to my own natural lip color but totally buildable.
B000PJMPU4|3|I like how it has a stand and I can use it either way on my desk.  I was planning on mounting it when I bought it but I didn't realize it's held by 3 suction cups, and no nails/screws.  So it is just suctioned to my glass top desk.  Every time I turn it it starts becoming loose from it's post which is annoying.  And sometimes it slides out of the stand too.
B00M2DZTUY|5|I just got my Konjac Sponge and started using it so it's pretty soon to give a review about results but I think it's so different than anything I've ever used on my face.  It's a material like no other.  The sponge fills with water, stays filled while cleansing my face and somehow it dries really fast.  It has the sensation of exfoliating without any roughness.  It's really hard to describe. But I like it!
B00FULYKG4|5|This was a great update from the original.  There are two models of the new one...if you don't need all of the bells and whistles get the other model...my biggest concern was that the hinge was too loose...They fixed it in the new one and I don't even need the lock out feature.
B00005A43T|5|I love this hairdryer!  I have used them for about four years now, and alot of places are discontinuing them at the stores.  I found them on here, and got such an incredible deal, i ordered three!!!!  Not alot of hairdryers \\"Blow\\" as much air as this...they should keep this model, instead of all these new ones...the four other brands i have tried, i have returned, for the lack of air flow.  My only recommendation with this is that it gets hot, and if you shut it off on the hottest setting it will not kick on for a few minutes...i always put mine on cool for the last minute before shutting it off, and i dont have a problem...i think it's just a safety feature.  Keep this hairdryer Conair, and dont discontinue it!!!
B001F51R7E|2|I have been a Glide Dental floss user for a very long time.  It has always worked well for me given that I have closely spaced teeth and I need a wider waxed floss.  However, my most recent purchase at Costco is of a product that is not at all up to par as to what I had purchased previously.  The package marked &#34;Oral B Glide Pro-Health multi-protectrion floss, clean mint&#34; is not at all satisfactory.  This floss breaks very easily and I have to use multiple strips to get my teeth flossed.  Not only am I using lots of product, but the time it takes me to floss and the frustration is annoying.<br />What have you done to the product to make it so inferior to what you had been producing?<br />A very unhappy customer.
B00CNOUZE2|4|This truly is perfect for what it does.  I can't say I would have purchased it in the store because you wouldn't think it would work;.  Easy to hang and can't shatter and truly fogless
B000VWP2XW|5|im not sure how these other customers are using this or if they have some incredible blemishes but i have freckles and this covers them so well!! i dont feel like its stifling my pores! i bought this in a sephora and im now going to continue buying online!!! absolutely love it!!!
B003II0R7M|4|It works great but I don't like the ghostly look one gets when applying it and the size of the product is too small for the price charged. Nothing wrong with the product itself though.
B00HRJGI94|5|Great price for this kit!
B005NWO9G6|5|love it
B00KO8ZNJQ|5|I love it!
B000HWULKK|5|I never would have bought this item except for the favorable reviews.  That being said, I was amazed how well this product works!  It actually destroys odor and is refreshing to use.  Unlike other foot sprays, you do not choke on the fumes, get power all over the place, or destroy your pedicure.  Love this product!
B000WR28Y2|4|I wasn't expecting bubbles, but I got lots of them. The bath was soothing. It definitely was a good buy. I'll get lots of lavender soaks from this bottle.
B00CPOVL6Q|5|i love it that is the only  oil i use  now my friends have made me order for them too.
B006GQYSC8|1|From all the reviews, I thought this shaver was going to be the answer, ending having to by replacement blades.  But this shaver did not do a very good job on my beard, which is light, either wet or dry.  I did send it back with no hassles.
B002CSPKSU|4|i have been buying this product for the past 2 years and it has done wonders, i go from really bad break outs to clear skin as soon as i use the products. its very gentle and it never dried or made my face itch like it happened with proactive before. if you had to buy one product alone i would recommend the clear pore serum its amazing! it literally reduces those big pimples to nothing in two nights. i have recommended it to friends and they all love it. if you can just try it for yourself. the first time i tried it i was googling for best acne products and i ended up in their website and ever since it has not failed me.  the bad is that the cloth after so many uses you  have to get a new one since it absorbs a lot of impurities from your face. But a new one comes with every kit so no biggie.
B0039UTO3W|5|This is my favorite mascara, and I've used it for years. I think it really elongates and thickens my lashes, while still appearing somewhat natural.
B00CNOUZE2|5|Excellent product --- as advertised!  Very easy to install; no water reservoir required; just a simple design that actually provides a fogless mirror experience ... imagine that!
B00L9IWVIQ|5|Great product. Rich consistency, very hydrating. My skin is so much smoother after one week. Will buy again.
B000A3XH16|5|Love, this skin cream.  Both me and my boy friend highly recommend.  This is wonderful product.  Goes on smoothly and is so great on my type of skin(which can be slightly dry, even in the summer)
B00C61F1C8|5|I purchased them at a very cheap price and even though they take a while to actually get to my mailbox, It was worth it. There's no way that you can find these cheaper and at the same great quality any where else.
B003CYKP3S|5|I've used a couple of times and a little goes a long way, which is great!  Lots of foamy bubbles to tickle the skin and leaves no residue on the tub...a definite bonus!
B00GUNYDAE|1|No point to this product.  Does not cover the entire foot with leaving the toes exposed.
B000186XAM|4|Works great.
B007R69KEC|5|Love this product.I live in the Caribbean and it gets HOT. My hair basically turns into a shrub. This product moisturizes my hair well and it smells very very good. Best smelling hair product I've ever had :) Strangely, it is imported and sold in our local beauty stores at a cheaper price than this amazon store.<br /><br />Still strongly recommend the product for moisturizing.
B003RJTTE4|5|Best price on the internet if you consider shipping. Very happy with purchase.
B003LY8J2S|4|My son like it
B0017BI80K|1|Received this product in which many of the nail tips were broken.  There were no wells in tios and tips were vety very thin, I don't think using this product will give my clients elegant durable nails.
B00ADRHABW|5|it works for me
B006CAR91K|5|These are great dotting tools, decent quality.  Clean off easily with polish remover.  Couldn't ask for a better price!  I love the colors too!
B001MP2PYG|4|This warmer is much easier to keep clean than gigi warmers. Wish there was a better solution for the stick rest, but overall I believe these are a good product. Much cheaper than going to a salon for waxing.
B00T7WNHK2|5|I received the Ocean Breeze Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel and I love it!! First off, to open the can all you have to do is spin the top which I really like. It's a little thing but it sets it apart from all the other shaving gels. The scent is light but pleasant and my wife loves it. I only shave about twice a week with shaving cream (the other days I shave with my electric razor) but the past couple of times I've used this new Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel and have to say that I'm hooked. My skin is smooth, it gave me a super close shave, and even though I sweat a ton from working outside as a lineman my face is still hydrated at the end of the day. I can't wait to try the other scents...<br /><br />I received this product for free from Gillette in return for my honest opinion!
B001KYW7KQ|5|Great
B00776CLLG|5|This is the fourth natural sunscreen I have tried, and it's the last. Truly the easiest to apply ever!!! It is not really a fine mist spray like you might think, it comes out like a lotion, but absorbs fast and easy. Love it!!!
B00TWQCUX8|2|This product is not as good as it was explained on the website, still cannot take out the dark spot on my face not even lighten up the spots
B000FQTS4I|5|Not sure if this product actually regrows your hair as I use Rogain (works fantastic) but it for sure does make your hair thicker in appearance.  Very cleansing and leaves your hair very manageable. For the money you can't make a mistake.
B00EO7YDGW|5|These ultra portable wipes are excellent for anyone with chronic oily skin.
B006JZ0IQG|5|Love this soft little brush! It's tiny enough to fit anywhere and it works perfect if you just want to apply blush to the apples of your cheeks - plus it's just so darn cute!!
B004JZMWLW|5|I like these Screwdrivers a lot.<br /><br />You can use the Small Screwdriver many ways. Slice open an Envelope. Remove a Label. Pick your teeth. Pry open something small.<br /><br />Of course I tighten my glasses about once a week.
B00BB5YI0G|3|all the attachments are nice, and the rechargeable feature is amazing, but I find the smallest detail trimmer gets very very hot. I like to use them around my eyebrow area, and I have to do small spots at a time to cool it down
B000KEFVGY|5|Very impressed. Only this, and product called Barc which is no longer available, have ever worked for me. I've tried everything to stop the in-grown hairs. Too many products have alcohol, which after a week only makes the problem worse. This product is perfect and I saw results within a few day. A little expensive but worth it because I've tried so many other things with no success. Would recommend using a light moisturizer after applying.
B004QDPVO2|1|The original ad said: Original, Extra-hold dippity do, #1. It had a picture of the THAT bottle which is green.  This one just isn't the same - AND it cost me a lot of money!  The one that came is in the blue bottle and says: Extra, light, #7.
B008DWSJ1O|5|I absolutely LOVE this product! I never color my hair anymore because the color is never what I want and my hair is left dry and unmanageable, only to end up brassy and coarse within a couple weeks. This hair color was the exact opposite of what I have experienced with hair color in the past. The color is so natural and rich. At the same time my hair is soft and shiny. I tell everyone I know to use this color. I'm so happy with it!
B004D8T7F4|5|Best for natural hair!
B000AMDOAQ|5|Just started using it, was amazed by how quickly my hair dries.  I don't care if they smell eventually, this is worth it.  This is much better than those dollar store towels or a regular cotton towel.  Bought one for my mom and one for my suitcase.
B00OGDDWPM|5|I have used many eyelash serums in the past, and by far, this is the absolute best!  Before I purchased reLASH, I considered the reviews, both positive and negative; but in the end I made the decision to purchase reLASH. I am glad I did and I am one satisfied customer.  I actually noticed increased lash growth in about 3 weeks.  I will definitely purchase again.
B00BFFQMBA|5|Fuller Bangs and Less Hair in the Drain-Five Stars    I have been taking the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement twice daily now for a few weeks.  I have very coarse hair and I've had a lot of breakage issues because of coloring it for years.  This week I had my roots colored by my regular hairdresser, and he noticed a significantly less amount of hair loss in the drain when he washed my hair.  He has commented on it often which has really stressed me out.  My hair seems overall a bit shinier, and the really awesome thing, which I hope will only get better as I continue taking this supplement, is that the hair growth of my bangs, on my temple where I part my hair, is already noticeably fuller.  I've had these whispy little baby hairs for a long time that don't grow, and now it looks like some real hair is growing in.  You can't go wrong using this product.  There is absolutely no con in my opinion, as the vitamins are primarily B vitamins which are good for your heath on all counts.
B009653PQ6|3|This is ok
B0092ZNKV0|5|This product it original and really works . I only use false lashes on special occasions and photo shootings. I was really new at applying the lashes but this definitely helped me. So glad I found it online since sephora does not sell it in their website. I definitely recommend it.
B0069SQEK2|5|I use peppermint oil for headaches.  It even works great when I have a migraine.
B000O7AI3I|5|This is the ONLY face cream I can use. Everything else makes my eczema break out. I'll buy this for the rest of my life!
B000ILZT5W|5|It feels like I've spent years looking for that perfect bronzer. You know the one: It helps you look darker but in a natural way. Shimmery, but now showy. One that's not heavy and doesn't make you break out. One that doesn't look streaky. I never found one I liked.<br /><br />The Body Shop's Bronzing Powder is by far the best bronzer I've ever used. I got a big brush with it and simply brush it on evenly every morning (after washing my face). Sometimes I'll put some clinique powder over it (to get rid of shine) but sometimes I simply wear the bronzer.<br /><br />Using a big brush allows you to apply it evenly and it actually looks quite natural. Sometimes I'll brush it on my neck and chest too for a more natural look. It's super light so I don't feel like I'm wearing gobs of makeup.<br /><br />Body Shop's bronzer helps me feel a bit healthier in the winter months where I'm generally quite pale. I'm ready to buy my third compact of it and don't see myself switching any time soon. I generally use shade 02... I'm pretty pale but with an olive complexion.
B002Z7EOOE|5|I got this item purposely following on the Deep penetrating version of 7 in One Total Effect products. They are really good products which indeed make good efforts towards exfoliating the skin. They are highly moisturised; though I did not find the moisturiser lotion to complement the products. Perhaps I could have got some wonderful results if I were able to combine them. But the sellers I tried refused to send them to me to the United Kingdom.  and on trial basis. I must say here that I am still on my second bottle and it is the reason I cannot give the full mark. The manufacturers need to strive harder to ensure that they are available at reasonable prices all over the world.
B00XWYHZA4|5|My lips are always dry and chapped.  I've used all sorts of lip balm - Chap Stick, Carmex, blistex and none of them make your lips feel naturally moist like this. Not to mention, it lasts much longer than any other. You don't have to keep reapplying, but you'll want to because they taste so delicious. I will be a customer for life.
B007M81AAC|5|Used 2 nights in a row and my skin already looks better.
B004ZWH5AM|5|really love this stuff. can't find it in stores anymore and wish it wasn't so expensive
B00016WULK|1|Avalon ruined this wonderful product when they made it &#34;more sustainable&#34;.  Complaints are rampant and warranted.  Don't waste your money - it's chalky and gross.  Shame on you Avalon!
B0081MQ47C|3|This was delivered March 29, 2015. After charging it would last almost two weeks.  Suddenly last week it will only hold a charge for two to three days with similar usage. I purchased this to replace an 3 year old oral B for the same reason.
B002XQ1X4G|1|This is a nice scent for women to wear but not men. If however you do choose to wear it only apply 1 spray to the back of knee area, otherwise it will be nauseating all day for you and others around you. It smells good when you try it in the store on a paper strip, but when it hits the skin it transforms to a girly scent. This is a good scent at a concert or any place where you will sweat alot.
B00BB8ZIRK|5|This is a fantastic flat iron! It heats up quickly and lets you know when it is completely heated (it beeps). The display is easy to read and aesthetically  pleasing. The flat iron is easy to use, and the 1 inch ceramic plates are of high quality. When you use it, it does not tug or pull on your hair, it glides over it like any good flat iron should.I have had more expensive flat irons before, but this flat iron is better than my previous ones!  I recommend this product.
B007FMXL52|4|Seems to get most of the chlorine out of the hair, and leaves hair feeling moisturized and softt. But comes in a rather small size.
B001KYRRLA|4|Way way better than the Almay true Coverage.  This has the correct &#34;thickness&#34; and texture to last all day.  I actually keep it in the fridge in a small compartment.  Very Refreshing.
B001BWE90I|3|too short for a big guy
B00NMOS058|5|These pads are everything! I have had combination, acne prone, AND super sensitive skin all my life, and have used just about any and every product out there. These Magic Pads are the first product to completely combat my acne, nourish my skin, and improve its overall look/tone and texture all at once! I noticed a huge change after my FIRST time using them, and received compliments on my skin after the second day. I cannot recommend these pads enough. I love these pads because above all else, they're made with natural ingredients and aren't harsh on my sensitive skin. Do yourself a favor and grab at least two of these. I promise you won't regret it--they're worth every single penny.
B000TZT9E4|5|This product is for thick hair however, I have super fine hair and it makes the best curls. I repeat, the BEST curls. Works even better when you use a curling wand but will give your hair curl regardless.
B004OZW7PS|5|I use this in conjunction with Native Remedies CataractClear for an eye flare up and when you can't get to the ophthalmlogist right away. Highly recommend.
B00141VFP8|1|The lip balm was dry - it must have been very old. Very disappointed. Cannot use. Would never order again. I have purchased before from Sephora and it was great!
B0080CO2F4|5|I bought this hair clip because I love unique accessories. I gave it to my mother who wears her hair in a chignon most of the time and it looks lovely. The price cannot be beaten either!
B005LDFPFQ|5|Makes my extension lashes shiny and pretty
B005Y4CW0I|5|Works for the purpose I needed, I added to my first aid kit for minor scrapes with my little one.  If you love the smell of Italian food, you will smell like a pizza parlor.
B000NWGCZ2|2|I bought this cream because it didn't have a lot of chemicals in it but something it has in it makes my hands swell. I won't be buying it again.
B00340T6XU|5|I have used this product 3 times now and see a HUGE difference in my skin.  My pores look smaller, and as I am lighter skinned my skin looks almost porcelain like.  This product DOES get a bit clumpy as the one negative reviewer stated but when you rub your skin with it, there is definitely skin coming off.  I have had no adverse reaction to the peel other then some skin getting a little dry which I expected.  I looked at page after page of web sites looking for bad reviews and found only the one on this site.  That leads me to believe while it may not work for everyone, it certainly works for most.  Good luck!!
B00022AUME|4|Very smooth for a single blade
B003MJ7Z0O|5|Great for the skin  Quality produce at a great price  This bottle will last at LEAST 6 months.  I will be reordering.  My skin feels and looks better after using this product.
B0006SFXXK|5|I am late 50's and have long very fine mid chest length dark blonde hair, with natural gold (and increasingly silvery) highlights. It's not styled, just trimmed occasionally and I've worn it the same all my life. This winter it suddenly become unmanageable...the bottom half dry, like straw, the top still oily enough to need washing every other day. It tangled all the time and I had to wear it in a braid while I slept or wake up to big tangled mats.<br /><br />My local supermarket carries this line and I tried samples of this, the hair milks and the argan oil. This one, as a leave in conditioner/ detangler is fantastic for me. I don't use conditioner anymore in the shower. I wash my hair, get out of the shower, put about a quarter size dollop or two in my palms and rub it into the bottom half of my wet tangled hair. If it still feels dry I might add a bit more. I run the last bit left on my hands lightly on the tangles at the upper half of my head. I don't wash it out and I have not had to wash my hair any more often since using this.<br /><br />This product detangles my hair perfectly but also makes the bottom look conditioned and healthy. It restored my hair within a week. I have even diluted this with a bit of water in my palm and used it on the lower third of my dry hair on the days I did not wash it. The milks were too heavy to use this way, and the argan oil way too greasy.<br /><br /> It's been three weeks and my hair looks better than it has in years. Love this product, the scent is minimal and pleasant.
B001DNE3KQ|5|I use this every day and it is great.  The display will say 10% for weeks, so not sure how accurate that is.  It provides a great shave though, and that's what it is all about.
B008277ZMO|5|Protects the skin really well and smells good. I use it with both cloth and disposable diapers.<br /><br />Need<br />More<br />Words
B0001EL41Y|5|Great to use under latex gloves
B002QKDQ1C|1|16 Feb<br /><br />I got rid of this a day later.  It is foul-smelling [B002QKDQ1C].  Years ago, I had Avon's \\"Hawaiian White Ginger\\" (roll-on) whenever I wore it people would say, \\"I smell the beach.\\"  This smells like something unpleasant cooking.
B00JQQMWKA|5|Awesome Product!
B00336EUTK|4|I don't usually use any whitener products because of sensitive gums and teeth, but these don't bother me at all.  I'm a coffee and wine drinker and these really worked.  I noticed after about 11 days that my teeth were whiter.
B0009OAHCS|5|Five star service....couldn't have been better....Thanks Again
B0065K6R6A|3|Make this twice as big and I'll take three please! Well, got it to hold brushes... Really just too small.. Largest cup was okay but that's it... So therefore using it for all my tools. My tweezerman hair and face scissors, nail pushy and cleaner, slant and pointed tweezers, big cup has gentle eye lash curler by bobbi brown, and Dior heated lash curler.. Finding more tools too!! Fill it with beads or filler so they stand. I'd be so much  happier if it was twice the size, but still I can use... Great packaging and came on time..!! Good quality too;)
B00AAZR75G|5|Albeit more of a wax / pomade hybrid than a clay, It really does the job well. I was in search for a less expensive alternative to Aveda grooming clay, and this was a blind purchase in the search.
B003AGMUMW|5|The scent is AMAZING. Its pleasant and not overpowering, and it was a smell i just enjoy.<br /><br />Use as LITTLE as possible. this will not only make it last longer, but when you use too much i find my skin feels a bit greasy to the touch, which is something i have not experienced with my TOBS sandalwood aftershave gel. This is also more of a lotion, mine was kind of runnier than i expected, and if i leave it open upside down it will drip out. If it were a little thicker i wouldn't mind. If it stayed exactly the same, i wouldn't mind.<br /><br />This does what it's supposed to beautifully, it soothes any razor burn you might have, smells AMAZING, and when used in just right amounts, leaves my skin feeling super smooth and irresistible. Buy this now!
B006LRRQK8|5|Perfect lashes
B002OGVI0O|5|I am 45 looking 28 fresh and I will not stop taking this product. My cellulite disappear , I can exercise more and I don't feel body aches so much and my skin is so thick and firm.
B001EWEPAE|4|A great buy. I will purchase again for the wife. I nice find / deal. I'm not gonna let this one go.
B00NO8DT2G|5|THE BEST smelling and best tasting lip balm EVER! My lips feel pretty fabulous now after using this for a day. (They had been a little sad with the winter weather!)
B000NL0T1G|4|Shaves as good as my old mac 3 with less irritation.
B00005373I|5|Does what it's supposed to do!
B0000AFUT3|5|This is by far the best lighted mirror I have ever owned. I don't use it to apply makeup, as, I have, unfortunately for a woman, a very hairy chin. This mirror is very bright and since the bulbs are fluorescent they don't get extremely hot or blind me after using it for a while. It also has a 5X magnification which allows me to see every little whisker, making it very easy for me to pluck them. I have owned similar items over the years, but this one deserves laurels!
B003YCIAX0|5|Works well but you will be made fun of.
B000E9A6N8|4|I liked this eyeliner because it didn't smudge or run.  The only thing is I wish I had picked a darker shade. It was kind of light and didn't apply as smoothly as I would have liked.
B002HK2GLW|5|I love the blunted ends while trimming facial hair.  Keeps my face safe while make me look better.
B000NCVAC2|4|Good stuff! Tried for the first time and my hobbit feet suddenly had sensation...like I was aware of the soft fibers of my bedroom rug. One application did not miraculously cure my cracked heels. But it does smell purty.
B0041PMZCG|5|Great product at a fantastic price.  You are getting 6.8 oz for below costs for a 5oz tube in stores.  Buyer is fast and always able to address any questions.
B0006O2GNO|5|I have to say that this product, for me, has lived up to it's claims. I have been dealing with a weird, itchy kind of dandruff forever and have tried dozens of different over the counter shampoos. This is the first one that has not made my scalp break out and has mostly stopped the itch. I have only used it once so far, but I believe that over time it will be even more effective. I have long, fine hair so I was worried about tangles since there wasn't a matching conditioner, but this shampoo left my hair feeling very soft and silky, and for that alone I think it was worth it. Hopefully I will continue to have great results, but so far, I'm off to a great start and couldn't be happier! You'll be hearing from me if my experience somehow changes!
B00L4FNIA4|5|Beautiful,  finely milled pressed powders. Works great!
B00IMHN0B4|5|This rose water is the best I have ever used! I used other rose waters from other brands but this one makes me the happiest! When I put it on my hair especially it feels so much more smooth and shinier. It's better than the effects my shampoo and conditioner use, I just spray it on my hair and the scent is so good! When I don't dilute the rose water, the scent can linger, but I love that because I can use it as a healthy perfume. People have complimented that it looked soft and smooth, and when they touched it, they told me it felt just like how it looked! I loved those compliments, and this really hydrates the skin as well! I use it on dry skin and this can health soothe it and get the dryness to pass. I am not going to stop ordering these, it really is the best I ever used!
B00J9OMPH4|5|Always love using this for my baby .<br />Great for colic problem. Good to use to massage babies tummy too .
B001DYM618|4|i honestly wish it came with an instruction manual on how to put the blade in but after 15 minutes of trying i finally got it so its in great condition and worked fine.
B002B8VE4U|4|I have for a long time a smaller in the same brand, also it can folder , the size was  the better.
B006H9CIV2|3|This product is just ok - not as rich as I expected.  During the dry winter months, my sensitive skin requires a heavier cream that provides a high level of moisture.  This does not fit that bill.  I personally don't find it to be any better than the well-known drug store brands.<br /><br />No need to spend this much for an ok moisturizer.
B0020MMAT0|5|this is a brand I used in my teens (other scents) and I love this  new fragrance. Very soft and long lasting. It puts me in a happy space.
B0002JTCPS|5|This was a gift for my mom. Awesome thank you
B004IQIC6Q|4|Great products
B000WN5K0A|5|This is absolutely gorgeous and perfect for my nieces sweet 16. Thank you
B0089GNX88|5|I chose to rate it a 5, because it is doing exactly what it is supposed to be doing. The product arrived on time and is a wonderful product from the motherland
B002TSA90W|4|feel good after showering with this soap.
B006J7TZ3G|4|This stuff is amazing! It changes the entire texture of my hair without damage! I really didn't think that was possible but it is. It's a time consuming process but lasts for months afterward. You can apply this product even to previously processed hair and it really improves damaged hair. I bought 2 huge containers because I'm a customer for life!! I recommend this product to women with curly, frizzy or ethnic hair that needs some taming.
B00EA5AA42|3|despite all the positive reviews, I could not get this polish on my nails without streaks.<br />I gave it several tries, but did not get the results that I had hoped for.<br />The polish lasted ok, as far as durability, but it was very streaky. I tried several very thin coats, but no success.
B00005JS5C|4|I decided I did not want anymore bikini waxing and needed to resort to trimming myself, This was easy to use and shaved just enough. I recommend this product.
B00H6TPT90|3|I have another product I'm using by skin medica and I like it better. I will give this product a fair try. It leaves a dry waxy feel to my face?
B000O3VRTQ|5|I got this as a gift and was shocked by how effective it was. I haven't been to the dentist for a long time so I have a big cavity and pockets that I need to deal with. Dreading THE chair, I've been putting it off. But dealing with the 'cavity taste' has been nasty. I have all sorts of hi-tech 'weapons' in my bathroom, including a Sonicare toothbrush, Colgate Advanced+ sensitive, Waterpik, even good old dental floss. None of them got rid of the taste. Then I added CloSYS to the regimen. It tastes like water, there was no abrasive taste to it. So it's easy to hold it in your mouth for a minute or two or even longer while you go about with other tasks. It was fantastic! There was no after taste of any sorts, but instantly the bad taste in my mouth was gone. And it stayed gone for almost 24 hours.  I'm sure if I have used it twice/day it would have stayed gone. And even when it came back, it was weak in comparison to before-use. The cavity even calmed down a bit. I have only used this one time and I am impressed already! It's also great how concentrated it is, so packing it with a luggage would be a breeze. CloSYS is definitely the 'strong, silent type'. There is no fancy packaging and it tastes like water, but it gets the job done.
B001V9MTOY|4|When spring arrives and the air is full of tree pollen this helps deal with the itchy eyes. Will continue to purchase until something better comes along.
B003949V36|5|This mask is a product I find easy to use, leaves skin looking refreshed following use.  Would recommend this product
B004BVYT2Y|3|It will lift your face but it is very difficulty to hide the adhesive lifts
B002IACDGY|5|I did a rather extensive search and review of flat irons before I decided to purchase this as a present for my upper teen daughter. I was intrigued by the various qualities of  the product--it sounded good, especially in regard to not being damaging to the hair. My daughter loves it!  Her hair is long and has been damaged from previous flat irons, hair coloring, etc. Her hair is shiny and smooth after use of the Croc. She also reports that it heats up very quickly--which she likes, and does not burn her hair.
B0046VGPHQ|4|Works flawlessly not as dark as I hoped but still the smoothness and evenness makes up for it. I recommend this for anyone who hates streaks.
B000WM3I64|5|It works very well on my extremely dry hands.  I use the day cream during the day and love it also.
B0050OL23K|5|My all time favorite perfume. Arrived quickly. Awesome smell awesome price. Very happy.
B00253NDS6|1|I was not impressed with this product. The color is nice. It has that old smell and doesn't stay on like it says. Way to much money for this. I found loreal & Revlon lip stains that are way cheaper & better quality.
B001FWXS88|5|I just Crest the last time I was in the US and since than.    I asked my mother to buy it for me, but she couldn't find it anywhere.    Finally I found it on Amazon and order a lot of it right away.    Great toothpaste which is mild and not so domestic with the mint taste.    Why is it so hard to find and buy?
B00NN4ZC4Y|5|Love this color. I am in love with the sally hansen gel system. It's super easy to use and it lasts on my nails at least 10-14 days. This color is one of my favorites, it comes out looking just like the box and I have not experienced that with some of their other colors. It's a cool, electric blue.
B000PXYAL2|3|Larger brush roll bristles tend to fall out easily. Smaller brush roll bristles work better.
B0015KXNO4|5|I love this product, I use it every morning and evening on the bottoms of my feet, my wrists and the back of my neck and I feel great. would highly recommend this and also Valor intensifies every other young living oil you use so that's a BONUS
B0056PDLUU|5|Good!
B009LLDAK6|1|The description says 4 standard heads, but I received 4 compact heads.
B006L1DNWY|5|they are really good, and brushes of all different thicknesses, i am excited to try them out!! I dont really know what else to say about them...
B00F7QJ8QE|5|Long time user of Mary Kay. I love all the products.
B003983HZK|5|thank you, everything is fine!
B0060EWSTG|5|Do like the body lotion a lot.
B007D24HSO|5|This cologne is the best!  My husband wears it often and he loves it too!  I think that this cologne would be best for guys that are a little older. The smell is for a more mature audience.  Enjoy!
B0009OAHC8|4|There was a time where being a funky homosapien was a cool thing.  Well I decied to change it with this.  Now I'm swimming in more than just cool water...know what I'm saying?
B0027LSEPS|5|I rarely write reviews, however, I am so appreciative to those before me who gave positive reviews which led me to buy this product, that I feel compelled to pay it forward for those who may be considering this purchase.  I originally purchased this product in preparation with plans to begin wearing braces.  I was looking for a portable Waterpik that I could carry in my purse and take with me everywhere. Well, the Panasonic Oral Irrigator is a product that I hope to have with me for the rest of my lifetime, long after my stint with braces has come to an end.  The product is amazing.  I find it to be comparably as powerful as the Waterpik Ultra counter-top model (on moderate settings) that I purchased at the same time, as long as the batteries are kept fresh.  My husband loved it so much, I purchased another within a few days so he could have one with him at all times. I rarely use our counter-top Waterpik these days because the Panasonic Oral Irrigator is simply more convenient and just as effective in my opinion.  I love to use mouthwash with it and wherever I go, it goes.  This is a truly outstanding product and a must for anyone who is striving for impeccable oral hygiene.
B001AEF5EQ|4|I would recommend peptide 6 because it has improved my wrinkle on eyelids and sagging face tremendously..
B0039OZ4C8|5|excellent prodcut
B002SICFN2|1|Just doesn't work.
B0008GIZKS|5|Exactly as advertised
B003KWZ8VG|4|I purchased this after seeing all of the great reviews and wanted something less drying and harsh for my oily, acne prone skin.  I am impressed with this toner.  There is still alcohol in it (not sure how much) but it is not as much as other toners and has not stung my face.  You can absolutely smell the tea tree oil but this is not bothersome to me.  I like that it has the salicylic because I used a benzo peroxide cream which is a good combo for my pimples.<br /><br />A con that causes me to give it 4 stars would be the price for the bottle.  I am used to larger bottles for less but since this is mostly natural and Burt's Bees I expect this.  The liquid is a bit thin (if that makes sense) so sometimes I need to saturate the cotton ball a bit more.  My skin is a bit clearer but I am not sure if this is due to BHA treatment I also started along with this toner.<br /><br />My pimples have been kept at bay and this has a nice feel to it.  It does not over dry my oily dry and the alcohol is not overbearing.  I see myself buying this again.
B00641UCY8|5|I really like this product.  Its detangling properties are effective.  I use a wide tooth shower comb to massage through my hair, although I could use my fingers. I used to buy an expensive non-sudsing cleansing conditioner from QVC. This is better in price, amount needed, and effect.
B007SNGSFS|4|it does what its supposed to do.  Good, good good good good good good good good good good good good
B00P9G4UQA|3|I was looking for a hanging bag that lays flat.  I did use it and it was a bit bulky.  It is nicely made and has a large compartment to store things.
B000C1Z1NI|5|I have used this perfume for years and love it. I received it very promptly and as ordered. Thanks!
B00005NFBJ|5|I love this mask.  Peeling off is like other masks and stings some but end result is such smooth skin.  I am so glad I ordered two.
B0029UTNH0|5|but it was expired when it got to me
B005TWGOYA|5|It's my favorite non - rinse product! I like it so much!  My hair looks much better, smooth, soft, sparkling!!!
B00BEWWBXW|4|I bought this product with the expectation that it would be 'permanent' as the box states. It's not really permanent at all. It washed out pretty quickly.<br />This isn't to say I'm unhappy with the product. It costs about as much as my usual semi-permanent dye, but smells and feels ten times better.<br /><br />A lot of previous reviews have commented on the awkward shape of the applicator. I feel the opposite. The applicator never slipped out of my hands, I found it easier to maneuver with, and it didn't leave any rings of dye on my bathroom counter.<br /><br />Don't expect salon quality endurance, but it's still worth the money.<br /><br />-Pros-<br />Smells delicious<br />Thick and easy to apply<br />Pretty packaging<br />Cheap-ish<br />Beautiful color<br />I liked the applicator,<br />so this is going in the pros.<br /><br />-Cons-<br /><br />Not permanent (lasts about as long as semi-permanent dye)<br />Because the product is thick, you have to work a little harder to get into harder to saturate areas.<br />Strange texture for the first day or so after coloring. (I may not have rinsed it out completely. This may be on me.)
B005DBPGOQ|5|This Shampoo is awesome. It is the only one that has really worked for the flakes that drop on my husbands suit jackets.<br />No more flakes!
B00R42M8OS|5|BEST EBER! :D
B007O7AYYE|5|i love it very much. very useful and of high quality. very light and soft. product using a very liking.
B00K6COL9S|1|Breaks easy
B00BFF4N66|5|Acne all gone
B0006NXQF2|5|Great stuff! Came super fast!
B0013L3XMM|5|Works as described and I actually saw results within a month of even occasional use.  Did buy again.
B00JRK55HW|5|This is the best brush ever.  My daughter hated her hair brushed before.  No more tears after using this brush.  Now my sons are using it.  We have several in of these.  We keep this one in the car.
B00I8H6E1G|4|It doesn't really look like a person, more like an elf. Besides this the mannequin is sturdy and served the purpose it was meant for.
B001PHHUMI|5|This thing made my wife's Christmas last year. She was so excited to receive it as a gift - and I was her Christmas Hero. She has been using DevaCurl products for a long time, and nothing makes her hair take on its natural curls like DevaCurl products. She uses it when she doesn't have time to pin up her hair, or when she is really out to impress.<br /><br />Her curls are very bouncy, and when every other product failed - this one came through for her. If you have curly hair, there is nothing better. GET IT!
B00BMUXQ6W|5|Really like the matte finish!
B00IS8PLFA|5|Not having had much luck in the past with supplements of any kind I purchased some True Pheromones with a healthy dose of skepticism. Nevertheless, I wanted to try them having studied in school the important roll they play in the animal kingdom. A buck deer in the fall won't think twice about challenging a hunter caught off guard who foolishly smeared &#34;deer scent&#34; on himself from head to toe. Well as you may have guessed, I was pleasantly surprised to see a noticeable change in those I interact with on a regular basis, but also a subtle change in my own behavior. Without feeling &#34;drugged&#34; in any way I became more sociable and willing to engage others in conversation that just seemed to flow quite naturally. The same was true for folks I came in contact with throughout the day. Those who were likely to say hi in passing before often stopped for a brief friendly conversation now.<br /><br />I think I set my expectations at a moderate level and am quite pleased with the results. I recommend giving it a try if only for the fun you might have.
B004ZLZR8A|4|Smells amazing! Pretty good hold.
B000NN7FSO|4|This product is really good; my scarves in my face are a bit less visible now.  I am using this product for over 1 month now.    Too bad this product is not for sale in Holland! I have to re order soon.
B007M81A6G|5|Best I've ever found.  Dr. Oz was right on this one.
B00C9VSILG|5|love it
B001TEE494|5|want to take care of my new clippers, ordered this as suggested to do, all I know is that the clippers work really well everytime and I use frequently when clipping my dogs, keeps it running smooth
B00RDN9I3M|5|Perfect and less expensive than name-brand replacements!
B00CQ1BU7I|5|Brings back memories, first cologne I wore as a teeny-popper.....40 yrs ago:-)!! Still has that wonderful smell!!
B00LVPDBA4|5|good
B00NTB6CPE|1|This did nothing for my hair, if anything, it pulled more hair out than my last set of brushes. Will not buy again!
B00SMIIR0W|5|Best Razor on the Market. Now, I have been a loyal customer of the Intuition brand razors because of the convenience of not having to use shaving cream... But one of my biggest issues with Intuition was that my bikini area was infinitely more dificult to shave/trim.<br /><br />Long story short, I have less ingrown hairs, shave less often and I don't need to use multiple trimming tools, scissors etc to neaten things up a bit down there if ya know what I mean!!<br /><br />I #gotitfree from BzzAgent.com, but you can believe I'll be back to buy another if this one ever breaks on me... or if I wear it out (which is a much more likely situation).
B003SG1UKM|5|the best
B00CB6BIYS|5|very pleased!
B00AZBVKAS|5|I bought for myself n sister in law n we luv it we're already guna buy some more cuz we are all out will be buying more from this seller
B00GDY680I|5|My daughter loves this! She gets this for $10 verses the exact same product at Ulta for $40.
B001FSHISI|5|These are the perfect small size for purses, in a make up holder, gym bags... They are of good quality. The lids fit well and are easy to put on. I use all of mine. I especially like the one with holes to sift. I use it to put my bare essentials 30 spf powder and use a make up brush, and it is ideal. Thumbs up for this kit. I need to order more!
B00142DT2O|2|The witch hazel seems to work as well as the kind from the bottle, but these little wipes are very small and probably only useful if you need them on the go. I put them in my medicine kit to use on bug bites.
B00008LUP3|5|I've used so many masks promising help with oily, acne prone skin, but this is the first one that honestly made a noticeable difference after the first application.  <br /> <br />It evens my skin tone remarkably well and even improves the rate at which the few acne lesions that aren't prevented heal, with relatively little drying.  <br /> <br />It's worked very well for me.
B00GOYH4PA|4|Good product at a good price. Great for face and nails.
B005T6LO64|4|I bought this as a trial and have been pretty pleased.  Not everything it promises, but is does add moisture to dry hair that is color treated.  I was not as pleased with the overall manageability of my hair, which is usually easy.  They have other products, but I don't want to spend a lot for extra stuff...
B009GEUPPG|5|I use this lotion as a primer before makeup.  The texture is perfect and it makes my makeup go on much smoother and more evenly.  I don't think this product has sunscreen in it, but my makeup does so it's okay.  Finally, a face lotion where my face doesn't look greasy but is moisturized!!!  Thank you, Olay!
B006WVCCSE|5|This is a great 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.  Helps remove excess buildup in your hair - smells great.  It is one of our favorite shampoos
B00HA0ZREW|4|The belt buckle was fine, but since the belt I had ordered to use it with turned out to be cheap and I was never able to find a belt I wanted I attempted to return this.  But something didn't work right with the websight, so Amazon customer service contacted the seller to allow me to return.  The seller kept telling me to go to the websight to  get turn in approval even after I explained completely why I couldn't.  Therefore I have made a note to myself to NEVER buy from that seller again
B000V5OQNG|5|I found this lipstick mentioned on Remodelista.  It was a true red, a hard color to find.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon and bought it right away.  The color will always be in my lipstick collection.  My pal from babyhood who now lives in Wisconsin bought it, too.
B0014568D8|4|Works well.  Helps keep hair in place without using spray. For short styles it really is perfect.  My only complaint is that it is a bit &#34;sticky&#34; when first using and stays that way.  I have found that by continuing to work it through the hair eliminates more of the stickiness.  Otherwise, a good product.
B005OKPZR4|5|Helps lot's with my dry skin. This cold weather has just been awful on my skin. Especially my hands getting dry
B002WTCD9I|5|I LOVE this curling iron. I'm Asian with super thick, pin-straight hair that never holds curl for more than a couple of hours. I've tried all kinds of other curling irons and setting sprays but my hair was always back to straight after a little while. Then, over 4 years ago, I bought this Enzo Milano iron after seeing a video review- and it is the only curling iron I will ever use again! It heats up to an EXTREMELY high temperature so you need to use a Kevlar glove (which came with mine) when you use this AND a very good heat protectant spray. I use White Sands Liquid Texture. I wish I could post a picture because this makes my butt-length hair look sooo gorgeous and goddess-like. Everyone asks if my hair is real because it looks so perfect. This iron works so well that the curls last until the next time I wash my hair- which could be 2-3 days! And the spiral curls look beachy and boho- very sexy like Victoria's Secret. I can't live without this curling iron! It's also well made because it has lasted over 4 years and still works perfectly. I highly recommend this iron to anyone who has hair that doesn't hold curl well with any other iron. Just make sure to use a good deep conditioner at least once a week and use a heat protectant spray every time you use it to prevent damage.
B00EDTB82I|3|Mixeg feelings
B000N1ZOYS|1|This is an ok lip balm, but it doesn't really smell like chocolate and it sure as heck doesn't taste like chocolate (or anything really) like it claims. This is sooooo not worth the almost $7 price tag.
B008985OZ6|4|It  is easy to use mix the three together  But works a little slow.
B00BM7SSZE|4|Very cute - looks just like the picture. Classy, delicate, but not cheap. I have yet to stick it in my hair so how well it holds...to be determined.
B00718AE8C|2|MAC Studio Tech is a very good foundation and I have been using it for years on a daily basis. So, I ordered two NC35 without hesitation. But the products I received from Discounts Jungle are counterfeit. I wasn't sure at first why the Discounts Jungle product does not provide the coverage I am used to. So, went out and bought the same product again from a department store and tried the Discounts Jungle product and the department store one side-by-side. Nothing compare.
B007TIM8A6|1|Didnt help at all. For the price i paid for this item, waste of money.
B00X6HIXD0|5|I love it! My hair feels clean and it is not frizzy.  It also fits right into my vegan lifestyle.
B000H30FGY|5|Great product at a price that beats salon pricing big time!
B009LOJ5MA|5|As a middle aged woman one of my concerns is the appearance of my legs and buttocks. I love in Hawaii so when I was offered this cream for the purpose of inspection and my unbiased opinion I jumped on it immediately. The cream has a nice consistency, not too thick but yet not runny at all, it does spread nicely without running and is quickly absorbed . I've been using on my legs and butt and so far I noticed my skin a little less bumpy for the past couple of weeks. I am looking forward to see greater results with more use, it does have a almost unnoticeable smell and I like that the tube stands up on its cap.
B006HT0AK8|4|I don't have any experience with similar products, so I can't offer any points of comparison.  That said, my face certainly feels cleaner after using this and it's not at all damaging or too rough.
B00CUG270S|5|I love it.
B00NO8DT2G|2|This chap stick is not very smooth, feels a bit oily and gritty. Doesn't feel like the quality beeswax lip balm I've had from others
B001EXJUTY|5|product delivered on time and produces results as expected.
B00GM420A6|2|Buyer Beware!!  Products OK.... Marketing and sales practices are NOT RIGHT. Bought trial offer, got slammed with monthly membership at OUTRAGOUS Prices. Call the 1-800-562-9682 # to cancel. You will be onhold for awhile, but once connected,  be firm and to the point. Did reach agreeable terms and got membership cancelled. I should know better.
B004HKWSTU|3|I don't really have foot problems because I wear really good shoes every day and I don't spend much time on my feet. I thought these Yoga Toes looked like a fun way to stretch out my toes and they are really fun. I pop them on when I'm sitting down reading or watching TV. They don't hurt my feet at all. They're pretty easy to put on and take off and the gel material is comfortable. Would I actually recommend them? If you have foot pain, sure, I don't see how these could hurt you.
B00GGLLC7C|5|My scar is nearly gone!
B0055BO4B0|5|Just Calvin Klein. Stunning
B00GCAJ3I2|5|This is my favorite, product!
B0093IQWPW|4|It's a silky thin texture which I personally like in a moisturizer as opposed to the heavier &#34;richer&#34; textures which I perceive as clogging my pores. I thought it odd that it comes without any directions though, not even a description of 'what it does.' Seems peculiar for a company that goes to great explanatory lengths otherwise to explain the potency of its product. So, although I like the way it feels on my skin, I've come to expect a more explicit list of ingredients in my beauty products (these are not even listed on the jar) and an addition of sunscreen as well. SK-II apparently has none. Unless it is meant solely as a night cream -- and again, who knows? ... because there are no instructions -- you are going to require an additional product for day wear and protection. No one is  going to pay this kind of money for a vague beauty cream that doesn't provide us with, at the least, what we expect in a product.  Lastly, I thought this paragraph from an interview with their president says a LOT about how they think as a company: it says absolutely NOTHING about the quality of the cream. It only speak to how they expect to sell it to us: “It really builds on the insight of the consumer believing that skin aging is accelerating, and she's starting to fall behind,” said Joanne Crewes, President Global Prestige. “And so with a superior proposition, what we've got is a superior claim of about 10 days' usage, you can get firmness of 10 years ago. That, backed by solid scientific credentialing and great teamwork, has really enabled us to deliver a great result.”
B00E94J5M2|5|had searched the earth for this color after once using. At last I found it  here. happy. nothing more to say.
B001DBBC84|5|This is a great little razor-it's easy to hold,doesn't take up much room,works great. I wanted to try an electric razor with hopes of switching from the disposable ones because they are so expensive and it's hard to find the ones I needed at the stores in my area. Great product.I have no complaints.
B00K90JVG0|5|This was a Christmas gift for my 16 year old daughter.  She has used it everyday since opening and absolutely loves it.  Looks great on and makes her eye lashes long.
B003ZVYQRY|5|I have been wearing this oil for years.  I absolutely love it!  It is my signature scent.  I may not smell it on myself anymore but anyone who comes near me can smell it and they love it.
B001DKMY9Q|5|Simply a great shaver in all aspects
B00Y2XJRNM|5|Could tell a difference immediately. This moisturizer left my skin feeling so silky and smooth. Not a heavy moisturizer, very light.
B009FIR05Q|4|I had to look for long time about this brush I find it and was $ 3 only. I love it.
B004W8XLAM|5|I love these! I ordered 8 and they are really nice!<br /><br />Many people in the reviews are saying that they received a different one than they ordered, but if you order from E-Discount you will get the exact item in the picture and they ship super fast. I literally had mine the next day.<br /><br />These are great for my shop!
B0075HPJEI|5|Divine
B005GO5C44|5|I received a Colgate Optic White toothbrush, toothpaste, and mouthwash compliments of the Influenster Sugar 'n Spice VoxBox. My mouth has seriously never felt cleaner! The toothbrush is perfectly shaped to fit around my teeth and into the gaps and grooves. I was already using the toothpaste as my main brand, but it never foamed as much when used with my old toothbrush as it does with the Optic White toothbrush. And the mouthwash? I LOVE the mouthwash. Sweet and minty fresh. Why did I stay away from foaming mouthwash all these years? I have no idea because it's awesome!! So thank you Colgate for giving me a brilliant smile. :)
B0006BDRE4|4|I bought this product because of its great price.  So I start using it and it's actually really a good balm.  I don't prefer to use it on my hands or on anyone's butts (like the back of the container suggests) but I do use it on my lips.  And I think it's better than any chapsticks or lip glosses that I've used. <br /> <br />First of all, the container is round enough so that I can stick my lips in it, and put on the balm.  I don't have to use my fingers if I'm on the train or any public place.   <br /> <br />Second of all, the lips get moisturized very well.  Its nothing like other chapsticks where your lips feel that dry stickiness.  This one feels nice, and gets deep down into the lips. <br /> <br />Its very glossy and slippery, and actually looks very nice on the lips.  As I said before the moisturizing is great! <br /> <br />The container is big enough to last a long time. <br /> <br />The only downside is that it doesn't smell something you'd want to eat.  But it does have this pleasant rosy smell that doesn't bother you, and doesn't taste bad. And one thing that doesn't really matter is when it's very cold, it doesn't freeze up, but stiffens a little.
B003POPDMI|5|Girls- always go to bed with some kind of lip balm on to help with putting on any kind of lipstick or stain in the morning!  This is one of the best stains I've ever used and the colors are great!
B00331YTGY|4|Just started using.....so far, I see no lifting action!  I am still hoping.  Maybe I need surgery!!  But I hope this will help
B00A27RI92|5|Excellent products. Wish it was available in a larger size. Feels great and helps the skin not feel dry and is not greasy.
B00766SGE8|4|This color has been compared to MAC Candy Yum Yum but it's about $10 cheaper! Wet N Wild has gorgeous lip colors!!!
B00L4EX7XS|5|Great toner, feels nice on the skin. I have noticed the pores on my face getting smaller.  Natural products are the only products you should use on your skin.  This one is a good choice
B002DPUY42|4|I am one of the few that love the smell of this cream.<br /><br />I also have dry skin and live in a very dry climate, so I crave thicker, richer creams. Funnily enough, compared to a lot of reviewers, I don't find this one to be that oily or rich. When I put it on it sinks right in and almost feels more glycerin based than oil based (I don't have a list of ingredients in front of me so can't verify that; I'm just talking about feel).<br /><br />That being said, a little does seem to go a long way, and while my skin probably could handle something like this during the day, I have a different preferred daily moisturizing lotion and choose to instead use this at night.
B000H0SCCG|5|More than worth the price I paid for it = $15 for 12 ounces, i had paid $24 for the 5 ounces at my local store, when i saw this i couldn't believe the price.  Will definitely be sending the link to my friends.
B003156NL6|4|Works as expected
B0043D7O0E|5|These little packs are just right for in the car, purse, backpack, etc.  In the past I've carried the wipes in plastic containers in my car... the packs that hold 20+ on a roll, but find that no matter how carefully I seal the container they always dry out before I manage to use them all.<br />These individual packs may be a little more expensive, but considering the fact that the lesser expensive packaging means more waste due to dried up wipes.... this makes more sense to me.
B00EAM9DW0|3|I love this wig. Even though the picture is misleading due to the color filter, I still loved the color. It is great for cosplay. The only issue I have with this wig is that it started shedding on the day that I received it in the mail, but it does not shed too much.
B0071E4DXI|4|&#34;Organic Sustainable Sandalwood Essential Oil&#34;<br /><br />No, it has pine tar in it, not sandalwood oil.<br /><br />I have only recently grown a moustache and I have brillo for hair so I need strong hold. This product does hold, at first, but like all organic oil/wax products, it gets absorbed into the hair.  After all, these are the same ingredients found in beard/'stache conditioners.<br /><br />While it is not strong enough to hold a handlebar for long (at least for my steel wool 'stache), it does a pretty good job.  My only complaint is it uses pine tar, not sandalwood, as advertised.  It doesn't stuff me up (many scents do) but smelling &#34;Pine Sol&#34; all day isn't my idea of pleasant.<br /><br />I will probably try another product next time, but really only because I'm not fond of pine tar.
B009Z4RP1Y|3|it just don't smell the same.  I have been using this for 20 yrs,and now not so happy
B00005NFBJ|2|I received the wrong item but my sister had the correct one and it was amazing. This version spells like straight up rubbing alcohol and it burns. Don't use it
B009NNFB0O|4|Product works as advertised
B00022WA7M|3|The idea is wonderful, but the battery doesn't hold up to its end of the bargain - didn't hold a charge very long at all - didn't even get done styling shoulder length hair
B000EMRL4W|5|Love it!!!!
B001KYU78U|5|I have been using this box color for almost two years and haven't looked back. I have medium brown hair and this color takes my hair to the most beautiful platinum blonde! I time it for about an hour once I start the application and it's perfect (as long as I make sure to leave it in long enough). There were a few times when I didn't time it right and ended up with a yellowish tint, which is annoying, but I learned my lesson and pay more attention to the clock. It comes with a conditioning shampoo packet to use after you rinse the bleach out and I ALWAYS do a deep condition after the shampoo. If you don't your hair can be a little brittle and more prone to breakage. If you plan on just doing a root touch up, which is what I do, always make sure you only get the bleach on your roots! If you aren't careful and get it all over your already bleached hair it can, and will, break off. Blondes can have it all as long as you read the directions ;)
B000ELP5KA|5|Smell really good
B0057WKNBW|5|Hols your foundation very good also gets rid of blemish.<br /><br />This powder keeps me shine free for hours with out &#34;caking&#34; up. Love it!<br /><br />I will definitely repurchase this!
B000GDC4IM|5|Works wonders!!! My deep acne marks were totally gone in a month! Definitely recommend to anyone who has trouble with marks
B001DYHK00|4|I like it but it is much more brown than it says or shows. My granddaughter , 2 years old, thought I had chocolate on my fingernails. I will us it . I is good for this time of year. But I was expecting it to be red brown . It is really brown brown with a little burgundy .
B008ADJZ0A|1|I am a huge fan of Aminogenesis. They have some products that are simply amazing. However, this product is probably very old. It has a pretty nasty odor and it's just like applying glue to your face. You try to put your makeup afterwards, and the cream starts peeling of your skin. If the cream touches your eyebrows, you will have to wash your face again!!!
B001B9FFV8|5|This worked much better then my old Goodwell bowl.
B001OVQSJG|1|Package came with shampoo and conditioner leaking everywhere. Then, to make matters worse, neither of the pumps work on the bottles so I have to unscrew the tops each day I'm in the shower to spill alittle into my hand. Not happy about spending $50 on hair product with broken bottles and 1/3 of contents spilled in delivery box.
B000VOLOPK|1|Fragrance bore NO resemblance to the product I have purchased for years.  The bottle was also nothing like the one pictured or one I own, though it bore the name.  product returned
B00KVNIW5Q|5|Great product if you get a chance to try it go ahead it will make you feel a little younger.
B00U7ML6T0|5|Got these for a Mother's Day gift - my mom loved them!!!
B00S1A3Y40|5|I've used the product before I ordered. Same as I expected. Was packaged nice and all in tact. I'm satisfied.
B003PL9PLG|5|Wanted something paraben and sulphite free and came across these products about 4 years ago. Settled on Yes To Tomatoes and have been quite happy and have used it only since then. Mistakenly bought Yes to Carrots and did not like it at all. Too oily for my &#34;Normal Skin&#34; and had to use it at night so as not to waste it but couldn't use it for a day cream. Decided to try the Yes to Cucumbers this week and totally loved it. So much so I am returning the new Yes to Tomatoes bottle I got with it to exchange it for another Cucumber one. I wish I really understood why the reviews diverged so much but my two cents is that I doubt I will be changing from these products at any time soon in the future.
B006K1XA9G|5|I bought this, along with the beautiful full sized perfume for my Mom (who is a cat lover, and also favorites the color purple). She just LOVED it and has been wearing it all the time. The scent is perfect for the young and old, and having this little solid perfume in her wallet has come in handy for just a quick touch up on her scent during the day and night. The scent lasts long, smells a tiny bit musky with floral/fruit notes and is great for a casual dinner with friends, a night on the town with your special someone or even just hanging around the house! It's just a wonderful overall scent, and the locket it comes in is just darling! She loves it and has been showing all her friends. She thinks it is just perfect for her and has been enjoying it very much!! Being the type of girl who always wants to see her Mom smile, this was a perfect gift for the Mommy who has everything! ;)
B000C21096|5|Smells great. I am always complimented on the way i smell. Just one quick spray to the bare chest does the trick.
B00157T2IS|5|Miracle 2. Is a great product. I've used it for years .  However. The plastic bottle was cracked and leaking lotion when I got it ,
B002HQGOUA|5|the best product
B00BPYF6XG|5|Great stuff! Needs to be a permanent item and not limited. I would recommend this lotion to everyone who likes quality.
B000GDA056|5|Great price, great product.  Tones skin well.  Using it with a cleanser, getting great results.  Massage chain charged me 2xprice, so I returned and ordered this.  Using daily for 2 months and not even half used.
B00CSJBHV2|5|Accurate to picture, very soft and really good quality for the price. It gave me about a month's window for it to arrive, and it showed up much before then, so shipping was great.
B0038EWARQ|5|WHY oh why did they discontinue this product??? This was the best smelling shampoo and conditioner line I had ever used in my life, and I'm always switching my shampoo and conditioner. The best part was that the scent would last all day, maybe even two days if I didn't wash my hair daily. It also made my hair extremely shiny and soft. I had so many good hair days using this, it made me feel sexier than any of their underwears ever did. Victoria's Secret finally comes up with a real secret product worth keeping and they decide to discontinue it. This makes me sad.<br /><br />Every so often I write to them asking to bring back this product. It worked one year, and they brought it back temporarily. I suggest everyone who is interested should write to them and ask them to bring this back permanently!
B00GYF65TK|5|I am 64 ! My wrinkles r nonexistent !
B006W2SYHG|4|This shaver does exactly as it says it will.  My boyfriend that has never had an electric shaver is absolutely impressed.  He uses it every day and said he will never go back to regular shaving.  His life has been changed after 42 years!  Thanks Amazon reviewers for steering to the best product out there.
B008ALZAGK|3|Been using for 2 weeks with no problems.  It has a very cheap feel to it.  If you want to try one for yourself, you might purchase it as an add-on item -- certainly don't pay shipping on top of price.  In my opinion, I would never give it as a gift unless it was a instance of needing to purchase a large number of them to give as gifts to a large group of people.<br />UPDATED REVIEW:  After using this a little longer, I would now knock it down to one star.  The zipper started with not staying zipped.  (I have a safety pin securing the key ring.)  The zipper has progressed to tearing away from the leather.
B00D13GS0Y|3|Came 2 days after ordered, loved that! Wasn't quite color I thought but, its OK!
B00F08OL34|5|Absoulutely LOVE this! It is hard to find good Lilac scented body products withour paying an arm & a leg for them. I WILL be buying this again. Not only is the scent wonderful, but foams up so nicely, which, honestly, surprised me. I have used this all summer long!
B00BPDUHI6|5|This is a great product for the price. What I paid for the whole package is what I would have paid for in the salon for one bottle of shampoo! it smells great and makes my hair feel awesome.
B00AFWPVUC|5|I was scared to try this brush because an Amazon reviewer mentioned that the PBT material exposes one to harmful phthalates.  As those were the first group of chemicals I was told essential to avoid given my specific chemical sensitivities & I rapidly feel awful when I use products containing it even in minor doses or when I don't know I'm being exposed, the idea of putting anything in my mouth that could contain it seemed very scary.<br /><br />So I emailed the company (info@mouthwatchers.com) & they were very helpful including in explaining their extensive testing & that they only chose to use PBT as the material because its strength enables the ultra-fine bristles to stay strong & durable so as to enable effective deep cleaning.  They are correct in that the downside I discovered after a few months of using the Nimbus brush which looks similar in design is that the challenge for very fine & soft bristles is how to enable enough cleaning power.  I had no idea that a lot more plaque than usual was accumulating during this time till my hygienist asked me what I had been doing differently.  As that cleaning was extra rough to go through, it motivated me to make sure I use the most effective brushes possible while staying soft & gentle as my dentist explained it's repeated micro-rotations that result in effective cleaning & not the pressure which is why they're always urging we stay with soft brushes.<br /><br />Because of my concerns, Mouth Watchers was kind enough to send me a free brush to try out & I WAS SO VERY GRATEFUL TO DISCOVER THIS IDEAL BRUSH TO ALTERNATE WITH MY OTHER #1 BRUSH (the SoFresh flossing brush) AS I FIND THEY'RE EACH UNIQUELY DESIGNED TO BRING EXTRA BENEFITS THAT I MISS IF I USE JUST ONE OR THE OTHER.<br /><br />& I'M THRILLED TO REPORT THAT MY CHEMICAL SENSITIVITIES WERE IN NO WAY AFFECTED BY MY NOW USING THIS MOUTHWATCHERS BRUSH DAILY as I'm so sensitive that I can rapidly tell if I'm being exposed to anything harmful vs. beneficial as my symptoms rapidly worsen until I figure out & stop whatever's causing the problem.<br /><br />So because they use PBT which is a a stronger material enabling extra benefits, IT'S IMPORTANT TO BRUSH GENTLY & BUILD UP GRADUALLY as most people exert too much pressure when brushing & that is bad for one's gums & needlessly wears down the enamel on one's teeth.  This stronger material this brush uses makes it more durable & enables ultra fine bristles that enable deeper cleaning at the gum line which is important.  That is why it can initially seem to aggravate sensitivity or create some soreness but that should go away within a week or so as it's simply that any area that was previously covered by plaque will be more sensitive when first exposed but should rapidly adjust.  SO ANY INITIALLY INCREASED SENSITIVITY/SORENESS COULD BE A GOOD SIGN IN that it indicates that long-standing plaque that is finally getting dislodged & from then on prevented from accumulating.  As plaque causes gum recession & can cause gum disease &/or cavities & even impacts one's health, it's well worth making sure it's not left to build up.<br /><br />NOTE THAT I PURPOSELY WAITED TILL I HAD BEEN USING THIS BRUSH FOR 1 MONTH BEFORE WRITING A REVIEW SO I COULD MAKE SURE THAT the various problems some other reviewers mentioned including with bristles falling out were not an issue.  The company seems very thorough & responsive so I would imagine they would be pleased to issue a replacement or help figure out what might be causing any problem as the way I found their email address is a company rep included it in her reply to somebody who had problems with another brush of theirs.toms rapidly worsen until I figure out & stop whatever's causing the problem.<br /><br />So because they use PBT which is a a stronger material enabling extra benefits, IT'S IMPORTANT TO BRUSH GENTLY & BUILD UP GRADUALLY as most people exert too much pressure when brushing & that is bad for one's gums & needlessly wears down the enamel on one's teeth.

B000CKFQ2K|5|If you want a product that goes a long way with little use, try this. You will not be disappointed.
B009OY8398|5|I'm loving it and will get me other shades as soon as possible :D
B0045CE0S2|1|The seals on the packages of the needles are all opened and not sterile
B000R00CC4|3|I ran out of deodorant while in Germany earlier this year, so I bought the stick version of Rexona Cobalt Blue and really liked it.  I bought the roll on version once I was back in the states, but it doesn't smell quite the same and I don'l like it as much as the stick.
B001CJJ5RM|1|The smell of this serum is terrible, it looks like expired while ago.  I hAve tried to use it for 2 days but it remains even in my hands<br />Im going to try to return it. Also the color is really a dark orange nothing like this serum at all
B00JPKE1BK|1|I bought this at Wal-Mart. I followed the directions to the letter. I applied two coats for better coverage as directed in instructions. Within 4 hours the polish just peeled off 6 of my nails.<br />What a waste of money.
B0030ZRSHK|5|My skin is so sensitive and this wax works wonders!! No funky smell and goes on smooth.  Put a little baby powder on before using and it comes off with no problem.  Does a great job removing hair and has yet to burn at all.
B000BBF4KO|5|Best trimmers ever
B0037MH6L4|2|Not so great.
B004QRX6U4|5|Perfect travel size or as a way to test this excellent UD product. I play roller derby and this makes my makeup last through entire bouts (and crazy afterparties). It feels super light while on and I use the full size version daily.
B001ET7E82|5|I don't use lotion much actually next to never, but this stuff was brought to my attention by a female she recommended this as a after shave lotion. And man no homo  it works great it's feels soothing and I get compliments all the time for a smooth face and the fragrance. You jus gotta try it man.
B004I94DF2|2|Very thick and difficult to apply.
B0012RV5UO|5|It came right away & abosolutely love the scent.!
B000WKY5KE|5|Best top coat
B002HSM6BO|4|I like it, it takes me back to that old school barber smell! However, the powder tends to get caught in the cap after use. This leads to powder falling out as the bottle is moved around even while the cap is closed. This to me is a minor irritant.
B000C1W6P4|5|a hidden gem!  Love it!
B00FGAHZ02|5|i love it  thank you so much never used this product before i would buy it again keep  it in stock .  :)
B00CPT8HF4|3|Didn't notice a difference in quality per say, however Very foul odor from this stuff.
B003IEOIB2|1|This body talc is a great value, but the sandalwood fragrance is much too strong for my tastes. If you like patchouli, this might be for you.
B009P3DJZG|5|The scent is soothing, seductive, but not at all overwhelming. Can definitely be used with scented lotion or perfume. Feels amazing. I use it after a shower before I towel off and my skin stays soft and smooth.
B004Z209HS|5|I had a face lift by a plastic surgeon for one reason to fix my jaws. He tried twice but failed .  This Doctor was on TV all the time suppose to be a<br />great surgeon. All he did was take my money but no improvement to my jaws. He just wanted more money to try again.  No way, the money I saved before  I retired for this type surgery is gone, that's it. Lesson learned the hard way.  I am 67 years old I ordered purad'or  because my daughter was looking for a product for me and for her. We both ordered this one. I have use it for a week and cannot believe how well it works on my face. I would put it on top of my hands and put on my face to see if it improved my hands which is wrinkled and it did. My jaws have improved on how they look and the rest of my face! I have tried a lot of products this one so far is the best of them all. I hope to write another review after a few months of using<br />this product. I am excited! Please send my another bottle for my review about this product because its working.  Thank You!
B0002G214U|5|Its good
B003CTU5MO|3|I like it but don't use it often.
B00A3DHSMM|2|I have been using tarte oils for over two years andi can say this is nothing like it in face I think this oil maybe fake not real maracuja. This made my face oily and didn't even hydrate it! Don't buy I use it for my hair not and its ok for the hair not great!!!
B00IEY8F9C|4|Big bottle lasts a while does help with frizz. Smell could be better but it is not too bad. Price and the amount you get is great.
B003UKKHB4|4|Hi everybody,<br /><br />This thing is fantastic but be aware you'll need some time to get used to it if you're a first timer in this kind of electric toothbrush.<br /><br />I have had many models of the Oral-b/Braun german electric toothbrushes and this is by far the most practical to use, basically because it has three programs: daily cleaning, whitening and the sensitive. You can choose between them by pressing the only button once, twice or three times being the first one the standard daily cleaning, fi you press twice you'll get the sensitive (never tried this one) and if you press it three times you'll get the whitening mode.<br /><br />The toothbrush came with a very good standard brush head but i fitted with a whitening toothbrush head i had still unused from my previous one. I can say that I like to use it with both brushes. One for daily and the other one for whitening.<br /><br />Another feature it has is that it tells you when to switch the part of your mouth you're brushing. You have to divide your teeth in four and brush each quarter for 30 seconds, then the brush will stop for a fraction of a second and then start again just to tell you to switch to the other quarter. Once finished it will stop-and-go some times indicating that the 2 minutes period for the whole mouth has finished.<br /><br />The brush has a pressure indicator, push too hard and the red indicator will glow. This is particularly useful not only to not harm yourself but also to make brushes heads last longer. This is the first Braun/Oral-b brush I've had with all this features but I can tell you, I love this features. While it has no screen like other models, I don't want to fix a battery eater anywhere in my bathroom so I'm not missing this feature from other more expensive brushes from Oral-b.<br /><br />This review is after moths of daily use. This kind of brushes tends to fail because of the battery but this one it's getting older and even after some accidental drops, keeps looking and working like new.<br /><br />If you want to experiment a higher level of cleanliness and whiling to adapt to this new way to achieve it, just do it. Buy one and enjoy for months to come of your like new mouth feeling everyday. I really recommend it.<br /><br />Basically, this is a tool i just can't live without.<br /><br />I also recommend the [[ASIN:B0037LKO46 Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Toothpaste, Radiant Mint 5.8 oz (164 g)]] with the [[ASIN:B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]] for better whitening results.<br /><br />Been using this toothbrush since august 2010.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.nt a higher level of cleanliness and whiling to adapt to this new way to achieve it, just do it.

B004OH74YK|5|I tend to get dry skin in the summer, but this takes care of that.  I use it with the shower gel and love the resulting scent.  Not too heavy and lasts all day.
B001M3ELG8|5|Nice big brush.  Very soft on the face.  I would recommend.
B00CCG7UQC|5|These scissors were amazing because they cut so well, and quietly, and they don't hurt my fingers.  Never had scissors like this!
B00OTLOHY6|5|I purchased this brush for my wife. She likes it very much and this brush match her long hair very well. And, the delivery is very fast.
B00R6XHWH8|5|This stuff is AWESOME! I ordered  two more since my first order.  It does exactly what it says I have beautiful  lashes now way better than YOUNIQUE  Mascara.  For sure.
B00D5X17FQ|5|The sweetest little barrette. So excellent in quality and material.
B00E3XQ8RE|1|ok .. have used over one month now.. spray nozzle VERY tricky, works only at full open..no variable control... cleaning is a must every use, alcohol helps.. but very time consuming..make up breaks out my skin and itches ..what is in it?? no list on makeup of contents, one page xeroxed instructions, no make up contents via the awful website, call and you get an machine.. with no return call.. Is this a real company?????? my experience says maybe not!  I would advise staying away from this &#34; professional&#34; rip-off.
B005UBN3L2|2|I don't like this product and would love to send it back but I've already used it.  The shades are much darker than pictured.
B000PI13SU|5|Just wondertul!
B00196Y09G|5|Great product.... excellent
B000VV0IDW|5|This black sphere is absolutely beautiful on my alter.  Already used it to skry.  It is a perfect size, 80 mm is about three inches but it's dark facade makes it seem much bigger.  it also comes on a beautiful wooden stand with padding for the ball to rest on.
B0017OJ2F2|5|My husband loves this particular bod and I cannot get it in the store any longer.  I very excited that you still carry it.  It is always a special surprise for him when he sees that gold bottle!
B0091THQ4E|5|Quality of product was as expected. Expiration dates were well within ability to use product safely over time.  Product arrive intact and ahead of promised time.
B0073FVT32|5|Makes my hair feel soft and shiny.  Not crazy about the scent, but not a deal breaker.  I personally don't like flowery scents.
B008HODSNW|5|wonderful price and can cut to suit your needs
B00C85KI5C|5|Good to go.
B00115CFC4|5|This is a very good product. It evens out the skin and covers imperfections. Your legs actually can be beautiful without stockings.
B000FEIOHW|1|Broke after about six weeks, didn't even last long enough to need to replace the batteries.<br /><br />I'm not someone that breaks things. I've had the same DVD player and TV for 12 years, keep my cars for 120k + miles, have never broken a cellphone etc. I take care of things. I used this toothbrush, and stood it up on the counter when I was done. After six weeks it stopped working. Not okay<br /><br />I really liked it a lot when it worked. It got my teeth clean, once I got used to it. I'm not sure what I'm going to do now. It seems lame to give a company who made a defective product more money, by buying a better model. It is a hassle to try and return it....<br /><br />I get really tired of companies who knowingly manufacture junk.<br />I'm sure after a few weeks, when the complaints started rolling in, Phillips knew this toothbrush didn't work very long. Why didn't they stop manufacturing it? Of course because they thought they could make money. Well, my dentist recommended it, and I'm going to tell him that these toothbrushes are junk. I'll see if there is another brand of electric toothbrush I can buy.
B003K2D49Y|2|Doesn't work as god as I thought it would
B00408EUJA|5|Great product!
B000UR90OK|5|Perfect!
B003SRFD04|1|It was dried out and colors were not matte as the description says,  I returned it and never got a refund.
B005ST4DOC|5|Well what can i say .. i love buying from this seller .. they ship it right away and everything i do recommend this for other people that want to buy the Corium 21 Aloe Vera Skin Cream ... its awesome ! .. thanks
B004R7P95S|2|It is good on eye shadow and concealer, but useless for waterproof mascara. Also, it does not remove eyeliner easily. Would not recommend at all.
B000NJJBH6|5|I absolutely love traveling with this product.  Holds quite a bit and makes it VERY easy to see what one is looking for.  Use it for personal care products, medications, and small items one doesn't waste time looking throught suitcase for.  Highly recommend. Also use it quite often when out and about with grandkids for all the things small kids need taken with them on outings.
B000B3KDU8|1|Item description: 0.06 0z. Eau de Toilette Sampler Vial SPRAY, which means for 10.99$, (supposedly reduced from over 30$0...), you are buying  a tiny sampler (Free sample, not for sale is printed on the accompanying packaging), it`s not a spray either and the one I received was half empty.  It is the sample you get free at any department store- 0.06 oz. is really a sampler (when it`s full).
B009DU4QYE|4|Purchased this for my husband who has very oily hair and itchy scalp.  He's tried a variety of product over the years and has only partial success from them. (I'm writing because I'm the one whole does this &#34;kind of thing&#34;.)<br />He's nearing the end of his first bottle (purchased the end of Oct.)  He washes his hair daily, so he's had plenty of time to evaluate it.<br />He is very pleased with this shampoo. So much so that I re-ordered today - in fact I ordered two. It has a clean, herbal scent. Note: It should be shaken before use.<br />Thank you for an excellent product.  I plan to purchase other products from the manufacturer.
B002Y2M18Q|2|I have had this flat iron for less tban 4 months and it has already stopped working, won't heat up at all.
B0009DT39C|5|I really like this . I use it for my eyebrows. This is the second one that I have bought. The first one I broke when I dropped it. They are fragile so be careful.
B000JL7WQK|5|I love the scent of this perfume. This is my new signature scent! It has a warm sweet and sort of chocolatey scent with a hint of florals. It also arrived fast and in perfect condition. I will definitely repurchase in the future...
B00LX1332W|5|Cute and very affordable. Just what I was wanting.  Wish there was quicker shipping and tracking though.
B004E4GHRS|5|I bought this for my daughter skin and it clear it up but you have to use it everyday. It's good
B009SCRSHE|5|I love JWoww and Snookie. Born in NY and near Nicole's hometown (Pleasant Valley for me), I love this lotion and cannot wait to tan darker and bring my Italian side out!
B0020MMD0G|5|Vey good perfume, fast shipment !!
B000Y04QUG|5|Love the color and dekivery was great!
B001DNZJYU|1|This is awful! such poor quality I had never seen, first,texture of the water, in the second heterogeneous mass, and third, by the bottle once it was clear that this shoddy.I am very very disappointed in the future will be cautious with purchases from this site. Don't buy this product, otherwise dispose of money.
B008U1Q4DI|5|love it! exactly what i expected and more
B000C1Z4V2|3|Lovely scent! I usually use the regular Red Door scent but decided to try this one because of all the good reviews. I do like it, its a lighter, more fruity & flowery scent than the regular Red Door. My only complaint is that it doesn't last long, the scent fades rather quickly, other than that, its very nice.
B00I50OIDM|5|excellent
B00876T3W0|4|Nice. Some little bows were broken but that's expected when you buy so cheap and from another country. There was a good amount of each but would have liked a little more black. Still really nice and fun
B0078PXR1O|5|Very good product at a good price.
B0014P8L9W|4|very good facepack
B004SO2SVI|4|No one has literally thrown themselves at me since I started using this stuff, but I've worn it out a couple of times and it seems to make a definite difference in everyday interactions. I usually try it before things like job interviews, work social events, etc., and it seems to have a net positive effect.
B00009RB1C|5|I first purchased my Norelco Razor in 1988. I have used Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads for the razor two times. The Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads fits my razor.
B000F63TW0|5|i only used this twice a week for two weeks before buying a chemical peel which i was more interested in seeing if it worked so the oil of olay has kind of fallen by the wayside but for the time i did use it it felt nice and smelt good. was a bit pricey though.
B003LELOYS|5|For travel size or to donate.  Great price.  If you travel a lot this is great.....much better than hotel soap.
B00N29EXBS|5|This is exactly what my mom wanted for Christmas.
B001H940AE|5|I have been using this lipstick for over 10 years and I just love it. True to color. I did receive this item right of way.
B00AE07EE6|5|I've been using this for about a year now, doesn't require very much, smells very good and doesn't seem to dry my hair out at all, highly recommended.
B0081JSSWE|4|I've always wanted to try the perfume but it's a little pricey so I saw it in a roll on and I just love it's great and it partisan going to be getting more and it was deliver fast so all in all it was a great buy.
B0042GSHEY|4|The head is turned up more than it looks in  the picture. Doesnt look as friendly. He is huggable though.
B00L5DI5K8|1|Don't believe the good reviews for this curler. First, the product I received was not made by the stated manufacturer, but instead was produced by a company called &#34;zlime.&#34; I figured, well, okay, that doesn't mean that it doesn't work, right? I turned it on, heated it up, curled the lashes of one eye, and ... nothing. Absolutely nothing. I did it again. Then I repeated it once more, just to be sure. I finally called my husband into the room. He stared at my one (allegedly) curled eye and said, &#34;I don't get it.&#34; So there you have it - different product/manufacturer, zero effect, confused husband. I wish that I had set fire to my money instead, it would have at least been more entertaining.
B003RD7BTA|5|Great pigmentation, great colors, long lasting!!! Just love it! Great cream eyeshadow! Love it love it love it love it
B00GHUHJGK|3|Not really serviceable. Takes too long to use.
B0079WQH5Y|5|good tape
B00D8ZOVIQ|5|Prompt delivery! Great gift for family members!
B004OT29MA|5|I TRY OTHER BRANDS AND ALWAYS COME BACK TO FULL AND SOFT. I HATE CLUMPY AND FLAKEY, THICK, CHUNKY STUFF, ADD THE PRICE,  AND YOU CAN BUY 2 TO 6 OF THESE FOR THE COST OF SOME FANCY NAME BRANDS THAT LEAVE ME BROKE AND DISAPPOINTED.
B004CLUMKQ|5|Best product on the market for ingrown hairs
B0014K8SMW|5|I LOVE Love Potion®: Cougar Potion. I think it smells very yummy. The scent is not too heavy or overpowering, but it also seems to last well. When I wear it I feel especially sexy and confident. I have gotten a lot of compliments, more attention from men in general, and got a particularly positive reaction from my boyfriend. He happens to be quite a bit younger than I am so I guess that makes me a &#34;Cougar&#34;. Of course he was already attracted to me before I started using Cougar Potion, but this did add some extra pizzaz. The first time I wore this scent around him he went on and on about how good I smelled, he was particularly attentive... and the attention continues.  I have tried other pheromone infused perfumes before, but this one is my all time favorite. I would most definitely buy Cougar Potion again.
B00MS41GFO|5|Want a beauty secret?  Curl your eyelashes!!  I really liked the Beauty Lashious Eyelash curler!  It makes my eyes look Fabulicious!<br /><br />I had been using the same eyelash curler for years, and needed replacement pads when I happened upon these.  Boy, am I glad I did.  I was intrigued by the handles.  These are unlike any handle I have seen on any other eyelash curler.  The ones I have had have always had that scissor like handle that when you squeeze your lashes, you wind up squeezing and hurting your fingers as well.<br /><br />The first thing I loved, right from the box, is the color!  I am a girly girl and having this pink handled eyelash curler is just perfectly feminine!  LOVE IT!!  Impulseev Eyelash Curler has a uniquely shaped handle that is really comfortable on your hands.  When you squeeze your lashes, you no longer trap your fingers in the scissor like handle.<br /><br />I apply my cream, foundation and setting powder, then I start on my eyes!  I have straight eyelashes of average length.  After applying my eye make-up minus the mascara, I carefully squeeze this curler around my eyelashes.  It was a perfect fit, capturing all my lashes with no pinching.  I squeezed for about 10 seconds, released and squeezed another 10 seconds.  The curl on my lashes was very noticeable!  They looked much fuller.  Putting on mascara revealed a dramatic look to my eyes!<br /><br />The curler itself is well made.  The plastic handle is really unique and comfortable.  The pads seem to be softer and more bouncy and the curler does not pull or pinch my lashes.  I'm really happy with this curler.  I'm really glad I found it.  I've recommended it to all my friends and family, it is that good!<br /><br />Disclaimer - I received this item for my honest and unbiased review.  All opinions are my own based on personal experience.
B000X2W6LQ|5|This was a gift for my daughter, she loves it. No more bending down to use a mirror & being able to see the back of her head is a bonus.
B00008DQJP|1|Absolutely junk, will not buy anything from Braun the rest of my life. It simply does not shave right and it turns shaving in a torture session. I tried to work with Braun expecting maybe a mal function as it is hard to believe this device can be so bad but they just make you run in circles from one service center to another. So besides a crap product also terribe customer service. Save your money and buy a Norelco.
B000S18AJY|1|This flat iron is poorly designed.  The temperature control button is located in the exact place you hold the iron and so it is way too easy to accidentally change the temperature setting.  The controls should be on the inside of the handle or somewhere else to avoid hitting them every time the iron is picked up.
B005XUNG5I|5|Love this product!  I had dry, cracked skin on my heels and this took care of it in the first use.  I took off 10 years of dry skin in 10 minutes.  Highly recommend it!
B003K75V72|5|As it says in the name it is nourishing. My skin gets very very dry in the summer and winter time and this body cream keeps my skin smooth and nourished. I put it on right after my shower and my skin is soft throughout the day. It smells amazing as well.
B00DR8UYQW|4|A very soft brush that is perfect on your skin, and did arrive as promised.
B00846HDH0|5|Because I was very satisfied with the product even came in a timely manner. It's the actual product I was looking for. One Negative thing I do have to say and it's not really negative but it could use a better container to ship it in really not a big deal the product speaks for itself
B00HZHKTEI|1|don't know why people are saying this so so great and pigmented. i was seriously disappointed.
B004HEC9J0|5|The color is more red than it is in the picture. This is was my first OPI polish purchase my freshman year in college and I always go back to it for the holidays. It's such a great holiday color!
B0027A7CLG|5|I have some hyperpigmentation on my face (melmasma from pregnancy) and I can never find anything that will cover without looking cakey.  This BB cream covers so nice and it's buildable without being cakey or noticable.  I set it with a translucent powder and I'm good for the day.  I bought #23 and was worried because it has a grey color to it but it adjusted to my skin tone perfect.
B001GCVJHE|5|I found these a few years ago and now they cannot be found in stores. IMy husband loves these wipes.
B0083AKG58|5|I just took a bath with this and like OMG my whole body and face is glowing, it's smooth, and it's soooo soft, I feel so beautiful lol :) :) :)
B00IQLHINW|4|Smells great, not too overwhelming
B00FRDPPRS|4|I like it. It's a little more expensive than I usually pay for but I feel like it gives my hair a bit more volume.
B0059NL39U|5|I have oily skin meaning that for me make up and pimples is like cereal and milk, and this has been helping me a lot with my troubled skin.  I started seeing it right away.  I tried to not wear make up unless there was a party from the family, if not my face would be all full with pimples, but thanks to this I can wear make up everyday and my face looks healthy.  I give a big hurray to Holika Holika Pore Clearing Petit BB Cream ^_^
B0018HPFJK|5|I bought this due to the positive reviews over at Makeup Alley website. I have used other MAC lipsticks, but I generally find the matte ones are too drying and flat. This one is not matte (a plus, I think).<br /><br />PLUMFUL is a lovely medium (not too dark, not to light or bright) plummy pink shade that looks darker in the tube but takes on a nice pink-leaning plummy tone on the lips. It's a good, brightening daytime color for when you wear outfits that are in the cooler browns, plums, purples and pinks. I find that it pairs fabulously with MAC's Jampacked lipglass (which, sadly, is a sold out limited edition) and with Black Honey lip gloss by Clinique. These combos work amazingly with the new fall purple colors of fashion.<br /><br />I have a medium-dark Latina coloring (NC 44 in MAC color tones), and this goes well on my skin tone. But others have raved who are lighter and darker than me, so this color is flexible and widely-flattering.<br /><br />It also has a nice whitening effect on the teeth, for those who care about that. :)<br /><br />I just ordered EAGER from the MAC website, and I hope that one is at least as nice--or nicer--than PLUMFUL, which I intend to have as a staple in my makeup bag.<br /><br />Mir
B00IDWP4IA|4|My skin is softer.  I do like the serum.  I have not noticed any reduction in my wrinkles since using it. Maybe that is not what it is for but I do like the softness of my face.
B00ARF42H0|5|excellent choice, works very well, good price too
B0036FTE5I|5|Good stuff!
B00TGJQC3K|5|Such a stunning palette - loving the colors and the blush too :) another win from Tarte
B00I6LIC0U|3|I bought this. It came from Greece, arrived promptly, and was in a glass bottle with glass stopper, nice. But contrary to what was stated, it smells strongly of olive oil. there is a faint scent of herbs, but mostly olive oil. Since I got it for the scent, not varicose veins, it is useless to me.
B006W2SYF8|5|Gives a nice, smooth shave
B001I6S0ZW|5|What can I say? Non-toxic ingredients, no animal testing and no funny taste/smell! A bit pricey, but soooo worth it : )
B00S0QJY9O|5|I REVIEWED THE BLACK BAMBOO CHARCOAL SPONGE, that was listed on this product page.  I am assuming it is out of stock and the seller will be bringing it back soon.  But please don't neg me because this review is appearing on the white sponge page.  There is no where else to re-post this review at this time.  If I was offered this white sponge--I would grab it in a heartbeat.  If I like the black one so much, I know I'd like the white, too.<br /><br />I had no idea something like this existed. But when I saw it for the first time last week, I knew I had to have it.<br /><br />I stumbled upon Biore charcoal products maybe six months ago, and soon realized that charcoal was really helping my skin. All my life I limped along using many different products. They &#34;kind of&#34; worked, if you know what I mean. Then came charcoal products, and I really saw a difference.<br /><br />So this bamboo charcoal sponge: What an interesting substance! It is hard in the plastic bag it comes in. You need to water it. It turns into a pliable sponge-y mass. It is stimulating on its own. But it is a wonderful carrier for my charcoal facial cleansers.<br /><br />I am excited about this sponge. It is unique and a pleasure to use. I test a lot of products; this one is a real keeper. And I think they've got me hooked on it....<br /><br />*I received a sample product from TNG.
B008S6INZC|5|Get extremely hot
B0081Z86ZC|5|I love this product. I just began self servicing my manicures at home and I noticed that dust would build up every where. I tried this unit and it is awesome I have  noticed minimum dust build up and I have not had to use my vacuum after nail applications. The bag is washable so please do not throw the bag out. Empty the dust into a trash bag and let the bag soak in washing detergent and air dry then reuse. Since I only service my nails I can go almost two months before I change the bag.
B00132TISE|5|This completely does what it says! I read the reviews & wondered but bought anyway.  My hair type is medium coarse & I currently own a CHI - this works better than my CHI because of the shine & now my hair is silkly.  In fact, it was too straight! I cut my hair (wish I hadn't now) so my long hair would have been super.  Tried w/day old dry hair & thought, if it didn't work, I'd wash/condition it and start again. Didn't have to -you'd think I had done my daily routine or come from a hairdressers!!!  Highly recommend to all - just make sure you know how to use a straightener - don't listen to bad reviews unless they tell you hair type, and experience w/straighteners. Cons-yes the water reserve does empty fast, but if you're a mom or multi-tasker in the mornings like me, no worries. Unplug, pop out, refill, check on the kids/feed the dog, come back, pop back in and finish up.  AND this is day one - I'll write another in 2wks.
B000068PBT|5|Worked well.
B000C1VWAE|5|A gift to a mother b*day makes such a great gift.. and is a whole lot cheaper then buying it from the stores..
B005J34G8A|3|This Brush is just OK it has a good design but the handle is too slick and you will have trouble holding it while scrubing your back. It will turn in your hand and make it hard to use.
B0036BI56G|5|I saw this product on you tube, Hot and Flashy. Tried it and liked it. I would highly recommend this product. I use it every day twice a day.
B000GGJCDY|5|Everyone in my family uses it and will continue using it.
B000VY2ZAI|5|love this shampoo!  i've been using it for 10+ years and i'm sure i'm suppose to switch it up, but NOTHING helps detangle like the keracare. it's especially helpful on black hair that is natural (not permed/straightened).  i'm a 3c/4a and my curls get shoestring knots like crazy.  i used to lose at least a handful of hair during my detangle/comb/finger out process.  once i started using this, it cut that amount down by over half.
B000VVT94G|5|Clippers are great.  The price, additional blades. and the guard make the clippers a great bargain.  I would recommend them without reservation.
B0090UJFYI|5|This product enhances your regular moisturizer. When I use I apply a few drops and mix my regular moisturizer and pat all over. Don't use too much or it takes a while to soak in, but you will be able to tell after the first couple of times what amount works best for you. Leaves your skin more plumped than moisturizer by itself.
B004DBVQ14|5|This body wash alleviated my issue of dry skin during the cold winter months.
B0068MNM2M|5|Good looking product it works well have not used yet. Good quality.
B00HFQQ0VU|5|VERY GOOD~
B000VQZHKG|5|Just what I needed - I broke my original one and this is just right.  I give it a great rating!
B002N5MHLU|5|always used razors to shave in the past this Panasonic  Electric shaver is great does an excellent job.
B002RL8IXG|5|A very good product, in three days I saw de effect in my skin
B007WL2UL2|5|Beautiful an delicated, easy to use and i recive so soon
B00FLUD0TM|5|This set is fantastic...it's hard to pick my favorite.  They are light and very moisturizing - I'd highly recommend them.
B000EGIEOE|4|Bought this item because i was first starting out using a straight razor so i knew i was going to get a few cuts. These stpooed the bleeding right away!
B00MHZ8BBQ|5|Only thing that worked to secure Girl Scout badges!
B00TB8Z6YW|2|I bought this product for a close friend who has trouble finding a good style for her long locks. It promised a step by step guide in the description. Guess what no step by step guide!
B000H0W34O|5|I bought this gift set for my mother in law for Christmas and she is enjoying it. I had a hard time finding this in the stores so I was happy to find it here.
B005ML1U24|5|A staple product for me. I've used it when I was relaxed and when natural and it worked like a charm each time!
B003981CWA|1|The cord only swivels when you force it, it's constantly tangling up to the point where you have to unwravel it in order to use it properly. The heat settings aren't true to temp. 450 feels more like 300.
B000068PBT|5|I forgot how easy it is to shave with sharp blades.  I will replace them much sooner than I had previously.
B004XC84Y0|3|The hair tangled a lot faster than I would have liked.  It was ok  and it did last for a while but not as long as the packs that I purchased in chicago in the same style color and brand!
B00QL89MRW|5|On my second bottle of this product. REALLY love it. My 61 year old skin is soft and smooth.
B0012RXAF2|5|Love this stuff!
B00373DIYM|3|My item was dented and the box was smashed when I got it. Other then that, it is a great product.
B00C8WC47A|5|Cook a lot with different herbs and spices.  Different smells get in pores of skin and help get them out.  Love it.
B00TUE9GWK|5|So fun and cute! I got asked questions if they were real!
B00G5L867C|5|My five year old grandson asked for an electric toothbrush for his 5th birthday. The true test - two months later his parents report he is still faithfully using. The toothbrush times the amount of time to brush each area of the mouth; so many seconds to start and then increasing as the child gets older.
B00G7U19LG|5|Ordered this travel kit for when I go out of town for the holidays. I was impressed by the appearance and the packaging. I ordered this skin care kit  because of the natural ingredients.  I have to say after my trip to Ohio my skin feels great. Normally my face during the winter is very dry, but after using the moisturizer and  anti wrinkle cream my face feels less dry. I will definitely purchase again. I like the convenience of the small sizes and the price for these products.
B00BDTDSPQ|1|It's okay I guess not sure this was what I was looking for
B007HU56GE|5|I love it! It's easy to apply and doesn't look cakey. My face has an oily T-zone, and this helps a lot. There is still some shine a couple hours later, but it is greatly reduced. I will buy this again!
B005V67FLK|5|The scent is great. ! I feel like I'm rejuvenating myself in the shower. My hair is definitely fuller looking. Sulfite free always made me feel like I'd lost all the body in my hair.
B0070Z6D6S|5|Great product for teeth care.
B003Z4SH9E|4|I use it after every shower. Not really impressed yet. But the ingredients seem to be better and at least  less harmless than the other body lotions.
B0017JYA9K|5|Great price, received it very fast, and the smell of this hairspray is very nice.  I use it everyday and it holds for a long period!
B000G1EQ1W|5|I have sensitive skin on my face, and I have gotten tired of my electric shavers leaving my skin red and irritated! I had heard many good things about Braun shavers before I started looking for a new one. In the process of doing research, this shaver came up as being considered best in class by the reviewer that I read. I began looking into how much it would cost. I also read reviews like this one to see what other people thought of it. It sounded good, so I bought it.   I do not regret that decision!! Yes, it was a bit more expensive than my last shaver, but unlike my last shaver, I am not in pain when I finish and I don't have embarrasing red splotches on my face and neck! This shaver is without a doubt the most comfortable shaver I have ever used! It also gives me a closer cut than any other electric shaver I have used. I don't believe it is possible for an electric to cut as close as a razor, but for those of us who can't use them, this is as good as it gets! Even my wife commented on how smooth my skin was after a shave!  The cleaning system that comes with the shaver is nice. I was a bit skeptical about it when I first read about it, but after using it for over a month, I believe it really is doing what it's supposed to. I opened up my shaver after a cleaning cycle just to see if it's really getting the clippings out. It is! I have read other reviews that say the cleaning solution doesn't last very long. I've been using it over a month and it is still going strong. One thing I recommend doing to help extend the life of the solution is to clean it only every other day (or even more if you like). This seems to be extending the life of my cleaning solution. The only downside to the cleaner is that it takes up a fair bit of the counter space on my smallish bathroom counter. Not a problem if you have a large counter top, but something to consider if yours is small like mine.  All in all, I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone, especially if you have sensitive skin or if you are tired of not receiving the closest shave possible!
B00I1K0PZG|5|Fast delivery, very well sealed and packaged! I am making my own Vape sauce and it is working for me well. I'm running the IPV MINI with the Atlantis sub ohm tank on it. My juice is filling my entire house with smoke it so so much. Thanks for a great product at a great price. Companies like this are the reason i shop on Amazon.
B0009ET8PK|5|So glad I found this product, I recommend it to anyone looking for an all natural hair conditioning product.  Thank you.
B00CTYIMQE|5|my husband has had blackheads around his eyes for ever he says they are disappearing so thank you we will buy more if we have to
B000BUW8WM|2|Folks i have been trying to find a razor that will give me the closest possible shave without all the skin irratation. I thought this was it , but no, the fusion is bulky compared to the Mach 3 the razor on the back is not very sharp/strong and hard to clean it is smoother when u shave but thats about the only difference no closer than the mach 3 i still have to go against the grain to get a smooth close shave . I understand that not everyones face is the same but i have been unable to find a razor that will give me a close shave without going against the grain not even th 5 blade fusion. Cotaray to popular belief the closest and most comfortable shave i have been able to get is from an electric razor the Braun Actviator.So there u have it other than the new fancy look theres really not much difference or advantage over the Mach 3.
B003F0XKSG|5|love the toner. it smells good but a very weak smell .it works great on my face .it is putting some natural color back. thanks
B0074PJBEU|5|Love the Lipstain.  It is really worth the cost.  I dont &#34;follow the rules&#34; with all the steps.  I use the stain, the gloss is ok- but I prefer my normal old chap stick over it.<br /><br />Works like they claim- color stays, and it lasts all day for me.
B00016XJ4M|5|Very refreshing. My skin always feels nice and hydrated.
B00BLDCXOQ|5|This mask works with my skin beautifully. It's very similar to glam glow mud mask. My skin is very sensitive but this mask did not irritate my skin at all! The only thing is that you need to be very careful not to leave the mask for too long (3-5 mins is more than enough) or you'll end up with itchy skin.
B001E6OUG4|5|This product is great, covers and blends in like no other.  Makes me look like I'm ready for a photo-shoot, and at my age (60+) no less.  I'm completely happy with my purchase.  OK, so it's a little pricey, but isn't that the cost of looking great?
B0001ZZLU8|5|i bought this because my daughter is breaking out with pimples and blackheads and i don`t want her to use stuff that burns her skin it`s been 2 days and i notice an improvement i also been giving her active teen vitaims there great together
B007KWSHWY|5|I will order this cleanser again. A little goes a long way. Not a bad price, it will last a long time.
B000XEFATY|5|makes me smell soon good
B002W2JJB0|5|Love this product. Goes on easily as a  lotion and blends into your skin. Will work if you aren't lying out in the sun in intense heat.
B00EA0XSP0|1|I usually like essie nail polish but these smaller bottles seem to be a different formula and do not go on as smoothly.
B008PEXV3Q|5|this item was just as described i like that it has all the different sizes because it helps add more dynamics to the design.
B0013EGSF8|5|I started using Tigi Treat Me Right mask to help with an extremely itchy scalp.  The peppermint cools the scalp and is a great non-medicated choice to relieve the itches.  I have fine hair that is permed, and this mask conditions my hair without leaving it limp or greasy.  As I only wash my hair twice a week, I use the mask about twice a month.  The jar lasts a very long time, and is something I will always keep on hand.
B008XLEXRO|5|It's great!
B001F51R6K|5|My husband ordered these - they fit his razor and he is pleased with his purchase
B000AN1JEI|5|Works great
B0070TSNSA|5|Nice scent, great lotion for a very reasonable price. The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming. I will buy this again!
B005TTSDYW|5|I remember walking into the Etude House store in South Korea and I would see this product everywhere and sales associate would promote this to everyone. Unfortunately I decided to pass on this product because I didn’t see the hype in this. I must say I regret not buying this while I was there because this is such a good product. I love this freshener and I am so happy Amazon have this! I have oily skin and this freshener really does its job by absorbing the oil on my face. So far I am happy with my purchase and I will continue to buy this product!
B0036YMVEU|4|I like the product. There are many ways to mix and apply. Had to figure out what works best for me bcause it can look a tad dark
B004GVC0B6|5|I love this product!
B0043OYFKU|5|Very pleased!     PROS:  *works like a high dollar system for a fraction of the cost.  *sample cleanser comes with pkg. (save for airline travel)  *water resistant  *comes with duracell batteries  *2 speeds and seperate on/off button   *fits hand perfect but yet small enough to travel with.    CONS:  *no booklet but really not necessary  *battery compartment hard to open but thanks to previous posts I knew to put \\"umph\\" into it.    TIP:If you get it at Walgreens you get an extra 6 oz tube of cleanser in addition with the 3/4 oz one in the brush box.(limited time)$20 value
B003Z2E3FS|3|It's okay, works fine to add extra conditioning to hair, but nothing fantastic. My biggest complaint is the smell. Very strong chemical smell. Wouldn't buy again.
B009YXC3LS|5|This blush is soooooooo pigmented! I have it in Superstar and Headliner and both colors are gorgeous and work well with my very pale skin. It also lasts forever on your cheeks. However, given the superior pigmentation of this product it is very important to apply it correctly or you will end up looking like a clown. I always shake it before applying and then I squirt the smallest quantity possible - that will be plenty! I always do this on the back of my hand and I would never recommend applying the product directly from the container to the face. I then blend the product on the back of my hand with the ELF Small Stippling brush and then apply it to my cheeks. I start with very little product, blending it in very well, because you can always layer more if you want a more intense color. I love it!
B003E0KC2Y|5|This stuff works great for me.<br />It does not get the ones that r from hormones but o well nothing really can take care of those.<br />I also wish they could send the toner to me but seeing as I'm not in the US right now no go there. -_-'
B00JQLDZ2Y|5|great softening agent
B00AUUIG8S|5|great product and good price
B00CXG1K1M|5|Awesome colors!! I thought I would receive it damaged but they came fast and not damaged at all!!!
B00QGMSD1O|4|nice product
B001D9U07A|5|This product is amazing! I love Olaplex.. My hair has never looked better- EVER! A++<br />Worth every penny.
B00HHI7VKU|4|Great formula but needs new packaging. Formula is too thick for tube.
B002YV9Q4O|5|I've been using this product for almost a month and I'm very pleased so far with the results!! I had lost a lot of my lashes from having individual lashes done continously; and I wanted  natural looking lashes; they haven't gotten as long as I hope to get, but they are definitely thicker and fuller and when I put on my mascara they look great .I also use it on my eyebrows and they have filled in great so far so good just waiting on some length!!
B000056EYY|5|I bought this as a gift.  I came quickly and in perfect condition.  if you like tommy girl then you know how it smells... I would highly recommend purchasing.<br /><br />Thanks
B00JB6R7NM|5|It says for men... but he didn't like smell. I LOVE this. Feels great, smells great. .I make sure to have in my shower when I know it will be a long day. .great way to start the day
B00L0R5494|5|I have waited awhile for this color comb.  Most others have colors I didn't want.
B00BC27QFW|5|Excellent.
B004Z209HS|5|I am absolutely happy with the results ...my skin and hair have a noticeable difference and I only have to use a fraction of what I used with other products. Leaving my skin so soft without any residue behind on my clothes... I am in love !!
B003EMZYJ8|5|I used this as a sample in the tanning salon for the first time last summer after it was recommended by the staff.  I am very fair skinned and most tanning lotions with a bronzer give me that orange glow which everyone dreads.  This is the first product that I have used that gives that extra color without looking fake. I use this lotion every other session and it continues to give good effect. The smell is pleasant and the results are great.
B0085YKN4Q|5|I've been looking for the perfect blue and this was it! I am over the moon satisfied! :)
B00FAEOCP0|4|I was expecting big things from this mascara after all the rave reviews on Amazon, but after using it for the first time today, I wasn't as wowed as I hoped! It's definitely not bad - just not as life changing as some of the other reviews seem to claim.<br /><br />The good:<br />No irritation, which is always a plus. I have sensitive skin so I tend to be wary when using any new products, but this one has given me no issues so far.<br />No smudging or flaking! That said, I only had it on for maybe 4 or 5 hours before washing my face, so we'll see how it holds up for an entire day. So far so good though.<br />Easy to remove just by washing my face, which was nice - with my usual mascara (Sephora full action extreme effect), if I try to just wash it off it ends up smudging under my eyes.<br /><br />The not so good:<br />It went on a little clumpy; I had to manually separate out some of my top lashes after applying it.<br />I didn't feel like I got as much of a volumizing effect as I was hoping. It wasn't terrible, just...not much better than the average drugstore mascara. For the price, I was definitely hoping for more.<br /><br />All in all, I'm not sure the product is good enough to justify its price point, and I'll likely end up going back to my previous brand.
B0050PSC00|2|I spent a bit over $50 for this flat iron but it was not worth the money. I have coarse hair (shoulder length) and the flat iron does not straight my hair the way my older iron did. I bought this one mainly because the titanium/tourmaline surface and for the &#34;promise&#34; that my hair does not tangled up between the flat iron's corners. Unfortunately, this happened on my first use! It does get hot ( not enough to straight my hair the way I like) and the outside plastic does not protect your hands from the heat. It is very easy to get burn. I did not returned it because I was very very busy and I missed the time window to do it.. Oh well. I do not recommend this product. I am researching for a new flat iron...
B0046VJTX8|5|Thanks! It's been a  long time since I last used one, so this might take a while!
B00KWTKDR4|5|I love this brush! It works great for both me and my daughter, with either wet or dry hair. Definitely gets the tangles out easier than any brush I've ever owned.
B00KSLWHKC|1|They would be ok for a nearsighted mouse, otherwise ridiculous.
B004WPHVVK|5|I cannot find this in stores.....was happy to get it online.  It is a great product.  I received it promptly....that was good.
B005JXFRFG|5|This is a very good replacement headgear.  It fits perfectly and is more comfortable than the headgear that came with the CPAP machine.
B00SCF4IDA|5|Awesome - I love coming home to the lovely smells!
B00MHTW366|5|This is such a great evening bag. It is small but it fit my iPhone 5 some lipstick and my credit card. I received tons of complements on it.
B00KWGFA5C|5|Super fast shipping exactly as described
B00MEO9WHM|3|Doesn't live up to  guarantee to have erections ,my weenie is still limp, but it does give you a extra boost of energy.
B00LU1V3JK|5|Love this stuff!!  Will order again!!
B000NFEX5K|5|One of my friends is a hair dresser and recommended this stuff to me when I visited Belize for my hair that she had recently colored for me.  I have to say my color has lasted longer than it ever has this time and the conditioning aspect of this product beats anything else I have ever tried!  Love this product.  Plan on getting lots more.  Doc
B00I3OMMCO|5|This product is amazing.  My beard grows very wild but with beard balm I can tame it and it even makes my beard look thicker. The smell isn't as bad as other reviews say. Great gift for the bearded one in your life. Will always recommend.
B00FGI9SPO|5|Awesome just as described
B003VRA1E4|1|I ordered 3 items from them. I only got 2. And they have charged my account for whole three items  And the best part is one item is not even the exact item I ordered.  So, If you are going to order from them, think twice
B00JPD7LWS|5|Love it!
B003NV9R2U|5|Smells awesome
B004MJGDQ0|4|Great and easy to use
B006GQYSC8|4|This thing is a fast shave, painless and easy to clean up. Only complaint, I shave my head and it does not get close enough for me.
B009SRJTL2|2|Dosis De Amor Eau De Parfums Spray for Women, 3.3 Ounce By Alejandra...<br />smells terrible<br />makes me headache<br />would return it<br />very disappointed
B00X96Q2G8|5|perfect👌
B008D5HAHU|1|I was in the hospital and had a friend spray it into my hair and then brush through small areas at a time. I looked almost gray after using this product. The texture also felt really dry.
B00GQ0GD4A|5|It does look and feel like a really cool little gadget so I get a kick out of using it!<br /><br />The matt stainless steel finish is classy and it didn’t slip out of my hands the way my last nail clipper did – drove me insane!<br /><br />It is very sharp and cuts right through my fingernails with no effort.  Glad I discovered this nail clipper.
B00I8TL8IS|1|Both quit within 6 months.
B00A3WR5C6|5|Purchased the kit last week. Tried to use a regular polish in between base and top coat. Learned you can't mix polish type. You must use the gel polish only. I love it. It has been on for almost a week and I can tell already that I will be doing my own nails from now on. Had this done a a salon 3 times and 2 out f 3 it only lasted about 10 days. Felt like I was not getting my money's worth. This way I have control.
B00HNKQU0O|4|The Axe anti-perspirant got a workout this weekend. Between lawn mowing, hedge clipping, and raking, my husband was a sore sweaty mess - but he was blissfully dry and pleasant smelling. The Axe worked great, and the smell of it is pleasant, not overpowering. It's definitely a product my husband will buy when this one runs out.
B001E96NKC|5|Good stuff
B00SVYCGJA|5|These extensions are even more beautiful than I expected them to be!! Especially for the price, such a great deal. Same quality as hair extensions from Sally Hansen that sell for ~$100. The clips are sewn on tight, great quality clips. The color is exactly what I expected also!<br />The only thing is I washed them two days after I got them and they started shedding a lot and became very dry and tangled, I'm not sure if that is because of the shampoo and conditioner I used/maybe the water was too hot? But they still look awesome! You just definitely have to be gentle and careful with them :)
B000143C0K|4|I really like these trimmers, they were packaged really well and shipped fairly quick. They were light and the blades cut very close to skin. They take much longer to begin to get too hot for touch which is great. Easy to keep clean and the cord helps with any tangled cord situations you may have. They cut really well and I do recommend this item to anyone.
B000WHYATS|3|It's okay...maybe I just don't know how to use this tool or it doesn't work for me...
B0046VGPHQ|5|I can't rave about this self-tanner enough! It gives me a bronzed flawless glow. I can't count the times I've been complimented on my complexion. I'm pregnant, so people have been telling me that \\"I'm glowing\\", but really its because of this product lol. I've read some other negative reviewers, who say this product made them orange. The only way you'll get an orange result is if you have on SPF or deodorant. The spray bottle hasn't given me any issue with leaking. I've traveled with the spray container everywhere, and no problems yet. I think the mitt is the real clincher here though. It's really what gives you the flawless result. However, I don't like that the mitt isn't machine washable or waterproof (hence the included gloves). BUT, it is very easy to buy a tanning mitt elsewhere with these qualities.<br /><br />This product gives you even, tanned skin... it really does make you look flawless. Try it out!

B00BLDA3J8|5|works great!
B008YEMWOG|5|Perfect kit for touching up coffee stains. A+ recommend
B00014DZX4|3|Nice and light for summer!
B001VEK1KI|5|It fit and works great
B007T79E0E|5|This is a nice weight, very large vinyl cape. It is well made and should last us a long time. The neck piece can be adjusted to accommodate even the largest of necks. Yes, in hot weather, without being in an air-conditioned environment, you'll probably sweat. It was mailed out to us very quickly.
B00120MFG4|5|This is perfect for my light to dirty blonde hair color. Last all day and doesn't smudge, but it easy to wash off. The pencil applies wonderfully, and the brush at the other end really makes this a great product. It looks completely natural, and I highly recommend it to anyone!
B001ET6X7A|5|I have sensitive teeth for no reason, no cavities, no problems. This toothpaste helps so that I can eat the foods I love with no problems. It's hard to find in stores so I am glad I am able to buy it on Amazon. The other Sensodyne flavors give me canker sores, but this one doesn't, so I am sticking with it.
B007L0NORI|5|Love it! Perfect gift!
B004DIXYWG|4|I've used the face primer and I like the feel it imparts.  My skin looks more even and polished and my makeup stays on all day.  I have used it before applying liquid foundation and also when I just want to wear a loose mineral makeup and it works well.  I have rosacea and need something to make my foundation cover longer and better and this seems to work.  I would recommend it to friends.
B0077LAJT2|5|I prefer these blades to any others I have tried, but WalMart quit carrying them in favor of Wilkinson blades. This 100 count box will last you well over a year if you change blades infrequently, even if you have coarse, hard facial hair. I have been using the last box I bought for over a year now and am still nowhere near ready to order more.
B00HDH94K0|5|My new favorite!
B004KEWXQQ|4|HAIR MUST BE LIGHT COLOR TO GET FULL AFFECT. BLEACH HAIR OUT GOOD. I DID MY HAIR TWO SHADES PURPLE N YELLOW. MY HAIR IS DARK SO I HAD TO BLEACH IT OUT N YELLOW TOOK LIKE BLONDE N ONE PURPLE(VIOLET)WAS A REDISH PURPLE KINDA. BUT DONT MATTER I AM JUST PLAYING AROUND WITH COLORS.
B004R101EI|5|A wonderful cleansing foam!  When you first apply the foam, it has some small, smooth exfoliating particles sprinkled throughout.  These particles dissolve as you work the product into your skin and leave a rich, fluffy foam to complete the cleansing process.  This cleansing foam rinses easily and completely and left my face feeling soft and supple.  The tube is a generous size and will last a few months, easily.  The scent is a very mild herbal scent that would probably not bother most folks who are sensitive to perfumes.  This is a very nice product that I will be buying again!
B00H94BV76|5|Great product easy to use, beautiful design.  Prompt delivery.
B00K9DI2CQ|5|Super fast shipping! Great quality
B00FVRRA00|4|I like the different colors.
B004NZ3D66|4|Girlfriend really liked it, she said it was good quality. The bottles are the small ones but they seemed to have lasted a decent amound of time.
B000XE8T4C|4|This was the go-to gift to my mom when I was in my teens.  I sent this to her as a novelty gift and she really likes it... Fun product.
B003JK4MW0|3|I am always researching products for my light acne. I must confess the Zeno has worked for me.  Here's the thing. Sometimes it worked really well on painful emerging pimples around my chin. And that was great!  Other times it seemed to make already there pimples fade faster.    But many times, I did not notice a real difference. It seems a bit hit or miss. And sometimes it has made some spots worse.  I think it depends on the kind of pimple and where it is on your face.    I would buy it again because when it has worked, it has saved me from getting large painful pimples.
B00NW5CFXK|5|Sturdy and awesome! I love this so much haha, I wear it with everything.
B001L9C2MI|3|To Tight if your feet swell!
B00CFBKCP0|5|As advertised, good price, fast shipper.
B001619ZFI|5|Good product; great price; prompt delivery. Perfect size to carry my diabetes paraphernalia on trips to keep it all together. It does come with  hook to hang it, but the hook comes off if you want to use it without it.
B00GHNOQ54|5|I love the nail polish it does exactly what it suppose to do even on natural nails. I polished both my natural nails And my acrylic  nails and only had to use 3 coats on them...
B007XNJ10W|4|All the fruits that came in the wheel were the same size but not the same thickness. There were a few messed up ones but I stilled liked them. I was able to fit two watermelon slices on one nail. Oh, and as I was putting it on the nail and trying to get it to curve so it won't fall off, it made a crack. It was easily covered up with a top coat. In conclusion, they are super cute! Good quality for the price.
B00329L8TS|5|I love this! I've tried a lot of primes in the past and this would be the only one  I WOULD BUY AGAIN!  THANK YOU!
B00ATFXMLK|5|Bought it for my husband and he loves it (and so do I!!!) It smells great :)
B00FAEOCP0|5|This mascara is AMAZING. I highly recommend it! If you have thicker lashes, just don't apply as much or if you want really long, dramatic lashes, this is perfect with a few extra strokes of mascara! Love this stuff, I won't buy anything else from now on. I am a model and tell anyone who asks to go BIG or go home.
B0000C4COL|1|complete waste of money. it only irritated my skin and i saw no improvement at all. do not buy
B00D0ANSAG|4|Great price and great variety.  These sponges individually can run as much as $5 in your local stores; assuming they carry them.  I am not a MUA but wanted what the professionals are using.  My favourite is the green sponge because it's great for highlighting.  The only negative thing I have to say is when I washed the green sponge it came apart easily.  I thought I followed the washing directions carefully.  I would definitely recommend this company and buy from them again.
B006Z8XU76|5|BEST TOOTHPASTE EVER. Saw results after 3 days! Can't find this brand in stores anymore so have to order it online but well worth it!
B009F1L1JE|1|It does glow but rubs off in hours. In one day we had to reapply 5 times. By the end of the night there was no polish left.
B00756HQNQ|5|This product is well made and very effective.  I purchased it after a similar product was used during my pedicure. I've always had an issue with very dry/peeling heels and I have tried several drugstore products that require a lot more work.  I use this twice weekly and my heels look great!
B001ET76AI|5|buen producto
B00142E9NC|5|This is a more softer patchouli scented lotion. I love the way it feels on my skin. Absorbs quickly as stated.<br />AbesMarket saved me a lot of money plus free shipping. Win! Win! Thanks for delivering a great product. You guys are my new favorite market place.
B00384TLQE|5|I smelled this as a sample and immediately ordered a bottle.  It's so light and fresh, just a tiny bit sweet.  I LOVE IT!  My only complaint is that it seems to fade fairly quickly for a parfum.
B000ZRFBJI|5|Thank you so much.  I use this cream daily, and it is wonderful.  Sometimes, I even use it on my feet after a pedicure.  Thank you.
B000NPVDB2|5|If you are like me and your hair is thinning then this is the product for you. works great and smells great.
B00A3LVMMQ|5|So far so good on this. It matches my Merkur pretty good.<br /><br />It doesn't allow some of the larger handle brushes (Van Der Hagen) but works well with the Tweazerman and Escali. I didn't seem to have the issues with lopsidedness or bulge in the padding on the bottom. I have a smaller sink so this is kept in the medicine cabinet so I don't see having issues with water and pad like some have commented on these types of stands.<br /><br />I'll update if anything changes.
B000FQ73O0|5|In the process of using, at 30 days think it is stimulating hair growth.
B002XITLL6|5|Even at age 54 I still get occasional breakouts.  I'm very good about washing my face & using product to help breakouts, but the Zeno Hot Spot is really the key.  If you get one of those blemishes that is hard, inflamed & under the skin......the Zeno Hot Spot really zaps them.  The heat from the Hot Spot kills the bacteria in & around the blemish & speeds the healing process. The literature in the package will tell you exactly what kind of blemishes the Zeno Hot Spot will help.  It really works. This is the second one I've bought.  You get about 80 charges in each Zeno Hot Spot.  The first one lasted me over 6 months.  I highly recommend this product.
B000850C1Y|5|Good product...as advertised
B003EBNLIA|5|Well , for one thing , I've always loved NYX products ! They're affordable and you usually get more than what you pay for . They were delivered quick and I just LOVE the colors ! They're so beautiful and exotic ! A must have ! Extremely satisfied !
B00005BQ4N|5|The Sassy Lady Bug comb and brush set is super cute!  The bristles on the brush are very soft and the comb is a good length.  My daughter likes to play with the set and I love doing her hair with them!
B0012HCCNI|4|The rose smell is STRONG, but only when it first goes on. My first thought when I sprayed it was, &#34;Hello, Grandma's house,&#34; although not in a negative way. But I can't detect any rose smell on myself after a few minutes, so whatever it smells like when I spray it doesn't ultimately matter. It also works, which certainly wasn't true with other products, natural or artificial. Hope the Weleda deodorant works as well in summer as in winter. I will likely try a different scent next time.
B005V2UI5Y|5|This is very high quality, potent oil.  I use it with distilled water as a spray for my hair and it's great.  The smell fades if you don't overdo it.  If you know tea tree, it doesn't exactly smell like roses.
B00KQASCDG|4|Love the feel of shea Butter, the product has a distinct smell that takes a little getting used too.  After a few minuets it warms in your hands from body heat to be able to spread.  Use daily for overall moisturizing and also to LOC natural hair with other natural oils.  Great product for the price
B003QB033O|5|Product is amazing, Smells great and last at least twice as long as any other organic deodorant I've tried. Great!
B002A8807K|5|I have light brown hair and I got this just to add a little kick to my hair color. Very pretty, golden, even without lightning my hair.
B008L36S7W|4|I'd searched for a beautiful burgundy lip color with no pinks in it for so long, but it also had to be sheer when applied lightly, so as to give the &#34;popsicle mouth&#34; coverage rather than old-lady powder mouth.... this does it, it's really gorgeous, only issue with it is that it really doesn't stay the same after an hour or so, the color sort of becomes more tan/sienna than burgundy. That combined with the fact that the ingredients are really not natural and I normally wouldn't purchase anything that goes on or in my mouth with unnatural/non-food-grade ingredients means I'll not purchase again, but I'll use this until it's gone.
B000FCCCRW|5|When wearing braces these things make it very easy to floss with.  This product is exactly like the one my dentist carries.
B005IKCP9G|5|Arrived and just as pictured.  Thank you! :)
B000V8MTIC|5|I bought this for my 8 yr old whose hair doesnt grow she has very fine hair. Within 2wks ive noticed new growth and its thicker!! Only downside is its very oily and has a strong smell. But i will buy again.
B0015K9BXQ|2|This clipper is alright as long as you don't plan on cutting a lot of hair.  The unit lacks enough power to trim anything more than a couple days of growth on your head.
B00CCYCYMO|5|Thank You
B00HGQS3H8|5|work good.
B00CSTM3II|3|I did see some new growth but not much while and after taking this . I Was hoping for better results since i was taken so many a day . However the hair that i already had on my face looked/felt MUCH better while taking these .
B00FGTZEQK|2|Its ok.... Not bad but nothing special. I gave it to a friend after just one wearing. She likes it. I don't. I won't order this again.
B001I90NL8|4|I have used this product for a long time now and have enjoyed it since I started.<br />Hairspray bothers my scalp and this keeps my hair in place and shiny in place of the hairspray.
B003JMWP68|3|My hair dresser had one and I decided it was worth the money.  I'm not fussy about my hair and this is the most I've ever spend on a hair dryer.  It gets really hot (be careful) and I found my naturally curly hair to be more managable after using it.  I loved it.  Alas, after 8 months it died.  I'm on the fence about spending that kind of money again.  If I do, I'll keep my receipt.
B000YB1U8Q|5|Comb over made the girl come over.
B003NRYG1Q|5|Nice mirror to have to pluck your eyebrows, and to see to put makeup on, etc. I use mine every day! One side is regular mirror and the other side is a good magnification to see small things, especially when you get older and can't see well!
B0028WVIF4|5|Very well made... This cap will last a long time... So excited I have this cap in my collection
B00I134Y82|5|This a terrific product at a terrific price.  I use it on my hair, skin, and nails.  This oil is of the same high quality as others that cost 2 or 3 times as much.  Product was delivered in a timely manner.  I will definitely purchase this item again from the same seller.
B000050FDY|5|I received this product in a timely manner, and in perfect condition.To preserve the life of these refill cartridges I highly suggest to pop off the top of shaver and brush out loose hair trimmings before you have the auto clean do it's job. Also only use auto clean once or twice a week, this system works great for me.
B00F7QITYQ|5|Best product ever !!!
B00LFW8R52|5|This pattern called pink swirls is very bright and beautiful like all Vera Bradley bags. The shipping was prompt and this pencil bag is a perfect compliment to the Vera Bradley Pink Swirls Backpack and Vera Bradley Pink Swirls collection in general. It's very well made.
B003983I1S|4|The best long lasting blade ....and it stays sharp too!....but beware of counterfeit one's ......even from major sellers !....was once a victim ,they will tear out your face from the get go !
B007JOXS4U|5|This is my first ever review.  I bought this from Walmart. $7  I really think in reading the reviews that it is more for those who are looking for a more natural look.  I used it very lightly on my blond eyelashes.  It did not clump.  I went slowly and carefully.  It gave added color to my lashes.  Im not a makeup person.  A little eyeshadow and mascara are all I do.  I have a hard time with mascaras because I have very curly lashes and they always caused mine to clump together.  I like the natural look for me.  Im low maintenance.  For those who wear makeup and think this will replace mascara, they will be disappointed.  I have thick naturally curly lashes, they are just light.  This was perfect for me.
B00G9XOX82|1|When I first tried it, the tea tree effect was too much. It made my skin and scalp cold and tingly. It was uncomfortable to use for the two weeks I had it. That wasn't the worst thing though- myself and my girlfriend noticed after using this conditioner, our hair was coming out in clumps, literally handfuls of hair were coming out, sitting in the plug and covering us when we washed. We brush our hair through to get rid of dead hairs before showering so we knew it wasn't dead hair and it really was frightening. I have since read that other herbal essence products also have this effect do I am avoiding completely from now on!
B003DAXHW2|5|I love this product.  My previous facial cleanser/toner left me with flaky dryness around my nose.  I had to use a scrub several times a week.  I have been using Dr. Gross' cleanser/toner for about six weeks and while it leaves my face feeling clean, there is no flaky dryness or peeling around my nose.  I highly recommend this product for anyone with trouble finding the right balance of facial cleansers.
B00L1KFQKC|5|I recently purchased this for myself because I was tired of buying Pantene conditioner or other brands at Rite Aid, and thought I would try this one.<br /><br />Simply: The BEST conditioner I have ever used and more natural. My hair is so soft and shiny now and this doesn't weigh my hair down. I LOVE IT! My mom tried it and she can't wait to get her own! Thank you, we are both very satisfied and we both thank you for it. It is refreshing to come across a product that actually does what it says!
B0027A8N1E|5|I bought this machine because my husband has psorasis on his fingertips.  We had tried every prescription cream out there, without any success.  He uses this twice a day and his fingertips are completely healed.  I use it regularly to combat dry winter skin on my hands and feet.  It is incredibly simple to use, well made and I would highly recommend the unit.
B000L9NR3M|2|I am 49 years old and was looking for a more gentle product for cleansing.  I have sent an e-mail to Jean D'Aveze explaining that I was a huge fan of a gentle cleaning product they had in the 1990's called Soins Regenerscents Creme Nettoyonte Douce Gentle Cream Cleanser (water soluble) and I was hoping against hope this product was similar. This cleansed and left your skin relaxed and calm not rosy!    I just find Gentle Facial Gel a bit rough, though as cleaners go it is a good product compare to cheaper ones.    I have Roscea and while I use the Douceur De Teint Stop Au Rougeurs to reduce this high colouring I think the Gentle facial gel with plant extracts takes away from the good work the Douceur De Teint has done!
B00B5K2H7I|2|Short life expectancy! Mine and my sisters stopped working after only about 6 months of use. I give this product two stars only because it worked well for the time that it actually worked. However, I am Very disatisfied in the life of the fan. The fan stopped working only 6 months into using it. Now it is useless and only makes a beeping sound when I try to turn it on.
B008DI7WBQ|5|Great hair blower! Heavy duty and very powerful. If anything were to go wrong with this I hope it will still be available to purchase again. Whoops just went in to do my hair and the heat has gone out. So upset this should have lasted longer<br />Than this.
B008BDQKR0|1|Is this a joke? Horrible.
B0049LUI9O|5|works perfectly love this product easy to clean as a well
B004TO637W|5|The first time I experienced this was at the spa, I was broke out pretty bad and they put it all over my face as a full mask. The girl told me that within 24 hours I would notice &#34;purging&#34; then I would see improvements in my skin and OMG this stuff really works! I loved it so much I ordered a container to have on hand. I've been using it once a week as a full mask and as needed as spot treatment. I definitely recommend people to buy this, this product really is amazing.
B001E0VBDK|1|It is too soon to fairly judge the product. At this time , I cannot see a difference  in my complexion.
B000JL69XC|5|smells good
B00OI62AI2|2|I bought a small set of icing brushes and i thought they were amazing so I wanted to buy a larger set. I was disappointed, the ones that are supposed to be used for foundation and liquid or creme products are horrible. I do like the fluffy ones, the large ones are good for blush, powder and bronzer and the small ones are amazing for blending your eyeshadow.<br /><br />I would recommend to buy the ones you are going to use individually not this set. You wont find any brush to apply eyeshadows (just blending) and as I said you cant use any of these with liquid or cream products.
B000UZB3Z6|5|The shaver works like in was brand new.Great service. I do not have to spend the time or money looking for a new shaver.
B00AYIZBZ2|5|Probably one of the best hair wax I ever used. It is great for short and mid long hair for little spikyness! great for style! Awesome! being using this product for over 3 years!
B001CT09LS|4|for this price is steal. This European fragrance I saw back in Europe 50 years ago in Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungaria. Austria
B004C6OG3K|4|Have been using this product for some<br />time.  It is super.  It is non-drying, minimizes pore size &<br />does not sink into lines & wrinkles.  I use it as foundation &<br />sun protection.  Other foundations look like masks; this product is natural looking.  Luv it!
B0034BUQ42|4|I have not use it yet,but it seems good
B00BAY7A5I|4|A bit small for the price , but completes my Coach set. Very Happy.  If you like Coach you will be satisfied
B000NJ01I4|1|Wasn't what I expected, only good for fingernails not toenails - Would NOT recommend, these are a waste of money!  Claude DeMoss  San Jose, CA
B005HIGYYQ|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this gel. As does every girl with curls, I have a lot of curly hair products. Most don't deliver for my 3A/3B hair. Or I have to use a combo of products to get nice curly definition but avoid curl crunch. This has become my absolute favorite curly hair product and I can not live without it. As long as you don't overdo the amount, it won't leave your hair crunchy. It will be touchable and defined and shiny. Everyone's curls are different but this stuff works great in mine.
B003HFS6EW|5|It was just what I ordered. Good price.
B002CMLHEC|5|My all time favorite!!!
B003FDBG48|5|The Best Perfume EVER!!! - I got it as a graduation Gift.<br />I'll Keep buying it till the day I stop Existing. Its so Unique and one of a kind.<br />A smell to remember!!<br /><br />If your a soft, elegant, and a Sexy woman with a cute personality and sprite.<br />You definitely need this perfume.<br /><br />It is a Must Have.
B000R80ZTQ|2|I owned a remington for 5+ years and it quit on me so I purchased this dryer from my local store because it was reasonably priced and it had the reel style cord.  Well I have only owned it for 3 months and it has decided to quit on me there is a short in the cord somewhere and if it is not plugged in just right it will not work.  I had to go out and purchase a new dryer I went with the remington again.
B000HGUAW0|5|i use it on my baby, head to toe. She never had diaper rash or dry skin problem. recommend it!
B000O7S3VW|5|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  It came very fast, packaged very well, and the real deal.  Can't beat the savings. I'll never pay full price again!  Thank you.
B00F4PDA3U|1|All of the rings are too small, the skull and the heart one look nothing like the picture. They look deformed. Very Cheap , would not buy. The only plus was that they came pretty fast. But i don't recommend and would NEVER buy again.
B002RT70WI|5|I Really like this product. It Protects my hair especially as I use hair dryer to style.  I never want to run out of this.
B000GBID0M|3|I bought the Vitality as a temporary brush until the repair on my Oral-B Sonic complete was finished. Considering this brush costs less that $20 it's excellent. I'd still rather use the   Vitality than a regular toothbrush if I had to choose. I think it keeps my teeth much cleaner than  manual brushing.
B0095IMNI0|5|had one similar but tooth brush and flosser were separate and took up space. This is more compact and easier to use. The price was the best  I compared it to local stores
B005CHHO4Q|4|This is a good product, but takes time.
B00VXE0EEY|5|$5- What a deal :)
B005XOXRQC|1|Cuts great and still better than a Wahl brand clipper. After a month the Andis clipper would turn on and off  while in the on position (never dropped it, handled with care). In order to keep the clipper from shutting off I need a rubber band to keep pressure on the switch. Has not shutoff yet while the rubber band is on.  UPDATE JULY 17, 2015 Rubber band or not, it finally gave out. KAPUT! (minus one star)
B00898E6DM|5|Best type of brush I've ever used.  Wood bristles feel great on the scalp and go through tangled hair with ease.  Love that there are NO little balls at the end of the bristles.  Sometimes I keep brushing my hair long after I could stop...just to get the scalp massage!
B005CGREGA|5|like it
B00HN6ILCI|5|Very nice and good quality
B0000YV6CM|4|The price was twice as high as the original product. It was the real thing though. Need to find an inexpensive alternative.
B00DWKRJ18|4|Full sized bottles.  The color samples on the bottles are accurate except for the Orange & the white/sparkly color which are more of a clear color- works nicely over top another color though.
B002V66IIO|5|As described.
B003H6C764|5|What can one say.....FLOWERBOMB....anyway you shape it, small, medium or large size...it is a beautiful fragrance. I own this in all the sizes and have the travel for work and vacation.
B002TMJB7K|3|Nice, durable quality. However, it seems to run small. I bought it for my 5 year old, who is more like a 6 year old in height/weight. If she were to only wear it around the hairline, it would be fine.  But it is a stretch to have it cover her ears and she doesn't like it.  It's pretty tight.  I'm trying to stretch it out.
B001FB5I7S|5|For whatever reason, other deodorants I've tried typically give me a rash after using them for a while. This one does not. It also seems to be the most effective I've tried in actually eliminating odors. The lavender is very subtle, and really is not noticeable after application. One word of caution - if you take this on a plane, and have it upside down, the pressure change can cause it to leak everywhere. Overall, the by far my favorite deodorant.
B002RZM2UW|5|A little goes a long way! It works like a super hold hairspray also.
B003E06KC0|5|This is absolutely the best ever lip gloss!  It is moisturizing, and also stays on well.The range has wonderful colors, with or without glitter, so you an look as vavavoooom as you like.
B004INCW4W|1|Sorry, but this stuff is terrible.  Caused me to breakout bad.  I understand that every one will react differently to different products, but this is what happened in my case. Something in this gel does not work well with me.  I am writing this review as a reminder to myself not to use this product.
B000FEIOHW|5|I know what you're thinking: should i believe the 5-star reviews or the 1-star reviews? I've been using mine for over a year with no problems. Alkaline batteries last fairly long (more than 2 weeks) brushing twice a day. I don't brush my teeth underwater like many of the 1-star folks apparently do. i wet the brush with a little water, put on a dab of paste and try to brush as best i can with the base/handle higher than the brush so less water/saliva runs toward the base/handle. i clean the brush by, again, holding the head/brush lower and pouring water only onto the head/brush...none even touches that battery cap with holes in it on the base. if i feel that water got into the base or screw-off head/brush, i open and check for water and dry as necessary. the battery cap at the bottom seems all right: i'm kinda careful when i take it off though. power is good although u can feel it getting a little weaker before the batteries die. overall very happy with it.
B000VWKIMC|5|Good price on a hard to find in store color
B00TY0UEP8|5|I lost the tweezers I had for years on a recent trip. I needed tweezers fast! These tweezers are perfect along with the price. They're precise and sharp. They pull out tiny hairs without missing and grabbing skin. They came in a great little plastic tube and have a rubber protector for the tips. I found them easy and comfortable to hold. I would absolutely recommend them.
B00DAG7I4C|4|So it says eyeliners but like half of the &#34;eyeliners &#34; I received were actually lip liners:<br />Light pink<br />L. Pink glitter<br />Mauve<br />Hot cocoa<br />peach<br />soft pink<br />Pink pearl<br />pink glitter<br />Shinning red<br />Cinnamon<br />Rust<br />Plush red<br />purple glitter<br />natural<br />Hot red<br />Hot Pink<br />Cabaret<br />They even say lip liner on them so I don't know if it's just mine but be warned there are lip liners<br /><br />Now getting that out of the way they do work pretty good for the price there not as good as an urban decay 24 eyeliner but they don't suck.<br />And the lip liners are nice
B003C1X2TK|3|Helps with lengthening but not with volumizing. It will take a while to see a difference though. One thing that I hate about this is the fact that you have to put it on consistently to see a good results... only because I am the type to forget or get lazy. Overall, I find it to be an OKAY product... nothing too much to gush about.
B00FFY00P6|3|This product is ok, nothing special.  I was expecting something along the lines of their 3 Minute Miracle.
B00009RF1E|1|no good
B00092M2VO|5|This a great dryer, dries hair fast, no frizz main reason I bought., yes I would recommend this to anyone.<br />Haven't found anything I dislike.
B005UGVIYG|5|I bought this to make applying oil to my eyelashes more convenient and hygienic. I've found that using a mascara that washes off when splashed with water and conditioning my eyelashes with olive oil keeps my lashes from becoming brittle and breaking off. This applicator does a nice job of keeping the oil from seeping out and does what it is supposed to do. There's nothing really fancy about it, but I wasn't expecting there to be. Shipping was prompt and the product arrived in good condition. I would order again.
B000IU0XIQ|1|This product did nothing for me.  In fact, my skin was a bit worse while I was using it.
B003639V1W|5|Very nice color must have to add to your MAC or lipstick collection. I have no complaints and I think it works well with many shades. I am a deep chocolate and it looked beautiful on me.
B004W9DU7U|5|Is really good works well like bubz said
B003983I1S|5|great product. love it.  just what I needed.  couldn't ask for better.  worth every penny.  best of the best. perfect.
B001H5Z9GW|5|Works. Very natural. A bit messy to apply powder, but I don't mind for such a healthy product. Container last a very long time.
B001PEZAHI|5|After started using this Argan Oil, my face looks much better and I'm not spending a lot of money on it any more. I also put a little on my unruly hair every time I wash it which is every other day. Now I don't have the fly always. It's great for dry hair. It makes my face feel very smooth. I am much pleased with it.
B0029U0YKK|3|One star if I ranked it on value for the money. No better than the ones I buy at the drugstore for far less money.
B002ESQ55K|5|Dreamy and irresistible fragrance.
B003EYTYB0|5|Works great. We NEVER burn. It does sting my kids face so we use a special formula for faces for the kiddos.
B0087OWFO0|5|My hair is naturally curly and this product really makes my hair smooth and silky without weighing my hair down. I just spray it on when blow dry straight... I need very little help from the streightner after this. Super job John Frieda!
B00ECFV33M|1|I'm not impressed. My mom tried this shampoo once and said it was great. After buying and trying it, I completely disagree. It is incredibly expensive for a small bottle. The shampoo doesn't spread easily on your hair and the smell is just ok. My hair is thin and a little damaged, and I think this shampoo did more to hurt my hair then help. After using this a couple of times I gave the rest to my mom because I thought she would enjoy it more then I did. A couple days later I got a phone call from my her saying she didn't know what she was thinking, this stuff is crap. I've used Tresemme shampoo that was WAY cheaper and much better. I would not recommend this product to anyone.<br />If this shampoo was significantly less expensive I think I would give it a better review, but I expected to get a quality product and unfortunately I did not.
