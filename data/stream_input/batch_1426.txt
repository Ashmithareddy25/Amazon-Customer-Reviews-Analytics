B004GUSG4M|5.0|I was not sure what to expect as the reviews have been mixed on this book.  I was pulled in from the first page.  This book left me wondering what each day would bring for the Christine.  I felt her confusion and frustation were clearly voiced by the author.  This book had many twists and turns that led me to a very different ending than I expected.  Great quick read.  I would recommend this to my friends.

B000002VMD|1.0|This album is overrated if not for the work of the sound studio, there is only one song that stands out and by now we all know what that one is.
B0014GJ08W|5.0|I ran across this album in 2008, just after it had been released. It was beautiful, energetic, and great. At the time I was browsing for some arabic/jazz mixes, and found this on a site, and immediately fell in love with her rich voice. She makes singing in multiple languages seem easy, all in one song. I love hearing more of her great music from Cafe Bleu to On Ne Saura Jamais, or C'est Bien Mieux Comme Ça. I enjoy having this playing at my office or at home. This album is definitely a keeper. Hope that one day soon, she comes out with a new album! If you enjoy a bit of international/world/jazz, then this album is one to make a part of your audiophile library.
0439023513|4.0|This one wraps it up.  Not the best of the 3 in the series, but a finish that allows you to get back to work.  Fastest read of the 3. Iif you have not read this full series yet, you need to.  MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE...very addicting once you get past the first 20 pages of setup.  Very addicting...after you read the first book you are thirsty for the last two.  just buy all 3...save yourself the agony.
B00753MBHA|5.0|Stalingrad described in one word: Brilliant! Love the fact that these guys can keep going with out Udo, Mark is an awesome vocalist and really adds alot of flare and a different perspective to Accept than Udo. This album really rocks hard, there isn't a bad song on the album and unlike most there aren't any filler songs. Personal favorites are \\"Hellfire\\", \\"Shadow Soldiers\\" \\"Revolution\\", \\"Twist of Fate\\" and my top favorite \\"The Galley\\". For anyone thats an avid Accept fan you'll hear the classic Accept style behind each and every track. And for anyone new to the Accept front as someone who owns over 3,000 heavy metal ablums somehow these guys always seem to make their way to the top of the pile. For under $10 anyone questioning buying this album doesn't know what they are missing for sure! Do your self a favor and pick this one up or download it today!!!<br /><br />-Frantic Foster \m/
819073914X|5.0|\\"The diary of a young girl\\" is a very good book. It is a diary of a real girl who with her family suffered through the Second World War. It all happened in Holland. It is sad, but also sometimes funny. It has just enough romance in it. Sometimes I could not be pulled out of the book. I think this book is for fourth grader's and up.

0062183591|5.0|Honesty is a strange thing. We nearly all believe there were honest and pious individuals, but everybody else has the feeling that leads them to lie, if only very minor ways. Few people can judge for themselves just how much of a liar they are. In many ways were the worst person to judge it because the person we most effectively lie to is our self. This book delves into where we lie, how we lie, and how much we lie.<br /><br />The author gets into it in one of his chapters, but just a tip from the start, whenever he starts to talk about how the experiment went you should write down or even just think about what you think the result was. As he points out, in one of his classes he used to give the results and everyone would seem unsurprised, until we started having them tell him what he thought the results were ahead of time and then people were more surprised by the actual result. Basically, once you're told what the result is you have a tendency to believe \\"Oh, I kind of figured that.\\" regardless of the actual result. You tell yourself a white lie to make yourself feel smarter by assuming that you would've been lead to the correct conclusion anyway. It's a minor thing, but I for one caught myself doing that several times. Fascinating how your own mind will try to trick you to make yourself look better, even when the only one you're looking better for is yourself.<br /><br />There several other experiments were also intriguing. I don't want to go into too much detail and spoil the book for you, includes experiments where they tested if wearing designer knockoffs (or at least what you think or designer knockoffs) might influence how much you a cheat on a test. The answer might surprise you. Seemingly irrational things can affect our brain in ways that reduce our honesty. Much detail is given how the controlled for variables leaving their conclusions to look accurate, at least so far as I'm capable of assessing.<br /><br />Other interesting ones involved how the length of time you have a relationship with your doctor/dentist affects how likely they are to prescribe unnecessary treatment and how creative people (or people in a creative mindset) are more prone to reason away their dishonesty with a creative story for themselves. This latter one I can personally attest to. I've a friend of a different political ideology and we like to discuss politics. I'll leave out which side each of us is on, because it's utterly irrelevant here and will just tick off half the people reading this. Anyway, he tends to have very strong feelings on things that he hasn't read anything about, but that appeal to his ideology. On a recent occasion, I came prepared with the massive number of facts, literally disapproved everything he had based his argument on, and I should've convinced him that on that issue he was incorrect. However he actually, and I am not exaggerating this for effect, said that he was not incorrect because he was using his own definition of the word \\"logic\\" and my position was weak because I had to use \\"calls to authority\\" (i.e. the dictionary).  Wow.<br /><br />I didn't get it at the time, but after reading this book I now understand that he probably wasn't being a jerk; he had actually deceived himself into thinking he was being fully rational and making a masterful defense that lesser minds just couldn't comprehend. It makes me wonder how many times I've deceived myself in such a manner and come off like a mental patient. Scary, though I console myself that I've yet to blame the English language for my being wrong.<br /><br />The book is sort of a light read, along the lines of a magazine article. The text is very easy to get through and there are some diagrams and pictures which eat up space as well. I think it's something like 250 pages as I recall and given the format you should be able to read the whole thing and maybe three hours or so depending on your reading speed.<br /><br />But what puts the book over the top for me is the detail. I've read a lot of other books where they talk about things that they did in their studies but they don't really answer all the questions. While I was reading this book every time I thought that there was some sort of exception that I'd like to see addressed, without fail shortly thereafter he addressed it. At times it was almost a little too excessive when he restated what each experiment entailed, but it was easy to gloss over those parts and invaluable to have them for reference when I did want to read them for clarification. I can honestly say that I haven't read a book on a psychological area that answered all my questions in that way. Bravo.he detail.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is entertaining fill with your favorite characters from ice age. Create the most fun village fill with bizarre animals. watch everything come to life. I definatly recommend you to play this game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I love the Bible. I love Jesus who is the Christ and blessed eternal king forever and ever Amen!
B005LALGCK|5.0|Love the easy source for facial reference.  Fantastic!  If you are an illustrator, this is a really great resource.  I highly recommend it!
B004EPZ03O|5.0|When I was a kid I watched Muppet Babies, when I was a little older I watched Muppets Tonight, and when YouTube was born I watched the old episodes of the Muppet Show.  I also watched the movies as well and they were good too!  When I saw this movie was going to come out I was very glad to go see it.<br /><br />It was great in theaters and on DVD it was just as good!  The jokes were great and all my obscure favorites were there!  Statler and Waldorf, Sam the Legal Eagle, and Gonzo.<br /><br />I loved the in-jokes, the songs, the dancing, the cameos made by today's celebrities, and even when they constantly broke the 4th wall I couldn't stop laughing!  The introduction of Walter was good and Jason Segle did an amazing job with this movie!<br /><br />I also loved how they made the Muppets more modern.  Miss Piggy's hair became a modern straight style instead of her usual curls, and she was shaplier the way a modern woman is.<br /><br />The ending as great too, I was hoping to see the Manamana again and we did!  If you liked the Muppets you've GOT to check this one out!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I decided to ignore all of the comments that said that your kindle fire locks up and got the app anyway. I should have listened. Yes the app itself is fun and addicting, but overall it is just not worth it if you have to shut down your device every time you use it. These farm type games always alert you every second and you always have to be on it, and then it takes way to much time to turn on and off your device.<br />Good app, bad accessibility to device. ONE STAR.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Especially with changing the screen to reflect an old fashioned air hockey table!  It's a blast on the Fire and great on my Thunderbolt.
1469984202|5.0|Great read!!!  Mr. Howey is now a new author on my radar.  This was a nice diversion and it makes you think.  The books have a lot of relevance for today, like never trusting those in charge who say they know what's best for everyone.  If you're reading this Mr. Howey, let me just say that I hope the story will continue on in the future.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|stupid app DOSE NOT WORK ON KINDLE FIRES dose not matter that it is free still stupid app didn't even let me go to main menu
B007SYWFRM|5.0|when you want to get out of the app, you go to the side menu &amp; press options at the bottom.. you know.. where it says store and stuff. &amp; then the exit bar will pop up. stop being so dramatic. you don't have to shut down your kindle, maybe you should just learn how to work it. by the way, other poleople who are thinking about getting it, it's a great free app (: it's very fun to play, no doubt about it :D have fun &amp; please read the top of my comment, it will tell you how to exit!!!!!! (:
B0061S0A64|4.0|This is a great concept and runs smoothly on the Razr. I know this won't be a go to app that I'll use all of the time, but it is definitely going to be a great app for relaxing and enjoying some quiet time.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Titanic is a Great Movie I own it on DVD and can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray!! I like the Uncut Version the Best!! I hope when it comes out on Blu-Ray on August 14, 2012 or in September it is the Uncut Version.<br />Dave
B004MYF4SS|5.0|This book is beautifully written, with a very good plot and very good rhythm.<br />I learned a lot about the island of Lewis and the story line was excellent.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell helps me discover memory skills and allows me opportunity to learn from mistakes by allowing a memory type pattern to solving the puzzle.
B003O2RQKS|5.0|I have been following Lang Lang's career for a while and watching how he has progressed.  I finally got to see him live performing Rachmaninoff's 2nd piano concerto.  Absolutely blown out of the water.  This DVD Blu Ray brings back that live performance that I experienced.  The man is impeccable.  Would recommend to any piano enthusiast.  He plays a beautiful Steinway \\"D\\"  Concert Grand.  I would give this a 10 star if that were available.
0596009208|5.0|I have been using Java professionally for almost 12 years, and didn't really need this book but thought it would be a good addition to my library since it was recommended strongly in several places/lectures I listened to recently. The style, contents, and flow are amazing. I would say that my experience would had been definitely a lot more enjoyable if this was the book I started with.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game if you liked the movie  Ice Age or if you just enjoy any type of design and build game
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the auto finish on the game. Glad I have the game on my kindle fire since it is my favorite game to play.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Not quite as good as the apple version...but still very good. Wish the top menu bar had larger buttons when finding passages.
B007R41E8O|4.0|I really like the way the hidden objects are incorporated into the game! Graphics are very nice also. Moving around the island gives a real freeing of &quot;moving around&quot; and finding your way. When you don't know where to go the arrows will point the way. The puzzles are quite challenging! (That's a good thing.)
0385341008|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read. It's hard to think of it as just letters as the individuals are written so vividly. I just wanted to meet them & give them a hug. What horrors they went through during the war is just so real & I know that they are true. Wonderful. I would recomend it to anyone.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I bought this cover for my kindle fire.  It is a great asset to my kindle.  It has a hard front & back cover that keeps it clean and protected.  It also has a little pocket on the inside for loose papers.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a really funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn game<br /> I love it. I can build houses and make families its just really fun even thkughit doesn't seem like it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great. I wake every morning and read a new message and passage. Its inspiring and completely worth it
B000001EKX|5.0|The bright yellow case on Kiss' sophomore album glows like a new sunrise over the land of the rising sun. It stands as Kiss' most distinct album and the cover art remains one of the most zany ever put out by a rock and roll band. This album comes off like a Fellini-led confetti party at the beach. It has that kind of quality to it. I'm not quite sure what the band was thinking when they released this thing, but it is a fun little piece of exotic rock and roll.<br /><br />The first thing you are likely to notice is that \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" sounds unlike any other album you've heard. You might be convinced there is water in your stereo. Rest assured, the album is supposed to sound the way it does. It is what gives it its charm. Some have mentioned that the new remaster still does not fix the muddy sound, but the muddy sound shouldn't be fixed! Believe it or not, it was intentional.<br /><br />Hoping to better capture the sonic fury of the band's dazzling live shows, Kiss went back to the studio with producers Kenny Kerner and Richie Wise to hopefully capture the power of Kiss on vinyl. The result was, well...this!<br /><br />It's fun to try and come up with possible explanations for how Kiss achieved this production sound. Some of my favorites include amps plugged into vacuum cleaners and play-dough in the guitar pickups. Feel free to make up your own.<br /><br />You may or may not find Kiss' second album becoming, but it does contain some classic Kiss moments! Arguably my all-time favorite Kiss song is on here - Let Me Go, Rock n Roll. The song would become a sort of prelude to \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\" and would serve as Kiss' first signature song of sorts. One that was fittingly co-written by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons together. Other favorites include Paul's electric power chord opener, Got To Choose, the almost poignantly touching Comin' Home, and the title track.<br /><br />THE PACKAGING<br />I think that Hotter Than Hell contains the most vivid and eye-catching CASE out of all the Kiss Remasters. The bright yellow is hard to ignore and really stands out beautifully against the album's cover art. Opening up the case, you are treated to a colorful combination of a reddish sunburst disc against Robert Conte's yellow colored essay. Flipping the case over, the fun simply continues. The famous photos of the group are reproduced with the song titles and running times divided by sides one and two (from the original album). All in all, just the case alone is a feast for the eyes. Very attractive!<br /><br />FAVORITE SONGS<br />My five favorite songs on \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" are:<br /><br />Let Me Go, Rock n Roll<br />Got To Choose<br />Comin' Home<br />Hotter Than Hell<br />Mainline<br /><br />Thank you for reading!
006197806X|5.0|This book was MUCH different than Delirium. And I must say, MUCH better as well! From the way that it's written, to the pacing, to the Thens and Nows. It also had that \\"page-turner\\" quality that reminded me of The Hunger Games...something Delirium was lacking in. I'm not one to go into detail with these reviews, so this might not be helpful as others, but just wanted to say that I loved this book and I'm (im)patiently waiting for Requiem.<br /><br />Whether you loved, hated, or in-betweened Delirium, I highly suggest you check out Pandemonium!
B0061S0A64|5.0|This app is by far the most entertaining thing I have played with on my phone in a long time, dare I say ever. Super easy to use, but very difficult to master( cliche quote, I know, but it's so true.)<br /><br />It's very fun just to mess around and scramble the notes everywhere, and heat how the sound changes. It really is an incredible app worthy of 5 stars.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|these guys are the best musicians ever.  I love their style and the selections of songs.  Check them out at YouTube, then you will buy>
B0061S0A64|5.0|I just threw some nodes on the screen and was rewarded with a pretty impressive beat.  I can't wait to play around with it and see what I can create (and a record feature in case I make something truly amazing.)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it! great for kids and adults alike. I like that you don't wait hours to do anything. it makes it quick and enjoyable.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|The best movie of the year.  George Clooney's beat work. So touching. A great family movie. Loved it from begining to end.
B00006CXXU|5.0|A big well done to not only Christina for making this wonderful album but to Linda Perry who helped co write a lot of the songs on the album and wrote the song Beautiful on her own and produced it on her own and Linda also helped produce a few of the songs.<br />I would say this album is a must have for all Xtina's and late teens to adults, children could have it but they might not like that kind of sexy sound that Christina has.<br /><br />1) Stripped Intro - I like that she uses into's and i think that this is really good but it would be better if it was longer, you might have heard this song as the opening video on the Stripped Tour 10/10<br /><br />2) Can't Hold Us Down Feat. Lil' Kim - I like this song it's a very empowering feminist song and i think all the females will love it 10/10<br /><br />3) Walk Away - This is the first ballad on the album and is really nice but maybe a bit too long and nothing new that will keep you interested enough that you won't skip it 9/10<br /><br />4) Fighter - This song is one of the best on the album it has more of a rock sound, Christina is shouting at one of her ex for a massive break up but in the end she isn't going mad or isn't insulting him she is thanking him for making her stronger and a fighter, a very catchy song 10/10<br /><br />5) Primer Amor Interlude - Although it's only a 53 second song it is pretty stupid and pointless why it is on the album she is speaking Spanish the entire way through so really it should only be included on the Latin version of this album 5/10<br /><br />6) Infatuation - This is another one of my favorites on this album and it has a Spanish sound to it i think mainly because she is singing about her ex boyfriend Jorge Santos and judging by the sound of his name he is Spanish or half Spanish, lyrically the song speaks about falling in love 10/10<br /><br />7) Loves Embrace Interlude - Again it is another short one but it's quite nice and sweet and it's good to go straight from this to LovingMe 4 Me 7/10<br /><br />8) Loving Me 4 Me - Ok song after a while i start to loose concentration 7/10<br /><br />9) Impossible - Alicia Keys helps work her magic on this gorgeous ballad 10/10<br /><br />10) Underappreciated - Nice and upbeat and has a good sound to it, kind of reminds me of Infatuation except Christina is speaking about falling out of love instead of falling in love 10/10<br /><br />11) Beautiful - We all no this one, a signature song from Christina and a fan favorite and even people who don't love Christina will have a little listen once in a while, it's empowering, beautiful and well sung 10/10<br /><br />12) Make Over - A really catchy song and one that will get stuck in your head for the day but it's a good song to get stuck in your head 10/10<br /><br />13) Cruz - My absolute favorite song on this album and one of my favorite from her career, i think another fan favorite and one that can out Whitney Houston any day beautifully sung and written 11/10<br /><br />14) Soar - My second favorite song of this album 11/10<br /><br />15) Get Mine, Get Yours - A nice upbeat song 10/10<br /><br />16) Dirrty Feat. Redman - We all no this song and it's music video, remember the one with the cut of trousers that shows her underwear, another one that will get stuck in your head 9/10<br /><br />17) Stripped Part 2 - A bit like the into. but shorter, still good though 10/10<br /><br />18) The Voice Within - It's 5 minutes long, might seem a bit long but i think it's perfect and it makes my friend cry everytime she hears it so a 10/10 from me and 11/10 from my friend<br /><br />19) I'm Ok - Really nice song and a very personal one from Christina 10/10<br /><br />20) Keep On Singin' My Song - Close to 7 minutes long, quite nice but a bit boring near the end 9/10
4770030088|5.0|Can't afford rosetta stone? this thing is a great alternative. most of it is romaji(roman alphabet) but also has kanj, hiragana, and katakana to help you advance as you go.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Powerful enough to let you make complex beats and rhythms, yet simple enough to let you have fun without any prior experience.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Just received this and listened to it.  Both my wife and I thought her voice sounds terrific...refreshed (don't get us wrong - we have always loved her voice, but it is especially fine here).  Won't get into the debate if Joe Henry's productions are better than hers...pointless in my mind, they all sound good!  Great selection of songs, super musicianship, excellent performances, and very nice recording.  What else is ther to say?  Get it, you won't be disappointed.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Throughly enjoyable reading. Had difficulty putting down these stories. Full of great details so you can picture it in your mind, and lots of action mixed with a romantic triangle.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy the speed of the game. Very enjoyable.<br />The graphics are good- card movement easy.<br />I would recommend for kids and adults.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  I couldn't wait to get the next book and loved how everything was answered in the last book.  I read all 3 books in 4 days.  Couldn't put them down once I started.  Loved it!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Adele Live at Royal Albert Hall DVD/CD is Awesome.  I watch it and listen to it over and over.  It is a great buy for the money.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The game is a lot of fun' but in the past two weeks it's locked up on me twice and when I go back in half of my items won't be ready for 3 days or more.  The other downside is you can only play for a few mins before you run out of energy.
1400079276|4.0|A tale of surreal coincidences.  This book is hard to put down once you get going, and it doesn't take long.  It's bloody, wild, with twists and philosophical tet-a-tets that elevate the story into a realm that is only rarely glimpsed in contemporary mysteries.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I think this game is really fun and that you need to use your brain 4 this game. also sometimes in my school we call the game chess black and white because of the colors.and the boys start to sing the song black and yellow. but instead of yellow we put white. this might sound boring because im falling asleep myself butbif you really think about it you might just see that chess is fun and  that you can do a lot of fun things with chess.<br />P.S. the only thing is the game does not have any instruction so ifbyou do not know how to play chess -then I concider you tine out hownto play or don't play thx
B0061S0A64|2.0|greetings fellow amazonians I was so excited to try out this app I love to dance and would like to use this to cut the rug in someplace other than my house. so I downloaded and was playing with it as I waited for the bus when I saw a wedding reception starting at the hotel across the street. I felt what better a place to try out my new moves than there. so off I went I was a little underdressed since I was wearing my dickies work shirt and pants while everybody else was in black tie, but I just swung by the bar got myself a gin martini and started making my rounds. I had a nice base groove going in my headphones when I decided it was time to show off my skills.<br /><br />bam I hit the dancefloor and I started with the robot, then the running man, the sprinkler came next followed by the worm and I finished up with the humpty dance.<br /><br />when I was done I looked up and everybody had this horrified look upon their faces. apparently I started my dance just as the bride was starting to dance with her father. she looked at me with tears in her eyes and asked why would the janitor go out of his way to ruin her big day. next thing I know her two older brother take me out the back door and toss me into the dumpster. thanks amazon for helping me destroy a young girls bid day.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game comes pretty close to perfect for a casual puzzle game. It has almost everything this kind of game needs: Beautiful but not distracting graphics, a wonderful soundtrack, and levels that slowly get more difficult, as well as a decent number of achievements. The only thing that'd push it even closer to perfection in my opinion is a backstory (as hinted at in the &quot;making-of&quot;), but that would just be another layer of icing on an already irresistible cake! Worth every Penny.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wont lie at first it did give me the vibe of Twilight. But being that I am a fan of the series I really didnt mind it because it turned into this hot, exciting sexy story I wasnt expecting (I bought the book without reading the book). But once I began reading I just couldnt stop. I felt connected to Ana in such a crazy way being that my I wasnt aware of all the different types of sexual acts you could participate in, not to mention her clumsiness and anger towards being given gifts. It was her sense of smart, independent yet loveable charm that got me into the book. And of course theres Christian, the not so easy to love, sexy and crazy for crazy sex that captivated me as well. I know someone like him, and that was what kept me focused to finish the story and see where it would take them. 20 pages or so before finishing the book I had bought the second book. Im excited to see what happens next hoping of course they stay together and find a steady compromise for both their happiness.
1451673442|5.0|This is the book that is the icing on the cake to The Secret.  Simple, easy to understand for anyone.  Actual daily activities to change your life in 30 days.  Do NOT read this book unless you are ready for some life changing experiences.  I highly recommend it to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun to play.  Easy for anyone.  Just like cards except faster.  I added it to my mom's apps Aldo and she is a big fan as well.

B0061S0A64|4.0|I just downloaded this and tried it out. Worked well and got a nice beat and groove going. I let it go for a bit (about 10 minutes at most) while browsing the web on my desktop. All of a sudden, my phone alerts me to a low battery. It went from probably about 80% to 15-20% in that 10 minute period.<br /><br />I like the ease of use; it was simple enough to figure out how to get it going without a tutorial or walkthrough. I like the patterns produced, the fact that the groove updates as you're dragging things around, allowing for dynamic changing of the pattern, etc.<br /><br />Just make sure you're plugged in if you're using it for more than a couple minutes.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I would highly recommend this app.  great..tons of fun...spider is amazing.<br />one of the best apps I own..download it now
B004XN3FHA|5.0|This flashlight is great for looking for critters at night.  It is light weight and runs on AA batteries.  The brightness and distance from which you can see stuff is nice.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Martin continues to surprise. The story continues in the most astonishing way. Hold on to your seat, because you will be jolted as you turn the pages. The only negative is that we now have to wait for the next volume.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|lovin it still buildin my hood up. gonna have the most poppin spot out chere soon just wait. come visit my city
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have tried several other Office Suite apps, and there are a couple of good ones. This, however, its my overall choice. Its cloud connectivity with Sugar Sync, Box, Drop Box, and Google meets all my needs, and the compatibility with my Office files has been flawless so far. It its aesthetically pleasing, a pleasure to use, and fully functional. What more can I ask for?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it the best game i like the games they make. keep  up the good  job wish you can make a star trak game
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is like farmville but with beloved characters and has mini games that are like fruit ninja its so addicting
B001E45XT4|4.0|Pros:  Comfortable, yet sturdy feel.  Sound quality good to excellent.  Microphone worked like a charm with minimal computer tinkering. I like the fact that the microphone can be retracted into the headset - good for storage.<br />Neutral:  This product is fairly large and has some weight to it.  Purely a personal preference thing here.<br />Cons:  Your ears will probably get sweaty.  Again, personal preference - it's an over the ear product and it's hard to avoid such a result.  After one hour of use, I have to take a break to let them cool down.<br /><br />Overall:  Great product if you can get it for under $30.  Premium product feel at a reasonable price.  Very close to a five star review - if I'm still digging this in a month or so, I may come back and bump the rating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was rivited by this book from the first page. My daughter was doing a book report on it and I thought I would give it a quick skim. I was incredulous at the dystopian world view and the thinly veiled warnings for those of us living in today's yurbulent times. Katniss Eberdeen is a true hero (not heroine) and I am happym my daughter has a chance to read something that may stimulate her political thinking. I admit I not only finished the book, but ordered the next in the series as well. Thrilling, thoughtful, and a portrayal of a young woman as a fully developed person rather than a sex object.
B0012HRJEA|1.0|This is Romeo + Juliet for the hipster with a short attention span.  I found the entire thing revoltingly full of itself and tedious.  It is without question the WORST adaptation I have ever seen.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The \\"trilogy\\" (sarcastically, as trilogy in my mind's eye is like The Lord of the Rings or something worthy of the title 'trilogy'.) Any-hoo...I do love a good sex scene to turn me on.  However it is entirely unbelievable that Anastasia has 2 orgasms every time they have sex, make love, whatever.  And they do it 2-3 times a day so... anyway, I have  a pretty good sex life with my hubs but us women know that the clitoris is a strange thing...if it gets too used to a certain touch it will take longer and longer to achieve orgasm, so you have to switch it up.  She comes just by his talking and touching her or by just penetration.  If this were the case, there would be healthy sexual marital relationships rampant in the nation with no complaining husbands that their wives aren't interested in sex.  We aren't that interested because it takes so long to come and it's so much work and some husbands just don't last that long!<br /><br />But a good story and good read.  That's all I have to say, not realistic in terms of female orgasms.  Oh, and can I have a billionaire husband and no appetite so that I never eat and don't gain weight?  Thanks a mil? (and don't forget about the 6 orgasms a day!!)
B006ZZC3D6|3.0|Almost cute and more challenging than it looks.  A decent app as a FAOTD but I don't think I'd pay for this.  There's a similar game available called Quell which is much nicer looking and sounding.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I'M STILL READING IT BUT THE NOVEL, LIKE ALL HARRY BUSCH NOVELS, ARE WELL ORCHESTRADED AND YOU HAVE FUN WITH HARRY, THE WAY HE IS, INDEPENDENT, SARCASTIC AND ALSO A LONER IN THE MIDDLE OF SO MANY PEOPLE HE FIGHTS AGAINST WITHIN THE POLICE FORCE. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYBODY WHO LIKE THIS KIND OF THRILLER
B0011Z8SHK|5.0|I'm not what you'd call a Deep Purple fan.  I know Woman From Tokyo and Smoke on the Water and Highway Star, these being radio hits from the band.  So I was throwing caution to the wind when I downloaded the entire album.  Luckily, it turns out that every single track is pretty darn good, solid classic rock.  If you don't know much about the group but want to do some rocking, this is a good place to start.
031261246X|5.0|For anyone who has any sense of computer technology or the security aspects surrounding it all, this book will scare the pants off you.<br /><br />Not only has Mark Russinovich written an absolutely fantastic story but has documented what could easily become every country's cyber nightmare if we don't start to sit up and pay attention to what's going on around us on the internet.<br /><br />It's difficult to say anything really gripping without spoiling the story, but if your fascinated by viruses, malware, spies and the digital domain then you need to read this novel right now...<br /><br />I guarantee you'll want to rush out and buy every bit of anti-virus software you can lay your hands on once you've finished it.
1575666286|5.0|Why do doctors seek alternative treatments other than conventional medicine when it comes to their own health or the health of a loved one? Why do the wealthiest people choose alternative medicine whenever possible? Because it works.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy!  I couldn't put it down.  This book is the first in the set, and it was just enough to keep you wanting more.  I felt like I could never learn enough about the mysterious Christian Grey.  Great book.  I would highly recommend it if you want one of those stories you can't quit reading.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|I think it is a copy cat of Mario! only 3 stars.It ls not very good but I like the all the cool worlds.
B005G02RIC|5.0|A beautiful sight (despite the fact that the released ArtHouse)!<br />Very harmonious singing, vigorous orchestra. With the crucifix in the shooting - it was probably too much drama,<br />but in general a very powerful production. All the performers were good, but I did not become a fan of Alvarez or Cedolinis,<br />but has become more respectful of Oren and Raimondi.<br />The work of video director worthy of praise, impressive scenery and costumes are good, but Tosca was sorry -<br />she had to drag quite a monumental dress.<br />The recording quality is excellent. Better than Turandot in Verona.<br />This Tosca great pleasure and I sincerely recommend it.<br />And, excuse me my English.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|great graphics, familiar characters, nice lay out, mini-games, and not a zoo theme! cant beat it! blah blah blah blah.<br />update** took off 2. *'s.. friends problem still not fixed, noticed star bar flashing then dropped about half inch, kung fu scrat minigame shows paid to play rewards as 100acorns, an animal, or 100,000 coins. I play it and will get 50 coins or 1 acorn. normally I wouldn't update a review but these are very frustrating bugs.
B0052GACNM|5.0|this is a great CD by wonderful artists and musicians. this man is still great at his age. wonderful listening to him.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|Season 5 off to a new start with some disconnect, jumping around a bit too much but still one of my favorite shows. This weeks episode was too good, how funny the fight between Pete and Pryce.  Really enjoyed.  Maybe the creative juices are again flowing.
1595825045|4.0|I really loved this art book. It has a great sampling of backgrounds, settings, character art, etc.<br /><br />For me, the only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because I would have liked more character art and sketches- though I concede that since ATLA was made digitally this wouldn't work out so well.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I would recommend this game to any puzzle lover. I LOVED the challenge that this game presented.  QUELL is SWELL!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Once again an  enjoyable experience! Thanks for the creative game! I was stumped a few times and had to go to hints,  but loved the thought process involved with this game.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Trashy, and repetitive, with not much of a story line.  I would not even put this on the shelf with the Mills and Boone books. would defiantely NOT recommend this book
B0073XORCY|4.0|This is not the long mega-opus that \\"TAAB\\" was. It wasn't what I anticipated, either. It's more an update than a sequel, and it's damned good. I'm not a Tullhead, really. I own a half dozen of their records and last bought a new record of theirs 20 years ago, so I don't claim to be an expert on the band's recorded history. I just know I don't have time or money for crappy records and I'm down with this one. Especially good is the 5.1 version.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A simple Solitaire game that makes playing the game a pleasure again. It's great to be able to play a card game without having useless bells and whistles getting in your way.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this alarm clock app! It's really effective at waking me up in the morning (Which I dread doing) and there are a lot of cool features. I mostly used my iPod before deciding to switch to a kindle app. It was super unreliable and for almost a week, I was waking up 1-2 hours late! I almost missed the bus a few times too... This app is awesome and I love the solving math problems feature. It really wakes you up! And I also like how you can set the snooze time (which you can't do on an iPod)
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is fantastic . would recommend anyone to buy it. level design is clever and the graphics are beautiful
0061122416|5.0|I have never known Paulo Coelho. I have never known about his works, never read one. My friend told me once about The Alchemist and I just ignored him and gradually, I forgot about it altogether. Then I went to this book store recently, looking for a new book to read, then I stumbled upon The Alchemist. I was like: why not try reading it this time. It's a small book and I was actually really skeptic on how good a small book like this could be, considering I was just done with Inheritance by Christopher Paolini. I read it and I was done. I regretted the fact that I didn't read the book earlier in my life. I regretted so much that I haven't known about Paulo Coelho all this time.<br /><br />Paulo miraculously write the book so that you would be immersed completely in the world of the book. The Alchemist was so fluid that you will hate it to have done reading it. You will want to reread the book and put it on the best-book-I-have-ever-read section. Reading the Alchemist, you will question yourself and your life. You will ponder about your very existence and your meaning in this world. You will look at the world and how you live your life differently, in a better way.<br /><br />This book is a self-improvement guide written in fantasy form. YOU HAVE TO READ IT. I have referred many of my friends to read it, and those who read it, are greatly grateful. They also refer the book to other friends. JUST READ THE BOOK.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|Really good music with non generic melodies and good harmony.  Nice to listen to different styles of music.  Both singers are really talented.
0060527986|4.0|WARNING: read The Alchemist first before reading this.<br /><br />Warrior of the Light is not a fiction, except for the introduction and the ending, but you will likely ponder about it anyway. It's a spiritual companion for The Alchemist, therefore after you have read The Alchemist you will need to read Warrior of the Light. If you have read The Alchemist, congratulations, you have joined many people, a community, that have had their view of life improved after reading it. Now you can go ahead and read Warrior of the Light just to enhance the way you will live your life.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|u have to go to the shop but insted just cilk on settins th bottom one it will let u get home good luck
0066621003|5.0|I bought this book because a potential employer recommended that I read it.  His company follows the Good to Great doctrine closely.  He is a very engaging man with humble beginnings, but who has risen high without losing his humility.  This book is mostly about people, particularly the RIGHT people, and how they make a company great.  I now know why he had me read it; so I could answer the question: \\"Am I the right person for this company?\\"  Fortunately for all of us, reading the book only made it more clear that I was.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious about how good companies become great, and stay great.  You may be surprised by what you learn!
B0030ZRW9E|4.0|I love Agatha Christie but especially Hercule Poiroit. His character and her descriptive workings of buildings and people into the narrative helps you get a feel for the time period in addition to enjoying a mystery.
B004N622EY|5.0|One of my friends recommended I read this book and I wasn't dissapointed. It's is brilliantly written and am loving the second book of the trilogy.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|every time I open the game everything takes 10 days to be ready and  I have no energy. good game before that.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This is a great album.  Lots of songs that seem like they are traditional, and some are old enough to hark back to the roots of folk songs and rock and roll.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this game a lot. I have it on my phone and kindle. I like to play it every night before i go to bed.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Love this group.. they have the freshest sound w/ peaceful but playful overlay. I want to play all their songs at once, like gobbling up a handful of peanuts but better yet, I choose the slow enjoyment of licking an ice cream cone and savoring every sound. Please keep on creating magic You Monsters and Men!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I watched the series on instant video because of prime membership. If you can, watch that first. The whole series was a great ride! Nice surprise!
B0078YW95K|4.0|Really liking the series one day and not the next.  It has been up and down IMHO.  I'm still waiting to get seriously hooded.  I don't think that the Julie love triangle is doing anything for me, though I really like her character.  The bartender is hot!  So - perhaps Hulu this before deciding if you are in or not.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the title pretty much sums it up. I love all the different games.really great for all ages no matter how old.
B007H63I1I|5.0|I have a stressful job - seriously.  Coming home and watching Once Upon A Time is a refreshing highlight - a cocktail for my mind for about an hour.  An escape.  This episode was like the rest - consistently good.
1416955070|4.0|This will be my very first book review!!<br /><br />City of Bones by Cassandra Clare<br /><br />The Good: The best part is how within a few pages you are sucked into the story! I stayed up WAY too late doing the `one more Chapter' thing till the wee hours of the morning. There are a few nights I woke up mad at myself because I fell asleep with the book laying on the floor next to me and that means<br /><br />A.) Lost my page.<br /><br />B.) Stopped reading it because sleep took over.<br /><br />I love how complex the book became as I kept reading and I love the depth of the Characters.<br /><br />I know a lot of people that were in love with Jace. I go to a book club once a month and we decided to read this series. Everyone was in love with Jace, except me. I thought he was too cocky and sure of himself for being as young as he was that and I'm not a fan of cocky personalities.  I personally am rooting for Simon. I love nerd boys. HA HA!!<br /><br />The Bad: There were a few things that bothered me about the book. I did not like how Clary walked ALL over Simon and he let her do it! I'm sorry, that isn't REALLY a friend. The other thing is Clary is a main female Character in the story. I wanted to see her actually defend herself against the demon attacks and help Jace, Alec & Isabelle out in the fighting. She just seemed to cause a lot of the problems it seemed. I just wanted to see Clary step up to the plate and become a heroine.<br /><br />Other than those small things it was a great book! I would recommend it!<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars<br /><br />To Follow me on my blog go to my page<br /><br />[...]
B0073IGGCI|5.0|I love the fantasy and escape aspect of this serious.  My husband even likes it.  It's violent enough, yet girlie enough to appeal to both of us.  It's also quite clever.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I loved this series I couldn't put the books down!!!!! The series is so worth every penny I paid for it.
B005HXGE9G|2.0|Some cools stuff, but \\"In Your Eyes\\" is so cringingly cheesy, it sounds like it is a PBS Fundraiser like the Irish Sopranos, or the Three Tenors. I have everything Gabriel has done, but am finding each new album less and less of a want.
B004P4KMSC|5.0|We bought this truck for our 2 year old grandson.  He absolutely loves it.  The doors, hood and tailgate open and close and are very sturdy.  We will be buying more from this manufacturer!
1455523003|3.0|Love Hitchens. Miss him being in the world.  Had been wanting to read this for some time and finally received it as a gift.  I would have liked more dirt as it has to be there.  I kept thinking I would read about her knuckle-bumping with the elites - eating great meals, staying in five star hotels - super fine toilet paper to wipe her ass... while pretending to have nothing herself.  Really, who would want to own the yacht and have all the problems of ownership if it is always at your disposal free of charge?  Maybe the doors containing the intimate details of MT's day to day life were closed to Hitch being who he was... The shortness of the book earned it another star, as it was over before being completely a drag.  The  Albanian political section was confusing and I would probably need to read it again to understand how it relates to MT other than her being Albanian.  Overall, I am glad I read it as I am now prompted to research her deeds further, and be prepared to enlighten anyone who feels she deserves their adoration.
B003O86FMW|5.0|See title. Definitely on my top 5 of best novels ever.  A smidgen violent but surprisingly clean otherwise. I wish there were more than 3!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I actually read the whole series.  I loved the plot line; however, I wish that more was included.  I realize that it was present and first person view. Spoiler Alert...Skip to next paragraph. One of the things that really bothered me was the fact that it was never told exactly how Peeta helped Katniss while they were separated during the Hunger Games (Did he tell them she had a obscure talent? Did he lead them away from where he thought she'd be? Did he see her traps or even her and go a different way?).  I know Katniss did not know at the time; but she was forced to watch a review of the competition and the writer just flew right over that.<br /><br />  I also watched the movie and my only true issue with the movie was the scene where Katniss climbed the tree.  I felt that it made her a more cowardly character to run away rather then invite her enemy to come join her.  I liked the spunk in her invite; I felt that scene was had more spunk in the book then in the movie, which was truer to the Katniss that was built in the book.<br /><br />  Over all the series had an excellent plot line.  Very easy read. I feel like elementary children could read with ease, though I do not recommend in for such young children because of the content.
B0064JV4LU|5.0|This film is fantastic on so many levels, emotional, hilarious, thrilling, and more than I can tell you. See it! I just stumbled across this gem at a local film festival in Kansas City. One question. When can we get it in Region 1, so I can tell all my friends to get it?
B003V4AK8E|4.0|Absolutely love this controller.  It feels great in hand with a spiky textured almost rubbery plastic for your palms.  Great battery life easily outlasting my original PS3 controller.  There is a small dead zone with the joysticks, so not a great controller for playing FPS's.  I use this mainly with non aim specific games such as NBA 2K12.  The rubber on the joystick has been my only issue.  It's torn and left edges of the plastic it covers.  Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying since I like all my peripherals to be in very good condition.  I probably would buy another one if they fixed this flaw, but for now i'm going back to my PS3 controller.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is wonderful I cant stop playing its a combination of my faveorite movie and the Sim type game! if u get this game u wont be sorry it will have u playing it for hours!
B00785P2QC|5.0|me and my little boys have a great time playing this game.  great way to spend time with them. they love adding trucks and buses.
B000JIHP88|5.0|We bought this a month after our son was born and he has progressed from:<br />1. gazing at the animals with the mobile off (probably looking at the bright colors)<br />2. visually tracking each animal as it moves in circles.<br />3. talking to the animals.<br />4. grabbing at them and laughing.<br /><br />He is now 3 months old and this mobile is a lifesaver for me. For instance, when I need to take a shower in the morning, I place him in the crib with the mobile on and I have at least 20 minutes to get back to him. When the mobile turns off automatically, he will let me know. The only thing I don't use is the remote control. Overall, GREAT product.
B000B8QG22|5.0|I like Robin Williams movies. This was a good one. I love watching Sargent Major Dickerson get his comeuppance, after what he pulled. What a worm!! Robin Williams was the perfect choice for his role  as Airman DJ Adrian Cronauer in the movie.
B005VR9328|5.0|If you don't like this disc, I gotta ask again \\"Why not\\"? Roots has set the table so others can feast. They did a great job of setting the table, here. Some may complain that are too many short songs on this disc. Okay I'll give you that in a sense but, only because I just can't get enough of this band/rap group. I listened to it  for a few days and nothing else. The\\"Redford Suite\\" if added altogether they would equal one or two cool pieces of music. It was broken down in to parts but, I agree that it could have been consolidated in to one or two movements. Still, good stuff, though. What I got from the rest of this disc's collection of works, is that there is a lot or individual concepts being played out musically by the members who have formed a very cohesive unit. This collaboration of individual ideasism is good for them and us. That gives them weight with me. I know this is usual for them, though. Songs like \\" One Time, \\"Kool-On\\" and \\"The Otherside\\", among a few others that are on hit to me.  Are song songs that can stand on their own. I have to say that there is plenty of great listening here.<br /><br /> \\"Lighthouse\\" is a hit, and watch out for the other cuts too. Because the same can be said  for the cut \\" Tip the Scale\\". \\"Tip the Scales,\\" which is a \\"gotta stay on the grind\\", typical type of slow jam. Yep, it works for the group again. There will be many cuts for people to choose from on this disc. That's a good thing. So get your ears on full with this one. Your ears will love ya for it. Firgured, I'd  help wet that appetite for the rest of the songs on this disc.  For a group that keeps raising the bar on itself, this worked out really good for me \\"The listener\\".
B003ELKNH2|5.0|I have seen this movie before, but I was at a much younger age. I wanted to get a better perspective on it now at 60 yrs, I am able to understand the movie. Enjoyable to watch.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Mark puts his experiences and wisdom on paper in a fashion that is fun to read and very informative and helpful.  Great book for anyone striving to do better in life!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game with good graphics and not too much prying for your money. gets more fun the longer you play it.
B0061S0A64|5.0|this app is sooo dang cool! especially if you are in a creative mood or in to IDM. very relaxing I sat here for hours playing around.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a fun game to use to kill time... i mean at the airport or in the car but they really need to 1 lower the cost of the games or 2 give out more points
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|I don't care if they loved it at Cannes.  I thought it was a lousy movie.  There is some great music and some great scenic photography, both of which have no connection to the story which I could discern.

1423140591|5.0|Percy Jackson has no memory of his past at all except for the name Annabeth.  All he can remember is the last 8 months.  But something is drawing him to the hills around San Francisco.<br /><br />What he finds there is Camp Jupiter, a Roman outpost in America.  The inhabitants are made up of demigods like himself who swear allegiance to the Roman side of the ancient gods.  They base their camp around Roman military outposts and the even have a Roman city where they can retire after serving the required number of years.<br /><br />Percy arrives in mid-June and quickly finds himself falling in with Hazel and Frank, to demigods near his own age with secrets in their past.  The three of them are sent on a quest to free Death so that the monsters the demigods kill will once again die.  Will they live long enough to succeed?  What will the cost be to the three of them if they do?  And will Percy ever remember who he is?<br /><br />Since Percy is going through what Jason did in the last book, I was worried that this one would feel like a retread.  It didn't because we know Percy's backstory, so watching him regain it was actually interesting.  Of course, the plot follows the familiar lines we've had in all these books.  I'd like to see a little deviation from the formula, but I do still find the formula entertaining.<br /><br />And it allows the characters to shine.  I love Hazel and Frank as much as I do the other characters in this universe.  Even some of the periphery characters we don't get to know as well are great.<br /><br />Then there's the humor.  While all these books have some laughs, I feel like this is the funniest to date.  I especially loved a section set in the headquarters of a certain major website located in Seattle.<br /><br />Those who are ready for an epic adventure will enjoy this fun series.  The latest book is another great offering.
B0073U2FB2|1.0|It's one thing these days to be bombarded with great looking CGI laden effects movies at the multiplex, but Chris Gorak's \\"The Darkest Hour\\" is something else, the CGI that this movie relies so heavily on is bad, it's not cheesy fun bad, it's just real bad. Every year it seems one of these type of C-grade shlock escapes and hides in the movie houses, in 2010 it was a little cinematic turd called \\"Skyline\\", in 2011 it's \\"The Darkest Hour.\\" You may know these types, then again if your lucky or just smart, maybe not, these are the kind of movies with tawdry special effects and poor scripts which you wouldn't watch on the Syfy Channel for free, let alone shell out some hard earned greenbacks for.<br /><br />The movie just plain looks awful, not just the poor effects, but bad editing, a static camera and some poor lighting don't help. The script by Jon Spaights, from a story by Spaights, Leslie Bohem and M.T. Ahern, is so paper thin that you could be forgiven for believing the actors are just running around shooting at things or running away from things without the benefit of having any script to follow, this is one of those movies they edit more than they direct. The cast is mostly capable, Emile Hirsh, who's career seems to still be reeling from the flop that was \\"Speed Racer\\" a few years back, Olivia Thirlby, so good in \\"Juno\\", and Max Minghella do the best they can with these flat, uninspired, one-dimensional characters, who you don't even particularly like. The late George C. Scott used to say that the way to judge good acting was by the joy the actor has in his performance, these kinds of movies live or die by their standards of fun and these actors are having no fun, there is no joy to their performances.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that doesn't get screened for film critics in advanced, in fear that people actually listen to film critics and don't see bad movies, fat chance. I know this because it's listed on the Darkest Hours's IMDb page under trivia, as though the filmmakers and/or distributor of this movie are proud of it, then again, I suppose that may be the most interesting thing about this turkey. I don't want to say anymore, I have already wasted too much of my life on \\"The Darkest Hour\\", but one thing I know is that I had no fun here, not a minute, not a moment, not a second of enjoyment, I left with a headache. However, just like the surviving characters of this movie, and possibly the actors and filmmakers, I feel like I survived an ordeal.<br /><br />Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very similar to zoo story and mixing elements from tiny village with the characters from ice age as a boost. liked the minigames and tge theater. great way to promote the upcoming movie.
B007Q476KU|3.0|Stephen Spielberg's \\"War Horse\\" comes with a lot of expectations, as does any new film by Spielberg, but also like far too many of his movies it falls just short of it's full potential. Told in an epic and episodic form, this movie tries to reach back into the past of cinematic wonders like those epic spectacles that David Lean was so famous for. In many ways, this sort of ambition is doomed to fail outright, few filmmakers today can pull this off, but Spielberg should be one them. So, the real trouble I would guess lies in the story, it's too epic for the movie that was made.<br /><br />The movie begins with an excruciatingly dull first quarter, filled with bland characters and cliched situations we've seen since the dawn of the cinema. I don't want to sound bloodthirsty, but the movie doesn't find it's footing until we get into the war, once this part of the movie begins the epic journey and adventures soon follow, this is where Spielberg is comfortable. The bulk of the movie is rousing and thrilling, but it's all undermined by a finale of such gross sentimentality and \\"a you've got to be kidding me\\" reunion, that I could hear chuckles, at least in my head.<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" is beautiful to look at, gorgeous photography by Spielberg's long time cinematographer Janusz Kaminski assists the movie greatly. A fine cast of great British character actors (Emily Watson, Peter Mullen, David Thewlis, Liam Cunningham, Benedict Cumberbatch) populate the supporting roles, but make no mistake the film is about and rightfully belongs to Joey, the war horse of the title: neat trivia, Joey is played by the same horse who also played Seabuscuit a few years back. Add a rousing score by John Williams and as expected, this is one well made movie.<br /><br />The story based on Michael Morpurgo's book is long, drawn out, rather sad, and I doubt the audience intended for this, that being the family film audience, will have the patience for this. I have very conflicting feelings forthis movie, on one hand it is big and glorious to look at, and on the other it's too long and too slow, too uninvolving. I guess one's enjoyment for this movie will depend on the viewer.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|This game takes up so much memeory on kindle fire that i deleted every othrr game or app and it still didn't work. I just wasted $7. Please fix this Gameloft
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. mainly just a time waster. but if it is free what more can you ask for.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|All l can say is I'm glad I didn't waste the money for a rental. And waited 'til I saw it free on tv. Whoever did the dancing, that was the most captivating part. Everything else has already been said. Shallow, incongruent, over-the-top and unneeded sexual scenes, but I guess the producer had to offer something to give 'adrenaline' to this movie in the absence of acting that was truly a stretch and brilliantly done. There was an opportunity here to make Nina's character a multidimensional and complex woman who was relatable in some way but totally, completely fell short. Although I've enjoyed Natalie Portman's acting in the past, I find it a sad commentary on our society and Hollywood to give this or her, an Academy Award, while not expecting better.<br /><br />If this were the first movie I saw with Natalie Portman, I would never want to watch another movie with her in it. The one dimensional act - far too boring. It's a good thing I know what she is capable of. I only hope she doesn't slide on this one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|me and my son be on this game evereday just about. I like the sushi game where you gotta stab the wishing with chop sticks as fast as you can. bomb.
B005I6EVUG|3.0|I just bought this cover for my kindle fire.  I have enjoyed it and it is a real nice cover but I didnt expect it to scratch so easily.  I now have a scratched cover and am now ready for a new one.  Disappointed.

B0061S0A64|1.0|the title says it all. it sounds cool and all but if ur like me on an optimus s dont bother downoloading it cause its a waste of time and space.
B000002NJM|5.0|Another genius of a movie soundtrack. Lots of great soul music, plus gems from Johnny Cash and the Grass Roots thrown in for good measure. Of course there are the snippets of dialogue from the film interspersed with these well-chosen tunes. The grand result is something close to sheer bliss. How can anyone fail to be pleased, and even inspired, by such a great collection of tunes? Listening to this soundtrack always makes me smile ... and sing along!
B005NKGEP2|2.0|Am interesting story, wordy , lacking pace and suspense, slight twist, I was bored, I did keep reading for I was curious of the end , it wasn't worth the trip
B002NEFL8W|5.0|The battery grip makes the 7d look and feel like a pro full frame slr.  Added battery is nice, the weight helps balance a zoom lens much better, and the added controls are very handy.  Great addition to any SLR.
B004QL7K8E|5.0|Being in my early 40's I haven't been to a party myself for about 15 years. And I suspect the people who didn't like this movie were never in the party crowd anyway. But ask yourself; isn't this really similar to the major-destructive party in John Hughes' SIXTEEN CANDLES? It's just a modern version of that. Does it get a little crude and sexist at times? Yes. But it IS just a movie - not an instructional video. Yes I am aware of the movie copycat parties that resulted in property damages and multiple arrests too. So this film and the arguments for and against it I'm sure will go on for some time. Personally I loved it! The kid in me couldn't help but smirk and laugh out loud. Can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can watch it again. sorry haters. :)
B00457WZEI|5.0|I loved the book war horse.The fact that the story was told through the horses perspective gave the story an exciting and different approach to the story
B005ERWYH6|3.0|After hearing the title song, every song sounded like the previous one. I saw her sing on the awards show and hoped<br />the CD would be more of the same. I was disappointed after hearing all the titles since it was too much of the same.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|super fun!<br />the kids really enjoy it! the mini videos are very cool! easy to play! fun for all ages!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|An excellent first season of the Game of Thrones. While it highly sensationalizes the sex in the books, it stays true to some of the finer points of the series and Sean Bean delivers a spectacular performance.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Intriguing puzzles and a beautiful interface keep you engaged, but don't tire you like some action games.  Well worth it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Love the books but EL JAMES has to try to find more syllables to some words she tends to repeat over and over again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great read.  Compelling, creative, and so engaging.  It stays with you. Hugh, I am filled with admiration for your work.  Keep writing!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Simply can't get enough of the series and the characters, very witty, funny and thought-provoking, although sometimes it only takes a few minutes to understand the enigma and the plots, and no need to be psychic :))
B007MNV5WU|5.0|ok this is a grate game and I love it but I literally just bought it yesterday and beat it pluss I went to school!I begged my dad for it and I have angry birds seasons anyway it was too easy I mean come on they need to put more worlds
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a fantastic science fiction series.  The author keeps the plot constantly moving.  It may be sci fi, but its not a huge leap to imagine something like this really happening.  Five stars to this author and for this book.  He is now on my favorite author list!
B002NTAVPA|5.0|This is a great collection of Elvis' gospel music.  We get a peek at his soul in his heartfelt delivery of music from his youth.  I am touched when I listen to him with his gifted voice roll out this music of God.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game. my kids love playing and learning the responsibilities of taking care of things. I highly recommend this game for children.
B006X8GFBQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading Blue Remembered Earth. I think it is a solid Reynolds novel, but with a novel point of view. It works both as a standalone SciFi suspense novel and, presumably, a prequel to a more epic saga. The main characters, Geoffrey and Sunday, are both interesting and likable and following their journeys within the Solar System was good fun.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Yes, because it is a matter of historical record, we know how this one is going to end.  What's fascinating is the tale told along the way.  King George VI is suddenly on the throne, due to his elder brother's abdication, and Europe is on the brink of major war.  He hates public speaking, and stutters severely.<br /><br />Not flashy, but high production values.  This is a characterization-driven film.  The more lowly-class speech therapist, Lionel Logue, is brought in by George VI's wife to help her husband.  Gradually, the two learn to respect and trust each other in ways that count.  There are moments of wry interest.<br /><br />It is indeed an unusual topic for a film, but everything in this tale holds together well, from plot line to characterization, and historical relevance.  Highly recommended.  And, as one who hates public speaking on the job herself, I certainly empathized with King George VI from the get go.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I first heard of this book on Good Morning America, they were promoting this book as the best book for women/ mommy porn.  Then I read an article about the book in the paper so I decided to give it a try. I read all different genre of books.<br />The book is written like a harlequin romance, moves at a snails pace, strings the reader along with chapters that add nothing to the book, weak story, boring characters, the author repeats sentences from previous chapters,and a theme of D&S sex.  I did finish the book, mainly because I gave Amazon my money and felt  maybe it would get better as I read.<br />My advice is to wait until it is $.99 !
B000B7QCKO|5.0|I enjoy all of Yanni's music, but I love this CD.  I had misplaced my original CD, so I had to replace it.  I will be making a backup copy for myself so I will not be without this CD.  If you like piano music, you will love this CD.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The only way to exit the app is to shut down my Kindle Fire.  So for an app that specificly says &quot;Kindle Fire Edition&quot; .... I am dis appointed... but once that small wrinkle is removed I am sure I will love spending hrs playing this game. I love Ice Age. so I am sure this is a fun game.
B004A8EI9M|5.0|This show has a low-budget feel to it. I mean that in a good way. Aside from the zombies (which are certainly not low budget), it is filmed rather simply in rural areas which certainly capture the atmosphere of the south (e.g., that the characters always seem to be slightly sweaty). The pacing is on the slower side, especially in the first season. However, I find that part of its appeal, as it is really a post-apocalyptic drama more than anything. The characters and their conflicts are well developed and make the series worth watching. I would call this show a fine balance between good writing, artful acting, and zombie killing adventure. It is my new favorite show.
B005H45INI|1.0|This is not even a movie.  It is a scam to get money from people.  The whole video is comprised of some dumb, lunatic wannabe guy making faces, screaming, etc. in front of a video camera for an hour.  The people that sell this scam crap, lying and taking advantage of others should be made to shovel cow dung with their hands for about a week.  DO NOT buy this dvd!  I hate I even had to give it 1 star......maybe I can leave it blank.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app the graphics aren't hd but they are pretty good, there's so much to do, so much customization. it is my new favorite app.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|What makes this movie amazing is its realistic. I'm thankful and feel renewed. This movie has made a positive impact in our lives.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awsome for everyone to play its so wonderful i totally love its graphics and every thing its so totaly cool i love it
B0052UZIFA|1.0|zero, can't install on my Galaxy II. and yes I check on unknown sources. And customer service just gave me the solutions I already tried.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|please lower the price of this game I would love to buy it but its WAY to much... ill buy it if it is like $1.99
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|This is an awesome movie. The first was good. This one is even better. I have watched more than 5 times within 2 months.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I wondered if the good reviews were just fake but no, this thing is amazing on my Kindle Fir. I play guitar and totally plan to use it in my recordings. wow!
B0061S0A64|5.0|I don't yet get the controls, but it seems pretty fun. You can mix and combine different beats, then swipe the screen like a keyboard. Pretty fun.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun and easy to follow. The movies are of good quality. Charactors are funny. Don't show to your children or they may take over.
B0061S0A64|3.0|dont buy if you have the g2x/optimus 2x. just crashes back to menu. this sentence is just filler to meet review length requirement because i have no idea what program is like
B002ZG980U|4.0|I wasn't sure what to think after seeing the previews and hearing descriptions of this movie.  I'm not a huge science fiction fan, but this didn't really feel like a science fiction movie.  It was a bit confusing, but enjoyable nonetheless.  It was an intriguing concept..going into someone's dreams to plant an idea to benefit someone else.  That idea gets more complicated when you add the layers...a dream within a dream within a dream, and the potential to be stuck 'in limbo.'<br /><br />With every layer added, it was a bit more difficult to keep up (I'm not completely dense, but we DID watch this late at night and it is a LONG movie!).  I will probably watch it again, since I'm sure I missed a few things or didn't quite understand them.<br /><br />This is a long movie--and it felt long to me, but I still enjoyed it.
B0061S0A64|2.0|I'm using a kindle fire. it doesn't sound great and its hard to use. Maybe I didn't give it a chance?
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game.  its Sim city meets the Oregon trail. I recommend it for anyone who wants to have a game they can come back to every few hours.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I must admit, the title was not appealing to me..it sounded very cliché indeed. As a matter of fact I did by-pass this title on my quest for a good work-out book. Interestingly it was the recommendations from other books I searched that made me take a look at it. This book just wouldn't go away.<br /><br />I eventually sampled it and was convinced from the get-go that this was the book I was looking for. It was straight forward, clearly written, it did not attempt to BS me into anything that was \\"NEW\\" and improved. It addressed all my questions and more!<br /><br />It took two days to read and I use it as a good reference point for diets, routines and supplements.<br /><br />So far so good, whether or not it works for me is not an attribute of the book but my application of it. In the mean while, I got my answers and have material that I feel cuts the hype and mystery out of basic exercise principles. Exactly what I was looking for.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|Before seeing this movie I was biased because of my infatuation with George Clooney, but once I actually viewed it in it's entirety, not only was he absolutely wonderful, but the actors who played his children were so believable - WOW!! I totally enjoyed this movie and felt empathy for the main character.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I have seen many of Gary Oldman's films and the man really intrigues me. He is probably the best character actor of our day and yet he does not seem to get the better films. Regarding this film, the story was a bit confusing - too much going back and forth in time. If I could say anything to ALL actors and actresses of today it would be \\"Take diction lessons!\\" Everyone speaks in whispers with marbles in their mouths. This is the reason I love older movies - movies of the 30's, 40's and 50's....one can understand everything EVERYBODY says. I had to turn on the captioning to understand what was being said in this film. Jeez!! I will continue to watch Oldman's perfomances but this was not one of his best. In fact, no one was worth watching in this film.
B005COO1X6|1.0|If I ordered this it was never sent to my iPad? As a rule Amazon is very prompt and orders are handled correctly.
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|My title says it all. I had the mystery figured out at the beginning. The acting was atrocious, although the character Lisbeth was intriguing. I like Christopher Plummer very much but he had so little screen time. The sex between the 2 main characters was unnecessary and dull. The mutilation of the cat didn't fit in the story. I'm sure the book was much better. Don't waste your time. I bought this one but will toss it to where it belongs.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I played and leveled up several times.  Built a nice villiage and bought several animals.  Good quality graphics.  BUT... there is no easy way to exit the game.  No main menu, no X-button, no home button.  I found a &quot;back-door&quot; exit by following an in-game ad web-link.  Please update for Kindle Fire to allow us to stop game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|people said it didn't let u go back to ur home screen that's wrong this is wat u have to do...to to stuff,then go to options andbthen u can go right 2 ur home screen ...u welcome
B0061S0A64|2.0|Good for wasting ten minutes of your life... I'm not a musician.  I don't want to be a musician.  Unless this thing will play the POTC or Star Wars themes, I have no use for it.<br /><br />I'll keep it because I have a 5 year old who's easily amused.<br /><br />This ap is okay because it was a FAOTD... I'm glad I didn't waste cash on it.  It's not worth all the glowing reviews.
0439023513|3.0|This book just wasn't as good as the first two.  Important situations weren't explained until they were over and important characters just kind of disappear without explanation.  Just not nearly as good as the first two books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book series were the best books i have ever read in my intire life. the way suzanne collins captured the way katniss' life was absolutely brilliant. plus the way she mixed love and battleing for their lives was amazing. i look forward to the second movie (cathing fire) which will come out in 2013 i believe.<br />  - and may the odds be ever in your favor
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Mario bros. feel.  Easy controls.  Silly characters. and pretty graphics.  Since it was free I like it even more!  my young sons enjoy it as well.  Its a good distraction while killing time.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|pretty fun game, wish you could refill energy with coins collected in game, not just pay for refills.  friends are kind of a pain to get too
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|after installing this app my kindle crashed and now my screen view will not rotate and is stuck lengthwise. this sucks!!!!!!!
B00701QVVY|5.0|I was a big Overkill fan back in the late 80's early 90's; up until Horrorscope basically. Then I started to listen to other kinds of music and did not keep up with new releases from Overkill and other thrash bands (I still enjoyed their albums that I owned). Lately I've been buying new releases from some of the bands I used to like during that period. Quite a few are very good (latest efforts by Sodom and Testament come to mind) but Overkill is the best. I liked Ironbound a lot but EA is even better. No a weak song on this one! Read other reviews for more details but if you're like me -- a thrash fan that has been out of the loop for a while -- there is no better way to reacquaint yourself with the music than getting the Electric Age!
0345529057|4.0|Great books, but too small for my old eyes, I wish I had money for Hardcover version, but this was so much cheaper.<br />Exiting series, very recommended.
B0055SWM08|4.0|decent unique game. has a few interesting tweaks in higher levels but it dose get a little repetitive.  nice graphics. calming music. def worth a buck!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a really fun and great game to play. I also liked how I got to get this game app for free.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found this book, as well as its two sequels, to be a very provocative sexual romp.  The storyline was OK but a little draggy at times; however, the sexual action was almost non-stop!  It almost read like a sex manual because it touched upon areas I never heard of before.  Nonetheless, I couldn't put the book(s) down.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This app is unique and fun to work with. I also give the dev extra high marks for adding a setting to change from portrait to landscape mode. The case on my 10.1 screen tablet doesn't do portrait mode very well. Wish all development would do this.
B008359JXI|3.0|Why do we need to care that Betty is fat, when we all know January Jones was pregnant?  Why is she still on the show?  Cheap.  And boring.
B00422LESO|4.0|This was a nice easy read. This a modern romance story with the setting of Jane Austen's, Pride and prejudice. The main character Jane, who is a 30 something educated woman who is disillusioned about men. She's been waiting for her Mr Darcy all her life and when her great Aunt Carolyn dies she leaves her a 3 wk vacation to \\"Austenland\\". This place is where she can live out her Darcy dream and than get on with the real world where there are no \\"Mr Darcy's.<br /><br />This story is one I think we all wish we could vacation to. I liked the premise of the story but a little confused about all the snippets about past boyfriends. I get the info but some of it didn't make sense to me. That is the only reason I rated the book 3 instead of 4 star. I would definitely recommend this book. I think that all Jane Austen fans dream about this kind of vacation. (less)
B0061S0A64|5.0|fun! easy to use. I spent a half hour just playing around. my five year old loves it too. great FAOTD.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I think this game is really good it does get tough if you do not have nonlinear friends to help you complete the tasks though
0670023329|5.0|This book is wonderful!!!  I hope it becomes a movie.. it's almost described as the Hunger games without the \\"games\\".  The West has no idea what atrocities are being committed in North Korea.  I could not stop listening to the book.  I cried many times during this book.  Everyone needs to read or listen to this book so we can have the world make this terrible dictatorship known.  This is far worse than any information that is being taught in our schools.  Everyone needs to be aware and understand this terrible regime and start condemning  the US's current lax policy towards N. Korea.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|these are the favorite kind of games for my kids. the love thistle one and say it is much more fun than they thought it would be. its a very fun game and worth playing. my kids range in age from four to ten and they all enjoy this game.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|the editing is GREAT,  but I can only edit pics from facebook Cuz it wont let me upload a pic from gallery!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This game works pretty good, not quite as easy on my kindle as the game I use on my computer.  Sometimes the matches do not always click right away, but it is pretty good for the road.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|best city/ville game ever buy it if you want to have some fun and laughs :) have some fun buy it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|games perfect and not just fer learning I think this is a great game for kindle fire its amazing for all ages
1423140591|5.0|I loved this book. Can't wait to see how well the Romans and Greeks work together. I loved it way to much. Also can't wait till The sea of monsers comes out in 2013.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I received Quell during the free app offer and so intrigue and challenged that I purchased Quell Reflect.  It offers that same type of interesting play.  I cannot wait to see what Fallen Tree has to offer next.
B004S5C8WG|4.0|Don't be put off by the tame start, open your mind and let the story unfold. I was mesmerised by how the story went from Eastenders to the High Court. It may be fiction but I feel we can all relate to being the underdog.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is trashy and not worth reading.  I got about 20 pages in and quit reading, then deleted it from my kindle and computer library--not a nice book at all.  I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Wish I hadn't spent the $10.00--what a waste.  I heard it called \\"Mommy porn\\" on the news today.  Guess that's why I quit reading early in the book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|works great, lots of options including Vegas, 3-card draw, 1-card draw, etc.<br />can also deal a guaranteed winning hand.<br />nice game.
B000P0J09W|4.0|Excelente pelicula, es de las que yo catalogo como infaltable en cualquier coleccion. Una de mis peliculas favoritas de mi infancia. En cuanto a este DVD, pues nada, excelente calidad, Audio en ingles con sus respectivos subtitulos en espa&ntilde;ol. Lamentablemente las caracteristicas especiales del mismo no tienen ningun tipo de traduccion, solo audio en ingles. Sinceramente nunca jamas entendere como es posible que a estas productoras les cueste tanto trabajo colocarle un simple subtitulo a todas las caracteristicas de un disco, sabiendo que esto no le resta absolutamente nada a la calidad del producto en vista a que un subtitulo solo pesa unos cuantos kb. Cuando sera que se daran cuenta que en los estados unidos hay un mercado gigantesco a ser explotado de habla hispana. Nunca lo entendere.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Absolutely addicting...purchased the trilogy and finished all three books in only a week for the three books...amazing read... and no....the movie is not overrated!
B00425S1H8|5.0|Cables are great, but if you don't have the USB, you'll never tie into an up to date system. Don't make the mistake of forgetting to get this. Shipped nicely, works perfectly. You have to have it if you want to view your tele on your laptop. Glad I read another review that reminded me to get this!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely addicting...purchased the trilogy and finished all three books in only a week for the three books...amazing read... and no....the movie is not overrated!
B007UMLE5Q|5.0|I don't want to put too many spoilers in the review, other than what I put in the title, but if you have been a long-time follower of Pete Campbell's brand of smarmy and have wished to punch him in the nose, since he got Peggy pregnant than this is the episode for you. Even better if you have loved the quiet, fortitude and practicality of Lane than the enjoyment quotient goes up even more.<br /><br />In the fifth season, we have Don married to a young woman, though he seems to have learned from past mistakes and is trying to be faithful and truthful - quite a feat for our Don. Lane meets and English compatriot during a soccer game and has a chance at the Jaguar account. Pete and others are nastily doubtful of Lane's ability to land the account on his own and take matters into their own hands, or rather than experienced hands of the employees of a whorehouse. Don sits this one out wryly at the bar, informing the madam that it is a busman's holiday for him as he was raised in 'a place like this, though of course it wasn't as nice and we called it a whorehouse'. Even without the showdown between Pete and Lane, the episode would be worth it for that line and that scene.<br /><br />Mad Men continues to be very good to brilliant television as we follow Don and the others through their lives and the turbulent sixties and seventies. I hope the show and the time jumps make it possible to see Don and Sally in the eighties having a really honest conversation about everything in the family and the century. A five star episode of a five star show.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Dont. Waste. Your. Time.<br />This book is terrible. The writing is more for the level of a young adult reader yet the topic is not. I felt like true to the form of a porn movie,nothing really transpires during the non sex scenes. I think this book may be for people who have very uninspiring love lives and wish for more for themselves.

0938045695|5.0|First of all the product is excellent. Highly recommended for anyone just starting out with kettlebells. Even better, was the fact that it arrived on time, and in the condition advertised. Great transaction!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|the game was awesome but allot of the stuff was really expensive, and really $20 for only 450 acorns more like 650 acorns.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think that the games are pretty cool.  It brings me back to when I was a kid in a way.  needs more graphics.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i'm so glad this is a free app. it makes me think of mario as i am playing it. this is a super fun game and is easy to control.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am an adult that prefers young adult books. I really enjoyed this book. It is a very nice quick read. I highly recommend it.
B0061S0A64|1.0|Force close. I understand my prevail isn't a powerhouse but the app should at least run like a turtle with the overclock rather then just force close. Disappointed
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the first half of this book. I thought it was kind of a cop out that they had to go back. Much of the fantasy aspect (which I enjoyed) was lost when the characters started to act more realistically. But it was overall a good read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Got this because it was free.  Its simple, fun, and has cute characters.  The control buttons are in a weird spot,but you get use to it.
B0061S0A64|5.0|this app is amazing it is totally worth the two bucks i see myself spending hours just messing with the beats
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I admit- I wanted a book similar to the Fifty Shades trilogy and found Bared To You via Maryse's Book Blog-- this book satisfied me and then some (dare I say, even BETTER than Fifty Shades??)<br />Its heavily focused on Eva and Gideon's relationship which I loved - I hate books where there is wasted time/fillers. Really arousing scenes and intensely great characters. Eva is a sexually liberated character (but of course has a troubled past) and I could easily identify with her strong female character -- this isn't some simpering virgin who could be any faceless woman much like other romance books, Eva has character and oomph! Gideon (ohmygawd) is realistic and yet the ideal male. He is a fantasy come true!<br />This is the first time I've read anything by Sylvia Day, but this book guarantees she is on my author watch list - I will be browsing her other books. I can't wait for the next book! Bared To You is something to be treasured and reread when a woman needs a lazy day to mentally retreat! YAY Sylvia!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books are not going to win any awards but they are still fun to read with an interesting story that I will be recommending. Newly married Ana and Christian are still haunted by the ghosts of Christians past. Christian is still struggling with some deep ingrained issues but its nice to see how far he has come. Its also nice that Ana still at least tries to fend off some of the larger power play Christian tries to pull. Some obstacles try to derail their happy ending and the conflicts from the previous books finally come to a head. Overall a fun enjoyable read and series with some darker undertones.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|annoyingly engaging. fun to play for short periods of time, otherwise it gets frustrating if you cant win...<br /><br />I would suggest this game
B000SEFCD8|5.0|Wonderful book! It really give you a new way to look at your dog.. Or maybe I should say it makes you realize how great dogs really are.
1416549447|5.0|This is a great book with a whole new way of approaching running.  Some of it I intuitively have known and practiced.  A lot of it is a completely different way of \\"practicing\\" running.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app use it almost everyday. and for sure every Sunday at church. pastors notes are all ready posted on there to follow
B004UID2LC|1.0|its a virus I have a anti virus app and ir reported that this app was malicious I recommend not getting this
1455510319|5.0|Here's what I can say:  read everything you can get your hands on that Michael Connelly has written.  I promise you that if you like the genre, you'll love Connelly. It's great stuff!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How a book like this made it to any best-seller list is beyond me, but I guess the dumbing down of America is flourishing.  Besides the fact that it is pure drivel with a mendacious and pathetic supposed interaction between a Mr. Perfect type and a Ms. Spastic type, complete with unfathomably inane dialogue that relates to nothing in the real world, it is also so far off the reality screen that I believe the average person cannot connect.  Nor in my case does he care to.<br /><br />Pure, helpless blather.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I am half through with Secret Daughter and can hardly put it down. It is an interesting profile of mixed race marriages and adoption.  I can't wait to finish it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I couldn't stop playing. this game is addictive. I was a fan of the ice age series. game is as fun as the series
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This a beast game. You get to play with with the angry birds and the two blue birds from Rio. Instead of vrsing pig you vrs monkeys and save birds.
B0061S0A64|5.0|NodeBeat is a musical application that allows you to create music by placing \\"nodes \\" on the screen. You then move these modes to where ever you'd like them to be & the musical notes will change. There are so many different settings you can play with that'll change the tempo, rhythm, pitch, speed, beats, number of nodes, etc.<br /><br />When you've perfected your NodeBeat creation, you can then allow it to play while you record & then save it to share with others via Facebook or email or, just keep to yourself.<br /><br />You can either, listen to NodeBeat play by itself with it's  never ending & always changing music or, create your own musical NodeBeat track to save & share with your friends. Maybe, even make a cool ringtone!<br /><br />I'd been exploring NodeBeat for 10 to 15 minutes and I was having SO MUCH FUN experimenting with the settings and then,......POOF! My colorful creation had suddenly morphed into a black screen before bringing me right back here to the app download page!<br /><br />*I'm updating my rating to 5*-Stars because I know the developer is working hard at fixing the Force Closing issue & will put out an update as soon as there is a fix. =)<br /><br />5*- Stars
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is so great. You get to build your own town. You also can shoot animals and help problems Like a wildnfire and stuff. You can also choose to be a girl or boy but I don't know if there is any difference because I chose the boy. Anyways this game is great and free.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I FOUND THIS TO BE A VERY INTERESTING VIEW OF LIFE THRU THE EYES OF A DOG.  BEING AN ANIMAL LOVER IT GIVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT OUTLOOK AT HOW DOGS VIEW THEIR OWNERS AND THEIR FEELINGS.  ANIMALS ARE VERY SMART AND HAVE SUCH AN UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.  VERY PERCEPTIVE CREATURES.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|downloaded this app for my four yr old without realizing there was in app purchasing. my account was charged over 35 dollars.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The game is very interactive and offers hours of fun play!<br />Similar to Super Mario's or Sonic the Hedge Hog. My daughter's love it.
B0061S0A64|5.0|NodeBeat is not a sequencer or sound station, nor is it comparable to music creation programs of that ilk. It is, however, the most intuitive and fun music experimentation app on any market.  As a producer, I find this app is great for overcoming melody related mental blocks. My only qualm is that I payed full price for this just a few days ago. Runs great on Kindle Fire. For those looking for a true musicians experimentation app, I'd suggest chord bot.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game so cute! easy to play and fun to build. I think it is great for all ages if youu like to build cities!
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I am very impressed out my curse of created such a good app they are getting better and better I have a feeling there going to be better than google
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I had been lusting after this box set forever, but it was just too expesive. But low and behold, one day it was a gold box special! I could not purchase it fasr enough! Hooray Amazon for making this dream box set affordable!!<br /><br />DVD and Blu-Ray discs and a beautiful book are included, as well a a commerative box.<br />If you are a Sound of Music fan, you could not ask for anything more!
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Paired with an AMD FX8120 and 8GB Ram. Running Windows 7 64bit and everything runs smooth, with no issues so far. Highly recommended.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Ethereal and trippy!  Watch it eat away your free time as you experiment with your own ambient soundtracks.  Good times :)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The game is great on my kindle fire.  No problems and a ton of fun.  And you cant beat the price - FREE!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|The Iron Druid Chronicles books are an absolute treat for any fantasy reader.  They are filled with fascinating characters both human and godly.  Kevin Hearne makes them all completely believeable with their flaws, foibles and heroism.  There is plenty of really clever humor along with fast-moving, exciting action.  I can't wait for the 4th book in the series.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was not sure when I started the book I would be a fan.  I thought the writing was a little corny.  I thought Christian was over the top and too good to be true with all his wealth and amazing good looks.  HOWEVER, I got sucked in to this love story. It truly is a love story and one that many can relate to.  We all may start relationships with a set of rules, maybe not rules like Christian Grey had, but rules nontheless. But rules can be broken with matters of the heart.<br /><br />I think there is a certain audience for this book though. If your not a mature adult who has been through the inevitable challenges in life with relationships, this may be a little too dark.  I don't think teenage girls should read this, as the sexual nature of Ana and Christian's relationship might seem scary or perhaps leave a young person with thoughts they don't need to be aware of.<br /><br />I just started the second book and can't put it down!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read on average about 1 full length novel a week, year in year out, for at least 2 over decades.  This is on top of my reading for my work, my reading for investments, my general blog reading, and other miscellanous reading.  I am lazy by nature, and this is the first time I have bothered to write a review of a book in over ten years.<br /><br />That should tell you, without unnecessary superlatives, that this book is excellent in near every aspect.  The last book that left me with such a good feeling was Life of Pi by Yann Martel, and I was too lazy to review that!<br /><br />Get it, read it, and let a brave indie writer bring joy to you.
B0061S0A64|5.0|The possibilities with this are virtually endless. Whether you're musically inclined or not you can make some awesome beats, melodies and harmonies using this. Well done.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is just like Mario and I love it it has different features from mario!!! it is a great game if you like Mario or Mario kart
B006W0QOF2|1.0|This movie was awful so predictable my 10 year old figured it out. and what could have been done in 30 minutes was drawn out for an hour 47. it's basically the same story line as every louis lamore book but with out the entertainment value.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The third in the series was not a dissapointment. All three books kept my attention. Read in the proper order and you'll be well rewarded.<br />Lisbeth Salander and Micheal Blomkvist are two great characters that play well off each other.<br />Stig Larsen died too young. Great writing potential lost to the world.<br />Also watched all three Swedish movie versions. Much better than the one in theaters now, Even with sub titles.

B001DJ7PQ4|3.0|purchased brand new and came with 2 broken buttons that hold the discs in. 2 of the discs will not stay in place so every time you open it the discs slide around. As for the season 4, it is okay. not ask good as s2 or s3.
B005K17RU0|2.0|doesn't update when I set it too. its just constantly on or wont turn on. needs a percentage chance for when its gonna rain instead of just a temp and a pic. I mean come on sometimes I need to know if it might rain or there's def gonna be a down pour.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love games that involve creation and involvement. This game satisfies both.<br />You will always have something going on in the game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun to play games and unlocking new ones to play! I also like how they give You a bunch of rewards like when you keep trying to beat a game they give you like five thousand coins! and the firstbtime you reach one hundred coins they give you a big reward for that to!
B003EYVXVE|4.0|There's little point in recapping the plot, so I'll instead move directly to the critique.<br /><br />As sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen we'll first forgive the voluptuous Jennifer for looking strikingly well nourished though she must poach for food to keep her family from starving. If the setting for your story is as police state where starvation is only a bad-hunting day away, then such a radiant girl in a very expensive looking, well fitted, leather jacket isn't selling your story. Director Gary Ross makes the mistake (the first of many) of telling us how desperate the people of the outer districts are, but he doesn't show us anything that looks nearly as bad as the actual poverty in many parts of our country now.<br /><br />All at once Lawrence is an issue and an asset. Her round, soft cheeks should look gaunt and sunken, her curvy, filled-out body should be thin and lank, she can't pass for starving or 16 years old. That said, she can act. The intensity displayed at the reaping when she takes her sister's place, when she tells her mother she has to keep herself together or Gale \\"Don't let them starve.\\" You feel everything with her. Her best moment is just before the games, in the last minutes before stepping into the tube that will take her up to the game field she is not just shaking, but she is scarred out of her mind, it's so convincing you feel it in your gut. Her acting saves this film, even as her looks damn near kill it.<br /><br />Above all it's Director's Gary Ross's inability to convey tension or menace, to wrap the audience in peril and bring much needed suspense that drags the film down.<br /><br />Once in capitol city the film quickly drags, becoming sucked up in it's own leisure when a sense of urgency is required. There's many nice, small touches, like the way everyone likes to skit around the fact that all but one teenager will be savagely murdered, or the way drunken mentor Haymitch, put's his hand over his glass to keep it from being refilled, a subtle way of showing he's taking his role seriously. Unfortunately it's all for the paces, get out the information from the book and move on. There's the obligatory montage of training that is completely pointless because it feels like an obligatory montage which is just the way a lazy writer/director get a large chunk of time covered when it wasn't important to begin with.<br /><br />Many scenes lack power. When Peeta picks up a hundred pound weight, for example, and throws it over head into a rack of spears the rack should blow apart and the result should be dramatic and attention grabbing. Instead you barely see the impact, the rack just moves and some spears fall off, painfully non-climatic. Latter, the cornucopia sequence -- a bloodbath that claims nearly have the tributes is only seconds long, shot fast and blurry lacks any depth or sense of brutality or horror, and I'm not asking for gore, I'm asking for some emotional connection with the characters other than Katniss, a look, a couple of words as the kill or die that relates the terror of what's happening.<br /><br />No matter what happens there's no foreboding, no sense of danger. This film should have all the tension of Die Hard but instead it's a safe, by-the-numbers film.<br /><br />Possibly the most unforgivable thing is the non-relationship between Peeta and Katniss, the final moments in the arena should scream Romeo and Juliet (they are specifically referred to as star-crossed lovers) rather they could be eating cake than poison berries. Lawrence constantly looks like she's trying to coax emotion from Hutcherson, when it's supposed to be him who's truly in love here. She looks longingly at him with depth and sincerity, he stares back blank.<br /><br />With all that's wrong it's really Lawrence's show here and she carries it on her back well elevating a standard movie adaptation and making it her franchise. But Director Ross misses the point entirely, he's hand-held shaky cam is just annoying inthe forest, and the other scenes are static and empty. Just like it was good to kiss Chris Columbus goodbye from Harry Potter, so will it be to bid Ross a fond farewell.<br /><br />This film's only really good as it relates most of the excellent novel and because of Jennifer Lawrence's performance as well as it being the primer for the second (and possibly best) of the three books. Otherwise it's too soft, too glossed over a film and it lacks tension and depth.the forest, and the other scenes are static and empty.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Let me just start by saying that I am reviewing the entire trilogy and I am not going to provide a synopsis only my opinions.  I began reading the trilogy because I was bored and I could not find any other books that interested me.  Once I started reading the series I could not put it down!  I was a little nervous at first due to all the references to the BDSM in previous reviews.  But let me just say this- yes there are BDSM elements to the story but they are not overwhelming or abundant.  I will say that I had a love/hate relationship with Christian during the first book.  I would hate how he was treating Ana one minute but the next minute he was my dream man!  Yes, there are an abundance of sexual scenes in these books, they ARE romance novels.  However, the author does a good job of not being too graphic or describing them distastefully as some writers tend to do.<br /><br />I have read many different kinds of romance novels, from the \\"barely there\\" romance scenes to the outrageous \\"in your face, I can't believe I'm reading this\\" one.  This trilogy has to be one of the best, well-written, all-consuming romance novels I've ever read!

0307956350|2.0|The writing is good, the lead character, Kate, is an ex-CIA agent turned housewife, recently transplanted to Western Europe and her day to day travails of an American adjusting to life in Europe ring true. But the 'spy' plot and the intrigues involving the suspicious couple that befriend her and her dweeb husband, turn so slowly that you feel like you are moving backwards, plotwise. The 'secrets' are ultimately revealed, not through action and plot, but through the stylistically dull revelations of explanation, at the very end. Waiting (and wading) through this book with the expectation of some interesting plot developments; it all comes together in the end in a flat narrative.<br />Granted, it was not a cookie cutter formula book. Given that the author seems a step above that, he should now figure out how to let the story happen through action, rather than narrative postscript. Disappointing.<br />For a far better example of intrigue and good writing with real movement, try Stone's Fall, not new but memorable in a way this book won't be.
0312944926|2.0|I was expecting something better from Dan Brown... It's just so ridiculously amateurish that it gets implausible to believe. Just a couple of things.<br /><br />A. You just don't make changes to a publicly available encrypted file and expect to get away with it. That would be the equivalent of me replacing the Linux kernel with my own backdoor and expecting the technical community to lap it up! And of all people, the top cryptographers and software writers in the NSA actually thinking they will be able to pull it off. Really, an average CS graduate will be able to figure out that a file as important as that cannot be trusted without an accompanying hash.<br /><br />Secondly, in the last part it's pathetic how the main protagonist (Susan) who heads the cryptography division has a tough time figuring out that the \\"element\\" referred to in Tankado's message can be looked up in the periodic table. It's surprising she takes so long to figure it out.<br /><br />There are many such implausible \\"facts\\" in the book that they want to make me laugh. I think Mr. Brown would have done better had he taken a security consultant on his team.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I will not add more praise to the superbe storyline of this set, it is all here.<br /><br />I want to express my disappointment with the chapter indexing and access to maps.  How can you index chapters with roman numerals, only,  but have character names with no corresponding roman numerals for each chapter?<br /><br />Amazon is supposed to be at the top of it's game for one-touch ordering, but you have to touch at least three times to pull up other bookmarks and even more if you want to look at a viewable map of the series?  I realize that Amazon is not the publisher, but they should be assisting with content presentation with publishing houses to get a satisfactory product.

B0052VUNHC|4.0|I thought the book was good and I read it in a day, but I felt like it lacked in character depth and development. I would have liked to have heard more about Pidgeon's (Abby's)past that lead up to her fear of Travis. I felt like the love between them was frustratingly juvenile at times, but the book was still really good.I would have also liked to learn more about America and the feelings of the characters outside of how they felt about one another.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love adventure type novels. I Love Stephen King, Dean Koontz etc. This is the best book I have read since \\"The Stand\\". This book is much deeper than you might think. Don't be fooled by it's popularity with the younger crowd. I am 60 years old and read all three books and saw the movie. I enjoyed the books so much that I am reading the first one again, something I have never done before.
B0055SWM08|5.0|the game is very easy at the start but it does get harder. i love the music! I don't like how on the kindle fire it resents the game back to the title screen if I change the volume.

1594744769|3.0|Like most reviewers here, I was highly intrigued and excited to read Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children. The design, the cover, and the story all promised something new and exciting. Perhaps I anticipated too much? My expectations too high? But the book fell short of the spectacular, eerie, next-to-horror I believed it to be.<br /><br />The idea of the story is phenomenal. The use of vintage, authentic photography to inspire the characters is a brilliant idea! However, both were attacked and accomplished at a novice level.<br /><br />This would probably be a fantastic read for a much, much younger audience. I am an older generation who enjoys diving into a good YA fantasy, and I can recognize that my expectations may have been too high. However, after the first chapter Riggs loses the unique voice he developed for the lead character, Jacob. As more characters are introduced, the uniqueness and definition between character, plot, and setting get completely blurred. At a certain points, I literally had to go back and remind myself who was speaking. The voices were not individual to the characters and they were wildly underdeveloped.<br /><br />I also felt a little cheated at how rushed and thrown together the end of the book seemed to be. Especially to come to an end without resolution. I appreciate that it was left open for the series to continue, but felt all the action of the book had been saved for thirty pages and was so condensed it almost read sloppily.<br /><br />I will say, it was a fun and very fast read. I would absolutely recommend it if you're not looking for anything too heavy or mind blowingly exciting. And I will say again, the use of the photography was just brilliant. It created a connection to the book and the characters that otherwise probably wouldn't have existed for me. Definitely a book for a much younger generation of readers.
0345803485|5.0|I was suggested this book by a friend and I hated her for a while because I could not but this book down!!! I stayed up late and squeezed every moment I could find to read this. I am not usually into the story line but this one grabbed my attention from the start. Every word luring me to turn the next page until I had finished this book in 48 hours, which if you knew me is a shocker(It takes me at least a week to finish a book)! So yes I would suggest you read this!!!!!!!!!!
0670023329|5.0|What a coincidence to find this book after having just read Hunger Games. Throughout the experience of Hunger Games, I repeatedly wondered how anyone could conjure up such a harsh world in which people were driven nearly mad by hunger. Camp 14 was therefore a complete shocker...an education into the world of North Korean encampments in which thousands of 'classless'victims continue to experience not only the relentless hunger but the resultant ravages of an entire victimized and extraordinarily isolated society.<br /><br />My first jaw-dropping moment occurred when looking at the maps at the beginning of the book...which give you an idea of the enormous size of the encampments, and the vast terrain over which Shin (the escapee) traversed (mostly by foot, despite horrific injuries sustained while pulling himself through high-voltage fencing) before he even made it to the U.S. You can, by the way, see these camps via Google Earth.<br /><br />There were many other moments of astonishment in this book...which other (Amazon) reviewers have described well...but I think the most astonishing is that Shin is alive, continuing to work through his psychological demons, and focused on raising awareness of the plight of so many who suffer terribly while remaining relatively invisible to the world. As the author points out, without the means to get in there for video documentary (with the requisite star power to boost the cause), it's difficult for us to turn our attention and hearts in that direction. Moreover, Shin points out that there's danger to those still held captive in that increased awareness may result in total anihilation of the camps and associated extermination of all the victims.<br /><br />The book leaves me frustrated about what to do...but I'm glad I read it. I could not put it down once I started.<br />Most of all, I wish Shin great success in his life and future endeavors and thank him very much for sharing his story.
B0061S0A64|5.0|the only thing that would make this app better would be to allow the music to run in the background. seriously awesome app.
B005PTYOTE|2.0|I have DVD version of all three movies and was really disappointed that the sound quality is the same.  I also cannot say that visual aspect of the movie is much better. So if you own DVD there is no reason to buy this set - it is waste of money
0307959856|2.0|I didn't like the book for a couple of reasons; first being that the P.D. James had Kitty staying at home when it was explicitly written in the original that Mary alone remained at home. Kitty's marriage was alluded to by her character maturing, away from Lydia to her very material benefit. Being a sister in law of Darcy's made her a huge catch in spite of having no fortune. That was a huge problem.<br /><br />She changed a few characters in her book, which was not what Miss Austen had written. Charlotte would not have acted spitefully. Also, she would not have been privvy to information about Mr. Darcy's impending engagement to Elizabeth. Charlotte and Mr. Collins were not in Darcy's confidence. However, there was someone who had already shown that he couldn't keep his mouth shut and was Darcy's confidante; his cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam. That's who leaked Darcy's plans.<br /><br />Also, having Colonel Fitzwilliam's brother handily die left no heir to Rosings. Colonel Fitzwilliam would have married Anne, Lady Catherine's daughter. That issue wasn't brought up, either. Plus, he suddenly didn't grow a brain or a temper. He was a colonel in the British Army for years. He knew how to command sensibly. His portrayal in the book was not true to form.<br /><br />I felt the story was sloppy and piggybacking on the finely tuned story of the Miss Austen's writings.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just like good old super nintendo :) could get very addicting. i've only played a couple levels so far. I'm interested to see more.
0061122416|4.0|Alchemist<br /> For quite some time I was told about Paulo Coelho's book \\"The Alchemist\\".  Quite a few folks described it as genius and many told that it changes the perception of the world. However, when I was asking about the books genre, nine out of ten wouldn't give me the answer. Therefore, just recently (mostly out of curiosity) I have read it myself.<br />Paulo Coelho's \\"The Alchemist\\" is a great story of a young boy, Santiago, who is on a journey to discover his Personal Legend that consists of travelling the world and discovering new things. In his adventures, Santiago faces many complicated situations which get in the way of his path to obtaining his goal. However, Santiago is not easily deterred and knows that, while difficult, the path to discovering his Personal Legend will lead him to great success. By accepting the omens of fate, listening to his heart, and following his dreams, Santiago is well on his way to discover his Personal Legend and the true meaning of happiness that applies only to him. Overall, The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho, is a fantastic read that emphasizes the art of obtaining a goal and that the true value of that goal comes, not from the treasure and rewards at the end, but from the knowledge and experience gained through the journey. It is a must-read book and is great for people who are looking to find themselves and fulfill their own Personal Legends.<br />So read it, but do not take this book too seriously. It will not open you the secrets of the universe and the depths of the human soul. It just reminds you that you have always known but, somehow managed to forget again.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game reminds me of pioneerville but the quests are easier to manage and don't stack for pages.  The only thing I don't like about games like this is the whole energy concept that stops the game while I'm still trying to work
B007L6VQ68|5.0|Mesmerised by the choreography between the pin-point dialogue, the sumptuous eye for detail within moving frames of worn scenes and the sounds of music, birds, cases and delicate places. I was hooked from beginning to end.<br /><br />There were so many potential pit-falls set for this production but it easily avoided them all. Originality saw to that. Terence Davis made a film; he did not film a play. I hung on every nuance. It was as though I lived those times.<br /><br />I loved the swings and shifts, for there was so much room for understanding to come in and settle down by the fire. In the Public House or the Underground. In the past or in the present. Individuals getting along with each other.<br /><br />And this aching country reflects its leaden subjects. Judges and landladies avoiding the rest. Sophocles would be out of his depth.<br /><br />For American audiences the time and place depicted can have little if any resonance. I would still recommend The Deep Blue Sea if you watch it in the dark with a good surround sound system, no, there are no whiz bang special effects but the soundtrack will put you there. It is a beautiful movie. You might say it's full of class.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|its so amazing and addictive. its so great on the go I love it. its so fun and its one of my favorite apps.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games) had as much thrill and spark as the Hunger Games original novel. I thoroughly enjoyed book 2 and cannot wait to dive into book 3. Highly recommend the series! Love it so far!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this app is great!!!. but... there is one little problem... when I tap on my hippe guy to get food in a row I tap the animals but then I go to thing next to animal and does that then I have to do animals I didn't get to. and...yes there is more gameloft and readers. I never have enough stamina because I have a lot a lot of things. so it takes a lot of time and then I have to do it again cause they take like a minute then they are back.  so I always have to wait. so add more stamina and I think make it a lot more easy to touch stuff and break trees especially. trees
0439023521|4.0|In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called, \\"The Hunger Games,\\" a fight to the death on live TV. Wow, Katniss story is chilling, thrilling and makes your heart race. I was intrigued by teh premise but wanted to read teh book before seeing the movie. Well written.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Could not put it down, not huge fan of jumping back and forth in the timeline but didnt detract from the book. I could really relate to the characters and it really came face to face with tragedy and loss. I look forward to anything else this author releases.
0375869026|5.0|One of the best books I ever read.  Other reviewers have told you about the book.  I just want to tell you to read it! This is a book for all ages and reading levels and it will change you.  You will look at others differently and hopefully \\"choose to be kind.\\"  Read the book and you'll understand.

B00516ZWRE|5.0|\\"Call To Arms\\" continues this classic Brit. Metal band's (established in 1976)  string of brilliant later period records, which started in 1999 with \\"Metalhead\\", through \\"Killing Ground\\" (2001), \\"Lionheart\\" (2004), \\"The Inner Sanctum\\" (2007) & \\"Into The Labyrinth\\" (2009), after a bit, of a hit & miss (for me) period through the nineties, which of course, followed their classic period in the eighties, that put them on the map.<br />With exceptional production & not a bum track on it, \\"Call To Arms\\" starts off with a bang, ripping into Hammer of the Gods and does not let up, until the end of the orchestral version of \\"Call to Arms\\"- a nice addition. The songs are all top notch, with powerful vocals from Biff Byford, who is  not losing it, but getting better with age. Fantastic twin guitar attacks by Doug Scarratt & Paul Quinn and a super solid bottom end/rhythm section, courtesy of Nibbs Carter & Nigel Glockler (glad yer back). Saxon has never had a stronger lineup & thankfully this one, with the exception of drummers, has been the mainstay now for alot of years & hopefully for years to come. \\"Call To Arms\\" was my pick for metal/hard rock record of 2011 & alot of other metalheads I've run into, shared that sentiment. I particularly recommend picking up the deluxe version, which includes a second, 7 song Live CD- Live at Donington 1980, a Rocking look back at their early years.<br />Onward Saxon!!

My grandson (we started reading it when he was 2 1/2) picks this book to read first. In transporting the book it got wet and all the pages got stuck together, we were not happy. I found a copy of the book on Amazon and we are reading again. I also found out that this is a world famous book. It is a must for your reading list. Also, check out The Gruffalo DVD.

0143119680|5.0|I loved this book!!  From the minute I picked it up, I couldn't stop reading it!  And, I finished it last night, and have been thinking about it all day!!  The settings and characters are interesting and complex, every scene felt well thought out and integral.  Discovery of Witches is now one of my all time favorites, and I am looking forward to the release of the next book in the series!
0307956350|1.0|Though there was some hope when this book started out, hope that extended more than half way into the book, after that point it became clear that the author had lost his way.  In classic \\"I know my own book is ridiculous\\" writing fashion, the needed a chapter toward the end that explained everything.  Instead of it being an \\"aha\\" spy book moment, it became a \\"huh?\\" moment.  Very disappointing as this author does know how to write; he just doesn't know how to create a story.
0515142247|4.0|simple and sa·li·ent review.  just saying.<br /><br />the first book had a very self confident man who was always in control and it was from his perspective.  this book has a good story and was well written but the multiple POVs and the bit of a back slide on the character a bit but still a solid book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this set of games. My 4 yr old can play as well as my 12 yr old. My 2 yr old tries to play. I would recommend this game. I have it on my kindle fire and it hasn't given me any problems.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Having lived in the area where the movie was filmed, we have heard about this book for months and months.  I was anxious to get the books (I bought the trilogy on Amazon).  I read all three in a matter of days.  It was extremely well written and I could not wait to see what obstacles The Capital would put in their way next.  If you saw the movie first, it followed the story line but did not do the first book justice.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I started reading A Song of Ice and Fire books this summer and have just finished A Dance with Dragons.  First off, I can see why some fans were disappointed with ADWD.  GRRM seems to have slowed down the pace of the plot that he set with the first three books of this epic series.  The multitude of newly introduced characters seems the be the new cause of this.  But while it seems like most fans are annoyed by this, I on the other hand really love it.  GRRM wants to keep us guessing and the best way to do that is to tell several stories in one.  This book is not just about Tyrion, or Jon Snow, or Daenerys but instead of the diverse houses that make up Westeros and Valyria.  That's what I think makes this series so rich.  It is simply not good versus evil but instead it is of flawed characters with different outlooks on life in general.<br />ADWD continues the trend that GRRM has set in the first four books of unexpected plot twists and turns.  Twists and turns that make this series one of the most exhilarating reads I've ever had.  GRRM does not follow the generic model of good always defeating evil.  Sometimes the good guys die and if you've read all of these books you know what I'm talking about.  ADWD is the perfect setup book for what should be an exciting ending to a A Song of Ice and Fire with the final 2 books.  I can't wait!<br />So in conclusion I gave this book 4 stars because I thought it was still an exciting read.  No, it did not have as much exciting events happen like A Storm of Swords, but it still has its fair share.  If you are a fan of science fiction books in general, I would definitely read this series!
B0060Q962Q|3.0|It's like connect four, but on your phone / tablet. I wasn't too into the game, a little boring for my tastes. But it is a nice app. Everything seemed to work great on my Moto Atrix, and the design was nice. Just wasn't my type of game. Got it when it was the free app of the day

I'm not really big on this type of filming. i will admit one thing that, that could of and possibly happend and like it said nasa just wanted it all hush hush, but i really didn't see any real footage it was all acted and staged. they shouldn't anounce that  this was actual footage when it is only a publicity stunt.  i mean there was some actuall footage but they made it sound like the whole thing was real. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't
B004G25V9S|5.0|Needed to add another 5 star review.  Laughed that someone said Opeth was \\"power metal\\" which I guess is an opinion?  Been an Opeth fan since Morningrise and it's like having an extra family member; you are with them for life, they may to things you don't understand or don't appreciate, but you will never give up.  For me, this CD makes sense and actually picks up where Watershed left off, listening back to it shows that the prog-rock was trying to push through.  I would bet that the death metal growls are not gone forever, just taking a break.<br /><br />But if they ever try anything techno, then there'd be a problem.  Maybe?<br />Tweet @StrongPROGress

Using this adapter, I was able to attach my FW400 hub to the mini, and all my devices (which use the hub) just worked.  No problems.<br /><br />This $12 adapter was a lot less expensive than the alternative (a FW800 hub, three FW800 hard drive enclosures and a new webcam).  Worth every penny.
0439023521|2.0|Maybe it's Scholastic, maybe it's the (semi) inexperienced author, but Hunger Games is a horribly written story full of grammatical and spelling errors.  It goes against the grain of what some of the top selling authors (King, Card, Leonard) suggest on how to write a good, quality story.  Story-the story is wasted in the hands of a poor artist.  If you like 80+% narration, with little dialogue, little action, living in the head of this girl, with light description about important things (the setting, people, etc.), heavy description about meaningless items (what they had for dinner, for example), then THIS book is surely for you.  When a movie is better than the book it was based on, there's a problem.  Never in the history of man has that happened (I jest of course).  But it is the case with Hunger Games.<br /><br />Save your money and your time and re-read your favorite dystopian novel instead.  Suzanne Collins can only be credited with a pretty good story, a good idea, that generated a good movie (monetarily at least), but will not be credited as a good author.
1594203334|4.0|I'm only half way through the book, so I couldn't rightfully give it the full 5 stars, but I must say that so far I am absolutely smitten by the experiences that Pamela Druckerman writes about. I find myself nodding in agreement with much of what she has to say about her observations in French parenting and taking mental notes to add to my parenting style. Eye opening and comforting all at once. A must read for every mom-to-be.

B002NJWHHA|1.0|For a book with so much amazing imagery and such a well developed plot, the movie adaptation was honestly pathetic. Had I watched it without reading the book first, perhaps I could have enjoyed it as a mediocre adventure film. With the technology available today for special effects, so much could have been done better. And the alterations to the plot and characters were unnecessary and irritating. If you loved the book, do not waste your time or money on watching the movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this was a neat game lots of fun things to do never gets old keeps things new and with all the fifteenth game choices
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best book.  I bought it when I first got my kindle fire.  I read it quiet often. Thanks for making it available.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|when I downloaded this app for the first time I thought it was fun but when I played it. it wouldn't let me go back to my home screen and I had to shut my kindle down.do now download on kindle
0439023513|5.0|I wasn't aware that when my niece asked for this for Christmas, that it wasn't going to be released to the public until 12/23! Needless to say, I placed the order, and it came in a reasonable amount of time (I think for as popular as this book is). I was still glad I chose Amazon.com
B0055PGUYU|2.0|It seems that the author prioritized his best material for the intro and first chapter, and then the material stalls. The key examples used (NFL Coach Tony Dungy; Alcoholics Anonymous) appear to only weakly support his thesis. This seems more appropriate for a New Yorker article than a full book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game so far just passed level 3.  I am liking it......wish I could say more but that's all I got.&quot;
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game when there is nothing else to do. :)<br />great game for kids as well. levels are simple too.
0307352145|5.0|As an introvert who has always been regarded as not only quiet, but also timid and weak, this book is very refreshing. It puts into words what many introverts know intuitively; strength does not have to be loud, in your face, or aggressive. Strength and conviction can present themselves quietly without sacrificing effectiveness. Through impressive research, Ms. Cain clearly demonstrates the importance of both personality types and the value of introversion. I only wish that I could have read this book when I was younger so that I would have been more confident and accepting of my own nature. After reading it now, I do feel that I can better articulate the importance of my role in society and take pride in the contributions that introverts have made throughout history.<br /><br />Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher which has in no way influenced my review. Thank you.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A great read! Great recommendation for mature Jr. High and older. My daughter, my mother & I all read the book & can't wait for the chance to see the movie together.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Boy oh boy...What a good book. I was very impressed with the book and now even more then before I want to see the movie. It wasn't hard at all to fall in love with these characters. Spark's makes it so easy to feel everything his characters are feeling. And man did I dislike Clayton. He was absolutely horrid and even at the end I still had zero respect for him.<br />Like all of Spark's books you come to expect something awful and sad to happen near the end, so I was begging and pleading that Logan made it out alive. I won't give anything away, but the ending was a bit of a surprise in many ways.<br />I think Logan's character may be one of my faves I have read. He was so perfect and genuine. Even when he was holding back his true reason for showing up I still loved him.<br />I love the photograph, that it was so lucky for him and in the end it was lucky for someone else too. I think his whole journey was for more reasons then you even know while reading, but I love how the book wrapped everything up and made it almost magical.<br />I think this is a book that anyone who enjoys a good romance and heartfelt story would enjoy. I couldn't put it down.<br />I guess the only gripe I did have was the actions of Clayton at the end. It was a little odd, but that didn't take away from anything. I found it hard to really understand Clayton's issues because he sort of went back and forth. He said one thing and did another kind of. But mostly I felt he was a bad guy.<br /><br />Lastly, it was a great read. It had all the qualities I want in a book and I might have to say it is possibly a new fave. It was perfect and beautiful.<br /><br />Loved the book!
B0079TQHDO|4.0|I had been waiting eagerly for the second instalment of \\"The Clifton Chronicles\\" and was not disappointed. Could not put it down...kept reading till couldn't stay awake any longer and finished it the next morning. Archer certainly knows how to hook his readers. Maybe a bit predictable, but still worth the read.
0618680004|5.0|Very informative book! Professor Dawkins views are very similar to mine though he is much much smarter than I am. I recommend this book to everyone
B003R50FRI|5.0|This is an amazing book! Supposedly a novel, the author's true life experiences seem be interwoven in the story.It surprises, amazes, informs, horrifies and humbles the reader. There are many life lessons to be found in Shantaram.<br />Highly recommended.
B006X8GFBQ|5.0|This is an amazing story. Through Alastair Reynolds Sci Fi has evolved to a new level. I think he is the new Azimov.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I was going to give this a 4 star rating until I listened to the commentary/musical. This was a very entertaining movie, even though I thought the ending was weak. But, the musical commentary was fabulous. OMG, I don't think I have ever been so entertained. Who ever thought that a commentary would be as, or even more entertaining than the show. Trust me, if you like music, laughter and just being entertained, buy this. Who cares about the plot. Excellent!!
088708155X|1.0|Buyers, beware of the dimensions.  This book is tiny.  It is hardcover, but at a TINY 5\\"x4\\" you cannot read this book to a whole classroom.  Very disappointed when I received it to find out it was not full size.  I love the story, though.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The author was obviously trying to write a book about what war can do to people and how terrible the consequences are; however, in focusing solely on that goal she completely forgot about the characters that her readers had grown to love over the previous two books. It basically felt like the author sacrificed the actual characterization of the main characters (how they acted and felt in the prior two books) in order to better drive home the impact of the war, like she'd built up these characters for people just so that when she used their names in a scene the reader would be more impacted.<br /><br />All this accomplishes is making the book feel unsatisfying. Everything that happens after Suzanne Collins is done examining the effects of war seems rushed and poorly thought out. It's like she wrote the book up to a point and submitted it, only to have the publisher tell her that she needed to wrap the story up. Collins did but you can tell she didn't really care, she cared about the war but not the characters. While the first two books were good I have to say that this book has dragged an otherwise outstanding trilogy to mediocre.
B002EWD08Q|3.0|This is entrancing, stoner rock - an album that is greater than the sum of its parts. The bass and drum rhythms are haunting from start to finish, and the melodies draw the listener in. However - and I cannot say whether this is a compliment or a criticism - I'm not sure whether to think of this as the third Arctic Monkeys album, or the latest Queens of the Stone Age. It seems that Josh Homme took the Arctic Monkeys into the studio and recorded a Desert Sessions - stoner melodies, thumping drums, sexual references in the lyrics. In seeking a new direction, the Arctic Monkeys really only hit the nail on the head with their excellent fourth album, Suck It and See. Here, they're a bit too imitative to be innovative. Nevertheless, originality issues aside, Humbug is quite good, and worth buying. Stand-outs are \\"My Propeller,\\" \\"Crying Lightning,\\" and \\"Potion Approaching.\\"
B003L16FAE|4.0|Ordered this edition of Predator on Blu Ray from Amazon which was delivered quickly and in excellent condition.  This is the first review I will have ever written that begins with the extras.  My lord, there sure are a great deal of them and they are all really some of the best you can find.  Not just previews for other films, tho that is there as well, but deleted scenes, a wonderful memorial to the actor who played the Predator that wasn't watching the clock, a super \\"Making of' that far surpasses those type of shorts found on other DVDs, great and interesting interviews with all the major actors after 15 years had passed. Oddly, Arnold didn't interview but is seen in several of the other extras, short takes with the writers and directors that actually were interesting and gave you real insight into the production.  All of it was very pertinent and valuable.  I guess the only poor extra was a preview into the remake with the horribly miscast Adrian Brody.<br /><br />This film has legs, there is no question about that. The reason is because this was a Sci Fi film not about the special effects but about the characters themselves.  The special effects simply enhanced the story.  It had you involved with each character, including the predator, on a basic and emotional level.  You cared about them.  Personally, I think Sonny stole the show with his mystical Indian awareness that they were all going to die.  It really was an ensemble movie and not just about Arnold and that made a big difference.<br /><br />Of course, there were plenty of special effects and the lossless DTSHD audio was a big contributor in creating the claustrophobia of the jungle atmosphere.  There was considerable use of the front left and right channels as, of course, the center channel.  I was a bit surprised that the rear surrounds were not used more than they were.  There were several spots where they came into play but I felt that, especially in the jungle scenes, there could have been more ambient FXs coming through them.  The helicopters certainly made use of the entire 5.1 system and the sub got a good workout with the many explosions throughout.  Honestly, I think the audio mix could have been better and made use of discreet channeling more than it did rather than simply have the same audio from both left and right surrounds.  I own a fairly high end system, Aerial Acoustics all around with two Aragon Amplifiers and a Rotel Processor which recently replaced my old Lexicon processor so discreet use of audio channels is as important to me as a good video transfer.<br /><br />On the video side....we have a problem NASA.  The transfer really was inconsistent.  There is one scene very early on where Carl Weathers face looks as if it were smoothed over by photoshop pro and then in the next scene, just a few seconds later, his face shows the detail that was missing in the earlier shot. Glad it wasn't an important scene and it was a short shot but, I have never seen such a poor image on a DVD that was in that one shot.  Most of the rest of the video transfer was fairly decent.  Nothing great but not as distracting to me as that one shot was.<br /><br />Is the DVD on Blu Ray worth having?  While not the best video transfer, it is still a great movie and the extras were all outstanding.  Guess my answer is Yes.  The price is right, and while not perfect, worth having in your blu ray library.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksent FXs coming through them.

0545265355|5.0|These books live up to all the hype! Makes anyone a fan! A great time that makes you wish the series was 20 books long!!
B007BLEKPM|5.0|This was Very interesting and entertaining! We really enjoyed this movie. I would watch it again one day. Very good movie.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I have two of these cases, purchased them along with two Kindle Fires back in the fall, one for myself and one for an employee to use, so I've been using them for about five months now. Two months ago I would have given these devices four stars out of five, my only complaints being that the \\"stand\\" doesn't always hold up well, and I worried that the strap would wear out. Other than that, I was very satisfied with the devices, and they DO do a good job of protecting my Fire. I've dropped it about five times since I purchased it, and a couple of times I dropped it HARD on a hard surface, and this cover has done an excellent job of protecting it. And my fears about the strap were unfounded--yes, it's a little stretched out now compared to when I first got it, but five months later it's still holding up fine.<br /><br />So what's the problem, then? The rubber coating on the case. As far as I can tell, the case itself is made of a hard plastic, and the cover flap is cardboard, and both appear to be coated with a rubberized coating. The problem is that the rubberized coating--on both cases--has begun to peel off. I first noticed it on the Kindle Fire that my employee had. Almost the entire back of the case had lost its rubber coating. I asked him what he'd done to his Fire, and he said nothing. I hardly believed him until a couple of weeks ago. I took my Kindle Fire out into the sun to read (Contrary to online reviews, you CAN read the Fire in even bright sunlight if the screen brightness is turned up all the way). When I came back into the hotel room I felt a strange roughness to the Marware case. I looked down and the rubber on both edges of the case had begun to crack, just as it had on the other case. Yes, I'd been out in the sun, but it hadn't been THAT hot outside (high 70's), and I'd actually been in the shade for most of the time.<br /><br />I want to be clear that I don't think the cracking of the rubber coating is affecting the protection the case provides, which is the main reason that I purchased it. But it LOOKS terrible, which is why I've given it such a low rating.<br /><br />I'll be purchasing a new case for my Fire soon. You can bet that I won't be buying THIS case.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|it pretty kool its alot like mario brothers its  easy to play the acorns are a good idea im glad i downloaded it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Lep's World is sooooo much FUN!!!!!!! I've been waiting for it to come out so I could get it on my kindle fire. It is the BEST game EVER!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is ok it kinds get boring really quick so who knows its just my opinion so you may actually like it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very awesome app fun to play has lots of games varrying certain difficulties all depending what mood your in. also very very addicting be warned.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|I bought this when it was a \\"deal of the day.\\" I've owned cheap multi-tools in the past that rust and I throw them out but this one by far is the most well built. I like that the tool can lock; however I sometimes find it hard to unlock when my fingers are wet or sore because the unlock mechanism is so small. Some of the tools seem redundant but it's nice to have the assortment.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|It is a great game! The added physics of the gravity adds an all new depth to the gameplay. Overall very fun game. Can not wait for the update with new levels!
B006YXTRHY|2.0|The others were so good but this movie was quite disappointing.  It seemed to draw out with no real purpose other than the wedding.  Certain aspects of the movie seemed cheesy like the wolves talking.  In my oppinion it just didn't seem well done.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|it is fun for a puzzel game. it makes you think a little bit. some physics are envoled here.  the praise when you finish a level is nice.
B004FJJGBG|4.0|The movie was great. Wonderful effects and a very enveloping movie watching experience...\\"In the movie theater that is\\"!!!! I have not been able to see this on DVD due to the ridiculously high prices that vendors are charging for this. This is simply another version of \\"scalping\\" and the producers of this film seem to not care one way or the other. I can't afford to pay $100 plus for a video that should be priced at 25% of that figure. Now I see that the 3D version of Titanic which has just been released in theaters is already scheduled for release on video this coming Sept. So the question begs to be answered. Why hasn't Avatar, a nearly 2 year old movie, been released for general purchase in 3D? Do any of you astute movie experts out there have a clue? If so please fill me in on what  am not understanding here. Maybe they are going to re-release the movie in theaters again and milk it for all it's worth before it get's an official DVD launch. How frustrating!!!!!<br /><br />Forgive me if this isn't the proper place to vent my frustration. But I did after all give the movie itself an enthusiastic thumbs up.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|This Cd is the bomb! Great music, great songs, great sound just a great cd all around-buy it!You won't go wrong!
B0076NAWWA|4.0|Do not overanalize it...it is pure power pop magic...try to enyoy life a little bit!!!<br />Buy it, play it, like it, smile....it is not that complicated.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was a great read, very hard to put down.  It is written so well, you'll want to keep going through the whole trilogy at one sitting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book is a good read...easy to pick up and read a few chapters on the Galaxy S2 Kindle app in quiet moments of the day.  All 3 books are good but this one is the best

B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a cool app it is funny fun fun. This is cool because it tells you how to win
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game rocks. But everyone is right. It does take a little long to get Energy.  Better than most games on here. But hey,  its free.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game we love it . my little one loves to go to the movie part. better then we thought.
0007119550|4.0|The book was delivered promptly and in great condition (as specified). This is an excellent series and with them not having split this book up here in the United States, and yet I purchased the first half of it in England, it was excellent to be able to get the book quickly and cheaply from here within the United States.
B002RKRSV0|1.0|My review is only for this free Kindle version. There are many little errors and I do not recommend downloading it. There are missing words, misspelled words, missing sentences, wrong words, etc. A couple of examples: \\"Aunt Juicy\\" instead of Aunt Juley, the bit of song that Jacky says when the character is introduced is missing, \\"her began to mingle with his retreating thunder\\" instead of \\"her chirrupings began to mingle.\\" There's really no excuse for this and I'm tired of checking it against google books when I think something sounds weird.
0307956350|5.0|After reading all three Hunger Games and all three Girl with The Dragon Tattoo books, this was a great book to read.  I loved the way Chris pavone keeps junpimg from one thread to the other.  I wasn't able to figure out the story or the ending until I read it.  Great job for Chris Pavone.  I can't wait to read his next book.
B007BDK3SS|3.0|Good game. the things that could be improve are no additional charater or bike to choose and the graphic could be better.
0140544518|5.0|I remember this book when I was young and now I read it to my kids.  They love it and always try to get me to read it again and again.  It is the story of the three little pigs from the innocent wolf's perspective.  We follow him through the book as he tries to ask a cup of sugar from three rude pigs with disastrous results.  I would recommend this book for any child.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Connelly has written another good read.  Fast paced and filled with lots of suspense this is one of his better books.  If you like Connelly you will love this one
B00127RAJY|5.0|No one will ever read this, I just wanted to put my star in. This is the video that started my love for workout videos!
B0061S0A64|5.0|This app is incredible. you don't understand how this music cools me down. it makes me feel chill. its an amazing app.
B007IYWY3C|3.0|If I could give this 3.5 stars I definately would. Florence Welch sings beautifully but I find the set a little boring. Honestly, do we need another remake of Try a Little Tenderness. Otis Redding did such an amazing job singing it that it has been difficult for others to make it fresh. Florence + the Machine fail to do so here. I do like her cover of Jackson but she doesn't add anything new to it. I don't regret purchasing this by any means, and again it is beautifully done, especially for a live album, but it lacks the energy that is on their studio albums.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|its a brain game you have to be on your game to play. it keeps you on your toes.  I love the game iit will play tricks on your mind
0439023521|5.0|This book was intriguing, captivating and made me want to not only read it on my travels to and from work but when I got home, so in essence I was done with the book in 4 days and onto Catching Fire which took me 4 days to read as well.  Now I'm reading Mockingjay.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|controls are very simple game itself is alot of fun.  entertaining  game to play and  pass some time. would highly recommend
B0001LJCPC|3.0|I found this CD to be OK, but not really impressed with it after I got it.  I would not recommend this CD.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read a number of reviews that panned this second book as slow, criticized the ambivalence Katniss feels regarding Peeta vs Gale, etc and I almost didn't read it because of them. Well, this is a more complex story, much darker, and I thought more compelling in its own way. I would have liked to have seen the journey to all 12 regions at the beginning of the book fleshed out a bit and the generous actions taken by Peeta and Katniss which especially provoked the capitol further held until a bit later in the trip, but given the length of the book and the audience, I understand the choice the author made.<br /><br />We are truly introduced to more characters in this book, personalities are developed a bit more, a sense of the regions and what is going on in them is clearer, hidden strengths are brought to the fore. Katniss' love for both Gale and Peeta is clarified and develops --- as it should in a 15-16 year old girl!  I had compassion for all three in this triangle and enjoyed that the author did not simply truncate the struggle to discern the kinds of love involved (friendship? parental replacement? love worthy of marriage?) and to honor those well --- as well, that is, as the situation allowed. This was a healthy piece of life in a terribly dysfunctional society and situation and it is good to have this in books geared to young adults. So was the strong element of sacrifice and the sense that sometimes competing values make any choice difficult and less than ideal.<br /><br />I want no spoilers in this review so let me say it is a more compelling read than the first book and I am looking forward to reading the third book in the trilogy. I suspect the author was caught between the choice to write something longer with even more character development and complexity, or something shorter for a different audience. I think she does a good job given the choice she made.
1416972250|5.0|Loved it, I was engrossed until the end.  I almost didn't read it as I was too disappointed in the way way the 2nd book ended.  Read it you will be glad you did if you loved the first 2 books in the series  - it brings everthing together.
B005SAP45I|2.0|720P download speed..... Really.<br /><br />Here is the problem.. I spent the big bucks on the big screen... dvr's, Blu-ray (ya, I know bad call on blu-ray.. but who knew?) and what do I get..... 720P.<br /> I spent the bucks on Internet,also... 20meg download speed...<br /><br />still 720P..<br /><br />Amazon, I really want more from you. cut loose some of your $$$$ and install some fast internet lines with Big pipes (think mircosoft) and redeem yourself.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is a build a village type game.  like smurf village or cityville.  The graphics are optimized for the kindle fire and looks awesome. There are quests to complete and plenty to do to keep you coming back for more.  I was really impressed with the quality of the game especially because its free.  One of the best village building games ive played.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Its a fun-fun-fun game and the challenge of dealing with gravity, and the lack of gravity is a nice twist to a very popular game. Unfortunately there do not seem to be enough levels or challenges. Hopefully more content will come soon and without added cost. I was not fast to get on the angry-bird band waggon, and still have not played the original non-space version of the game, but this one is very fun albeit limited in scope. For the price is was fun, but more content would have made the purchase better! 4 stars for game play and overall fun. 1 more star could be earned for more content.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is one of the best games out there I can't stop playing it I'm totally hooked on it..I love it!!!
B0061S0A64|3.0|this app looks like a copy of Reactable. which is not on the amazon app store. if you do not know what i am talking about . youtube &quot;reactable&quot;. anyhow nice try ill play with it . i already own reactable but a downgrade one should be okay also.
0783229364|3.0|Last night's bargain-rack DVD movie was \\"The Secret of My Success\\" starring Michael J. Fox. In the movie, Fox traveled from Kansas to New York City to make his success and fortune. He stumbled along the way and ended up with a mailroom job (thanks to his long-lost Uncle and CEO) at a major corporation. I can relate to that as I used to have a mailroom job, but I didn't have such an uncle. In any case, it soon got somewhat more hard to believe in that he became a self-motivated corporate freelancer and set up his domain in a vacant office and managed to procure loads of supplies and his own secretary. He also met Helen Slater, a lower-level corporate executive and Harvard graduate,  and was smitten. That's understandable, the smitten part. Then things started to get wild. Too wild, really. The early part of the movie introduced the characters and it was rather interesting. I was looking forward to settling in to a good comedy. The latter part of the movie decayed into a farce.<br /><br />Fox got seduced by the bosses wife (remember, the boss was his uncle) and his boss seduced his new-found and potential girlfriend (Slater), an employee. Things started to get complicated. Real complicated. Eventually, everyone attended  a large company gathering. Seducers and seducees are totally intermingled. Oh, I forgot. The boss thought  his nephew was a mail-room employee, as he was hired, and had no idea that he was a self-appointed corporate executive going under a different name and had somehow risen into the upper corporate ranks. The whole thing was a total fiasco and probably most people would find it to be hilariously funny. I didn't. The more complex it became, the more tedious it became. Toward the end, I just wanted to turn the whole farce off.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Only reason im rating this a 1 is because i cant get it for free on my kindle fire  needs to be free i am so addicted to thd angry bird series i would love to be able to play
B003YUU62U|4.0|Let me start by saying that I have never found a shoe/sandal/sneaker that I was happy with right out the box...not the kind of gal that prances out of the store in rapture. These are the exception!!! Slipped on like a dream. No rubbing,no blisters,nice and comfy. I have wide feet and with all shoes this is a concern, these are fabu! Forget about converse which are like torture (too narrow and no support)these are the best!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game to get your brain working! It's hard to put down once you start! Highly recommended for any one and everyone!
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews. This is a product that is pretty simple to set up. I mainly play Call of Duty with it, but I also watch Netflix with this on sometimes. It really enhances the sound to a point which televisions are not capable. I'm not a big headset guy and i'm sure this isn't the best, but for the price, it is definitely worth it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love these books and have already read them about 3 times a piece! I bought these via kindle wifii and it is great
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good and a great \\"cliff hanger\\" at the end.  Couldn't wait to start Book Two!  Book Two is proving to be as just as good as Book One ... hate putting it down!!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I've been playing this game on my kindle fire and have been experiencing terrible repear glitches with the count downs to reproduction of food or money.. and the energy regeneration is horrible also. If these two problems were fixed this would be a fun game but the glitches make it unbearable
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this game has soo much missons i am having a blast killing people. having new missons is so fun because you dont know who u are going to kill<br /> PEACE
1451683405|1.0|Foolish me. When I saw that this new book on Free Will was only $9.99 I had no choice but to buy it. I was assuming that the author would use some of the knowledge from his PhD in Neuroscience to present some new information and walk me through some of the nuances of free will.<br /><br />However, when the book arrived with 66 pages of text, I was a little surprised. When the first 5 pages went through the grisly details of a Connecticut home invasion to introduce the concept of free will I was disturbed. But, it was what I brought to read on the train and I was stirred up about the notion that we might not really have Free Will by Christof Koch in an article in Scientific American Mind. So, I willed myself to read on.  Sam Harris spends another WHOLE PAGE on the Libet experiment showing our premotor cortex lights up before we are conscious of our decision to move our hand. A little more on this key building block would be good. He does discuss determinism and compatibilism. The latter belief is that free will is compatible with the determinism of the physical world. He spends many pages paraphrasing Daniel Dennett and then showing the fallacy of what he has paraphrased.<br /><br />The book does make clear that indeterminism, quantum or chaos does not give us back free will. However, there are too many fluffy thought experiments and expositions that seem to amount to \\"I told you so\\". The implications for responsibility and morality are short and thin. The author ends with a discussion about how he needs to go make a sandwich. In the end I was glad it was short.<br /><br />The issue is fascinating, but, this book is totally disappointing. The feeling I am left with is that Sam Harris whipped this out to cash in on a meme that is rising fast. While I do not want to wish the author ill will, he has tread upon my good will. But, I supposed he could not help himself.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I don't like how you have to buy all the games. you can only get about 9000 on one game and u need 90000to buy one. overall it is a good game .
B004YF6MHW|1.0|THIS IS A SCAM! IT WOULD NOT LET ME INSTALL AND SAID I HAD NOT PURCHASED IT BUT NOW THERE IS A CHARGE ON MY CARD THAT SHOWED UP AFTER THE REFUND PERIOD!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very good.  Modern version of 1984. It is full of suspense.  The emotional bond you make with the characters keeps you reading.  Hard to put down.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|It could use a few improvements, including a wider colour range. For me the biggest downfall is the inability to erase instead of undoing. Sometimes I wish to erase something without undoing everything else.<br />Apart from that it's great for a free app and useful in class for editing a snapshot of notes on the board. :)
0743486285|5.0|A well put togehter book of a person who was falling apart but part of the one of the biggest rock bands in history. This timeline was one of the most interesting accounts of Nikki Sixx and the band Motley Crue that I have read. This is a roller coaster ride from begining to the end, there are not stops on this ride and please keep your hands and feet inside the car. I kept reading and looked forward to reading this book just to see what happened next. Also, I had attended some of the show dates that were mentioned in the book so I had a personal connection to some of the diary entries. It was very interesting reading those diary entries in particular. This book leaves you to wonder what else is in those diary enteries or what other diaries are still out there. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of any music artist. This book with suck you in, pull you thru the depths of Nikki's hell and back again. You will have a different perspective of Nikki Sixx after reading this book. This is the true life of sex, drugs and rock and roll, along with all the drama that comes along with it. From the ex-wives, family, record execs and fans. Nikki, thank you for sharing, I have a whole new respect for you and your music.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote is a very handy app to have. I use it in so many different areas of my life: Recording homework assignments; taking snapshots on the board with my phone to review and make notes on the Kindle Fire later (using Skitch) and exercise routines so I can quickly glance at them in the gym.<br />The mobile UI is fine, though I wouldn't object to an upgrade to make it easier to use.<br />It's never let me down in terms of functuality, and I would definitely recommend it.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|Having played trial xtreme 1 already , i found version 2 pretty interesting. personally its a pretty tough to complete levels in one shot.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I´m delighted with the presentation!! The pics are lovely...The bonus dvd´s are great..I´m enjoying it  all the way!! I recommend it to all Smallville fans!!=))
B0052GACNM|5.0|I thought Tony Bennett couldn't out-do his first Duets CD, but this one beat all of my expectations.  Plus you get an unheard of SEVENTEEN songs on the CD....GREAT!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|it's. very fun at first. bust after while things glitch and the whole game messes up and any money u invest in it gets erased. be careful when spending money.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|This book was slow to get started but once it did I couldn't put it down. You have to pay attention because it jumps around and if you are not careful the characters get jumbled. But a very good book that just keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end. I have read the whole series and all we excellence.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is better than the one from my younger days. Download this app if you loved the original Oregon trail.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is great! deffinately recommend it! it is a must have. helps the time pass great! download today or your missing out!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I bought this because my Pioneer nav unit charge cable didn't fit anymore when I got a new iSkin case for my iPhone4. The charge port opening on the iSkin case was just a hair too small, and the cable's connector was a bit too thick to stay connected. This adapter worked perfectly. It is the same thickness as a standard Apple charge connector, and fits really securely to both the nav unit cable and the phone. I leave it connected to the nav unit cable, and just connect my phone when I need to charge it.<br /><br />I did not have any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers of the fit on the phone end being too tight - it is just right. I do not have any problems with nav unit controls - everything worked exactly as it does without the extender. Great find--thanks, CableJive!
1609611543|4.0|I started this diet two weeks ago and have already lost 6 lbs!  In addition, I know people who have had success with it.  That said the book could have been a little more useful in addressing consumption of high glucemic indexed (GI)gluten free (GF) carbs.  No mention is made of (1) the ability of eating a moderate or high (GI) food item along with a zero or low GI food item to blunt the insulin spike effect of the high GI item; (2) no mention that gluten free all-purpose flour, which is supposedly moderately high GI, can be modified by adding psyllium husks, buckwheat kernels and other low GI grains to lower the overall GI of the flour; and (3) eating high GI foods in moderation to lower the overall glycemic load (affect) on blood sugar.  I was somewhat interested in the menus until I got to the pizza.  WOW! A crust made of mashed up cauliflower!  Come on, pizza with a normal crust is a low GI food.  The book, \\"The NEW Glucose Revolution\\" rates a slice of Pizza Hut deep dish pizza a 45 GI rating with a glycemic load of only 9.  Overall, the author's message is good.  However, I recommend readers supplement this book with one I found to give more practical advice on controlling the insulin response to foods.  I recommend you check out \\"The NEW Glucose Revolution, Low GI Gluten Free Eating Made Easy\\".
B0061S0A64|5.0|This app is great.  Even with minimal music skills you will feel like your own personal DJ.  I downloaded it as a free app of the day but would have paid for it.
B0058QSSD2|5.0|Love the movie.<br /><br />Great case and great extra's about the movie...  Great buy. ..... Jus need to get a surround sound to really enjoy the rush.
0345803485|1.0|Let's see, I've read this somewhere before.  Yes, in the Penthouse or Hustler magazines male roommates left on the coffee table in college--only SM was far too kinky for those magazines back then.<br /><br />If you are interested in poorly written smut, then this is for you.  Repetitive language, bad use of the first person POV, an unreliable narrator--it's all there.<br /><br />I wondered just what the \\"fifty\\" shades were, but the author seems content to repeat \\"scorching grey,\\" and \\"smoldering grey' over and over.  That, along with a slutty \\"inner goddess,\\" gave my inner prude a smoldering migraine, and I gave up halfway through. I really couldn't read another paragraph about the protagonist's sore vagina.<br /><br />It says a lot about how low American culture has gotten when something like this tops the bestseller lists.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Thanks for a great copy of this movie.  Had a VHS copy years ago, lost it.  Happy<br />to have it again.
B004TF3HZ2|5.0|Once again Steve Hackett does not disappoint.  He truly appreciates his fans which motivates him to really do his best when playing and recording.  Steve is a true musician and composer and his live shows are full of energy and they sound great.  Live Rails is full of fresh energy.  I really enjoy it.  Thanks Steve Hackett
0446618322|5.0|Everyone should read The Lucky One!  A true feel-good book - you can't put it down!  Thank you for sending it so promptly!  I look forward to reading more Nicholas Sparks books as it is the perfect way to end the day!
B005H1SDQU|5.0|Steve Hackett has never really been promoted in America like he should be.  Thank Goddess that \\"Prog\\" music is alive and well as of late in many parts of the globe.  He has received fantastic accolades from the \\"Prog\\" community and the American R & R Hall Of Fame induction is certainly deserving.  With that said, I will never tire of Steve's music because he never compromises.  Steve always records music the way he hears it in his head....the way all real artists record.  And I know personally he greatly appreciates his audience.  If you get the chance to attend a live performance by Steve and his band you will know what I mean.  I saw a PBS doc recently where they put head phones on an old Black Man in a nursing home and played the music he so loved in his youth.  This senile old man perked up immediately and could articulate the songs....eyes beaming with a smile on his face that he probably hadn't had in many years.  I will tell you that when those days come for me you had better play Steve Hackett.....better yet....I think I will always play his music, everyday,  because the sunset soundscapes and the panoramic views he paints are second to none. You can't go wrong with anything Steve has recorded.  This album is one of his finest.  As is the one just before this called Out Of The Tunnels Mouth.  I can't say enough about them.  Bravo Steve Hackett.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I appreciate the versatility of reading different translations. We should read the King James as much as possible but when the language  is sometimes hard to understand you can choose  another translation for clarity.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best thing that eba happened ta meh this game is very awesome and plus i llay it everyday soo uea its cool
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a very fun and addictive game. been playing for hours. we love scratch in our house. and Sid too
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best show that I have ever watched.  I can't wait until Season 3.  I am very involved with everyone's life.  Did Mr. Briggs do it or not???
0307341577|5.0|I loved this book, it was soooo clever and well written but keeps you guessing to the end. I would recommend this highly right up there with Coben, Connely, Crais, and the big ones. A must read!!
B005460302|4.0|i dont understand why the reviews for this blu ray are so low i thought the movie looked great and i have other blu rays that look worse than this. It is definataly not bottom of the barrel as far as im concered and a great blu ray pick up for anyone looking to build some vampire type movies on the ray.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|The app is awesome for people that forget this or that bill or miscellaneous payment that needs to do. You can even input your paycheck amount or any money you will receive to keep track if your are going to be over. You can set it up for the recurring bills to reappear, you just to adjust the amounts if needed. :D
B005NKGEP2|3.0|I will never buy a book based on the publisher's 2 page ad in NY TIMES Book Review.<br />The characters were flat and interchangeable, as were the exotic settings.<br />Luxembourg, Paris, Amsterdam might as well have been Atlanta, Charlotte, or<br />Richmond. The CIA/FBI plot was unbelievable. (I hate the way CIA characters in fiction are allowed to roam around, killing people and getting away with it.) The reason I gave it 3 stars is that I liked the way the author moved around in time, cutting from one event to another, but I thought the last scene in the cafe would never end as each character told or didn't tell how they had been lying to each other the whole time. Ho-hum.<br /><br />I thought this was a mystery or a thriller; it is neither, so my bad for not checking it out more closely before I hit buy.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I love this app its great. if ur using ur kindle fire and want to use a photo from the gallery u hit the card on the bottom not gallery then once u have hit the card hit download and u pick a photo,  anyway this is a great app I do reccomend it for editing photos or just wanting to play with photos :)
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|Im very disappointed we sit down to watch the movie and right in the middle of it it stops and that was it . Never had anything like this happen. Hope I can get my money back.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are not bad. could. use more action games and racing and less puzzles.  but all together it keeps my kids happy and entertained
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|at first I thought this was going to be the Oregon trail game we used to play in elementary. school but it definitely isn't. however it is fun to play and it reminds me a lot of frontierville on fb.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|What's not to like? Great graphics. Easy for kids. Great gameplay. Sure it's derivative but that's what makes it great.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a very cute game and an awesome time killer. I love the movies and the game is an extra added bonus.
B000FBHC7S|5.0|Great Album, DOOOMMMM!!!!!! I feared for my soul after this listening, MUHAhahahahahahaha  I think my so8ul is forever compromised, the infection has begun......
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I bought Kisses on the Bottom the day it came out and I listened to it in the car a loved it. My favorite tracks are \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter\\",\\"It's Only A Paper Moon\\",\\"Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive\\", and of course \\"My Valentine\\".
B007H51DQG|5.0|The episode was easy to view on our laptop. Renting the show was simple as well. Amazon had the best price. We will certainly order from the website in the future.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It is just like Super Mario Bros... If you have a Kindle Fire, like me, you know that you can't download Mario, so this is the next best thing. AND it was FREE!!
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Clint Eastwood has done some of his best work over the last twenty years. I just seen this film for a second time and was moved again by its depth of insight, profound character development, along with Clint's profound interpretation of the character of Walt. This performance was an Oscar caliber rendition in my view.<br /><br />Eastwood's Directing also brings sensitivity to the characters and the issues they face in a social context of gang violence in the hood.<br /><br />This film is a humanistic tour de force and only enhances the gruff character portrayal Eastwood delivers as protagonist.<br /><br />The relationship between Eastwood and Tau is the major theme of the film and it tells a contemporary  story of the mentorship of a wise (if overly gruff) man who leads a young man in to the ways of the world, but additionally, tells us that care and concern for marginalized populations is an act of great courage.<br /><br />In my opinion, Eastwood is a Master Filmmaker of the highest caliber.
0307454568|4.0|Ordinary person would be incompetent with the reckless enforcers. The counterattack to the authorities by the protectors of Lisbeth made us feel as if a burden had been lifted off our mind. The court scene by Annika Giannini is the highlight of this book. The spiritless lawyer with frustration till then took a new turn in full throttle. The section was cornered to crash. This is the very example of disintegration of the organization by protecting the rotten apple within. Blomkvist didn't seem to settle in with Monica. How did Stieg Larson imagine Blomkvist's domestic life, and his relation with Lisbeth, Monica and Erika in future stories?
B0055SWM08|5.0|really fun, this gets the creative juices pumping, in may ways like portal... i'm addint this part caus it requires a 20 wprd minimum review, and this is a nice loophole in that
B003Z0D4SM|4.0|Lastly I read this book. I saw the Daniel Craig's movie first, then read \\"played with fire\\" and \\"the hornet's nest\\" after the movie. Even after the powerful blow of the picture, I could fully enjoy the contents. It is most thrilling part where Blomkvist's persistent inquiry for old pictures was finally paid off and opened the door to the weathered labyrinth. Stieg Larson generously weaved several attractive stories into a dramatic one. I wouldn't be the only person who fell victim to the outrageous personality of Lisbeth Salander. It's very sad Larsson died too young soon after this trilogy. Blomkvist seemed to get a inkling of Salander's crime of stealing Wennerstorm's money, which the movie didn't describe on. How did Larson plan to settle this matter between Blomkvist and Salander in the future story. Other than this the book contains so many seeds the author could grow. I wish I could enjoy another adventure with the hacker republic, a different story of Lisbeth's twin sister Camilla's life, etc.
B0061S0A64|3.0|I love these kind of apps where there is so many creative things you can do but this one app is not the best. I think first off it is a little to hard to get used to. I didn't know how to use it! Whenever I start to have fun it foreclosed. I wouldn't spend my money on this app but it is ok.
0307949508|5.0|I was enthralled by this cat and mouse hunting story in every sense of the word. Millennium's next feature of sex trafficking triggered the chase. Lisbeth's past and Erika Berger's career move coloured the classical chasing story profoundly. All episodes converged onto one person. How dramatic past Lisbeth lived. What a disgusting villain her father was. The story develops as if it denies the existence of social justice. Mikael's devotion, unexpected onstage of boxer Paolo Roberto and non biased investigation by Bublansky and Modig give us a ray of hope to this world. Stieg Larsson inserted related trivia between every part of the trilogy, \\"DV\\" in \\"Dragon Tattoo,\\" \\"Amazon\\" in \\"the Hornet Nest\\" and \\"equation\\" in this book. Did he try to imply something like retribution by writing about equation?
B00785P2QC|3.0|The concept of the game is great like all other games based on having a virtual city. The problem. that I have is the same as other takers. You can't achieve some of the goals the developers have set without using actual money. While this disclosure is made in the game description,  it doesn't disclose just how restrictive it is. Achieving the basic goals are nearly impossible without spending cash to meet the requirements of the goal. Should be improved but game is ok.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|I'm not usually big on survival movies, but am on Liam Neeson movies. To this against all odds suspense survival movie, Liam Neeson adds his usual emotional flair simply in the tone of his voice and the mere energy he adds to any movie. The Grey will keep you guessing as to what and who will happen next right up to the last minute where you will on the edge of your seat holding your breath (I know I was)! Great movie, well worth getting.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This is a great app. It is really fun to make some little beats here and there. I'm still exploring, but I haven't found a way to close the app
B005LAIGW8|3.0|For a movie by itself, it is alright... but as a sequel to the first? Pretty much a bomb. They made changes to it that never should have been made. One, to the special effects they made them subtly more complex. Where the original effects were simpler and in my opinion better. Then they changed not only the devil but his name! Then where they left off in the first, they changed the meaning of it in the second (remember, the ghost rider was going to get even and fight the devil or whatever? Not in this one). They changed his attitude to an extent. I was not impressed by this one. But to each their own.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I got this as a gift for Christmas and I thought \\"Oh awesome, a controller with nice grip support and better triggers\\". Boy was I wrong. This controller is alright, if you like the huge dead-spot in the analog sticks. They make any first person shooter or even third person shooter a living nightmare. You waste ammo and miss all over the place, and cannot snipe anyone for the (digital) life of you. The swapped sticks are kind of nice if you are used to an xbox controller, or a gamecube controller, of which I own the later, and I love the gamecube controller, still do. I think it's the best controller design ever made,  but this controller has no excuse to feel somewhat awkward. A few good things about it do exist though. The textured grips feel great in your hands and definitely help out when intense gaming arises. And the glowing X, O, [], ^ are a nice touch, the start and select buttons are a little small, but it's not a deal breaker. The triggers have a nice feel to them, but I have somewhat large hands and they sometimes feel a tad small, but for normal hands I'm sure they're fine. Overall, this is a 3.5 out of 5 for me. I play RPG, shooters, racing games, fighters, and I can say this controller would only really be good for fighters because they never require sensitive analog stick movement, just a lot of button-mashing style gameplay, while every other gaming genre requires precision, something this controller does not offer. Just thought I'd bring what I feel needs to be brought to the table. May your gaming be fun and/or intense always!<br />-Dylan
B005P3NPXG|5.0|This was my second Seal CD, purchased with \\"Soul\\".  Great listening music, but nothing to put you to sleep.  Would purchase more products from him.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I am having so much fun with this app. Downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire and haven't stopped playing with it. You don't have to be musically inclined to use this - it makes anything you do sound wonderful. So creative and fun - a very different and excellent choice for FAOTD. Can't wait for my kids to come home to see what they can come up with!
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I got my mom the Kindle Fire and this Malware case back in December. The case is ok. a bit pricey but overall she likes it. However, last week she noticed a small pinhole in the screen, like air had been trapped inside the screen. When we removed the kindle it was severely warped on the bottom and the screen was pulling away. The Kindle may have been overheating. I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed this problem with this case, or was the Kindle itself defective?
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I find this game really fun. Sure its a lot like Mario but those kind of games are really fun and remind me of my childhood.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is very well done. I can't wait for more from this developer! Great way to test the mind.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great game fun to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wish it was easier to find friend other then hugging facebook friends to join.  great game though.  my fav to play right now.
1936850028|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book. I just started cross country skiing, and am now looking forward to another year on skis.  I am more of a runner, biker type athlete and can relate to the many stories that Walter writes about in this book. The book is very positive, fun, down to earth and really hits home for me as I live in Wi near where some of this was written about. I smile when I reflect on some of the various chapters, the marathon chapter, and many others...there are things that you think about when you are a competitive athlete and that relates with me. Fun read. FIVE STAR. I really recommend buying a copy for a friend if they are a runner, skier or other. would be a great gift item!
B007R41E8O|1.0|After endless download time, it wouldn't run. Started up and then went to colored blocks. Contacted Amazon and followed their instructions. Still wouldn't work. Disappointing as I was looking forward to playing after great reviews.
0545265355|5.0|This was exactly what I wanted. Perfect condition and I loved every second of it. I recommend it to everyone!
B003O86FMW|5.0|These books just get better and better. If you thought the Hunger Games was good you will be amazed with Catching Fire!!!
B0061S0A64|5.0|I just got this app as the Free App of the Day.  This is a very good music app.  Didn't expect a lot when I read the description on Appstore,  so I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />NodeBeat is a music creation app.  It allows anyone to be able to produce music very easily. The way that the app works is that you have two things : nodes and notes.<br /><br />Nodes are like sources of energy for the music.  They generate a pulse.  Notes are what determines the way it plays out and sounds.  You play around with your configuration of nodes and notes to create music.<br /><br />There is also an option to record your music as a WAV file.  Another option is a sleep timer so you can let the music play for a set time.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with NodeBeat.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I read Slammed in one day. It was not my intention to read the entire book in one day, but I was hooked from the beginning to the end. I could not put the book down! I laughed out loud multiple times and also shed a tear or two. Don't miss out on this great read!!!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|The case is beautiful. If I had a different kindle model, I would definitely keep it. It doesn't fit my Kindle Fire very well. In fact, the manufacturer packaging says it's made for the regular kindle, but will fit the kindle touch, etc. It does not say that it will fit the kindle fire. I had to force the straps to fit it, almost to the point of breaking them. When I set it down, the cover doesn't close completely (doesn't lay flat). So I tend to lay it face down. I will be looking for a new case, even though I love the look and feel of this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|just like tinyville with a minigame like fruit ninjas wat could be better.  recommend it for every one. easy to get to new levels and easy to get money and real money which is acorns in the game great game I think u should get it.
0345803485|5.0|This book was exciting. Couldn't put it down. Very hot and steamy! Naturally I went on to read the entire trilogy. Each book better than the last! I cannot wait for the movie! It's definately a \\"must read!\\"
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun and very addicting....I found it hard to put down. The use of movie and game is wonderful.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This would've been a 5 star game for me but something happened overnight where it took away some of the tasks I already completed and making me redo them. And now everything is taking 100's of hours to be able to collect off of. It's also froze up several times prior to this. The overall concept of the game is fun if you like ville type games. I've never had any probs with energy again it's a ville type game you are going to run out at some point..... I'd be sad to do it but if the game continues to act up I will remove it. Not worth the frustration no matter how entertaining I find it.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Gosh I am a fan for good. Cutest guys with the best moves, great lyrics and beautiful singing... Love the big band aspect to their music. A+

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Have been using splashtop for a few months now.  Works great for work or home.  Thanks for developing this product.
0310263670|1.0|This DVD is in Aramaic just like all the other DVD's with English subtittles. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!!!!!!! The movie is awesome though, historical and I beleive to be very true. If you have not seen it, it is a MUST see. Just note before you purchase it that you have to read the words unless you speak that language.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Modern Family is hilarious. I didn't catch on until season 2, so I had to purchase season 1 to get caught up. Great characters, great plot, great acting, even the younger stars.
0340980923|5.0|I loved it so much I can't wait to read the next one. Sometimes dystopian books are predictable but this one had some twists that I did not expect.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|very useful tool for everyday use.  love having it sync with phone tablet and computer.  makes life a little more manageable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved reading this trilogy.  I bought the first book to see what all of the hype was about.  I was hooked; which promopted me to purchase the other 2 books. The story line was amazing. As a reader you were taken on the emotional journey with the characters. It was hard to put the books down once you started reading them. This is a must read!  Thanks! E.L.James
0375420525|5.0|Excellent book, arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />Definitively a book differing from most books these days, it takes a diffrent approach to narrative.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  The writing is wonderful as usual. You feel like you're experiencing the story along with the characters. One of my new faves.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I truly enjoyed reading this trilogy. I normally do not enjoy YA novels, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It was exciting and I had a hard time putting it down, I just had to know how it ended. They certainly aren't the most well-written novels, and I do find them lacking just a little bit when it comes to character development, but it was a fun and easy read. I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to sit with a book and let their mind wander off into it.
0062082353|5.0|An awesome, gripping story. Chris Kyle truly is an American Hero. This is one of the best books I've read in recent years, and, was followed with many re-readings, trying to find every little detail I could about event in the book. It's worth the money, and you'll be thankful you read it
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really fun game! Got it as a free app of the day and it is addicting. A lot of great levels! Definitely worth a try.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|6 year old loves it... Not hard to get out of like others are saying just go to settings pull tab pops back up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|classic solitaire. Is there any way to make it a double tap on the cards to go to the best place? I accidentally hit it once and it automatically goes. I would much rather have to double tap on case of an accidental tap.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is one of the best out there. It is the perfect pocket Bible. I love how it provides different translations at your fingertips.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I got hooked on the \\"Jack Reacher\\" series and have read every one. Lee Child is now one of my favorite authors. I got to know him through the \\"Pendergast\\" series.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|What was the developer thinking???  There's no intuitive (or any other) way to exit the app without turning off the device (Kindle Fire). My child loved the game, but under the  circumstances I had no  choice but to uninstall the app permanently. Buyer beware!!
B003204MQS|1.0|...ever crafted by pseudo movie-makers. E[...] trying to recover $14.00 and the 3 hours I spent watching this crap and wishing for something scary, exciting, interesting or at least funny to happen but no luck.<br />Memorably, it's the worst movie I watched in my entire life. It is unfortunate that so many were impressed by this and keep spending money to watch the sequels. If I had known THIS could work, I'd had already made my own pseudo-film inside my apartment and probably gone more creative.<br />What-a-crap. Wow. They probably spent $500.00-$1000.00 total and traded crew work for school credits. LMFAO, deserves a parody. This, I'd watch.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|What I got was a case that was cracked in more than one place, a burn mark on it and very scuffed up. It was so bad that I replaced it with one of my own CD cases. The CD itself has scratches all over it. I'm surprised that it didn't skip anywhere.
B006JD48NM|5.0|This film is a must-see for racing fans as well as anyone who enjoys a good biography.<br />I saw some complaints on here of issues with versions of the DVD not playing on some players.  I have a two year old bluray player and had no trouble with playback.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|one can never predict how a musician will perform in their later years, but rest assured that LC has kept his edgy insightful lyrics sharp as a razor. i am enjoying the whole album.
B004R1VXYU|5.0|I'm a die hard skynyrd/allman brothers fan and really love good rocking southern rock.This album matches up with anything the two veteran bands ever did.It's that good!Buy this cd.The more you listen to it the more you like it.In my opinion it's an instant classic.Great guitar work,great vocals and some of the freshest ballads to come out in years.My only complaint is that they aren't touring anywhere near the northeast.If you guys ever get up to Boston I will be there.
B005KR6OBM|3.0|I was so excited to receive these DVDs that i immediately played Disc 1 of Season 1. The problem with that was, Disc 1 would not properly play. When I looked at hte back of the disc, it was \\"sprayed\\" with some purple thing that would not come off. It was not any type of scratch and I cannot tell what it is. All I know is that the DISC WILL NOT PLAY!!!!!
B003YTLKTE|5.0|I rented this because I'd just been to see the musical \\"Once\\" on Broadway.  It's fun to see the original material the show was based on and get more insight into how the story was created.  It's hard to believe this isn't a true story--it just FEELS so true.  It's a very touching story, very believable.  I love the dynamic between the unlikely collaborators in music.  It's a simply made movie that will stay with you for a long time.  Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this will keep you occupied for a while great for long trips and just when your bored I really enjoyed it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished the series after being glued to it while on vacation. I'm in Cozumel, but for the past 48 hours its like I have been in the Silo. Thrilling, exciting, haunting. Great read, thanks!
B00701QVVY|5.0|When you grow up listening to a band, and they are still around today as good as ever, nothing less than Respect is deserved. But I will try to be as honest as possible; Overkill is like the Napalm Death in thrash metal genre. They put out a lot of records, among those the classic ones like Under the Influence, Years of Decay, Horrorscope but then the 90's came and and for thrash metal it was difficult. But came 2000 and beyond, and especially once they got themselves a new drummer for the last three records (Immortalis, Ironbound and this one \\"The Electric Age\\"), then they really started getting warmed up again to kick ass.<br />So in other words, if you liked Ironbound, you will certainly enjoy this one. They sound absolutely great and the record is not boring. The drummer is a very very good one. You will get into the record right away with the first song \\"Come and Get it\\" and then you are in for the the electric ride. I cannot say these last 3 records replaced the classic ones mentioned above, but the classic Overkill sound is present in a major way.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is easily one of the best I've gotten from Amazon's Free App of the Day.  It's a basic platformer (ala SMB) and is quite similar.  There isn't as much in the way of powerups as the original NES classic, but it does provide the ability to walk backwards in a level, something that was certainly missing in SMB.<br /><br />Lep's World is an easy 'Yes'.  I found 5-4 to be the most challenging level.  Otherwise the game was a lot of fun.  The game control is quite easy and works well with multi-touch.<br /><br />Samsung Galaxy S 4g.<br /><br />ds
B005HSG3VK|4.0|The case does what it promised.  It is a nice lightweight shell that protects my Kindle Fire.  I really like the elastic band that slips around the case to keep it closed because it makes a nice strap around my hand to keep the Kindle from sliding out of my grasp.  The only thing I find frustrating is that it does ocassionally slip out of the grove when I try to stand it up on my desk.  Well worth the price.  Thanks
B002MQYOFW|5.0|.This book was interesting from the start.  This is just the type of book<br />I love to read, you don't want to put it down and think about it when<br />you aren't reading it.  After seeing the movie I can tell you the book is<br />100% better than the movie.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|this app would take over 5 mins just to let me play it after loading and it would not let me go to my home screen unless I activated a help lin by powdering it off 8 times!!!!! I don't recommend getting it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so beast and awesome I play it all day long ya yay yaycyay y I love it so sticking much ya ya ya
B004SN8Z2U|5.0|this is my first shoe in the whole barefoot revolution thing.it was these or a pair of vibrams. i went with these, i think they look a lot better. they fit nice and tight as they're supposed too.<br />although like the other reviewers mentioned, for some reason on my right heel, and only the right (lol), the shoe digs in a little bit. for the first couple of days a bandaid helped alleviate the problem, the shoes broke in a bit and now fit and feel much better,<br />i usually wear orthotics as i have very flat feet, but i seem to be doing very well with these as of yet. many reviews for barefoot style shoes ive seen have individuals claiming they developed arches naturally through wearing these shoes, so thats my ultimate goal,<br />i primarily wear them for gym stuff and martial arts. my vocation requires me to wear boots all day while working.<br /><br />so far so good, looking forward to see how things develop
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy the Bible app. It gives me immediate, convenient access to a Bible all the time. I can now carry a pocket sized Bible with font I can actually read. I can read or research on the go. I would highly recommend it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is a blast. Just wish it were easier to make friends. Really fun time management game. Have fun!
B000OVLBIU|2.0|I thought this movie was really bad at first but after seeing the second movie, this movie is just a bit better.<br /><br />Where to start? I usually love Marvel films so I thought I should watch this movie. Well, this movie was the first time I have ever seen Ghost Rider and learned about his character's origins. Ghost Rider is really Johnny Blaze in the day time. I think Ghost Rider isn't a bad character but I think he just average one. His powers aren't really interesting as he only has his chain and bike and his eye stare. But later he has a shotgun. So, he not that powerful.<br /><br />What interesting about this character is that he is a full human in the day time. Then, he feels all the fighting injuries that ghost rider received the previous night. Ghost Rider doesn't feel the pain or can get injured too bad, but as Johnny he could die from some injuries. So, he is all beat up in the day and is healing mostly from the fights during this time.<br /><br />That's all I really liked about the movie. I didn't really care for the fights scenes or the love interest in the movie. The bad guys that Ghost Riders fought were really bad because they were too week. Ghost Rider really didn't have to do much to beat them.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a rental and not a buy.
0718157834|5.0|a stunning book with lovable characters. Will and Louisa will stay with you for a very long time. Absolutely loved their interactions, conversations, the story line. Ms.Moyes is a very talented writer. I am waiting for the next book \\"The girl you left behind'.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Sometimes converting a fraction to a decimal to be entered into a calculator is time consuming. This app works with all fractions. I've never see a calculator do this (but I'm sure there are some out there). Great app for us fractionally challenged math guys.
B006LL0UZW|1.0|Safe your money and spend 15 min on the internet and you can find the same information in this book.
0307957934|3.0|I was hoping for a story that hewed closer to the real cloak and dagger Hedge Fund machinations than a somewhat implausible plot line. The artificial intelligence piece dealing with market forecasting to the benefit of the hedge fund is an original part, which I enjoyed. I would have preferred if the author stuck to this plot (Fear Index title conveys such a story) than venture onto the main plot line.
B006VREHRS|5.0|Fine acting,great storyline. From Jersey,and enjoyed historic political referances. The dress is true to the period. I cannot wait for the release of season 2.  Would highly recommend this film for anyone interersted in Jersey politics, the folly of prohibition, or anyone interested in the \\"Gangster\\" period in history.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I had the same problem with my kindle fire but I figured it out eventually there are still times when I have to shut offnmy kindle but that's only once in a while! this game is def worth a look
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I was a lil worried when I first downloaded it, I didnt know what to expect.  Now my 5 year old doesn't put it down.. he is even taking the time to read the inserts.
B004SIP8MK|5.0|Extreme violence is not something that is usually appealing to me but Tarantino's movies give you enough space between reality and fiction to make it interesting and you don't recognize the gore. The music in this movie is perfect as in all of his movies. He is an extremely creative director and this movie is a classic in my opinion. Volume 2 is as good or maybe even a little better.
B0073PZIYI|2.0|I was hoping these people could act, but maybe it was intentional to make them wooden. If so, I disagree with the director's intent. Plus, the writing was sooo bad and predictable. It had so much potential though - what a shame!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|force close now gotta wait 244hours for carrots what the heck people fix this. first time playbill and just gotta stick me
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Curiosity was the force that made me buy this book.  It was truly enlightening for those of us who are older and not quite so open sexually.  Really opened my eyes and imagination to the other world.  The characters were so likable I continued to read and be amazed, as well as caught up in the whole world of their associations.  I was compelled, of course, to follow them all the way through all three of the books.  Would certainly urge anyone curious into other lifestyles to read this series.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I've been a die-hard briefcase user until seeing a co-worker with this backpack.  I had to have it and it hasn't disappointed me.  Great bag for traveling and everyday use as well.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|I just want to be clear that this review is coming from someone who doesn't `get' Michael Shannon.  I don't think he's a good actor.  He annoys me.  His praised performances, including the Oscar nominated one, have always felt forced and obnoxious and awkward and quite frankly I've never liked him and usually wind up pointing my finger in his direction when explaining the `worst' part of a film.<br /><br />This film, and his performance inside of it, was amazing.<br /><br />`Take Shelter' seems to be a very divisive film.  The ambiguity that laces so much of the film, especially Shannon's character Curtis, lies at the core of that division.  You either embrace all that writer/director Jeff Nichols has to say here, or you label it a joke.  Honestly, there are few films that say more about the modern horrors of the struggle to survive quite like `Take Shelter'.  With a sharp sense of purpose, this film uses subtle imagery to pinpoint the root of Curtis's madness without every hitting you over the head with it.<br /><br />You may label my opinion a huge SPOILER, but I don't see it that way since I'm merely stating my interpretation of events, not their actual intent.<br /><br />For me, `Take Shelter' uses a looming storm to signify the pressing concern of financial instability.  Using seeming subliminal shots, Nichols highlights the weight on Curtis's shoulders from his own financial responsibilities and the fact that, as each day passes the eventual collapse of all that he has is going to take over.  His daughter has health issues that he must take care of.  His wife works hard to preserve a level of sanity in the house, but you can see the weight around her eyes of simply worrying about her future and that of her family.  Curtis sees so much on his plate and then, it all starts to unravel.  Everyone around him feels like an enemy as he envisions an incoming storm that will devastate and destroy.  Through dreams he experiences the pain of losing his daughter through odd means and this, for me, further implicates the idea that his floundering ability to provide for his family is what is aching at the core of Curtis's mental state.<br /><br />He's slowly going crazy.<br /><br />Michael Shannon is superb here.  Friends of mine had likened his performance to that of Heath Ledger's in `Brokeback Mountain' (every word, a struggle) and I get that.  It is so impeccably rendered.  The scene where he opens the storm door alone is just \\"wow\\".  You can see the relief etched with utter confusion all over his face.<br /><br />HOW CAN THIS NOT BE REAL?<br /><br />Jessica Chastain has had a banner year, and this is probably her finest performance.  I mean, she finds every ounce of emotional compassions here and pushes them forward in the most honest of ways.  Nichols works wonders with the air here, creating sharply intensified atmosphere that really keeps the viewer locked into what is going on.  That ending is brilliant (I know, so many gripe there but seriously, the ambiguity isn't so hard to cut through it you think about it) and the visuals are impressive.  Those storms are eerily reminiscent of our own personal demons.dd means and this, for me, further implicates the idea that his floundering ability to provide for his family is what is aching at the core of Curtis's mental state.<br /><br />He's slowly going crazy.<br /><br />Michael Shannon is superb here.

B005J32Y6Q|5.0|Id never really seen a full lords of the dance show and had only seen it being performed at gala evenings etc so i wondered how they were going to pad out a whole show. Wonder no more as the show was spellbinding from start to finish with excellent 3D and a scorchingly clear 7.1 audio soundtrack, i will watch this again and again as it gives goosebumps every time, absolute perfection!
B006PTL1QM|3.0|There have been accusations heaped upon `A Dangerous Method'; that it is too kinky.  It's not.  There have been accusations on Keira's performance; that it is too over the top.  It's not.  No, the kinky nature of the film is far tamer than the initial trailer and or mere synopsis would have you believe, and all of Miss Knightley's jaw jutting theatrics fit perfectly in tone with her character; the real life Sabina Spielrein and thus feel naturalized and appropriate.<br /><br />Sadly, debunking these accusations doesn't make `A Dangerous Method' any better of a film.<br /><br />David Cronenberg is a director I have a hard time with.  He's just not as consistent as I'd like him to be.  I loved his 80's work, but I find that a lot of his more acclaimed recent fare has been stilted for me, rather bland and just not entirely thought through.  `A Dangerous Method' suffers from that.  The film just hangs there, without much to make it truly engrossing or compelling, and this is a shock when you consider the dynamics involved here.  This should have been a ravishing tale, yet it just feels so stagnant.  Even the kinky sex scenes feel restrained in a way that doesn't add to the sophistication of the picture (this period genre is far different that standard Cronenberg fare, and thus I assume he was shooting for Oscar here) but instead give it a dull varnish.<br /><br />Fassbender delivers his weakest performance of the year, yet Mortensen is gold and Knightley proves yet again that the haters can hate all they want, but she is a great actress.<br /><br />Still, `A Dangerous Method' is missing that spark.  The costumes are good, the sets are compelling and the overall ensemble (Sarah Gadon and Vincent Cassel are also sublime) is fantastic, but Cronenberg drops the ball here.  It's like he tried too hard to shy so far away from his signature style that he became a poor man's Merchant Ivory.  I love Merchant Ivory films (do I ever), but Cronenberg is not suited for this genre.<br /><br />He really should have revved this up some, for narrowing down his signature chaos to a theme this organic could have led to a stunning film.r /><br />He really should have revved this up some, for narrowing down his signature chaos to a theme this organic could have led to a stunning film.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game for my kids. its great to see their imagination at work and they just love the little movie clips.

B005HI4LMS|5.0|This is seriously a great movie! Me and my husband were bored one night and we have netflix so we saw this movie and thought why not. When it first starts it looks like its going to be soo boring and stupid. After the first 10 minutes it is just amazing. It is hilarious!!! You have to see this movie if you like horror/comedy movies! You won't regret it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I started playing and I couldn't stop. the game play is fun and addicting. I played it for two hours and still am this is awesome

I totally enjoy MASTODONs 4 first albuns!!!!!! as others said...MASTODON will be remenbered as a METAL giant in the future....right next to METALLICA, PANTERA, SLAYER.....WELL DONE, MASTODON!!!!!BRAVO!!!!!
B0037VIBGY|5.0|I simply can't say enough about this film. (I've never felt the need to write a movie review before, but I think this movie deserves the effort).<br /><br />The first time I watched Bronson, I was completely blown away - so much so that I immediately rewatched it (about 4 more times to be honest!) and bought it the next day. It's a completely unique, mind-trip of a movie that will leave your mind absolutely reeling. It'll make you realize just how talented of an actor Tom Hardy truly is; his performance is one of the best I've ever seen in my opinion, and you can see that he takes the role very seriously. Really, everything about this movie works - it's a perfect blend of dark humor, violence, art and drama. Once you see it, you'll fall in love. It's raw, real and bold as all get out. Plus, the music is fantastic.<br /><br />If you are a true movie lover, this movie is a definite must-see.
B0000DDAU9|5.0|MASTODON[s incredible debut REMISSION is one of their best, and one of the best HEAVY METAL you can find in now days.....MASTODON is the best HEAVY band of this new millenium!!!!! i really like LAMB OF GOD too, but MASTODON is THE BEAST now!!!!! REMISSION is the rawest collection of HEAVY tunes from MASTODON, with gens like MARCH OF THE FIRE ANTS, WHERE STRIDES THE BEHEMOTH, WORKHORSE, BURNING MAN, TRAINWRECK, TRAMPLED UNDER HOOF and TRILOBITE!!!!!!

B004MC8CA2|3.0|This little app is good for scripture look up on the go. Unfortunately, the developers were thinking \\"Laptop at a Seminary\\" while I was thinking \\"Look up a passage on my phone while waiting for an airplane.\\" At least that's what it seems they were thinking. It's not really good for a laptop type of program. Use your Logos for that. Just remember to turn the nagging YOUVersion notifications off. It's really lame to have just finished an in depth exegetical study cross referencing your material with the Church Fathers and ancient Rabbinical sources on your laptop - only to pick up your phone and be told that you haven't read the Bible in a while. Lame.
B007P4UZ90|5.0|If you don't want the big box.... a couple of previously released and worth once watching Warner Brothers pieces...then RUSH to buy this at Target where its is exclusively sold!  It has the new 70th anniversary print as well as the two new documentaries (which I recommend one on Michael Curtiz and the other on the film) as well as hours of the essential documentaries from previous editions and commentary tracks. I think Target sells it for $19 and I picked mine up there on sale for $14.... now I can live without casablanca coasters and a poster and all that other junk in fact I bought the big set and got rid of it when I found this superlative one disc alternative!!!

B005ZUR724|5.0|This game has very clean graphics and so far I have not come by any problems. I have not had to call gameloft for any specific problem.... we are in need of an update but that does not worry me what so ever. I do recommend this for any one who needs a fine time consumer!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|A terrific way to enjoy God's message!!! This trully helps one find time for and provides the mean to dive into God's Word. It is an easy and appealing way to read a text. You can even add notes! I am convinced that this is a great tool which can be used to bring us closer to our Savior!
B004LWZW8S|5.0|This movie's special effects are superb and the storyline in good. Must own if you liked \\"300\\" Very good movie to add to your collection
0345803485|5.0|I really do not understand all of the negative reviews that have been posted because I completely love this series. I am actually in the process of rereading it after having only finishing it for the first time like a week ago. I just cannot get enough of Anastasia and Christian. I am so excited to see how they go about translating this story to film. Laters baby!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not much of a reader, a book has to grab my attention in the first chapter or two if there is any hope that it will be finished.  The first book in this trilogy had me in the first couple of paragraphs!  I read all three of them in 5 days on the Kindle app on my phone they were so good.  I didn't clean, do laundry, cook (barely worked) in those 5 days.  I couldn't put them down.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of puzzle games, but this game is great! Very nice graphics as well as smooth gameplay. Very well done.
0439023521|5.0|Fantastic. Didn't want to put it down. Took it on holiday and just wanted to sit on the beach reading all day. Great writing. Very engaging. Really felt for the characters. Can't wait to start the second book.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I've always been a fan of ERB's books included his Tarzan, Inner Earth, and Mars series so was very happy to hear that John Carter was coming out as a movie.  I was a little apprehensive before seeing it fearing that it wouldn't live up to my expectations but I was so very pleasantly happy with it.  I saw it in 3D and it was absolutely WONDERFUL and I can't wait for it to come out on dvd.<br /><br />The characters are great and  interact well with each other, the story is good and there's plenty of humor, action and romance all of which holds your attention thruout the movie and leaves you wanting more at the end.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Angry Birds taken to the next level is a complete success!  I won't get into the nature of Angry Birds, but I will say the added feature of space is fantastic!  It adds a great bit of new play styles, throwing your birds around the gravity of planets and in completely weightless environments.  The laser bird is also a great upgrade.  The entire game is considerably smoother in control and play that previous versions, and is a pleasure all around ... except for the following.<br /><br />My complaints about it: Firstly, it doesn't come with a lot of levels, yet.  They'll obviously be putting more in, as they do with all the AB games, but it's a bit slim pickings at the moment.  I'm not docking it a point for this, though, but am more frustrated that to get it on the Kindle Fire at all, you must pay for it, and at 3 times the cost of the normal mobile version.  The free version on my old Galaxy S looks and plays just as great, and Angry Birds has always scaled up well to larger screens, so I find this disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was so good! It was full of action and had such great detail. I'm already on to the second one!
0765357151|4.0|One of my all-time favorite movies is \\"I am Legend\\", so I decided to read the book by Richard Matheson. In most cases you will find that people will say, \\"The book is better than the movie.\\" In this case it's hard to compare. The reason I say this, is because the book and the movie differ in so many ways it's hard to see how they both share the same title.<br />I will have to say, the book is much slower than the movie, but if the movie had played out as the book did there would not be much to watch and virtually no dialog. I think this is the main reason for the difference between the book and the movie. In the book, most of the dialog that did go on was going on in the main character's (Robert Neville) head. Where in the movie, Robert has a companion from the get go, a dog named Sam. In the movie, this helps with the dialog from the beginning of the movie.<br />**Spoiler Alert**<br />In the book Robert comes across his companion, but later on; I will not say how he comes across his companion or what happens to his new friend because I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who might be interested in reading it.<br />Both the book and the movie share a common thread, Vampires. Not like you would see in most vampire stories, these vampires seemed to me to be more like zombies. Not really intelligent and driven by the desire to feed on fresh flesh. The only thing that holds true to the common vampire is that sun light burns their skin, but in most stories vampires are intelligent.<br />The setting of this story mostly takes place at his home, with windows boarded up and holy water splashed on the front porch. Robert dose not venture to far from his home in the book unlike the movie where he is trying to find a cure, so he tries to catch some of the vampires during daylight hours. In both the book and movie have the two same characters (Sam the dog and Ruth who he meets later in the story) that play a huge role in Roberts's life, but in different ways when it comes to the book vs. the movie.<br />In the book, Sam does not show up until later in the story and from aside from talking to himself Robert is able to have an external dialog. Robert feels obligated to heal the dog after many wounds and almost starvation. This is as far as I am going to go about Sam, because I don't want to ruin it for anyone else who wants to enjoy the book.<br />Ruth also comes to Robert towards the end of the story, but as I said earlier they she plays a role in the book that is against Robert, were in the movie she was in it for humanity. Again I don't want to get into her role because I don't wasn't to ruin the story for anyone else.<br />Overall the structure of the book flows evenly and the chapters were there to separate the next chronological even in the story. All though there was not much dialog, except what was going on in Roberts head, the story was one of those that are hard to put down because at the end of each chapter Matheson left a cliff hanger. If the reader is trying to follow the story from the movie or vice versa, s/he will be disappointed.o the book vs. the movie.<br />In the book, Sam does not show up until later in the story and from aside from talking to himself Robert is able to have an external dialog.

B002XTXFU8|5.0|I don't think Tom Hardy has done a bad movie. This is perfect. Became a fan of Nicholas Winding Refn after watching this, and Drive was one of my favorite movies of 2011.
B0041VV03A|5.0|The movie does a jarring, engaging, and impressionable job of exposing the disturbing consequences (with a nod to potential benefits) when companies/individuals start mucking with nature.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This gane is a lot of fun. I don't understand all the upset about closing the program. It is rather simple. Open the menu on the bottom left hand of your screen and the system menu shows up along the bottom. (Home, back, menu, etc.) So far the game is enjoyable. Being as it is a F2P game, the game makes as many attempts as it can for you to purchase in game currency with real money. If you have any sort of patience, you wont need to.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|I recent;y went to see the National in a small venue in Seattle, WA.  It was a great concert with a special bonus at the end of them signing a cappella.  After the concert I turned to the friend who took me there and said what is there best album right now for purchase.  She recommended this.  I do not know what the other albums sound like but given the quality and engagement from this album I will definitely be purchasing others.
B006Y9BULE|4.0|This watch is gorgeous, very serious looking, heavy diver watch.<br /><br />This is my preferred watch style and I couldn't believe it when I saw a solar, 200 m version, with a Chronograph, so cheap.<br /><br />I bought this as a replacement for sports for a fraction of the cost of repairing my Tag Heuer, plus the Seiko has solar mechanism and allegedly a chronograph which my old Tag did not.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Arrived in 24 hr in a nice brand new case,<br />- I was able shorten the bracelet to my size in 2 min with a cheap tool I bought also on Amazon (SE JT6226 19-PieceS Watch Tool Kit)<br />-The stainless Steel bracelet looks nice and is not very heavy (leave that for the watch)<br />- Luminescent indicators maintain nice light in the dark for the main dial (indicators of the small dials however cannot easily be seen in the dark)<br />- Solar powered!!! and charges in minutes for 6 months (according to the instructions)<br />- Bazel looks great and runs very smooth. Works better than my Tag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Chronograph does track sections of a second (5), but sections do not show in any of the three small dials (they measure 24 hr, 60 min, and 60 seconds).<br />- Chronograph is also difficult to operate since you need to unscrew the two buttons prior to use it, and it is not easy to do it.<br />- Thick and heavy.  For certain sports the extra size makes it uncomfortable at times but you get used to it (I play golf with it).<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br />EDIT 12/2014<br /><br />Almost 2 years later, the watch still works nicely and I have used it for sports often.  It never lost its battery even though I often switch to other watches and leave this on the drawer for a few weeks.  Somehow the white dot on the bezel fell off at some point.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I thought that this was a great game, it would be nice though to have more Scratch Shorts in the &quot;movie theater&quot;.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Titanic (Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy + UltraViolet Digital Copy)<br /><br />Blu-ray<br />Buy new: $44.99 $21.99 ($21.99 is the advertised price for this \\"pre-order\\".)<br /><br />If this DVD is available for pre-order, how did it garner 2261<br />customer reviews?  I have the original DVD which is how I gave<br />this \\"pre-order\\" it's four+ stars.<br /><br />And, I just recently bought from Amazon the Panasonic 32\\" flat screen LCD plus the Panasonic DMP-BDT320 Blu-Ray/DVD player so it will be interesting to see the difference between the initial release and the \\"pre-order\\" release.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|i SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN IT ORIGINALLY WAS RELEASED. The story is very good and of course the music is wonderful. I enjoyed watching it again. It was especially a treat to hear the music.The acting was very well done also. Kevin Costner  and Whitney Houston did  a fine job.

193413712X|2.0|This book leapt from obscurity to popularity when it won the 2010 Pulitzer.  Unfortunately, however, the words did not leap from the page for me.  The author flits between third person and first person, and between present and past tense, even when describing the same time period.  I felt as though he were experimenting, and somehow the book went to press before he had a chance to clean it up.  Speaking of cleaning it up, there are several typos, especially surprising in a price-winning book that is so (mercifully) short.  The writing was a little too Joycean for my tastes, with interminably long sentences, and I generally lost interest mid-sentence, thus losing track of the author's point as well.  George is a dying, old man, with his family gathered around him, awaiting his passing.  He thinks back on his life working on clocks, but the book is equally about his father, Howard, who abandoned his wife and children to avoid being institutionalized for epilepsy after one particularly dangerous seizure.  The author appears to have an ulterior motive with his emphasis on timepieces, especially with his periodic announcements of how many days, minutes, hours George has left to live--sort of a countdown to death.  The book also contains several mentions of a clock's escapement, possibly alluding to the several escapes that characters in the novel make.  George runs away to a friend's barn when he discovers that his father is about to be sent away, and Howard runs away to avoid being committed and starts a new life.  Howard's father was also an absent parent, having been committed to the madhouse himself, and then George makes the ultimate getaway by dying.
B0061S0A64|4.0|great game it really is but it sounds exactly the same every time you do it kind of like a dog barking or a sneeze. ohh and shouldn't it be NOTEbeat not &quot;node&quot;beat
B006ZZANFG|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best live performance from Loreena McKennitt. I have the discontinued DVD/CD 3 disc set. Actually, if you get a chance to watch the video, you will see the array of obscure instruments and the musicians who keep them alive. This set covers songs including up to An Ancient Muse. This is the CD to buy if you are new to her material, consider it a \\"greatest songs\\" release. This performance is wonderful, not a sour note in the entire show. One thing that is interesting, both Marco Polo and The Old Ways sound much better here than on the studio releases. If you already own a stack of her releases, as I do, this is still a worthwhile addition.

Thank you Rhonda Byrne for re-introducing the world to gratitude :)

0452277752|3.0|This is a review only for the novella Rage.<br /><br />A little preface: I've taken it upon myself to read every King book in chronological order in an attempt to further understand the man who has largely shaped how modern day America looks at written horror. I knew about Richard Bachman. However, I didn't know about the controversy surrounding this and thus ran into a bit of a stumbling block when it came up on my list. Luckily, a friend had it.<br /><br />If I hadn't known this was Stephen King in disguise, Rage could've fooled me. It's nothing like his other work. It's not bad...but I don't really want to call it good, either. It's just...strange. Very strange. It kind of reads like early Chuck Palahniuk. For reference, he's the guy that wrote Fight Club.<br /><br />It definitely got better near the end, and I'm glad it was just 130 pages. I couldn't imagine it going on for much longer than it did. Honestly, I kept wondering how it was going to make it to that 130 page mark at the rate it was going. But King made it work, in that weird way that he always seems to. Except for Carrie. The more I think about Carrie, the more I don't like it.<br /><br />So, as it stands, Rage was strange. And very grim. And I can see why it was pulled from the shelves.<br /><br />On to The Stand.
B005SLS3ZU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I find Michael Connelly an excellent writer of mystery and suspense and they are easy to follow he does not take you in all directions but does make you think about what is happening and who is guilty.
B000OCXI3K|4.0|Our book club read for March.  Enjoyable. Had a great discussion about the book. Even went over the movie version.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book shows how power can corrupt. The ability to use a reality show to frighten a populace into submission is scary. Yet we see its power even now; Reality shows are starting to invade our society with an editors mores and fears and taking over common sense,<br />There is a need to fact check what we are hearing. I enjoyed the book and  agree with the author that we need to stand up for what we believe in, and be willing to  voice that opinion no matter what the general populace and  our leaders feels is the better  way.<br />I wish when the book is read by young people that it is discussed and doors and windows are opened to their young minds to make them think and form their own opinions.
B0061S0A64|5.0|What a great app!  I've only just started fiddling with it, but it is definitely creative and fun.  This a wonderful choice for the app of the day, thanks!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I feel Book one and two could have been one book.<br /> Book three shows when one fights for freedom you need to be careful  who you choose to be your new leader.<br /><br /> When you give unconditional  power to one person you need to realize that power corrupts, so a person may start out with good intentions but they too may have the need to control and dictate their beliefs.<br /><br /> I enjoyed the book and understand the Authors philosophy  that  the common citizen must be ever vigilante to protect their freedoms.

0670023329|5.0|I've been pretty obsessed with anything North Korean related for a few years now. I'd watch countless Youtube vids of the \\"showpiece facade\\" capital city, defectors' interviews, North Korean amusement park vids, tourist videos, North Korean police barking orders, North Korean restaurants outside of North Korea, and even the \\"snuck in\\" public execution vids.  It's pretty heart-wrenching already just to revisit the countless videos of starving people. (For a \\"hermit\\" kingdom, it's a wonder that we know a lot about the country, that isn't really open to the world.)<br /><br />North Korea is almost like George Orwell's 1984, alive and still kicking in the 21st century. At this point in time, the privileged Pyongyangers now have cell phones (that can only work, most likely, within the country only).  What a quick rate of progression when over three years ago, they were introduced to American fast food (ironically).<br /><br />With all of that said, I have to say, \\"Escape From Camp 14\\" is a chilling story that you will rarely ever hear of.  Unlike other NK defector stories, this man's story is from a concentration camp. He wasn't sentenced to imprisonment for being in there.  He was literally raised in the camp from a very young age and didn't know much about the outside world.<br /><br />Do we have to literally understand what's going on inside this man's head? From my viewpoint, I don't think it's necessary. If you read the words that he allowed his mother to die in that kind of way, without much of an emotional response other than a turning of the head, you have to understand that he had to bury all of his real feelings into some kind of locked box. He knew what he did was wrong, but he had to go with the flow in order to survive. Hence, some sacrifices must be made. (Noting, I never read the Hunger Game series, but I watched the movie. Watching some of it made me think of North Korea...)<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to pretty much anyone looking for a slight different kind of NK defector story. Hayden was able to capture this man's story quite well. It may not include a lot of thought-input/feelings from Shin, but the main gist of its message resonates throughout the book. I read the first several pages of the book in B&N, and it instantly hooked me in.  I do plan on purchasing the book,eventually. (Or maybe, borrow it from a library when it comes out.)

0394800184|5.0|There were some problems.  A situation. I really didn't know who was my mother. But P.D. Eastman's wonderful illustrations and sweet narrative, first printed when I was a toddler, gently answered my questions and helped me find a mother's love with the help of a small lost bird.<br /><br />This is the perfect book for a new mother (it answers her questions, too), and any small child will find the rhythm of this story endlessly reassuring, even as the book gives way through endless readings.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|Not since \\"Taxi Driver\\" has there been so glorious a paean to the poetry of driving as the appropriately titled \\"Drive,\\" a film that received a standing ovation when it was unspooled at the Cannes Film Festival in 2011.  Indeed, the film is an homage of sorts to Scorsese's 1976 classic as well as to its iconic lead character, Travis Bickle.<br /><br />As Ryan Gosling's unnamed character cruises hypnotically along the streets of downtown L.A., he seems all of a piece with his vehicle - almost as if it were an extension of him or he of it. For Gosling, driving is clearly both an obsession and an art form and he brings to it all the finely-tuned grace and immersive concentration of a symphony conductor or a prima ballerina. Taciturn almost to the point of inarticulateness, Gosling's character only comes fully alive when he's behind the wheel of a car. Indeed, almost a full quarter-of-an-hour of running time elapses before he speaks a word, and even then - and indeed throughout the course of the film - it's only to utter some banal commonplace or half-articulated thought. Language cannot convey his feelings, the sense of who he is; only driving can. Speech serves a strictly utilitarian function for Gosling, but driving speaks to his soul. And, appropriately, both his jobs - that of an assistant mechanic at a local repair place and a daredevil stuntman for the movies - involve working with cars to one extent or another. And, oh yes, he also sells his services as getaway driver for an assortment of sleazy armed robbers willing to pay his price and play by his rules.<br /><br />This last fact is what winds up causing problems for the character, when he falls in love with an attractive neighbor (Carey Mulligan) whose husband gets paroled from prison early on in the movie. But the direction the story takes with this plot turn is not what you might expect, thanks to an intelligent screenplay by Hossein Amini based on James Sallis` novel of the same name.<br /><br />Gosling's character fits comfortably in the mold of Travis Bickle - a morally ambiguous yet righteously angry antihero who defends innocent women and children against the evils of the world while freely crossing over that line himself. And at times he seems almost as mentally unhinged and psychotic as Bickle himself does. Yet, Gosling also runs the risk of inadvertently endangering both himself and those he cares about with his actions.  The dual nature of the character is evident throughout the picture in the radically different ways in which he treats the various people in his life.  Indeed, it is only with Irene and her young son, Benicio, that Gosling can be unconditionally and stoically tender - in stark contrast to the methodical brutality with which he dispatches the numerous enemies who are out to get him (be forewarned: the violence in the film can be unnervingly graphic at times).<br /><br />Perpetually clad in a silver racing jacket - its collar turned up and a giant scorpion printed on the back - Gosling delivers his most indelible screen performance to date. Largely denied the tool of dialogue to define the character, Gosling is forced to rely almost exclusively on facial expressions and body language to convey the man's thoughts and feelings at any given moment. And he does an award-worthy job, for he commands our attention every split second of the time he is on the screen - which is virtually always.  He's like a muted vortex drawing us into the heart of the character.<br /><br />The superb cast is rounded out by a hirsute Bryan Cranston (\\"Breaking Bad\\") as the owner of the shop where Gosling works; Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman (\\"Sons of Anarchy\\") as mob bosses looking to hire Gosling to be the driver for a stock car they're planning on purchasing; and a barely recognizable Christina Hendricks (from \\"Mad Men\\") as a moll who gets in over her head on one of Gosling's \\"jobs.\\"  Heck, even Russ Tamblyn, of \\"West Side Story\\" fame, makes a cameo appearance!<br /><br/>Those who criticize the film for being too arty and Gosling's character for being too taciturn seem, to me, to be missing the point entirely. First, he is inarticulate precisely because he has found a means of expressing himself (i.e. driving) that doesn`t require conventional language. (In fact, wouldn't that criticism eliminate all silent movies automatically?) And, second, like a fine wine, the movie can be savored strictly on the basis of its aesthetic qualities (\\"The New World\\" is a similar film that comes to mind). We are transported to a different world through the sheer beauty of the imagery and pacing, the mesmerizing performances, the hypnotic and smoothly flowing tracking shots (kudos to cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel), the haunting score (more kudos to Cliff Martinez) and canny soundtrack choices.<br /><br />As a director, Danish-born Nicolas Winding Refn is clearly a filmmaker to the manner born, demonstrating a command and mastery of the medium that leaves one breathless with admiration and awe. For \\"Drive\\" is a movie that revels in its own being.  And that makes it a special treat for anyone sophisticated and savvy enough to appreciate its cinematic richness./>Those who criticize the film for being too arty and Gosling's character for being too taciturn seem, to me, to be missing the point entirely.

B005LAIH9K|4.0|When \\"American Pie\\" came out in 1999 it was a box office smash. It was a movie that cost $10 million and banked over $235 million. That was enough to spawn two legit sequels and two not-so-legit sequels. The two legit sequels, \\"American Pie 2\\" & \\"American Wedding\\", in my opinion, failed to capture the magic of the first movie. \\"American Pie\\" was about high school kids, teen angst and sexual exploration but the thing that put it over the top was the honesty and truthfulness behind it. They weren't afraid to tackle taboo subjects, but they did it with honesty. The sequels relied too heavily on the angst and gross out jokes.<br /><br />Another thing \\"American Pie\\" did was make stars out of Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Alyson Hannigan, Shannon Elizabeth, Tara Reid and Seann William Scott. All of them rose to quick fame and some of them, Hannigan (How I Met Your Mother), have managed to hang onto that fame or increase it. Some of them have fallen right off the map, so it was a perfect time for a sequel and a return of the old cast. They are all back and sure, they all needed career boosts, but they also came back for good reason. The script for \\"American Reunion\\" is better and the audience that came to the original movie grew to love the characters.<br /><br /> There are jokes that are rehashed from the original and the raunchy nature of the films is completely intact, but more importantly the writers remembered the truth and honesty that pushed \\"American Pie\\" over the hump.  Of course the laughs were important as well.<br /><br /> The best part about \\"American Reunion\\" is that they gave veteran actor and SCTV alum, Eugene Levy (Splash, Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show), a big part in this one. Having been a widow for the past three years, he's content with his Sudoku and nights at home alone until his son returns for his 13-year class reunion. Once out of the house, he steals the show.<br /><br /> \\"American Reunion\\", much like the entire series, isn't for everyone. It is offensive and at times gross, but at the same time it manages to be poignant and truthful. It is an entertaining film with all the characters returning 13-years later in real life as well. We all need our friends and if you were invested in the characters 13-years ago, you won't want to miss this either.offensive and at times gross, but at the same time it manages to be poignant and truthful.

0446572993|4.0|Will Robie is a loner, he's precise, and he's a hit man who takes out America's enemies.  In the first 50 pages or so we go along with Robie on a few of his missions but the next one goes horribly wrong and now he's being hunted by some scary folks.  On his escape he teams up with a 14 year old named Julie Getty who's just left foster care only to witness the murder of her beloved parents.  She narrowly escapes the killers.  In \\"The Innocent\\" Baldacci takes us all over the globe and into international politics including current and past wars.  He also explores what makes us human and how things we do can change us.<br /><br />On his quest Robie has the help of some former co-workers and FBI agent Vance but he's having trouble getting the pieces to fit.  Are the bad guys after him or after Julie or both of them?  Is this about his past or hers?  He keeps looking through his last cases trying to find who and why someone is hunting him, at the same time he tries to figure out why people who knew Julie's parents keep dying.  I know it's a clich&eacute; to call a book a page turner but this one really is.  Baldacci drops enough clues to make you feel like you're in on the hunt but just when one plot point becomes clear another mystery pops up and the story takes off again.  I'm not usually a thriller reader but Baldacci might have me hooked after reading \\"The Innocent\\".<br /><br />This review is based on an e-galley provided by the publisher.

I recieved it yesterday, and spent a wonderful evening pouring over the beautiful illustrations and inspiring projects.  I especially enjoyed the chapter on design.  As a self taught beader, I am a HUGE fan of the Lark Master Class series, having spent many hours learning from instructors whose classes I don't have access to without a lot of travel.  I am glad to say that this latest installment totally lives up to the excellence that I expect from Lark publishing.  I have already started making my shopping list for the projects in this book, and will be at my local bead store within the week!!
B005LFQRTC|5.0|One advantage of being sick, is lying in bed watching TV.  The Six Million Dollar Man was just before my time, but I had watched a few re-runs.<br /><br />The initial movie is good, but slow.  It could have been trimmed back pretty easily.<br /><br />The 2nd and 3rd movies just don't work.  Steve Austin, James Bond style super-spy isn't appealing.<br /><br />However, the first season of the TV series is really good!  Lee Majors pulls off the pilot/astronaut/hero really well.  Austin, unlike many TV characters, isn't an idiot.  Two guys show up claiming to be guides, Austin tells them, nicely, to get lost!  Most TV characters would just blandly go along with the bad guys.  Goldman is much more human in the TV show, and you can really believe he and Austin are friends.<br /><br />Love having English subtitles on the shows.<br /><br />This is also one of the few TV shows that I watched all of the special features on.  There is a long interview with Harve Bennett that is really worth listening to.  Not just because he agrees with me on the 2nd and 3rd movies!
B00499K9E0|5.0|The opening scenes of episode one of Sherlock caused me to wonder why I had decided to forego Jeremy Brett for somebody named Cumberbatch, and a John Watson who looked like a Hobbit.  (giggle)By halfway though the Study in Pink, I knew I would never look back.  Mystery, comedy, throw-away one-liners, and last but definetly NOT least, the most wonderful Mycroft ever conceieved!  What a great production!  Not only have I purchased it for my Amazon Instant Video library, I bought copies of the DVD for oldest daughter, whose sense of humor is as bent as mine, and for friends who are as much of Masterpiece Mystery fans as I.<br />No matter what preconceived ideas you have  when you begin watching this delightful show, they will be left by the wayside as you get to know and appreciate the Sherlock and Watson of the 21st century.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Honestly, I can't recommend this music enough! After hearing a few songs on trailers, I didn't realize you could purchase this music for yourself. I believe there was a time when they weren't offering sale to the public. That should be incentive enough to get this now!
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I must admit it was a big mistake to read this book after enjoying the honesty and detail of \\"Steve Jobs\\". Ms Fey's scar is not the only thing she does not wish to talk about. This book was more of an outline for what could be a really great read. I would have loved for her to share more experiences of a woman's journey to where she is today. I expected the book to be both empowering and funny. It was light fluff and I think Ms Fey has more to offer than that. Perhaps in time she will be more forthcoming...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm glad this book is fiction, but I'm certain that some young readers might be lured into the idea that this kind of behavior is okay if not normal if both parties are consenting. If you have sex in order to inflict pain upon someone, then you are deviant in every sense of the word, and your consenting partner is too. But, it's a free world so you can do anything you want to as long as you're willing to go before a court of law and prove your innocence with or without a \\"contract.\\"<br /><br />This book might have been a more interesting read if the dialog was diverse and stimulating, but these characters just want to shock us with as few words as possible used in a repetitive nature. Not what I look for in a book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book! It's been a long time since a book has grabbed me like this one. I read the whole thing in two days. Loved the characters so much, I hated to let them go. I ended up reading reviews, commentary, and anything else I could get my hands on just to put off having to say I was finished.<br /><br />Loved the storyline, was invested in the characters, and definitely want more. I hate to admit it, but I read so fast that I'm not sure if I missed the reason for the title? I almost passed right by this one, thinking it was going to be a fantasy about sheep or shepherds in some pastoral setting. Ha! Maybe named that because of pulling the wool over the characters eyes?? I don't know. But I do know that I am now a fan of Mr. Howey's and I will be reading anything else he has written.

B000SEJHRA|4.0|I've read several of Sedaris' books and find \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" to be the funniest and most fleshed out.  From a (painfully) awkward childhood comes a plethora of hilarious recollections and musings.  I was reading this at the Dr's office waiting for biopsy results (seriously), but people probably thought I was losing my mind, as I was guffawing like a moron.<br /><br />Sedaris' has a very unique voice and he turns the most banal life situations into one roller coaster ride of hilarity.  He also perfectly balances \\"telling\\" a story and personal reflection.  The pace and timing are always right on.  Some authors get caught up in over analyzing their own motivations, or get too bogged down in certain details, but not Sedaris.<br /><br />I blog and see many who try to emulate Sedaris' style, but there's only one David Sedaris.
B005PK1G76|5.0|i have a phil&ted's explorer and, other than theirs (which i refused to spend $30 on), no cupholders worked.  they either kept slipping or couldn't make it over the rather thick handles/frame.  this thing is great--you can make it as loose or tight as you want and it's surprisingly stable.  plus, in addition to space for two beverages, there's room to stick the random baby/toddler items that endlessly drop from the stroller (i.e. hats, socks, toys).  so wish i had found this a year ago when we got the stroller.

0143039881|5.0|I reread this classic work recently after pondering the political and economic events in the US since 2003. Its a must read for understanding all the Little Eichmanns out there in the country today who willfully assist in the disinheritance, disenfranchisement, and oppression of the working people.
0312641893|4.0|I'll admit I watched this book for a bit before picking it up. There was talk of weak world building; about the similarities between the android and cyborg conditions. But when I received the audio Cd's in the mail from fellow blogger Bookgoonie I thought, obviously, this was a sign I was meant to do this book...<br /><br />And I sooo enjoyed it.<br /><br />First off, I knew all the twists before they happened. ALL OF THEM.<br /><br />Second, this in no way hindered me from enjoying this book.<br /><br />I didn't see as many issues with the world. I loved the addition of an ancient plague (we're talking about the genesis for Ring Around the Rosie here people, the dark ages are back!). Is it wrong to say I loved the inclusion of a Pandemic? A relic from Medieval Europe rearing its ugly head. It added a desperation and a seediness to the feel of New Beijing. And it furthered a theme of ancient-meets-futuristic that played throughout the text...Though, you'll have to suspend belief for a minute that in a society as advanced as New Beijing they have yet to find a cure.<br /><br />As far as the android vs. cyborg debate. I could tell the difference. And I loved Cinder's personal android pal Iko. Iko was hilarious! By far my favorite character of the book. She was so sweet, such a good friend to Cinder. I loved that Iko was there to keep Cinder acting like a teenage girl from time to time. And to care for her in ways that the evil step-mother cliché banns the family from doing.<br /><br />The other side character that I loved was the Doctor. I thought his placement in the plot was a good one. I wasn't sure in the beginning what direction his character would take. But in the end I thought it was very smart, what Ms. Meyer did. Very interesting indeed. But I'll let you read it yourself and figure it out.<br /><br />As far as experiencing the story as an audio book I have to say I loved the character voices that the narrator did. The changes she made to her voice were justright for each character. My favorite was Iko's voice. Perfect. But the audio itself kept me really interested. The plot was rewarding. I liked that the romance with the prince was spread throughout the story (honestly `fist-pumped' while running a few times due to romantic happenings). Learning about Cinder's cyborg system and her history was peppered across the story as well...it made me want to run longer just to lean more!<br /><br />Rating: 4/5 A futuristic version of an ancient tale where eternal themes of society still sing strong.

B0057MFA42|4.0|A brief note before I begin this review. I did not come across any technical issues with this disc. I may have just been lucky enough to receive a \\"good\\" copy, but I won't be bringing any of that up during the review.<br /><br />Most spent Halloween night of 1991 at parties or at home catching a marathon of horror flicks. But for a lucky bunch of fans at the Paramount in Seattle, it was an evening of rock delivered by one of the most well-known and influential bands to come out of the 90's. That band was Nirvana, and this Blu Ray disc captures the concert in high-def goodness.<br /><br />Stringy blonde hair covering his face, Kurt Cobain gives it his all. Screaming into the microphone, one can truly see the passion he felt for his craft. Krist Novoselic interacts with the audience between songs, and Dave Grohl is very impressive as he hammers away on the drums with an intensity that would later shine through when he became the front man of the Foo Fighters. It's a thrill to see these three musicians doing what they love. They are at the top of their game here, making this concert an invaluable snapshot of Nirvana Mania which swept the nation over twenty years ago.<br /><br />The setlist is solid. Most of the band's biggest hits are performed, including \\"Lithium\\", \\"About A Girl\\", \\"Breed\\", and the radio staple \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\". There's even an early version of \\"Rape Me\\" towards the end of the show, a song which would be included on the In Utero album a few years later. There are also a few surprises thrown in. The bizarre track from their debut record, \\"Floyd the Barber\\" makes an appearance. It fits in well despite its disturbing lyrics.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the cinematography of this concert. Much like Nirvana's music, the camera work is very exciting. One often feels like they are on stage with the trio due to the use of interesting and fluid angles. The high definition transfer adds to this. While there is a large amount of grain, the picture is detailed and impressive, especially during close-ups. The sound is well mixed as well. The roars and cheers from the audience are loud and clear, as are Kurt's vocals and all instruments.<br /><br />In the extras department, this disc has nothing to offer. It's a disappointment. A documentary about this show or some music videos, maybe even a commentary by the surviving members of the band, would've gone a long way. However, the concert itself is so satisfying that this isn't a big issue.<br /><br />Over two decades since the filming of this show and eighteen years since the tragic suicide of Cobain, Nirvana remains a band with a large and passionate fan base. Their music touched a generation. With a sarcastic attitude and angst-filled lyrics which youths could embrace, Nirvana was a breath of fresh air in the music scene at the time. Even those with a passing interest in the band should pick up this Blu Ray. It's a fantastic concert, and watching it cap off with Kurt swinging around his guitar like a madman on a stage bathed in red lighting is an awesome sight to behold.<br /><br />Some say the grunge movement died with Kurt, but that special moment in rock history is forever immortalized with this disc. Highly recommended!
B0074EIQQU|2.0|Huge fan on TMV and all their other projects. Has Omar forgot he is one of the most talented guitar players today? Pick up the guitar, Omar. Too much production, is this a Radiohead album? The drums are great and Cedric sounds just as good. Omar, you need to rock!

You'll probably need/want to watch some episodes several times.<br /><br />Re: (1): The first time I saw the show was at my parents' house, and while I was literally - not figuratively - screaming like an injured lemur with laughter, my Boomer parents barely managed a polite smile. The generational divide was never so apparent.<br /><br />The show speaks directly to my generation, and not just to amuse us, but to tell us things we urgently need to hear. E.g.:<br /><br />* \\"Britta's attracted to men in emotional pain. It helps her think that she's emotionally healthy.\\"<br />* \\"Jeff, you're a normal person. There's nothing very special about you at all. You're going to be great at a few things but really crappy at many more.\\"<br />* \\"While claiming to have no religion, you're actually devoutly worshipping yourself.\\"<br />* \\"We need more respect and less passion.\\"<br />* \\"TV makes sense. It has structure, logic, rules, and likeable leading men. In life we have this. We have you.\\"<br /><br />And there's so much more that isn't easily pick-up-able from little lines of dialogue. The general message of the show is (crudely) wake up, grow up, what's important is right in front of you.<br /><br />God bless Dan Harmon. May he make many more TV shows.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Regarding Season 1 in particular, the least appealing episode is probably the first, when the series and characters are still flailing around trying to figure out who/what they're going to be. After that it's consistently very good. The high points are \\"Introduction to Film,\\" \\"Physical Education,\\" and \\"English as a Second Language.\\" And then of course there is the most epic (which is very different from saying the \\"best\\") episode of the whole series: \\"Modern Warfare.\\"lar, the least appealing episode is probably the first, when the series and characters are still flailing around trying to figure out who/what they're going to be.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|Cheers to Amazon,<br />I enjoyed this book very much; it is well written; and has a very good plot. The movie of this book is being released this week and I'll be the first in line to see this film.
0525478817|5.0|This was a great book! The plot, characters, pacing, dialogue, emotion- everything!- was so well done. I highly recommend this to teens and adults, alike.
B0055SWM08|5.0|fantastic game really keeps u occupied for those times u have to spare. you start playing this ansld time flies by really fast I really recommend buying this app
0142410705|3.0|I tried this novel because \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" was so enjoyable! \\"Katherines\\" isn't nearly as good, and I probably wouldn't bother with it. I liked the 2 main characters at the beginning, and the dialogue was interesting and funny. It just seemed to lose steam as it progressed, and one sex scene makes it inappropriate for many teens that otherwise might have enjoyed the story.
B002HMHROQ|4.0|I still have the LP that I bought back in the 80s and have wanted to get the CD for quite some time. Is this a great rock album? I find some of the songs boring but the title song is still one of the most furious songs I have ever listened to. The lyrics alone blows away the heavy metal stuff my 16 year old listens to. Plus the song \\"Women\\" is a love song to all women and about how much we men need them. This is the song that really captured me years ago because it expressed my feelings toward women.<br />Unless you are a Lou Reed fan perhaps you should not buy this but this item is a must for any Reed fan.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|Read this book in two days, couldn't put it down!  I haven't laughed this hard in a long, long time!
B0071T5PN0|1.0|Have been looking forward to this album for 20 years and knew it was coming. As time went on, I wondered how much they would change. It's not their world anymore. Tracks 7 and 8 very nearly strike home. That is all. Hope they try again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As hooked on this as I was on Eclipse series.  Just finishing the third book and I like that one also.
B007549YM4|2.0|Barely ok script, great actors unfortunate cannot overcome a really depressing slow movie. Michael Biehn delivers an outstanding performance in this movie, I personally feel that this movie is best to watch on HBO or Showtime more than a purchase.  Profanity scenes of rape & torture. All the usual characters: loudmouth, scared child, moody badass, reluctant hero.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|OK WHEN I FIRST STARTED IT WAS KINDA BORIN BUT THEN LATA I WAS HAVIN SO MUCH FUN.......................... Tara<br />omg totally kool
B007SYWFRM|2.0|At first it was tons of fun. I built a bunch of things. Then when I wanted to go to another app, I couldn't find the bottom bar on my kindle to get to my homepage. I overall had to shutdown my whole kindle and had to start it back up.  It was fun at first but I  couldn't get out of the game. that is why I gave it 2 stars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's fun for a while and you get a lot of points in the beginning but it gets harder and harder to get the points and you have to keep replaying games. nice to pass time with though I guess.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this app is copied off of Mario bros. , but is still fun and creative. it is really fun. the only thing, is the controls are a little difficult. but hey, Wat's a app without a challenge?!?
B000UX6THK|5.0|This show is brilliant. Without it, there'd be no X Files, Lost, or Fringe. I love the mystery and intrigue of the story and characters. You just keep wanting more!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Okay just to start out I play this game probably everyday but; basically all it is is a reface of super Mario brothers so if you like that game this is the game for you and oh yeah its okay a pretty good way to kill some time.
0385247125|4.0|Caution to sellers of used books. Check inside the pages before you ship out the book. Mine came with a lovely empty dirty peanut bag inside.<br /><br />The book was a fascinating read. I had read it years ago but wanted to read it again.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|It is missing a lot of the more advanced chess moves, otherwise really good for beginners to adept. Takes a good bit of data tjo
B00785P2QC|4.0|seems like a good game so far. additive and cant put it down. recommend to pass time! you will like it!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Good solid book, new character from D. Baldacci. Kind of a Jack Reacher type character. Fast read, kept my interest.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not much for lengthy reviews.  it was a good book, it entertained, I'm 44 yrs old and still enjoyed it...and i hate teenagers!!!<br />Anyway, the only thing wrong with it is that it was in kindle format only on the e-book format.<br />the story is told in 1st person narrrative from a sixteen year old girl's perspective in a post apocalyptic version of a North America that has been split into 13 districts that all are forced to provide for the \\"capitol\\" district.  As punishment for one of the 13 districts rebelling 75 years ago, the hunger games were created to entertain the capitol residents and to remind the other districts who is in control.  Teenagers will love this book.  As do many adults I suppose.
B0017YDPI2|5.0|What a great series, allways knew I would like it. Just couldn't fit it into the \\"rotation\\"! Now I am catching up and the series does not disappoint.
0143034901|4.0|The Shadow of the wind is a compelling story about a boy's adventure into a man through the help of a mysterious book. His father, a bookstore owner, shares with him of a secret place where books go to die. As he wonders through the books a certain one called The Shadow of the Wind. This book takes him through a journey to discover its original writer, which little is known about and whose books have all but been destroyed. The young boy, Daniel is taken aback by the book and its delicate words that he makes it his mission in life to find out who the writer, Julian Carax was, and why so little of his works were produced and destroyed. This leads him to his first love Clara where he comes to understand that he is still too young and there are still so many questions to be answered in the world. Through his journey to find Carax he encounters a dangerous man who has made it his mission to burn all the books. He also meets many faithful friends along the way too. One of them becomes his wife, Bea. She helps him to unravel the secrets of Julian Carax's books only to find that he is still alive. Through his journey, Daniel is forced grow up in a hard time. The Civil War has made it hard to show interest in finding people, when there are others who do not want them found. For example, Fermero, an inspector makes it almost impossible for Daniel to continue his quest in hopes of finding out more about Julian Carax and if he is indeed still alive.<br /> The plot of the book is extraordinary. It goes into details such as how the bookstore is maintained and how Daniel's father does his best to provide for his son. For example, years after Daniel had commented on a pen in a shop window that his father could not afford at the time, his father saved up to present it to him for his birthday with an engrave. Its little parts in the book like this that makes it relatable. This book carries so many emotions for the readers and can be read by old and young alike. It draws you in with such intensity in situations where Daniel walks the streets at night in the pouring rain and the description they give of the cobble stone or store fronts and what is being sold in each one. The detail when Daniel enters Carla's home for the first time is exquisite. They make you feel as though you are looking through the writers eyes and you are right there walking in his footsteps. They talk about how the light falls gently down or the garden and how it has overgrown statues in the old Aldaya mansion. It draws you in and you want to feel as though you are in the period of time and feeling what they feel.<br /> This novel was great from beginning to end and fans of The Crimson Petal and the White would enjoy this novel very much. The Shadow of the Wind proclaims a marvel in Spanish literature. An uncannily fascinating historical mystery, a heart-piercing romance, and a moving respect to the spiritual power of books, The Shadow of the Wind is an achievement of the story tellers art.such intensity in situations where Daniel walks the streets at night in the pouring rain and the description they give of the cobble stone or store fronts and what is being sold in each one.

B00756GKBA|2.0|She has been around for some time, and this should let her know she is no longer the 'IT' girl.  She has Nicki on a few songs, but that still did not help.  I listen the most of the songs, and had to remove it from my ipod, because it was taking up space that I could use for other good music.  I will be glad when she retires, or does more mature music.  Let the younger people do the uptempo dance music.  She is not a good singer, and her selections for this project are horrible.
B0044XV3QY|4.0|Received the DVD in the mail in a padded envelope. There was a dent in the edge of the DVD box that looked like it was dropped on a sharp corner before going into the envelope, leaving an indentation. No damage to discs. The Disc 1 had a fingerprint smudge and Disc 3 had minor scuffs on the disc surface probably from moving in the sleeve. The disc holder and outside case were both sealed in shrink wrap so the fingerprint probably originated from its initial packaging. My only complaint would be to the rough handling of the product in shipping. Who knows about the fingerprint?
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I watched this series when it was originally on television and absolutely love having all the episodes as one set.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty cool.  the games are quick and easy to play. it also helps to pass the time as you play.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I got this game for my kids and they love it. I also find myself playing it quite a bit. We love Mario and this is a great version!
B004UID2LC|3.0|I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire so I can check out videos about my nephews and other stuff.  It's really getting to be a pain when the app repeatedly closes either before the video starts, during or after it's over.  Especially when I'm trying to download them on my Kindle.  Please fix the problem.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game is so far pretty good. no issues with anything so far. kids will love it. it is lvery vertigo easy to play
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game.  this version is fun because I can just tap the cards and they go into the right column.  I like not having to drag the cards because I can never seem to put them in the right place. good job ya.'ll

B006I1OB0U|5.0|Downton Abbey Christmas Special is exactly that, something special. I like the direction, the camera angles, the sets and the actors. Is the dialog perfect, generally yes. Are the lines delivered well yes. The costumes look fine too. I like the characters too. I have read some other reviews of the first two seasons and it struck me that  they we good with one or too criticisms about knit picking things like dialog phrases. I say to the few glitches I can live with them as I do not live in a perfect world. People who make such criticisms are people who cannot do what they are commenting on. It is a good story, great character development, pleasing to look at and listen to.<br /><br />The story itself takes place at the turn of the twentieth century and continues to 1920 where the Christmas Special concludes; a 10 year period. It is a family's story in a time when family included not just relatives but their hired hands-servants, butlers, cooks and drivers. The family has a master and a mistress of the house with their three daughters. Each character has a matching servant. In a time when masters and mistresses were good they were very good. My family had a disaster and the owner of the large company my father worked for in the 1950's, he helped our family as well as many others. This is similar story on film.<br /><br />Like Gone With the Wind it is a tale about a nation's society, its people and all the ups and downs both move through. There are so many characters you have plenty of time to select your favorite. Like the true classic movies of the thirties, forties and fifties you could listen just to the sound track and it would work. The visuals add to this wonderfully entertaining story.<br /><br /> It is not finished at the Christmas Special as the story leaves us on one happy note and one continuing story line. In a day where entertainment is mindless sex,violence and abnormality this film is a delightful change to what a real movie should be. There is sex, some violence (WWI), love and deception and goodness. So sit back and enjoy this masterpiece.
0439023521|1.0|I don't usually jump on the \\"YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!\\" bandwagon, but everyone I knew praised The Hunger Games to the heavens and I finally decided to check it out. Just a small preface before I begin this review, I am truly sad that I did not like this book. Shocked was more like it...<br /><br />1. The Writing<br /><br />Yes, this is a young adult novel, but my pragmatic approach to any book tells me I can't suspend reality for the most basic plot devices. Not only was the writing boring, but the clichéd lines had my eyes rolling more times than I can count.<br />Furthermore, I like books where the plot is explained subtly, not the vital repercussions concerning the harsh rules of the Capitol explained twenty times. For example:<br />\\"Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one another while we watch\\" <-- this sentence should have sufficed and Collins' message will come across loud and clear. Yet, she continues--<br />\\"This is the Capitol's way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion.\\"<br /><br />The author holds your hand throughout the book, uncertain if you are capable of analyzing a basic plot. This is coming from attending a school that assigned preteens The Grapes of Wrath, Huckleberry Finn, Oliver Twist and The Giver .<br /><br />When Peeta constantly compliments Katniss, she says: \\"I don't know why, but this rubs me the wrong way.\\"<br /><br />Along that, you can expect more lines such as \\"Betrayal. That's the first thing I feel\\". Maybe it's just me, but everything is so amateur.<br /><br />2. Character Development.<br /><br />Katniss, to me, is not a likable character. Her redeeming qualities are slim to none and she is downright rude. Nothing in the novel hints at me to believe that Katniss is really the \\"Chosen One\\". All I have to believe that Katniss will save the country of Panem is through passages--<br /><br />\\"She's a survivor\\"<br /><br />\\"People will help you in the arena. They will be tripping over each other to sponsor you.\\"<br /><br />\\"She's excellent,\\" says Peeta. \\"My father buys her squirrels. He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body. She hits everyone in the eye.\\"<br /><br />The only strong suit I see for Katniss' ability to win the Games is her use of the bow and arrow as shown in the above remark from Peeta's observations. If Katniss believed her only way to survive is through the bow and arrow, then what lesson has she MORALLY learned about staying alive? That if I don't have a bow and arrow, I am nothing? The bow and arrow is also a weapon, mind you. The games would have been more interesting had a bow and arrow never showed up. The author is indirectly telling me that my true gift lies in material.<br /><br />As the Gamemakers observe the tributes' training: \\"Several times I've looked up to find one fixated on me.\\"<br /><br />And my favorite:<br />\\"She has no idea. The effect she can have.\\"<br /><br />The inevitable effect she has on people is only clear to the characters in the book, because it is lost on me. It is not enough for Collins to insert remarks such as these in the novel and expect us to believe she will save the totalitarianism of a country. I wanted to see Katniss' growth as a character for me to understand the prophetic high remarks her colleagues give her. I don't need to read the third book to conclude she has realized potential.<br /><br />Katniss is rude and that's to say the least--<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />\\"I bite my lip and stalk back to my room, making sure Peeta can hear the door slam\\"<br /><br />Example:<br />As Katniss explains why she doesn't care to listen to the history of Panem, it's because<br />\\"Whatever the truth is, I don't see how it will help me get food on the table.\\"<br /><br />The truth is what should help you fight against the system!<br /><br />My disappointment furthered, after this passage:<br /><br />\\"Suddenly I am furious that with my life on the line, they don't even have the decency to pay attention to me.\\"<br />WAIT. Was this the moment she finally realized that she could possibly die and now she does the unthinkable and upsets the Gamemakers? Collins' writing suggests the Capitol is so strict. I find it hard to believe that Katniss can get away with this.<br /><br />The other characters are not only one-dimensional, but offer Katniss no further development. Peeta does nothing to better himself or Katniss in the arena. Haymitch, who is drunk 24/7 and could not even stand during the reaping, is alert during his drunkenness to send Katniss thought-provoking gifts. Give me a break.<br /><br />3. The Plot<br /><br />I was in no hurry to finish this book. Throughout the book, I never sensed Katniss in any real danger. She cheated death on several occasions (The tall, brutal, Thresh sparing her life because of Rue, Clove not killing her when she had the chance, the hellfire, one can even argue when she shot the arrow through the apple at the Gamemakers). Collins' plot is seen as way too convenient in favor of Katniss. No true sacrifice was made. Even when she took her sister's place, she still had a chance to battle it out.<br /><br />The \\"star-crossed\\" lovers sub plot felt like a thrown away brainstorm idea, rather than something making it to the final draft. As I read, I wondered how interesting of Collins to set up Peeta and Katniss' relationship during the Hunger Games, only allowing one to survive. The twist the Gamemakers announced halfway through the book felt so trivial, I laughed in disbelief.<br /><br />I will say that the book is fast-paced, which I like and the Hunger Games concept is interesting. Yet, my disappointment surpasses the slim margin of likeness I had toward The Hunger Games.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its a very good game and highly addicting!<br />I play this game all the time now!<br />cant go wrong with it
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fantastic gaming.  Well designed user friendly interface with great graphics.  In addition to this gaming system, look for other great software options from MobilityWare.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a great game. I like being able to create my own city and design it the way I want.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game.  lots to do. loved the movies and game if fun. many differant animals that you get know. I love scrat.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game has been great fun so far. the goals are reasonable, you earn money quickly and the graphics are great on the kindle fire.
B000001F95|5.0|This was in my mother's CD collection so I gave it a listen without knowing anything about it (except that Mark Knopler is a favorite).  The hauntingly lyrical sound track was a complete surprise.  It's not from the hard driving Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits and \\"Tunnel of Love,\\" nor from the slyly funny virtuoso Mark Knopfler of Neck & Neck.  This is from a mature musician who has produced a BEAUTIFUL score -- one that bears frequent replays.  Strongly recommended.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|Knowing that this was an environmental statement I was not sure about it but I found both the film and the 3d effects very worthwhile.  One of the better 3D documentaries that I have seen and anyone who wants beautiful views of the Grand Canyon will love this.  Also I enjoyed their comparative views of the 19th Century Powell expedition stereographic pictures compared to the river today.  High recommendation for those looking for 3D product.
0061438294|5.0|\\"have always been fascinated by body language and it has come in handy at times from when I was a journalist to now, even in dealing with non-humans of the fuzzy sort!<br /><br />Recently picked this up at the library. I was at a speaking even recently and several photos were taken before and during of the event of the speakers, including me. Several photos were also taken of the audience. I found the body language fascinating, and also became determined to be more conscious of the language I am displaying both as a speaker and as a listener. The book is one of the best I have read on the subject. Most of it is about unveiling deception but who says that isn't a handy skill in every arena of life?\\"
B0055SWM08|5.0|excellent maze puzzle game. early levels are pretty easy, but that's great to help understand the game physics. i just wish there were more levels, because i finished the game fairly quickly.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a fun game allows for continuous play. not like Oregon settler where run out of energy quickly. recommend it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|has the basic Mario look and feel, but with original levels. grat fun, clean graphics, and free. really enjoying it o. my Kindle Fire.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|With only some minor changes in staging/scenery to account for the venue (orchestra on stage, adjustments to certain set pieces, and a chandelier that blows up instead of crashes), this is as close to the original 86 stage presentation as you're going to get outside of an actual theatre.  Some of the changes could even be termed improvements, such as incorporating shots of the actual Opera Garnier into the set.  The cast is great, they each bring a lot of character to their roles.  And unlike the \\"movie\\" version, this Phantom can sing.<br /><br />My only criticism (minor one) is that this recording could have benefited from some foley work (Mme Giry's cane needs to sound loud, sharp, and commanding) and some additional bits of sound work in post.  Also the menu functions are a tad annoying, but that's all minor stuff compared to finally having something that feels like the theatrical production on screen!  Well worth the money.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it great i'm glad that they put on free I love this game. this game is amazing it great on kindle fire
B005FITIK0|3.0|Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) is a 37 year old author of teen books for young adults. She has been relatively successful but she is faced with writing the last book of the series which spells the end of her writing career as she has experienced it. Most of the books have been a mixture of her past high school glory days modernized on the lingo and ideas she picks up while out in public around younger people.<br /><br />She gets an email from the wife of her old boyfriend in college about the birth of their new baby. She is filled with jealousy and a sense of loss over what might have happened if she had stayed with her old love and married him. Her divorced life and one night pick up dates seems to be a sad comparison to the possible joy she might have had if her and Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) had gotten married.<br /><br />She jumps out of bed from a one night stand and drives back to her old town to get Buddy back and show him what life with her could really be like if he left his wife and child...<br /><br />This is a sad and dark story about an alcoholic middle aged woman who is deeply depressed and she doesn't know how to go on with her life. She wants to relive the glory days of her teen and college years to regain the joys of living. This movie is extremely well acted and Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt who portrays Matt Freehauf do a wonderful job of acting the roles of middle age people still stuck in their younger years.<br /><br />What kills this movie is that it is just such a depressing storyline. There are some parts that are a comedy and Charlize is as hot as usual but the storyline is just downright gloomy about how people can be so miserable with their lives. It is a storyline about human nature but don't expect to watch this movie and feel like laughing. You will feel the pain of the two main characters and feel like you wish you could help them somehow.
B00104W8T6|4.0|This CD came in fair condition, it had a slight crack in the case, but with shipping that is to b expected sometimes.<br /><br />The CD itself was alright. It has a few awesome and timeless songs on it, and was worth what I paid for it.
B004LWZW8I|3.0|The titans are contained in an ancient box and locked in place for all time. King Hyperion in the year 1228 BC wants to release them and wreak havoc on the world of mankind and pit the titans against their ancient enemies the gods. This is a story based on Greek mythology, sort of. It is as much made up as it does not follow the ancient tales and the story line seemed to wander as the mixture of ancient history and modern script writing get intermingled.<br /><br />Theseus is a protagonist that comes from humble peasant background who is educated and trained by the god Zeus disguised in human form. He is mankinds and perhaps the god's last hope for survival from King Hyperion and the titans. This movie had great potential but I found it to be slow moving at times and many of the scenes were very dark. Theseus finds the mythical Epirus bow that is a magical weapon of great power and one that can kill from great distances. Unfortunately he loses it twice and seems to have slippery fingers. Faced against an army of hundreds of thousands he manages to kill four warriors with the bow!<br /><br />I didn't enjoy the liberties taken with real Greek mythology and there should have been enough in the ancient tales to have made a great movie without muddying the water with so many twists in the script. The titans were depicted as man size beings that the gods ripped apart easily and the titans only did well because of superior numbers in the fight. The titans were ancient and powerful giants and the story of the movie had nothing in common with the ancient history beliefs.<br /><br />With all the high tech imagery, high powered action and actors this movie could have been a lot more. It came out OK but not outstanding and I expected more. The haphazard storyline was intermingled with some good fight scenes but overall the movie just didn't grab me like the movie 300 did.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|when I was playing this app. I loved the movie but I can't go back to the home screen. I hope gameloft put a homebar on it next time
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I've read all the books in the series and loved them. But I was dubious about the HBO version - how could it possibly live up to the quality of the books? Well, based on the first season, I'm happy to say that, if anything, the HBO series is even better than the books. The story, the acting, the settings, the music, everything is outstanding. I usually get videos on Netflix but, with Game of Thrones, buying the whole season is a must. Once you start watching it you don't want to stop.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app at first I couldn't get out of it and the tool bar was gone but all you have to do is click the button in the bottom right corner click options and it will pop up
B003L77G38|5.0|i was looking for a show to watch after CHUCK was stupidly cancelled and came upon this show. saw one episode of season 3 and was hooked. i went back and watched from the beginning and was amazed at how it was not just a show about science but also had a heart and focused on relationships and how we affect each other just by being around. recommend fringe very highly.  if you bemoan the lack of quality tv, i can tell you that fringe will renew your faith that quality is out there. you won't be sorry if you try fringe.

0380799006|5.0|I found this book very helpful. It is easy to read, and uses scenarios to demonstrate the various techniques. I have a three year old that acts out of jealousy toward our one year old, and have been struggling trying to get her to stop hurting him. The book instructs parents to first acknowledge the feelings of the child acting out, no matter how mean they may be. Once I started this, I noticed instant results. There was an immediate reduction in the frequency of her acting out. It really opens a parents eyes to both the lives of our children, and even some scenarios that we may have experienced as children.
B004LROMQG|4.0|this was a gift for my granddaughter. we loved to watch it together, when she came to visit.

B004ZJZQH4|5.0|This is an amazing video. What a story about how working together, brains, courage and shear guts can make suchb a differece. No gun, no bad guys - pure intellect saves the day.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The Hunger Games triology represents a politcal statement in line with the tea party themes of the degradation of individual rights due to the power of a central \\"Capital\\" or government.  The struggle of individuals, the thoughts of near slave labor, the juxtaposition of the the power of those in the Capital as compared to those in the secitns are all relevent.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I decided to download this because it was the free app of the day and I'm not disappointed. its an amazingly fun app and it seems with every new layout you make, its a whole new song.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|A great band from my hometown. I am so proud that this band has put our beautiful & historic town of Athens Alabama back on the map. As far as the music this is some of the most eclectic music i think i have ever heard. It's Rock, Soul,funk,blues with a little southern edge. The music is great on here but what really draws you in is her voice. She can sing so smooth & sexy like otis redding with a touch of bobby blue bland & then kick it into Janis joplin. This is a very good first album. The music stands on it's own & is very new & fresh just what the doctor ordered. I expect the next album will be even better due to being able to record in better a studio.
0345803485|1.0|I have 2 major concerns/gripes. #1, With this book being somehow connected to Twilight (still having a hard time making that connection myself), I feel like it's probably being targeted at tweens/teens who loved Twilight. I'm sorry, but that's highly inappropriate. I realize that parents could step in & stop a tween/teen from reading it, but come on, let's be real - is that going to happen? One teen will read it & then the rest will follow suit because that's just how it goes these days, parents opinions or rules don't really seem to matter. Gripe #2, the writing was absolutely horrid. Boring characters, long drawn-out scenarios that lead nowhere, nothing moving or even remotely interesting. I read about halfway through & decided to return it for a refund on my Kindle (fyi, you can get a refund within the first 7 days, for which I was very grateful). All in all it left me really irritated & wondering how such a crappy book could get so much praise & recognition.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|really great game. love the ice age theme. scratch is awesome. engages your thoughts.hard to tear yourself away. worth it to play it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such an equal balance of fear, fun, love and desperation. Easy read but altogether intriguing. Must read the whole series!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is one of the few games that I cant wait to get back to. I love the concept and love to figure them out. I definately recommend this game especially if you love puzzles.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Seldom have I purchased a cd and loved every song.  This one is of those cds.  I am very happy I bought it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my children and I love this game. it is easy and fun. I was able to find the exit game function. I'm looking forward to playing more games like this one. thank you Gameloft!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The kindle version is a little weird, probably because I am new to using the Kindle. But the story is extremely good, and I would recommend this book to everyone. Read the Hunger Games first though :) Can't wait for the movie to come out, Catching Fire!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A powerful movie with an important message. This movie gives us rules for life and will improve the faith of the next generation. It has a wholesome message good for any audience. A movie that tells it straight: we need to take responsibility for our families lives and salvation.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this is a fun game for anyone who enjoys building a small business. I enjoy playing this game and reccomend for all ages
0312576463|5.0|I think this is a very good novel, although I can see how it would polarize the reading audience here, especially if you are a great fan of the Republican political party.<br />To me, it is also a great psychological study of the motives behind our so called free choices throughout life.<br />I'm sure many of the characters ways of thinking could hit pretty close to home of the characters that make up the cast in our own lives, not excluding our own thought processes, as well, if we remain honest with ourselves that is.<br />I enjoyed it, that's if you can say being left with a churned stomach on most occasions throughout the novel is enjoyable, but it is a mainly unhappy emotional roller-coaster ride that will have many readers looking to get off long before the ride is over.<br />Although, that's life and Jonathan has represented the pitfalls in the hunt for what we can sometimes mistakenly see as our true path to exercising our freedom at the expense of other living thing's lives.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game it reminds me so much of Mario brothers I can tell I'm going to play this game a whole lot,the levels are not repetitive and they are super fun!!!!
B0065QUD8W|5.0|There are several reasons why I appreciate this book.  #1 is that I can access all of Conan Doyle's books/stories about Sherlock without having to carry around a huge, heavy book.<br />#2 is that we are taking a Communiversity class on Sherlock Holmes this Spring, and it has been very easy for me to \\"read up\\" on Sherlock before attending our 3 weekly classes.  Probably the only thing missing would be some of the original illustrations.  That is not an issue for me, however.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|If you want to go back your home screen all you have to do is click on the &quot;stuff&quot; icon in the game....then go to options and the arrow to go back to your home screen will show up at the bottom. It's simple. Especially if you look at the other reviews since someone already told everybody how to do it. I think this game is very fun! Even on my kindle fire. :-)
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Will Robie has killed a lot of people. It is what he does best. He is a hired assassin, one who works for the US government. Even though his targets are supposedly very bad people, he seems an unlikely choice for a hero. His latest assignment, however, is a US government employee in Washington DC. When he breaks into her apartment and finds her asleep, her two children nearby, he finds a conscience and decides not to carry out his assignment.<br /><br />In this line of business there are penalties for failure, and he immediately finds himself dodging bullets from his former employers, on the run and running out of options. He nevertheless detours to rescue a 14 year old girl who seems to be targeted by killers too. They form an unlikely (granted, the whole thing is unlikely, but one expects that in this type of novel) alliance, one that provides entertainment and an emotional foundation to the story. There are several climaxes, as different story lines resolve, and one of them was too obvious to be satisfying, but the whole novel was still quite good.<br /><br />The action is fast and non-stop, the dialogue crisp and realistic, the characters thinly drawn but likeable. This is a superior action and mystery novel, by one of today's best action novelists. Baldacci gives his fans what they want here, with plenty of cliffhanger moments, with a plot that twists and turns, surprising the reader in almost every chapter. This is one of the author's better efforts, superior to Hell's Corner (my last review of his writing). I recommend this enthusiastically to Baldacci fans, and those who might just become fans.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is fun until you run out of energy. when this happens you have to wait an hour for it to recharge or buy it.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Second time buying this, as the first time I made the mistake of lending it out.  Even though Dr. Horrible is available on Netflix, we had to have the DVD again.  The musical commentary is AWESOME and some of the fan applications to the ELE are hilarious.  In short, the special features make it worth owning, even a second time around.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I was hoping for an adventure story, something along the lines of The Talisman, when I bought this book and decided to give it a go.  Unfortunately, I soon discovered that it was more along the lines of Bag of Bones.  It started strong, though, and I was initially hooked.  But, before long, it started to get boring and romantic.  I don't understand why Stephen King is starting to write romance novels- this isn't his first, as I mentioned, Bag of Bones- maybe he has alot of female fans now, and he doesn't want to disappoint them.  Maybe he's listening to recommendations from his wife too much.  I don't know, but I long for the days of Dead Zone, Tommyknockers, The Talisman, The Stand, Pet Semetary and Christine.  Actually, now that I think about it, Christine was a bit of a romance story too. But, in general, those stories were masculine, with high adventure and thought-provoking themes, and little time for sappy romantic diversions and distractions.<br /><br />However, as is the case with most stories, there was a payoff eventually.  Because I was aware of this phenomenon, and because there were a few other things going on that were interesting, and also because I am an accomplished academic and minored in History when I was in college, I kept going, I muddled through, and was rewarded with alot of fun at the end.  However, my recommendation to you, especially if you're short on time, is just to read the book until you start getting bored(unless you're one of those female fans that like romance novels, you know who you are), and then skip to the section titled, \\"The Green Card Man\\".  You won't be missing much, and you'll be getting the most important stuff.<br /><br />That being said, I had some problems even with the stuff that mattered.  This was definitely his most \\"preachy\\" book.  There were some definite opinions and messages here, which is fine, as long as the story is interesting and the preaching is not overbearing.  And that is what saved this story- barely.<br /><br />Indeed, it has been done many times in the past.  Some obvious examples are War of the Worlds and 1984.  You think those guys weren't preaching?  They surely were.  Even the very popular story of Frankenstein could be said to be preaching, giving the opinion that if you mess with nature enough, it will come back to haunt you.<br /><br />In any case, I disagreed with several of the opinions espoused in this book.  I don't think that if JFK hadn't been assassinated, then the world would have gone to hell.  And I don't think that if you traveled through time, then the universe would explode, eventually.  Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity left the door wide open for time travel- without consequence.  Indeed, the main stumbling-blocks have always been just two things- The Grandfather Paradox and The Butterfly Effect.  However, these things have been largely dismissed in recent years- thanks to the advent of the discoveries of parallel universes and multi-dimensional space-time.<br /><br />If you went back in time and killed your grandfather, you could still exist to do it over and over again.  You would just be doing it in, and existing in, parallel universes.  Same goes for The Butterfly Effect.  Changing things would not cause anything to explode, things would just exist in parallel universes.  No fuss.  No muss.<br /><br />In any case, it also follows that I disagree with the notion that the past is obdurate.  The past may or may not be obdurate, but THE PRESENT SURELY IS!  I think he should have done more in this book to relay that message, as he has done in previous works.  But maybe Stephen King has so much money now, that he has forgotten this.<br /><br />One last thing about this story, which is something that often occurs in his stories, and which is something that I love, is the task of making ordinary people look extraordinary, and just as important as \\"Bigshots\\" like JFK.  This was done most obviously with Sadie.  I absolutely loved the part where Deke said that it, \\"wasn't a fair trade.\\"  That was excellent.  Just excellent.<br /><br />In any case, I'm looking forward to reading some more Dean Koontz, Clive Barker, Grisham, Stephen Frey, or maybe even Clancy, some very masculine writers, indeed.t where Deke said that it, \\"wasn't a fair trade.\\"  That was excellent.  Just excellent.<br /><br />In any case, I'm looking forward to reading some more Dean Koontz, Clive Barker, Grisham, Stephen Frey, or maybe even Clancy, some very masculine writers, indeed.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|We (a Canadian and an American) were watching via Netflix DVDs and just couldn't wait any longer, so bought the series.<br /><br />This is one of the best TV shows we've ever seen.  We've been through the entire series several times.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|I've seen this movie a bunch of times... One of my very favorites and I highly recommend it.  Matt Damon is great!
B0055SWM08|5.0|The game is a relatively simple but nicely challenging series of puzzles.  What makes it special is how well it is done, with great attention to detail.  And the fact that the themes of the game make it calming, which is the opposite of most games.  My 4 year old even likes it, though he sometimes needs extra hints to solve puzzles.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|E.L.James, or as known in the fandom universe as SQIceDragon, took her fanfiction, copied and pasted it and then clicked find/replace for the names of the characters. This book is not original, besides the BDSM plot. She used another author's work to create her \\"own\\". This story is Fanfiction. Not literature. How do I know that this is a copy and paste work? One, I have the original document of the fanfiction and I can literally sit this book and the document side by side and read the same lines together. Two, same editing mistakes. James or \\"Icy\\" took her work and literally copied and pasted. She didn't do any editing to the original fiction.<br /><br />E. L. James should not be known as anything else besides a fanfiction author.
B0052WBIFC|5.0|This is a fantastic live album by a band that is really making waves.  Biffy Clyro's studio albums have been outstanding and just keep getting better if that's possible.  This live album just takes it to the next level!!!  The live versions of all the studio tracks have an extra dimension of energy and sheer power that propels this album to great heights.  These guys put in a fantastic show and the sound and music quality is awesome.  This package also comes with a DVD of the show!  What a deal!  Don't hold off on this album.  It is a gem!

B0061C1NQ6|5.0|Warning: SPOILERS!!!!<br /><br />My husband is a Russian immigrant-he grew up in Ekateringburg, a city in the Ural Mountains, and he was very impressed with how accurately everyday life in Russia is portrayed in this book. I asked him about the scene where Renko's friend is happy with his broken washing machine, and he said that was true to life-that a Russian in that time would be happy with any new appliance whether it worked or not, because it was so hard to actually get anything. I thought about my time in Russia, and walking for blocks to buy milk, and then more blocks to buy cereal, and the American cop's comment about how there was no fresh meat in the stores. It's true-there wasn't much fresh food. All the little details of Russian life rang true.<br /><br />Aside from my own personal experience, this was a fascinating mystery. It's not so much a who-done-it as a why-would-they-have-done-it. The story revolves around Russian sables-an animal so rare it's hard to find pictures on the Internet, that produces fur so valuable it's literally worth its weight in gold. In these days of political correctness, when fur is frowned upon, it's a truly unique look at a world where a coat can cost one hundred thousand dollars and a man will skin murder victims just to acquire a few animals. There's also some pretty ferocious commentary on how our government works, and it doesn't seem like there's much to choose between the United States and Soviet Russia when it comes to high finance. This is the book that introduced me to Arkady Renko and his love-hate relationship with Russia, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a different kind of detective story.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I'm going to take a break from reading George R.R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series for a while. But it's not because I'm growing weary of the series; it's because I find myself so engrossed in it that the characters and settings are finding their ways into my dreams. A Storm of Swords, the third book in the series, is also the third book I've read in a row. The series is that good and that engrossing. (And I promised myself I wouldn't gush about never having cared for fantasy novels before as I did in my previous two reviews.)<br /><br />A Storm of Swords carries on the intricately plotted story of Westeros (and beyond) with both familiar characters and new ones. If you thought Martin was unafraid to kill off main characters after the noble-to-a-fault Ned Stark met his fate on the executioner's block in the first book, just wait until you get to A Storm of Swords. No fewer than five major characters meet their ends in these pages, including a couple that will break your heart and at least one who's death you'll cheer. The lives of several other characters seem in jeopardy by the end of the book. (Nope, I'm not going to spoil it for you. Just read the book!)<br /><br />I don't know how Martin does it. He weaves together the lives of several dozen characters over the course of this series. Such a task would be daunting, by Martin makes it look easy as his narrative swoops around Westeros and across the Narrow Sea. He intertwines the fates of the various characters in unexpected ways that, even after reading a couple of thousand pages, can still surprise you. This is epic storytelling at its very finest.<br /><br />Please don't confuse me with a literary sycophant. Martin does have a few minor tics that get under my skin a bit in A Storm of Swords. For one, I appreciate his deft turns of phrase, but in some places they come across as a bit strained and too close to the modern idiom. In one place he has Robb Stark say, \\"I told you to hold Riverrun. What part of that command did you fail to comprehend?\\" It seems a bit \\"modern\\" in the world of Westeros. Then later on in the book another character uses the expression, \\"What part of 'yield' do you not comprehend?\\" Yeah, it's a minor thing, but it just felt out of place to me.<br /><br />My other quibble is the fate of Arya. The poor girl has been wandering around Westeros since the end of the first book, and despite a few near misses she still has yet to reconnect with anyone from her scattered family. I think even Martin realized this since at one point he writes, \\"Arya was tired of making for Riverrun. She had been making for Riverrun for years, it seemed, without ever getting there.\\" I heartily concur with that sentiment but I'm also guessing Martin has some major plot points ahead for Arya, so I'll be patient with the game of Where in Westeros is Arya Stark Today for a little longer.<br /><br />For those two quibbles I'd deduct maybe a half of a star. That slight deduction is offset by some of the new revelations A Storm of Swords contains. We're introduced in a big way to the Wildings (along with giants, mammoths and even, apparently, a close-up view of one of the Others). I'm particularly fascinated by The Wall and the Night's Watch, so I gobbled these sections up like a shadowcat chewing up a wilding. Then there are new settings such as the Pyke, Dorne, a glimpse of Littlefinger's ancestral home with its plentiful rocks and sheep ... ummm, \\"poop,\\" plus several exotic cities across the Narrow Sea.<br /><br />As fascinating as some of the new characters are (yep, I'm looking at you, Brienne), the changes taking place in some of the characters who have been around since the first book are just as fascinating. Jaime and Tyrion both seem to be going through some major self-reflection. Jon Snow is growing into a man at The Wall. Even Sansa, my least-favorite character, is blossoming amid the drama that surrounds her.<br /><br />Like I said at the start of this review, I'll betaking a brief sabbatical from Westeros. But after bringing all that I love about this series to mind as I write this review, I don't think my break will last very long.
B004SBX112|1.0|Before this latest up date it was a great game. Now every 5th level it wants another $00.99 to unlock them, though the pop-up CLEARLY states &amp;#34;A one time fee to unlock ALL levels&amp;#34; as it's been-but $00.99 for 5 levels ?! Are you *&yen;&iquest;#+=&euro; kidding me ? The update pop-up  displays every time I open it &amp; they want .99&cent; per 5 levels - they may have lost a customer &amp; fan with one blow !

0316098329|4.0|I read the 1 star reviews & while I see the points of some of them, I recommend listening to this book. The audio is in a child's voice, with adult voices for the adults. I have no children but really enjoyed this child. He is very precocious & has a grasp on so many things...yet he is like a newborn when let out of his \\"room\\". I found the book very interesing & do recommend it. This is the kind of read that ups our ability to be compassionate as well as empathetic which are great virtues.<br /><br />I recommend listening to ROOM.
0385342063|4.0|Love all her books! Not this one as much as others but still very enjoyable! I just wish she would put out more books more often as I cant wait until the next one!!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Ii was not aware that in the  State of Washington a person (Leila) can be committed to a locked private mental facility without the legal consent of a relative or a court order.  Apparently only one doctor and a  citizen with a grievance and a ton of money  is all that is required  for lockup and  &#34;treatment &#34;.  I won't go to Washington any time soon.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Good, fun but a little too insensitive.  I wish that the goals were a little easier to achieve add well
0345803485|1.0|Really....I mean Really?...<br />What a mish mash of Jane Eyre, Jane Austen, Rebbecca, Beauty and the Beast and Twilight.<br />I didn't find an original or even interesting aspect to this novel.<br />The dinner scene where Ana meets Christian's parents was stolen from Twilight. Yeah, it's hot, but so was Jacqueline Suzanne.<br />If you have read it...I'm sure you agree. If<br />you haven't don't bother. There are over 1600!!! holds on the book in my library system. Really, just goes to show what<br />good PR can do.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a love story of modern times. Its the 2012 romance novel. There's no other way to describe it.

B004HV54TU|3.0|I used the 3M Ergonomic mouse that looks like a joystick for about eight years.  [[ASIN:B00008KWWG 3M Ergonomic Mouse, Optical, USB/PS2 Compatible, Small Size, Black (EM500GPS)]]<br />I liked it except for what others complain about, using the thumb causes it some strain.  However, I took the little strain on my thumb as much better than the problems a real mouse causes me.<br />So my 3M mouse started giving me fits. I looked for the latest and greatest and settled on this mouse.  I've used it for nearly a month now and it's ok.  I like having a wheel again (the 3M mouse doesn't have this).<br />It's a bit big for my hand.  I am a woman and my right hand measures 3 inches from edge to edge across my knuckles.<br />The one thing you for sure do not want to do is using a get wrist support with this device.  It really made my wrist ache.<br />At this point, I don't think it's worth the extra $40 over the 3M mouse, but I'll stick with it.
B001LF347E|5.0|I LOVE this series! I honestly did not think that I was going to enjoy it at first, but as I kept watching I found myself getting more and more interested in the plot as well as more and more attached to the characters! The actor that plays Merlin is very lovable and entertaining! He does a great job! I would definitely recommend this series to people that enjoy good character, morals, and a little bit of magic! =]<br /><br />Cons: The special effects are a bit cheesy, but once you get passed that the show is still amazing!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I could almost hear Tina Fey's voice as I read it and it helped pass my wait time on a recent flight. It will not disappoint. Highly entertaining,you don't want it to be over at the end.

B0052GACNM|4.0|I loved this CD, I only wish some of the songs were longer. I could listen to this all day, (and sometimes do) Mixing the old with the new was wonderful. The Lady is a Tramp with Lady Gaga was my favorite - she really has a great voice -wish she would get rid of the weirdness - she doesn't need it.  Fantastic CD.

B0064JV4LU|5.0|Philippe is handsome and rich, with a palatial apartment (complete with team of domestics) in the heart of Paris.  Philippe's only \\"hassle,\\" as Driss puts it:  He is paralyzed from the neck down.  A young black man fresh from prison, Driss is eager for a signature from Philippe attesting that he interviewed for a caregiver position but too bad, so sad was not qualified.  This signature is all Driss needs to qualify for France's cushy unemployment benefits.  Unfortunately for Driss, Philippe decides to hire him instead.<br /><br />Why Philippe would place his life in the hands of the brash, rather unsympathetic Driss is a mystery at first.  Yet as the movie unfolds, you experience firsthand the tension between how Philippe sees himself (useless, embarrassing, ashamed), how past caregivers have treated him (as a fragile doll they are terrified of breaking), and how Driss sees him:  Driss is the only one to accept Philippe as a real human being with a future, with dreams and possibilities of his own.<br /><br />A beautiful film, based on a true story.  Wish they made more like these in America!  The opera scene was absolutely hilarious.

0439023513|3.0|well i have read a lot of bad reviews, and i'm glad i didn't read the ones with spoiler alerts first...so i'll just say this...I loved hunger games.  I was boohoo-ing at the last 5 pages of Catching Fire, sitting on the couch crying to my dogs, \\"This is the best book ever!\\", and after Mockingjay, it does have a...oh how can i put it... satisfying... ending.  I'm sure people will disagree about that but I will agree with the other reviewers about some things, in certain areas you go back and re-read sections over again, I totally lost characters and their correlating names (who? huh?), and at one point I even looked up from my book into space and said out loud, \\"WHAT?\\" It is more stressful and you keep thinking, if I was Katniss I would have gone insane, or sank into a deep depression never to come out, or ran away because of all the stresses of war...ON A TEENAGE GIRL.  But its not about me, its about a fictitious character named Katniss, this is her story of what happened to her.  And you have to remember from the beginning of hunger games, she took on the role as the parent, the adult, the bread winner, and hunter of the family.  She has acted as an adult since she was 11.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this book had to be so stressful, I probably feel this way because I got so sucked into the love bubble from hunger games, that I forgot what it was all about from the beginning, a sadistic dictator ruling a poor and decrepit nation of innocent people...bonk! bonk! these are their stories.  And so the love bubble is definitely fragile, but it is indeed a bubble because you forget all the horrible things going until the end of hunger games, back to reality, bubble popped.  Just realize the love bubble doesn't recreate itself, no first kiss again, no more innocent children, they are acting adults.  And this book is so stressful because it is a tale of war and the people affected by the war.  The first two books are just leading up to it.<br /><br />I am just satisfied with the end, but the book as a whole was not my favorite of the three.....<br /><br />I have to add, which is why I even read the second and third is because the first was so good i wanted to know what happened next...and it was not as good, but again i'm ok with it. I gave 3 out of 5 stars because I wouldn't discourage people from just not finishing the series.
B00003CXB2|5.0|My favorite movie of all time. Exciting,  Thrilling, The Best Cinematography. A movie that could never be duplicated today. And Peter O'Toole was just outstanding.<br />\
B0061S0A64|5.0|almost zen way to creatively express yourself.  offers a large range of sounds and options. I found the experience very pleasant. Its fun either by yourself or with friends on a collaborated piece.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed every page.  This book was inventive, the characters are interesting. Katniss is a true hero as are many others.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good stuff so far.  hoping I wont be forced to spend real dollars soon. more words to fill space here.
B0037UUZQY|1.0|The legs on this doll come off with little effort. I have bought and returned 3 of these for my 5 year old. One was broken in the the box. My 2 year old is on her second doll. I mean 5 dolls in 2 days have had the legs fall off! And they were not playing rough. Poor quality. Disappointed
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I guess I'm too old for this kind of book. It was a good read, but the subject matter bothered me a lot. It reminded me of the short story, \\"The Lottery\\" by Shirley Jackson which I read in high school.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Keeps &quot;looking for updates &quot;,  then says there's no Internet connection - but there is.  Only option is quit or retry - can't get to the game.
0345803485|2.0|I cannot believe I've heard this book talked about on the Today Show 3 times. I figured it had to be worth all the talk, but I felt very led astray. I read all three books waiting for the big twist that was making it so news worthy. Talk about a let down. The book is completely predictable and the author continually uses the same phrases to describe the couples sex.... which is pretty much every other page. I love a good romance read, but I found myself hoping they would just stop having sex, that should never happen.<br />Don't bother with this book, read any other romance novel and you'll be better off.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are amazing! I will read them over and over. I am so glad I purchased them rather than borrow them like I was going to.. Can not wait to watch the movie now. What a fantastic way to suck me in to these books!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this app because some of the mini games are challenging and some are easy. its easy and a lot of fun to use.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|First of all, this set includes all four (thus far) Alien films: \\"Alien\\", \\"Aliens\\", \\"Alien3\\", and \\"Alien: Resurrection\\".  This set also includes a huge amount of special features; special features such as \\"The Making of...\\", photo galleries, and behind-the-scenes tight of (for lack of a better word) stuff.  The extras come in two Blu-Ray discs (unlike other collections where the movies come in Blu-Ray discs and extras in DVDs).<br />Each movie disc comes with both the Director's Cut version of the film and the Theatrical version.  They also include commentaries in each.  All of the other extras, as I said above, come in two separate Blu-Ray discs.<br />This collection brings all the extras and special features from the past collectors editions of the films and puts them all together into one collection.  It also has its own exclusive extras not seen in past editions.  The reason why I buy films in collection, besides the awesome packaging, is because of the special features, so if anyone else loves special features then this is a perfect collection to have.  If you doubt the amount of features it has, just look at the \\"Special Features\\" section of the film's page.<br /><br />I bought this collection for about $43, so at that price it was a steal.  Each film alone costs $15 and would have cost me $60 (plus tax) for all.  Also, each seperate film lacks any features beyond those which the movie discs in this collection have.  So for about $20 dollars less I got all four films, plus two more discs filled with extras (that the separate versions lack), and I got it all in a elegant and convenient package.  I couldn't possibly go wrong with choosing this.<br /><br />... or could I?<br /><br />No.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i know everyone said you have to shut down yoir kindle to leave the app... but you dont! all you have to do is: 1, tap &quot;stuff&quot; 2, tap options 3, the home menue icon will show. thank you for reading this review. :)
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I don't know what happened but I just went back to the game and everything I had done in my last session was undone.  its a pain to go back and redo this stuff! its even telling me that it takes an hour to harvest the chickens! what's going on?  ill redonthis and give you a better rating when you fix this annoying glitch .... untill then you wont be getting anymore money out of me. thanks.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo Mail works flawlessly on my midrange Android.  It's quick, loaded with features, and has never given me a single issue.  Excellent.

B001AQR3JY|5.0|My son had a copy of this and when he moved away, he took it with him.  I bought one to keep and watch with my grandchildren.  Love this movie!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this three book series.  I couldn't stop reading to see the characters overcome their problems and develop in their relationship.  Although some of the writing is a bit annoying, the story pulls you in.  Such a fun, emotional read!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|On a 5 hour drive,  and I played it the whole time... great game! I showed it to all of my friends and now they have the same game too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This third book is a very satisfying conclusion to Ana and Christians story.  The best part of this book series is how the characters grow and adjust to be together and support each other.  Very romantic story and great epilogue.
0399159029|5.0|This is the 8th Bernie Gunther \\"historical adventure\\" - the series runs from the 1930's through the 50's. Bernie is a Berlin detective - whether in police uniform or not - and has been described elsewhere as the \\"only honest cop in Nazi Germany\\". Regardless of \\"when\\" each of the books occurs - before, during or after WWII - Bernie - whether while inside or outside of the regime - is fighting his own one man war against the Nazis. There's more than a little Philip Marlowe/Sam Spade to Gunther - jaded, cynical, personal moral code - and the author does an excellent job blending historical facts and personages into his mysteries.<br /><br />Prague Fatale opens in 1941 with Bernie in a Police uniform, (Kripo), and in war-time Berlin. He's just returned from the eastern front and is having more than a little trouble \\"reacclimating\\" to \\"regular life\\". He's also one Reinhard Heydrich - yes that Reinhard Heydrich - phone-call/telegram away from being called back into \\"active service\\". And when that call comes, Bernie packs his bag and takes his new girlfriend to Prague, Czechoslovakia, where Heydrich has just been appointed Deputy Reich Protector, (Reichsprotektor), by Hitler. Heydrich is holding a big soirée - complete with Nazi big wigs - to celebrate his new appointment and needs some help with security, specifically his own personal security.<br /><br />Once in Prague, Bernie realizes there's more to his trip than meets the eye, starting with the murder of one of Heydrich's aides, and Bernie now is tasked with solving the case while watching his back. Bernie and the author are now in their element. Kerr's portrayal of the individual Nazis involved, starting with Heydrich, are frighteningly real; including the dialogue, actions, machinations and scheming. The \\"mystery\\" itself is a classic \\"locked door\\" murder - right out of a Hercule Poirot/Agatha Christie novel - and which is duly noted by Heydrich. And the conclusion is ambivalent and tragic enough to be realistic without disappointing the reader.<br /><br />This is an excellent addition to an excellent series - and some fans may be especially pleased to see this narrative and Bernie \\"back\\" in the war years. Although it is not necessary to read the Gunther books in order to enjoy Prague Fatale - the chronology jumps around much like the John Lawton/Inspector Troy books - I would strongly suggest reading the first three books, collected under one cover Berlin Noir - which hooked this reader - before enjoying the rest of the series
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the romance in this book.  At times the wording is repetitive, but the story is so great it doesn't matter.  The book is part of a three book series, and plan on reading them all to see the development of the characters.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I am not a fan of tatoos so I was skeptical of this movie per the title...WOW am I glad I took a chance on this movie. Best movie I have seen in months...great story, directing, acting, cinematography. Nothing left behind in this film...don't miss it. FYI, definitely not a movie to watch with your family though...violence is high and the sex scenes are intense and graphic...not an under 18 movie in my opinion.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is cool. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Mario brother style games.<br />Very cool game.
0802473156|5.0|Great book. Very simple theories that can make a world of difference in not just your marriage, but all your relationships.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its almost just like mario brothers almost identical. its fun and still easy enough for kids. great idea for a game an wat makes it even better is its free
B00009R86L|5.0|I bought this shoulder pad to replace the flimsy piece of crap that came with my camera bag. Even carrying a couple of lenses can get heavy and my old pad cut into my neck and shoulder. The Domke product is a thick pad and I barely notice the weight of my bag anymore, making long walks much more comfortable! It's also non-slip so my bag stays in place on my shoulder. This is an awesome pad for ANY bag!! Highly recommend!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is the best I have read in a long while. I enjoyed this whole trilogy immensely. Once I started with it, I couldn't put it down. It only took me about 10 days to read the whole thing.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The first book of this trilogy was amazing, I couldn't put it down but the second part was kind of long and no in a good way. Took me a while to read it. But you have to if you want to know what happens.
0743270754|5.0|A book of 750 pages of history has never been so informative; I found it difficult to put down. I have read many books on Civil War and Abe Lincolns' life, but Ms. Kearns weaves together the lives of Chase, Seward, Stanton and Bates with Lincoln's. All five men were competitors and all contributed greatly to the Unions' success. I knew how this story ends, but it doesn't matter. Ms. Goodwin makes the journey so completely interesting, every single page important. I can't improve on previous reviews, but I have to comment on such an interesting book.<br /><br />The story of Lincoln's life (and his cabinet members' lives) and the way he brought all of his political rivals into his cabinet reads like a novel. No other president has had the nerve to bring his rivals (enemies) that close, just to hear opposing views. Clinton and Bush both could have benefited from opposing views (they probably wouldn't have listened anyway), just to mention a couple (also Nixon, Carter, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Wilson, etc.). Of course, 1860 was the most difficult time in the country's history, and no two politicians in Washington DC had the same opinion.<br /><br />If Lincoln hadn't been assassinated, he probably would have had a completely different legacy. The politicians probably would have tried to impeach him like they did with Andrew Johnson.<br /><br />I only have one criticism of the book - the title. Such an amazing, incredible story from ten years of research needs a title that gets your attention. Something like \\"Lincoln: Destroyer and Preserver of The United States\\", or \\"Lincoln: Genius Takes Scruples To Washington - Miracles ARE Possible\\", or \\"President Lincoln's Civil War Cabinet: Diversity Of Opinions On Steroids\\" (maybe that's too much).
1452101248|5.0|This is by far the best cookbook I have ever used. Every recipe is unique, memorable, and healthy. Looking forward to the next meal.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I read this in preparation of attending the musical  \\"Les Miz\\".  In reality, I skip read a lot of it for Hugo is terribly, terribly wordy.  My 21st century mind found it very slow going.  I  am grateful that this book was never a school assignment.  If it had been, I might never have read anything again!
B001OFJPIS|3.0|The visuals in this film are fantastic, but I'd expect no less from Guillermo del Toro.  The problem is that the plot is almost hopelessly predictable.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|cool game just like Mario bros but u cant upgrade. make sure u hit the snails twice to destroy them.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|The E17 is a great step up from previous Fiio products and delivers unbelievable sound for such a small, portable package at an affordable price.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a very addicting and fun game. my 6 year old and 10 year old daughters can not seem to stop playing it.
0345529057|5.0|Solid speed, got here within 3 days of order. For the buck it is honestly one of the best deals I've gotten with paperbacks. All 3200+ pages are worth it! Great story line. If you're a fan and want to get ahead of the HBO series because you just can't wait, this is the buy for you. 9/10 would bang.
B000NQPZCO|4.0|I like this film. Al Pacino plays his role just right. This is also the Extended cut, which was the first time i saw it. I like the newly added scenes. I think it improved the film and made it more complete. I also like Michael Madsen in the film and his character. 1 of my favourite scenes is when they beat the Japanese guy.<br /><br />Picture quality: 4.5/5<br /><br />I think it looks pretty sharp and detailed with all the film grain intact, as it should be. Colours look nice and such. Nothing to complains about. I think it has more or less reference quality.<br /><br />Audio quality: 4.5/5<br /><br />I compared the LPCM 5.1 and the noticable poorer Dolby Digital 5.1 against each other. Everything sounds better in the LPCM 5.1 mix. I think it was very clear and pretty good quality.<br /><br />Film: 4.5/5<br />Overall: 4/5
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The Lightweight Microshell Folio cover gives my Kindle Fire the added protection that it needs, with added functionality. The kickstand is basic but perfect for creating a nice angle for viewing videos. The elastic loop is a very nice feature for a little extra support around the hand when you're holding the Fire in either the left or right hand, and serves nicely to hold the easy-fold cover to the back of the Fire when open.<br /><br />The Fire definitely needs a bit of protection and this was the perfect, light-weight addition that gives me more piece of mind to carry my Kindle around, without the huge girth or weight of other bulky protects. Keeps everything simple and efficient. Definitely recommend.
B004CSKCS6|3.0|This isn`t the best Japanese film i have see. I think the lead actor is good. He is also in the Death Note films. I like some of the music in the film, like for example the Bach song.<br /><br />Picture quality: 3/5<br /><br />This has a lot of DNR. I don`t think there was much grain left after the overuse of DNR. Still, it looks better than the DVD releases. Some stronger colours and what is left of the details and sharpness.<br /><br />Audio quality: 4/5<br /><br />The audio track in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 was pretty strong in my opinion. Good bass and clarity. I don`t remember anything wrong with it.<br /><br />Film: 3.5/5<br />Overall: 3/5
0553593544|5.0|I did see the films before reading the series, and personally I like The Bourne Identity novel more so than the first film.  Though, after book one, I did enjoy the next two movies more so than the source material.  Yeah, it was a risk / departure with the shaking cam effect. But, the fist book is a must read for any fan of the series.
B001UL7SLW|3.0|I think this was worst of the first 3 films. It has less action scenes than Terminator and Terminator 2 and less violent. hence the 12 rating, not a good sign. I think this film was too much like the previous film and didn`t come up with anything new.<br /><br />Picture quality: 4/5<br /><br />I think it looks good and has the grain intact. Colours and details looks good, but this isn`t the film with best picture quality i have seen. Some of the CGI and CGI stunt doubles looks a bit unconvincing due to CGI looking a bit dated now, but what can you do?.<br /><br />Audio quality: 4/5<br /><br />The English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1 was good and not much to say about it.<br /><br />Film: 3/5<br />Overall: 3.5/5
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|This is not about any recent or similar works.  This movie has no Dub, just subtitles.  The film sets itself up very well and plunges you into the chaos of a real Battle Royal.  I can't accurately judge the actors' performance as an american, but for me they did a wonderful job.  The contrast between the two groups (Total chaos vs Classical music) makes this a one of my favorite movies.  Yes, the plot isn't 100% original, but that can be said for every story.  It's how the artist creates their own 'twist' on a work of fiction.  The Hunger Games is not a ripoff, but doesn't stand out as something unique - appealing to most everyone.<br />BR is violent, brutally violent.  Yet, has a story arc.  HG action doesn't make it weak in comparison.  Parts of the book are great, but the ending was lackluster (As if in Star Wars, after Luke destroyed the Death Star, he went back to work at the moisture farm.)
B0057O6IDW|4.0|I like this film. I like the cool and dead looking creature, Dr. Freudstein. I also enjoy the dark synth and atmospheric<br />music of Walter Rizzati. Some people may think or thought it was the music of frequent Fulci collaborator,Fabio Frizzi,but<br />it is not.Their music actually sound quite similar in this film, so some may mistake it for Frizzi music.<br /><br />Picture quality: 4/5<br /><br />The picture quality was greatly improved from my Anchor Bay DVD. There is problems with DNR and noise like Zombi 2,<br />but not as much problems like Zombi 2. I think Zombi 2 has poorer and more use of DNR than The House by the<br />Cemetery.<br /><br />The film grain is actually mostly noise mixed with grain. The DNR is noticable, but i have seen worse use of it as i said.<br />The things that are improved compared to the DVD is: black levels, blood & gore effects, colours, details and<br />sharpness.<br /><br />Audio quality: 3.5/5<br /><br />The English dub in the DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 Dolby Surround remix, is actually a bit disappointing to me. I thought<br />the mix would sound a bit clearer music wise and with more bass. Yes, there is some Stereo effects and such. At least it<br />sounds improved compared to the lossy Dolby Surround 2.0 mix on the DVD.<br /><br />Film: 4/5<br />Overall: 4/5
B002BWP49C|5.0|This DVD was received in a timely manner as described and is a great addition to my already Twilight collection. In perfect working order! Thanks for the Great Service!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Although my Thrive tab isn't listed as incompatible it does not render in HD and looks almost fuzzy. The levels play decently but there are moments where I can see what people mean by a bad port. Its as if they just rushed it out to cash in on the PvZ craze. Worked on me. I'm not going to ask for my money back because I read the devs notes but I was still hoping for quality from this especially since I'm running a great tab system. HD graphics would get one more star.  A better port would earn yet another. So for now 3 stars. Update for tablets already ! As fans we deserve better.
0807014273|5.0|Written during Nazi era, by a holocaust survivor, this book analyse man's existential contemplation and its impact on his psyche & actions. Author Viktor E. Frankl is a pioneer for his groundbreaking Logotherapy. Most of this book was written in Auschwitz concentration camp.<br />Part 1 of the book summarizes author's experience in concentration camp and his observation of human nature. One of my favorite quotes from this part is \\"there are only two races of men, decent men and indecent and no society is free of either of them.<br />Part 2 of the book explains Logotherapy & related concepts. One of his favorite metaphors is the existential vacuum.  If meaning is what we desire, then meaninglessness is a hole, an emptiness, in our lives. Whenever you have a vacuum, of course, things rush in to fill it.  Frankl suggests that one of the most conspicuous signs of existential vacuum in our society is boredom.  He points out how often people, when they finally have the time to do what they want, don't seem to want to do anything!  People go into a tailspin when they retire; students get drunk every weekend; we submerge ourselves in passive entertainment every evening.  The \\"Sunday neurosis,\\" he calls it.<br />So we attempt to fill our existential vacuums with \\"stuff\\" that, because it provides some satisfaction (i.e. happiness), we hope will provide ultimate satisfaction as well:  We might try to fill our lives with pleasure, eating beyond all necessity, having promiscuous sex, living \\"the high life;\\" or we might seek power, especially the power represented by monetary success; or we might fill our lives with \\"busy-ness,\\" conformity, conventionality; or we might fill the vacuum with anger and hatred and spend our days attempting to destroy what we think is hurting us.  We might also fill our lives with certain neurotic \\"vicious cycles,\\" such as obsession with germs and cleanliness, or fear-driven obsession with a phobic object.  The defining quality of these vicious cycles is that, whatever we do, it is never enough.<br />On the subject of happiness, Frankl quotes Edith Weisskopf-Joelson's paper on logotherapy, which shows great insight into the soul of the 21st century: \\"Our current mental hygiene philosophy stresses the idea that people ought to be happy, that unhappiness is a symptom of maladjustment. Such a value system might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavoidable unhappiness is increased by unhappiness about being unhappy.\\" He contends that \\"Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue\\". What an eye-opener...I read this part of the book every day, till the time I was reading the book.<br />Finding Meaning:<br />So how do we find meaning?  Frankl suggests three broad approaches.  The first is through experiential values, that is, by experiencing something - or someone - we value.  This can include Maslow's peak experiences and esthetic experiences such as viewing great art or natural wonders. The most important example of experiential values is the love we feel towards another.  Through our love, we can enable our beloved to develop meaning, and by doing so, we develop meaning ourselves!  Love, he says, \\"is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire\\".<br />Frankl points out that, in modern society, many confuse sex with love.  Without love, he says, sex is nothing more than masturbation, and the other is nothing more than a tool to be used, a means to an end.  Sex can only be fully enjoyed as the physical expression of love. Love is the recognition of the uniqueness of the other as an individual, with an intuitive understanding  of their full potential as human beings.  Frankl believes this is only possible within monogamous relationships.  As long as partners are interchangeable, they remain objects.<br />A second means of discovering meaning is through creative values, by \\"doing a deed,\\" as he puts it.  This is the traditional existential idea of providing oneself with meaning by becoming involved in one's projects, or, better, in the project of one's own life.  It includes the creativity involved in art, music, writing, invention, and so on. Frankl views creativity (as well as love) as a function of the spiritual unconscious, that is, the conscience.  The irrationality of artistic production is the same as the intuition that allows us to recognize the good.<br />The third means of finding meaning is one few people besides Frankl talk about: attitudinal values.  Attitudinal values include such virtues as compassion, bravery, a good sense of humor, and so on.  But Frankl's most famous example is achieving meaning by way of suffering.<br />He gives an example concerning one of his clients:  A doctor whose wife had died mourned her terribly.  Frankl asked him, \\"if you had died first, what would it have been like for her?\\"  The doctor answered that it would have been incredibly difficult for her.  Frankl then pointed out that, by her dying first, she had been spared that suffering, but that now he had to pay the price by surviving and mourning her.  In other words, grief is the price we pay for love.  For the doctor, this thought gave his wife's death and his own pain meaning, which in turn allowed him to deal with it.  His suffering becomes something more: With meaning, suffering can be endured with dignity.<br />Frankl also notes that seriously ill people are not often given an opportunity to suffer bravely, and thereby retain some dignity.  Cheer up! we say.  Be optimistic!  Often, they are made to feel ashamed of their pain and unhappiness.<br />He says this:  \\"everything can be taken from a man but one thing:  the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"<br />Conclusion:<br />Irrespective of your religious or spiritual inclination, this book is something you cannot ignore. Every reading session will introduce you to a new aspect of human psyche and will set you in soul-searching mode. A highly recommended book for those who want to go beyond the clutter of everyday life and find deeper meaning.ed in one's projects, or, better, in the project of one's own life.

B00169N0BK|5.0|This does a grat job. It is very easy to use and takes you step by step through what you need  to do. It displays on the screen what you need to do, plus there is video to demonstrating what to do. While you are calibrating you screen, it gives you an option to watch the vidos if you do not understand what to do. I like the fact that it gives me the chance to see the before and after, when it is done so I can see the difference.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book may start off just like any other romance novel but there are some unexpected twists and pretty hot love scenes. Adult rated Mills & Boon!
0446572993|4.0|Will Robie has a unique position; he is an America \\"sanctioned\\" assassin who takes on those who the Feds (civilian and military) for whatever reason cannot eliminate.  A sniper of immense talent, Will always accepts the job without question even understanding his agency's mantra is the opposite of the marines with \\"left behind\\".<br /><br />His work is normally outside the country in places like Tangier, but his current assignment is in Washington, D.C.  The hit feels wrong to Will, but obeying orders is deeply entrenched in his soul.  Perhaps it is his attraction to Annie Lambert, but for the first time in his killing career, he refuses to pull the trigger on the target a mom with her little boy.  The fail safe sniper kills both of them while Will snaps photos of the victim's information and moves her baby to another apartment before fleeing.  However, by failing to do the job, the forty year old hit man becomes the target of his peers.  On the lam by bus to New York, he recognizes a peer and intervenes rescuing fourteen years old Julie who witnessed a man murdering her parents.  Though he knows it is inane, Will helps the endangered teen unaware of a conspiracy high up the power chain ready to snuff out anyone in their way.<br /><br />This is an exciting over the top of the Washington Monument thriller starring a man who lived by the code \\"My Country, Right or Wrong\\" until the American mother and her kids incident.  Filled with betrayals, David Baldacci hooks readers with this fast-paced tale from the moment the protagonist just said no until the final confrontation.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Excellent set, with good background on the remastering process. recommended for any trekker's out there who always wanted to see the original episodes with special effects work worthy of the franchise.
B001TODO54|5.0|I have had this on my shelf to read forever.  I am not sure why it took me so long to read it.  It was an absolutely stellar adventure fantasy with a dash of romance; an excellent world with an interesting premise.  Highly recommended to those who love YA fantasy.<br /><br />When Katsa was eight years old she killed a man with her bare hands, revealing her Grace.  Some have Graces that let them cook well or run fast or sing...Katsa's Grace is to kill.  With her parents dead her uncle the King has been using her as his personal strong arm.  Whenever the King thinks someone is out of the line the King sends Katsa to torture, threaten and kill.  But Katsa is getting sick of doing the King's dirty work. Then she meets Prince Po; Prince Po is Graced with Fighting and finally Katsa has someone who can challenge her in combat.  As her and Prince Po become friends and compare notes on their separate kingdoms they realize that something is going seriously wrong in a neighboring kingdom and go on a mission to investigate and fix the problem.<br /><br />This was a seriously good book.  It has an excellent balance of interesting world-building, epic politics, fantastic action scenes, unforgettable characters, and a little romance.  The world is very well laid out.  The names of all the kings and kingdoms are a bit confusing initially but quickly you learn the layout and then things are much easier to make sense of.  I love the idea of people having Graces, it is in an interesting type of magic system, and Cashore does an excellent job of explaining the Graces.<br /><br />This book is very action packed.  Katsa is a bit easy to rile, so she is constantly lashing out and fighting people.  The fight scenes between her and Po are incredible.  The plot was very well done, the story is so well woven together and takes some interesting twists and turns.  The surprises are such that when you think back to the beginning on the story it makes perfect sense, but they are done in such a way that they are still surprising.<br /><br />Katsa is an absolutely wonderful and engaging character.  It was fun to watch her anger and hatred temper itself into something more mature as the story went on.  I love that right from the get go she is intelligant and her own person, this is evidenced by the Council she starts to protect others in the Kingdom.  Yet despite her intelligence she is somewhat emotionally stunted by the things the King has forced her to do. It was great to watch her overcome this.<br /><br />Prince Po was another exceptional character.  He adds a lightness to the story that balances Katsa's violence and has this wonderful kind of zen thing going on despite his own secrets.  Really he is the perfect counterpart to Katsa.  I loved how they are friends before they get romantic; I always love it when the romance between the two characters is actually based on a solid and respectful relationship.<br /><br />The other characters are just as endearing; they are all very well done.  I am excited to see that the most recent book is about Bitterblue because she was definitely a side character I wanted to learn more about.<br /><br />The story ends well and I think readers will be pleased.  I can't wait to read more books by Cashore.  This is probably best for older young adults.  There is a lot of violence, some torture, and one non-explicit sex scene.<br /><br />Overall an absolutely excellent fantasy book.  I loved the world, the idea of Graces, and the wonderfully engaging characters.  The plot moved fast and had a lot of very well done twists and turns; it was full of adventure, intrigue, and action.  The romance between Katsa and Po is very sweet and very well done; built on mutual respect and friendship.  I highly recommend this to fantasy lovers.  It reminds a bit of Tamora Pierce's books and Robin McKinely's The [[ASIN:0441013058 The Hero and the Crown]], but grittier.  Again highly recommended for fantasy fans young adult and older.y that they are still surprising.<br /><br />Katsa is an absolutely wonderful and engaging character.

0891419063|5.0|With the Old Breed is a simple and very entertaining read! The book provides an insight of the horrors the marines had to face as they took the relentless, stubborn, and evil Japanese army.  Sledge manages to create a master piece that gives any reader a reason to honor the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to stop  tranny and oppression from form winning.

B0075MFS9Y|5.0|After hearing 'Ho Hey' a number of times on the Current in Mpls I had to check out the rest. After listening to track 1 (Flowers in your Hair) I was already hitting the download button. Zero regrets, there isn't a dud to be heard. Lots of boot stomping and hand clapping as percussion along with some sweet melodies and beautiful lyrics. I'm not very good at writing about music but if you like stuff like the Avett Brothers or Low Anthem or The Head & the Heart I'm pretty sure you will like this. In fact, if you buy this album and you don't like it I will meet you exactly halfway between my house in Minneapolis and your house wherever that is and I will buy you a sandwich.

B006INDMEE|3.0|the actors in the movie are what prompted me to see this film. unfortunately, it just didn't gel well and my attention wandered. i think i ended up responding to emails while watching this film. not bad but not great.
B006SV2LWA|3.0|The movie was good if you just wanted to relax and pass a little time. I guess from the ads on TV, I expected a whole lot more action and energy. The Actors were good, but not convincing enough to really make this movie a hit.
B0068FZ0J2|5.0|Brilliant film to watch from start to finish..Best film of the year when it was released back in 1995..If your a fan of space travel,then this movie is for you..i recommend it..
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is really fun and there is a lot of variety of games. It passes time. the only reason I don't rate it 5 stars is Cuz I think it is difficult to unlock some of the games..but overall its cool!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a great game.  easy and fast just the way I like it to be.suggest this for everyone even little kids.
B007JRU4N0|4.0|Good movie- worth watching online. George plays this part very well.  We streamed it via Amazon to a Vizio 55\\" without a hitch.
B0061S0A64|5.0|i have to say is a very well app. it does a remarkable job visualizing the spectrum of music. it does lack instruction but is very intuitive.
B005NKGEP2|2.0|I think the plot of this book has been fairly represented in a number of reviews.  I found the book to be very slow, dull and lacking any suspense.  I wondered if I was reading the same book as some reviewers who found this book \\"clever and impressive\\". The plot was hard to follow and jumping back and forth to the past and present was irritating and confusing. A \\"spy drama\\" yes, \\"highly entertaining\\", maybe.<br />The protagonist, Kate is suppose to be a former CIA agent, but I could not believe that she worked anywhere near  the CIA. I always felt she was one or two steps behind everyone in the book. Did she lose her skills that quickly? Most of the time she overanalyzed every situation to the point of exhaustion and then...nothing!<br /><br />I pushed myself to finish the book, but in the end I was disappointed with Kate, Dexter, Julia and Bill. My apologies to the author, because I just missed his intentions entirely.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game is very addictive and im enjoyin thus far. its a little difficult to get out of the game but its still fun.
B0061S0A64|4.0|This app makes it very easy to make some trippy, relaxing music.  Just drag and drop.  The controls used to move to the different program modes isn't very intuitive, but just dropping things in creative mode is simplicity itself.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is the best zombie drama I've ever seen. Of course, I've not seen that many zombie dramas:&lt;) The dvd contains 2 discs. The episodes are on disc one, and the second disc contains the special features. Well worth your purchase. I ordered this from Amazon and it arrived quicker than expected. It was brand new and in excellent condition. Enjoy...fellow zombie fans!
B007BLCGNU|3.0|Not one of the better movies I've seen.  Quirky....then again, so perhaps was J. Edgar.<br />For the price paid to download on one of Amazon's special deals, can't complain -- but cannot recommend this as one of Leo's better films.
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather ap is a MUST HAVE. All weather, all the time, right at your fingertips. Ap is simple install, use, and reliable. Unlike other Fire users I have had no trouble with the ap (or the ads since I'm picky about that). Hopefully that means the bugs are fixed  ;())
0553386794|4.0|Though I found Martin's constant digressions annoying, the overall plot of the highly political games of these kings and queens is full of excitement and well worth reading.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Great calculator.  I have a record of what I am adding etc.  Also can calculate large numbers, such as in the millions.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is pretty good but really the only problem i have with it is that wben you are running lep slides a little bit and i sometimes hit the creatures
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is so much fun and addicting. I have to stop and tell myself to put the tablet down because I have things to do. I would highly recommend this game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Somewhat reminded me of the twilight series but without vampires and the characters actually do all the things we all hoped Bella and Edward would!<br /><br />Wonderful, naughty and very shocking!  I didn't have a clue what I was getting into when I started reading but I couldn't put it down.  I thought I wouldn't go on to read the series but the end of book 1 just made me have to continue onto book 2.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great app, does everything advertised! It's like having my computer on my phone!! Simply genius, surprisingly fast response time, almost seems unreal!! So lucky to have picked this one up for free, but well worth the money!
0393327345|5.0|And my favorite author ever!  Palahniuk is the most original author I've read.  It doesn't matter if you've seen the movie, READ the book!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I got this book (kindle version) and let me first say I love a good romance novel but this was way over the top. I had to stop reading this book. I was so angry at this girl for allowing this man to have control of her. I kept thinking I need to finish reading it since I spent the money on this book but the more I read the more angry I became. I can't understand this girl giving herself with contract to this crazy man. I can see both will people to become dominate and submissive to each other but there needs to be love. A real healthy relationship. This was all business for this man but emotion for her. I would NOT recommend this book.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|it just is...... like Mario bros but its pretty short and the controls are pretty hard to get at first but once you get it. :)))
0545265355|5.0|These are the best books I've read in a long time.  I couldn't put them down and ended up finishing all 3 in a matter of days.  They made me completely forget about those silly Twilight vampires.  Bella who???  It's all about Katniss!
0553386794|2.0|Ah yes, welcome all to the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, where the men are men and the women are bitches or sluts or bitchy sluts!<br /><br />I actually bought this book around 7-8 years ago and tried to read it twice, and both times it failed to capture my interest. However, whenever I told people this it was greeted with shock and disbelief and it was demanded of me to try it again. After it came out as a show, which was also greeted with praise, I finally decided to try it again and soldier through the immensely boring first 50-100 pages, and I did. Read the whole thing, front to back and all I have to say is...I understand why all the people demanding I read it were men.<br /><br />Martin can certainly write. The man has a gift for storytelling in his creativity and his imagination, there's no denying this. However, his characters are a bit...lacking. I think it says a lot about a fantasy author from what type of setting he chooses to set his story in, since you can basically choose anything. Martin chose a medieval type setting, where the men are strong, decisive, brave, cruel, and MANLY (well, except the eunuchs), and women are boring. Almost every woman he writes is so preoccupied with sex, being a whore, her husband, being a whore, wanting power for her son, being a whore, getting married to a prince, being a whore, or stabbing people in the back. I'd say the only females not concerned with these things are too young, but Martin is not above pedophilia. The ONE redeeming female character is also the one who gets the least attention, and that's Arya. Even Caitlyn, who's supposed to be a steadfast, strong character is still irrational and ruled by her emotions.<br /><br />Gender differences aside, I think my biggest issue with this book was just the fact that it really did take forever for things to get going. The whole reason it took me so long to force myself through this book was his pacing, everything was in fits and starts until maybe the last 100 pages or so, at which point it felt like he had to fill some kind of obligation for a large-scale war type scenario. The dynamics between the groups of characters feels a bit thin and underdeveloped. Even from the start, this book was written entirely from the imagination of the author with very little regard that his readers are not residing in his mind with him, which is a little frustrating and even a bit condescending.<br /><br />I have no interest in reading the sequels for this one and am quite disappointed in how it actually turned out. Just know what you're in for if you decide to tackle this monster.so, at which point it felt like he had to fill some kind of obligation for a large-scale war type scenario.

B004DSX5B6|5.0|I have owned other multi-tools and most of them sucked.  I would say by far this is the best I have ever seen.  This Multi-tool feels very solid and the knives are sharp and extremely functional. All of the tools lock when open all the way.  Last but not least, the pliers are the best part, again, extremely functional.

B001IYCMNA|5.0|I use this so my entertainment/sound system has an internet connection.  It does not support wireless, needs wired.  Wireless-N gives it speed.  My main router is a Cisco WRVS4400N.  After configuring the WDS feature it works.  My only criticism is that Cisco's documentation is lacking, step by step detailed guides would be great.  At first it was not working until I learned (from an Cisco support board posting) you must have the Wireless settings exactly the same, on the access point and router.  SSID1, Connection Control, etc.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This book had such an impact on me as a kid, it was fun to re-read it. I love the Jo character and really identify with her. I think it's interesting that even though it was set in the past, the concerns of the girls are very similar to those of people today. While each person wanted something different in life, they were all things I could identify with. It may be a classic, but the writing is still easy to read in current times. It moves quickly and I can see why it continues to be popular. If you haven't read this one, read it!!!!!!

B0054R6BFM|5.0|A teen novel, yet so captivating for anyone who went to high school.  You can see yourself and your actions or lack thereof, the good and the bad, how what you thought was so trivial affected those around you.  It's written in the present, yet nothing dates the novel.  No matter your age, it's just as much about the now as it is about what you may have gone through.  It's easy to look back and revise your own personal history but truthfully, which character were you?

B00000DG1R|4.0|Duran Duran have proved such resolute survivors. Roundly mocked as plastic pop by the Keep Music Live brigade when they first formed back in the post-punk/new wave days, they have hung around to the extent that they are poised to celebrate their greatest Hits<br />The CD has all the main hits  plus a few lesser known ones. Some songs are edited versions so if that is an issue, beware. This is especially evident on the Rio tracks and Ordinary World. For most people, though, these are the versions they know having heard them on the radio for 20+ years. I could say that such and such song should have been included (OK, Violence of Summer) but can not find any real fault in the selection.<br />The Reflex remains a compelling, preposterous slice of synthpop genius, a reminder that, unlike their artier peers, Duran Duran never strove to be anything more than glossy mainstream popstars.<br />The sound quality is very good which should not be a surprise; the sound quality of DD was always top class.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great game! I love the Ice Age characters, especially Scrat! I'm addicted to the mini game Kung Fu Scrat.

0439023513|1.0|To all those claiming that this book was \\"real\\" and that is why they liked it, I say you are no more right that this book was rooted in \\"reality\\" than those who are mad because it didn't have a happy ending (i.e. an unrealistic ending, as some would call that).  Anyone who has ever survived a traumatic event or a terrible war and yet have gone on and overcome and found hope and forged a future for themselves, or even have become activists and peace makers; those who have done that, and there are many, should be insulted by the message of this book.  Which is that there is no hope, no better future, that trauma can not be overcome, that war can never have a positive outcome for the individual and that there can be no emotional growth available and that no one should place faith in you because you will fail....  What an awful message for young teens to assimilate and it is not even a \\"realistic\\" message.<br /><br />This series started off with such solid potential for the human spirit of survival and rebellion and search for a better future for your children and then quickly disintegrated into a nihilistic mess of hopelessness.  The character of Katniss is a puppet in this book, without motivating force or emotional growth.  Her actions, of which there are few, dwindle down to pointlessness and the ending leaves the impression that she is dead inside.  There is much I disliked and downright hated about this book (especially compared to what it COULD have been) but the worse is this:  that even at the end, once the world has changed and there are no Hunger Games and her children have a better, safe future available, Katniss has no joy and has never been able to find life worthwhile.  She has NOT overcome.  In fact, throughout the third book, she merely submitted, was a complacent poster child, there was no fire in her.  What she did manage to do, racing towards the Capitol with her band of trusting fighters and camera men, was rendered meaningless when they nearly alldie and she DOES NOT achieve anything, because the rebels are already there and taking over for her and she once again is injured and wakes up in a hospital bed with no sense of identity (how can she have one when the author has utterly altered her?).<br /><br />Her last act of the war, concerning Coin, is done quickly but at least she does something worthwhile in this book beside wander around in a haze of self-pity and hide in closets and get injured.  This book should not have ended the way it did, at all.  Rainbows and unicorns and all other nonsense descriptions of \\"happy ever after\\" aside, because no one truly expected that, this book still did not offer up \\"reality\\", or least not the only version of it.  It offered up the image of what a \\"girl on fire\\" ALMOST was and then stomped all over it and gave the readers what a drowned rat looks like.  There was no \\"true to character\\" character in book three and the changes that take place are not changes of \\"growth\\" but more a de-evolution of the human spirit.  Of course there are people in which PTSD and war irrevocably change and forever alienate and depress.  But the opposite is true, as well.  There are those who overcome and find happiness, despite the nightmares of the past.  And this author consciously decided, perhaps in favor of her own agenda, to have Katniss be the former.  Let's hope the film version understands the error the author made in doing this and manages somehow to make it the latter.

B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game was totally awesome and fun... until it started getting extremely boring. On the other hand, it was so fun I could never put it down. Unfortunately, I had to after just two days becuz there were only 10 worlds. Lastly,towards the end, the graphics got jacked up and kept making me die, but whatever right! It was still pretty fun overall.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|All I can say about this DVD is that it is fabulous. I recommend this to all Madonna fans. LUV Madonna
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Much, much better than the recent Green Lantern flick. Some really fun action sequences, some excellent light hearted moments, good casting, acting and scripting - a very fun action flick. I am not a super help fanatic and don't read comics or graphic novels (nothing against them, just don't read 'em), yet found this movie to be a very enjoyable. I especially liked the alternate history aspect of the story, similar to the X-Men alternate history (though Captain America is a far better movie than any of the X-Men flicks). The five star rating I gave is partly by comparison to other movies in the super hero action genre, and partly because it's just a fun movie.
B007G5K066|2.0|Full of itself, and disappointing. Hard to follow at first until you realize it's trying to more complex than it really is. I am perfectly fine with movies that move at a deliberate pace, but this one falls into a slow pace and never builds any real steam. This slow pace seems to be another factor contributing to the filmmakers' belief that the movie is more momentous than it is; the slowness isn't sophisticated pacing, as with some movies - it's just slowness. Gary Oldman's low key performace is fine, but not enough to salvage the movie
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I can say one thing for sure, this is a Five Star Album!<br /><br />This will go down as one of the masterpieces of American rock music during this era. The Foo's have gone into some other rock and roll musical realm here, and just knocked it out of the park. where did this energy and creativity come from, because it is in full force here throughout the entire album.<br /><br />Grohl's song writing has NEVER been stronger, the hooks have NEVER been better, and the musicianship has NEVER been stronger than it is here. Thats saying alot considering that the Foo Fighters have always been one of the most consistant bands out there, not one of their albums is below par. When they enter the studio, something good is going to come out. However with \\"Wasting Light\\" they have taken it all a step further, as if any of us thought that was possible.<br /><br />\\"These Are My Famous Last Words!\\" Grohl yells, as the first track \\"Bridge Burning\\" opens the album with an absolute roar, and does not let up in the slightest. We then find ourselves at the next brilliant track \\"Rope\\" released as a single, I cannot get enough of that call and response thing going on with the guitars, and the chorus, well, it's one of there catchiest since \\"Learning to Fly\\".<br /><br />Then things take a slight turn with \\"Dear Rosemary\\" (by that I mean we slow down a little), a song that doesn't sound like anything they've really done before musically, a great tune with assistance from Husker Du frontman Bob Mould. It 'sounds' like a Foo Fighter song for sure, I think it must be the back up assistance in the chorus that makes it sound slightly different from their usual stuff. The album then comes back full force with \\"White Limo\\", this is most l;ikely the heaviest song Foo Fighters have ever done. Quick paced and loud, very very loud!<br /><br />The next track, and second personal favorite on the album is \\"Arlandria\\", this is that one song thats on every Foo Fighters album, the one that gets stuck in yourhead, and won't get out. That's okay though because it's an amazing track that is very well written and performed. One of the stand out tracks.<br /><br />The album continues at a similar pace with the following four tracks, all of which are fantastic, and great additions to the Foo's song list.<br /><br />Then we come to the two closing tracks \\"I should Have Known\\" and \\"Walk\\", which are probably or very close to being two of the best songs that the Foo Fighters have ever written or performed. The 1st \\"I Should Have Known\\" find Grohl diving into an emotional state lyrically hasn't been present before, seriously the hasn't written this deep since, well, I cant think of another track that hits this level of intensity. I am not going to pretend to know what this song is about, the singer knows, and people have expressed opinions, one of which is Kurt Cobain. However, one could apply the song to many things, the fact of the matter is that it's a damn good song! Very dark.<br /><br />Finally the closer \\"Walk\\", which brings us back full circle, cranking up a the tempo with a slow builder that ends the album on a very very high note, leaving you excited about the next Foo Fighters album. The song is a great closer because it sounds like a refresher, and a nostalgic song all at the same time. Almost like \\"we're moving forward, but always keeping our past in mind\\". A perfect note for closing, what is the best album they have put together, to date that is. Always looking forward to a new one!<br /><br />Also, on a side note, for a lot more info on this album and the process they went through, plus a complete history of the band, check out the new documentary \\"Back and Forth\\" it's great!

B006T3RM08|3.0|I got the Clique Apple Wireless Keyboard and TrackPad dock tray for Christmas. I was thrilled. Unfortunately the fabrication tolerances for the TrackPad portion of the tray are just not correct or the design erred on the too tight end of the specification. Like others on here, my trackpad had just enough space to click once or twice in the space provided by the tray and would jam in the down (clicked) position. I use the tap to click feature anyway so no problem there. There is no really good substitute for ACTUAL clicking when it comes to dragging. The double-tap and hold feature takes a lot of coordination and it is pretty useless.<br /><br />I was so disappointed I was about to return it. The issue was clearly a 'clearance' issue inside the tray along the bottom edge of the tray on the TrackPad side. So I was confident I could fix it. I just took out my exacto knife and carefully trimmed plastic away inside the tray until the TrackPad had the space to click and return to the non-clicked position. It took a few trims and tries but it works every time now and you would have to look very close to see the trim work.<br /><br />I'm NOT saying this makes the accessory acceptable. It should not be up to the customer to modify a product that should work out of the box. Had they put more time into testing and had tighter controls on manufacturing with maybe a less tight fix for the TrackPad it would be an awesome product. For now it is just acceptable if you want to go to the effort to make it work.<br /><br />Hope this helps some of you that kept the product.

B004ETVAH0|3.0|I was thrilled to find this at my local library. It seemed a bit odd that Jeff Beck, perhaps the greatest electric guitarist standing today (Yeah, I know Clapton is still alive. Yeah I know Bonamassa is the new king...) lent his name and image to this project, despite the whole idea of respect for Les Paul. The cover photo makes Beck look a little like Rick Derringer circa 1973 and the overall effect isn't far from that. It is grossly overproduced and lacking in any sort of serious intent. The singing rapily grates on the nerves. I don't want to rain on the people's parades here who posted overwhelmingly positive reviews, but I like my guitar playing with some heft; this album is all rather unfortunate fluff. I didn't see the TV show, so maybe I missed the connection but this album is going back ASAP.
1400069289|5.0|This was a great book that truly makes you look at your own life in relation to the things that you do everyday. At the same time the author makes a great case on how you can change your life easily with small changes that can become habit! AT the same time, you have to be careful of the habits that you do not want in your life and I loved that he likened this to something that you have to quit. What I loved about the book were the stories and real examples that the author uses to illustrates points. He makes the book come alive and stand out from just an ethereal research driven approach, to a much more practical approach that allows the reader to connect and engage not only with the topic but with the stories and the people within them too.  This is a great book that I would highly encourage all to read and learn from!
B0073U2FB2|1.0|Bad start of a dumb, factually incorrect, and doesn't make a bit of sense opening scene of a star map with little Pacman dashes moving across it and making 2D 90 degree turns. Another cheap ripoff of the recently popular scenes of aliens slowing descending in mass numbers onto Earth to wreck havoc. Another cheap ripoff of the vamp movie genre CGI showing people disintegrating into swirling ashes. Dumb physics that would embarrass a high school science student. A cheap prop of something called a microwave gun that was probably borrowed from '50s scifi. Surprisingly, the quickest/easiest solution in killing the aliens, shown at the beginning, was to throw some booze on them - specifically it's the alcohol, and they self immolate. The usual scattered cars and other trash on the streets. The usual small enclaves of humans fighting to the end and the usual submarine waiting to rescue some survivors.<br /><br />Overall - bad acting, bad dialogue, cheap knockoff writing, bad CGI.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I was pretty speculative that such a small amp would make a difference, but I was wrong.  This little E6 is wonderful.  I using it with both a set of iGrado's and a set Shur SRH840 s and a line out doc on my iPad.  Wow, what a difference, the clarity and fidelity are amazing.  This little E6 not pumps up the volume but it also brings out those previously unheard details in the music you already love.  Now I'm considering the E11 at some point in the future.
0393064476|5.0|The author is to be congratulated for his win, and his work. This is an interesting thesis, and though by no means a perfect work, certainly helps trace the way critical thinking with respect to the classics, particularly Lucretius, helped spur the intellectual curiosity that spurred what we now term the Renaissance, after the Middle Ages.  Greenblatt was one of the first scholars to point out how much we actually had in common with the people of Shakespeare's time. Along with Jonathan Dollimore, they highlighted the fact that all of the modern concerns we have experienced in the past 30 years were experienced in Shakespeare's time as well, and how competing discourses bring about a change in society. The book is a stimulating and thought-provoking discussion and anyone reading it with an open mind and spirit of inquiry will enjoy this interesting book.

B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Earlier this year when I first started seeing this movie advertised I thought, \\"Oh no! Not another 9/11 movie!\\"  The more I learned about it, I was curious.  After seeing it was based on a book, I had to read it.  The book was extremely frustrating at times, but incredibly rewarding by the end.<br /><br />I immediately warmed up to the kid, Oskar Schell, as a character. He's a cute little kid with a sense of humor, big heart, big imagination, one who asks too many questions. But as the central character, telling his story in first person, you have to remember how any real kid affected from 9/11 might react to losing a family member that day, how would they process it years later?<br /><br />Sure, Oskar's story is an adventure - both physical and emotional - as he finds a key that he believes is a clue left by his father and he goes in search of the lock it opens. But the real journey is Oskar seeking answers to questions, and in truth, trying to find out what those questions are.<br /><br />Oskar's adventure is the movie's focus as it should be.  In the book, he shares half the pages with the story of his grandparents. I found myself skimming through their sections anyway, so I was glad Hollywood did not spend much time there either. The story of Oskar's grandparents does play a crucial part in the film, but it remains a very minor plot line. This being said, I was very curious as to how the movie would end, and though it was completely different from the book I have to say I was well satisfied.<br /><br />The book has a lot of artistic value to it.  It contains random pictures, scribblings, strange justifications of text, stream of consciousness type stuff. But that's what gives Oskar's character his voice.  Surprisingly, a lot of this comes across in the movie quite perfectly.  And for that, I found the movie to be as equally rewarding.
0345803485|1.0|I could not finish this book.  Gross, gross, gross!  The story is dry, the characters are boring, and the overly described sex scenes are just gross.  This is not a romance novel.  It's just plain old porn - tasteless and disqusting.  Don't waste your money.

0545265355|5.0|If you're going to read the first book, you'll want to read the other 2 as well so why not just buy the trilogy? Hard back books last longer than paperback and it's worth spending a little extra money to get something that lasts.

B006H5120E|5.0|I saw the 3D version of this film over the weekend. The first time I saw this film, I liked it a lot but admittedly I spent too much time focusing on special effects and the general razzle dazzle of an enormous spectacle.<br />This time around gave me the opportunity to just watch the movie. I, like a lot of people, have recently been immersed (or drowning) in Titanic related books, DVDs, and television programs. Overall, I've learned quite a bit. The one thing that has come out of all of this is just how good a film this is. I'd label this movie's genre historical fiction. James Cameron threw in the subplot of the Rose De Witt Butaker and Jack Dawson romance to get this film made, but the real star is the Titanic. Everything about the ship's first and only voyage and its descent into temporary oblivion is not only well done but done in exacting detail given what was known in 1997 when this movie was made. The real passengers and crew are portrayed with accuracy and the Rose/Jack story slides into this mosaic seamlessly.<br />As for the 3D process, I really didn't know what to expect. I had heard some negative comments which were not specific. I thought the criticism might be comparable to what was said about colorization when b&w movies were being altered from their original format. That was an idea that came and went because the technology was poor at best and it was distracting. The 3D aspect of Titanic works. It isn't jarring or gimmicky or a grossly imperfect technology; strange objects such as the bow of the Titanic don't shoot out at you. There is no freak show here. The technology, which I have to assume is not only costly but time consuming, enhances a really nice photography job by adding depth and dimension. Clearly if you are a movie purist and don't like tweaking you won't want to see Titanic 3D. I'm o.k. with the enhancement and think Cameron & his people made a very well done movie even better.<br />Overall, this was a great viewing experience and was the 3D enhancement was not distracting as far as I am concerned. I enjoyed the opportunity to pay attention to a the wonderful small details I missed the first time around and am pleased to see this being introduced to a new generation of movie viewers.the 3D enhancement was not distracting as far as I am concerned.

B0052U59F4|3.0|I was curious as to what all the raving about as to how fabulous this book series was reported to be.<br />I found the book to be entertaining and it had an unusual subject matter. I suppose that if the reader has never experienced this type of sex, it would be fascinating.<br />It became repetitive and a bit unbelievable at times. The handsome billionaire was deeply attracted to this average looking college student. Then, the amount of sex they had, became very unlikely and physically unbelievable, in my opinion. She would bite her lip and he would get so turned on that he's HAVE to have sex. After awhile, the lip biting became a bit much. Oh well, count me in the minority of people who would not recommend this book.
0345803485|5.0|I see why this is a New York Times bestseller! Loving it...halfway through book one, can't wait for the nest two books to come at the end of the week.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I wanted to read the books because of all of the frenzy about how great these books were. The first book was entertaining and different.<br />The second book was more of the first. I found the whole idea of this handsome billionaire being attracted to this average looking college student a little far fetched. Then after you found out what the lead character's taste for sex was, it was all down hill, in my opinion.<br />It was very unrealistic... I mean, she would bite her lip and he would get so turned on, he'd  have to have sex with her. My God, her lips had to be bloody, because she continuously was biting her lips. And how many times a day did they have sex? Geeze....it almost got boring after the first twenty times. So, thumbs down from me. I didn't buy the third book in the series as I figured it would just be more lip biting, etc. etc.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read these books because my 14 year old daughter really wanted me to read them.  I was hesitant because of the disturbing nature of the books and I didn't want to make a commitment to read a whole series.  I'm a slow reader and I read the whole series in less than a month. The books were addicting and I was drawn in immediately.  I am glad that the movie stays close to the book, from what I hear.  I'm looking forward to seeing it.
0545265355|1.0|I love the Hunger Games series, and it ranks in the top three of my favorite books of all time.

B001AVCFK6|1.0|Chris Pine is,and never will be,Captain James Tiberous Kirk.He doesn't look,sound,or act like William Shatner-even the color of their eyes is different.Bad choice for Kirk.Zachary Quinto will never,ever be Spock-he reminds me of Jim Carey as Lloyd in \\"Dumb and Dumber\\".The only one of the new cast who looks,acts,and sounds like the original character is Karl Urban.His over the top performance as Dr.Leonard H.McCoy(son of David)was spot on and the only real bright spot/stand out character in the whole movie.Don't even get me started on the J.J.-Prise.After months and months of anticipation of finally seeing the original on a movie screen the JJ-Prise was a huge disappointment.Bad idea to replace a beautifully designed original vessel with something so ungainly looking and ugly.This movie has lowered Trek from it's high and lofty Roddenberry years when everything was story driven with lots of believable,likeable characters and replace all of that with something as action and special effects driven as this movie is- without any real character development or hope-filled message of a brighter future for humanity-kind of  like Star trek goes Star Wars( Star Wars was,and always has been,mindless entertainment for the masses especially Episode 1 The Phantom Menace,which is easily the stupidest entry in that series).Bring back the good old days of classic Trek and leave this mindless JJ Abrams reboot to rot.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Edgar Rice Burrough's Barsoom novels and Andrew Stanton's film exceeded all my expectations. Disney totally screwed this film with its weak marketing campaign. Why they didn't set this film up as a \\"From the creator of Tarzan\\" that would have gotten alot more name recognition.<br />Thanks to the overseas box office John Carter might have a future.<br /><br />The critics just jumped all over this film with its huge budget and a  $30,180,188 opening weekend, yet Mission impossible Ghost protocol's budget was $145 million and opened with $29,556,629, and was heralded as a \\"success\\". That seemed more a reaction to having some ammo to shoot off at Disney then based actually on the film itself. For example, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave John Carter a \\"D\\" and Wraith of the Titans a \\"-B\\".... explain that other than some payola scam.<br />This film has it all, especially a compelling story, see it if you can. I've already pre-order the home version.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was actually dreading reading Mockingjay due to the many mixed reviews. I ended up feeling satisfied by the ending of the trilogy. Not &#34;feel good&#34; happy but these books were ultimately written about war and its effects. Of course Katnis would be traumatized by all of the horrors she went through. All of the characters were traumatized in their own way. I think the point of the trilogy is that both sides in a war are not blameless and ultimately no one wins. Loved ones on both sides get killed over whoever thinks they're &#34;right&#34;. The fact that Katnis found a way to survive in the end like how we originally found her surviving in the woods is the theme of these books. She's a survivor.
B005KCGIUY|2.0|I have been a Tool fan since Undertow -- I became aware of Opiate only after the release of Undertow. I really like A Perfect Circle as well, although admittedly I didn't care for eMOTIVe except for the one track \\"Passive\\".<br /><br />In my estimation, this CD is not even as good as eMOTIVe, although it is better than the last Puscifer CD (which I didn't even want to get after listening carefully to 90-second previews of all of the tracks while reading lyrics online). After listening carefully all the way through a number of times, there was one track on this CD that I was prepared to add to my iPod: \\"The Weaver\\" (which could have been a track by APC). The rest were -- in my estimation -- dumb or too weird or simply annoying.<br /><br />This band is a side project for Maynard, and obviously he doesn't want to sound like his other work. Fine, but I don't like this band; I still don't really like their sound (although it's an improvement over their last album), and I still don't like their songwriting (except for the one track). I mention Tool and APC just so people will know where I'm coming from. Also, for the sake of completeness, let me mention that I really like Maynard's work with the Deftones (\\"Passenger\\", from the album White Pony), and it turns out that I don't really care for the Deftones (I like only one other track by them: \\"MX\\", from Around the Fur).

0307352145|4.0|Would you consider yourself an introvert?  Do you prefer to be alone, delving into your interests?<br /><br />At least one-third of the people we know could be considered introverts.<br /><br />But introversion is a complex trait, as well as a long misunderstood one.<br /><br />Susan Cain has produced a roaring motto for the introvert in her book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.<br /><br />On the Spectrum<br /><br />Research has shown that people usually fall somewhere on a line between pure extroversion and introversion.  There are as many kinds of introverts as there are types of people.  Personal histories, family and relational dynamics, and personality combine to create a unique situation.<br /><br />Forcing Collaboration and Killing Creativity?<br /><br />In her book, Susan explores the ideas that American society has for too long promoted the \\"Culture of Personality\\"- based on the idea of selling yourself and your innovation with extrovert traits.<br /><br />The research she includes in her book is enough to convince anyone not to value group collaboration over individual creativity.  Study after study shows that the mother of creativity is solitude- and introverts often catapult ideas and inventions through their ability to shut everything else out and focus on a single task.<br /><br />There are plenty of examples given in the book including a personal favorite: Steve Wozniak.  He says in his memoir, and it is repeated in Susan's book:<br /><br />Work alone. You're going to be best able to design revolutionary products and features if you're working on your own.  Not on a committee.  Not on a team.<br /><br />Cultivating Quiet Kids<br /><br />My favorite chapter in the book was 11 entitled: On Cobblers and Generals- How to Cultivate Quiet Kids in a World That Can't Hear Them.<br /><br />In this chapter is a wealth of motivation for parents of introverted children.  There are also tools to help you celebrate and encourage their introverted style, rather than pressuring them to become more \\"social\\".<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that Susan didn't offer up homeschooling as a viable alternative to introverted children who just didn't fit in school.  I was hoping she would go there after reading quotes such as this:<br /><br />We often marvel at how introverted, geeky kids \\"blossom\\" into secure and happy adults.  We liken it to a metamorphosis.  However, maybe it's not the children who change but their environments.<br /><br />and:<br /><br />We tend to forget that there's nothing sacrosanct about learning in large classrooms, and that we organize students this way not because it's the best way to learn but because it's cost-efficient, and what else would we do with our children while the grown-ups are at work?<br /><br />But alas, her advice only reaches towards hand-picking the school your child attends, and if that is not possible, encouraging their activities outside the classroom.<br /><br />There is so much more in this book that I can't cover in one review.  Susan talks about nature vs nurture- can we ever escape the introverted traits?  She touches on how introverts might want to pick up some extrovert tactics, public speaking, how introverts are viewed in businesses and other extrovert-heavy work environments, and much, much more.
B000LB7G00|4.0|This mouse does as advertised.  Its a bit temperamental at times where it feels like ...well best way to explain it.. like it needs an alignment and pulls to the right or the left.  In most cases after a few hard resets its fine.  I'm a very light user since the only use I've ever had for it was to build or edit items in a game.  Now like I mentioned that I'm a light user, it was surprising that the coating on the black part of the mouse started to chap and flake off.  I do not know if this is due to heat or cold being that my flat is usually kept at a moderate temperature.  This does not impede performance, but since one of the good things that can be said about this device is that its a very attractive device. It now looks worn and ragged, which would be understandable if i was a heavy user, but like I've already mentioned, I'm not.  I know this sounds sorta silly and I'm not one to usually write reviews, but since this does sport a hefty price tag,well guess i can split hairs4.  Would I recommend this mouse?  Yes I would!  Someone mentioned that this is a tool and all tools look good at the start.  Hope this review helps.

B005LAIHAY|2.0|Prison films have been a staple of the film industry from the earliest days. They have garnered Oscars (\\"The Big House\\") and BAFTAs (\\"Birdman of Alcatraz\\"), generated block buster hits (\\"The Great Escape\\", Papillon\\"), and helped change public policy (\\"I was a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\\"). Almost every major male actor has been in prison at least once (Wallace Beery, Chester Morris, Robert Montgomery, John Garfield, Warner Baxter, Boris Karloff, Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Tom Hanks, Gene Wilder, Richard Pryor, Malcolm McDowell, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwartznegger, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Jon Voigt, Wesley Snipes, Ving Rhames, Denzel Washington, Kurt Russell, Jason Statham, Edward Norton, Nicholas Cage) and some two of more times (Cagney, Bogart, Raft, Connery, McQueen).<br /><br />Prison films are so numerous that they have sub genres - women in prison (\\"Chained Heat\\"), prisoner of war (\\"The Great Escape\\"), chain gang films (\\"Cool Hand Luke\\"), foreign prison films (\\"Midnight Express\\"), prison comedies (\\"The Longest Yard\\", \\"Stir Crazy\\"), biographies (\\"The Prisoner of Shark Island\\"), and prison in space films. In this last category some recent examples include - Outland (1981), Critters (1986), Fortress (1993), No Escape (1994), Judge Dredd (1995), Pitch Black (2000), The Chronicles of Riddick (2004), and Alien Uprising (2009).<br /><br />The latest addition to the \\"prison in space\\" genre is \\"Lockout\\", a 2012 film from Luc Besson starring Guy Pearce as an ex CIA agent sent into a maximum security space prison to rescue the daughter of the President (Maggie Grace) who is being held hostage by prisoners led by crazed (Joseph Gilgun) and nasty (Vincent Regan) brothers.<br /><br />Any film from Luc Besson (1959) is worth viewing. Since 1981 Besson has been writing, directing, and/or producing films like \\"Le Femme Nikita\\" (1990), \\"The Fifth Element\\" (1997), \\"The Transporter\\" (2002), \\"Taken\\" (2008), \\"District 13\\" (2009) and my very favorite Besson film, \\"Leon - The Professional\\" (1994). He's won a BAFTA (\\"Nil By Mouth\\"), a Cesar (\\"The Fifth Element\\"), and a Wrangler (\\"The 3 Burials of Melquiades Estrada\\") and earned more than 40 nominations in film festivals.<br /><br />Australia born Guy Pearce (1967) is a great actor who has given memorable performances in films like \\"LA Confidential\\" (1997), \\"Memento\\" (2001), \\"The Proposition\\" (2005), \\"The Hurt Locker\\" (2008), and \\"The King's Speech\\" (2010), and he won an Emmy for his role in the TV mini series \\"Mildred Pierce\\" (2011). Pearce has pumped himself up physically for this role, and also seemingly spent time watching Bruce Willis films in order to get the requisite \\"cynical but sarcastic\\" persona down right. He does OK, although we've seen it one too many times to be intrigued.<br /><br />Beautiful Maggie Grace (1983) plays the damsel in distress. She's best known for her role as Shannon in the TV series \\"Lost\\" (2004-10), and if this film is any gauge, that's how she will be known.<br /><br />The only real treat, from an acting perspective, is Lennie James (1965) who is best known for his role on the TV series \\"Jericho\\" (2006-8) as the government agent with ambiguous ties to the resistance.<br /><br />The film has many problems. The villain is not really so scary that we are worried about the fate of our hero and his damsel, nor is there really anything so sinister in the \\"behind the scenes\\" machinations of the government despite a small sub plot that fails to ignite. Nor are there any special special effects (e.g., they use guns), and the camerawork is all too ordinary. Roger Ebert gave it 2 ½ stars; the NY Times called it \\"as dopey an entertainment as imaginable\\"<br /><br />Apparently Besson forgot the formula that made so many of his films among the very best of their genre -<br /><br />- A hero should be tough, but also vulnerable - think Jean Reno from \\"The Professional\\" or Anne Parillaud from \\"La Femme Nikita\\"<br /><br />- Thehero should be helped by a flawed sidekick - think Danny Aiello from \\"The Professional\\" or Tcheky Karyo from \\"La Femme Nikita\\" or Chris Tucker from \\"The Fifth Element.\\"<br /><br />- The \\"damsel in distress\\" should be attractive but vulnerable - think Natalie Portman from \\"The Professional\\" or Milo Jovovich from \\"The Fifth Element\\".<br /><br />- The villain should be really scary but also capable for being a clever adversary - think Gary Oldman from \\"The Professional\\" and also from \\"The Fifth Element\\", or Jean Reno from \\"La Femme Nikita\\"<br /><br />Lockout earned $6.2 million in its opening weekend which is respectable, earning a rank of about 100 out of 2100 openings.<br /><br />Bottom line - all too forgettable.hero should be helped by a flawed sidekick - think Danny Aiello from \\"The Professional\\" or Tcheky Karyo from \\"La Femme Nikita\\" or Chris Tucker from \\"The Fifth Element.\\"<br /><br />- The \\"damsel in distress\\" should be attractive but vulnerable - think Natalie Portman from \\"The Professional\\" or Milo Jovovich from \\"The Fifth Element\\".<br /><br />- The villain should be really scary but also capable for being a clever adversary - think Gary Oldman from \\"The Professional\\" and also from \\"The Fifth Element\\", or Jean Reno from \\"La Femme Nikita\\"<br /><br />Lockout earned $6.2 million in its opening weekend which is respectable, earning a rank of about 100 out of 2100 openings.<br /><br />Bottom line - all too forgettable.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|quell is a perfect game I love it.  it works well with the kindle fire.  I recommend it to anyone
B005P3NPXG|5.0|This is a wonderful followup to his first Soul album.  There are some beautiful rereleases of some of his best work.  Loved it.
B002RI9PKO|4.0|I found this book highly interesting and entertaining. It reads very well and is a true page turner.<br />However, the reason for the lacking 5th star, would be that slightly too much attention has been but on making it an entertaining read, I would like slightly more detail around some of the areas explored. However, this might be just right for many readers.<br /><br />Anyway, I thought this is a fresh, smart and entertaining look at assumptions that society have accepted for a long time. Actually a comforting read if your career is not going quite as well as you would hope, and there are some ideas to work with.<br /><br />As a parent to be, there was also a few pointers that I will take to heart, for an example, the child is to be born in November, Ice-hockey will probably not be his sport...<br /><br />Enjoy
B0061S0A64|5.0|I don't usually review apps but I did for this one. Node beat is a really fun music app for anyone. Its easy for people of any musicall skill type (or no musical skill at all) to pick up and mess around with. No matter what you do, the app manages to create interesting melodies, soundscapes, and beats. The music you create with it is so interesting you could get this app just for the sake of listening to music. recommend this app to virtually everyone, be you a musician, music lover, or casual app User looking for something new.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think its pretty cool and you cant beat the price of free I just got it so I haven't had the update problem others had I do hope that does get fixed so it don't happen to me
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was a very good read. I couldn't put it down till I read all the way through! I can see why other people rave about the book. I can't wait to read the next one.
B003UESJFG|5.0|This has captured my husbands attention as well as our 3 and 5 year olds!  Love the plot, the dialog and the message!  This one never gets old!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|luv it it is great plz get it ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved the show and will be looking forward to season three.<br /><br />The acting is really good and I like the story line. Season two did not have any questionable scenes (season one did) and I appreciate that.
B000MRA5NS|3.0|This is one of the few movies that I bought prior to watching it. I've always enjoyed the early Bond movies with Sean Connery and some with Roger Moore but kind of lost interest in the late 80s. I picked this up for $21.89 in Feb 2012  which is not cheap considering all the great prices Amazon offers on many Blu-ray titles (now I see that it is currently not available directly from Amazon).<br /><br />The movie was OK. I was a little disappointed because I was expecting it to be a great movie reading all the positive reviews. Some action scenes were exaggerated  and contrived, especially the chase scene early in the movie. I don't want to give too many details if you have not seen it but that scene from start-to-finish was filled with excessive and unrealistic action sequences and ends up in way that contradicts Bond's character.<br /><br />As the plot thickens, the movie gets more interesting. Blu-ray transfer is really good as expected. If you are a fan of action movies and a casual fan of Bond franchise, you will probably enjoy this. But if you are cautious about the exagerrated action sequences and loyal to original Bond concept, you may find this not to your taste.
B003MC5N28|2.0|I guess I didn't realize that this was written for someone's whose brain has not gone past 12.<br /><br />The best children's or young adult books don't every write *for* that crowd... this one tries hard to dumb down ideas, words, vocabulary--the whole thing.<br /><br />Wish I could get my money back.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game....I cant wait to play it after work lol...its awesome I think. ppl should for sure get this game they will love it as well.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Lots of fun for any age! I highly recommend this app! There is always something to do and quests are not impossible to accomplish!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|loaded this twice and both times it checked for updates and said I was not connected to the web. I was looking forward to playing but could never get past that point
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is so much fun. It's kinda like Mario Bros. The game should have more level. Try it yourself :)
B001PPF12G|5.0|This collection is so very worth the money. An already excellent album is taken to the max with all the outstanding B-sides and very cool videos in one package. The excerpts from the Astoria show are fabulous and I would definitely consider getting the entire dvd. The other videos and live performances only prove that their live performance quality is virtually spot on time and time again.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it is a little hard to tap a specific item and waiting on energy Sufis but other than that it is a great time filler
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is very entertaining! the only down side, which others have been quick to complain about is that you run out of energy somewhat quickly, which is fine because it regenerates 1 energy every 3 minutes. I already have enough distractions as it is, so I just take a break for a couple hours while I wait for it to regen.  no biggie!
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Although this segment of the series strays away from the previous 2 games, it follows a Tower Defence-ish gameplay. The player must try and defeat the waves and each boss at the end of the final wave to continue. Series trademarks such as fairies, purchasing your arms and armor, and special skills. I rate the game 3 stars because of the time it takes to (1) Level up and earn coin, (2) kill off the second round waves, and (3) the inability to survive during a boss engagement. Download this even though you'll probably rage quit during the 5th round, at the earliest.
0345803485|1.0|Ok, firstly, to say this book was based on Twilight-- this book IS Twilight (For the record, I enjoy Twilight for what it is, but certainly don't consider it literary gold).  It's an all-human version with name changes and BDSM.  Christian/Edward saves Ana/Bella from nearly getting hit by a bike messenger/car, Jose/Jake \\"puts the moves\\" on Ana/Bella only to have a jealous Christian/Edward freak out.  Kate/ Rosalie and Elliot/Emmett are passionate and physical. There were literally exact scenes taken from Twilight with a few tweaks.  Granted, this would all be fine if this were simply a fanfiction on a free website (as it originated) but to charge money for it and get praised for it?  Girls (and guys) if you like this book, read the original (Twilight) or head over to some fan fiction websites for well-written Twilight smut.  Good for the author I guess, but how has there not been a lawsuit?<br /><br />I don't even want to start on the BDSM.  I love me some sex scenes in books, I even enjoy some light scenes of control.  But seriously.  It was overdone, clinical (but explicit) and frankly, unrealistic.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, I read it for the car-crash factor. I just couldn't look away.
B004KZDV8E|4.0|Pros:<br /> - Extremely fast dual core CPU<br /> - Includes hyper-threading<br /> - 7.1 out of 7.9 on WEI<br /> - Stock Intel cooler is fairly quiet<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - No turbo-boost<br /> - Stock Intel cooler has somewhat troublesome plastic push-pin mechanisms that hold the cooler to the motherboard. When installing these I carefully tried to apply the same amount of pressure to each pin, but one pin went in too far and seemed to break pretty easily. I thought I damaged my CPU and motherboard. Luckily I did not, but now that push-pin will not come out. It seems I will probably have to carefully cut the plastic pin off if I ever want to remove the cooler and/or the CPU.<br /><br />I still believe the stock cooler works fairly well as it is quiet and every time I check the BIOS it seems to be keeping the CPU temperature consistently low. The installation issue with the pins could be attributed to me not being careful enough, but I feel the pins are not designed very well and that one of them could have been defective. Regardless of the cooler, the CPU itself deserves at least 4 stars for it's performance even without turbo-boost or overclocking capability.<br /><br />Some of my reasoning for buying this product:<br />Diablo III is finally being released and I was long overdue for a new computer anyways (was running a Pentium 4 with Windows XP Pro...very sad I know). Obviously an i3 (1st or 2nd gen) is a gargantuan leap over the Pentium 4...but some people may not realize that the i3 completely blows the Diablo III minimum CPU specifications out of the water and turns the water into vapor. But still...<br /><br />After purchasing my i3-2120 I started worrying it was already obsolete and maybe I should have sprung for a i5-2500K because of all the overclocking hype. After all, Intel themselves say the i3 is only smart, while the i7 is a genius.<br /><br />How much more performance do you really get from a i5 or i7 quad core processor? Well according to the Windows Experience Index, it might not be as much as you think. After Windows Experience Index scored my i3-2120 at 7.1 (on a scale of 1 - 7.9) I started to really doubt that the i5 or i7 were really worth the cost to performance increase ($100+ extra for .1 - .8 more on the WEI scale). For the time being, the extra cost most likely isn't worth it for most computer users and gamers.<br /><br />Like many other reviews state, most current software, even popular new games like Diablo III (#1 selling game on Amazon, 737 days in Top 100) are really only going to utilize single and/or dual core threading; and if in fact there is more threads needed, the i3 has hyper-threading capability which is described as having two virtual cores running with the two physical cores to enable quad core type threading.<br /><br />When the cost of 2nd generation quad core Intel CPUs goes down and the majority of software being produced actually utilizes quad core CPUs then I will believe they are worth my extra hard earned cash. By then Diablo IV will be out and I will have had AT LEAST a few years of exceptional performance and quality use from a $127 Intel CPU.ws Experience Index, it might not be as much as you think.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|it wont open to play it s like it just quits running..pain in the a$$ app taking up space on my device.l I don't recommend if it does not get tweeked. never opened.  only downloaded and then it checked for updates.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|YOU COOK EVERTHIING. PLUS YOU HAVE NEIIGHBORS WHO HELP YOU FIIX THIINGS UP IIN YOUR RESTURANT. BUT BEWARE SOMEONE ELSE CWN STEAL YOUR UNIIQUE STYLE. LOL BUT FOR THE LONG RUN,  I WOULD DEFF IINVIITE ALL MY FRIIENDS IIN THIIS GAME.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This is a really good CD of two of my favorite artists singing together. There are tunes that I have on several other albums, but I don't have any of them singing together. And since I couldn't see them live, I really like to play this on my lazy/cozy days. It's very laid back, and a good pick to add to my collection. Plus, of course, the DVD is cool, too. Sometimes I'm just in the mood to watch.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This triology was worth the read! I would never have chosen this book from reading the back cover as I normally prefer to read \\"fluff\\". I couldn't put these books down excellent reading!
B00571F26Y|5.0|First off, this book is not an easy read, it's very technical and a lot of the medical info went right over my head, but that's ok since the author is also good at paraphrasing for those of us non-MD type people.<br /><br />It was very painful to realize that what we are being told about \\"healthy low-fat, whole grain\\" products is what is ultimately hurting us. It is a wake up call that I hope will become more mainstream as time goes on.<br /><br />It's scary in a good way. Like reading Science Fiction that you just know will come true.
B0055SWM08|4.0|The game works as advertised.  It's easy but not too easy to be challenging as you progress through levels.  The game is easy to learn so I think my older grand kids will like it.  The six and eight year Ole's may have trouble with it.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because I don't want to use facebook to get full benefit of game hints.  I refuse to use facebook.  I want my privacy and that includes the websites I visit.
