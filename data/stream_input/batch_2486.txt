B000I9YWDO|5.0|My boy friend told me to watch this movie, I never had when it first came out but I can see why it is a cult classic with IT, and those that work in an office setting.
B007SGM084|1.0|This author is so repetitive. If I could stand to re-read the trilogy, I would sit with a pen and paper and mark down how many times she used the same phrases (&#34;Fair point well made&#34;) and words (beguiled). Also, there are only about three actual BDSM scenes in the whole trilogy. Suffice to say if you love &#34;vanilla sex&#34; (her term), read with wild abandon. If you really want a good BDSM story, look elsewhere.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Being a moon watcher I love this app. It tells you everything once you enter your location. I was joking about the werewolf alert because that's the only thing that it needs to be complete!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Book following Fall of Giants by Ken Follet and both are 5 star. I highly recommend if you like a book you regretfully put down and really look forward to getting back to it. Follet is an excellent writer!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome. I absolutely love it. being a animal lover I love realistic games. however most crash but this didn't. its a must buy
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|I liked Vampire Weekend's last album, and this one does a really good job of building on the sound of that album but is still clearly its own album.

B000FBJFSC|5.0|I love the details of those times and humor of the family to deal with those difficult times. Even though the young family had much of nothing, they had the love of each other and family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very nice game because it exercises my hand and the video experience is so nice and infact the game is interesting.

1476734941|5.0|I enjoyed Michael Mosley's book tremendously. the idea of fasting 2 days each week is well articulated, backed up by his scientific approach, and punctuated with wonderful humor! the book's approach is extremely practical. I'm about to begin the 5:2 and I am expecting great success!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It is very fun to make families and to design a village. When I got dino world I was even more pleased because you can go between the world's. I recommend for anyone of any age.
B002NLY0V4|5.0|very nice set. What can I say I love Supernatural. Amazon did have the best price on this set. I bought them on ebay first for only a couple bucks less and they were bootlegged and the case was coming apart with hot glue strings. Half the movies didn't work. I sent them back and opted for a more trusted resource. I don't recommend movies or CDs from untrusted resourses. So you're better off getting them here.
B000Q76K24|3.0|Simply put a man enters the CIA and embraces the culture.  The consuming nature of intelligence work impacts his relationships with his wife, his son, and his entire life.<br /><br />In reading other reviews after I watched the movie, I learned that it ran 2 hours and 40 minutes.  I was taken back and had no idea the movie ran so long since I was drawn in by acting, plot, etc.

B004FRX0MY|4.0|We've moved all of our music now to Amazon MP3, after trying it out for a couple of months. It works very well, and it's really nice to have our music available to different devices via the internet...and not to have the music taking up a lot of room on our computer. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't always recognize songs from obscure bands and sometimes gives us trouble uploading songs if it doesn't recognize it.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|This is a great wipe holder.  I just ordered another one for my Skip Hop Pronto Changer because the little plastic one in there stinks.  I've been using this for about five months now and I honestly haven't had any of the problems that other reviewers have written about.  I actually find that it keeps the wipes wet for much longer than cheaper plastic containers.  The red slider has never fallen off.  It isn't super slim, but it is certainly not as big as a wipes container... maybe the tiny \\"travel\\" size ones, but it's less than half the size of the refill containers I buy.  You do need two hands to open it, but I can't imagine any travel wipes container that you wouldn't have to do that.  It's much easier than other travel containers I've used because you can easily pull out just one wipe, and there's no danger of all the wipes falling out all over the floor of a restroom when you're just trying to get one out, which has happened to me with other containers (hence my purchase of a second one of these!).  I use the strap to attach it to a hook on the inside of my diaper bag so it's easy to find when I need it... I wouldn't hang it on the outside -- no need.  I used this for every diaper change on a 10-day trip to Paris and it was a breeze.  Love it.
0307719774|5.0|While looking at other books on Amazon.com, I came across this one and thought &#34;What a great thing to leave for my wife or daughter&#34;! The questions are pretty straight forward and the four lines to write on make you think and compose your response.
0385349831|3.0|After reading and loving Coelho's \\"The Alchemist\\" and \\"Warrior of the Light,\\" several years ago, I had certain expectations for his new book, \\"Manuscript Found in Accra.\\" I expected to either learn, or revisit, wise ways to face and work my way through a variety of situations, including difficult ones. I expected to feel refreshed and energized, the sparkle back in my eye. I set my expectations too high, yet I wasn't about to let myself be disappointed. I did find some good stuff in here - I just had to hunt and insist on finding it!<br /><br />\\"Manuscript\\" has some words of wisdom in it, but I really had to dig to find the rare original thought or fresh way of expressing an idea. I don't mind hearing something I've heard before, but I was hoping for a bit more sparkle and originality: Some chapters felt garbled, jumbled, run on - and I didn't like them. I also didn't care for the lack of a story - each chapter deals with a different question and answers, but there's only a hint of a story tying together all the advice and words of wisdom. Copt, the man giving the advice, and the people facing a battle in Jerusalem, were not developed, had no personality, didn't feel like more than someone asking and answering questions in an advice column in a newspaper or magazine.<br /><br />That said, there are still words woven in wonderful ways that made me pause and think, even if for just a moment or two, and this is why I picked up the book in the first place. One of my favorite thoughts involved how people who don't believe in their own beauty try to imitate others in order to entice love to come to them, while love isn't looking for that imitation, but for originality. Another idea I liked was the one that said there are no winners or losers (in the cycle of death and resurrection), only stages to be gone through.<br /><br />It helped to put the book down frequently and return later - it's not something I could stand to read for more than a chapter or two. If you're willing to read a sometimes repetitive (meaning things you've heard before, told in a way you've heard many times), story-less advice book for the bits and pieces you might find worthwhile, I'm sure you'll find SOMETHING that will cheer, encourage, comfort or guide you.ng to read a sometimes repetitive (meaning things you've heard before, told in a way you've heard many times), story-less advice book for the bits and pieces you might find worthwhile, I'm sure you'll find SOMETHING that will cheer, encourage, comfort or guide you.

0345803485|3.0|This book is readable, but as a grown woman I find it immature and extremely predictable.  I wondered what all the fuss was about but realized early on that it's a lot of hype.  Young women would really like it....wish it had been around when I was in my 20's!  :)

B000FC11JW|5.0|What I loved about this book is the fact that it forced me to think differently about how I see effectiveness, making a difference, and building careers/companies. This is the type of book you read every year for a decade and every time learn something new. Buy it read it share it embrace it. I am, at 24, now a total fanboy of this book.

B000W1VDEY|3.0|Wow. I can honestly say that back when I was in high school and this album was new, this canon blew me away!  It was nice to hear a singer other than Robert Plant sing in this range, and the band - while aping Led Zeppelin to a certain degree - really stands out as totally unique.  John Rutsey was one of my favorite drummers back then.  Still is.  Love Peart, of course, but Rutsey steamrolls \\"Finding My Way\\" and \\"Working Man.\\"  My faves are \\"Before and After\\" and \\"Here Again.\\"  If you're into 1970s rock, classic rock, power trios, jam bands, or anything of this sort, make sure you don't ignore Rush's 1st album.  I didn't think their next 2 lived up to it - although I'm with you all on the rest of the classics in the catalogue.

B0034CNSFU|4.0|Wish this album had a few more tracks.  Some of the album cuts are amongst my favorite Jimi tunes.  But, if you're looking for the radio hits and the cream of the crop, you can't go wrong with this.  I'd probably recommend the first album first, then the second, then the third, then the fourth.  But go ahead and give this to anyone who needs a nice collection of any kind of music, as it's all covered here.  Nice sound quality also.  I remember my old \\"Smash Hits\\" on 8-track and it sounded terrible.  These tracks are clean, smooth, and pristine.

B002PJN59M|3.0|its cool and weird and not all that great but still a good watch and a medieval movie that actually looks medieval, awesomely

B005ZCXPP0|5.0|This movie is an American as Apple Pie.  Chris Evans does a wonderful job from beginning to end with his honesty and strength from inside himself of wanting to fight for his country.<br /><br />Movie takes place during 1941 WWII, seeing Chris Evans as a scrony young man until he meets up with Dr. Erskine [Stanley Tucci] letting him know he can make a difference and help contribute to the worldwide struggle against the Nazis.<br />So with Dr. Erskine and Peggy at Steve's side he turns into our all American Superhero 'Captain America'.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie for all ages, I love the innuendo's throughout the movie, the scenery and the continued comic book style from the thoughts of Stan Lee.  I especially love the ending as it brings a new curve to the next movie. Great ending.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|If you are a Tarintino fan then this is the movie for you. It was one of my favorite of his movies, rigth there with Pulp Fiction
B005H9B44A|5.0|You never really know, even in real life what you would be capable of if you lost one of your most precious 'powers'.<br />Stan Lee's Marvel Comics story of Thor being with his father and brother [adopted we find out later] show's us how even today that families will argue, disagree, make mistakes and then try to fix them [even in the God world].<br /><br />The characters are wonderful, a great story and we learn so much from Thor as he learns from us 'Humans'.<br />Solid sense of humanity, fun, pure comic book theme, loved learning about Thor before the Marvel's Avengers came out.<br /><br />I would recommend for all ages, there are some cute moments of romance, fighting, and justice and Thor would be a great Hero to any child who seeks Justice and to have some strength in not only his hammer, but his brain.
B006UIUJ2A|1.0|Some parts of the world are ignorant enough about the DPRK (North Korea)to think this is a true reflection of it.<br />Yes I know it is a novel but dehumanizing the people of a country just doesn't do it for me.
B001LM1456|5.0|I grew up with Dr. David Banner [Bill Bixby] and the Hulk [Lou Ferrigno]. The mild manner scientist with an experiment gone wrong, and trying to find an antidote before he changed into a mysterious superhuman of strength. His theme of telling people that they wouldn't like it if he got angry [the warning].<br /><br />Watching this new Marvel Comics updated version with edward Norton and Liv Taylor, gave me chills. It was wonderful to see more of the personal aspects and watching how love and hate can be a fine line.  Great movie, well done, transformation of Dr. to Superhero is well done and would like to see this film continue on it's own.<br /><br />Love the fact that at the end there is a signal that something greater is coming. Good ending on that note.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Great item but make sure to follow directions or end up messing up your materials or yourself.  Awesome investment, glad I got it.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Watching this movie, Robert Downey Jr does impressive work. Getting to know the character [this is definitely aparent by taking us through all the processes of his mind].<br /><br />Very strong movie, some violent parts, but works to help the watcher understand the perils of war and how something you created for good has been placed in the hands of violent people and used for mass destruction.  A revelation for the Character to become the superhero 'Iron Man'.  Again, hats off to Stan Lee for writing this comic book character, he's everyone's dream.<br /><br />The transformation of a regular guy [type: rich, business,  strong, etc] to using his itelligence to create a character that we cheer for and the kids want to become. A doer of 'Good' and always wins in the end.<br /><br />Great for all ages. Definitely recommend.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am enjoying it so far I do like however how in depth they explain how to manuver I hope it remains this good!!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I started reading after I started watching the series, but it's so much better! I am really understanding the characters more and what's going on. I total recommend reading the books if you haven't!
B009AMANBA|1.0|It would have been so much better to use an unknown actor with Lincoln's overpowering height, presence and facial characteristics for this significant portrayal. Mr. Lewis (great in Gangs of New York) did not work for us in this role. He seemed unnatural and not believable as Lincoln. My husband and I also did not like the way the film was shot so dark as though the sun never shown. Nor did we think the overall portrayal of this man was entirely honest. He was a President we learned to love growing up as a man who worked tirelessy to free the slaves and whose many witticisms and simple common sense statements live to this day in the hearts of this country's God loving people. This film seems to be a liberal spin on the greatest President this country has ever known. In it Lincoln was made out to be a liar and someone who subverted the constitution to get his way; a lot of liberal Hollywood hyperbole. And, no action in this film; lots of back room political folderol and suppositions introduced by the writers in Hollywood. A bit claustrophobic to watch.

B007R41E8O|4.0|This game is very well done. I enjoy HO games that have a good story. I would give it 5 stars, if it didn't restart when I solve the puzzles. This happened on all puzzles in the mansion - and not just once, but several times. The astrology puzzle I could not solve, because the tiles would not move. Other than that it is a nice game
B00866H7SS|5.0|This book was better than 50 shades of grey, looking forward to the 3rd book to be released. The way it was written was more mature writing than fifty shades of grey.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Modern Vampires of the City is easily my favorite of Vampire Weekend's three albums. They've successfully retained their central ethos of splashy world-inspired rhythms, but on Modern Vampires, Ezra and the boys have added polish and introspection that wasn't present on their debut album or Contra. This is a really fantastic album.

B00127RAJY|4.0|Purchased this a few months ago and it definitely was everything we expected from Jillian Michaels.  My husband and I aren't in horrible shape, but this is an intense workout.  If you can stick with it everyday, you'll definitely see and feel the difference.  So far, we've only been able to do about 7 days in a row because of our busy schedules. It's hard to commit to working out everyday and we prefer working out every other day for longer than 20 minutes.  We've been incorporating this video's routines into our every other day along with jogs or long walks.

B00AF46Q5Y|4.0|As a first time Jeffrey Archer reader and fellow author, I really admired his writing style to a point. I did feel that there were some places where he milked out a particular scene a bit too long. However, for the most part, I truly loved the twists, turns and characters he drew so vividly. The varied locations and storylines intertwined with action taking place in/around WWII making it even more interesting. Mr. Archer's knowledge and research on his subject matter is evident. I was disappointed that there was no satisfying conclusion and that I'd have to buy the next in the series to find out what happens between Harry, Emma and Giles. But overall a very solid read.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love this entire series, it is one of the best I have ever seen and it has enough episodes to make me watch it for a month.

B0029LCJJS|5.0|I love this show! Captures behind the scenes moments left out of history books. Not 100% accurate but does reflect the characters & times well. I have enjoyed the history conversations my husband & I have had with this show.  Shows both sides of the reformation argument which was played out well in the uprising in the north prior to Cromwell's execution. Surprised  with sudden change of actresses for Jane Seymour. Loved how its the fool who jelps Henry while he's mourning. Warning: there's a bit of skin in this show but it's Henry VIII ! Mature audiences only. Curl up with a couple of drinks with your man & enjoy this one ladies!

B00CD4RPWM|2.0|The Exile was a disappointment to me.  I didn't like the way it was displayed on my Kindle. I have an older version of the Kindle so I was unable to rotate the screen to see more of the illustration. Plus no one else can picture the way I perceive Jamie and Claire.<br />This is not something I would recommend. Also, the price was too high!
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is the only version of Emma that I have watched.  So I can't compare it to the other Emma which stars Gwyneth Paltrow.  However I loved the two main characters in it.  \\"Emma\\" is a rather sweet and kind girl who has ore conceived ideas what live should be and behind match making her friends.  However, her abilities and assumptions aren't always correct.  This was entertaining even enough for my 10 year old daughter.

B00915G6WQ|5.0|DEXTER's seventh season may be considered the season of mistakes of which Dex certainly makes; the season of revelations; the season of female adversaries in conflict with our serial killing hero.  After a somewhat disappointing 6th season, the writers pull out all the stops in a sometimes hard to believe plot twists script.  But in spite of its weaknesses, I found myself riveted and involved and glad I wait on the DVD to avoid waiting week to week.  I watched all 12 episodes in three nights!<br />It's well known that Season 8 is the last so its direction can pretty much go anywhere.  The acting is generally flawless---Michael C. Hall is brilliant in his gradual progression to an even more sinister character.  Are the writers preparing us to see Dexter in a darker light?  Jennifer Carpenter acts up a storm as Deb faces an inconceivable truth about her brother.  The remaining regular cast especially David Zayas, Lauren Valez and CS Lee are great.  Desmond Harrington and his Quinn foul-up Quinn have become tiresome and superfluous.<br />Yvonne Strahovski as the deadly Hannah is remarkably effective, possibly more frightening soulmate for Dexter.  Ray Stevenson brings a cruel detachment as Izaak and Jason Gedrick seems to relish his role as heartless George. Dexter's runinations with Daddy James Remar are becoming redundant as well.<br />I have enjoyed the ride with the Dark Passenger but I agree with the decision to go out while the series is still strong.  And how about that dynamite season 7 finale!!!!
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|Decided to go ahead and record an album without publicizing that he was doing so. And then surprise, the album came out. With an awesome single with an awesome music video with me questioning whether or not David Bowie looks more femminine than Tilda Swinton. But Allow me to sum up this album in five words. &#34;Shut up, take my money,&#34;
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I decided to rewrite my review after some time passed. Reason? I wrote down my solid disappointment right after I decided to discontinue my read. I had bought the second and third installments and I blindly deleted it, wasting my hard earned money. I don't regret deleting them but I hate doing it anyways.<br />I am still wondering why this romance became a besteller, also why people write such raving reviews about it. I wonder wether my standards are just too high or wether other people's are too low.<br /><br />*Topic*<br />I am not opposed to the contents, though in my limited experience, bondage and domination are misrepresented. The way his \\"pain\\" and \\"abuse\\" are the so-called reasons for his need to control his heart and and his love life are too close to the will to hurt and abuse, in my taste. Yes I get the love story of the innocent, kindly woman taming the tall dark and strange brute, making him singsong to her heart but lets be honest, buy any BOUQUET, CANDLELIGHT or other romance novel and you will find the same storyline. Honestly the dialogue, the so-called battle of wills, the submitting... if it weren't for the severe sexual context, it would be childish and mindless. This does not feel like a blossoming romance between adults, but rather between teens discovering the balance of a relationship and their sexual presets.<br /><br />*Characters*<br />Christian is your basic run of the mill sexy, hot, gorgeous millionaire. How boring. He is the good doer with the black past and the hurt heart. Richard Gere \\"becoming\\" in Pretty Woman. He acts all controlled and dynamic at the same time, yet fails to recognize the least bit of basic emotions. Anna is supposed to be this young innocent girl, a \\"virgin\\". Ring any bells? damsel swooped from her feet by the amazing black prince on the black horse... Both characters are stationary, refuse to grow and are so basic and standard it's above and beyond impossible to believe yourself to be either one. The essence of reading (in my humble opinion) is to be able to step into the story yourself, feel and live it as would the characters. Enjoy the ups with them and cry when they are down. Root them on and warn them. Nothing of the like in this book. Both main characters are your standard fairy tale characters whom have no depth, no dimensions, no actual real life experience.<br /><br />*Writing*<br />The grammar was bad. The sentences short and standard. I was reading on that level in my fourth year of secondary school in English (let it be said that I'm dutch speaking) The contents repetitive. Flush against him and rolling eyes are what actually dominate this book. The sex scenes too ample, too present and never vary really. Yes other tools are used, yes \\"new\\" discoveries are done, but the way it is told and explained makes it boring and predictable. It almost always starts out the same and almost always ends the same. The story between the sex scenes is told in an almost childish and patronizing manner. The author shows no imagination when it comes to synonyms or sentence structures.<br /><br />I bet you are wondering why overanalyse this when all this story is supposed to do is make you escape from reality, dream and fantasize? Simple when all these things poke your eyes out, the intended escape from reality cannot be achieved. I think I read about two to three books a week, crime, fantasy and romance. (well except when dealing with the mammoth stories like the wheel of time or a song of fire and ice) I also think I have a pretty good grasp on how a story should feel, on how it should effect you and what it should sound like. I can't write, I have no patience for it and quite frankly I lack the innovation and talent but I do feel, as I've waisted my money on these books, that I have a say in it. Each has his own tastes, I get that, but I can't for the life of me understand why this series of all the good and talent authors out there, has bombarded this mediocre and stale author to the bestselling authors list.o the bestselling authors list.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Good Game.  Nice and fast paced. Would recomend.  My son also likes to play it.  A lot like crystal quest
B000FBJF3M|2.0|it was hard to relate to characters and the history was interesting but too trite or everyday ... just seemed to miss on both those fronts that could have really engaged?
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Very well acted and wonderful story. I have always loved the story, went to NY to watch the play and was not disappointed with the movie.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun little game. Graphics are great.  Like all the familiar Finding Nemo characters.<br />It's a little too slow at times but enjoyable all the samw.
0307352153|5.0|As an extravert in a family of introverts this is a must read.  Also the introverts in my family are enjoying the perspective.  Always nice to know that even if the world isn't geared toward people like you it doesn't mean that there's anything &#34;wrong&#34; with you.  The differences of extroverts and introverts bring more to the table.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This movie was only a little entertaining and also a bit hard to follow. There are some good moments of tension and excitement, but at other times it is just boring and even confusing at times. If I could go back in time I wouldn't pay money to rent this movie, only if it was free with my amazon prime membership.
B0053KWDES|1.0|Worked fine then the battery stopped charging after a month. You also cant charge and use it at the same time. Big let down.
B001E45XT4|4.0|i got this headset for 25$ a while ago, its awesome but i dont think its worth what it cost now
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great free app and weather reports are very accurate. You can track multiple places. I love the layout and can't imagine the paid version being much better.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|SUPER SCARY GAME. I'M NOT KIDDING. THAT'S WHY I'M TYPING IN CAPS! HE POPS OUT OF NO WHERE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET OVER 5 PAGES!!!!! I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO GET THIS GAME. IT IS BETTER THAN THE REST OF THE SLENDER MAN GAMES IN THE MARKET. THIS GAME IS PERFECT FOR EVERYONE EXCEPT  FOR BABY'S.<br />IN CONCLUSION THEY S GAME IS FABULOUS. BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like the reactive levels. Please add water/mud,  and holes to jump/ fall in..  Great job so fare..  Keep it up.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I loved it!<br />have not played in decades brought me back to the good old days<br />easy to play<br />would recommend it to everyone
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|fun to play. i want more games to play. free would be nice. angry birds are my favorite new friends!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|cell phone broke so it was the perfect back up<br />easy to use<br />very convienent<br />will recommendend it to others
0007431783|5.0|I love the photos of the house and all the characters. I am a real fan of Downton and especially like Matthew. I am sorry he was killed in the show!
B001LM1456|4.0|I really like this Hulk. But I'm going to talk more of the quality of the movie on amazon. It was really good. A lot better than Netflix and Vudu.
B0071AKB38|5.0|this is one of four different portable speakers ive tried, and this one is definitely the best. bluetooth is easy, and works perfectly. sound is great, bass is impressive. good high volume. portability is the best you can get for anything that puts out tunes like this. battery time is great. just a great piece of tech.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|And so the Saga begins... this very much anticipated movie, was not a let down in any way, other than it had to have an ending...
B00A8307BG|4.0|Clasic Trower playing some great songs. If you get a chance to see this band live take it you will not be disappointed
B00AHDXTIK|4.0|This cable works well and fits fine. Only downside is that it is terribly stiff. The cord is extremely thick and doesn't like to move all that much. Other than that, good product.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, however you must understand Quentin Tarantino work and I like his movies! Now they could have left out the rap song and used something different, either way, I am looking forward to his next movie.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|We loved the movie and would have given it fifteen stars if we could have. We enjoy all of Nicholas Sparks' books and movies.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  While there are some horror elements in it, it also feels sort of like a fairy tale.  Watch it!
B00CL68BK2|4.0|A view into the world of mental illness, and how medication can help someone put their life back together. There can be a silver lining.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Boring.  Maybe history buffs would like this movie, if, in fact, the issues debated are real.  One scene describing the authority of the president vs state law regarding slaves as property was an interesting legal question but I did not finish the movie....too much dialog and no action.
B005PK57IK|2.0|But I was only able to view the first episode and couldn't download others.  Didn't know what was up with that.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I love this director and Pan's Labyrinth is one of my favorite movies. I missed Mama in theaters and have been anxiously awaiting its release ever since. There were a few things that kept me from giving this the full five stars, however. The little girls were great, especially the younger one who was totally convincing as a sort of feral child. The uncle who searched for them and ultimately tried to adopt them was either a bad cast or the character was really poorly developed. Whatever the case, it seemed like he was just taking up space; interesting departure for Jessica Chastain as the goth girlfriend. Additionally, I found it difficult to follow much of the action because the movie was so dark--not just the story line (which is VERY dark) but dark as in hard to see. I realize this was done to set a particular mood but it was extraordinarily hard to make out much of what was happening.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it if you like this horror/suspense genre.
B0097K21YW|3.0|I had problems with some of the angles early in the game. Not sure if it is because I am playing on a 7&#34; tablet. Some items were impossible to hit to burn down.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I bought the DVD as a gift to my grandchildren. They told me it's great and are very happy I bought it for them.
1878424319|5.0|I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it I love it, I love it  I love the book and will share it with many friends.  Thank you very much
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Image and audio were both clear. Just wish that there could be 2 free episodes... maybe as reward for member purchase..?!
1603429999|5.0|As I have been knitting for years I required a pattern variation to knit a larger garment in the round.<br />This book has helped me to understand and to try out some of its techniques, with good results.<br />As originally I taught myself how to knit by a book.  I had no-one to show me how.<br />I still have that original knitting book after 35-40 years. I'm sure I will treasure this addition,<br />just as much.
B000002KLZ|5.0|Just got this CD yesterday and made the mistake of listening to it while I was driving. \\"Oh Well\\" came on and WOW!!! I had a hard time driving 55! Nice treat adding a Peter Green song into this CD.<br /><br />I never get tired of listening to \\"I'm So Afraid.\\" Lindsey was going through a really rough time when he wrote this song and I can feel his pain in every cord and he makes his guitar cry for him every time. I've heard Stevie sing \\"Landslide\\" so many times...but never like on this live CD set. It gave me the chills and her voice is like velvet, it's such a soulful version. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the way she sings Rhiannon on this live CD. I just recently purchased the new Rumors 3 CD set and she ROCKS Rhiannon on disc 2, the live World Tour. I couldn't stop listening to it. It's equally as good on this CD. She also takes her song \\"Sarah\\" to another level on this CD. Just Exquisite!<br /><br />Christine's voice is so pristine here. She never disappoints. Mick Fleetwood and John McVie's talent is so undeniable and you really get to appreciate Mick's drums on this CD. The sound quality is superb!! Don't even hesitate to buy this CD.<br /><br />Fleetwood Mac is collectively among the most talented groups of the 70's that remain just as powerful today as they were then. Their music is timeless and still exciting. That is quite an accomplishment!<br /><br />Mick, you always end the night with \\"The Mac is back,\\" as far as I'm concerned Fleetwood Mac never leaves! Even when they aren't touring they still move us. Can't wait to see them @ Jones Beach next month!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|It's ok I guess but just shooting birds into walls of wood, stone or otherwise other materials just seems rather like a waste of time than real enjoyment. I could see how a kid would really enjoy this and if you had nothing better to spend you time on it would be pretty fun, trying to achieve glory.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It touched us when it began and it grabbed us when it was over.<br /><br />They say 6 more words required.
B00CDCIQX6|1.0|The most boring movie I've seen.it jumps from one plot to another and it doesn't really have a reasoning. SUcks
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is verrrrrrrryyyyyyyy AWESOME but I think that it should let you  change your skin and if you make a crafting table in creative you could use it...
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love waking up to MY choice of music instead of a bone rattling, obnoxious sound. Dependable, and extra easy to set or change alarms.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. My friends and I always play together. I love the survival mode it's awesome!!! It was worth the money BIG TIME!! You should totally buy this game.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|A creative and original show that is family friendly and great at any age. One of the few out there today.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I like how it made you think more so if you are a puzzle kind of person I would suggest this game
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Great show for the older audience, yet still clean and lots of emotion to carry the story lines. Well done
0345525558|4.0|I bought this because it was the choice of one of my book clubs, although I had picked it up, glanced through it, and decided against it in the bookstore.  The reviews that say that the young woman protagonist will drive you crazy are correct.  She's one of those &#34;her own worst enemy&#34; characters, but I think the author is challenging you to try to understand WHY.  She's an 18 year old who has just 'aged out' of the foster care system, and she's never really connected with anyone permanently.  Her life-changing redeeming quality is a love of flowers, and in particular, the meanings of flowers.  Trusting no one, she keeps at arm's length even those who reach out to help her, to her detriment.  You'll root for her, and want to smack her upside the head, all at once.  The club agreed it was a good read, although a couple of folks just 'didn't like her!&#34;  Yeah, I can see that.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Much has been said about Black Swan on line. I think the acting is outstanding. I would keep this dvd away from children at all cost; however, I think that Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis have well earned the plaudits they received.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|Works very nicely the only thing is you have to pay attention to the formats of music it will play....threw me at first because, I don't feel, they are readily apparent. But I like this program for it organizational and utilitarian functions.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|This is the best CD by One Republic yet. Each record they release gets better and better.  Simply Awesome. Thanks.
B00CSWBE8K|5.0|A great album by an under-appreciated artist.  If \\"Queen of Denmark\\" was an album about denial, sadness and grief at the collapse of a once promising relationship, then \\"Pale Green Ghosts\\" has fully moved into the anger stage.  It's an album of bitter recriminations and self-lacerating observations backed by fairly stark arrangements and techno beats.  It's not as immediately accessible as Queen of Denmark and many of the songs don't fully reveal themselves until after several listenings (such as Vietnam and Glacier).  Still, this is an album I highly recommend.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|I have always loved this movie and I rarely watch any kind of tv or movies.  When I seen I could watch it on my kindle I took advantage of it on some down time.
B000000OU4|5.0|would love to hear more of this type of &#34;smooth jazz&#34; e.g. tracks 1-4, 6, 7 from pat metheny sometime in the future
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fireproof games 1st effort is a marvel. Incredible graphics and gameplay. The most difficult yet thoroughly satisfying game of it's kind. Buy this game, you will not regret it! Can't wait for the sequel!!!
B000NY12LO|4.0|Jodi Picoult is a great writer.  However, this story is about bullying in school and certainly nothing about this subject matter is uplifting.  If you want a book with happy ending, don't read this one.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I submitted a review saying I will never watch another movie made by the wachowski brothers and Amazon must've thought it was not appropriate.  This movie is terrible and it is SICK.  Save 3 hours of your life and spend it doing something more productive.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|Did not think I would ever get to the end of this book. Was bored by it. But felt I should read it since  I paid good money for it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I liked it.  Like the book better. Then again I usually enjoy the books more than the movies. Overall good, enjoyed the settings in the movie.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I grew up with star trek and still love it. Enterprise answers the questions about where and how it all began.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|The stories are engaging, with sontimes humorous elements. I like that they stick to the Western genre, even though it's a futuristic show set in space. Star Wars just flirted with that, but Firefly sticks with it successfully. Great cast, too!
B00C0QOZP8|4.0|I was hoping this album would have more songs like Last of the Real and Gone Sovereign but album was not quite as heavy.Part 1 set the bar pretty high. Lyrics are still great along with awesome vocals. I would recommend it.
1452110581|5.0|This little book kept me giggling all the way through.  My next kitty will be named Francesco in honour of the author!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I really like the action in this game, it is so fun, can't stop playing it. Action, action, action packed.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Multiple movies in one that all have a connection, like we've seen in movies like Oscar winner \\"Crash\\".  Just this has more sci-fi and Eastern religious themes. If you don't recognize this from the beginning you might get lost like some movie critiques who gave it a bad review. The movie(s) eventually explains itself.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I can be on my own and do what I want because it is awesome! you have to try it!
B000NY12LO|5.0|Picoult does a masterful job of framing the conflicting paths traveled by those whose lives intersect in a tragic school shooting.
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|-The plot and most of the action scenes have been used so many times before that they become tiring.<br /><br />- There is no suspense.<br />- The acting is bland.<br /><br />I prefer Die Hard II and I.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, its production Budget was $92 million.  Its domestic gross was $67,330,689. So, it was a big flop in North America. However, its foreign gross was $237,377,139. Surprisingly, it was popular overseas.
B00AEFXWF6|5.0|I saw the movie in the theatre and when I read the blu-ray review I had to pick it up. What could be better with two great actors, great action, and drama it Face/off has it all! Highly recomended!
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|The best thing about this game has always been the multiplayer and it sucks that I can't get my online account data in my kindle. I've been playing the game online for a while in another device and I tought that it would be nice to get it in my kindle and now I have to start from the beginning in the online multiplayer. I was really hoping to play with the same exact account status in my online user like on NOVA 3. Please fix this and make things better and fair.<br />ALLOW CTOSS PLATFORM MULTIPLAYER AND ONLINE ACCOUNT DATA TRANSFER.
B004SDEP38|5.0|This is a great app.  It is compatible with MS Word, Excel.  I use it all the time.<br />I have the app on my kindle and cell phone. One suggestion I have is charge $15 one time and be able to download the app onto multiple devices. It cost me $30 to download onto my 2 devices.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|I was pretty excited for this book and very disappointed, as I felt like every other Diary of a Wimpy Kid book was five times better. 2 stars.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|I can not get it to recognize my HP printer. I tried but finally gave up and deleted the app.
B0059XTTW8|3.0|It is inevitable that this movie would be compared to the phenomenally well received 1980 version starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley. It does not make the grade on several points. It might be worth mentioning its successes first.<br /><br />Since this was made 35 years after the book was written, and perhaps 45 years after the period it describes, yet it was filmed in contemporary London, it was a challenge to evoke the early post-Cold War period. The design, camera, and music crafts accomplish this by giving the whole look and feel a \\"film noir\\" atmosphere, often in shadows. That worked; however it tended to exacerbate some of the film's problems. Gary Oldman was first rate, in an incredibly low key way. I would bet that he studied Guinness' acting in the part and tried to mimic that effect. One thing which helped is that Oldman is closer to the age of Le Carre's character as written in the novel, which works better with the scene with former Circus head of research Connie Sachs. John Hurt did well in the brief role of \\"Control\\", playing it with a lot more feeling than Alexander Knox in the TV series. Like all other characters, Benedict Cumberbatch's role is short and poorly filmed, but it comes off more believable than Michael Jayston's performance as Smiley's colleague, Peter Guillam.<br /><br />The biggest single negative mark compared to the TV series is that we are given no time to get to know these characters, especially since many are played by unfamiliar faces. The only actors I recognized aside from the three above are Colin Firth as Bill Hayden and Ciaran Hinds as Roy Bland. And for as good as both of those are, there was precious little time seeing them on screen to get a read on their personalities. In the TV series, you could instantly get a sense of their personalities in a delightful early slowly played scene. Part of the problem may be that there are precious few close-ups of characters' facial reactions. Half the time, it seems the camera is too far off to catch the good stuff. This is made worse by the darkness of most scenes.<br /><br />It is understandable that many scenes would be cut or abbreviated or presented in a different way, but the \\"abbreviation\\" seems choppy. Both this version and the TV version were true to Le Carre's plot style with multiple flashbacks. Whenever I get a far better understanding of a film on second viewing, I sense that far too much was left on the cutting room floor. When I started watching it for the first time, I felt so disjointed, that I stopped and watched the TV series again, so I could get a better handle on the plot and characters.<br /><br />My biggest feeling of loss was the fact that we get little good sense of major characters, and virtually no good sense of lesser characters. From the 41 roles in the TV series, characters with several major scenes are cut entirely, such as the delightful scene with Joss Ackland as Jerry Westerby and Sian Phillips as Smiley's wife, Ann. Treatment of some minor characters seems to be an afterthought, instead of the depth given in the TV version. Hopefully, without giving anything away, I think both the climax and the denouement were let downs.<br /><br />I think that if I had not seen the Alec Guinness version, I may have liked this better, but that's the name of the game when one evaluates artistic works. How do they stack up to similar works.oo far off to catch the good stuff.

B004LOMB2Q|2.0|It's an ok app.  I don't like using it so I deleted it from my ereader.  It's not what I wanted.
B003QSOE0U|5.0|I purchased the movie on Amazon as well but decided I also wanted to watch it right away so I streamed it! So easy to stream it live on my laptop! Love this feature!
B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|Its impossible to make a movie about the tsunami and include each and every facet of destruction and devastation.  This movie focuses on one happy foreign family on vacation visiting from Japan.<br /><br />The movie starts very slowly with hardly any dialogue, and at times is filmed as if with a hand held video camera.  Knowing this movie is about the tsunami you know it's not going to be happy for very long and without much wasted time the tsunami quickly hits.  The story continues, long and drawn out.  The movie is quiet, nothing but ruin as far as the eye can see.  Lotst of wasted time and fast forward moments.<br /><br />The movie picks up more when they finally get to the makeshift hospital scenes, but again, not a whole lot happens there either. You aren't provided with much back story, who the people are, or where these hospitals are located. You have no idea where all of the doctors, nurses, and volunteers came from.<br /><br />The wife is on deaths door one minute, goes into surgery and is on an airplane home the next.  No time frames are given.<br /><br />While there isn't much dialogue, there certainly isn't any bad language. There is however, scary moments of being swept away to sea, dead bodies, and open flesh wounds.  Gaping flesh wounds really.<br /><br />I certainly wasn't impressed with this movie.  I learned nothing more about the tsunami, the destruction, the death toll, the miracles, the hope, the survival, the rebuilding, the volunteers, etc.  It seemed more like it was thrown together in haste to be the first movie of its kind to air.  And then of course there were the instances of bad acting.<br /><br />I really wanted to like it, and be especially sensitive to the story subject matter, but I just didn't like it at all.  I would not recommend this one.  Do some research, and find a more accurate, perhaps historical documentary on the tsunami.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great concept and world, consistent, and well done. I read this book in one day, and it was just great.
B0019M2ITY|5.0|This watch looks good. I hope this works well too. I bought this as a b'day gift to my best buddy.
B005PK553C|4.0|Very creative with new takes on the horror premise. Was a tad disappointed in the season finale but there were plenty of twists and turns to keep me intrigued.
B008BM9L72|4.0|It was easy to read and kept you wanting to read to see if what you thought could happen would happen. Not the soft porn I was expecting to read. Quite tame. But fun.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Great book. I enjoyed it. Romance suspense and mystery all in one. I would recommend this book to anyone interested.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great game fun when your bored works great play it for hours and it won't get stale not one of games that is focused on time so more fun
0761169253|4.0|I love this book. It doesn't take itself to seriously.  It influences you to be free of the fear of copying artists and instead, be inspired by them, building on their ideas. I love how its written and enjoy its layout. A pocket book full of inspiration!
B008YKGQR4|4.0|good to look up Facebook  see wet is on it  and keep up on thing well I'm in a DR offers
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The story goes back and forth between the past and the present. It's very sad and depressing at times, but at least there is consolation at the end. It's hard to believe orphanages were really run that way! And not so very long ago. There are some great characters and overall I enjoyed the book and the more I read the more I got hooked on the story. I would definitely recommend it.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I'm playing it .  not in to the game right now so I not to mach to say about it
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|There is nothing wrong with the game itself...and I have a Facebook account, so that's not the issue...but, for me, angry birds is my go-to game for when I don't have wi-fi....so, it doesn't work for me at all.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A superbly written book that gives you a look inside the psyche of a Navy Seal sniper.  Brutally honest from both the authors side and an unexpected glance into his marriage which was provided in short sections written by his wife.  Well worth the read!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I am obsessed with WWII and love James Bond so when I came across this book I had to read it.  It took me a day to read, and I can't wait for more to come in the series.  Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond books, was a real-life war veteran and much of his writing is based on his adventures in WWII.  This book is based during the German occupation of Paris and does not disappoint when it comes to quick-moving action sequences and the intrigue of this era.  The author has clearly done his research as he incorporates what seem like true life anecdotes, and some of the book reads like a great history lesson. I highly recommend this as a book to sit by the pool with this summer!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is epic because it has a tank and other vehicles in the game and is a little challenging just the way I like it.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|My son who just turned 3 loves this!! It is the first app I have gotten that he really enjoys. He is now starting to count out loud a lot more during our days and i believe this app had something to do with it. I love this. It has levels for the difficulty so we have only went up to level 2 so far, but that doesn't matter because it keeps him interested.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I thought it was a decent movie. It followed the book mostly but had to skip some f the detail. Hopefully it will be vicited in the sequels
B00BDAP66E|5.0|This is great while on the road we can check on what is going with our business page. I can stay in contact even if I am on a long road trip where I usually wouldn't be able to.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|This is an addition to my original review (below).<br /><br />After viewing this film for a third time, I finally determined where the real fault lies in the story.  Merida (the princess) wants to change tradition (i.e., her marriage to the winner of a contest).  But the problem is, she does absolutely nothing to earn the RIGHT to challenge the tradition.  That is, Merida does not place her own personal safety at stake, nor does she redeem anyone by taking her position (e.g., by personally saving the soul of the ghost-bear prince).  If she had placed her own interests at risk, or accomplished something grand or noble by taking her position, then she would have earned the right to challenge tradition.  But ... she did nothing.  Rather, it was her mother (Elinor) who changed.  In short, the ostensible heroine of the story (i.e., Merida) did nothing meritorious - she was only \\"brave\\" in being a defiant child.  And what lesson does that teach?<br /><br />My original review:<br /><br />With over 2000 reviews written thus far, it's unlikely that anyone will read my review.  Notwithstanding, here I go.<br /><br />First of all, let me say that the animation is superb - what Pixar has done in the way of animating hair and water is simply amazing.  The forest scenes in the early part of the film are works of art.<br /><br />Now, to my major problems with the film.  Yes, I understand that the \\"moral\\" of the story is about being brave in choosing and pursuing your own destiny.  What I simply don't get is why the mother (Elinor) underwent such a radical change in personality (going over to accept her daughter's views) merely as a result of her transformation to a bear.  There was simply nothing in the mother's experience as a bear which would explain this transformation of personality.  Yes, there is the whole \\"fish\\" scene, and the \\"rescue from the evil bear\\" scene, but I just don't see why either experience should convince the mother that she was wrong in her views, and that her daughter (Merida) was right.  Plus, it does not seem that any lesson was learned by Merida, the ostensible heroine of the story (a major shortfall in story telling).  In fact, it seems to me that the story is more about the mother (Elinor), and what she learned as a result of her experiences.  But, as said, the story falls short to that end.  Plus, there is the whole confusing thread of \\"legends are lessons\\" - what lesson was learned by whom and as a result of the story told?  Merida did not save her mother - it was the mother who saved herself from the \\"evil bear\\".  So, in my opinion, not good story telling.<br /><br />John Lassiter (the father of Pixar) is on record as being a great admirer of the films of Hayao Miyazaki (as am I).  In Brave Lassiter attempts to create a \\"young heroine\\" story line, perhaps along the lines of Miyazaki's Spirited Away, or Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.  But Lassiter falls short in Brave.  That is, the ostensible heroine of Brave (i.e., Merida) does not place her own life at risk in order to save those whom she loves (or for a greater ideal).  In Brave, Merida's greatest contribution to the salvation of her mother is merely placing the stitched-together tapestry over her mother.  It was not Merida who saved the day, but rather her mother, Elinor.  So what lesson is to be learned from this film?  Nothing, so far as I can discern.  Merida (the daughter) did not \\"save the day\\", and Elinor (the mother) underwent a transformation in personality with no satisfactory explanation as to why that occurred.  In the end, a confusing story line as to what was learned by who, and why.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|This book is very profound and interesting, gave me insight like never before. Highly suggested, so glad I read it.
B0054E317Q|5.0|Chris once again comes through with wonderful music, accompanying many popular musicians and singers!  It lived up to my expectation and more.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|I liked this movie but it didn't feel like Star Trek. CG was fantastic and it has my personal favorite &#34;warp&#34; effect.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|Great movie in the tradition of Gone With the Wind. It is basically a love story. The actors are excellent as is expected.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love the game it help with idineffy skills of hidden objects that need to be found in a timely manor my son loves it too
630542828X|5.0|This movie was great , I was able to look at it more than one time and take it apart and give my<br />thought's as to what the case should be, I was acting like a lawyer, next to Mr Travolta, because some civil actions can be very<br />hard, and you have to dig way down deep to get all the facts. not just half truths .
B009JBZH54|5.0|All 3 movies on blu-ray in the Dark Knight trilogy with extra features? This was the perfect item for me, even though I already owned the first two movies on DVD. I bought this item for around $25 and am completely satisfied. A great gift for any Batman fan.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I was surprised that each tip provided different touch as I use different apps that require the stylus, which provided excellent touch and value.<br /><br />Joe
B008TMA1LY|3.0|My granddalughter loves this game, but we cannot figure how to get enough points to hire people.  There is not enough info on how to play the game.  A sample game would help.
B00328G4XY|5.0|Five Star rating.  One of Jimi's best Albums.  He was really stretching musically, exploring new directions.  There was a lot happening musically at this time in terms of the fusion of Jazz and Rock.  It would have been great to hear him push his music even further.
B0051E9JNE|4.0|It will inspire you to watch all three and regret the last two! Cult classic, Queen sound track, well worth the time even though it is a couple decades behind today's techy movies.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I've been hearing about Gary Clark Jr. for a few months now and I finally bought his CD.  One word &#34;awesome&#34;.  Great voice to go along with excellent gutiar playing.  I'm anxiously waiting his next CD.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Once you use it you can't do without it. There are new uses for Evernote being dreamed up every day.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This CD had a much more funky blues theme throughout.  I especially loved Gypsy Boy.  It was also good to hear the twist on Hear My Train a Coming.  The previous live recordings (woodstock, fillmore) were very heavy on the bass very funky.  On this CD Jimi carrys the tune with beautiful guitar work.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app is good for keeping copies of your travel reservations and info on your mobile device.  You can print to PDF and store them on the tablet, then pull them up when you're on the road.  Eliminates the clutter of printing paper.
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|Another excellent record from Matthew Houck, aka Phosphorescent. Wonderful songwriting, inspired playing, everything you'd want from this excellent artist. His albums seem to create what I would refer to as  &#34;Post-Americana&#34;, as it just seems to be a constant re-invention of what I thought was familiar, now new yet  still comfortable.
B008LG6SXS|5.0|I made a number of Bookings on my desktop.  This app gets me the same access.  I can make a new reservation, change, or cancel from the Kindle.  Very simple and easy to use.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Tiles are beautiful.  Games have appropriate level of difficulty, especially for beginners like myself.  Fun and good mental exercise for maintaining acuity and focus.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use AccuWeather all the time and love it. It is so easy to click on and check the weather for 15 day. I recommend this.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes to read whatsoever! I couldn't put this book down. What a heartwrenching beautifully written page turner! Oh how I wish I could find more books that touched me like this one has.
0060887966|5.0|The quality of the book was outstanding. It is the best book ever written. I have many copies and I always give copies to other people as gifits.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great for children and easy to play!  Kids from 8 to 13 will love this game and I like that its free!
B00CF2UORK|5.0|These are sooo clever,  REALLY CLEVER...... ENJOY THEM SOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!<br />Any age will enjoy these delightful characters....Shirley...Timmy...The FARMER!!! The Pigs!  Very well done..
B004SIIBGU|1.0|My bid total is zero, the auction items I'm selling is zero.  All I can do with this app is search for items.  Big deal.  I wanted something I could keep track of my auctions.  App is a waste of time unless you like &#34;zero&#34;.
B001XV09UG|3.0|It was an OK movie, but not one I would want to see again.  Story is not great, dialogue is not memorable.  Watching Cruise and Kidman is probably its only redeeming value...and it is not thier best.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Stephen King has been there, done that... It's a short story like we could've read 20 years ago.  I brings nothing new.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Many years ago I saw the movie of this book. Finally I have read the book, an I love it as much as I did the movie.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is by far the best keyboard app for Android! Now that they added swype, it's even better. Get this app Bx allow it to access your Gmail, twitter and Facebook account. Be sure not to allow it to post comments, just allow it access so it can customize the settings.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Another great book in the Hunger Games series. 2 things in this book have disappointed me and if you read all three books, I know you know what they are!!!!!!  Still another action packed story and can't wait for the 2nd and 3rd movies to come out. Thanks for the great story.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very addicting, I can't stop playing! Great graphics, soothing music! Just be careful to have parental control for your kids...Very easy to want to purchase in app!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is a book that will inspire and motivate you to live life by loving everything in it. It is the choices we make that determines who we choose to be.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can count on one hand all the thousands of books that I've read that I'd want to reread. This is one of them. Characters, to me, are the most important part of a book. If there is an emotional connection to a character, if I care about what happens to them, if I can relate to them in some way, that makes for a strong story. That Howey has created such characters and also put them in a story with a plot that drives them forward AND had done so in such a well edited book is nothing short of miraculous. I dare say this is destined to be a classic up there with Asimov's Foundation series. Yes, it's that good. Even if science fiction is not your preferred genre this will blow you away. Get it. Read it. Reread it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed the plot and wished that angle had been explored more in more detail.  Since I only skimmed over the explicit sex diatribe, I probably skipped 75 percent of the books.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Ok. A bit aggravating. Really can't see trains before they are on top of you. This rating process is ridiculous.
B000FA675C|4.0|It's a good book with a great start but moves a little slow but it speeds up fast and is a great read
B006KX3GXO|5.0|PicsArt really is an amazing app for all artists, photographers, or people who just love photoshop. I am very pleased with the app. It brings out the inner artist in you, and you have fun with it.
B00BN2NY48|4.0|The performances of Cirque du Soleil are visually stunning and this movie presents a collection of the best. There might not be much of a story holding it together but that's okay because it's really all about the performances and showmanship.
B000V6583C|4.0|How can you not like this?  It's Guns n Roses man!  Some of the most epic music ever.  Every American should own this album and their other albums as well.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Oh so cleverly composed with switch backs and I have read them all! One of his best. I highly recommend it.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|I bought this movie for one of my nieces for xmas and she loved it.  When I visited, I watched it with her and her father and it was pretty funny.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Im a huge Bond fan.  It relied on great action and a great story, not tech toys. Probally the best Bond since Thuderball.
B000V658NW|4.0|If you hate this, why do you hate America.  Stop listening to American music if you hate this, stop eating our fast food, stop drinking our beers, stop buying our products.  Honestly, how can you not like this classic.  This music is made from pure awesome.

B008M0UTRO|1.0|packaging looked perfect, but could not watch after seen 6.  tired on multiple dvd players.  the sound was strange, but this could have been an audio setting issue.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Got this fan to replace my aftermarket fan that started making noises when running and it has been a good replacement. Fan is silent and cools effectively. Perfect fit for my cooler heatsink.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I don't have a television set and found out about this show through a relative. It's been a long time since anything related to television has caught my attention. Great chemistry between characters, textures and lighting are beautifully done. Sherlock has a bit of Marlowe in him. I'll follow this show on Amazon.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I loved getting to see the characters grow as people and friends. So well written that I felt l like I truly knew them.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I am almost ashamed of how addicted I have become to this game.  But it is good clean fun. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|One of the best legal shows ever.  Great legal and personal situations.  Chicago venue makes for juicy legal adventures. Enjoy!
B007VDN1PA|4.0|The Scanner was easy to set up since I had read the previous reviews.  I powered it using my PC and a USB cable, so the short power cable was not a issue for me.  Once I got comfortable with the control buttons, I was ready to scan my slides.  In a matter of a few hours I had scanned 400 35mm slides.  The process was simple.  I scanned to a 4 GB SD card and then transferred them to my PC.  I used a photo program on the PC to enhance the photos so I can't comment about the image enhancement built into the Scanner. I also did not scan any negatives so I can't rate that ability either. I was very happy with the Slide scanning capabilities. For a low cost solution to see some 40 to 50 year old slides I would recommend this product. If you are looking for the quality of photos we get now with camera phones and digital cameras you will not get that from any 40 year old slide, but the walk down memory lane was great and most of the photos looked good with some enhancement.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|I was so sad when I completed the final level in this game.  NOTE TO GAME DEVELOPERS: I, and judging from the other reviews many other people as well, would LOVE and PAY for more levels for this game.  Fun, fun, fun!
B00001QEE5|4.0|Great video for my grandson and he really like it. An old movie that brings back a lot of fond memories of my childhood
B00COHAUD4|1.0|Really bummed as I love horror movies. This wasn't scary or fun or well written. The &#34;bad guy&#34; is completely CGI.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Fantastic movie and worth every penny.  My grandson says it is his favorite movie. Visual effects are the best ive ever seen
B003JTHXN6|5.0|I chose 5 stars because of the Core Values and the message carried throughout  this book.  It inspires , no matter how old we are, to achieve our &#34;happiness&#34; and Dreams.<br /><br />Great Book, and Great Company !  We are due for a change when it comes doing business  :D Tony is witty, funny and so personable.<br /><br />Would love to hear what his parents have to say about his &#34;culture&#34; and how they've impacted him at an early age.<br /><br />Isabelle
B000NI8F5G|5.0|I love this movie! I didn't want to spend a lot of money to show it to my class only once. Renting was a great way to go for me.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Enjoyable game. Good action, lots of weapons, challenging time constraints.  The weapons are historical and the graphics are very nice. Interface is also easy to use.
B005OSUKSA|5.0|David Garrett is a masterful, world class violinist.  He studied at Juilliard in New York under Isaac Perleman, after first picking up a violin at age 4!  Handsome, humorous, and versatile in classical, pop tunes, rock and crossover genres.  Born in Germany and has an American mother, he resides in New York and Berlin. His stage presence is awesome, and he has such a huge fan base in Europe, that it is hard to get him back to the U.S. as his last concerts here were in 2011. You'll love David's music, played on his beautiful antique Stradivarius, worth in the millions.

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Star Trek : Into Darkness<br /><br />\\"You are a pawn, Kirk. You can't even guarantee the safety of your own crew.\\"<br /><br />There's no denying 2013 is a good year to be a sci-fi fan. Offerings like Oblivion, After Earth, Pacific Rim, and Riddick all promise to keep fans of the genre quite happy. However, it's J.J. Abrams' sequel to his masterful 2009 Star Trek reboot that is arguably the most anticipated release of the year, and rightfully so.<br /><br />The 2009 film was an accomplishment; successfully modernizing the series while remaining decidedly true to what Star Trek is expected to be. Now, four years later, does the sequel, \\"Into Darkness\\" live up to its' predecessor?<br /><br />That all depends on what sort of film you want to see.<br /><br />If you're all in for an action-filled, gut-wrenching adventure featuring the cast and characters you love from the reboot, then this is the movie for you.<br /><br />The sound design is some of the best I've experienced in recent memory. From photon blasts to screeching metal to warp drives, it's unbelievably immersive. Jarring, subtle, soothing, adrenaline inducing, loud, it's what sound in a film like this should be.  Everything - even simple punches - have a weight and realness to them that is often overlooked in films.<br /><br />This beauty extends to the musical score as well. Haunting melodies and rising crescendos are superbly placed to manipulate the mood to exactly what the viewer needs to feel at the time, whether that be wonder, dread, or excitement.<br /><br />The returning cast members - from Pine to Urban to Quinto to Pegg to the superb Bruce Greenwood - are every bit what they were in Star Trek 2009, and have arguably improved in their roles.<br /><br />Quinto's Spock has noticeably grown, as has Urban's Bones McCoy. Pine's Kirk is a less explicit progression, but has successfully shaken some of the annoying frat-boy persona he exhibited in Trek 2009, which in itself is an accomplishment I can applaud.<br /><br />The new cast members serve their roles for the most part - minus Alice Eve, who seems perfectly content to act as a hollow shell placed in the film to be nothing but eye candy.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan, on the other hand, is a force to be reckoned with; Vastly superior to 1982's Khan - played by Ricardo Montalban, this new Khan is a sight to behold.<br /><br />Equally menacing and relatable, there were many instances in the film that I truly felt for him and thought he was justified in his villainous actions. Cumberbatch's brooding, emotional portrayal is one the better characters in the series history, and I can only hope he'll somehow be used again in the future. As engaging as he was, the final turn-about of his character arc was sadly predictable.<br /><br />That is where we come to the bulk of what is wrong with \\"Into Darkness\\"<br /><br />For all its victories, the film was almost too familiar for a returning fan like myself.<br /><br />It leans on its source material - 1982's aforementioned \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" - like an ugly crutch, all too often borrowing plot points and twists in unneeded ways.<br /><br />2009's reboot also did this, but in a far less greedy way, and ultimately managed to be original and surprising. \\"Into Darkness\\" does not succeed in this regard.<br /><br />While the story is serviceable; if you're an old fan, chances are you've seen a lot of it before. This means many of the scenes meant to evoke shock or suspense may ring hollow, because you already know the outcome.<br /><br /> On occasion, Abrams has an inspired stroke, and instead of lifting a plot point, turns it on its head and gives us a legitimate twist that we can appreciate, but too often he eschews this in favor of trying to play to our nostalgia.<br /><br />I was much more impressed with Oblivion's story line and unique ideas than I was with the script of \\"Into Darkness\\", which is rather sad. Star Trek has always been more of a thinking-man's sci-fi,but this new film falls squarely in the action/thriller department. If you're looking for a good thought-provoking romp through the future, I recommend Oblivion.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Into Darkness\\" is lacking in comparison to its older brother - and it seems to its competition this year as well. I will give credit to its final act, which was superbly engaging and had a pair of wonderfully executed twists - though they may be lost on newcomers to the series.<br /><br />The film is lots of fun, and if your introduction to the universe was the 2009 Trek, then you will likely be perfectly satisfied with this merely adequate sequel, but if you're a veteran of the world, you may be a tad disappointed.<br /><br />In closing, I cannot help but feel let down. Into Darkness was engaging while it lasted and had plenty of great moments. The humor was frequent enough that it prevented things from ever becoming too dark, while also keeping it's distance during the most dire of situations; and as previously stated the final act of the film was a superb ride.<br /><br />Yet, there are so many little things that while competent, were not astounding. So much potential literally brimming around the surface of the display, but never being fully realized. Does it deserve a place in your collection? Yes, though perhaps not on your \\"classics\\" shelf. \\"Into Darkness\\" will find itself much more comfortable alongside contemporaries like Prometheus or Terminator : Salvation.<br /><br />E. C. Cook 2013<br /><br />7.5/10

B002WV5A9G|5.0|The new cast is exceptional and the story was well written.  It is a movie that plays well for all audiences, except maybe the very young.

B00CATSONE|4.0|Interesting. JP Morgan was the Edison's investor during \\"currents war\\" and later who support Tesla's experiments without inmediate practical resuls. Even the books subject is related to imagination, it shows some links between Politics, Financial powers and genieus tenacity.

B00B7VPKMY|4.0|These CDs do not come in plastic jewel cases and there are no booklets. Which means no linear notes and such.<br />The discs come in paper sleeves, which I did not catch before I ordered, but of course now I see it noted all over the place.<br />Obviously, it's still a very good set. But if you like collecting albums and having the complete artwork and such, you're going to wanna buy them separately.

B0087GF8ZG|4.0|The motion light works great (sensor & brightness) better than expected. For potential buyers don't bother with the Velcro,  just use screws. Remember Velcro was invented for the space station - there's no gravity.  jfi
B00AZKCU7G|4.0|Wish we would of had movies like this in school ! Best film i have seen in a long time . Would recommend for any High School History class .
B00A2H9LK6|1.0|MOSTLY be aware of rental blurays. Now, that doesn't mean the disc was rented out, this means the cover art litterally reads \\"RENTAL\\" on the bottom and when you watch it, you are limited. You can only watch the movie, you cannot use any other features, even the deleted scenes or whatever else. GOHASTINGS, tried to pull a fast one with me.<br /> As far as the movie, i remember when i first played the video game on my playstation when it first came out. MAN, what a game. Then they came out with a movie, that within itself is a hype. Then they were comming out with a second one. Oh man, cannot wait. Anticipation ran too high for this movie, because it led to dissapointment. The movie was too fast paced, the only slow parts was when she was walking through hallways. They used some characters from the first movie, but NOT all the same actors. Thats the first fail, NEVER make a second movie and have different actors playing same characters. It worked with ROSE (Rhada Mitchell), but she didn't really have part in the movie, and in fact my opinion is what made the first movie great! Someone needs to RE-DO this movie, dissapointed all the way around. Not only you rushed through the movie, considering that she didn't recall anything, but yet is interacting like she knows what is going on. Things don't add up and on top of that, i never thought i would have something negative to say about silent hill.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|You should really get this app because it's a cool ( but creepy ) game to play. You first choose a bacteria, virus, bio weapon, or like five others and you put it in a country. After that it starts to spread and as it spreads you get points. Next it spreads to other country by land, sea, or air and you must evolve it with your DNA points. There are three ways to evolve it : how it gets to people, symptoms, and abilities. After you get everybody in the world sick, it says something like `people everywhere are dying in ditches` or `everyone knows they are watching the last of humanity` and after you win you get stuff like upgrades to your DNA BEFORE you play. I thank my Dad for getting me into this game.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Cliche, but this was a great film that deserved its accolades. Ben Affleck seems to have completely exorcized the demons of Gigli and comes back strong in an intensely interesting view of life in the often dangerous, always odd, clandestine services.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|One of the best apps you can get....a free dictionary!  I had an old hard copy around the house and a lot of the words from today are not in it.  This dictionary ROCKS!
B004PZ4HC8|2.0|I would have taken to the book more and enjoyed it more if it had been written in story form. The book is written as a series of interviews. Some are interesting, but most are drawn out and boring with too much military jargon. This is the first fiction book I've ever read with footnotes. I believe that this will be one of the very rare occasions where the movie may just be better than the book.
0763619612|5.0|Great to read to a class before beginning any art project!  Very freeing and brings out the artist in us all!
0891419063|5.0|I watched &#34;The Pacific&#34; group of shows that my son purchased and got interested in that portion of WWII. When I found out that this book was out there and that the reviews of it were as good as they were, I knew I had to read it. Once I got started I pretty much read it from cover to cover. Well written book. Recommended to those with and interest in history and do not want to read just a bunch of the same stuff or statistics.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Beautifully written. The chapters have a way of blending past and present in such an effortless way. I loved the story line.
B0000025BL|5.0|My brother had a copy of this on cassette many years ago and had been on and off looking for a copy he could listen to after a long day at work. I picked it up and surprised him at Christmas. He could not thank me enough. In his words, the best work Meatloaf has ever done!!<br />Recommended for the guys looking for a nostalgia trip.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|Classic of American cinema.  Great movie for kids and people of all ages with many life lessons.  My kids watched for their first time and came away cheering for Daniel and intermitently trying the \\"Crane Technique.\\" \\"If done right, no can defense.\\"
B0000057C5|5.0|I had listened to some of their stuff years ago and since that time I have been acquiring their albums one at a time. These guys just put the hammer down and do not let up. Recommended for any one who is tired of the same old &#34;my panties are too tight- please help me&#34; kind of music. Nothing like a little industrial rock to cheer you up before or after work.
B005ZMTYTQ|1.0|Bad quality, hard to hear and see. The movie itself has fairly dark quality, but this is not worth the money.
B000003RCY|5.0|I had listened to some of their stuff years ago and since that time I have been acquiring their albums one at a time. These guys just put the hammer down and do not let up.

B009OYTAL8|5.0|Best show on tv.  Everyone should try to watch it.  It is full of action, humor, and anything any TV viewer would love.
B007SGM084|5.0|I like the way the story flows.  It's hard to put down.  I didn't know you could put such things in writing for the General Public.  However, since I've read it several times, I really feel like I know the characters and want to be a part of their world.  The book is extraordinarily pleasing to me.  I highly recommend it to anyone under the age of 100.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I had been waiting for it for a long time, and wasn't disappointed. No spoilers...but the only advantage to waiting over a year was that I could watch the whole season at once. A bit expensive though...

B000HKYOK0|5.0|Star Trek fan and never disappointed when I watch it on my kindle and love the prime subscription- a must have if you have a kindle.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game it's awesome I love this game good lyrics too I wasn't expecting much but it came out way better than I thought it was going to be
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I got this game because of my favorite Youtuber, PewDiePie.  I watched him play through the whole game and just had to experience it myself.  This one, however, came with 5 other games, being the collector's edition, and while 3 of the other games were somewhat inadequate, the two games Flower and Flow were phenomenal.  Everyone should try playing at least Flower, because it was extremely beautiful; right up there with the beauty in Journey.
B007V4LBLU|5.0|IT TAKES YOU FOR A RIDE IN SMACK HEAVEN,,,THAN BRINGS YOU DOWN EASY...  TRY MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM.....FRANK SINATRA....
1400069289|4.0|An intriguing look at habits. The Power of Habit is well written and a pretty fast read. There are few items that seem inconsistent but in general Duhigg does a good job of overcoming this in the end. Some of the examples are over simplified and Duhigg does tackle this in the last section. Changing a habit is hard but it can be done.

B0063M22QO|5.0|I love playing this game. It is easy to play and its fun too. Something to pass time when I am bored.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|never the same game twice. lots of great game play. a super game and must have! very addictive and great graphics.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Game is ok could be better has alot more potential...i like the moon best...alot of tricks on the moon i dont like other maps
140015328X|5.0|I love the way Woz takes us through his childhood pranks, breaking minor telecommunications laws and worrying about whether the police were going to arrest him for his techy long distance phone cheating tool. He gives a no holds barred look at himself and its so hilarious that I laughed until my stomach hurt and tears leaked from my eyes. Since I was driving, I'm lucky this audiobook didn't cause an accident.<br />At one point, he details how he scrambled the TV broadcast during the old days of TV antennas on top of the set and only let it display correctly when someone's hand was placed in the middle of the screen. He let his fellow collegiates watch the end of the big sports game while one of them was holding his hand in the middle of the TV. If they've known, they'd have thrashed him. Woz was a bonefide bad kid, but he was as brilliant as he was bad. This story is a blast. I don't know that I learned much about technology, but I learned to really love Steve.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Twins are stranded by parental misbehavior and have to find their own ways in 1960s  Montana and Canada.  This turns out ot be a coming-of-age story for them in the end. I've always wanted to read something by Ford - now I want to read more.
B00CRS88IO|4.0|Damian Stevenson's, \\"The Ian Fleming Files: Armada\\" is a bit of a throwback to golden age serials and adventure stories when women were curvaceous and men drank scotch and smoked. Set in the early years of World War II, Armada does not waste any time plunging Naval intelligence officer Ian Fleming into action as he is tasked with securing the defection of a rogue French Admiral.  The Nazis want the Admiral's ships too so chaos ensues as Fleming battles the elements, double agents and SS henchmen.  This is a quick, entertaining read perfect for history buffs and spy enthusiasts alike.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I'm a little surprised at how much fun and how intense this game is, o don't regret the purchase at all so far. Of course, we're not terribly good at it yet, but that's half the chickens, right?
B00821OX98|5.0|Great tv series!!!! Must watch!!!!! Can't wait for june and season 3 to start!! Yeah boy! Who's ready I know im ready!!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Good acting...complicated story...you have to pay attention especially at the end....so you know who did what to who and why.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Ive waited months for amazon to add this game to the app store and now that they have ive been playing it for non stop its so addictive.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The series continues....the last episode in this season is the most beautifully written, filmed, edited, heart worming and heart wrenching episode I've ever seen of this series...and the entire series to date has been lovely.  I've watched all these episodes at least 5 times each and this last episode, when they go to Scotland...at least another dozen.  Just beautiful.
0451530977|4.0|Pirates, lost treasure, mutiny.<br /><br />Who has not been touched by Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island\\"...either in movie form or book?<br />Classic is such an overused word anymore, but this literary piece is still in high regard one hundred thirty years later.<br /><br />Jump on board with young Jim Hawkins and the list of characters...Billy Bones, Blind Pew, Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, Captain Smollet and of course Long John Silver in search of jewels, gold and fortune on a fictitious tropical island.<br />Cutthroat tricks and behavior lead to the demise of many involved but the quest goes on.<br /><br />Reason for not five stars? At times the piratical discourse can be somewhat tough to swallow...but this is how it was conveyed back in the day.<br />Enjoyable.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Loved the allusions to te original Star Trek - wish there was more of the &#34;utopian human future&#34; theme to the movie, like the tv series
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read all of the books.  I have seen all of the episodes of True Blood (summer of 2012 SUCKED).  I was very disappointed in the Deadlocked book.  So when Dead Ever After came out, I hoped that since this was the last book in the series, it would be better than Deadlocked.  I read it and couldn't put it down.  I am glad I didn't read the reviews on here before I bought the book because I would have missed out.  While others think it was rushed, I found it refreshing.  I found many of the other books dragged.  I guess I have a short attention span and like things to move along at a faster pace.  I loved the big reveal as to who was behind the attempt on Sookie's life.  I didn't see that coming.  I was disappointed in who she ended up with.  If I wouldn't watch True Blood, I probably wouldn't have been disappointed.  But I do watch True Blood so I wanted her with Alcide.  But even so, it was a sweet ending and I liked the book.  I admire Sookie's strength and determination.<br /><br />For CH, thank you so much for your dedication to this series.  I will miss it!  :-)
B009AMANBA|3.0|Too short a period in his life to get a feel for the person and his beliefs and contribution to American history
B003YUT1QM|4.0|Hard tone<br />IEEE that this movie is almost 20 years old. Just rented it for escapist fare. Funny to see the days when every characterdoes not have a cellphone.<br />For fun, escapist fare from not so long days of old, that seem older than it really is, this can't be beat.<br />Plus Sandra and Keanuae are both so cute and endearing.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|A brilliant series, visually dramatic, wonderful characters, violent, sexy but nonetheless captivating and a must watch series. Can't wait for th next series.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love this!!! This is a definite keeper! My kids love it too! Love the movies as well! Great graphics and awesome animations!! :0)
B005LAIIKI|4.0|this was a good movie i did like it. the western music added in made me think of the old westerns so that was nice but the rap music for me takes one star off. so 4 it is this year i have watched over 100 movies and this is in the top 15 movies for this year.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|The game is good but you need a lot of $ just to unlock the second vehicle and map this game is ok.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|itnis a good game. it should have an option to go back to stark industries. you should b able to just get a different suit with out having to do that.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|Exceptional. Very realistic.    Be advised: Lots of killing in a film about a real battle where many brave men - on both sides - were killed. Grueling and hard to watch at times, due to the sheer gruesomeness of the battle scenes.    This movie truly seems to capture the horror and utter chaos of this historic battle of the Viet Nam war. There is actually real film available from this battle, as well as the best-selling book, not to mention those brave men who were there and lived to tell about it. This film seems to be a reasonably faithful version of what really happened - at least from the American standpoint.    So, if you think this is just a valentine to the American military with little basis in fact, you are mistaken, as the VC are portrayed as courageous and competent fighters. Truth is stranger than fiction, and no make-believe Hollywood story has anything on We Were Soldiers. This fight really took place, with both sides taking extremely heavy losses.    Yes, it is quite gory, but certainly no less so than the actual battle must have been. With so many bullets and bombs flying around in such close quarters, it had to have been hell on earth.    These men were astoundingly brave and their story deserves to be told. Such amazing courage needs to be remembered, and such profound sacrifice should not be sugarcoated.    I honestly cannot fathom why any viewer would give this film less than three stars. Perhaps some people are just so opposed to violence in general, or the Viet Nam war in particular, that they dislike any film portraying our military in an even a vaguely honorable light. I personally feel the war was a waste, yet I still think the world of those men and women who were brave enough to go and fight it, not because they wanted to, but because they had to. To any and all remaining survivors of this battle, you have my utmost admiration.    A truly emotional film. A real story that every American interested in history should be made aware of.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is fun but the only way to advance at any speed is by spending money. there should also be a way to turn off status updates. very annoying. But this review earns me five card things ..... So there you go.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Well written, intriguing novel about a wife going missing and the husband is the prime suspect. This book is anything but the typical story of a missing wife....but I don't want to say anything that will spoil the book. It is a must read!
0345803507|4.0|This was a very interesting book. The story was good but a little far fetched but fun. I would keep it away from kids.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great read ! You could feel Ana`s every emotion as if it wad your own. Every woman should read this. I cannot wait to read the next book.
B0063M22QO|4.0|as a diversion, this game is a good one.<br />this is an efficient way to occupy yourself and its habit forming.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|This item came in perfect condition. Brand New. I recommend this movie. the graphics are A-mazing! love this movie! thank you so much :)
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|He was OK but his size still an issue<br />Certainly not 6'5 with hands like baseball mits<br />Did the best with what he had
B004VMUS9G|5.0|works like a charm especially for someone who needs multiple alarms to get their butt out of bed.  I use it as an app on my tablet.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I'd have to say that the ballads are may favorite songs due to the true emotion behind them but I also really like Without The Love and believe it could be a huge radio hit.<br /><br />DEMI seems to be going back to her old style... her younger style. Some songs has that young teen pop sound to them but they are still catchy after hearing them a couple times.<br /><br />There are many songs on this Album that will get stuck in your head for sure.<br /><br />So if you don't know who Demi Lovato is or aren't a fan, I'd still recommend this album even if you're a young adult. If you've been through hard times or overcome something then \\"Warrior\\" is your song. Have father issues? Then \\"Shouldn't Come Back\\" is your song. Lovato wrote \\"Nightingale\\" about a good friend of hers that died when they were 13 years old. Beautiful song. There are just so many really touching, beautiful, and relatable songs.<br /><br />The Target edition include a bonus song called \\"I Hate You, Don't Leave Me\\" which is amazing! If you have Borderline Personality Disorder you're especially going to be able to relate to this song! At least I think so.<br /><br />So Buy it!
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Once you get hooked on Michael Connelly you can't wait for his next book.<br />As usual this did not disappoint. I am looking forward to the next opne.

B000J103WK|1.0|When I tried to play this purchase on my DVD player, I immediately got a message that it was a defective DVD.  Very disappointing!!!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I found Christina McKenna to be a delightful Author. Look forward to hopefully more of her renderings of the wonderful character(s) she has wrought.<br /><br />You will laugh, cry, be saddened and your heart warmed when you read this wonderful tome.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|On the kindle fire the game is amazing. On my phone it lags to bad to play . The game over all is great.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A science fiction masterpiece, done very well due to the idea that a virus could actually create &#34;walking dead&#34; creatures that those uninfected must defeat
B009GX7IRA|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  Not a stupid, empty show like most TV shows.  Makes you think.  The chemistry among all individuals is terrific - as the NCIS group or the actors group.
B008I3RARW|5.0|Grandson and his friends love this.  Easy to use in both maneuvering, gas, brakes, backup and forward. I would recommend it for 5 and over.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|This is the ONLY show I watch in real time.  Everything else I watch after being DVR'd.  I would have a stroke if I found out my DVR messed up and I missed an episode.  As for season 8 - I liked it a whole lot better than season 7 and even season 6 for that matter.  The season 8 finale is stunning.  I don't want to give anything away, but there are twists and turns in season 8 that I did not see coming.  I just love it when they do that!  The acting is great!  You can just tell the J's are having a good time.  There were also some great guest appearances and some regulars that you will be glad to see.  I do wish there would have been more classic rock, but they did throw some in.  Hopefully season 9 will have more music.  Hey, at least the Impala is back!  For me, it is just pure entertainment.  The finale left a lot of questions and exciting things to think about for season 9.  The possibilities are endless.....  I can't wait for season 9 to start on Tuesday nights this fall!  Bring it!!!!
B007N6NGYG|5.0|My grandson enjoys this, although it is slightly more difficult than expected.  I think watching the trains and making sure more than one doesn't crash has been a learning experience in watching what's going on around him and watching for dangerous situations.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The bomb! What it is. Does not fake the funk. Would be dumbest thing you ever did in your life is not buy and play this game, stupid.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Guess I didn't read enough about it--deleted as soon as I tried playing.  If you are into other social media you might like it.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|Love the CD.  Love the set.  Love the Who.<br /><br />However, I was expecting something a little different.  I expected a stronger rougher version of Live at Leeds.<br /><br />This is different in that the whole Tommy is performed - all the good and the few goofy/spotty bits.<br /><br />For a major Who fan, this was a bonus and a great \\"must have.\\"<br /><br />Moon is unbelievable throughout the concert.  He was certainly their not so secret weapon.<br /><br />Entwistle is great but a little muffled.<br /><br />Pete is incredible but a little out of tune on a few numbers.  I did, however, walk away believing he is a much better guitar player than most people give him credit for - at least me.:)<br /><br />Roger is fine - but he is not as prominent as Keith and Pete.  As a matter of fact, it is the extended bits where the instrumental power trio takes over that knocked me out.  Can these three guys really make that much music?  The writing also impressed me.  Pete was really trying for something profound and he often found it.  They sound like no one else.<br /><br />Lastly, when Ivan the Engine Driver and Uncle Ernie are performed in such close proximity, it did make me think of Pete's recent court experience.  Interesting, but not appealing.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It's a fun way to pass the time.  Not as good as some of the original, but OK. Try it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We had heard so much about Downton Abbey, so were interested in seeing if we'd like it.  Yes, we did!  Sometimes it's hard to keep all the characters straight, but it kept our interest.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We really started to see the growth of all of the characters and the evolution of the group this season. Merle actually becomes a sympathetic character. Carl becomes a scary little kid. Rick just goes nuts, but then pulls it together when needed. On the other hand, I didn't see much development between Maggie and Glenn. Even more surprising, there was negative growth in the governers character, and his role ended abruptly.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this digital Bible. It is super easy to navigate and has lots of helpful features. It was easy installed and a really good app!
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I loved the book, and I love Peter Jackson's films. I didn't really pay attention to the pre-movie hype, so I was a little disappointed to learn that this is only the first half of the story. However, I gave it five stars because the movie merits it.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Good little love story! It was exciting, sad, scary, & just a good chick flick! I watched it two days in a row!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love it  it is totally awesome it's really worth it  you have to solve a murder and its really long!!and that's good if you like this I bet you will like who is the killer? Buy it buy it buy it buy it cheese burger!!!!!
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Jack Reacher is an above-average crime thriller that boasts an enthralling story and a great performance from Tom Cruise. This movie has something for everybody; action, humor, intrigue, and an engaging plot with a few twists. I really enjoyed Cruise as the title character, as there's some great supporting cast members here as well, including Rosamund Pike, Richard Jenkins, Robert Duvall, and Werner Herzog as the mysterious foreigner known as The Zec. I had a lot of fun watching this one and hope there's a sequel made at some point.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|best game and movie ever. I love it I like pies rate this game 5 stars every one do it for Tony stark
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I think this would be even better if you got the CDs.  As I read I kept Tina's voice in my<br />head so I thought - &#34;shoulda got the CDs&#34;  Anyway, very funny and insightful.  Gives<br />you a good idea of what these actresses go though on a daily basis.  Nice to know they<br />have the same insecurities that &#34;real&#34; people do.  Very funny and witty
0393064476|5.0|Mr. Greenblatt's style is very effective and presents his thoughts in an interesting format.  Some of the criticism of the category as history I feel is due to Mr. Greenblatt's generous imputation and speculation of the causation on why the people did what they did.  It would be hard to refute the facts he presents that people did commit.  Why they did them could also be cast in a historical novel.  When we see America's Congress locked in gridlock, the military industrial complex reaping vast sums of money (7 Trillion in 10 years), it is a wonder humanity is any better off than it was and Mr. Greenblatt's book caused me to think, &#34;Are we really??
B001I45UFC|5.0|This was a great read for any age.  It is a timeless classic which parallels greatly with the Gospel story.
0345803507|1.0|Book two was pretty bad but I'm one of those people who like to finish a series. Book 3 is almost unreadable. Talk about repetitive and dim. Nothing happens but Ana thinking how Fifty he is and them boinking every 5 min. There is very little actual plot. It really is like a porno..the plot is just secondary to the sex. I don't know what kind of people are giving this a good review..its complete drivel.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show! This season of the show was just as good as season 1. I recommend this show if you like dramas.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Fantasy & political intrigue that is simply gripping.  Very long books that I couldn't put down!  Fantasy aspects creep in slowly, adding an air of believability
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Great disc, music is good, video is good, stage is good, it worth of money although it took 3 weeks to send to me.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|3D was great as well as the movie itself. Lots of action and a great story!!!! Can't wait for the next movie.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I am a big Michael Pollan fan, and this book was another winner. Perhaps a little less &#34;heavy&#34; than his last couple of books, but enjoyable nonetheless. I enjoyed reading about his attempts to learn to cook in certain ways, and have even been inspired to have another go at doing sourdough bread from scratch. Definitely a good read.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game. Great graphics, creators please create another one with even more challenges. Loved the 3D aspect of it as well. Don't pass this one up.
B001DTTG16|2.0|This movie was a bit boring, and the main character was really irritating and unlikable. The dancing was good, but dated.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Be there from the beginning with Grey as they enter Season 10! Grey begins her career and her relationship with McDreamy!
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|One of my favorite albums. And not just bc of Stairway. Battle of Evermore and Four Sticks. Such under rated songs butgreat! This album is played everyday.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|good quick read..not complicated..doesn't require effort to figure it out..characters not very realistic..i read it in a few hours..probably won't read other works by this author
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book will be helpful even if your marriage is doing great. Its nice to finally figure out that its OK to have a primary love language and not have master them all. A huge relief!
B009R659L8|5.0|ms.clark has done it again..characters are realistic and are fairly complicated..the plot was not overly difficult but still had the shocker at  the end..i did like the fact that there  was a follow-up after the climax..liked to know where the characters were going
B000FC12L4|5.0|Several things stood out in this book & series, I really love the concept of charter magic the 9 hells & the originally of the world...I've never read of good, respected necromancers.  I love that
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Reichs always blends good science with a realistic story. Her characters seem alive and the readers can relate to their personalities.
0743555996|1.0|Ok, if you thought reading the novel was bad, listening to it out loud has to be a thousand times worse!!!! Im not gonna get into any details about the book and why its so incredibly awful because its all been said in minute detail in literally hundreds of these amazon reviews already. And believe me, every single negative thing that was said in all those reviews is absolutely true and accurate. All i want to say is that listening to this book being read aloud is EVEN MORE annoying than actually reading it. I kept yelling aloud to my player to SHUT THE EFF UP for cryin out loud!! My god, i wanted to just smash my player it was that bad. The only reason i finished it is because i wasted money buying it and to not finish it would have meant an even bigger waste of money!! Thank god i dont pay full price for any stephen king book that came out past 1988ish. And the only reason why i even bother to read any of his books anymore is on the off chance that maybe, just MAYBE he might churn out something thats even remotely close to what he used to write in his glory days. Not much chance of that ever happening. But one can always hope. Sigh...
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|If you have to reformat your Kindle Fire HD like I did, you'll lose the bonus content so you have to buy it again. I made the added mistake of purchasing 2 other Dash games, same result. I'll play the PC version instead.<br /><br />Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Lesson learned.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is great if you have a short wait somewhere.  Most of the games only take a few minutes and are pretty easy. There is not that much skill required and it is fun game most of the family.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonder how on earth these folks took themselves so seriously. Really love the big cozy 'house' and the simple, decent themes of good, bad, evil and stupidity. But was fun to imagine the excitement of the electricity, the auto and the telephone. A bygone era indeed, both in terms of the lifestyle and PG rated TV writing. So refreshing. Paid for Zulu to get first two seasons and purchased season 3 from Amazon. Enjoyed every minute!
B009GEAPYW|2.0|I have been curious about this video as well as part 2. I can say I'm glad I watched it on Netflix, instead of buying it. I'm not too far gone, meaning I realize this is an animation based on a Superhero, but I like my animation dipped into a little realism, this video has none. Batman is an old man, that part is cool, but he get's shot at CONSTANTLY and never gets hit, no stealth, just everyone misses. The mutants look ridiculous, Joker's voice is terrible, and how does Robin get sooo good soo fast? You will have to view Part 2 to really understand what I mean,but this just wasn't for me.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A book not quite finished by the original author and the threads of the tale woven together by another is usually a recipe for disaster. But not this time. Robert Jordan gave us a fantastic world to live and play in just as Tolkien, and others, did before him. But as he died he gave us another storyteller to finish what he couldn't. Brandon Sanderson exceeded all expectations and finished the story that seemed at times to be unfinishable. My heartfelt thanks goes out, belatedly, Robert Jordan and still goes to Brandon. The book wrapped up the story lines that were so diverse and twisted within each of the other lines that only a master storyteller ( or two ) could have pulled off the stunt. It's a wonderful read and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00B7FXYJG|2.0|I have been curious about this video as well as part 1. I can say I'm glad I watched it on Netflix, instead of buying it. I'm not too far gone, meaning I realize this is an animation based on a Superhero, but I like my animation dipped into a little realism, this video has none. Batman is an old man, that part is cool, but he get's shot at CONSTANTLY and never gets hit, no stealth, just everyone misses.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If there were more games as good as this, I'd never get anything done. It's a great change of pace. Love it!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|It is difficult to believe that an entire country's population could be programmed into believing absolutely untrue facts about their leader.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|This is my favorite movie. It is filled with imagination, excitement, wonderment, and everything that makes me love life. The word Magical best describes this movie. There are actors in this movie I swear had never made a good movie before but some how were amazing in this movie. The music was perfectly matched with the scenes. You really become immersed in the movie and feel as though you are there.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Witty, thrilling, sexy action series with clones.  What more could you ask for?  Tatiana is amazing playing so many different versions of herself.  Sleek production exploring tantalizing themes.
030758836X|5.0|Book club book of 2012. It was everything it was supposed to be. I have yet to meet a person that does not like this book. My copy of Gone Girl has gone missing because of everyone in my life. I would definitely recommend reading this. And the beginning of this book is slow. But once you get to part II it is all excitement. I could not put it down. I am the person who puts down an excellent books because I cannot keep my eyes open. I read through the night and desperately wanted to call into work to finish. (Too Much?) I am waiting for the movie!!!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A realistic treatment of a space explorer stranded on Mars who must use his training and luck to survive.  It mixes his journal of his activities on Mars with dialog from mission control interspersed throughout.  Enjoyable read that makes you long for a NASA manned mission to Mars.
B0018CENUC|5.0|It was easy to download on to my ipod and will get more songs in the future.  Want all their music.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great season exploring the group's interaction with the Governer.  Intense, violent, and smart exploration of human nature at its best and worst.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I was getting bored with my old apps and then I found this one!  It is a great game  to play, and you can do the be really involve with it of just play it for fun.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was intrigued from the first chapter ,throughout the novel. This was well written. The end makes me want to read the final book immediately.
0446581356|1.0|This book can be informative, but it wasn't what I was looking for.  The only real step by step tutorial is for the smokey eye.  I really wouldn't recommend it
B005ERYEGU|5.0|Simple, quick read and debunks all &#34;old&#34; sales books/knowledge I had. Already implemented some of the processes in this book & seeing great first results!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This a good game for true iron man fans and have always wanted to kind of know what it is like to be iron man
B00130UFY2|4.0|I've read all of the Jason Bourne books and frankly prefer the Matt Damon films.<br />Unlike many lead actors, he underplays the role with a quiet determination and fearlessness.<br />If you enjoy action films, the Bourne movies will be satisfying.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I like the way the plot flowed and made you want to keep reading.  I was able to finish book in two days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg this game is amazing it's very additive never been of it for more than a day deck download xxx
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't wait until I had time to just sit down for a minute and read.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|Awesome..it really does what u want it to do people might think that it's bad but it's not once u get to know what to do :)
B009GX6600|5.0|IT'S JUST THE BEST! Consistently good after all these years and you can feel the chemistry that they still have after all these years
B009VSW15Y|2.0|There is no real application for me for this app with Kindle.  It is very awkward to take a picture with only the camera looking at the user.
B009GX6TQ6|5.0|Season 4 and it still works and keeps you interested and what would we do without Hetty? Looking forward to next season.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I really like the speed of the game as well as the animations.  I like to be surprised of the next level and this game delivers.
B00COGYUAE|5.0|Bat-tastic fun for the whole Bat-family, from Caped Crusaders to Boy Wonders, from Batgirls to Batwomen, from Dick Graysons to Damian Waynes! The major movie studios should just let LEGO and its partners make all the movies! All. The. Movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the ONLY REAL minecraft out there and it is fun but when it starts<br />To get boring I play another app.<br /> updates come on minecraft
B001DUDKEY|5.0|When I was finally able to watch the ending it was great.  I enjoyed it very much and like the British touch in the romances for this era.
147674355X|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Hopeless and was completely surprised about the twist...I definitely did not see that coming! Holder and Sky's connection was very apparent very early on.  I would definitely recommend this book but would not read it again.  Too emotional and very intense.
B00992CF6W|3.0|this game is a fail but the only reason I said that is beacuse it would not let me get the game
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is very fun and addictive. the second download may take a bit of time but it is worth every minute!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Coming from someone who has never gotten into reading and has a hard time focusing and processing literature, this book caught me from the first page. The vivid detail and edgy wording kept me in a trance as if I could actually see everything that was happening around me. I caught myself turning the pages before I had even finished reading them because I wanted to see what was coming next! It has been over six years since I have read a book cover to cover, let alone in such a short period of time. I can not wait to finish the next two and I look forward to reading them!
B00CL6GAD2|4.0|Two actors that I like in a predictable plot and storyline. Wahlberg continues to hone his acting skills and Crowe is pretty good in this departure from his usual role as the hero. Worth watching.<br /><br />W.J.Milton
B00A3XQVKW|4.0|I was enthralled with this reading!  It revealed for me that the things which seem like aliterations and parables in scripture are literal.  Now I no longer fear death, for I now understand that death of the spirit is a judgement by God, not cessation of our physical life.  Thank you Betty Eadie for revealing that which resides in the Light of Jesus.
B00COHIFQS|2.0|...Or perhaps it's more correct to call this a &#34;ghost story&#34; since it is mildly spooky at points, though the rather bathetic ending had me rolling my eyes. If your looking for chills, look elsewhere.
B004KA9UX4|5.0|This book is one of the great tomes in jazz pedagogy. Beyond theory it makes important connections between music performance and analysis.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to use and adds are short and sweet- this solitaire app is also more customizable than others I have tried
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I love this game. If match games are your thing and you love fish this is the game for you.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it.  I enjoyed the attraction. It was interesting. It kept me wondering what will happen next.  The first book took me awhile to get used to Christian's sex and control, but after that each book got better. I hate I am finished.
B003O6R2DK|4.0|I used to have this soundtrack on tape; I bought it years ago when we visited Snoqualmie, Washington (where they filmed Twin Peaks). I've moved it with me for years before it finally occured to me that I no longer own a tape player! I also went back to school this year and was looking for some instrumental music to listen to while studying and doing homework. I find that blocking out the noise of my kids, husband and animals with music really helps me focus, and music without lyrics is especially helpful because your brain isn't concentrating on the words. I loved the music from Twin Peaks 20 years ago and I still enjoy it today, especially the Love Theme, Laura Palmer's Theme, and Twin Peaks Theme-just hauntingly beautiful. I also enjoy Falling and The Nightingale by Julee Cruise. They both have lyrics, but they are subdued, her voice is almost ethereal-so I've included both of them in my Study playlist.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|I love the way Michael Buble' sings this song!  It is a little different from his other songs, and that is one reason I really love it! Michael does a GREAT job, and what a great song to listen to, over and over!<br /><br />OSSlady
B002W19I8U|4.0|I agree with most of the other reviewers who mentioned the horrible synthesized beat they they added to The Ivory Tower. I don't understand why anyone in their right mind would have done that. Its still however, a great sountrack. I use music as background noise when I'm studying to drown out the ruckus of my family, and instrumentals are especially helpful because then my brain dowsn't concentrate on the lyrics. I'm a child of the 80s so this was one of my favorite movies growing up-Gmork still scares the beejezus out of me, lol, so it isn't included on my study playlist, but I might use it for a Halloween playlist. I haven't been able to find a version of the Ivory Tower without the horrible addition so until I do this sountrack is just fine.
B0095P31L6|5.0|The movie was cute & being in high definition made it even better.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great family movie to watch.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love playing subway surf on my spear time. I play on my kindle or smart phone at times.THe graphics are awesome and I love the changes from one country to the next. My family plays a lot too,we try to compete with one.another.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It seemed more real than story like. Seemed like people that I would like to have known.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Only app that worked to regain my icons and my Kindle is just as fast as when I first got it. Highly recommend.
B009R659L8|3.0|A long-time Mary Higgins Clark fan, I eagerly await each new book.  Her writing always grabs me on the first page.  This particular book, however, was let-down from her usual intrigue.  It was distracting to keep track of all the characters and how they all fit together.  In spite of that challenge, I was able to figure out the whole story long before the end.  This is the first time that's happened.<br />This is the only Mary Higgins Clark book I would not recommend.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|still sounds like a VW album, but the sound has come a long way. great songwriting and suggests VW might have a few more good ones in them
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The gameplay is fun and interesting but after about an hour of play there are many, many options and choices you can make and its a little too much to start. More explanation would be nice with the option of less information / skipping if wanted.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This network of lives and their events is woven carefully and intelligently through separate planes of different times.  A job well done!
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Having been a Deep Purple fan since the Perfect Strangers album I must say that the Now What?! Release is a grand slam! Gillan/Glover/Paice have not lost their spark along with Steve Morse and Don Airey of Rainbow fame. With this project you hear veteran musicians at their very best. I love this album! Best album since Perfect Strangers. If you are a Deep Purple fan, pick this up and crank it!! No disappointments whatsoever!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Oh, Tom!  Strip to your briefs, grab a make-believe microphone and slide provocatively while singing with good backup!  Mr. Cruise should remain with things he did well and stop trying to crawl into the Fountain of Youth and out as a new Action Hero!!!!  Go home, Tom!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game with hidden puzzles and objects to figure out! I found myself not able to put it down until completed...loved it!
B00BG4RLF6|5.0|A new evolution of a great talent from England , a wonderful synthesis of rhythm & blues & electronic that explores a very personal sound !
B00COHAUD4|3.0|I watched Mama a few nights ago with my husband he thought it was stupid,it of course tugged at my heart being a Mama myself,<br />anyway I don't want to give a lot away for those that have not watched it but please watch the face of the Mama creature change at the end<br />and let me know if you realized something my husband did not and that is why he didn't like it,<br />he didn't understand it from the point of view a mother would have so...<br /> that being said, keep your heart open, but not too much cuz Mama might rip it out! ;)
B005AKFXZW|5.0|I know I'm one to give away high accolades for books to easily. However once in a while that backfires and I find my self needing more stars. This is one of those times. The Night Circus is an amazing book that is filled with wonder, love and magic. I can't recommend it enough. This is what the love child of Neil Gaiman and Susanna Clark would write, though I suppose Ms. Morgenstern is of different parentage.<br /><br />If magic, love and the rapture of the circus is anywhere near to your heart, you will love 'The Night Circus'!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This series is both intelligent and entertaining. It reminds me of &#34;Suits&#34;, but includes a female main character, with a family. Every episode has a great story-line, with a continuing cast of great characters.
0307476464|5.0|It is an extraordinary piece of literature: a conflation of philosophy comedy humour  and human pathos. It is life with its sublime contradictions.  Velon.
B00881PTRC|4.0|I play this on a 10.1 Motorola Xyboard. Sometimes on 2 player, when I try to make a word, certain letters to the left don't work like &#34;A&#34;. I have to restart the app. Despite that, I don't really care because it's just as fun. The animations are humorous.
B0094D462M|5.0|Good action Adventure story for all generations to watch again. Brought back old times, and fun movie to share with this generation.
B002DEI4NG|2.0|I found the pilot show boring. I just was not impressed with the acting, the story line, any of it. Didn't need to see more. Yawn...
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I just downloaded it 2 days ago for my kindle fire, so far I am very pleased with it. Would recommend it.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|First let me say that the story itself was a bit too choppy, there was potential there that was seriously not used to it's advantage. Maybe too much was cut or the wrong scenes kept? The acting was good, but I just not into Channing Tatum, sorry, was hoping there would be a bit more of some of the others guys.
0385738781|5.0|I read the other two books and this one was my favorite. I finished it within a few days. I couldn't put it down. I've never cried over a book the way I did with this one. I loved the entire series!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Really like it. Good story and great acting. Looking forward to the next Star Trek movie. My daughter liked it too.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|If you didn't read the book the movie would have been good but I did not like the way so much was changed from the book
B005H9B44A|1.0|I was in the mood to watch something like Gladiator only with Chris Hemsworth...and then I realized it was a Sci-fi alien movie. No thanks. Not even Chris Hemsworth is enough to get me to watch a bunch of aliens.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The first app I install on any of my android devices. It's indispensable. Best in class predictive text with great stats showing how many keystrokes it's saved you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am an adult and just loved this trilogy. The character development along with the twists and turns are terrific. Surprises both sad and hopeful abound, without taking from the genuine quality of the story line and the emotions expressed and involked. Great trilogy. Great second book.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This is a must-have CD because it has all the great songs . You do not have to a die-hard Garth Brooks fan to enjoy it!
B00BESLHEA|5.0|If you love 70's era kung fu movies then you will LOVE this one!!! Fantastic action ,cheesy script(a 70's throw back),lots of blood and great stunts!!! If you don't like old style kung fu movies then you will not like this movie!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is pretty good. You've got some action,fighting ,and building all together and I recommend this game so I hope you play it!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This show is FANTASTIC!!!!! The History Channel really knocked this right outta the ballpark!!! Look forward to every episode!! And so true to life!!
1451695195|5.0|I just loved his experience because I believe Human Kind could take enourmous advantage on knowing our real primordial and spiritual essence. Thank you for public his experiences.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Just started playing and it is fun. I think my Grandson is better at it than I am.  We will enjoy it.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I loved this book. It was awesome. It kept me interested and I was pleased. I recommend you read it.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|Just like the board game, Blockus, only the computer is harder to beat than those people whom I usually play with!
B009NY43NY|4.0|First, let me say, I have followed this story since the very beginning. Each & every book I read in one day - couldn't put it down, totally engrossed, ensnared. This book took me many days, over one week to complete, from start to finish. I stayed the course b/c this is the last one to complete this series & I am a loyal reader. Having said that, I fought to finish & here is why: 1) there are parts throughout that were clearly of a differing tone than all of the other books, a different voice, if you will 2) several parts felt rushed, forced 3) very little storyline revolved around or included the vamps - there was little in-depth direct involvement. It was given matter of fact, in spurts here or there, w/very little dialogue w/Sookie vs all of the prior books, so w/this being the final one, it would've been great to have a satisfying & concluding series! 4) all along, Sookie had a love triangle been Bill & Eric where she was &#34;in love&#34; w/Eric (she had other trysts, of course, but the focus was always about these two vamps) - then, BAM - very cold, short dialogue is shared by she & Eric & that's that, done, over, caput. Again, same w/Bill. Just felt robbed of having been given full closure before she jumps into the sack w/her BFF, Sam...Then, it ends. I know Charlene has stated she felt she did her best to stay true to these characters so going into this final book, I kept a respective, open mind. However, with all due respect, it felt more like a billboard of plugging businesses than providing readers proper closure or &#34;staying true to the characters&#34;. Every other page seemed to plug a biz. This was distracting due to the frequency. Also, this was not just a standalone or a 3-novel trilogy. There has been some major cash invested with the purchase of each of these novels & every single one before now was well worth their price. Overall, I'm absolutely certain the author invested hours of her time writing this book. I know, understand & respect this.I'm also grateful. I'm just honestly saying, in my opinion, it didn't deliver as ALL of the others in this series. The last 30% of this book delivered more than the first 70%, hence why I struggled with this. If you're a loyal Sook fan, I recommend reading it, no doubt. I'm giving it a 3.5 stars but since there aren't halves, I'm rounding up to give the author regarded respect for finishing the series & for sharing Sookie w/us.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a amazing game.  It is one of the best games on my kindle.  I love  the game more than anything.
B00884GR0W|5.0|However, when I go to hell, my frame rate drops from around 30 to around 10 and kicks me out. This makes it hard to get unobtanium and sulpher, limiting me to the weaker swords. My only supply of these items is the shadow hunter. I have to kill him multiple times to get one of these items. It is difficult trying to kill someone who has 1,200 health and does ridiculous damage. This is the only flaw I have found in the entire game, and I got one character to level 40 without damage upgrades and 1 to 30.overall this is an excellent game for the price.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching this show a couple months ago and got hooked. The purchase was very easy, just simply pressed buy and the show was downloaded onto my device in minutes. The picture is also very clear
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I had never heard of Ultra Marathons before reading this book. Some great natural and power food recipes throughout which were unexpected. If you are looking for a super motivational book, this is not it. But it does speak to personal failure, driving yourself and purpose. Along with detailed accounts of grueling 150 miles races. This guy's story is interesting and deserves to have a voice.
1451668945|5.0|I bought this book for my wife as she loves to read Mary Higgins Clark's novels and had read every one except for this one which just came out.  She was not disappointed saying that it was as good as the others she had read and how she was already looking forward to the next one.  If you like Mary Higgins Clark's novels, it's well worth the money.
B007L6VR12|2.0|Oddly, in a movie where your emotions should be vested in what happens to two misfit runaway kids, in \\"Moonrise Kingdom,\\" you just don't care.  The problem is that none of the characters connect emotionally in the film. The dialogue is delivered in a robotic, deadpan way throughout, such that what you get is dialogue trying to sound cutesy but without any real emotional connection to the people who are actually delivering the dialogue.  It's almost like robot-speak.  This becomes tedious, affected and deadening, and unfortunately the script is far less eccentric or humorous than it would seem to believe itself to be.  Here's about as close to any real bond as we get between the runaway boy and girl, starting with the girl: \\"It feels hard.\\" \\"Do you mind?\\" \\"I like it.\\" \\"You can touch my chest.  I think they're gonna grow more.\\" I mean, is this for real?  It sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks by way of David Mamet.  Even as the movie spins out of control at the end, which is all too predictable, you don't really care about any of these characters.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|The best pinball game hands down for the kindle fire hd....i have 2 of the first 3 games and cant wait to get the third.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Benefited so much from this author's journey.  This is one of those books that I keep on my list to read again in years to come.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one! This is the second time I read this book, and I loved it more this time.
B002QZ399G|5.0|As far as I can tell this is probably pretty true to exactly what has and what is going on in the Middle East.
B0076DELIG|4.0|It is a true Harry Bosch showing his trials being an  &#34;old&#34; guy and using his intuition to solve the case.<br />The human side of his life is well portrayed as well<br />J
B0094M2NTG|5.0|If you need a laugh and shed a tear or two this is a keeper, I can't tell you how many times I've watched it, but it's quite a number now.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Decent game. I enjoy playing it and it is a good time passer. I would recommend it to others. Thanks.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This is a free down load that I have not had the chance yet to us. Of course if it is anythng like You tube I will love it. Who wouldnt?
B005QPMB2Y|2.0|I have a Q-See system with one Revo PTZ camera. There is no way to configure protocol. So I cannot control this camera with this program.<br /><br />The other thing I do not like, is that I cannot uninstall the Amazon Store. If I do uninstall the Amazon store, the program does not work at all. I did pay for it.
B0083Z614S|5.0|The book was surprisingly good. I would have never read it if it wasn't free, but I am glad that I did. Great book and it definitely deserved five stars.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was really fun! I beat it in one day! The only down side is it to short but makes up in all the things you have to do! The clues are ok not the best but who wants clues that just tell you out right what to do? Really worth the price! : )
B00CDT41RY|3.0|It is a movie well understand for the time racism was going on the USA, but the movie seems to be so unreal and it lasts so long!!!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I chose my rating based off of how closely I identify with the main character, the writing style, and the over all enjoyment from the quirky setting. I recommend this book to any high school student, mainly because of the high school setting. I highly recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a good story of finding one's self and the struggles of living your life different and with a secret.
B009R659L8|3.0|This book was rather  predictable.  It would be a quick fluff read for the beach.  I would wait for paperback.
B00CL50KDY|4.0|I bought this movie for my teenage boys and really ended up liking it myself.  New twist on an old idea and it really worked well.  Very cute.
B0046RE5GI|4.0|I enjoy escapist reading on occasion -- more as get older....  Poirot's world is like peanut butter for me, despite the gruesome murders, there is always the assurance of justice and amusement along the way.
B009NLC1D6|4.0|I have watched  1/2 of the movie on my Kindle. I am enjoying the movie--I seem to love most British movies.<br />I am liking Gandi, but I do like others better. This movie drags a bit.That is why it is taking time for me to get back to<br />the movie when I put it away.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|I enjoy most of Jane Austen's works. This one is not heard of as much. But still a great story.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Great book that gives you a greater appreciation for the simple things in life--food, water, and shelter. If you're Catholic you'll enjoy this book and find yourself snickering, chuckling and shedding a tear or two.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so much fun I think the creator is super smart. He created a fun, educating, genuine game. I love this game. I originaly thought it was silly and a waste of money! But then I played it on my brothers ipod and now, I love it.  There is so much u can do!!! AMAZING :&gt; BEST GAME :D BUY IT ITS WORTH YOUR MONRY!!!  :)
0525950079|4.0|This book is a sequel to Follett's Pillars of the Earth. It's a generation or two later as we enter this world. A young girl is forced to pick pocket a lord during a church service, as her family is dirt poor, starving, and without prospects. The book then follows this young pick pocket girl and the group of kids she encounters that day on their journey of life in these hard scrabble times. If you want fast paced and thrilling, this is not the book for you. If you want settle-back, in for the long haul enjoy the journey, this book is definitely for you.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This is the perfect game for those people who want a challenge but don't want anything close to impossible. Enjoy!
B00846REIS|5.0|really enjoyed this book. Along with the next one. A must read! I didn't want to at first because I was a 50 shades fan, but it's not the same. In fact it's better. The writing of it is worded so much better. LOVE IT!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I'm a recent fan to the Walking Dead. I love being able to watch the series at my own pace when I want, so having the series on disc is awesome. Highly recommend to fans of the show.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome and I can't wait for the next update. One of my favorite world seeds is Nyan Cat<br />.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Requires some thoughts<br />Pros:  nice graphics, solvable, I wanted to continue.<br />Cons: tad buggy on the kindle but always came back. (I think it's WiFi problem....).  Clues to easy to hit accidentally. That icon should require  double tap.<br />Biggest thing that bugged me was the pros tablet interactions weren't necessary, seemed like they were there on because you can do it.<br /><br />I did this in three sittings,took a couple hours. Nice job.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Its ok it a clock not much to do there its good about get you up in the morning and tell you what its like outside
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love this game. Downloaded the full version with no problem. Now I cannot put it down. Thank you!<br />If you enjoy aquariums  you will want Fishdom.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Her books are fascinating, well written, contain different subject matter, and it's easy to become engrossed in them.  I would recommend reading her novels - and start with this one!
B000S9HVZU|5.0|Cunningham's acclaimed, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel moved at the core of my being. There are very few writers who possess the godlike skill of using language to make you understand every pain, hope, love, and loss of their characters-to use words to move your soul. That sounds cheesy, but I'm a day from finishing the book and I still feel emotionally bludgeoned by The Hours.<br /><br />The rest of the review is over here! http://litbeetle.com/2013/05/18/on-cunninghams-the-hours/
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Game really fun helps me pass the time. The fast pace keeps my mind going. The timer keeps u on your toes.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Very heart felt and well written.  You will especially enjoy it if you are a dog lover.  I would recommend this book.
1440503257|4.0|I can't believe that there isn't a butter beer recipe! That's so lame! Other than that, it's wonderful and perfect.
B0059XTV4Y|3.0|Too confusing with all the back and forth. Guess I was expecting a better storyline.  Just a bit disappointing is all
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Wonderful characters are what drive this show.  It is the one show that consistently makes me laugh outloud.  The episode where Sheldon finds the letter from Howard's father was very touching and demonstrated how much this quirky group of friends care about each other.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Kept you on the edge the entire book.  Can't wait for the next book to come out.  Enjoyed reading this plus Bared to you.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Really got caught up in the story between Frank and Mayma.  Loved learning about the women's movement during that time and many of the historical facts.  Found Frank both fascinating and infuriating.  Sometimes Mayma and her decisions confused me.  Was not prepared, nor did I expect the ending.  So tragic.  Would recommend this book.
B009K0P10K|5.0|The show is great...even with all of the splinter/side stories.  It's kind of hard to believe in someone being so ruthless about getting revenge when you think about it, but that kind of trauma and love could force anyone to become monsters like her.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Long-haired partially clad Daniel Day-Lewis and Eric Schweig in their prime, chasing after deer and bad guys?  What's not to like?  But seriously, while the film isn't faithful to the book's story (and if you're looking for that faithfulness, you'll be pretty disappointed), it is still beautifully told.  The cinematography, music, script, acting, production values, all make this a moving and very watchable film.
B000O77QD8|5.0|Just for the war bonds that they &#34;changed&#34; the fact of war?  However, it made my heart sink if this account was true.
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|This show is for a mature, intellectual audience.  At first the murders can be shocking; however when you moved pass that and open up your mind to the intellectual dialogue of the characters its an educations on human behavior and the complexities it often entails.  This show is a winner on that fact alone.
B000O77RLE|5.0|Makes the viewers kind of sad in some of the graphic scenes, but true accounts of what went on behind the war.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I liked just about everything about this book.  I really like that it was written from different characters points of view<br />.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I watched this movie tonight - not knowing anything about it beforehand and not having read the book.  I must say, this is a movie that one has to experience with the heart, not the head.  The grandeur of the human spirit, as well as the tragedy of the human spirit - I can't say enough good things about it.  For those reviewers here who are repulsed by the gay lovers, I say maybe you are missing the entire point of the movie.  To others I say, don't worry about who is who and in what storyline - relax and just let the movie wash over you and it will all make sense in the end.  Beautifully done!
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|After having a good listen to this I have come to the conclusion that its an ok CD of Jimi Hendrix. If you have Valleys Of Neptune you would know that a few songs were overdubbed digitally to add better guitar or some better vocals from another session of the same song. Well this 2013 release has done this again with similar results only slightly off on this occasion. Sadly the version of Crash Landing is out of sync with some of the vocal and guitar overdubs that were recently engineered. This is very noticeable if you are a fan and have the original version on hand as I.<br />What I can say in a strongly positive point is how well the drums sound compared to bootleg versions. There is also a lot more power in Jimi's guitar sound which has been brought up in the mix.<br />It is becoming obvious that the well is running dry indeed for another studio CD such as this as most of these songs although quite good pale in comparison compared to similar versions on other official albums.<br />One track I have found to be incredible is the instrumental Inside Out. This is a stunning track that sounds fresh and exciting.<br />As a cohesive album I really am not convinced this works but it is a collection of one of the greatest guitar players to ever exist and this is a good example of what Jimi can do.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|My Wife and I absolutely enjoyed the accompaning music to this Movie and are looking forward to adding this to our collection of Movie Soundtracks. One of the best Movies for this summer, we already have Notification lined up with Amazon to pre-order this Movie in 3D.
B007CI81IQ|4.0|Esther Duflo and Abhisit Banerjee do an admirable job of comparing two radically different views on how to deal with global poverty (Sachs & Easterly). They discuss a wide array of issues related to poverty, its roots and remedies, and offer empirical data to support or refute popular notions. I would highly recommend the book to anyone wanting to learn more about the fight against poverty.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Just watched this movie last night, and this is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen Hanks do. He and Hallie each did about 6 different roles (not to mention the other cast members who did the same). It is multiple story lines that are interwoven and connect with each other that come to an amazing climax that will not dissapoint. I highly recommend this movie.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|This one kept me guessing. I usually have some idea who did what but not this time.  Good read.  Ready for his next.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Great serie of the WWII, a piece that any coleccionist of action movies must have, and for a great price
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Works great. Now I can watch my favorite sitcoms on the go. Plus music videos. Beter than waiting for the video to load.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Saw Shinedown in concert, they put on a great show, made me purchase their albums to relive the night. MOST AWESOME SHOW!
B0094M4OW0|1.0|After the initial 10 minute setup, the movie was a bust. The chemistry between Smith and Lawrence just didn't work. It was as if they both just wanted the filming to be over.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|+Awesome casual game. Very relaxing and calming for me. . A way to take care of horses if you can't own one.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Pollan's books always leave me thinking, and this one is no different.  It is a unique voice and perspective used to describe those things that are so ubiquitous in our lives that we take them for granted.  I think that if people understand the source and craft that is the foundation of the foods that we eat every day, then the entire experience of eating will become more of a 'pleasure' again and less of a calorie load - regardless of taste and nutrition.<br /><br />This book is a bit different from those that came here.  It opens your eyes to the industry, but doesn't tell you horror stories of GMOs and CAFOs.  I would insider it a good introduction into real and whole foods for people who are looking to break away from processed foods.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who eats,drinks, an ends up merry!
B009MYARIK|5.0|Kinsella's books are always quick reads you can't put down and this was no exception. It was a little ridiculous but that is what makes it fun.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Has many different levels and can keep the kids and adults occupied for hours. Cost isn't that high for what you get.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Done well from the video and audio standpoints and very well acted! This movie was very real and an honest 'look' at alcohol and drug use.<br /><br />As an aside; Drugs and alcohol have an effect on all humans, some good and some bad, but have an effect they do! Some &#34;addicts&#34; simply obtain their jobs through skills learned at a young age (prior to drug and alcohol use) which may eliminate many adult people. That job, coupled with an income and a bit of freedom, might then lead them to alcohol or drug abuse. I saw this first-hand as an Air Traffic Controller and those persons were eliminated as well.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|Good, quick read. Funny and heartwarming. You can't help but feel for Samantha. Although the masses seemed utterly stupid most of the time.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|This is my \\"go to\\" movie whenever there's nothing I want to watch on tv or just when I'm bored.
B009L7MD44|4.0|I use this for viewing images from my camera on my iPad. It works well with card readers where I pop the card into the reader and view using the browser or app. I could probably obtain the same thing using my Apple camera plugs but it easier with my case not having to worry about damaging the plug or camera kit adapter.<br /><br />Only downfall I have found is you are better off using a card reader than plugging the camera straight in as the communications with the camera tend to be a bit slow.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What a great book.  A true hero and one who deserves the respect of every American. With memorial day a week away, let's all show the respect that the fallen deserve.
B00CL50KDY|5.0|Wow this movie is amazingly original. When I first saw the trailer I was a bit worried about how it could be rom com but somehow the movie works really well. It's funny, romantic, and some good zombie kills. What more could you ask for. But don't expect to be scared it's not a scary movie.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Loved every episode just wish i didn't have to wait for season 9. It's always something we look forward to watching wondering what will happen next
B0082Z447U|1.0|Boring book and not one that holds your attention. You get through the first few pages and go, Oh gosh, another waste of money!
B0002HZ18C|5.0|I'm sixty-one and probably built this a least three times in my lifetime.  The last time was a few years ago and I was very pleased with the outcome.  I just purchased this one in anticipation building it again with perhaps some modifications and different paint job.  I can't say enough, this is a classic Revell model kit that i hope will keep modelers entertained for years to come.
B005BRSQ5I|5.0|I love deepak chopra. He writes from the heart and spirit of every reality! This book is a great pick me up when things seem bleak! Reminds us that the laws of the Universe carry us to and fro and that we are exactly where we need to be right now, right in this moment!
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It kept me entertained throughout and yet once will probably be enough.  If this was a film I wanted to watch multiple times, I'd give it five stars.
B00001W9G0|5.0|This is right up there with Gone with the Wind and Color Purple and Steel Magnolias!! Funny, and tear jerker at the same time!! Will watch over and over again!!! Love the Streisand Redford matchup!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a simple calculator, nothing fancy.  It's not intended for scientific formulas or equations.  But it's great for your I-Phone or Kindle to figure the amount of a tip at a restaurant or figuring out the age of a character in the book you're reading.  Best of all, it's free.
B001I8A76A|5.0|There is a little bit of everything in this album. Pink never disappoints! Her music is always fun and full of great surprises. It's my new workout soundtrack.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app battery hD is a good apoplexy for seeing how chafed. it is or how long till it die wicth I think is cool
B00CRR5YA0|4.0|Has a lot of similarity to the first Start Trek (2009) soundtrack, but enough difference to make it worth the purchase.
B000I9UA8U|5.0|...if you like British humor. Well done and very realistic. And truly fun! Probably not an appropriate movie for youngsters! Worth watching.
0345529057|5.0|Awesome books!<br />Even better than expected, the story is very excitant.<br />Cannot stop reading! Almost eating all the pages.<br />Recommended!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun and relaxing.  Good way to pass the time.  I recommend this game for all who like cards.  Go ahead and upload it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|ENTERTAINING! Keeps my mind busy while here! Great way to pass time! Been here for almost a month and glad I have this!
193700788X|1.0|You brought back Quinn for this?  After all was said and done she ended up with Sam?  Please.  I honestly would have respected the story more if she had ended up with Bubba.
B00COGXX7A|4.0|It was very well done and the story line was great until the unnecessary surprise ending. That spoiled it a bit for me.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|An amazing piece of writing takes the subject matter (zombies) out of simple genre fiction and makes it appealing to a wider audience.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love these types of games with quests where you search a scene to find clues. I play this a lot while in the carpool line at my daughter's school. This is a great game for passing time.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great for keeping my 5 yr old occupied. He enjoys selecting what to buy and working to get to the next level.
B008YU0AOE|2.0|This app has not been useful to me on my Kindle Fire.  I find it too cumbersome to power up my Kindle just to use a calculator with basic functions when I can more quickly and easily pull up a basic calculator on my smart phone or computer.
B00821OX98|5.0|Excellent story, action, directing, and costume.  So many post apocalyptic stories are unbelievable on screen, Falling Skies is the exception.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love that I can use this app to bid at the last minute on items that I've been watching on Ebay.  It helps me from missing out on a potential great deal when I'm away from my computer.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Only book I have read that brought tears to my eyes and more than once. It is a must read!
B000002O4X|5.0|The music brings back all the things I love about the movie!<br /><br />What is not to love about the CD!
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark never, never disappoints. She is always my go to author when I want a story that grabs your attention as well as your emotions. You can,t help but be drawn in to this story. Don,t miss it.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|this is a great game! I play it on my fiancee's k.f. and on mine!(I'm doing this review for him!)<br />great way to pass the time when waiting for meetings or dr's appt.<br />this game is one of my new favorites! ;-)<br />(review by: r.p.kinchen)
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Life of Pi was an unexpected delight.  I was expecting a kid movie but it definitely was not just for the younger set. I was wowed!!!!
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This book tells the story of a man experiencing a mid life crisis & his unlikely way of dealing with it. Harold journey is at times funny but at other times it is sad & you feel his pain
B005NFWCSK|4.0|The movie is frequently hokey, but the portrayal of mutant powers will please most fans of the comic, I think.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|The game is fun lots of stuff to do. I hate that it isn't very interactive with other players. I would like to be able to go to other people's park's and do something. Sorta seems like pointless to go to their parks and not be able to feed t the dinosaurs or anything. needs to be more interactive.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|You got to love the angry birds, this game is just to cute and funny at the same time, love this game.
0446672653|5.0|. Brian Weiss tells a romantic tale of two clients that he realizes are soulmates...sharing many lifetimes, but having not found each other here yet. I read it, and I'm now passing it around to my friends.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|even though the game may seem a bit lame at first, or look lame at first, this game is really addicting for sure,
B008KYOCA2|4.0|A little overwhelming at first but once I  played around with it, it had everything I needed including color coding.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Love this game it is too cute. My daughter and I just cant get enough of this game, we love this game...
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Well now, this is an interesting read into the sexual practices of others.  Quite an eye opener for me.  Might have even given me some ideas.  Surprised just how many I know who have read this.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I loved the book.it was a great book.<br /><br />I found a lot of words.thank you so much for the book
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Interesting to see how things that happen early in our lives can create such an impact on how we view, play etc in our present lives.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Sooooooooooooooooooooo fun I could play this for hours.  Well I have anyway.I highly recommend getting this game . Butt who takes advice from a ten year old:(
B003VANOFY|5.0|Excelent product and service, it is the best headphones in the existing categories, the sound is so complete and isolates the external sound in great way.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|It was an interesting book on the living conditions in Ireland back in World War II time and the hardships the people endured.
1433537419|5.0|Nice book nice cover, great features,great text,colorful maps and illustrations as stated .....It make an outstanding bible study book ! I am so please to owned one. The truth is I am new to bible .....not exactly new , I been to church in the past but barely read the bible because back then I was a teen and hardly find myself with any interest in the bible at the time but now I felt like I am in connection with the great lord Jesus Christ so I got this book and just begun to read it with excitement ! This book is easy to read and understandable! I strongly recommend it ! so get one and enjoy ! happy study bible reading time to all !!
B0067EKY7M|3.0|The script is breezy and British and tries to be witty, with cutesy music bouncing along throughout, but the writing is shallow and contrived, and the characters lack any real depth or emotion.  The story seems forced, as though the characters are being manipulated along the plot points, rather than the characters themselves driving the story.  For instance, immediately the Ewan McGregor character of Dr. Alfred Jones is introduced as over-the-top stuffy and dismissive, more like a cardboard figure than a real person.  The other characters are handled in a similar way.  So the relationships between them never catch fire.  Emily Blunt is gorgeous to look at and does her best.  All of the actors try, but there isn't much emotional leeway for them to work with.  The result is that it seems very contrived and predictable.  There is a nice sense of promoting Ango-Yemeni relations here, and some equating of fishing with faith and religion.  And the beauty of the desert scenes is undeniable. But the sudden reversals and surprises that dot the last half-hour of the film just feel manufactured, so that we get our feel-good ending.
B00B5A9FLY|4.0|What can I say other than to agree with some of the other reviews I've read. I really enjoyed seasons 1-4, but feel that we lost a season somewhere?!?<br />SPOILER ALERTS<br /> I really didn't care much for the final 3 or 4 episodes of season 5, like I said it seems something is missing, there should have been a season where Merlin finally told Arthur about his magic and during that season it could have been based around Merlin learning more about his powers and abilities and Arthur finally realizing how much of a friend Merlin was to him and then going out to find him again, similar to when Gwen was banned, but returned once Arthur realized how much he loved her. Instead what we get is Arthur does not learn of Merlin's abilities until it's too late to appreciate them. Arthur only learns of them after he has been fatally wounded by Mordred. It seemed in this season that everything was rushed, things happened too quickly unlike the beginning where it set a decent pace.<br />Other than my complaints above, overall I enjoyed Merlin, it was a good show.<br />I do recommend it to others because you don't see many series' like this anymore, it would have been perfect if it would have had a different final season.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Just what I needed! Recommend it to everyone who has a Kindle. I write on my cords what they are for. Helps keep them with the right product.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I would never have believed that this was a self-published work if I hadn't read this detail before purchasing the Kindle version.  This contained none of the horrible errors so frequently found in something self-published.  Besides being grateful to the author for this, the book was just FANTASTIC.  Agreed...it was a \\"lighter read\\" than most hardcore SF, but it took a great imagination to construct the human ant farm that is the silo world, and while the concept of rebellion being punishable by death isn't a new one, the author's creativity puts a wonderful spin on an old theme.  I read criticisms that the characters weren't terribly complex, but perhaps that's because they were bred not to be; life has purpose within the silo and there isn't a lot of room for individuality, after all.<br /><br />I enjoyed the amazing kick-butt heroine most of all.  She spent more time holding her breath than most free-divers, and I held my breath right along with her.<br /><br />I can't wait to find out how the silos got there and what the other microcosms hold.  And yes, this has GREAT movie potential...
1451695195|4.0|After my wife died about 11 years ago, I became obsessed with reading about NDEs, consciousness, and anything that supported a view that we might have life after life. My attempt to deal with all of this, and the huge emotional impact of losing Vickie, is discussed in my book [[ASIN:B00C0EJNQ6 I Know You're Dead, But I Still Worry About You]].<br /><br />The thing that turned me negative on NDE then, and that still does so, even though this is the first such book I've read in years, is how the authors claim to \\"see\\" God, Heaven, Deceased Family Members, interestingly different space-time configurations, etc, without eyes. Supposedly their consciousness goes roaming around the galaxy and beyond, and \\"sees\\" everything that it comes across. If consciousness has this ability, then why do we humans bother with having eyes. The same can be said of hearing and of communicating ... interesting that even with a dead brain, NDE'ers can \\"communicate\\" with God and all the peoples and characters of the world the NDE's consciousness is visiting. Oh, and when \\"they come back to life,\\" all of that stuff that their consciousness encountered and Understood is conveniently stored in their memory. Not at all clear to me how you can store memories in a dead brain.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander's case is even worse than most in this regard, because he INSISTS that he was really, really dead, and that he didn't even have a \\"self\\" to journey through the land of oz he visited ... only a generic self. Yet, he has memories of the \\"event.\\"<br /><br />Who wouldn't like to believe Dr. Alexander? I would be Greatly comforted if I could truly believe, for any decent length of time, that her consciousness or her soul still exists and is happy. Dr. Alexander's book didn't really give me any reason to believe that this is the case.<br /><br />Having poured all that negativity out, let me add that I would love to see a theory of consciousness that makes survival of death, in some form, meaningful. Despitemy negative tone, I am open to the possibility that we can live on. I am currently reading Thomas Nagel's \\"Mind and Cosmos\\" and have some sympathy with his arguments that the mind cannot be explained via the physical (the brain). Keith Ward makes an even more convincing case in his \\"More Than Matter?\\" So, I remain open, and reading Dr. Alexander's story was not a waste, but it also did nothing to advance the dialog in this area.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I found this gem of an artist by accident, as I am a big Kate Miller-Heidke fan. She sings a duet on the previous Passenger album, Flight of the Crow (another excellent album.) I was a bit disappointed not to find the song on the CD I ordered, but listened to it as I was driving, and the songs quickly grew on me.  On the third listen to the album, I found myself looking for all of his previous works, to find more from him, and the Kate duet.  I am stunned by the beauty of this album. It is not only the unique voice, and the funny but relatable lyrics, it is the combination of the voice, music and lyrics that simply works together better than any album I have discovered by accident before.  I recommend this to anyone who likes meaningful lyrics, great music and has a sense of humor.  Everyone I have played this for has fallen in love with it as well.

B008OOYALE|5.0|I started five wargames around the same time as this.  After ten days, I've quit four of them and started playing Dragon Story on my Kindle as well as my phone.<br /><br />Dragon Story starts off quick enough to get you into the game, then settles down to a more leisurely pace.  You can stay active or just check in a couple times a day.  You build habitats for dragons, who then provide an income in coins.  You use coins to grow food or build things, and the dragons grow and provide more income.  The best part of it is cross-breeding dragons to produce new and rarer kinds.  The quests aren't as good as some games in laying out the best way to play early on, but they are a good source of coins for your first few days.  The art is interesting and the rarer dragons give a real sense of achievement.  You move from baby dragons of simple design to Epic level dragons which would look great on a kids wall on a poster, or on a t-shirt.  Check out the Dragon Story wiki to find out what your egg will hatch to be, and to see what dragons you can breed.<br /><br />Like any free game, there are ways to pay for faster advancement.  Unlike wargames, the spur to advance doesn't come from people who may have spent real money and certainly spend more time.  Unlike most builders, the currency (gold bars) to speed things up is freely available by gifting to friends and getting gifts back.  There's also no compulsion to play, come back in a week and you haven't lost anything, no crops rotting in the field.<br /><br />The game isn't perfect.  If you try to give more than three gifts, it seems to allow you to do so, and the message you get makes it sound as though some friends already got too many gifts.  The reality is you can only give to three friends, others are dropped.  Later in the game the cost to clear foliage can make that part of the game tedious.  You need \\"maps\\" to get permission to clear the plants growing in a square, this can require a dozen friends to answer your request for maps. Then costs to clear individual trees or rocks is quite high (you might have to harvest all your habitats - when they are full of coins - six or eight times).  I suspect this is a big part of people leaving the game or reducing their involvement to checking in every now and then.  On the KindleHD 8.9\\", the furthest you can zoom out is still far closer than on the phone.  Which makes for an odd experience, a huge viewing area focused on a very small part of the map (when the game loads it is at a good zoom level, but as soon as you zoom in, or feed a dragon, you're stuck zoomed in and only rebooting the Kindle fixes that, for a couple minutes).<br /><br />Dragon Story is great to play with your friends (or kids).  It's stress-free, interesting and there is a good pace of progress.  Like any game in this genre you'll eventually tire of it, but that will happen in weeks, not just the few days that most games last.or maps.

B00992CF6W|5.0|That this is an amazing game. I am a Minecraft computer nerd and this still needs some new add ons but its getting there. Good Jobb Mojang. You really outdid yourselves this time.
B007HO392S|5.0|The entire CD is A+.. a great listen. recomend to all music lovers; not just country<br />awesome sing-along cd..sit back and enjoy!
B0000640VO|5.0|I gave this product 5 stars because I honestly love this movie! It's a feel good movie that keeps you entertained the whole time through. It has love, adventure, and a little bit of mystery- all perfectly combined. It's a French movie that comes with English and Spanish subtitles along with a bunch of other extras. I recommend this to fans of unique films from professional critics to anyone who can appreciate a great work. A movie you won't easily forget!
B008602KQI|4.0|Really enjoyed this adaptation of the book. Jennifer Lawrence and the other actors truly make you care about Katniss and Peeta as they try and win the Hunger Games.  It is an entertaining and enjoyable story of good triumphing over evil.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I was able to download quilting videos and they play perfectly.  I will use this app while traveling and waiting at appoinments.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good story of a young women's struggle to overcome adversity and evil. Moves quickly without sacrificing substance. A book worth reading.

B007IK44CK|4.0|Really enjoyed it as each MI movie has gotten better as the series progresses. The opening sequence gets you started in a great way and the movie never disappoints.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|There were ups and downs w/the overall story, much as in life, but by the end it is memorable, thoughtful, enlightening and a book you are proud to endorse. It seems these are qualities not often found in one book very often. I honestly rejoice when I find a book, as w/this one, to read and pass on to my  daughters and friends, w/out reservation.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Nice use of all the functionality of the device. I would have liked branching gameplay and more complex puzzles that can be approached in multiple ways, but that's just my preference. Worth the price.

Why do you have to be so effing serious all the time? You should learn to how to take a joke.\\"<br />  \\"I can take a joke,\\" she tells me, sounding insulted.<br />  \\"Yeah? When?\\"<br />  \\"When it's not being delivered by a childish jacka** who thinks he's God's gift to women.\\"<br />Kate does things to Drew as to where he forgets or purposely doesn't do s***, \\"I didn't lock my car. I don't think I even closed the door. Eff it. They can steal it. I have more important matters at hand.\\" I bet you do buddy. I like Drew's sister, \\"I distinctly remember changing your diaper and seeing those cute little guys hanging there. What happened to them? Did they shrink? Disappear? Because that's the only reason I can think of to explain why you would behave like such a pathetic no-balls coward.\\" Drew is such a nice uncle teaching his niece the finer things in life, \\"Johnny Fitzgerald is an idiot. Vaginas beat penises every time. They're like kryptonite. Penises are defenseless against them.\\"
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|That was a amazing book!!!<br />I liked this book because I liked hearing the story from different kids perspectives and I liked how Jack stood up for Auggie.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|My husband and I, along with two close friends of ours, went to see this when it was newly out at the movies. It was a sweet, romantic, funny, sexy, and became a favorite of all of us.[[ASIN:B00005K3OT Chocolat (Miramax Collector's Series)]]
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Pardon me if I disagree with some of you, but in regard to STAR TREK: THE ORIGINAL SERIES, for me the difference between regular DVD and blu-ray high definition was not only big, it was critical.<br /><br />I was eighteen when STAR TREK debuted in the fall of 1966, and I have seen every episode so many times I have lost count. The last time, a few years ago, STAR TREK: THE ORIGINAL SERIES rewarded me with a tolerable though not especially uplifting experience on regular DVD. Grainy cinematography, antiquated special effects, antiquated computer technology, antiquated acting...everything was just too doggone OLD. Believing that I would never again want to watch the original series, I sold my set to a second-hand store. Even after the entire series had been released on blu-ray, I was not interested. Initially.<br /><br />But with the recent blu-ray releases of the first season of ENTERPRISE and more blu-ray releases of NEXT GENERATION, I took a peek at some recent reviews for the original series. Looking only at the ones for the blu-ray releases, they were almost all commendatory. Some were well written, in polished prose and without ostentatious language. I respect that, and the reviewers conveyed truthfulness. But for the original series? That threadbare thing that only sentimentalists and fanatics deem praiseworthy? The reviews were hard to believe.<br /><br />Nevertheless, they persuaded me to buy the complete original series in blu-ray.<br /><br />Indeed! The laudatory reviews were justified. It was like watching the original series for the first time. Everything was so impressive I felt like giving my screen a hug. Enhanced sequences that show the ENTERPRISE orbiting alien worlds are cinematically state-of-the-art. And even though the sets are still made of papier-mache boulders and the computer technology is ancient, they become tolerable because the bright colors, sharp resolution, and digital sound elevate everything to a higher level of life. This creates deeper immersion, which incredibly enough seems even to have improved the acting.<br /><br />At least for me, STAR TREK has been resurrected.eper immersion, which incredibly enough seems even to have improved the acting.<br /><br />At least for me, STAR TREK has been resurrected.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|Accidentally ordered this and now don't know how to delete it from my Kindle.  It requires a commitment I do not want to give.
B007KCG7MQ|2.0|His previous album was much better.  No, I can't remember the name, but maybe that's why my gut tells me it's better.  Others may love it, but nothing ever seems to come close to his 70's hit that has the lyric &#34;I'm falling down&#34;.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I love the vivid color of purple and the black strap.  It is very easy to take care of and doesn't require much attention. However I am disappointed this particular case does not have anywhere to hold a stylus. Size is perfect for carrying everywhere.

B007LNJ4YW|5.0|Anything I say about this album will be unsatisfying to me because this music touches places that I cannot explain. We like to think we know who we are and what we are doing, and yet I suspect that beneath the surface we all harbor secret love, regret and hope. The music from Bloom speaks directly to things beneath our surfaces. But Bloom does not merely speak, it seduces and convinces us that our feelings are being expressed in the music. We remember, soar or weep when the music turns in a particular direction. If you have some empathy for this music, you will be taken on a journey to nostalgic places full of love. It is romantic and heart felt.<br />My favorite tracks from this album are Myth, Lazuli, Wishes and On The Sea, but I am not sure. I think I can change my mind every time I listen to Bloom. I am listening to \\"Irene\\" as I write this and I am utterly transformed. So slow, so slowly this music moves me. And how often can I say that I am moved by any form of art? Hardly ever. Each song in Bloom is absolutely necessary to its completion. If I could give it six stars, I would.
B0094KTCUQ|5.0|This is one of my most recent favorites. This animation is geared towards the older children and adults. Just not entertaining to a two year old.
0671449028|5.0|We love all of the Sandra Boynton books we have gotten. This is a great book that is fun for bedtime. The story doesn't make a lot of sense (who takes a bath, gets dressed for bed, and *then* goes and works out?) at times, but kids aren't concerned with such trivial things.
B008D563IC|5.0|I am a HUGE American Pie lover and this by far is my favorite!!  I highly recommend that if you have not seen this you need to!  It is absolutely hilarious!!!!!!!!!
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|I'm not sorry I watched the film but I'm glad I rented it and did not buy the film. I think watching the movie is worth the time and rental but there are much better gangster films out there

B007TKT2SK|5.0|This App is great. It even automatically converts answers into decimals.<br />For the 1 star review who is angered by technology; I was an honors AP student [who excelled at math] 35 years ago. I know how to do this stuff, but why bother? This does it for you and is set up so simply, a third grader can see if they get it right with ease [without asking others {who might not get it correct either}]. I tested it out, and it hasn't failed me yet, being correct in every instance.<br />Since being retired, I use my math skills when I volunteer doing home improvements after disasters. This will not make a mistake [unlike humans], and you don't have to redo your math twice to check your work. It will save you time and money [both for labor and materials if you have an error in your calculations]. The way it's set up even saves you time.<br />They say to: Measure twice, cut once. It should be updated to: Use this app to calculate your measurement, THEN measure twice and cut once.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I was looking for a RomCom and this was not it. It was well written, but not a book I would choose to read again.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was better than the 1st Book.  It was a real page turner and I couldn't get enough.  I''m glad I had the third book so I can just move along.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I haven't seen any other app do this or any calculator actually. Get the app if converting fractions to decimals is too much of a laborious for you.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was a fitting end to one of the defining fantasy sagas of our time. I find myself saddened at the thought that there will not be any more, yet, I hold out hope that there could somehow be more tales to tell of these characters that I have come to know over such a significant portion of my life.<br /><br />Thank you Robert Jordan, may you ride on the winds of time!<br /><br />And thank you, Brandon Sanderson for helping this story be what it became. I've read all of the books except AMOL at least twice, and will reread the, again! I wish you the best of success and will continue to follow our work!
0385349947|5.0|This book really resonated with me!  I've been leaning in all my life. I's been interesting, frustrating, and very lonely at times. This book explains why, and encourages me to keep going, and to ask for more in return.  Women do pay a penalty because of the deep cultural biases that cause people--men and women alike--to push women down when they lead, creating a dearth of women in top leadership positions despite great gains in educational achievement, experience and business success.

B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Very addictive game. Chomping away on the fish and scuba divers is loads of fun.  Discovered the flying fish by accident - awesome!  Would give it 5 stars if you didn't have to start every round from scratch.  How about some different starting points? And I wish we didn't have to put out real money for the upgrades.  Take a clue from Jurassic Park Builder game - just accumulate enough points and upgrades are earned.  Otherwise a fun waste of time.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|At first I thought it would be hard to get into this book since it is told from the perspective of a 5 year old. However, once I got adjusted to how it is written, I had a hard time putting it down. Yes, it is an intense overall story, most people will take a look at this book and think it's going to be too emotionally intense, but since it is told from the little kids point of view, there really isn't anything too graphic or terrifying to read. You know what is going on, but it is told in a very light way. The second half of the book is even better than the first (can't say too much without giving it away), viewing the world from this little boy's point of view who only knows a &#34;room&#34; as his world, is very interesting. I highly recommend this book.

It's not just a case.  It actually keeps your bluetooth continually charged while you have it in the case.  The only mystery is, why don't I need to charge the case yet???  I've been using this for well over two weeks on a single charge!  Crazy...but true!

B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife was bought to go in my Bug out Bag. I have no doubt that it will hold up very well to whatever abuse is thrown at it. This isn't an average knife you carry with you for hunting or hiking. It's pretty much made specifically for serious situations out in the bush. I feel safe in saying that it will deliver when needed.<br /><br />The overall quality, feel and workmanship is very good. Money well spent...

B008I43DYU|1.0|It does NOT work on HTC One X+ ... the display is too large, regardless of whether it's in portrait or landscape, where only 1 or 2 rows are visible (i.e. cannot do any calculation because not all the button are accessible). The whole app is not functional, and therefore, USELESS!

B007THA4FI|3.0|The antics of the shallow, unsympathetic and dismissable chartacters in this book just lurch along, with little ultimate redemption. The only interesting character in the book was the deceased main character, who may only have been interesting because he had no boring, shapeless inner monologue. Much of the book was painful to read, but not in a way that enhanced understanding of your fellow man. It just made me thankful that I do not live in a small town in England, perhaps.
0765342294|5.0|Book arrived on time and in better condition than I expected. I paid 0.99$ for an entire novel, and a well known one at that. Couldn't have been a more painless or simple process. Great work, guys!
B007TKT2SK|1.0|If you're looking for an app that makes it easy to calculate fractions and convert fractions to decimals, then this is it. But this app has some serious shortcomings and the negatives far outweigh the benefits so I can't rate this higher than one star and I advise against installing this application.<br /><br />The most glaring omission is that this \\"calculator\\" lacks a decimal button. This is probably the only calculator in the world that doesn't have a decimal button. Yes, I know that this is a \\"fraction calculator\\" but there is no excuse for not allowing people to enter decimals. For instance, if you want to calculate 1.364 x 1 1/3 you can't do that very easily. You have to enter 1 364/1000 x 1 1/3. It's kind of a pain in the behind.<br /><br />There is also no memory. There's no excuse for not including the ability to save a number to memory. All but the most rudimentary calculators have a memory store (at least one).<br /><br />My next gripe is that there are no parenthesis for use in formulas. You might not expect to find parenthesis in a very basic calculator, but many calculators have parenthesis, including lots of free calculators. Even the stock Android calculator in easy mode has parenthesis.<br /><br />My final gripe is the size of this application. Amazon lists this ia 9.7MB but according to my phone's application manager it is 12.82MB WHAT??? Are you kidding me??? NeoCal (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S3MB2U/tag=usps04-20) is only 1.72MB and Office Calculator Pro (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TI1WME/tag=usps04-20) is only 812KB. The stock Android calculator application is only 8KB. These calculators are far, far, far, FAR more advanced than Fraction Calculator Pro and are a fraction of the size (pun semi-intended). Why in the world does such a basic application as Fraction Calculator Plus require nearly 13MB of storage? Thanks, but no thanks. I have loads of very advanced applications that do lots of things and have tons of graphics thatare much smaller in size than this calculator application.<br /><br />One more oddity is that this application inexplicably requires Internet access. This is bewildering. Why does a VERY basic calculator with no ads require Internet access? I suspect that 13MB of application size is up to no good. The developer should tell us what this calculator is doing over the Internet.<br /><br />I attribute the lack of perenthesis and memory to laziness by the developer. I attribute the massive size of the application to poor software development skills. And I attribute the lack of a decimal key to insanity. I don't know what to attribute the need for Internet access to but it is troubling. There is no excuse for all these problems in a paid calculator app. The lack of a decimal key is particularly frustrating because you will always need a second calculator to use for any calculation involving decimals. This app can't replace your existing calculator, it just adds serious bloat to your device. Just use Google to calculate your fractions. For instance if you enter \\"1 2/3 x 5.111\\" into Google's search bar, Google will return 8.51833333333. Why can't a paid fraction calculator do the same basic math?<br /><br />Even if you are getting this application as the free app of the day (5/20/13), there is no need to clog your device up with such a basic app that sucks nearly 13MB of storage when you can accomplish the same things and more using the Google search bar.
B00ATSS73U|5.0|Great collaboration between Darlene Zschech and Israel Houghton. You know how some albums only have a few nice songs? I loved all the songs in this album even though there were quite a few re-mixes.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|It was fabulous and a far superior production to the newly released version.  It relied on good acting and a good story, based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, rather than over-the-top special effects seen in the new production.

B000002KDS|5.0|Alice Cooper, the man and the band, released its fourth studio album Killer in November of 1971.<br />By the time of Killer, Alice Cooper had a Top 40 album with Love it to Death and a hit with \\"I'm Eighteen\\" so the pressure was on lead singer Vincent Furnier (a/k/a Alice Cooper), guitarist (the sadly missed) Glen Buxton, drummer Neal Smith, bass player Dennis Dunaway and guitarist Michael Bruce to deliver an album tthat would make Alice rock legends or a one-hit wonder. Read on and find out, as I did when I first got the cassette tape on October 6, 1989 (almost two months after I discovered Alice on In the Studio which spotlighted Billion Dollar Babies and had his 1974 Greatest Hits album) and I now own on CD.<br />We begin with the classic hit \\"Under My Wheels\\" which was a massive bluesy hard rocker. Buxton and Bruce chug out the riff superbly. Also, this was the first Alice Cooper track to feature a horn section and an uncredited appearance by Rick Derringer who played the lead solos on the track. Next is another rocker called \\"Be My Lover\\". The track is somewhat of an autobiographical nature of a groupie who falls for the band. Next is the classic eight minute-plus epic called \\"Halo Of Flies\\". This track was the band's arguable masterwork pre-1973. We end the first half with the piece called \\"Desperado\\". The track was about gunfights in the old west and was written in tribute to fallen Doors frontman, Jim Morrison, who had passed away earlier in 1971. Great piece and was also the first Alice track to use an orchestra. In some parts of the track, Cooper's voice even resembles Morrison's!<br />The album's second half starts with the proto-type punk number called \\"You Drive Me Nervous\\" which was a great number. Then it's another great rocker called \\"Yeah Yeah Yeah\\" which is not a tribute to The Beatles but a classic Cooper track. Next is one of the first rock songs to tackle child abuse called \\"Dead Babies\\". This excellent rocker may not have been liked by many parents but it helped expose the child neglect/abuse problem (just like what went on with Britney Spears and her neglect to her own kids and other families across the US and the world). This track is just stellar. Court disorder from \\"Dead Babies\\"' finale segues into the closing seven minute title cut. This piece starts out as a typical Alice Cooper rocker about a killer before it goes into different tempos and key changes. Then a death march begins and then the weird sounds at album's end is the killer's execution.<br />Killer rightfully reached #21 on the Billboard album chart and became his first Gold selling album in a quick span of time (today it is Platinum in US sales). Killer is one of the quintessential hard rock/metal albums along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath's first four albums, Deep Purple's In Rock and Machine Head and many others!<br />Recommended!ents but it helped expose the child neglect/abuse problem (just like what went on with Britney Spears and her neglect to her own kids and other families across the US and the world).

B0057URWSQ|5.0|Not sure why I decided to check out this series with so many Court room based shows out there that I do my best to avoid, however, Suits is a sensational series. It is fun to watch a program that when you're done watching you actually feel good and maybe a little smarter. All of the characters work so well together and the main two knock it out of the park. Five stars to the writers and cast.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|What else can be said about the only relevant music event of the past decade that has not already been said? You will find that I will agree with everyone else that the performance by the reformed Led Zeppelin on 'Celebration Day' was without a doubt the best live performance by anyone in hard rock/heavy metal in a very long time. I will provide a little more critique, then focus on the product which we all got to watch this reunion, one-off performance.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this is your father's, or perhaps your grandfather's, Led Zeppelin: And That's A Good Thing. Realistically, no Zeppelin performance now and potentially in the future will ever be close to their raw youth or unmatchable world-ruling prime. That being said, the concert proved if they got together again with Jason Bonham on drums and recorded all brand new material they could rule the world one more time. Jason did a fantastic job on the drums, improvising the beats to make them his own. Jimmy Page may not have been sharp, perhaps given the broken finger he suffered that affected the original concert date, but he still played his heart out. John Paul Jones still can do no wrong in whatever he does and whatever he plays: just a pure musician. And Robert Plant, unlike singers Mick Jagger and Brian Johnson, did sing to his current ability. Overall, their chemistry was perfect, and they didn't overplay anything in the live concert.<br /><br />Now for the DVD/CD. The five star rating is for the music only, for director Dick Carruthers did a terrible job with filming and editing the concert. There were few, but clear, shots of the band members sharing intimate stage moments, but they get lost by cut aways and one second blurs. We all get it was a monumental event, but it was treated as one long MTV music video.<br /><br />The second DVD features the rehearsal for the concert. Now this was a treat to see because it showed how serious they were treating this concert, playing the whole set, working out the kinks, trying different things out. Not too many people realize that the best bands in the world still do this, everyday, on tour. Not only that, it gives us fans a DVD of a different sounding concert, much like different versions of songs found on the 'BBC Sessions'. Other than the rehearsal is the media coverage of the O2 event, and the 'Pulse' media coverage used at the beginning of the concert.<br /><br />The 2-disk CDs were a little disappointing sound wise -- just a little. The volume on Plant's vocals were a little low compared to the instruments and somewhat echoing. However, the CDs cut the filler between some of the songs seen in the concert. The music is good, is just when I'm on my computer I put the DVD in because the sound on it is so much better.

B005MLOKXA|1.0|What started out in season one to be an interesting journey, hopped off of the track and cruised on down the course of partisan self-righteousness and a churning of partisan passion into anger against sideshow political points unconnected to the actual plot. I miss the fun and am not watching anymore.
0880794968|5.0|THE deck for tarot, i would agree.<br />I really like the coloring on these cards, think its nicer than the<br />standard deck.<br />Deck comes with instruction booklet with meanings, both upright<br />and reversal. which can get you started.<br />back of cards is dark blue with stars all over.<br />The feel of the deck is good, plastic coated, not as stiff as some playing cards can be.<br />Overall great deck and i would recommend
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle is one of my favorite tv shows! I missed out on the first couple of seasons and when I saw them on Amazon I was thrilled! If you want a good mystery/with Castle being comical....this is it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|All three books in the trilogy are fairly easy reads. While I don't want to give away any spoilers, I will say that I was slightly disappointed with certain elements of the ending. Some of the ideas felt either forced, slightly out of character or too convenient. But overall, I still enjoyed the book thoroughly.
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|Not only does Walk Off the Earth offer up some amazing covers with interesting twists and unique instruments, they also have an amazing talent for writing, performing and evoking emotions from their listeners. I am sick and tired of hearing the same kind of music on the radio but sung by different people (who coincidentally all sound the same...) Instead WOKE is new, different and they are revolutionizing their unique blend of singers and musicians to be modern and interesting to listen to.<br />I swear one day all I listened to was &#34;Gang of Rhythm&#34; because it made me want to dance around and go to the beach and just have fun.  I love how uniquely quirky and different they are and I am glad they are finally achieving the much deserved fame that had been lacking before this point.<br /><br />Please do yourself a favor and listen to their youtube channel if you don't believe me, or just want to sample their sound. It is so natural and amazing there is no real way to describe their immense ability to make others enjoy the music that they are having the time of their lives maing.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Make more like this, if each room is as fast &amp; fun u could put a hotel up giving the option for so many new rooms. U r on the right path with this game. At least with us puzzle playing people.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't see why it a 4.5 star game. It should be a 5 star game. But it great on the second generation kindle. When the rest of the updates come out it will be awesome! Well I hope you get it.
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I rate it a one star because it was a prolonged, painful journey reading about every stupid decision this woman made, every awful step she took on this journey when she hadn't trained for it, and every blister she suffered because she had the wrong size of boots. I have never hated a book as much as this one and I am terribly disappointed that my book club chose it.  There certainly must  be many other books that deserve reading...something interesting besides one's immature outbreaks.

B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Rodrick Rules was one of the best books I had ever read. It's about a boy named Greg Heffly who has to deal with is older brother Rodrick. I'd recommend this book to kids 7 and up or people who like funny stories.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I had the opportunity to pick this title up free for my Kindle as a promotion from Amazon. It's a first for me from Mira Lyn Kelly and I found it to be fun. Megan may have had a few too many drinks last night. Waking up next to Connor who reintroduces himself as her husband confirms that. Megan has had some pretty bad luck with relationships so she had planned to visit a fertility clinic because she really wanted to be a mom. Connor wanted a family, he just didn't want to fall in love. So when they meet at a bar in Vegas after a few drinks they decide that they are the perfect solution to what the other desires. But as they start to discover more and more about each other they realize that maybe a marriage based just on a business transactions isn't what they want. Falling in love wasn't in the plan but maybe their plans change. This was a fun, sweet story. I enjoyed both Megan and Connor. They was had some character quirks that maybe got a little on my nerves but then they both worked on them and they improved. Finished on a high note for me, great read!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great App. It is perfect for on the go and it works well for everyday reading as well as when I just need to look up something quickly. It is the only Bible App I will ever need.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|In a pinch it's nice to have in your pack, but I'm not going to rely on this to sharpen my good knives unless I'm out in the middle of nowhere.  A good whetstone or diamond sharpener would be better for at home.
B006WB7IN8|4.0|Very good read.  The going forward and backward in time takes a bit of getting used to but it keeps the story moving along.  only 4 stars as parts of a bit far fetched but it doesn't take from the story.  If you can't handle domestic violance situtations then this book if not for you as the scenes can be very graphic but it does make you please the story more
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's a pretty cute game. Wish everything didn't cost so many coins but like all apps there's in game purchase which I did LOL... I'll punch myself later for being impatient and spending real money on yet another app...passing the time....still fun though :)
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have enjoyed James Bond movies ever since I was a teenager in the 1960s.  “Skyfall” was no exception, but I have several criticisms.  Much of the action was over the top.  Even though Daniel Craig is in awesome physical condition, the human body cannot take such punishment and still perform at such high levels.  I also thought that the spy trade-craft was often unrealistic.  I should have followed the sage advice of a former student who once advised me to park my brain at the door and just enjoy the movie.
B00498YZH8|5.0|We rewatched this after seeing Jennifer Lawrence in Silver Linings Playbook and Hungar Games. She's amazing. All the characters were well played. It's a grueling story but seemed believable<br />Unfortunately.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Having only a vague idea as to the plot of Victor Hugo’s “Les Misérables,” I found the movie of the musical based on his novel a bit difficult to follow.  I finally took a break and read a synopsis on-line.  The movie was then much more interesting.  Afterwards, I view and thoroughly enjoyed the bonus features which did much to explain the casting and provide insights into the life of Hugo.  I now wish that I had viewed those features and familiarized myself with the story line first.  I would then have given a five-star rating.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I can't say enough good about Max Brooks World War Z. It is absolutely fantastic. These last words are just to fill the requirement.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|In preparation for watching the movie, I reread “The Hobbit” after a lapse of 50 years.  Doing so was probably a mistake because during the movie I kept wondering where all the extra action was coming from and why the movie ended with a different conclusion than the novel.  I also gained the impression that the producers were going to herculean efforts to stretch a trilogy out of a fairly slim novel.  A friend who knows much more about Tolkien’s Middle-Earth than I do informed me that the movie included numerous elements from the “The Silmarillion” which I then slogged my way through.  Did I miss an announcement to that effect by the producers of the movie?
B00BBW16HW|5.0|such a feel good movie.. very cute and fun and great for a rainy day in the house. wonderful acting!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good and well-written book, definitely keeps you reading.  Tough subject matter, but a good read.  I would recommend this book.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Not often that, by season five, the safe and mundane factor in.  Not with Mad Men - Episodes 3 and 4 are up there amongst the best.  Mad Men fans will not be disappointed.  Highly recommended.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|NO SPOILERS HERE!!!!<br /><br />Pros<br />-Awesome CGI and action sequences.<br />-Really solid acting by everyone. Pine and Quinto do a fantastic job playing Kirk and Spock respectively. Cumberbatch will make you wish the movie was an hour longer just so you can listen to him speak.<br />-Solid story line. Hardcore Trekies might hate one particular twist but, hey, haters gonna hate<br />-Well placed jokes! Hard to do in an action movie but the writers and actors did a great job here.<br />-See it on a big screen!!! The whole movie is &#34;big&#34; which is hard to describe. I saw it in IMAX and, honestly, this is one of the few films that takes advantage of the potential of that format.<br /><br />Cons<br />-One cheesy scene... just a minor blemish.<br />-Not a huge fan of the guy playing bones. A bit too corny IMO
B008RNGCAO|5.0|Give a better understanding of the rise and fall of Bane, and remind you how human Batman really is, and that he is still a human afterall.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Awesome movie, brings back good memories of growing up..Also now that I have kids they have falling in love with this movie.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love the movie, not a fan of some of the changes from the book, will be interested in how they edit the next movie!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Having the contact points connected by magnets versus the USB cable is big.  USB ports tend to wear over time. The tablet just charges slow.  This cable makes it a bit better, but this tablet charges a lot slower than my ASUS TF300T I upgraded from. The cable helps the tablet charge faster than the USB cord, but it's still relatively slow.  That isn't the cable's fault obviously.<br /><br />In any event great product!  I think the magnetic connection is something that should catch on with other devices.  If you trip over the cord the connection breaks away safely.
B00CTT9646|5.0|I loved this movie! It was better then the first (in my opinion. Good story. Great character development. Perfect casting. On point acting. Unexpected surprises. ALL THE FEELS!
B00008G9JM|5.0|It was one of the best Tull concerts I've ever seen. And each time I listen to this disc, I'm right back there. Is that a... phone...ringing...???
B0076DELIG|4.0|Typical Bosch story.  Not too deep or intriguing but entertaining. Easy character development. Much like a romance novel for the cop genres.
193700788X|5.0|We all knew from the beginning that Sookie & Eric would not end up together & I'm good with that. I like Sam and I think they will be happy together. Her life was way too chaotic ( read brutal) when she was with the vampires and I don't know about everyone else, but that is not a life I would like to lead forever! Seriously, she been so....lucky with everything she's been through to still be alive and whole!<br /><br />Sookie got to sew some amazing oats (Bill, Quinn & Eric) and now gets to settle down (hopefully) with a really great man. She may even get to have serveral months without being beat up or kidnapped! Eric will be fine and I think it was awesome that he took care of all of his people, including Sookie, before moving on. Let's all be honest too, who really thought that Eric wouldn't end up turning her even though she's said repeatedly that she doesn't want it?! Would that turning be for him or her? Hmmm....<br /><br />Sookie's a great character! She's a strong decisive woman who has had to make some really tough, fast decisions. She has gotten dragged into some horrific situations through the utter selfishness of the 'Supes' around her all trying to use her (including Eric) for there own self centered reasons. No one but Sam has been there for her without ever having used her. Bill is great now, but we all know how it began.<br /><br />Sookie is a aware of something we should all embrace, SHE is responsible for her own happiness. She has to make it happen, not anyone else. People can add to it and help, but she is/was surrounded by people who wanted to take and use vs add and enhance and good for her for not putting up with it anymore!<br /><br />Honestly, what has she gotten (positive, without strings) from knowing any of the Supes?  She already had Sam, Bill's a keeper (now), Amelia's iffy, Niall knew where she was without help and the others just brought pain and drama for their own purpose, none for her. Yes, some vampires and shifters helped her, but she wouldn't have needed it if it weren't  for one group or another in the 1st place! She helped and gave waaay more than she ever received from all of the Supes and deserves peace, happiness, good health and maybe even a statue.<br /><br />Charlaine, thanks for giving us an amazing series with an incredibly strong heroine and letting her be happy at the conclusion! I appreciate your time and effort. Ooh and thanks so vey much for the wrap up book coming in October! I think that every author should be REQUIRED to do this at the end of a series!
B009H7SCMA|5.0|Allan Hardy's novel \\"Gabriella\\" is a great read if you can stand the heat. I found myself switching from laughing out loud and saying \\"OMG\\", but I couldn't put it down. Gabriella is definitely a naughty girl who knows what she wants and she wants \\"it\\" a lot! After reading, \\"Gabriella\\", I am firmly convinced that blonds really do have more fun. Allan Hardy is to be commended on a superb novel. The characters are believable, the dialogue right on, and the \\"action\\" will keep the pages flipping.
B00499K9E0|5.0|Even though I am a long time fan of Robert Downey Jr., I have to say that Benedict Cumberbatch is a far better Holmes, and this terrific BBC series puts the American film franchise to shame.  So interesting and engaging that it is actually hard to look away from the screen...Watch the season one opener \\"The Pink Lady\\" and see if I\\"m wrong.  Brilliant, beautifully shot and a seriously great time.  Why can't we get television this good in the states?  Thank God for Amazon Prime, my Kindle Fire and the BBC!

B005LAIHSG|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty good, although Kristen Stewart needs to take acting lessons.  She has the same expressions whether she is mad, shocked, or scared.  Other than that the movie wasn't bad.

B00BI73CVI|3.0|This was nothing like a true musical production, imo.<br />I was expecting several, memorable musical productions interspersed with dialogue.<br />Instead, I got mediocre singing of dialogue for the entire +2.5 hrs..<br />Anne Hathaway did do a good job, but she was only in the movie for a portion of time.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Puzzles were outstanding, difficult without being overly frustrating. Gameplay and graphics  were spectacular. The only thing I would like to see in the next one is longer play time.
B0053TMP24|5.0|The Son of Neptune was an amazing book and I can't wait to read about Percy Jackson's next adventure with his friends in the Mark of Athena.
B006ON7XRK|3.0|Eats, shoots, and leaves by Lynne Truss is not a grammar book that I first thought it was. There is no direct lessons on commas and apostrophes. What caught my attention was the back of the book about the panda. But really, there are no pandas related in the book. Her style is very different from what I have read before. She goes off on all these examples and stories that she encounter, making her upset when people uses commas in the wrong place. I was disappointed because I wanted to read this book to improve my grammar. However, Truss barely taught me anything. She rambles on about how she is strict on puncuation, and seeing the slightest mistake gets her furry up. On the bright side, many of the things she said is funny, making the book more enjoyable.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Rick Riordan is an amazing author and it is incredible how he has put more adventures and the life of the demigods into a thrilling new book.

Other wise this game is a whole lot of fun I would play it for hours strait just to try to beat my high score.<br />Just fix the minor problem and I would be exited to give it 5 stars.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I'm thoroughly impressed by The Relax Melodies app.  As mentioned in the title, I wholly believe this collection of melodies is wonderful. It's great for lulling babies to sleep, or to help u sleep while traveling. The natural, visceral sounds help me, an insomniac from way back, remember all the comforting sounds, as a youth in the hills, woods, and pastures of KY in the night time...nights passed in deep sleep. I love that the sounds can be be heard singly or mixed together; u can control the volume of each separately. If u r musically inclined, the screen setup reminds me of a sort of keyboard or sounding board. I believe some lovely mixes for sleeping, meditating, or whatever your pleasure principle - Relax Melodies is a must have application...goodnight ;)

I like the common thread to the stories of who Jack Reacher is but happily they are not serialized.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|Many of the anecdotes around Steve Jobs have been told over and over. Some may even be true. What Isaacson does that's so good is that he weaves them into a narrative that provides a multidimensional view informed by many interviews with Jobs associates, family, and acquaintances over the years. There are times when some particular personality trait gets emphasized a bit too much, but it's a compelling story. I found it hard to put the book down and I'm glad I read it.<br /><br />Increasingly, I find that the Kindle version of books is a bit clumsy for references, pictures, and so on, but that's a complaint beyond this book, specifically.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game! Wonderful graphics, combined with just the right amount of difficulty. If you love puzzles, you'll love this game. The only bad part is that the game ends too soon! I wanted to keep solving the puzzles to uncover the next wonderful surprise!
B00CDCIQX6|2.0|The movie is wonderful.  As a stand-alone, it's fantastic.  However, if you have read and love the book, you will be upset at what has been glossed over, re-imagined, or left out altogether.  First, the idea that Frobisher and Ayers had a [sexual] relationship is utter nonsense.  Where IS Ayers' daughter?  The portrayal of Frobisher as strictly homosexual (and yes, he did make love to Jocasta, but in the movie it is portrayed as merely lust abatement) seriously limits his scope as a character.  He doesn't KNOW what he wants (or who), which makes him that much more of a dynamic character.  Also, what was that bit with him in the china shop?! Totally unnecessary, it didn't advance the plot at all.  Next, the relationship between Sonmi and Hae-Joon is completely wrong.  When he makes love to her (as per the book), she does NOT enjoy it at all.  By playing into the typical woman-falls-for-man stereotype, it again (as was the case with Frobisher) reduces her to nothing more than literary convention.  Where is her time at University?? Where is the character development?  She witnesses Yoona being raped, and she just falls in bed with the first man to look twice at her? Give me a break!  Also, the 'chase scenes' involving Sonmi/Hae-Joon as well as Louisa's are mainly fabrications.  After all, any good action movie needs a chase scene, right? Wrong.  Read the book.  All of the action, none of the cliche.  And what of Zachary's clan and the Koona?  Why is it never explained why the Koona and the Lowlands people have such a deep rivalry?  What of the clans of O'Hawaii? (Sorry, it's been a while since I read the book and I honestly don't feel like looking up all of the spellings of these names.)  Also, the way Zachary's prophecy plays out is completely different.<br /><br />All said and done, if you like the move, YOU'LL LOVE THE BOOK!!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Really? An Oscar for this one and not Winter's Bone? She did a great job, but the story was fairly boring and I kept waiting for there to be some kind of movement or action but it was pretty much the same thing for an hour and a half.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" is a wonderful classic science fiction book that was first published in 1965 (48 years ago).  Unlike most science fiction, this book has withstood the test of time marvelously.  The reason for the difference is that most science fiction tends to have a sharp focus on technology.  \\"Dune\\" focuses on society and people, instead.  There's not much I can add to the 1,560 current reviews.  So, all I'll say about the story is that it's very-well written and interesting (I've read it at least a half a dozen times over the decades) with a well-developed universe, theme, plot, and characters.<br /><br />As for the Kindle edition, I've seen many comments talking about the bad formatting.  Well, the version I read in May 2013 doesn't seem to have those problems.  I saw no actual formatting issues and found (and reported) only nine minor typographical errors.  So, maybe these issues have been fixed.  But, and this is the big one, the outright greed of the publisher is flabbergasting.  Penguin Publishing is selling the Kindle version of this 48 year old book for one penny short of 12 dollars.  Over the years, I've bought many hardback and paperback copies of this book.  I wanted to read it again on my Kindle.  But, there's no way I was going to pay that kind of money to push a few electrons across a wire.  So, I borrowed the Kindle version from my local library.  Sorry, Penguin, but you lost another sale.  Anyway, since I rate this book at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5, I obviously didn't let the pricing affect my thoughts on the book.  If you want the dead-tree version, buy it.  If you want the Kindle version, borrow it until the publisher gets a clue.<br /><br />And to help people find all the books in the original Dune series (i.e., when Frank Herbert was still alive):<br />1.

B005UG542S|5.0|More strong performances for the entire cast. Don't know how suitable this is for younger kids. Mine grew up with the series and were older when it started getting darker. I would think younger kids would find this one particularly scary. Of course, the end was badly done and sappy but many, many reviewers have commented on that.<br /><br />My suggestion... don't read or re-read the final book (or any of the books) before watching one of the movies. I liked almost all of them better on subsequent viewings than on the first when I was comparing them to the books.
B000002ADT|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite jazz CDs. I've had Kind of Blue ever since it was on vinyl, and thoroughly enjoyed it. My CD wouldn't load into my Mac, so I had to get a new one. I'm so glad that I did. The music is awesome.
B000I3W1XS|5.0|Yes, I know that not everyone loves this movie but it's my favorite of the series. I love the repeat of Spock's death and funeral. I love the moments with Sarek and Kirk. I love the ending! I think it's the best ending of any Star Trek movie! William Shatner has some great lines in this movie. On the one hand, it might be nice if we discovered him with a son from a character we'd actually heard about in the past... but hey.
0345522303|2.0|I knew that I was plunging into the middle of a series with Lynn Flewelling's \\"Casket of Souls\\" (Spectra, $7.99, 476 pages), which is always risky, but I had read one of the previous five, and I like Flewelling's work (The Tamir Triad is highly recommended) so I took a chance.<br /><br />As it turned out, \\"Casket of Souls\\" was a bit of a disappointment. It was about 100 pages too long, and most of those extras involved the heroes trying to unravel a mystery that the readers already had the answer to. And in fantasy of this kind (pre-industrial world, magic, good vs. evil), it's pretty clear how things are going to turn out, so taking too long to get to an already obvious solution will leave many readers, myself included, just wishing the author would get on with it.<br /><br />It would be wise to start with \\"The White Road,\\" the first in this series, and most likely then some of the frustration with the pacing would be a little easier to bear -- though perhaps the effect would be exactly the opposite, and make \\"Casket of Souls\\" even more of a letdown.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|A beautiful story. The acting was fantastic and the music was beautiful.  A great movie I watched with my family (14 years old the youngest and 86 years old the oldest).  A must see!

B0002BO05S|2.0|I should preface this review by pointing out that I am a born-again Christian, and that I hold the story of the birth,life, death and resurrection of our Lord, Jesus Christ, near and dear to my heart. You won't hear me complaining about the content of this film. What I do criticize is the execution of this material. Sitting through this ponderous and dimly-lit narrative is akin to watching paint dry on a wall. I've only seen one George Stevens-directed film that I ever liked, so I can't comment on his body of work, but the way he approached this material seems to be that he tried to be so reverential, that the solemnity of the production just drags it down. Can a movie about the life of Christ be exciting and entertaining, and still be respectful to the story? Yes. Just check out Nicholas Ray's excellent KING OF KINGS, from 1961.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|I loved the content, but the presentation was a bit cheesy. That said, I watched it over and over and I purchased a copy for my son who has recently become a father and my husband who has fathered beautifully for 25 years.
B003S9GOWS|5.0|This set caused me some doubts as one reviewer has stated that the mastering of this set is exactly the same as the late 1990's mastering so if you have the previous copies, which I do, then it would appear to be a waste of money to buy this set.<br /><br />Regardless, and tempted by the 24 bit processing stated on the rear of the box, I decided to take a chance. I have compared every disc with the previous mastering, one by one and doing an A/B comparison, and there is absolutely no doubt that this set is superior. The tonal range is warmer and far more believable and the slight woodenness of piano timbre which was still apparent on the last mastering has now been removed. The somewhat dry acoustic remains which makes the recordings sound as if they were made in a small and well-upholstered room. This could well reflect Chopin's actual original playing circumstances in many cases of course so can be acceptable on that basis.<br /><br />Much may depend on the replay equipment of course and in that regard I have three ranges of equipment at different levels of fanaticism. All reveal the improvement with the best equipment showing the most improvement.<br /><br />As regards the performances, I have supplied full reviews elsewhere but can summarise these readings as follows:<br />Rubinstein's view of these works can generally be described as coolly dispassionate and he can be very tough in this regard. This is all to the good as in this way we get to hear what Chopin wrote without the distracting effects of superimposed emotional interpretations. A great deal of the writing is surprisingly discordant and it is impossible to avoid being aware that Chopin was, if not unhappy, at least he could be described as suffering from disquiet on a significant number of occasions and this shows in his music.<br /><br />Rubinstein makes this quite clear in his versions of the sonatas, the ballades, impromptus and scherzos for example. He is not the only one to take this view. Perahia can be uncompromising in these ways as can Ashkenazy, Pollini and Argerich for example. I choose these pianists simply because their views were strongly influential on discs as long as forty years ago and the softer, more emotional and salon approach to the music soon became unacceptable from then on. Perahia's version of the preludes came as quite a shock to me in its uncompromising emphasis of the discords when I first heard it in the 1970's and it changed my understanding of Chopin at that time. Other works such as the mazurkas and nocturnes are not so coloured.<br /><br />I would suggest that this set by Rubinstein is valuable as a corrective to excessive emotionalism in this music and thus provides a good starting point from which other versions can be investigated. This is not the only way to play this music - no one pianist or musician can ever claim to have the 'only' answer to interpretation. Nevertheless this is a set of such importance that it should not be ignored.<br /><br />At this price and in this new remastering, which I suspect is dated around 2010 when it was published in this boxed set, this represents amazing value. I personally find the disc of the preludes too old to be rewarding and the concertos are better played by other combinations of pianists, conductors and orchestras, but the rest are marvellously rewarding recordings from the stereo era.Ashkenazy, Pollini and Argerich for example.

When you in particular review a particular CD, I pay pretty close attention.

0316017930|4.0|The book presents some convincing evidence of why many people succeed in life.  It reads almost like a fiction book.  The author presents many profiles of people who have been successful and why that happened.  He looks beyond the obvious and finds reasons that go way back in time such as when they were born or where they were or how society functioned during their lifetime. It's a quick read and gives one reason to think about ones own life and the life of others and why they did or did not succeed at a great level in life.

B00821OX98|5.0|I don't watch television so I am not familiar with the current shows. I was laid up for awhile and needed to rest my brain from all the reading I have been doing. I did not know what to watch. I checked out falling skies by chance. I recognized one of the actors from a show in which he was the librarian. I enjoyed his work so I watched this show and I was hooked. There was so much action and suspense. I even cried a couple of times,  I couldn't believe it. I started completing a season a night. I love that I did not have to wait a week to see what happens next. In the last episode when the new alien stepped out of his ship,  my mouth fell open. I cannot wait to see what happens next.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games Trilogy\\" is one work of fiction that lives up to its press.  Suzanne Collins has created characters and a world that are both fascinating and disturbing.<br /><br />Elements of history and religious themes are skillfully woven throughout all three novels which make up the trilogy.  District 1, the Capitol, reflects the decadence and depravity of both the Roman Empire and the Egyptian Pharaohs.  The twelve separate districts are reminiscent of the Twelve Tribes of Israel.  Each has a specific occupational function within the nation; each remains separate from the others; some districts are deemed more desirable and prestigious than others.<br /><br />Characters throughout \\"The Hunger Games Trilogy\\" experience personal growth.  Emotions are real; reactions are genuine; and relationships, as they do in life, develop or wane.  Challenges occur and are dealt with differently by different individuals; some will rise to confront the situation and others will take shelter within themselves or in the world of addiction.  Violence impacts each character and every situation is one which may deteriorate into bloodshed and death.  Some will survive and thrive; some will not.  Those, who might be least expected to surprise you, may do so.<br /><br />All three books which make up \\"The Hunger Games Trilogy\\" are engaging and will maintain your interest throughout.  I do recommend reading the complete trilogy straight through.  If you choose to read the three components of this work separately, you may find yourself spending time wondering what will happen next and how issues and relationships are resolved.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' \\"The Hunger Games Trilogy\\" lives up to its press - it is a 5-star work of fiction. It is a series that is difficult to put down and impossible to forget.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had to reread Catching Fire anticipating the movie release.  I've really enjoyed this series.  I'll be looking for more work from Suzanne Collins.
B00BJKYM40|4.0|The Humans is mainly set in Cambridge, England. The setting is very believable and realistic.<br /><br />The book is written from the perspective of the person who took Andrew Martin's body (let's call him \\"the alien\\"). It is written in conversational style. As if \\"the alien\\" was talking to the reader, who, in his opinion, is one of his species. I think this is a very interesting and entertaining writing style, which is also very clever. This way, Mr. Haig takes the reader by the hand and leads them right into the story. He makes them part of it instantly.<br /><br />The main characters of The Humans are \\"the alien\\", Andrew Martin's wife Isobel and their son Gulliver. For me, they were all very easy to empathize with, especially \\"the alien\\" and Gulliver. I was able to follow \\"the alien's\\" problems, his discoveries, his moral changes and his feelings throughout the book. I also had no problems understanding Gulliver's teenage world and all the problems and feelings that he had. I could feel \\"the alien's\\" and Gulliver's relationship with all their highs and lows. I could also feel the relationship between Isobel and \\"the alien\\" but it wasn't depicted as intensely as the relationship between Gulliver and \\"the alien\\".<br /><br />As to the story, I really enjoyed it. It was a little predictable but still had its twists and turns. Still, I don't think that this is a book you read for suspense, it is a book that is full of fun and creativity. The only thing I would have left out is the \\"Advice for a Human\\" list at the end. I didn't really see a point in it and it was somehow boring. Other than that, I had great fun reading The Humans.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|E. L. James’ Fifty Shades trilogy is a wanker mash-up of Beauty and the Beast<br />and the Perils of Pauline. Of course it’s outrageous fiction. What do you<br />expect, starting from the premise of a 21 year-old virgin? But it’s a fun read:<br />dramatic, romantic and triple ecstatic. Do yourself a favor: buy the whole<br />trilogy.

B000002MUQ|5.0|Love the seriousness to this album.  Best guitar and amplifier tones Eddie has ever had on an album.  &#34;Strung Out&#34; should have been left off the album in my opinion, but whatever, Ed's an artist.  Sammy's lyrics are terrible, and the only reason I don't discount stars for that is that I rarely listen to lyrics anyway... To me, it's all about the melody that the singing provides, not specifically what is said.  Anyway, Baluchitherium, Aftershock, and Seventh Sign (very Rush-like) are worth the price of admission.  If lyrics had been put with Baluchitherium and he called it something else, it would have been a big hit.  Of course, I would rather it be the way it is.<br /><br />Thanks for the great music Eddie!  Keep writing and recording!

The idle rich (much like in Gatsby and Scott's other works) have nothing to do but drink and impress one another.  But no matter how I say it.

It is not just a social statement, it is entertainment !!!

Coming on the heels of the LA riots. racial tension  is unbearable. Also, Bosch has several conflicts within the LAPD.<br />One of the strengths of Connelly's novels is his understanding of police work as well as of human nature.This book is a &#34;page turner&#34; and moves rapidly to a reasonable conclusion.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Wanted the extended race scenes. Awesome. &#34;Now this is pod racing&#34; should have been a line used in each episode!
1400069289|3.0|Interesting information in this book.  Anybody can really change their life if they know their issues and set their mind on working to fix everything.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I bought this book on my daughter's recommendation.  I was expecting more humor, but not knowing specifics about the book, it was an okay read.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I use it for small pick up to whole rooms. My first one lasted 10 years. Hope this one will to.
B006WM2FFS|5.0|This is totally over-the-top martial arts. But very, very beautiful. I show this in a world history class after exams. It does show a good bit of Chinese culture, and is much more than &#34;just&#34; a martial arts movie. The scene in the chess pavilion with the zither player is worth the price of admission on its own.
0875845851|5.0|I got this for my spouse.  Please note that there is another book called The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book That Will Change the Way....  These are the EXACT SAME books.  word for word.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well done show. Have almost caught up. Cannot wait to see the rest of Season 3. Bring on season 4
B00328G4XY|5.0|I still own the vinyl and the sound is better.  Listening to the music brings back memories. I cannot wait to see the video
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I honestly love this game.....its a great teaching game for little ones &amp; a great tool for adults to teach
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I LOVE Castle.  It has mystery, romance, comedy, action and crime-solving.  The chemistry between Nation Fillion and Stana Katic is fantastic.  I can't believe I have to wait the whole summer for season 6.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game! Challenging but not so hard that it becomes overwhelming to the player. A little different than traditional Solitaire.
1571200851|5.0|It is amazing that you can make such beautiful &#34;flowers&#34; from a piece of fabric. I am so glad I bought this book.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I'm a Tom Cruise fan so....Great movie.  Good action and story is fun to follow. I'm Hoping for a sequel.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I like the game it like a puzzle and you need a strategy to complete that puzzle and it's fun and cute
B00005QCYD|5.0|I love dinosaurs and minus some graphic scenes I enjoyed it.  I only wish it didn't have so much violence.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Loved this book.  Started out a little slow but then I couldn't put it down.  It kept your interest the whole time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoying the book. Can't wait to read the secound  one. One of the best books I have read in awhile.
014241543X|4.0|This book was a purchase where the teens had to order for Summer reading. As far as I can remember my daughter enjoyed the book
B006JPS1OM|4.0|I love these games and this one is almost perfect! The only complaint I have is there are constantly ho scenes. I like them but it this game is a little much! But over all a good fun game!
B00006L83N|5.0|I consider this album a \\"must have\\" for anyone interested in prog metal.  It's filled with adventurous songs and amazing musicianship, and the title track \\"The Odyssey\\" is a masterpiece in and of itself.  It simply needs to be heard.
B002TZ3C8G|5.0|A well built thriller. Delivers everything we expect: tough hero, beautiful yet brainy women, tight plot and a satisfying chase and ending.
B009NY43NY|1.0|It pains me to only give this book one star but I have to give an honest review. I love this book series and this author. I was very sad to hear that this series was coming to an end but I was very excited to see how it all ended. Unfortunately I was not very happy with this book. I know that it can be very difficult for an author to end a book series because the author can not please everyone but I still think that Charlaine Harris could have done a better job. This book felt very rushed and it also felt like it wasn't put together very well. This book did not have the same spark in it that the rest of the books have all had. The characters in this book did not feel like the characters that I have come to know and love. The ending left me unsatisfied. I felt like she just ended the series without really putting any thought into it. I felt like she just ended it to end it. I have so many questions left unanswered. I have preordered After Dead. I hope that it can help me answer some of my questions. I am really disappointed in the way that everything ended and I feel so bad about giving this book and this author a bad review because I love this book series and this author but I just had to be honest. This book kinda broke my heart. :(
B00CBRADU2|4.0|Very entertaining. Lot of action good to see Arnold can still put out an intertaining action movie. Good story some what far fetched. As a Chevy guy really hurt to see ZR1 & ZL1 get trashed.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|i love love love this game.. its awsome fun. you ll like it too. give it a try. great way to trick your little ones into learning thier colors & numbers lol
B0049VZ222|5.0|It's a great show with great actors playing great characters. Every character seems like a real person with a real set of motivations. The suspense is amazingly tense and the scripts taughtly written.
B007TFG2Y2|5.0|I simply love this album. It is the perfect mix of pop, electronica, and indie.

B005RUUUAI|5.0|The Walking Dead season 2 is full of suspense, character development, unexpected plot twists, and like a good novel that keeps me turning the page, the show makes we want to order the next episode right away.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I have long been a fan of jane Austin. This book lived up to expectations as one of her finest. Good reading.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Fun and informative! Gives lots of an insiders look on the becoming and being of how Rush started and where they are now!! I love it, maybe more than my boyfriend did.
B00BHWG5C2|5.0|All 3 CDs are excellent, for your information, if you burn too much data in a cd you loose clarity. I have one cd released in Europe, that has the 3 in 1, and it is a rip off. But be thankfull we have this wonderful recording at its fullest sonic sound. For the $20.00 dollars is a deal.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|This game is basically amazing the graphics the first person is amazing But there are a lot of annoying glitch such as the quest waypoint and buckshot looking gun also the first person view of the characters right hand always start punching instead of swinging the weapon the bow is perfect doe
B007ZYJMU8|1.0|What a piece of crap. Kicked his dog to death and a little later some idiot urinates on a sleeping woman! How low has mankind sunk?
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Graphics are very well for kindle fire HD. Game is just all around a blast, best game I've played in a long time!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Item protects my Kindle, and is easy to carry around.  I especially like the ability to rotate as I prefer using the kindle in the vertical position.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the best 'hard science' fiction books I've read in a while.  Great read, good plotting, believable characters especially the main one.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game rocks. It's so real. Everybody should get this game. You can unlock new levels and their is a dodge that blows smoke. Epic
B000008LH5|5.0|Alvin Lee seems to be a much overlooked and underrated blues guitar player. Ten Years after sounds great and very inspired on these recordings.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I have loved courtroom dramas since L.A. Law back in the late 80s.  I only recently discovered The Good Wife (because that name threw me off and I only recently incidentally saw a synopsis of the show) and have been catching up on the first 3 seasons.  I enjoy the legal/courtroom storylines more than the back office goings on (of course, at times, they overlap), but I find the characters of Alicia Florrick and the 2 principals at Lockhart & Gardner very engaging, and I want to follow them on their next case.  I am aso intrigued by the backroom activities during Alica's husband's campaign for the governorship.  All in all, engaging storylines, and I think I'll continue to watch this show.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book really taught me a lot. I am anxious to start practicing. Recommend to everyone who is feeling down.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the movie so I wanted to read the book.  It was very entertaining.  It was different from the movie so worth reading after seeing the movie.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Saw this show on TV once and was intrigued, so I picked it up thru amazon.  One episode and I was hooked.  Making my way thru season 2 now.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is a great app for fractions. The interface and could not be any simpler. I am a custom woodworker and, while i can do most fractions in my head, this app  makes things easier on my brain. If this developer releases any advanced calculation apps with millimeter/inch functions i will be all over it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Always tells me what i want to know. I'm happy with the performance.<br />I'm not happy it makes me write a 20 word review, when all I wanted to say was I'm very happy with this product.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|First off one must understand that this is not a hard rock album. I would describe it as bluesy rock with a country theme. It's not &#34;Cinderella rock&#34; but does have some songs that come close to it, the closest being &#34;Solid Ground&#34;. Tom Keifer is a very talented musician and one of the most underrated musicians out there. Unfortunately the music industry today is a different animal altogether and most of the top &#34;music artists&#34; out there cannot even play an instrument, let alone compose their own music. Tom Keifer does it all and does it well.<br /><br />If you appreciated Cinderella albums, especially &#34;Heartbreak Station&#34;, then you will appreciate this solo album by Tom. It's an album that comes from his heart and speaks about life's ups and downs, of which Tom went through a lot. He is a man who speaks to the heart through his song writing.<br /><br />I've been a fan since the 1980's and always remained a fan, even during the Still Climbing era when MTV and mainstream radio abandoned them. I saw Cinderella in concert numerous times and they put on a great show. Tom is an outstanding musician and I hope one day to meet him and thank him for his music. It's been with me through the good and bad times of my life. As the title says, &#34;The Way Life Goes&#34;.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is a great showing of what goes on in an operators life, this is not a great story telling movie like for instance zero dark thirty which is heavy in story and is a great movie in and of itself, Act of Valor is a action flick, with story telling of / portrays operational and tactical abilities of what our SWOG ( Special Warfare Operations Group)  operators do, to me its a great movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game on me kindle<br />Played it for years in my computer but taking with me is a big.plus. I love to play
0743270754|5.0|This is a wonderful book although it is 750 pages they fly by, the author has obviously done a great deal of work putting this period piece together and writes so well you won't be able to put it down. I was skeptical of such a long book on American History (not one of my favorite subjects) but now can't wait to read more of her work. I would recommend reading the book before you see the movie. But you should do both.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|It's a good game, and I like the fact that once you buy the game you don't have to buy upgrades for it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Wow!!! Five freaking fantastic stars for this book!!! I can't begin to describe how great it is!! Im so happy I was given the opportunity to read this before it comes out. Drew is charming, wealthy and has the whole world at his feet. His a true golden boy. The irresistible charmer never struggles with the ladies- he's a love 'em and leave 'em kind of guy, well not so much love but you get the idea. Of course, his carefree existence is challenged once Kate saunters into his life. Kate is a no nonsense, beautiful and intelligent and resistant to Drew's charms. Drew knows the only way to get Kate out of his system is to bed her, but will once be enough? The story is told by dashing playboy Drew- whose thoughts give the story the perfect mix of crude humor, a man's perspective and insight and sincerity. He tells it like it is for a man and while it seems harsh at times it makes sense!! I could not stop laughing the guy is truly irresistible! His back and forth banter with Kate was priceless. Wow Drew and Kate sizzled!! I loved seeing Drew admit his feelings for Kate and once he realized she was it for him- he did everything in his power to prove his love to her. The other characters were awesome also- Alexandra, Mathew, Steven, Delores and of course Mackenzie- she stole the show. Once I started I couldn't put the book down- this is a definite must read!! Kudos to Emma Chase!!! Brilliant book Drew is going to give other book boyfriends a run for their money!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this book but it was my least favorite - katniss is in rehab a lot - ending felt a little abrupt but overall a good book
B009G78EE2|5.0|I'm too tired to write a full review but this album is incredible.<br /><br />Props to Macklemore and Ryan Lewis for grinding it out,
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Can't go wrong with Dexter!  I can't wait until the last season of the show which I believe is season 8.
B000JLSM00|5.0|i love this movie. it one of john waynees best. i'm glad it arrived quickly vor viewing. i;ve wanted to own it for a long time.
B00005N5S5|5.0|James Cameron came up with ideas for this film while he was sick on the set of Piranha 2(1982). The Terminator(1984) was a big critical and commercial hit in 1984. It was a good movie that came out of nowhere. The Terminator echoes Westworld(1973), Somewhere in Time(1980), The Outer Limits and 1970's slasher movies. Skynet sends The Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) from 2029 to 1984 to assassinate the mother of John Connor, the leader of the human resistance. John Connor sends his friend Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn) back to 1984 to protect his mother, Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton). The Terminator was well made with its limited $6 million budget. The animatronic T-800 designed by the late Stan Winston looks great. The music score by Brad Fiedel is good and sounds better in the sequel. The Terminator spawned rip offs including a Z grade remake directed by Ben Hernandez in 1991. This film turned \\"I'll be back\\" into a catchphrase. This film helped boost Schwarzenegger's career. I first saw this film on local TV in 1991. It was neat when the Terminator's flesh got cooked off and there was nothing left but a metal exoskeleton that chased Sarah and Kyle Reese into a factory! Arnold Schwarzenegger is superb as The Terminator. He's a cold, straight-faced killing machine. His Austrian accent has a robotic vibe. Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen are good as police officers. Bess Motta is good as Sarah's friend Ginger. Motta was a cast member on the short lived TV show The New Monkees(1986). The Terminator(1984) is a classic, action packed, science fiction-horror film.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I made a great house in a tree house and it has 2 Plato's and lounge. a house is so high, that I and to install ladders
B001HN694K|3.0|No paper work or booklet like I see with real DVDs, but the DVD works fine, can't complain at all.
034580404X|4.0|Interesting reading and fast reading--held my attention thru out the series--had some very explicit parts but seemed to certainly fit the theme of the series.
1587613379|2.0|The title of the book is intriguing.  Unfortunately the content is rather bland & lacks substantive research/recommendations.  Every chapter sounds about the same...
B002UWH8P6|5.0|I was entertained and jettisoned through galaxies, subspace and new worlds by the voyages of the Destiny, a ship lost in the universe. The crew and passengers of this series became real as their escape from danger in each episode made me shudder for their safety. The crew and passengers could also land on various planets along their travels, battle alien forms and enemies bent on their destruction, but they cannot return home. With creatively depiction of Destiny's fate in the balance, Dr. Nicholas Rush wants to save the ship and find out its true nature and why they were marooned. The true quest, however, for the captain of the ship, Colonel Everett Young, is to return the crew and its passengers back to planet earth. Highly entertaining.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Unlike the vast majority of the folks reviewing this product I'm not a gamer.  I bought this product to use while I am CADing.  I use Solidworks as my CAD program and I have always wanted a left handed keyboard to add to my station.  This product has been a great help.  Most CAD programs allow the user to program in shortcuts but you quickly find yourself having to hunt all over the keyboard to do what you want.  With this gamepad I can program all of the shortcuts conveniently for my left hand.<br />Overall I am very happy with it and feel that it is well worth the money.<br /><br />The only cons I see are as follows:<br />-  I have very large hands but I could see where someone with small hands might find it a bit difficult to reach all of the keys<br />-  The thumb joystick could be more ergonomicaly designed to fit the side of the thumb, which is how I think they intended it to be used<br />-  I glued a very small ball bearing to help identify the home keys since the three center keys are identically indented (this is more a failing of my sensitivity of my fingertips I guess)<br />-  A wireless version would have been nice<br /><br />There is still more I need to learn about the functions and there is, of course, a learning curve.  But, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to aid their CADing.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|A good story, excellent acting (I would watch Jennifer Lawrence in a car ad), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bradley Cooper was convincing as a man with mental illness and obviously researched the role thoroughly. I thought the &#34;I don't want my wife I want you&#34; was lightweight and predictable, but I don't have an alternate ending either. No fifth star may not be entirely fair, this is one of those movies that I heard so much about that it was almost impossible for it to meet my expectations, I wish I had happened upon it and could judge it for what it is, not what I expected it to be. Well worth a rental, if nothing more than to see JLaw dance.
0679805273|5.0|I am adding photos of my daughter's life to the pages of this book as a graduation gift. A personal story of the journey she is about to embark upon and a view of where she has been.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Both my husband and myself really enjoyed this. Great script! Funny, but with  purpose. Old fashioned boy meets girl, but totally updated and with a message.
0439023513|5.0|3rd book of an amazing series. Lots of surprising twists , absoutley loved it!! I would welcome more stories of Katniss in the future.
B0064MGU98|5.0|There is nice character development along with interesting court cases each episode. It does a nice job portraying complicated moral scenarios and does not let the main characters take the easy way out or avoid feeling the consequences of their own moral failures. As the season progresses, you feel drawn to each character for different reasons. It is as though you can sympathize and criticize each one simultaneously because each character represents people within one's own life as well.
B000QUEHNK|5.0|I read this with my book club, and we found many topics we could discuss from the obvious (the tractors) to Ukrainian history, family relationships, etc.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Before buying this album, I had only heard of Vampire Weekend when they performed on SNL.  Each track is very different from the next. Overall it is worth a listen if you are looking for something new and refreshing.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great story! It had me guessing to the end and I loved all the twists. I thought the characters were convincing and it leaves you thinking about them after you finish the book.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Provides an interesting (and to me somewhat alarming) insight into the mind set of special forces.  Hope someone has these guys on a short leash.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Excellent App, great value!  So many interesting fun and fact filled videos to watch and great music videos!  Love watching old TV shows.  Brings back so many memories of my youth.
B006M4F67A|4.0|don't really know what some of matching tiles are have to hit hint a lot but figure after playing awhile I'll figure it out I do like it lets you re shuffle when out of matches I really don't care how many points I get just clear the board
B0058Z4NR8|3.0|Although the book starts off well, it seems to run out of steam quite quickly and becomes repetitive and disjointed.<br />At times you can really tell that it's been written by two different authors, each with his own arguments.<br />I also felt that the authors brushed off any theories they didn't agree with through rather lazy oversimplification.<br />I couldn't help but feel the authors pushing there theory almost like a sales pitch.
0446614459|5.0|Baldacci has hit the mark one more time.  what powerful characters and twisted plots.  I never know 'who done it' till the end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm sure my review will not be unlike many others, this truly was an amazing story. I've actually already bought the other 2 books and I'm really trying not to read too fast just because I don't want it to end!! If you're on the edge about indulging yourself... don't be! Consider me a fan, Collins!
B000031XBQ|4.0|I am  a big fan of ABBA ..always have been as their music is timeless..never out of date...can enjoy it regardless if I heard it 25<br />years ago or yesterday. Purchased the spanish version as there is a couple songs I do not have in my current english collection.<br />This spanish collection is just as wonderful as the english collection. Some songs I enjoy more in spanish than english but all in all I consider this an excellent purchase.
B0012GMVSU|5.0|With this purchase, I knew EXACTLY what I was gonna get.....a physical copy of one of my favorite movie soundtracks ever!! Showed up in great time and great condition!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|THe best part of this is the continuation of the hunger games story.  It completes the series and it makes sense .
B000FS9FC6|1.0|i never got but i saw it on the tv that weekend it looked like it was going to be a great movie
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|Cool game to help pass the time. A definite thinkers game along with reaction time. I have to play on tablet to enjoy I would not suggest on phone.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|So glad to be able to go back to the beginning and see the some of the episodes I missed. On to Season 2!
B002M2T1UO|5.0|BEING DEPLOYED IN AFGHANISTAN CAN CAUSE YOU TO DO SOME PRETTY CRAZY THINGS, SO I DECIDED TO CATCH UP ON THE ENTIRE SERIES OF THE SHIELD.  WHEN I WAS AT HOME IN THE STATES, I WOULD CATCH LITTLE BITS AND PIECES OF IT, SO I DID NOT HAVE A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SHOW.  LET ME TELL YOU, THIS SERIES IS COMPLETELY WORTH THE MONEY FROM SEASON ONE TO SEVEN.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is going to be an instant classic movie along with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Peter Jackson rocks.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I'd played the original on the PS2, and this was part of the reason I got a PS Vita for cheap the moment I saw the deal. I love this game! If you enjoy playing Japanese style role playing games, I'd recommend this game without hesitation. If you're a completionist, beware! If you don't use a guide, it'll take multiple playthroughs to get everything - which might be just what you're waiting for!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I loved the book because it was done in Chris's own words what he was experiencing.  His story wasn't told to someone else and then them change what he said.  Gave me an inside look at what really goes on with these special men and women.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I had read Ender's Game years ago, but with the movie looming on the horizon I decided to pick up the E-book to read it again. Still a well written book, still enjoyable. Would recommend. 4 stars because I found myself disagreeing with some topics in the book this time around. Age gets us all, I guess.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I'm not a big McConaughey fan but was pleasantly surprised. Great acting, plot that sucked you in, and twists and turns to keep you hooked.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I only used it to download 6 songs and 1 album. Then I played two tracks and the data usage was over 500 MB. The other app Google(?) registered very little. I guess this app would be okay when used at home or at a public wifi but I'm usually on the road. I'm an avid fan of Amazon (4 kindle purchases, Amazon Prime and the bulk of my online purchases come via Amazon) but  of this app? Not so much.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is a romantic story that a guy can appreciate.  This is not your typical RomCom.  This film is funny, tragic, sad and romantic.  Very unique movie and concept.  Best Deniro role since the origianl Meet the Parents.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|The movie was excellent and I was able to watch part of it on one day and return on another day to finish the rest of it. The Amazon player worked without any hitches. Only issue was that the volume was a bit low. The visuals were excellent though.
B0030LYL88|5.0|The jewel case reads &#34;Symphonic Metal&#34; but I disagree.  It should read &#34;The Epitome of Symphonic Metal&#34; it was so awesome.  I felt that I was on a Dungeons and Dragons or Final Fantasy adventure as I listened to this album.  I suggest adding the main characters as pictures in the booklet, along with some random trading cards as an added bonus.  As for the musical style, loved it.  Five stars.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|great show, reasonable price. it would be greater if you could exchange  it when you are done watching it or lower the price for renting it.
B0006B2A42|5.0|t was a great movie when it came out. If you have never seen the movie you enjoy the suspense and acton that the stars bring to the screen.
B0036JU6CY|4.0|lots of ninja magic and lots and lots of blood and gore with a plot that ultimately doesn't matter; if you're watching this it's for the martial arts action and, like I said, the blood and gore.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|First of all this series is really fun and teaches good lessons to kids about friendship and resolving conflicts with people in a constructive way. It contains absolutely no R-rated material. The only place you might find that kind of material is in the fandom, but not in the series itself. I believe Amazon made a mistake when putting up a rating for this product.
B003QSJVV2|4.0|This is certainly one of the best movies that Nicolas Cage appears in and one of my favorite car movies. This one and 'Hackers' is also one of my favorites for Angelina Jolie. The presence of Robert Duval in his character is awesome too.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|This is the best album released by Vampire Weekend yet.  The band continues to evolve and grow as evidenced by their changing music style.  I look forward to continuing to follow this band and how their music continues to evolve in the future.
B00656C6KK|5.0|She has always been one of my favorites so to come out with a group of songs that were never released before was Great!  It was a collection from through the years and every one sound so Doris Day perfect.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This season was great. I didn't know how they were going to make it as great as the first one, but with all the spins and twists it was fantastic. I hope next season will be as good.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This no Hollywood formula script.  You already know about the kid and the tiger but get ready to experience amazement that you've never experienced before.  Pi's fear will be your fear - absolutely no lie.  But Richard Parker steals the film.  Watching Richard Parker play his role is nothing short of miraculous!  He was ROBBED of his Academy Award, and I have seen the film more than six times and I still can't find his credit.<br /><br />This film will bite you as you have never been bitten before.  It is a very rare and unusual story that is magically brought to life.  Get your treats, go to the bathroom, and shut off the phone before you start this film.<br /><br />You will not be able to look away.
0307387178|4.0|Came very quick, excellent condition. I had previously lost my book from class, so I bought this as a replacement. Nice book - it reads quick.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|This a wonderful story about horrible times in U.S. history.  We see the American Civil War from the point of view of Southerners who who fought for the South, but, more importantly, the point of view of those who were caught up in it through no fault of their own.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman were superb.  Natalie Portman turns in one of her strongest performances in a supporting role.<br /><br />Now, hold on the your hat as Rene Zellweger is the hurricane sure to blow it off.  Where she got all those explosively fun and weirdly zany characterizations we'll never know.  I'm willing to bet that she surprised herself the first time she saw the finished film.  But it's down there and she dug it up for this movie, and we are all more seasoned by her display of true acting talent, the kind of acting that you just can't see.<br /><br />It's a wonderful film.  The story is compelling.  The cast of characters, including Philip Seymour Hoffman playing a really hateful scoundrel, is superb.<br /><br />However, Rene Zellweger stands alone in making the price of admission a bargain.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This is a Good read.<br /><br />God bless Jaycee and her family for what they have endured.<br />Worth the time to read
1400069807|5.0|Michael Moss is a New York Times journalist, who spent three-and-a-half years working out how big food companies get away with churning out products that undermine the health of those who eat them. He interviewed hundreds of current and former food industry insiders - chemists, nutrition scientists, behavioral biologists, food technologists, marketing executives, package designers, chief executives and lobbyists.<br /><br />It is almost like reading a conspiracy theory novel about drug lords. The opening talks of a meeting of the heads of food companies, seeming much like the crime bosses meeting in the Godfather. This is a secretive industry composed of well-paid, smart, personable professionals, all totally focused on keeping us hooked on cleverly packaged junk foods. They even think of us as \\"junkies\\" or \\"heavy users\\" rather than consumers.<br /><br />Moss even describes junk food as a legalised type of narcotic. By deliberately manipulating three key ingredients - salt, sugar and fat - that act much like drugs, racing along the same pathways and neural circuitry to reach the brain's pleasure zones, the food and drink industry has created an elastic formula for a never-ending procession of lucrative products.<br /><br />As Moss explains, the exact formulations of addictive junk foods (and drinks) are not accidental but calculated and perfected by scientists \\"who know very well what they are doing\\". Their job is to establish the necessary \\"bliss point\\", the precise amount of sugar, fat or salt guaranteed to \\"send consumers over the moon\\".<br /><br />In a nutshell, Moss sees his book as \\"a wake-up call to the issues and tactics at play in the food industry\\". He tells us that it is naive to think that we can make them behave more responsibly because \\"Making money is the sole reason they exist\\".<br /><br />The book is fascinating to read and hard to put down.  The only drawback to the book is that it doesn't offer much in the way of solutions. Perhaps that was not his intent. Having said that, he is an excellent writer and whistle-blower.<br /><br />Bill Cashell - Author of \\"The Emotional Diet\\"
B007TKT2SK|2.0|I think there is a need for an app like this but unfortunately the way this works is kind of half-naked. At a minimum you should be able to jump back and forth from decimal to fraction. I thought this would be great for the members of my family who have a hard time with fractions but it's just the opposite.  It's not intuitive for them.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I had this game on my laptop and the kids and I love to play it. It's fun to try to use you mind and build thing to make it work.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I usually enjoy king 's short stories, but this one was a bit silly.<br />It wasn't a fully developed plot.
B0017M413M|2.0|[Short review, others go into more depth on the issues]<br />Horrible acting;  Very unrealistic;<br />Teams are sometimes extremely foolish & stupid besides, lacking even common sense.<br />We won't get into script & plot issues...<br />Lack of original characters was a big mistake, & the characters were *so* different, as to defy belief.<br />One of the worst Stargate movies, & far worse than the series.<br />Still, at least the ending was good.<br />Worth watching only if you're already a SG Fan.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|The simplicity of this app is actually it's strength.<br />It does exactly what it should in a very clear and intuitive manner.<br />The only thing missing for me is the fact that it doesn't let you do more complex calculations like 2+4x6, every time you click on an arithmetic sign it will calculate the 2 last numbers.<br />All in all I like it.
B00006RAKP|5.0|I am a die heart for music by Elton John.  I grew up with his music and still love it til today.  Who doesn't like him?  I saw him last year in Vegas and he was AMAZING!!!!  I would definitely recommend this.  I am very happy with my purchase.
B003HYSSZK|2.0|Matt Smith's acting is distracting from the content and adventures. He is a terrible looking doctor and seems to try to hard at acting.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Its cool that you can listen to music and watch the videos at the same time.Its like Pandora or spotify with video capability.
B007NU54H4|5.0|This was a Christmas present and the first TInkerbell movie I purchased for my four year old.  She not only loved it, but I enjoy it too.  I can not wait for the next movie to come out.
B002P73UQW|4.0|My wife and I really like this series.  just recently started watching and my wife wanted to start from the beginning
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I felt like my four year old was behind on Pre School skills, but with this game, she is catching up just fine ; )
B009DP9D6A|5.0|Found Noting bad about the packaging, Product came in good no tears, no damages, don't know how to review a dowload
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|It was more than I expected it to be. someone happened to see the movie and rated it as excellent! so did I!!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I fell in love w/this game via FaceBook some time ago.  I didn't  realize I could also enjoy it on my Kindle!  :)
0062082353|5.0|It is a great book.  I loved it.  I am so sorry to lose him in TX that way.  He was helping the poor boy!
B007F7XXKA|5.0|As someone who is a relative novice to international economics and investing I found the book to be very informative and enlightening. The book is written in such a way as to guide the reader to an understanding of each country's unique situation and at all times avoids a general \\"this explains everything\\" theory of economic development or market behavior. The book gradually introduces various rules of thumb and and economic jargon in such a way that you come to understand them by the end of the book.  The end result is a work that informs without overwhelming. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the global economy or investing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is a great ride!! I purchased it for my kindle because it had such a high rating, and this work truly deserves it. I hope like hell this author will be writing sequels!!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Way to go fireproof the room was a really good game I give it a four stars out of five game controls were easy to use on kindle loved the astronomical twist the puzzles were a challenge a and graphics aren't Xbox or ps3 but out standing none the less if the developer's read this fantastic game gang.  Most gamer like to get wrapped up in games like this and it fails to deliver on that end of the table,so it I falls short one star because of this. For anyone looking to get a challenging game and enjoy puzzling scratch the top of your head moment's spend two dollars and have fun!
B003KK6GJQ|5.0|A well written story, looks at the ethics of conceiving and using siblings as donors for sick children. This novel draws you in till the very end.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It's simple, easy, and addictive.  It's fun to load up when I have a few minutes to kill and keep my brain occupied.
B0095P31L6|4.0|It's cute and its Johnny Depp. Fun for adults and kids. Maybe more for adults. The chameleon is all about himself. The animation is good. Held my interest.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I had a friend that turned me on to these fans about a year ago and have been using them ever since.  The thing is tall, however - and BARELY fits inside a mid-tower case (depending on the case, most likely).  So keep that in mind.  But it does such an amazing job.<br /><br />On my own PC in a Full Tower, it dropped my Intel Temps from 50 degrees while idle to 33 degrees.  While gaming, it peaks at most around 58 degrees.  The stock cooler I was using prior would idle at 50 and peak at about 75 degrees.  That says it all to me - I'll be buying these with every rig I build - and the price is completely acceptable for the performance it provides.
1451668945|4.0|This is a good mystery, and the ending never occurred to me at all.  It is pretty typical of the author's style, although as noted by another reviewer, there are a lot of characters.  Fortunately though, I did not need to look back to see who characters were, as once I began the chapter it became obvious right away.  The ending is mild compared to some I've read, and the tension is somewhat lacking.  Nevertheless, the story is a good one.  I'd say better that some of the more recent publications actually.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Much better than the ASRock I replaced it with.  Plugged this in, fired it up and it worked first time.  Configuration is straight forward and easy.  Detected CPU and RAM at the correct frequencies, and was able to load Windows 8 without any glitches at all.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this board to anyone looking to build an AMD rig.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Grey's Anatomy - Season I will always be a favorite.  This series is where it all came together and got started.  There are a lot of intense and emotional scenes as there are the comedy and care free moments.  Grey's Anatomy gives you a real life feeling of how a large hospital is run and the life and death decisions that occur in a heartbeat...  Each intern reveals their own individual strengths and weaknesses in a crazier than life friendships and controversy that keeps them meshed together.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Where was I when this came out! I have always been a movie buff, but I had never heard of this movie. What a wonderful surprise! It is a truly remarkable story!! Peck at his best!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Considering solitaire has been around on various computer platforms for a few decades, I didn't think that it would be so difficult to have a usable product on Android.  As if the constant interruption of advertisements wasn't bad enough, the game plays very poorly and graphics are dismal.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The performances are grand, and worthy of an epic musical.  The transition of a large and unwieldy stage play musical is tremendous.  The direction is good.  In three hours there are very, very few parts that are slow or draggy, but there's music for everyone here.  A grand play is re-envisioned as a spectacular movie.  There really aren't enough superlatives for this is you like Broadway musicals.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I finished this book in less than a day. I really can't get enough of the hunger games trilogy. I wish it didn't have to end.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Channing Tatum is good looking, the premise and plot is small and not overwhelming, the direction is good.  This is not a ground-breaking or innovative film, it's just a very good film.  Worth a look.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This has great graphics and sounds.  There are a few glitches --- I'm beginning to think this is by design.  They &quot;just forgot&quot; to put in a way to exit the game.  Also, after reaching a certain level you can't visit other islands without accessing your social media account.  That said, this game is a fun way to teach older kids about financial responsibility; to have patience and saving money for the item they want to buy (without putting it on a credit card).
6305428042|5.0|I have watched this film, over and over, since the first time it came out on VHS.<br /><br />It keeps me laughing with the antics of the ladies.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic but even he could not hold my interest in this one.  Feel asleep both times and I feel bad for not being able to complete such a great movie...but there you have it the view from here
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I just love Gremlins and actually have &#34;Gizmo&#34; sitting on my desk right now.<br /><br />You never grow tired of Gremlins.  The antics in this film were so funny and I have to get one of the &#34;Goofy&#34; Gremlin dolls.  The one with the crazy eyes.<br /><br />They are just hilarious and enjoyable.  This film is just a fun classic.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Very funny!!!!  There was an edge of course but With Quinton T in charge you can have rap in the background of an historical period and with suspension of disbelief in full swing everything seems to work.
B00003CXDD|5.0|When I first saw Willow, I thought it was such a cute movie.<br /><br />The more I watch it, the more I see what went into making this film.<br /><br />It is one that I will watch over and over again, only to discover something new each time.<br /><br />Val Kilmer is great in this film.  He is funny and then at times, completely catching you off guard.  You'll love it.<br /><br />They don't have enough stars available here to give it my highest recommendation.<br /><br />A very good movie to have.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|Funny, fun, okay feel asleep.  My girlfriend really liked it though, so that made it worth it.  That's all for now.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I saw the comments on this film by the critics, saying that Cruise was going a different path with his films.<br /><br />I can say, that is NOT the case.<br /><br />This film was not only extremely well written, but the entire time, kept me guessing.  It is a fabulous film to watch and you have to watch it over and over again to catch note of all the details and clues.<br /><br />I don't know what the critics were going on about with Tom Cruise in this film, but I can tell you, ignore the critics and get this film.  You will love it if you love watching &#34;mind stimulating action&#34; to make you think.<br /><br />This is really a great film.  Tom Cruise, he is a perfectionist in his work and it really shows here.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I really love this show.  The leads are great. And Summer Glau gets to show off her talents more than previously.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Absolutely love this series!!!! Highly recommend this series!! I can't wait for book three to be released on June 4th!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I don't think I have the vocabulary to accurately describe my feelings for this movie.  I rarely give anything 5 stars and I rarely pay to see a movie in theaters more than once but I did both with The Dark Knight Rises.  I love this movie!  It' s the perfect conclusion to Nolan's Batman trilogy.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|This novel resists easy characterization and the statement that makes is one of joy and strength. Is it a love story, a romance? Perhaps a discourse on race? Maybe a natural hair booster? A coming of age story or an immigrant tale? Well, it is all of these and Adichie weaves it all into a wonderful novel. The story centers on Ifemelu, born and raised in Nigeria and eventually making her way to America on a student visa to attend University.<br /><br />In America she discovers she is Black, or more accurately what it means to be Black in America. The nuances of this being so interest her that she starts a blog that is well received and manages to make money from it. The blog is titled &#34;Raceteenth or Various Observations About American blacks by a Non-American Black.&#34; The blog entries are funny, insightful, dead-on, and often didactic. This inclusion of the blog is the most interesting piece of the novel. It allows us to see how America is viewed through the eyes of an African female and really African-Americans as well. I'm sure that most of this will resonate with not only African women, but all open minded women for sure. And what will certainly help in that regard is the underlying romance between Ifemelu and Obinze.<br /><br />They meet in school in Nigeria and become fast friends bonded by a sincere connection and eventually become lovers. Their relationship is great, easy and uncomplicated. When she leaves to study in America, with his urging and support, the unraveling begins. Because of her shaky economic position she is forced to find ways to make ends meet, with in at least one instance, horrible results. Her trials in America cause her to distance herself from Obinze who remains in Nigeria and never gives up trying to contact her.<br /><br />Ifemulu pushes Obinze to the back of her mind while dating in America. Meanwhile, Obinze after spending some time in England gets deported back to Nigeria, and becomes a rich man through real estate. The question is will Obinze and Ifemelu reunite upon her return home even after years of no communication? Hmmn.<br /><br />You'll have to read it and see. Adichie is a skilled passionate writer and this novel is a fine example of that, with few exceptions.on is will Obinze and Ifemelu reunite upon her return home even after years of no communication? Hmmn.<br /><br />You'll have to read it and see. Adichie is a skilled passionate writer and this novel is a fine example of that, with few exceptions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is just like minecraft except it has invisible walls and does not have caves under ground. BUT that does not take the fun out of the game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game.  Graphics are really good and it provides holdings.  However do not use them unless you get completely stuck as once you finish the game it is all over except to play over again. Can't wait for the next one.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I think he spent 80% of the content of the book explaining who he was and his beliefs and just a small amount of time on the actual near deah experience story which was what I was interested in. You can read both apendixes of the book and thats it, that's the full summary, no need to go through the whole book.
B0091WAN3C|5.0|this is one of the best movies i've seen in yrs!!! The action is awesome and the acting was wonderful!!
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|The band has grown up a bit but is still delivering their original brand of music. Lyrics are fantastic, grooves are addictive.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|If you enjoy Tarantino, you should own this movie.  If you don't like his style, likewise, it's probably not for you.
B00821OX98|3.0|The Story is worth 3 stars so far as one would expect with the first episodes. Generally, tv shows in my experience are at their best trying to acquire watchers than later when they are established and fall into a formulaic routine. (You know, when the situation is a crisis and is urgent, the actors seem to be oblivious to having to rush as one would in real life and instead take their time - I think it is called suspense EVERY time it is done, hence the formula..). Still I will continue to watch as give it benefit of the doubt as one should when a good story needs a little support from the audience.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|2012 will probably go down as the year of flops in Hollywood.  We had 5, count it 5, big name bombs, each of which had loads of special effects, a cast full of superstars, and months worth of preceding advertising on print, online, TV, and big screen.  In no particular order, they were Prometheus from 20th Century Fox, John Carter from Disney, Snow White and the Huntsman by Universal Pictures, Battleship also by Universal Pictures, and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter by a consortium of production companies.  Of these bombs, Prometheus was probably the one with the most hype as it built on the legacy of the Alien films by Sigourney Weaver.<br /><br />The movie was billed as part science fiction, part adventure, and lots of horror.  Unfortunately, it came across as more of s slapstick with gore than anything else.  Scene after scene broke all boundaries of logic, as if people were purposefully doing things to get killed.  The movie's premise is simple.  Sometime in the near future, human scientists discover a series of archaeological relics that point to a star system far away that sent visitors to Earth.  These scientists join a mission funded by a major corporation to travel to this star system.  Joining them is a crew of security, other scientists, and the CEO of said company, Peter Weyland and his daughter.  Upon reaching their destination, the crew of this voyage proceed to do everything possible to risk their lives and get each other killed in a variety of manners.  If you have ever seen the various incarnations of Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, or Halloween, then you have an idea for the stupidity of the acting and screenwriting.  This is unfortunate because the original Alien movies were smart and well written, with characters that generally made smart if sometimes shortsighted choices.  Not here; not in this film.  Whether it be the biologist of the crew getting killed by a snake-like creature, or the geologist getting lost in a structure he supposedly mapped, or the crew deciding to do an autopsy of an alien creature in open air instead of inside a quarantined environment; this film was a series of stupid scenes one after another.  The only saving graces of this film was the cinematography, the special effects, the majestic soundtrack, and the oral language of the alien race; glad they weren't speaking English.<br /><br />Overall, a very disappointing flick.  It fell below my expectations in every possible way.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|J.J. Abrams has done an excellent job portraying the new revolution of the Star Trek franchise! If you like Star Trek you are going to LOVE this movie! Now I can't wait for Into Darkness to be released!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game was fun and cute. For 99 cents it's a nice deal. Only lasts a couple hours to beat it but with imagination and creativity, it is a worth while 2nd play through.
B003NHRIUW|5.0|I love this movie and I would 100% recommend it to anyone who loves romance movies and Nicholas Sparks books and films.
B00005RDRO|5.0|to see actors that are nolonger with us, and how we were very lucky to have them with us when they were alive.  peter falk before his sickness,nancy walker , and so on.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not necessarily a science fiction fan but got this book just<br />To read something different.  This could convince me to read nothing but S F. Written by Howdy.  The story line was gripping, could not put book down.  Get this book.  I am going to check out his next book.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Honestly, this show has some of the most amazing acting I've seen in a television series. George R. R. Martin did a fantastic job of writing these books but for the series, the actors/actresses make the show.<br /><br />The extra features contained in this season set elaborate on the back-story of the characters, which adds more depth for an audience who may not have read the &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; book series. I know, not everyone likes to read. lolz. Enough talk though. 5 stars all the way.<br /><br />Also, it's beautiful in HD.
B001223BLU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy this album and have had it for quite awhile in CD form but wanted it on my Kindle.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This is such a good movie that I've seen many times over the years. It's that much better on blu-ray.
B0011Z32KI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy this album and have had it for quite awhile in CD form but wanted it for my Kindle
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I wasn't excited about seeing this movie, but my wife really wanted to. It turned out to be a pretty good flick.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I have to say I enjoyed this much better that the first book of the series. Kept me interested and yearning for more.
B0015519VS|5.0|J T's 20/20 was all that and then some. If you don't have go get it. You will not be disappointed.
B00BEOYPKW|4.0|Wilco's song \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" is a finely crafted song about that feeling of well-being when you're listening to a great band under a summer sky by the lake. That moment when you can lie back in the grass, observe the clouds, and let the music wash over you. You are safe and you have everything you need or want. In that moment, you realize you are sublimely happy. Wilco's song is about this magical moment, but it feels one step removed like it's only a memory that someone else recorded. Kurt Vile's Wakin On a Pretty Daze heard through good headphones, on the other hand, immediately transports you into this moment to experience it for yourself. You can dig the layered guitars or get lost in lyrics both wise and wisecrack. You can get lost in the labyrinth of circular loops or you can let the total effect entrance you. Whether you focus on the whole or its parts, this music will transport you to a wonderful place. Wilco's \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" is about a place frozen in time. This music transports you to timeless place.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I don't get anywhere with it yet.  May be my great granddaughter can teach me.  She is smart about games.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I was surprised to receive this item quickly.  I didn't have any problems with the CD even though the case was a little scratched but it was other wise in good condition.  Love the CD!
B004QL7K6Q|5.0|I wandered into my living room and this movie had just started so I watched and immediately started laughing. And pretty much didnt stop the entire time! What a great, underrated comedy!!! This should have had a Hangover sized box office. I seriously loved this movie. If you like to laugh, watch 30 seconds of any part of this movie and you will laugh.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|Awesome movie! One of my all time favorites. I watch it a few times a year just because it makes me laugh.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Well-written science fiction.  My only quibble with the novel is that towards the end, Card seems to be in a hurry to finish the story.
1558908382|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies! I love John Cusak movies and this is his best. Minnie Driver is perfect in her role as well. I watch this movie when I need an emotional pick me up or a really good laugh.
B003FOFJAY|5.0|I just wish I'd watched this show back when it originally was on TV.  Although now I get it 5 days a week on the DVR unless there's a glitch.  Thank God for Amazon.
B001AQO3XS|5.0|Another of my all time favorite movies. It's quite silly in many ways but that's a lot of it's charm. This Blu-ray directors cut is a great addition to my movie collection.
B00BDSRISA|5.0|This album is everything I'd hoped it would be.  One of those few albums you can listen to start to finish, over and over again.  Track 4's &#34;Trying to be Cool&#34; is a possibly my personal favorite, while the significant other plays track 9, &#34;Bourgeois&#34; on repeat.  Phoenix hasn't disappointed me since United and I'll remain a lifetime fan.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was written through the eyes of an innocent, intelligent 5 year old.  The subject matter is a bit easier to read through innocent eyes, I am not certain I would have been so intrigued had the main character been the mother.  There are points in the book where you are so involved in the plot that you forget to read all of the words, then you must go back and read those parts again.  I must say that I am impressed by the story writing, as the narrator is a five year old and things get revealed in an interesting way.

The children in this family had a very rough childhood but where able to leave the area but conditions as young adults sent them right back home. As children they could not see the love but as adults they had a better understanding.
