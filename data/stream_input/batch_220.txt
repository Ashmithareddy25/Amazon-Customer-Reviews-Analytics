B000002KD9|1.0|Now that I have your attention, I would like to explain why. Firstly I have owned the vinyl copy of this since it's release and the album is amazing and something everyone should own BUT these early Young releases are in need of remastering especialy if you own a decent sound system. Young has been sitting on his a** way too long to release remasters. Rumour has it he wants a certain sound and an artist has that right but in the meantime clean these up and release them for us living in a digital world. Perhaps if the catalogue slows down pressure will be brought to bear.
0783240503|4.0|JOSEPH is an entertaining musical that has a little bit of everything for the entire family. Donny Osmond stars in this video version of the popular musical and he plays Joseph better than just about anyone else. Richard Attenborough portrays Jacob and Joan Collins has a non-singing cameo as Potiphar's Wife.<br />The music in this play is quite enjoyable and covers a variety of genres from pop to country to calypso. My personal favorite tune is the moving \\"Close Every Door\\". The set in the video is rather simplistic, though extremely lavishly decorated and many of the costumes are, well, \\"interesting\\".<br />The show has a couple of great morals (lessons in love and forgiveness) and other than the sexual innduendo and risque costumes in the Potiphar's Wife scene, the video is great for family. However, after watching this video I realized that Andrew Lloyd Webber may never had intended for the story to ever be taken seriously. For example, instead of displaying any of Joseph's noble qualities, he is portrayed as a buffoon until the end of the show. Also I could never quite figure out why all those kids are in the production; they are always distracting and take focus away from the story. After I watched this tape, it occurred to me that was the entire point. These things are subtle and just by listening to the soundtrack or even watching most school and church productions of the show they are nearly unnoticeable. However, they are there. It doesn't take anything away from this delightful musical because God's truth cannot be hidden, but it is something to think about.

B00005ATQD|2.0|I'm not a fan of Kubrick.  At all.  Clockwork Orange was, to me, horrendous.<br />I watched Eyes Wide Shut with 5 guys, and 2 other girls.  Needless to say, the guys all loved it.  We girls did not.<br />Certainly; an exploration in fidelity.  An examination of commitment.  Too bad the movie caters only to the desires of the husband, and therefore, appeals to the males in the audience.<br />Naked Nicole Kidman.  A room filled with masked people; and only the women are naked. Naked hookers.  Naked, naked, naked.<br />This movie could have portrayed an equal balance of sexual exploration in men and women.  Rather than simply becoming yet another movie whose point becomes redundant to a percentage of the crowd watching, who is not interested in seeing naked women, naked girls, topless this, nude that.<br />My male friends were quick to defend this film, saying that we girls should not \\"overreact to such a brilliant film\\".  Please.  Had Kubrick created a film that was meant to appeal to both males and females, maybe I wouldn't have.  I'm tired of watching films that so disgustingly, so blatantly, are meant only to appeal to males, and being told I'm wrong.<br />Interesting idea... could've had mass appeal... too bad it's made for men.
B00005RGNY|3.0|shakira's music on this cd is not as powerful and emotional as her previous works. i found some of the songs on this cd to be a lacking of the voice i enjoy so much. her voice is one of a kind and i find that i loose my self in it in her music. but not so much in this cd.
0783117523|5.0|This film was the first I was with the actress Angelina Jolie.  I was blown away by her acting!  I think there are many things that contribute to this really good movie---the direction, the main actress, the supporting actors, particularly Elizabeth Mitchell.  The relationship between Gia and Mitchell's character was touching and heartbreaking.  This story follows Gia's rapid rise to supermodel stardom and follows her reckless behavior and finally her death of AIDS.  If you want to see the pre-Oscar Angelina Jolie, give this dvd a try.  You'll see exactly why she won the Oscar later.

B00005V1Y0|5.0|This mock documentary is a delight.  Centering around Scott, a champion ballroom dancer with a domineering, \\"stage\\" mom and Fran, an average looking girl with a desire to dance, the movie delivers great music, romantic dancing and a nice love story.  Paul Mercurio is handsome and charming as the lead character (I'd like to see him in more films but not like \\"An Exit to Eden\\", the horrible flop he made later).  This movie is about fun, music and dancing.  Well worth the money---I'm glad its finally on dvd!!!
B000002MNL|4.0|This album has quite a few songs that are catchy and pleasant to listen to. The big hit \\"The more you ignore me, the closer I get\\", shows how obsession and attachment can get the better of you, especially if don't handle rejection gracefully. The theme of love and the persecution that can be experienced is delved into in songs like \\"I'm hated for loving\\". Also themes of how dreams can die hard (\\"Used to be a Sweet Boy\\"), idealism about friendships (\\"Hold on to your friends\\") and fessing up to truths that do not necessarily flatter you as in the song, \\"Speedway\\". This work comes across as very cathartic for Morrissey, but setting that aside, the music is good to listen to. Given it's length, \\"Vauxhall and I\\" is short but sweet.
0780622553|3.0|The movie Dark City is a visual and imaginative feast, but, having it seen it twice now without commentary and twice with, I find that it leaves me a little cold. I really wanted to love this movie for all its visual spendor, but, amongst other things, a witless script, cold characters and a dour muddy appearance leave me less than moved. I get the sense that many folks have praised it for what it aspired to be rather than what it actually turned to out be.  The movie gives us a great setting- and setup- and then falls short on invention.<br />Like Blade Runner, Dark City is a movie is as much about its setting as its storyline. And what a setting it is! A unnamed noir-era, metropolis in which buildings bloom from the depths according to the mental machinations of the Strangers, a pasty faced, leather trenchcoat wearing bunch of Nosferatu types from below. <br />The Strangers are involved in a great experiment. They are manipulating human beings during nightly periods of induced sleep, putting them into various settings, injecting them with memories mixed like cocktails by the athsmatic Dr. Schreber (Keifer Sutherland), and watching the result. This is a potentially very interesting concept, and ripe for inventive exploration. And before the wheels of the plot take over, it succeeds- we are drawn by the potential of, say, exploring the core nature of humanity stripped of context. <br />Alas, the movie stops short of this. Director Proyas, like the Strangers, seems to want the characters to behave Just-So- that is, well within their assigned noir archetypes- and becomes ill at ease when they stray from their appointed behaviors. Thus, we are treated to what seem to be bland, one dimensional performances and very functional dialog.<br />As Roger Ebert points out in his fine commentary track on the DVD, the choice of acting style in the film was, perhaps, deliberately cold, deliberately blank, as the main plot point of the films is that the characters have all been injected with canned memories and have not had time to develop any of their own.  The fact that all the human characters are pre-programmed by the Strangers (who presumably did their resarch by watching old noir films) on how to act, how to behave and how to think, seems to me a convenient excuse for the cliched dialog and coming out of their mouths. This would have been fine had I sensed that, as the movie rushed forward toward its apocalyptic conclusion, the now free and independent characters were somehow, like Blade Runner's \\"replicants\\", budding strange new emotions of their own.   Unlike Ebert (whom I consider to be my favorite film critic), I did not find the characters to be warming up in any way.   And I felt no warmth or concern for them by the time the movie crashed headlong into its personality obliterating finale.<br />Here's something to help you understand what I mean when I state that this film is lacking invention. In his commentary, Ebert enthusiastically points up a scene in which we see the Strangers forcing a rags-to-riches transformation on a couple eating dinner. Their dinner table grows from the size of a card table to something that would be not out of place at San Simeon (recalling a similar transformation in Citizen Kane) and their home grows from a low rent apartment, to a palatial mansion replete with polished stone columns and candleabras. This is potentially interesting. In such a transformation, one could explore how humans change themselves to adapt to their station in life. But, since the both the behaviors and the settings of the characters are pre-programmed (and the dialog is cliched), the scene has no emotional or ironic impact. We feel no suprise or delight when the characters behave exactly as one would expect given their setting- lower class, they act hammy, upper class, they suddenly become east-coast WASPs. This is, of course, a requirement of the script. However, with a bit more \\"invention\\" the scene could have had a touch ofwarmth and humor.  Would it not have been far more interesting, and potentially illuminating, to have had the personalities of this couple left \\"lower-class\\" while their living conditions change? Perhaps, after a bit of adjustment, the characters would settle in to an upper class manner, but the initial cognitive dissonance would be source of much information about human nature.  <br />The Strangers, and Proyas, are not very clever experimenters.<br />A few words about Keiffer Sutherland, whose narration the film found a need to fall back on from time to time to explain to us what has been happening. I have no gripe with Mr. Sutherland in general, but his performance in this movie left me questioning his judgement as an actor- and Proya's as a director. All... his... dialog... is... deli..vered... in... a... monot... o... nous... gasping... cadence... that... grows... old... before... the end... of the first... reel. It sounds less like Athsma, with which I'm familiar, than a malfunction in Steven Hawking's voice synthesizer. I didn't believe for a minute that this was anything but an clumsy affectation. I would have loved to see Dr. Schreber pause just once to excuse himself to take a much needed puff on an Ventolin inhaler.<br />Despite my disagreement with Roger Ebert on the merits of the film as a whole, I find his commentary track to be among the best I've ever heard- no less than a treatise on how to watch a good movie. Unlike many commentary tracks, where a director or editor or screenwriter injects a comment every minute or so, often merely behind the scenes gossip, Ebert talks pretty much for the entire film. He postulates on the decision making processes of the director, and points up scenes that he thinks work well, and decisions that he likes (most of them he likes...) It is clear that he loves this movie and his enthusiasm is great fun to listen to. (Indeed, he turned down payment for his services to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest and more credibly promote this \\"overlooked gem.\\")<br />So, the bottom line is, as a movie, Dark City is disappointing- a \\"coulda' been\\". As a DVD, however, it's worth a look.
B000002LOM|3.0|Without a doubt, the song; \\"Sing your life\\" is best one on this album. The energy in this album is not terribly upbeat, except for \\"Sing your life\\", which I consider so good that I'm giving three stars here. The other songs did not inspire me much, but if you're a committed fan of Morrissey, adding \\"Kill Uncle\\" to your collection, would not be such a bad idea.
6303442846|5.0|I can't think of a big enough cynic who can dismiss the charms of this movie.  On my list, Paper Moon qualifies as one of the best comedies ever made, a mixture of childlike wonder and wry sarcasm, simultaneously detached in its narrative approach (thanks to  amazing understated camerawork) and intimate.<br />The script has no faults.  Scenes hurtle forward at a brisk but never hyper pace, every moment pregnant with character development and sharp dialogue.  Ryan and Tatum O'Neal's exchanges are pristine in their comic timing, side-splitting and touching at the same time, effortlessly exploiting the chemistry between father and daughter.  Their scenes in the car are so hilarious and endearing that you'd wish you could ride with them for hours longer.  And the film is rich in period flavour, from the stark black-and-white photography to the music to every character, evoking a sense of longing for a more innocent age without ever lapsing into downright nostalgia.  The themes -- the vagabond heart which can't stand still, growing up, identity, friendship -- ring as true today as they always did.<br />I saw this movie when I was quite young and it's never lost its magical hold on me.  Watch it again even if you have already; you will discover something new every time.
B00005QIPH|4.0|It's still is a shock (and a welcome one) to hear songs from &quot;Is This It&quot; starting to invade mainstream radio and the collective consciousness.  Yes, the album's gotten a lot of hype, welcome or otherwise.  But the roar of critical approval for &quot;Is This It&quot; created an expectation of some enormous rock revolution.  The truth is, &quot;Is This It,&quot; like &quot;Nevermind,&quot; is really a very simple and endearing rock and roll record.  Seems silly to herald The Strokes as the second coming, but rock is notoriously cyclical, and The Strokes may be at the starting point of a rising tide of popularity for more traditional rock and roll.<br />But all that means jack squat if the songs on &quot;Is This It&quot; aren't any good.  Fortunately, they are.  For people accustomed to more polished studio work, it may take an extra spin before the album hooks them, but it will eventually.  And it's easy to hear why.  The Strokes marry loosy-goosy, Exile on Main St. like production with melodies that are as comfortable as an old sweatshirt.  They feel oddly familiar (you could swear the riff from &quot;Soma&quot; was copped from somewhere else), but are welcome in all their old fashioned glory.  Add Julian Casablancas' casual arrogance to the mix and you've got a rock album worthy its fawning supporters.<br />Casablancas is a born frontman.  He sings with a cool detachment that still manages to express passion on behalf of his well-crafted (if blatantly youthful) lyrics.  A neat trick indeed.  The guitars drive the band's rhythm without being obnoxious, and on the one-two punch of &quot;Last Nite&quot; and &quot;Hard to Explain,&quot; you'd be hard pressed to find a better five minutes of rock music from 2001, or the past few years.<br />There's also an innocence to &quot;Is This It&quot; that makes it attractive.  The songs are so beat-driven as to be danceable, and none of the musical elements on the record shout out for your attention (compare that withthe WWF entrance music stylings of most Nu-metal artists today).  The music feels organic, as if you could have written it yourself.  That's a sound few bands are able to pull off, but here the Strokes have done it in a simple, economical fashion.  It's a refreshing listen, and maybe 2001's best.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Of all the westerns ive seen in my days id have to say this is the most moving ive ever seen. It bothers me that people dont just sit down and watch the movie, no they pick away at it and pull away the most interseting parts. <BR> Val Kilme( DOC holliday) is to be applaused in this movie because he shows the &quot;true meaning of friendship&quot;  hes there even when everyone else just lets him eat dirt.  Even though the movie is a bit exaggerated on some characters its good. its entertaining. thats what we want right? An entertaining movie that sends us a message about brotherly love and friendship. holliday is the kinda guy i think anyone would have wanted to meet, respectful yet commanding at the same time. i think the one line everyone will come to remember when they think about this movie, is &quot;Im your huckleberry&quot; by holiday and <BR>&quot;tell em im coming and hells coming with me&quot; wyatt earp. <BR>when i seen wyatt holding doc when he fell off the horse i felt like everybody should have a friend like him because hes not just docs' friend, hes his brother (in a spiritual kind of way).<BR> I hope this movie will come to be as moving to yoiu as it was for me.
1881273156|5.0|I brought this book because my boyfriend and I were going through some major troubles.  It wasn't that we didn't love each other; we just weren't communicating the love we had for one another.<br />I sat down and read this book and by the time I got to page 51, I had already cried and had realized that my view of love was one sided at best.  The funny thing is I would shower my boyfriend with flowers and gifts and sentimental trinkets and it never seemed to faze him.  I couldn't understand why until I read this book, and then I realized that I wasn't loving him, but instead trying to show him how to love me.  <br />Women and men are different and so it only stands to reason that their concept of love would be different.  And what I found out was not that he didn't love me...but that wasn't doing a good job at loving him.  Thinking back on all the pain we went through.  It makes me wonder how many relationships break up not because they don't love one another, but because they can't communicate that love effectively to their mate.  <br />How many times have we tried to get our needs and wants met and the only words that come out are how they haven't done this or they aren't doing that instead of just saying I really miss when you used to do this because it made me feel such &amp; such.  When frustrated we often speak out of anger instead of love.  This book teaches you how to effectively communicate the love you have for a person in a manner in which they can not only understand it, but also reap the rewards from being completely loved.<br />I recommend this book for anyone who believes that love is worth making sacrifices and to anyone who believes that love is worth the effort.  If you haven't figured out by now that things worth having are things worth working and fighting for then you will never have a prosperous relationship.<br />This book gives you the opportunity to take a bad situation and turn it into a situation in which your relationship can flourish andnurture not only the two of you as a couple but also you as an individual.
B00005B36H|5.0|By listening to this album I understood why did Tool delayed so much to released it. I am not going to describe the songs or the quality of the music of this album, i would just say that Tool is a band that first of all respect itself! If Moby is the genius of the 21st century and Madrugada the best new band, Tool is the band that will guide rock music out of the dead end of the last years.....Unfortunately there's only one TOOL!!!

B000063UR2|5.0|\\"Legend,\\" one of the rare gems from the brief 80's surge in fantasy movies, is all about the Devil.  Sure, director Ridley Scott does some decent world-creating.  The faeries are dangerous and appealing, as faeries should be.  Tom Cruise, as Jack the wild boy, delivers one of the most subdued performances of his career.  For some reason, Annabelle Lanyon's brief performance as Oona has always captivated me.  (I would have kissed her!)  The storyline of Unicorns and true love is simplistic enough not to interfere with the poetry of the images.<br />Ah, but the Devil.  Tim Curry's performance as Darkness is a spectacle to behold.  Somewhere in those giant horns and cloven hooves is Dr. Frankfurter.  Look for him in the lips and eyes, you'll see him.  Mia Sara is lovely as the pure hearted princess, but she is so much more beautiful when tainted by Darkness.  The subtle interplay and seduction of these two characters is what makes \\"Legend\\" rise above it's station.<br />Black as midnight, black as pitch, blacker than the foulest witch.
B0000062GE|5.0|This wicked, totally underrated album by Stabbing Westward should be way more popular than it is!! The brooding, melancholy vocals coupled with loud, guitar-heavy music makes for a totally engrossing experience. Any industrial or hard rock fan should have this in their collection. With all the pop and hip hop garbage that owns the music chart these days, it pains me when an album of such talent and power as \\"Darkest Days\\" fails to do well. Furthermore, now that Stabbing Westward has broken up we'll never see another fantastic industrial rock album like this again! If you agree with me at all, you owe it to yourself to pick up this album. It's inexpensive, and it's absolutely awesome!!
B00000099Y|4.0|There are some really great songs on this album(like Stintfist, Eulogy and H.) but I am getting kind of tired of people saying this one of the worlds best CDs. I might say that it was a masterpeice if it wasn't for some useless filler tracks (like Die Eier Von Satan, Message for Herry Manback, (-) Irons, and Useful Idiot). All of the other tracks on this LP are amazaing. With great Drumming and vocals. I think my favorite Tool album would have to be \\"Lateraus\\". Now that was a great, Soild CD, and if your new to Tool I would suggest that you buy \\"Lateraus\\" first. I have yet to buy \\"The Undertow\\". No matter what though. Tool will always have a artistic style all there own, that I don't think any other band is able to touch.
0552131067|5.0|My first experience with Terry Pratchett was with 'Equal rights', but 'Mort' is one step beyond! From the detail of Death talking in capitals, to the description of Mort himself, from the performing of the Duty (the collecting of peoples' souls), to Albert and Binky(yes, Death has a horse named Binky) and all the amazingly funny characters, places and descriptions and the hole logic of the thing. The dialogues are great and if you're new to Discworld this book WILL HOOK YOU!
B000031WD9|2.0|To me, American Pie is no There's Something About Mary. Both are gross-out comedies, both had summer releases, and both made a lot of money. To think they are otherwise similar would be like claiming Danny DeVito looks a lot like Brad Pitt, only shorter. <br />American Pie is a straight out teen sex comedy. Outside of showing a new use for Mom's apple pie, it covers the same ground most such movies cover. It is by no means the worst movie ever made on the subject. What makes a picture a hit with kids is anybody's guess, but maybe this one struck a nerve because, despite all our open talk and explicit images, sex remains a fact of life many Americans are uncomfortable with. The characters here certainly don't know what to make of it.<br />The story revolves around a group of high school senior boys who vow that each will lose his virginity on prom night, if not before. There follows much stereotypical male and female behavior. Most of the jokes are based on the old idea that, at that age, one's hormones make the decisions, not one's brain. There is some truth in the idea, and the results can be humorous. American Pie's creators simply don't break new ground. They do use some situations modern teen's relate to. At the urging of his cohorts, for example, one boy sets up a computer WebCam in his bedroom to record his proposed conquest. Unfortunately for him, he accidentally links it to the computers of every student in the school, much to his embarrassment. <br />There are some truly talented young actors in the film. Paul Metzler was the unlucky guy who opposed Reese Witherspoon in the wickedly funny Election. Tara Reid nearly stole the show as the dimwitted rich girl in Cruel Intentions. Here, their talents are largely wasted, and they are not much more than part of the scenery.<br />While I was watching American Pie, I started to get a creepy feeling about these kids. It seemed like they lacked something. I decided that what was missing was passion. The boys pursue the girls - and vice versa - in an almost clinical way. Even the couple who forms the bond most likely to last seems lackluster. When one girl decides its time to give up her virginity, it doesn't seem to come from the heart. It's more of a calculated decision. Everyone acts like this rite of passage is just another in a long list of assignments that life hands us. These characters make the whole process seem about as thrilling as a science project.
B00003CXI0|5.0|This movie was so great, outstanding, excellent, coolie and rox on ice.  I am telling u no movie gets better, you got to see it.  Special effects, great, new scenes, excdllent, actors, outstanding, and everything else was just as great.  I can't explain to you how great this movie actually was.  This is the best movie. I love this movie.
B00004SC3M|3.0|Entrapment is a good old-fashioned crime caper movie. The story of a master criminal playing cat and mouse with an investigator has been done a hundred times before, and sometimes better, as the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair. Still, this picture has enough humor, thrills and plot twists to keep most viewers pleasantly occupied for a couple of hours. It also has something most movies don't have -Sean Connery.<br />Mr., Connery, now nearing seventy years old, remains as elegant, wise and impish as ever. Perhaps this is because, unlike today's generation of male stars, he was never buffed, pumped up and made to look like a model in a media blitz for Nordic Track. Even as James Bond, he had a five o'clock shadow, body hair, and skin that was not deeply tanned all over. He has always been a star that we are comfortable and at home with.<br />As Robert MacDougal, art thief of thieves, Connery is, well, Connery. This role is hardly a stretch for him, but he plays it with his usual skill. MacDougal has gotten rich over the years and seems to pinch art treasures these days because he enjoys it. At the outset, we see him pull an especially spectacular heist, and soon, Virginia Baker, a beautiful insurance investigator, is on to him. She is played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose performance is not quite up to her usual standard. Virginia cleverly works her way into MacDougal's life and persuades him to help her with an even more incredible robbery. He doesn't trust anyone, but he is both amused and intrigued by Virginia. The plot gets more and more involved, and we spend a lot of time guessing who is fooling whom. <br />The movie's pacing is uneven, which causes it to bog down from time to time. In particular, the scenes in which MacDougal trains Virginia for the upcoming heist are too drawn out. These scenes are followed by some exciting stuff, but why the wait? This problem is especially prevalent in movies like Entrapment, because they start off in high gear. You can't then easily shift into low gear without losing the audience. Director Jon Amiel might have been wise to consider the style of three decades worth of James Bond movies. They don't just start with a bang, they are all one big two hour bang.<br />The violence quotient in Entrapment is low, which I am always glad to see. Perhaps more than sex, violence in movies should not be gratuitous. If it's essential to the plot, then fine. Otherwise, we all get the point with a minimum of bloodshed.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|...for this pile of over edited garbage, is not even worth my time.
B000022TSW|5.0|How on Earth can I explain to you why I liked South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut so much? There are several reasons. For one thing, it is an honest product. Not fettered by the confines they endure on the television series, the kids of South Park are free to utter unbleeped every naughty four-letter word they say but don't say on TV. And writer-director Trey Parker is free to unleash his singular brand of insanity on those who wish to see it.<br />Then there is the matter of not what you say, but how you say it. Or in this case, not what you draw, but how you draw it. The South Park world is drawn in such a childlike, primary colors way that it exists in its own space. In this way, Parker and his crew can get away with sketches and satires that should be truly offensive, except for the fact that you would have to have no sense of humor at all to take them seriously. These kids are and are not our children. Their parents are and are not us. It all has an Alice in Wonderland feel to it.<br />Finally, there is the art of the joke. When most of us tell an off-color joke, we end up sounding cruder than the joke itself. We are an embarrassment. Then there are the few among us who can tell such a joke in a way that makes the rest of us laugh despite all our efforts to remain reserved and above the fray. This is what I found happening to me in South Park. A small part of me was reminding myself that Mom and Dad raised me right. The rest of me was rolling on the floor laughing. Much the same thing happened in 1998 with There's Something About Mary, which is the only other movie I can begin to compare this one with.<br />So what is the movie about? Cartman and his buddies go to see a movie starring their favorite actors, who are Canadian. The actors gross out the rest of the audience members, who walk out. The South Park kids, however, enjoy every single minute and leave the theater talking just like their four-letter word heroes. Soon, they are in so much trouble that Cartman has a V-chip inserted in his brain. He gets an electric shock whenever he says a forbidden word. Things escalate, and America blames Canada for all the profanity our kids are using. War is declared. And, to top it off, South Park is also a good musical. The songs are well written, well performed and totally demented.<br />South Park is not for children. though they may be attracted to these cute little cartoon kids. It is not for many adults, who are repelled by these same characters. No, South Park is primarily for devotees of the TV series, who know what to expect going in.

6304806442|5.0|I only recently watched this movie after it has been out for so long. All I have to say is that it is chilling in every sense of the word. Any moron who watches this movie thinking that Heroin is a good idea will not think so afterwards. I myself have never used and never plan to do so, and this movie will teach many others why they should never attempt to either. This movie should be shown to students to teach them first hand the destruction they will face if they dare to try this drug. I rate this a must see for everyone who needs to learn the horror a drug like heroin can inflict on someone.
B00001U0DP|5.0|When I read several years ago that one of Italy's favorite comedic actors planned to make a comedy about the holocaust, I was appalled. That's what I get for believing everything I read. Life is Beautiful isn't a comedy. Director and star Roberto Benigni has taken what is, in fact, a grim subject, and, in typically Italian fashion, has infused it with a marvelous lust for life. He shows the remarkable abilities many people have to adopt to any situation and to get through it with dignity and humor. And, above all, he shows the remarkable lengths a parent will go to in order to protect a child - not just from physical harm, but from mental and spiritual harm as well.<br />This is a simple story full of the richest of characters. Guido [Benigni] is a young man who is always aware of the wonder of being alive. He can take the most mundane events and turn them into wondrous fantasies. He comes up with the most remarkable ideas for diffusing any bad situation. He is the hopeless romantic. <br />When he moves to a small town, he immediately meets the love of his life. She is Dora [Nicoletta Braschi], the school teacher daughter of a rich, snobbish woman. Guido woos her, and she is captivated by him. Her mother has arranged for her to marry an oafish town official, but Guido has a wealth of funny tricks up his sleeve that aid him in winning her. In the beginning, theirs is a storybook romance, but soon, they encounter an obstacle that even the resourceful Guido cannot overcome, though he tries mightily. Their love affair begins in 1939, when Fascist Italy is in an evil alliance with Nazi Germany. Guido is a Jew. Fate is about to play its hand. <br />By the time Guido and Dora's son, Giosue, is four years old, the Nazi have arrived to send Guido to a concentration camp. Guido and Giosue are arrested suddenly and placed on a train filled with other prisoners. When Dora, who is Catholic, learns of their plight, she rushes to the train station, and, in one of the most poignantscenes in movie history, she demands that the commandant put her aboard it.<br />How can Guido protect his child's mind from the horror that is to follow? That is the heart and soul of Life is Beautiful. Guido shows incredible ingenuity, and, for the most part, Giosue believes him. At times, he just pretends to, because Guido is so full of life, love and humor. His is an infectious personality. <br />The best label for Life is Beautiful is tragicomedy. You take the bitter with the sweet. You appreciate the gift of life. You do your best to see that, no matter what tragedy strikes, the young are preserved for a hopefully brighter future. All of these things are so hard to do, yet Guido makes them seem so simple.<br />Recently, Miramax Films went to great lengths to make a dubbed version of the movie. This is the version I reviewed. While I know subtitles are a nuisance, dubbing often robs a film of the inflections actors try so hard to put into their words. The new language can add an unintended flatness to the dialog. This problem is not so noticeable in Life is Beautiful, and it opens the movie up to the many people who otherwise might avoid it.<br />The movie won Oscars for Best Foreign Film, Best Actor [Benigni] and Best Dramatic Score.
B00005JKQX|5.0|With all the carrying on about the \\"artistic license\\" taken by this film you would think it had never been done before. News flash folks, Hollywood's been doing this for decades and decades. I wouldn't call \\"JFK\\" a completely accurate dipiction of the facts either, but I do call it a very well-made film worthy of the best picture nomination. Same here. Factual or not, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is an intriguing, artfully shot and entertaining film, and THAT's the goal here folks. All I can say to anyone griping about the \\"facts\\" of a movie is, I hope you don't find out the awful truth about professional wrestling.
B00005JCA9|4.0|Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant each appeared in two movies in the summer of 1998. Roberts starred in the smash hit, Runaway Bride, while Grant had top billing in the unsuccessful Mikey Blue Eyes. All this proves is that she can carry a picture, and he can't. Business and star politics aside, Notting Hill is easily the best summer movie they were in. <br />The plot is as preposterous as they come, but this is permitted in romantic comedy. Grant plays William Thacker, who runs a little travel bookstore on Portobello Road in London's Notting Hill district. Roberts is Anna Scott, the biggest female movie star on the planet. This is amusing in itself, since Roberts is exactly that in real life. On location in England, Scott wanders into William's shop one afternoon. He doesn't even recognize her until a customer does. Later, he runs into in the street, where he spills orange juice all over the both of them. Accepting an invitation to clean herself up, she goes to his flat. Emotions begin to smolder. What unfolds is by the book boy meets girl, boy loses girl, etc., but it's all done in witty, bright and sophisticated fashion.<br />Notting Hill utilizes two of the oldest Hollywood romantic devices - the two main characters have failed at love, and they come from social scenes that are polar opposites. Its writer and director are shrewd enough to know that these are tensions which can add the comedy to romance. She flounders in his world, and we laugh. He stumbles in hers, and we laugh still more. Even in the inevitable scene where their world collide, and the romance seems doomed, we find amusement. <br />This is the best and most successful British comedy [excluding their trademark period pieces] since Four Weddings and a Funeral, which also had but one major American character. We get a parade of those eccentric English characters we adore. By far the funniest is Spike [Rhys Ifans], who is William's ditzy, clueless flat mate. Most of his best scenes cannot be written downfor a family publication, but I can say that they are bawdy, as opposed to tawdry. Spike does not know how to dress, how to carry on a conversation longer than two sentences or how to react normally to life's simplest situations. He may be the one character who is most likely to also exist in the real world. Ifans is almost assured of receiving a Best Supporting Actor nomination next spring. <br />Roberts and Grant are in top form. She doesn't grin her way out of every emotional moment, and he keeps his trademark stutter in check. It's hard to say how much real chemistry there is between them, but it hardly matters, because they are two of the most charming and affable actors on the screen today. Their performance are right up their with what I consider to be their best - she in My Best Friend's Wedding, he in Sense and Sensibility.<br />The photography is excellent. One scene, in which William walks along Portobello Road as the seasons change, is remarkable. It's one of those complex-to-do creations that comes off as seamless and simple. Also of note is a moment where Spike, in his underwear, unwittingly opens the flat door and walks into a sea of screaming, photo-snapping journalists. It is a classic comedic moment.<br />I don't think it matters all that much that the plot is a tried and true one. After all, the point isn't whether or not you paint a landscape, but how well you paint it. If Notting Hill were a painting, it wouldn't be a masterpiece, but it would be very pleasing to the eye nonetheless.
B00005R87Q|1.0|Let me sum up the movie thusly:<br />1. We have a drinking game that my friends and I do. Every time you see a NOS sticker or someone says &quot;NOS&quot;, you drink. I doubt you'll make it halfway thru the movie.<BR>2. For cars doing 10 second 1/4 miles, a 1/4 mile race takes like 2 minutes. <BR>3. If you blow your engine up and destroy the rings and such, let it rest for a few minutes. It'll be good as new and be able to run from the police in about 5 minutes time. It just needed to catch it's breath. <br />4. If you are trying to carjack a semi, the driver will be considerate enough for you to fire a grappling hook thru his windshield then match your speed so you can come across the line and into the cab. He would never be so inconsiderate as to swerve or hit his brakes or something. That would just be rude.<BR>5. When building up a 2JZ engine in a Supra, it's a simple matter to overnight performance parts from Japan. Ummm...I can't overnight performance parts from Japan! And I LIVE in Japan!<br />I could go on and on but you kinda get the point. If you know nothing about tuning cars and are willing to totally suspend belief in reality for a few hours, by all means go see this movie. The soundtrack is quite good. If you do a lot of car tuning, however, be prepared to cringe and be prepared for everyone and their dog to ask you if you have NOS in your car.<BR>Oh and don't worry if the floorboard of your car falls off in the middle of one of those 2 minute quarter miles. That's a common occurance. We just pick em back up and move on. Now that I think about it, that must be how his car was able to run from the police after blowing the engine up. He must've been Flintstoning it.
B00000K31Q|2.0|10 Things I Hate About You claims to be based on Shakespeare's bawdy, politically incorrect play, The Taming of the Shrew. In truth, the movie uses only fragments of the Bard's tale about a man-hating young woman who is \\"tamed\\" by a man who is at least is mad as she is. It is a difficult work for modern audiences, because 400 years has seen drastic changes in the battle of the sexes. The film's creators failed to revise the material satisfactorily. There are elements of it which make it watchable, but it turns out to be a fairly typical romantic comedy aimed at teens.<br />Bianca Stratford [Larisa Oleynik] has never had a date. She's pretty and smart in a kind of valley girl way, but her Dad refuses to let her go out with a boy unless her older sister, Katrina [Julia Styles], starts dating. Katrina hates boys, and Bianca's social future looks dim. [This plot device is an example of the weakness of the story's update. In the Shakespeare version, the younger sister could not marry until her shrewish sister did. This was a custom of the time. Bianca's father comes off as a fruitcake.] Enter Cameron [Joseph Gordon-Levitt], the new boy at Padua High in Seattle. It's love at first sight when he meets Bianca. One of his friends convinces the campus hunk, who also has the hots for Bianca, to pay the school rebel, Patrick [Heath Ledger] to con Katrina into going out with him. This will free Bianca. Naturally, the idea falls apart, and the characters encounter a series of comic mishaps. <br />There are some bright spots. The story lights up when Julia Styles and Heath Ledger are onscreen. Unlike the other performers, most of whom came from television, these two have worked in live theater since they were kids. He was trained in Australia, she in New York. They are obviously familiar with the original play. In addition, they have an obvious chemistry. <br />The school's guidance counselor, who spends most of her time writing a bad erotic novel, is hilarious. A black English teacher with attitude reads Shakespeare's sonnets with a rap rhythm. They actual sound pretty good. His bad attitude may be caused by the school's being about 98% white. <br />Seattle and Tacoma, the two cities the movie was shot in, provide lush backdrops. The songs chosen for the movie are weak for the most part. It is hard to imagine this hip high school crowd being eager to jump and dance to these tunes. Out takes are shown during the end credits. These are interesting because they imply that 10 Things I Hate About You should have been far more energetic and offbeat.
0452282152|4.0|I can only imagine how inspired Tracy Chevalier was to create an entire story around Vermeer's painting.  Her characterizations were amazing considering how short the book is.  <br />Griet was so young yet her life made her grow up fast and learn how to make things work to her advantage....at least to the best advantage she could as a poor maid.  <br />I enjoyed Griet, respected her and felt sorry for her.  <br />I wish the book had been longer to delve deeper into all the issues that were brought to light.  But since this book is based on a painting that is all the story that was needed.
0767836286|3.0|I love a great thriller. While Arlington Road is not a great one, it's a decent one. It suffers from a modern-day Hollywood plague I have dubbed The Plot Virus. This malady can occur in several ways. The people who brought the script are not bright enough to see how lacking it is. Or, the script is great, but people with egos bigger than Texas can't resists tampering with it. Or, at least one powerful executive's kid didn't like it at a preview, so it gets re-editied. Whatever the cause, the results are the usually the same. The big surprise ending isn't logical, leaving one feeling deflated and a bit cheated. <br />Arlington Road starts off like a racehorse out of the gate. We see a dazed young boy stumbling down the middle of a suburban road. Michael Faraday [Jeff Bridges] drives up and gets out to help. Seeing that the lad is badly injured, he rushes him to the hospital. A little later, in the emergency room, he meets the boy's grateful parents, Oliver and Cheryl Lang [Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack]. Turns out they are new neighbors of Faraday's. Soon, a friendship blossoms. <br />Faraday is already a basket case. He teaches a course in terrorism at a local university. Wouldn't you know it? His wife was killed three years earlier in a botch FBI raid on a suspected terrorist group. His young son is withdrawn, but comes back to life when he starts hanging out with the Lang's now recovered kid. As for Oliver and Cheryl, there is something not quite right about them. When Faraday gets suspicious and starts investigating, he finds himself being dragged into some very dark business. <br />The movie's stars - Bridges, Robbins and Cusack - are among our best actors. Bridges is typically masculine yet vulnerable here, while Robbins is his usual otherworldly self. It is Cusack who shines the brightest. Her Cheryl is a woman who says kind, warm things with just the slightest lack of sincerity on her void. She's one of those people with a helpful facade who can wreak havoc ineveryone's lives. <br />Another plus is the musical score by Angelo Badalamenti and Tomandandy [Tom Hadiu and Andy Milburn]. For once, we are not bombarded by songs meant to fill a CD. The music here is pure thriller - loud, jagged and often cacophonous. It greatly enhances the mood of the film. <br />Sadly, for all the good elements in Arlington Road, we are left with that plot. In the best of thrillers, such as this year's smash hit The Sixth Sense, even if the story may is implausible, the seemingly odd and off-kilter events that occur all make sense in a logical and surprising conclusion. You look back and think, Oh, that's why this and that happened. They fooled me until the end, and I got my money's worth. An inferior script, like Arlington Road's, may have a riveting, edge-of your-seat climax, but it only serves to make what leads up to it totally improbable.You think, Yeah, right!
0807282375|5.0|Absolute shock settled into me shortly after I finished Philip Pullman's latest addition to the His Dark Materials trilogy. The immense tragedy of the ending threatened to be overwhelming. I won't reveal what happens at the end of this masterpiece. Suffice to say that even now, three days later, ten minutes does not go by without me thinking about this fantastic book. I have told all of my friends and family to get their hands on a copy of this book as soon as possible. It left me absolutely breathless. Many people assume that, since it is fantasy, it isn't worth reading. I myself am not ordinarily a fantasy fan, but this trilogy has held me transfixed at the edge of my seat. Which begs the question: What am I to do now? I am in the habit of always having a book on the go, but since I finished The Amber Spyglass, I haven't started anything new, nor do I want to. Nothing can measure up. I am walking around in a perennial daze, filled with a new sense of tragedy.<BR>Buy this book! It's one of those rare books that make you laugh, cry, and think all at once.
B00000K31V|4.0|The gifted Canadian director David Cronenberg first got attention in America with a little film called Videodrome. Later, he helmed the commercially successful remake of The Fly, one of my favorite sci-fi movies of the 1980s. With few exceptions, he has stayed in the fantasy and sci-fi genres. eXistenZ is his best effort in over ten years, but is the kind of movie which divides audiences into those who think its a cult classic and those who think its just bizarre.<br />Cronenberg has a fascination with technology and how it might alter civilization in ways much more ominous than the average person would ever dream of. In eXistenZ he looks at how game technology might advance to the stage where is alters our perception of reality. His vision may seem silly to many viewers, but, considering that some current popular video games are said to be much like those our armed forces use to dehumanize recruits, he may be more on target than we'd like to think.<br />It is hard to say much about the picture's plot without giving too much away. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Allegra Geller, a brilliant games programmer. She is a star to game world aficionados. A group, perhaps terrorists or perhaps people from a rival corporation, are out to get Allegra. Ted Pikul [Jude Law] is assigned to protect her, and the two go off in search of a safe place. Along the way, she talks him into playing her latest virtual reality game, which is eXistenZ. I'll end the plot information by saying that this is one killer game.<br />Cronenberg has created a movie that works only if you go with it. If you resist what you see, it doesn't work. The scenes where Allegra and Ted are in the virtual reality game are naturally dreamlike, but even the scenes in real life have a disturbing, nightmare quality to them. Rest assured that everything makes sense in the end.<br />Jennifer Jason Leigh is near perfect, as always. She has always chosen roles that appeal to her, rather than ones which might make her a movie star. As a result, she is easily among the top ten actresses of her generation. Her Allegra is intense, alert, brilliant, driven, and more than a little crazy. Jason Leigh is one of those rare performers who has acting down to a glance, a hand motion or a slight shift in eye focus. Jude Law himself continues on the road to becoming a memorable character actor. His Ted is at once sensuous yet reserved, cocky yet paranoid, steely yet vulnerable. I can't imagine anyone else in the role. <br />eXistenZ certainly does not have the digital FX power of The Matrix, a film it vaguely resembles. It is not played for laughs like The Mummy. It is a carefully thought out movie. Cronenberg has delivered one of the scarier and more innovative pictures of the year.

B00002E233|3.0|...The result is Deep Blue Sea. Surprisingly, the result is a dandy horror film. It is no classic, but it has chills and thrills to spare. At least this was my experience, and I am all that afraid of sharks.<br />The story is much different, but the villain is the same. Actually, we have four to-die-for sharks here. Samuel L. Jackson plays a billionaire whose company is underwriting scientific research in which some chemicals in shark brains are being used to find a cure for Alzheimer's. When Dr. Susan McAlister [Saffron Burrows] is told that the project is to be canceled due to poor results, she begs her benefactor to give her just two or three more days. Off they fly to the research site, which is a sort of huge floating fish tank off the coast of California. It is the weekend, and only a skeleton staff is on hand. They are the typical band of nutty geniuses found in such movies.<br />The first twenty minutes or so seem to be intentionally set up to make this seem like an ordinary thriller. I think director Rennie Harlan wanted to lull the audience into thinking there would be few surprises. Things change fast when an ugly secret comes out. In order to move the project along, the head of the project has genetically modified the sharks' brains. Now they are super intelligent. This little scientific nudge soon proves to be a complete disaster. These creatures naturally want out of their prison, and they've got a plan.<br />Deep Blue Sea works for several reasons. The plot is absurd, but it is not so idiotic that you roll your eyes over it. The actors are uniformly good, much like the casts of my all time favorite horror movies, Alien and Aliens. Model-turned-actress Saffron Burrows is convincing as Dr. McAlister, whose pride makes it hard for her to admit that her work has been a big mistake. Thomas Jane has a great time playing Carter Blake, an ex-con who turns out to be an unlikely hero. LL Cool J, always fun to watch, is Preacher, the film's comic relief.<br />Deep Blue Sea remembers that one of the basic elements of a horror story is isolation. The characters find themselves marooned on a dreadful oceanic vessel in the middle of a tropical storm, while the sharks tear away at the structure, causing it to start sinking. Meanwhile, jolting music by Trevor Rabin plays at full blast.<br />Most of the sharks are either animatronic or computer generated, but they look frightfully real. With the exception of [a previous movie] years ago, most movies that take place mostly underwater have not worked. Deep Blue Sea is an exception. Whether it's to save themselves or to try to kill the sharks, the crew must go in the water a lot. In the murky sea or around any water-filled part of the vessel, a forty-foot long - and very upset - eating machine is apt to appear. <br />If Jaws kept you away from the beach for twenty years, do not even think about seeing this movie. If not, you will enjoy this fast, creepy and almost intelligent shark feast.
B000022TT4|5.0|This is an excellent collection of performances from U2's pre-Achtung Baby days. Most of the good songs from that time frame are on here (still missing New Year's Day, which also is not on Elevation Tour dvd - what's up with that?!). The Edge's 'opening song' of Van Demien's Land is a nice, slow, mellow piece, which picks up with Desire on Track3. This song never sounded better now that we can hear it in DD 5.1. Track4 - Exit/Gloria has to be one of my all-time favorites at the moment. This rendition of Exit puts their previous album version of it to shame. They way they worked in Gloria with the song sounds really nice.<br />Bono's emotions really come through in Sunday Bloody Sunday. Where the Streets Have No Name has an amazing buildup, and With or Without You is touching as always.<br />Basically this 'movie' is a collection of some really, really good performances. It truly is first-rate.
0767821629|4.0|Hollywood has made a fortune recently on movies like The Matrix, The Mummy, The Haunting, The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense. Each of these movies has, in its own way, questioned reality -- what is there and what isn't, what we think is there but isn't, and what isn't there, though we think it is. The Thirteenth Floor is similar, but it bombed at the boxoffice, no doubt because the distributor opened it too close to The Matrix, an admittedly superior movie. Still, this is a stylish little thriller, whose sole purpose is to entertain. Many critics were quick to point out that the story is utter nonsense, but I find that even many great movies fail the logic test.<br />The time is the present. A genius computer programmer named Hannon Fuller [Armin Mueller-Stahl] has a company in Los Angeles that is developing an advanced virtual reality project. It's a sort of a game that takes place in the city in 1937. It's realism is so great that the participants believe they are actually in that time period when they are in the game. Then Fuller is brutally murdered. His right-hand man, Douglas Hall [Craig Bierko] is left in charge, but soon discovers that Fuller has been playing some complex games of his own, including leaving the clues to his killer's identity back in the computer's 1937 Los Angeles. Considered a suspect himself, Douglas must go into the game to unravel an ever evolving mystery. Our first assumption is that Fuller unleashed a monster when he created the program, but we then learn that this is only part of the answer.<br />While The Thirteenth Floor is more of a thriller than it is a high tech special effects dazzler, there are some excellent recreations of old Los Angeles. The buildings may be somewhat more Art Deco than they really were, but they are pretty to look at. Computer generated trolleys cruise along the streets. The costumes, the sounds and the slang of that time are believable. In fact, the 1937 scenes often seem more authentic than the 1999 ones, but, considering the climax, that may have been done on purpose.<br />One way to dramatically lower a film's cost is to cast it with actors who aren't several million dollars a pop. The Thirteenth Floor certainly went this route, though, without a single familiar star, this may have also impacted its income. This shouldn't matter to the viewer, because the cast is quite good. Craig Bierko does as a splendid job as Douglas and his two alter-egos. Gretchen Moll is believable as the beautiful Jane Fuller, who may or may not be Hannon's daughter. Despite its dismal financial performance, this is the kind of movie in which actors get noticed, and I expect to see a lot more of Bierko and Moll. The other major characters are played by performers you've seen a dozen times, but whose names you have never known.<br />The Thirteenth Floor will not please everyone. It is, for example, a little too serious for its own good. The plot has a lot of twists and turns. The story is preposterous. Yet I admittedly have a fondness for thrillers like this, because they keep you alert without really requiring you to think much. They are also good for transporting you to a fantasy world where no one behaves like your friends and neighbors.

B00005YW4H|5.0|The sounds from this CD are magical.  Norah Jones' vocals are a mix between SADE, Bonnie Raitt, and pure silk.  It was nice to hear real music from a new artist.  In a time of pop songs with little musical value, Norah truly brings it home.  Hearing the complex vocals, jazz, blues, and a little country are just enchanting.  The first time I played this CD I melted into my chair and forgot the rest of the world.  The back ups for vocals are just one part of a CD that makes all other new female artists pale in comparison.  I true delight.
B00005JKJA|5.0|One super excellent film, a classic. <br />It is of interest that this movie was intended for TV and rejected eventually. That is, the first two hours of the movie constitute the TV pilot, and Lynch added the last half hour to close things up. Otherwise as a series, I expect it would have been a Twin Peakean odyssey with the interminable but interesting<BR>Lynchian meanderings.<br />I must ashamedly admit that it did not gel for me until the second viewing when (slapping forehead) all became clear. The third time, it was just a relaxing evening basking in the intricate details that Lynch is famous for. The music, for my money, is top rate.<br />You will love/hate this movie [choose one]. No middle ground. Be sure to give it a chance to work on you.<br />I look forward to watching this movie at least once a year for the rest of my days.

B00005QK5X|5.0|Disclaimer: I'm fully aware of the excessive generosity with which reviewers hand out stars on Amazon.  That said, this three cd set deserves every single one of the stars my stingy self is handing out.  Not being familiar with the Wipers would be on par with having no idea about Joy Division, the Velvet Underground, or Yo La Tengo (just to name a few).  <br />Incidentally, could someone tell me where on earth Nirvana's cover of \\"D-7\\" is hiding out?
0060506989|5.0|This book is a paradox of emotions as you are drawn into the battle of lz x-ray. you are on the front lines with the men and boys as they found a new level of courage with every hour they were there.  X-ray shows what can happen when well trained men are led by great officers.  lz-albany shows everything that can go wrong in combat. ultimately there were alot of lives lost over stupid decisions and indecisive action.  both battles will keep you glued to your seat.  The &quot;where they are now&quot; portion of the book, will leave you feeling like you know these men. overall a truly awesome book.
B000002GXS|4.0|Great backup! Tom, of course careens through every tune skillfully.  One might even think this guy is for real, but alas, it's an act.  He's \\"in character\\" (i.e.acting out the part of leering wino/poet) and he's REALLY believable, but it's an illusion.  A talented illusionist.  Did somebody call me liar?  I remember when Tom was a folksinger...seriously, I even saw him a few times in and around L.A., he switched routines and this one brought in the coin, so he stuck with it.<br />His backup band is pure gold...and Tom's dusky, whiskey and tobacco vocals would cut through any mud.  These were great LP's (remember those) to drink beer to on those long cold Alaskan nights...long ago.
0375420525|4.0|I couldn't put this book down, even though I was terrified while reading it. I became afraid of my apartment, of being in rooms alone, of the closet door being left open. Read this book and you'll know why.
B000062Y98|5.0|I've been waiting for this one a while.<br />As some have mentioned before me, it can take a couple of listens for Blind Guardian to really *click* with the listener.  I've had this for a few days now--all day on repeat, yesterday--and I think I'm ready to offer an opinion, if not a final verdict.<br />The thing I like most about the previous Blind Guardian albums I own is the sheer emotional impact of their music, vocally and instrumentally.  That is all here.  \\"And Then There Was Silence\\" clocks in at over 14 intense minutes, and is worthy of a CD all its own (which is probably why I bought the single).<br />There aren't any throw-aways on this album, and if the lyrics suffer somewhat by comparison with NiME, that owes more to the strength of that previous effort than the weakness of this one.<br />The CD I bought includes a spanish-language version of the ballad (not exactly a ballad, but I lack a better term) \\"Harvest of Sorrow,\\" which is beautiful, if completely incomprehensible to me.  [The \\"Silence\\" single includes the english version of this song and a .MOV video for \\"Born in a Mourning Hall.\\"]<br />If you had doubts about the direction the band was moving in after hearing Nightfall, this album may disappoint.  For myself,  I consider Nightfall to be one of my top 3 favorite albums of all time (in ANY genre), and I was delighted by this album as well...<br />The only down note for me was one I've had with all of their previous albums that I own--I'm never quite happy with the mix.  I prefer slightly punchier high and lows, with the low-middle range de-emphasized a bit.  Even with this minor complaint, this album is closer to 5 than 4, and I usually tweak the mix a little when burning my listening-at-work CDs anyway.
1573301051|4.0|Second diva's collection....<BR>different artists from diva's 1<BR> Aretha Franklin shows her talent, Gloria Estefan knows how to entertain an audience, Maria Carey and Shania Twain sound brilliant... add Carole King and you have a perfect blend for all musical tastes.... well worth adding this dvd!!!
B00005JKQX|5.0|This brilliantly-crafted movie deserves every Oscar it was nominated for. Russell Crowe is superb as John Nash, a schizophrenic math genius who descends into madness and makes his way out again with determination and the help of his wife and friends. The Math content within can be appreciated even if you don't understand it, and the acting is extraordinary. <BR>Jennifer Connelly shines like a beacon in a role it seems she was made to play, and Ed Harris convincingly portrays an imaginary 'man in black'. The setting is also very realistic and the music illustrates perfectly and fits every scene. Forget Lord of the Rings - this film in my mind already has won 'Best Picture'.
B0000630BT|5.0|Painkiller is without question one of if not the best priest album ever.  And the album just got alot better with the bonus tracks.  Living bad dreams is the best track from all of the bonus tracks on the remasters.  I think this song could have been a big hit for the band.  I highly recommend getting this album and of course all of the other remasters.
0345440757|2.0|This book has some good, reasonable advice.  It is primarily about how, very generally, to take care of your baby.  (It offers little advice for sicknesses, etc.)  <br />However, it's not worth buying.  It's one of those books where you get the impression that the author had about 10-20 pages worth of stuff to say, but spread it out over a whole book instead.  Skim through it in a bookstore rather than buy it.
B00005QXDD|5.0|The first time I heard D was live on SNL; they had to tone it down for live TV... if you can take the raw lyrics it is an awesome set of tracks.  His ability to thumb his nose at conventional bands and pop music is at a level above known and &quot;local&quot; upstarts.  D &amp; KG show their vocal prowress at entertaining listeners on both an intellectual and simpleton type of enjoyment.  Give them a try if you are open-minded to a different type of (un)political sense of humor in lyrical creativeness.  PB
B000000W5L|5.0|Rolling Stone magazine once rated Exile On Main St. as the SECOND best rock album of all time - behind the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper. Sgt. Pepper may be a beginning to end masterpiece, but its psychedelic stylings sound so dated today. Exile stands the test of time and deserves to be the best rock album ever.<br />I have one warning: If you have never heard this album, you will wonder why everyone thinks its so great after your first listen. Exile suffered cruel reviews when it was first released, and now rock critics unanimously agree that it's the Stones' best, if not the best rock album of all time. You, too, will have to go through the same process. The &quot;garage&quot;-ness of the sound forces you to listen again and again to find the brilliance in the music. It took me literally years to fully appreciate this album. All great works of art are the same in this regard.
B000063UR2|5.0|A viewer in New Jersey wrote a review that states that the incorrect soundtrack was affixed to the new release. This is untrue. The original soundtrack was penned by Jerry Goldsmith, but the movie tested poorly in the U.S. with this soundtrack so it was replaced with the other version by Tangerine Dream.<br />This movie is so visually stunning that there has not been one like it since.  Fantasy is so hard to capture without being smarmy, and I do believe that it is harmless to have a film that portrays good triumphing over evil, cliche though it may be. If for no other reason, this film is worth viewing for it's intense scenery, costume and atmosphere. The Unicorns are so believeable and mesmerising.  You will not be disappointed, faeries, sprites, evil hags, love and goodness and the reverse, evil darkness all make this a very memorable film and a must see for anyone who has ever believed that love can conquer anything if you only have enough faith.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie is literally one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is touching, funny, and beautiful.  I've seen some reviewers complain about the lack of graphic violence, saying that its absence is \\"sugar-coating\\" the reality of nazi death camps.  However, I find that the film is just as effective without it.  One of its other selling points is that it isn't too long.  Most movies with this subject matter are way too long and tend to drag on endlessly.  I enthusiastically recommend this movie to everyone.  Just a note for anyone wary of a movie with subtitles: I watched it in Italian with English subtitles and didn't find them at all distracting.
6304509154|5.0|I've just found out about the death of the late Heather O'Rourke and I saw her for the first time when Poltergeist 3 was TV. As i had'nt seen the first and second I searched everywhere to find it and watched Poltergeist. I did'nt think I was going to like it as it was an old movie, but, i did. I absolutely loved it. The acting is brilliany, everyone is great and the way it is set it is like it's real life. I really loved this movie, but Poltergeist III was definately the best !!!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I had been recommended this movie by two different people, and boy, was this the best recommendation of a film I've had in awhile!!! Before I actually started watching this, I sat in the darkness of my living room and opened my mind.  I told myself that I have no expectations.  It is going to be different, yes, but that is why I am watching it.<br />Richard Kelly is so amazingly creative!!! He is the Quention Tarentino of the new Millennium!!!  While this movie is not violent like Pulp Fiction, it's screenplay is just as original.<br />\\"Donnie Darko\\" certainly may not be the feel good movie of the year nor was it a blockbuster hit.  It is now my favorite movie.<br />Why?  Well, first off, it is unique and I am so tired of the usual romantic comedy or the formulatic action/adventure that has come out in the past year.  2001 had so many movies come out of it that i just did not care for.  This film is one of the select few that really moved me and made me think and was also very intensly entertaining.  If you are of the group of people that just wants to have some silly laughs or want something light and airy, this isn't a movie for you.  I do often like to laugh, and did find myself laughing a few times at this movie, but it is so original>  It's a beautiful story that is told through Donnie's mind.<br />Secondly, the acting is brilliant.  Jake Gyllenhaal, also of the moronic \\"Bubble Boy\\", is utterly amazing and so in tune to his character, Donnie Darko.  It's as if the character was written for him.  The expressions he makes often appear a bit creepy, but he isn't supposed to be competely sane.  Donnie is, however, a good person, and Jake makes him seem so real and true.  I pay a great deal of attention to what the characters say and do in movies, and I think that Donnie Darko is one of the greatest characters ever written.  Sure he may have some emotional problems, but he is a nice guy who in some respect is willing to do anything for someone he loves.  The film itself is set in October 1988, and Donnie, who is on medication for emotional problems, has this very frightening and menacing looking bunny rabbitt called Frank come to him into a dream.<br />Frank makes Donnie do things, things that maybe in Donnie's mind may seem like the right thing to do but aren't; however, he feels there is some justification in doing them.  While he may feel this way, his school(except for one teacher, played by Drew Barrymore), and the self-help preaching Jim Cunningham, played by Patrick Swayze do not.<br />Talk about the 80's!! Swayze hasn't been in much since those days.<br />Drew Barrymore is the worst thing about this movie.  Is her character supposed to be acted so badly? I have never particularly liked her as an actress.  She was born into an acting family, and I think it is the name that has gotten her into films.  She is the executive producer of Donnie Darko, and I think that they just gave her a role in this because of that reason.  She plays Donnie's English teacher, and while her acting is pretty bad, the character is one that Donnie actually appreciates and to some extent admires.<br />Mary McDonnell, who's most celebrated work is in Passion Fish, plays Mrs. Rose Darko.  She is very good in this and convincing as the mother who feels as if she hasn't done a good job as mother to Donnie.<br />Katharine Ross plays the therapist that Donnie goes to.  She takes the role seriously, and plays it very well yet subdued.<br />No real other names stick out for me in the acting category, but all of the actors and actresses are all very good in this.  They all work very well together.<br />My other reason this is a favorite of mine is that it is set in the 1980's, which is my generation.  I was in junior high and high school then and this brings back great memories for me.<br />I think they could have made more use of 80's music in the film.  The only song I recognized is Tears for Fears, \\"Head over Heels\\".<br />The main reason I call thisfavorite is because of it's originality and it's message.  I paid very close attention to Donnie and what he says throughout the film, and I found the message to be a bit complex and hard to understand what was going on until the end.  That is all I will say.<br />One really must take this movie with a complete open mind.  I really can't classify this film into one genre, it is a bit science fiction with it's subplot about time travel, but there is so much to this movie it's just hard to classify for those who contemplate watching it.  If you are up for something completely different and go into it with a mind wide open, I think you will be very pleasantly surprised.<br />This is a sad, demented at times, powerful, and thought provoking film that was so overlooked while in theaters.  It never came anywhere near me on the big screen, only in Cambridge.<br />I rented the dvd, which was so amazingly well done.  I watched a lot of the extras, for fans of the film, it is worth buying with all the extra goodies such as deleted scenes with audio commentary.  I, myself, like to watch with the commentary on after viewing the movie as it brings me into a deeper understanding of what the filmmaker was trying to accomplish.is because of it's originality and it's message.

0312243022|4.0|I can only comment on \\"The Hours\\" in its own right, not having read Mrs Dalloway by Virginia Woolf, but in a sense this might allow me to judge the work more objectively. Whilst I undoubtedly overlook certain intricacies in the plot it is very important to mention that my enjoyment was definitely not limited by not having read \\"Mrs Dalloway\\" previously.<br />In my humble opinion, the novel is extremely cleverly constructed and appears to be the work of an utter perfectionist. Cunningham demonstrates such incredible understanding of the life, time and mind of Virginina Woolf that his historical research was clearly scrupulous. He delves into the very depths of the minds of his female characters in particular; notably those who most seem to mirror Virginia Woolf. He shows an exquisite and very delicate sensitivity to his characters, and you truly sense that he is totally at one with them all, as well as with their differing fictional worlds, each of which seems to be tainted with Virginia's sadness, isolation and reflection, despite the fact that the characters' world seems to overflow with love as well as material comforts.<br />I found the book a great pleasure to read. It really is a novel within a novel within a novel, and the three parralel plots blur around the edges. The book is all fictional, if based on reality, and yet this is three-level fiction, leading the reader to question who is whose fiction and where the lines between fiction and reality can really be drawn? We are also lead to ponder on when fiction is fantasy and when it is an outsourcing of real anguish, fear and frustration, for Virginia, and even, through Virginia and the other protaganists, for Cunningham himself? It is a multi-layered and highly thought-provoking masterpiece.

B00005V1Z5|5.0|ok, ok - maybe granny wont get a lot of the jokes, but what i mean is that its not so racy that she'd die of a stroke, but yet it is not so childish that 5-year-old Johnny cant sit down and watch it. it was an excellent flick - light and bouncy, a splash of romance, a good cast and script, and goofy, funny comedy. its one of those movies you can watch with your brother and his friends or with you and you friends at a sleepover. It was a great all around film for just a casual evening by yourself or with pals - definitely rent it! I LOVE BEN STILLER!!
B00005JKED|5.0|This is a very intense police drama that stares Denzel Washington, as the evil, very corrupt narc Alonzo Harris, and Ethan Hawke, as the \\"rookie\\", Jake Hoyt, who spends one day on the job with Alonzo.  Little does he know that Alonzo is so hard nosed, and that he joins in the drug inducing along with the creeps he is trying to bring down.<br />Jake has quite a day with Alonzo.  Washington's Alonzo is unnerving but brilliant!!  He is one of the best actors and has my deepest admiration for going against the type of characters he usually plays.  It was very brave of him to take on this role.  I found myself shocked at some of the things the character said and did, especially since he is supposed to be a police officer, but I guess they aren't all so good, and Alonzo Harris is definitely one of the baddest cops to grace the big screen.  Although, I was so amazingly entralled by this movie, I also found it difficult to watch, but couldn't stop watching because it was just so darn interesting and intense.<br />I found the acting all around was very good.  Denzel is so excellent in this.  He is such a talented actor, and I am glad he did this movie.  It really shows that he is not afraid to try any role that he finds interesting no matter how immoral that character may be.  I think it came at a good time.  He was always seen as the good guy; this proves to me that Denzel is a real actor who cares about the craft of acting.<br />Ethan Hawke was also excellent in this.  Before this movie, I had only seen him in \\"Reality Bites\\", which was a comedy.<br />Kudos to him for taking on this role!  It was a great performance.<br />This movie is so worth watching because it of the strong performances by Washington and Hawke and it's capability to keep the viewer glued to the screen.  I didn't want to take my eyes away from the screen nor get up for any reason.

B0000256VK|5.0|I got into Roxy Music in 1993 and this album blows me away, one of the best pop albums of the 80's and one of my personal top R&B albums of the 80's too. Ferry sings with such passion it seems he was channeling Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson. If you are an R&B music fan you would notice the interlocking guitars and other insturments not dominating the sound but enhancing the whole vibe. from the beautifully crafted More Than This to the samba-like title track, Manzanera while not as prominment as on other Roxy albums his guitar playing even more heroic supporting the groove and giving the songs a strong anchor. Mackay's saxophone and oboe playing is masterful and beautiful at the same time. this is the same question Funkadelic asked, who said a funk band can't play rock. Roxy Music asks who says an art-rock band can't play good soulful R&B music,the answer is yes, yes, yes.
0783246641|5.0|This movie had me in tears from start to finish. And get this: I'm not a pervert, not a sadist, and not even all that psychotic. I just couldn't get enough of the twisted-yet-lucid logic of Patrick Bateman: super-psycho-mass-murdering/GQ-mergering-aquisitiong-yuppie-SCUM. If you love to hate the eighties, you'll eat this one up.
B000009QPE|5.0|this album was one of the heaviest for its time. sure the death metal bands we have now have topped it but this one really started that form of music. while metallica and megadeth played fast they couldn't match slayer, the album is a lot heavier and intense. this is when they got a bit more serious about the lyrics, they aren't quite as cheesy and satanic as before. we still have altar of sacrifice, but they have improved. its probably my favorite thrash metal album of all time.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is quite possibly THE BEST movie ever made.  I have never before in my life judged a movie as the best and I never thought I would until I watched this film. See this movie if it's the last thing you do and see it for what it is.  Don't look for flaws because your not going to find any. It is not the participants place to say what is flawed in a film that is not thier own unless there are obvious plot holes and bad acting. Darko has neither. Keep in mind that, thanks to ''hollywood standards' forcing the director to pull out the butcher knife, there was a lot of important material cut out which can and should be watched on the DVD.  This does not change the fact that what you see when you watch Donnie Darko is perfection.  The acting is amazing, the story is entirely original and has been edited perfectly so that everything that needs to be known to make the film work flawlessly is in place.  Yes, there are quite a few movies that have amazing acting and a flawlessly edited plot and here I am saying that Donnie Darko is the best.  The reason this film is the best is this:  because the above mentioned was done in such a perfect way, you will feel every character.  You will want to know everything about even the most uninvolved character.  Every character could so easily be the main character in their own movie and you will want to see their movies.  This is extremely rare in a film.  In fact I can't think of a single movie where it's done as perfectly as in Darko.  A masterpiece does not happen often especially in a day and age when people think less and less before they act.  Please, take full advantage of this masterpiece.  And for those of you who can fully understand and appreciate what I am saying in this review, spread the word about Donnie Darko....THE BEST movie ever made.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I'd seen the seen the movie several times before getting the DVD.  Watching it on DVD does enhance the experience.  The background music blends in a lot better.  Little things like the loud tapping of feet and a whooshing sound effect when Scott is doing his &quot;crowd pleasings steps&quot; are nice extras that Dolby 5.1 brings to the experience.  Luhrman's commentary is nice although he tends to go off on tangents which can be frustrating when you really want him to concentrate on the movie and give his insight on certain scenes.  <br />The documentary is nice side dish and overall a good effort for an independent film and a good effort by Mirimax giving this movie proper justice releasing it on DVD, finally.
B00000JZIK|5.0|Old fashioned noir matched with the current fascination with trick endings plus very good acting, excellent writing, and superior camera work= The Usual Suspects. This is a thriller on lots of levels.
0064407667|4.0|I can't say this was my favorite book in the series, but its wrothy of at least 3 1/2 *stars. If you read this series in order starting with the first, you may not get the best impression of the rest of the series. The story's simple enough to follow to be able to start with any volume of this \\"woeful series\\". I read first the 5th and 6th, 7th and 8th, then the first four...At first I was skeptical about the series, after hearing that it wasn't as good as Harry Potter, but I have gotten more \\"into\\" this series than any other I have before.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This album by Dream Theater easily eclipses any album released in the last five years.  &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; is an outright masterpiece.  The musicianship of the band is phenominal.  Dream Theater proves that you can play with an aggressive style and still be melodic, something lacking from every nu-metal band on the planet.  If you are a nu-metal fan, repent your sins, burn your Slipknot and Mudvayne CD's, and open your eyes to the musical perfection that is Dream Theater.
1563890119|4.0|The strangest thing for me about Sandman, and in particular, this book, also serves quite nicely as a review of the book's merits. <br />When I originally bought Preludes, on a whim, I expected not to like it, but was quickly blown away...by the characters, the writing, and indeed the entire world. However, several weeks later, after exhausting my after-christmas cash buying and reading the next three volumes of the series, I decided to reread Preludes.... And came away surprisingly disappointed.<br />Oh, the book is good. Make no mistake of that. The book is quite excellent. It's simply that the rest of the Sandman series is so far beyond excellent it's sailing the seas of genius, and Preludes, where Neil Gaiman was still perfecting his craft and settling into his world, can't quite reach their level.<br />But if Preludes isn't quite the crown jewels, it's still quite a gem, and an essential gem at that. It's in this that the stage is set, where we meet Dream of the Endless, one of the seven beings who I would call God-like, except for the fact that it's gone into in the series just how the Endless and Gods differ. And in the first story in this book occurs the event which will ultimately go on to shape the rest of the series: Dream's lengthy imprisonment. His escape and struggle to reclaim his lost Kingdom and stolen tools form the bulk of the rest of the book, and are sprinkled lavishly with cameos from such widely ranging parties as John Constantine, Lucifer, and the JLI. This is also the book when, as Neil Gaiman's style finally cemented, we are also introduced to Dream's sister Death, who is almost resoundingly acknowledged as one of the best characters in the series.<br />Preludes also features an overtone of horror that grows fainter and more infrequent as the books go on, so any horror fan should definitely try this one: in addition to the much-mentioned 24 Hours, I found Imperfect Host's scenes of Cain and Abel to be particularly creepy.<br />So my recommendation is to, by all means, start with Preludes & Nocturnes. Just don't *stop* with it; the ride only gets better after this. It might be worth only 4 stars to me in comparison with the rest of the series, but it's worth 5 in comparison to anything else.
0790738139|4.0|Here's guessing you'll never see Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, Danny DeVito and Kim Bassinger in the same movie ever again. It would cost way too much. LA Confidential is conisistantly provocative and entertaining, a mix Hollywood almost never gets right. The acting is tip-top, and the plot is as well. Also, this is a mivie you get more out of the more times you see it, so you might as well buy it.
B000002GEV|5.0|This album by Supertramp is their best work and a true classic which will go on and on. It can be compared with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" by Pink Floyd in this regard.The songs are dynamic and and vary dramatically throughout the album. There are no losers on this album, each song adding to the total value. A \\"must have\\" for any rock album collection.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I didn't buy this record expecting it to be &quot;groundbreaking&quot;, and maybe that's why I like it so much. The Strokes aren't breaking any new ground here, they're just making music they like, and that's how it should be. The songs are great. Good lyrics, melodic, and well crafted in simplicity. It's just a little rock and roll. It's simple, it rocks, and you end up singing along. In my book that's a damn good record. I don't buy music looking for salvation and &quot;the next big thing&quot;. I buy what I like. And so should you. So forget about hype, it's music. It's catchy, it's smart without being pretentious, and it just sounds good. My personal favorites: Someday, Alone Together, Hard to Explain, and Take it or Leave it. Okay kids, now it's up to you.
B00005T30L|1.0|This movie [stunk]. It's about a teenage girl that purposefully alieantes herself from the rest of the world. Her and her bast friend refure to take part in normal teenage activities, always putting them down as soooo stupid. I could not idenitfy with the movie at all. Thora Birch is supposed to be a Holden Caufield-type character and almost pulls it off, but then again, I didn't enjoy Catcher In the Rye, either.
6305627347|5.0|What Cheech and Chong are to the stoner comedy, South Park is to the tripper comedy. With bizarre juxtipositions of ideas, to insanely silly musical numbers, to just plain dumb jokes, with a self-awareness of how dumb they are, it's clear that these guys have eaten a bit of paper in their time. I don't think any comedy has ever been so inspired from beginning to end. It's too bad the show hasn't maintained the same high level.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney has become my absolute favorite female singer after a slow development of listening to her music, and ONLY her music, starting with the album, 'Britney'. She has become my absolute favorite female singer Of All Time. This album is another awesome album by Britney with probably my favorite song by hers, \\"Stronger\\". That song is so hard it's almost as hard as a heavy metal song. The title track is awesome, too. The songs flow really well, too. All the songs have superb beats, sounds, and her beautiful, characteristic singing that totally sets her apart from ALL other female singers. Her voice has such incredible, INFINITE depth and feeling. You totally FEEL her music and singing in this album and in all of her albums.
B0000024RQ|5.0|Even if Bob Dylan had never released another album after his 1963 sophomore effort, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, his place in the history of twentieth century music history would be perfectly secure. The album is an absolutely landmark for folk music.<br />It is not Mr. Dylan's approach that makes the LP so exciting. The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is the sound of a folk singer doing what folk singers have always done: sing to the common people of what is going on across the country.  It was the alarming developments going on across the country that was so exciting. The Cuban Missile Crisis had just past, Vietnam was right around the corner, and, as the nuclear arms race escalated, everything seemed as if it could be gone tomorrow. Meanwhile, a new generation was arising, one that would test the uncharted waters of post-WWII society, inherit a world on the brink and decide how the norms must change to meet a tomorrow than never seemed more different than yesterday. It was a brave new world and someone had to sing about it.<br />Mr. Dylan was the first folk artist to show an understanding of the more terrifying and far-reaching changes that were engulfing the world around him. Resounding with a poet's clear-headed sharpness and folkie's wide-eyed innocence, dazzling Freewheelin' songs such as \\"Masters of War,\\" \\"Talkin' World War III Blues,\\" \\"Oxford Town\\" \\"I Shall Be Free,\\" \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" and \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" brilliantly recapitulated this fascinating atmosphere. Sometimes Mr. Dylan's approach was wry and zany. \\"Talkin' World War III Blues\\" is a tongue-in-cheek recount of jaunting across a postapocalyptic city while \\"I Shall Be Free\\" places a merry drunk in the world of JFK and air raid drills. Sometimes it was gravely serious. \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" is an open-hearted pat-on-the-back to troubled denizens of the day while \\"Masters of War\\" is perhaps the most scathing insult to callous, warlord politicians ever put into verse. No matter what his tone, no songwriter had a greater grasp on the almost incomprehensible times than the brilliant, young Mr. Dylan. He may not have been the first somewhat politically minded folk-singer but he was the first with the intelligence, skill and bravery to face, head-on, many of the more overwhelming troubles that had recently entered the world. To put it bluntly, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is the sound of folk music entering the second half of the twentieth century.<br />Not every song on album is steeped in revolution, though. An album so densely coated in insight and immensity would boggle the mind so Mr. Dylan treats us to some quaint, more traditionally minded, gems about love and wanderin' between the heavier songs. \\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\\" and \\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\" are easy-going country ramblers while \\"Girl from the North Country\\" and \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\" are sincere, mournful dirges. The greatest of Freewheelin's personal songs, however, is \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright,\\" a shove-off to an former lover that features Mr. Dylan's seething wit at its best.<br />The songs of the Freewheelin' Bob Dylan sparked a sensation. In the coming years they would be covered countless times, chanted at protest rallies and on street corners and their messages would be incorporated into the values of a new generation. The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is the seminal force of folk music entering a new era, stronger than ever.
6302816580|4.0|When I 1st saw this movie I was sooo disappointed...being the HUGE Sylvester Stallone fan that I am I was expecting most of what I saw but it seemed to pathetic to begin with...how realistc is it that a truck driver would also be a professional arm wrestler? The main story of Sly trying to win over the love of his son is heartfelt and sweet but with consideration to the movie I decided to watch it for a secound time and realized that it's a better movie the secound time you see it. You become more open-minded to the odd plot and you accpet the flaws that appear throughout this family film.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|What an excellent recording. I love to listen to this at work. Since most of it is instrumental, it makes it easier to concentrate on other things. It contains some very powerful pieces, as well as some light-hearted ones. One of the best original-score soundtracks
B000001ESP|2.0|Fellow musicians may admire their radiant technical abilities but, to most of us, Geddy Lee, Neil Peart and Alex Lifeson, better known as Rush, make a pretty hideous combination. Not only are Mr. Lee's high-pitched vocals capable of startling every canine within a five mile-radiance of his revolting shriek, but his lyrics are some of the most pretentious, ridiculous and overtechnical blather in rock history. In the background, Mr. Peart and Mr. Lifeson meander on, spewing instrumentation that is as clean-cut and precise as one could hope, but does not have a drop of soul. A gratuitous layer of synthesizers completes this smooth, anti-septic product. Even Moving Pictures, their most accessible album (that at least spares listeners the Ayn Rand garbage) is an overglossed, hollow, lifeless creation. I may not know how to tune a guitar by ear or how to use a capo but I think I can tell that Rush is a...band.
B00004STDN|5.0|hey...being the big Sylvester Stallone fan that I am I found this to be one of his best movies...sure he has his pathetic attempts to be funny but thats what makes him so cool! <BR>The movie its kinda gory in cetain parts they don't hide anything when fights and guns begin to go start so be prepared for that. All in all this is a great movie it has a story to it and isn't all about strength@
0780020685|5.0|Wow, Criterion has done it again. What a great package. First off, the movie is phenonmenal. If you see the movie, you will want a copy of it. If you see this collection, you will want it. The commentary is first rate, with lots of interesting behind the scenes information. The fact that you can listen to the commentary while reading the subtitles is a great bonus.<br />If you have never seen the movie, I don't think you will be disappointed if you give it a try.
B00003CXUM|2.0|Wong Kar-Wai's dramatic romance \\"IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE\\" set in 1960's Hong Kong stars Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung as married friends who discover their respective spouses are having an affair. This beautifully filmed, sophisticated love story has won a trunk load of awards. The profusive two disc set is up to Criterion's high standards and includes hours of extras and wonderful documentary on the making of the film. For an alternative tale that sets up simlar circumstances but goes in a deliciously dangerous direction, see Chabrol's \\"CRY OF THE OWL.\\"
B00005QZ7U|1.0|My husband and I tried to watch this movie in a Montreal theater. Tried...because we couldn't endure more than 30 minutes of that mindless cacophony. We simply had to leave. It felt too much like watching commercials non-stop - no single scene lasted longer than three seconds. One can easily see similar parallels in the use of music. Acting?.. What acting?
B00005OM4N|5.0|My 2 friends and I bought this cd after we saw CROSSROADS for the 2nd time and we are men ages 10-12. The best songs are trackes #2-Overproteced,#4 I'm not a girl not yet a woman,and #7 I love ROCK-N-ROLL. AND ANYONE THAT DOES NOT LIKE CROSSROADS OR THIS CD ARE ....<BR>                                      fROM BRITNEY Fans
B00005RYLE|5.0|This is the seminal movie in demonic possession. While films such as the excorcist survive on nothing more than overated reputation, evil dead rises to the top as a film that still delivers the goods today. I won't waste time on the story itself because more than likely, if your thinking of buying this DVD, you've seen the movie. This book of the dead edition is how the film should have been released in the first place. In an undying quest for profits however, all films must be released twice, an original followed by a \\"special edition\\". This is a blatent cash grab but i digress. This Version is outstanding. The film looks amazing (I have an old VHS copy and the difference in quality is unbelievable) and sounds even better. What can be better than the sound of rotting flesh splattering on the ground in all its fetid glory? This remastering really brings out all the little details like that. As well, there is an abundance of special features that actually add to the experience. Not just the usual deleted scenes. Folks..theres a reason in these things that scenes were deleted! Here, there is an insightful commentary by Bruce Campbell that actually is worth listening to! Theres also a cool featurette on Fanatacism. The other featurette on the roots of evil dead is dull but has some cool stills. Then there is the obligatory alternate takes and deleted scenes. However, these weren't added as some kind of hidden gem. The 'cuts' are obviously horrible and are quite funny to watch.One of them has a scene where the woman attacked by the tree branch is walking around the room growling and the voice effects weren't added in yet. Very funny. worth the purchase. wish they would have released it this way the first time.
0380817683|4.0|What a great read!  Keyes depiction of addiction is sobering!  I loved the point of view and how Rachel's reality unfolds oh so subtly!  Coupled with Keyes' wry sense of humor, this book will make you laugh out loud and cry with compassion for this tortured character.  My first experience with Marian Keyes has left me looking for more of her work!  I'd definitely recommend to anyone with a curiousity about alcholism and addiction to investigate this as a great story of recovery and self-redemption.
B00002SSRZ|1.0|This version of Abraxas is most diappointing! The bass seems to have got lost - at least on a Bose loudspeaker set. Apart from the missing bass the music is remixed and sounds quite weird, not at all what the normal recordings sound like. I'm sure Abraxas could sound great in Surround - this version most certainly does not...
B000062Y98|5.0|I was recently turned on to this album when I was at the store and gave it a listen at the &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; station.  I was seriously impressed by it.  I loved the solid and hard-hitting drumming of many of the 80's &amp; 90's metal bands, and was refreshed to hear it again.  The band makes great use of a choir with their music. (Don't worry.  No need to break out those old church hymnals)  Furthermore, I was impressed by the use of guitar effects, other than distortion, which added much to the sound.  Overall, it delivers a very full sound without sounding muddy.<br />The highlights of the album, in my opinion, are: &quot;Under the Ice&quot;,  &quot;The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight&quot;, and &quot;And Then There Was Silence.&quot;  The last track I just mentioned is the longest song on the album, being over 14 minutes.  It is, however, all worth the time to listen to, along with the rest of the album.<br />Lastly, there is a bonus track on the version of the album I bought called &quot;Mies Del Dolor.&quot;  It means, &quot;Hervest of Sorrow.&quot;  I believe the song is in Italian.  There is an English version of the song on the CD single for &quot;And Then There Was Silence.&quot;  All in all, there are 6 versions of the song.  2 in English, 2 in Spanish, one in Italian, and one in French.  This track is just beautfully done.  It is a great song and, alone, makes the album worth the price.
B00003CXUM|5.0|I had never seen \\"In the Mood for Love\\" and to be quite honest, was never a fan of Wong Kar Wai..I always found him to be a bit pretentious; as if he were trying to force Westernized techniques and cinematic fads into a Chinese mold...I never understood what the big deal about \\"Chungking Express\\" was...except for a totally awesome cover of the Cranberries \\"Dreams\\" in Cantonese by Faye Wong...<br />Well, with that said, I loved \\"In the Mood for Love.\\"  Dreamy and sensual filled with rich fabrics and colors and music, it is truly a feast for the eyes ears and senses.  The story is heartbreaking, of two people who you just KNOW will never be together...this is well-established by the restricted mannerisms they adapt and the concern of image and reputation.   I don't even think they were fighting their feelings, but instead, they gently rode them out until it got to the point where it was just skirting a bit too close to the edge.<br />You probably have heard lots on the beauty of the film, which is why you are here reading customer reviews, right?  Or you must be a die-hard Criterion junkie.  But folks, this 2-disk set is THE most impressive package I have ever seen from Criterion.<br />Why?<br />Because on the second disk, you see Wong Kar Wai filming and you see the rehearsals and tons of deleted scenes that never made it onto the final cut.  And these are especially significant because they show us what a different film this could have been.  I am not sure if \\"In the Mood for Love\\" was a happy accident (which you may conclude after watching all the supplemental material), but I can say that the scenes that didnt make it shed a whole new light on the scenes that did.  You see Maggie and Tony reading the same lines in different settings, switching their lines, you see Tony's utter ease with Wong's method and you see Maggie's obvious discomfort (watch the Toronto Press Conference to hear a very guarded and careful statement by Maggie and then hear Wong Kar Wai say in the documentary that he and Maggie didn't hit it off from the get go for some hoots).<br />Pages of background by a noted historian puts the full story into the context of time and allows us to see why WKW set his story set pieces in particular years.  Posters, conceptual art, trailers, its all there...and in French too!  And check out the Russian one-sheet under promo materials to see a look that is totally different from those of America and Asia and Europe...<br />And the beautifully illustrated booklet with a short story that was a source for the film is another added bonus...<br />Folks..this is without a doubt one of the most beautiful packages ever.  This movie didn't make me a fan of WKW, but you definitely walk away with fresh perspectives and a great education!<br />Don't miss out! And watch out for my review of \\"Rashomon\\" coming soon!
B00005LMBK|5.0|this is gonna b a kwik review. this album is 1 of the best I hav ever herd. most of the songs r grate. espeshely 19-2000, Clint Eastwood, Rock The House and Genious. ignor the rest and by this album (even if its onli for the cool karacters).
B00005JKQX|5.0|Russell Crowe was meant to play this amazing character.  He captivates his audience with this oscar-worthy performance.  He shows what it is like to have this often misunderstood disease.  He is able to get into the mind of Mr. Nash and show the stress and anxiety that occurs on a daily basis for people with schizophrenia.  I have a family member with this disease.  It is often difficult to cope and to understand him.  This movie brought tears to my eyes because I felt I wasn't alone-there are others that have to cope as well.
B00000DFSK|5.0|This is U2 at their best! Buy it, you'll like it for sure.
B000062Y98|3.0|...but &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; just doesn't do it for me.  I still love &quot;And Then There Was Silence.&quot;  To me, that's one of the most impressive songs BG have written, and that's saying something.  The rest of the album relies too heavily on multi-tracked vocals, which bring the album's overall appeal down for me.  Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.  The songs &quot;Precious Jerusalem,&quot; &quot;Sadly Sings Destiny,&quot; and &quot;The Soulforged&quot; are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD.  Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
B000001FA4|5.0|Here it is March 2002, and I am ordering another copy of this. Why? ....I've played the other one so much that I think I finally wore it out. That speask for itself.
0060506989|5.0|This is a riveting work. It is a &quot; true war story&quot; --a  work of  courage, integrity, and finally love.  But please,  why change the cover on the  lastest edition of the book? I like Mel Gibson  in the movie just fine-- but   there was no need to &quot;sell&quot; the  work  by putting his face on the cover of the book. Shame on you Harpers!
0380002930|5.0|I'm just chiming in to back up some of the younger reviewers below.  This is an excellent book, definitely one of my top ten.  I was 46 when I first read the book, and it spoke eloquently to me.  I think I'm going to start rereading it tonight...
B0000630BT|4.0|This one truly is my favorite album of theirs. A very hard melodic and agressive album that they didnt make since the<BR>\\"Screamin\\" album and it was their last with Rob Halford. I got the remastered one and it sounds better the bonus track is probably the best on these re-masters. However mine has an error on \\"Touch of evil\\". Right around 1:36 the song stops for about 2 seconds as if someone paused it or edited it. so im taking that up with their Defects Dept. I wish their was albums like this in today's music
B0000027RL|5.0|I have grown up with ACDC, metallica, Guns n' roses and Pearl jam. Now that I am 22 years of age and (almost) grown up, I realise that Pearl Jam makes the greatest music in the world. I slowly got tired og Metallica and ACDC, but Pearl Jams music stayed in my head. I never get sick of the soaring screaming from Mr. Eddie Vedder. This CD is the very beginning of my favourite group and what a start! This is not their best cd, I like Vs and Yield better. But ten is where we find the strong emotions and the recognicable songs. Even Flow, Alive and Jeremy are songs we all know and know well, but these are not the greatest song on this album. You would think that when you get sick of Alive and jeremy, you get sick of pearl jam. That is not how it is. On this album you find songs like Garden, Release, Oceans and of course Black. Black might be the greatest song ever written and the execution of it is exellent. It makes the even stronger! <br />This is a challenge to all you who thought pearl jam was only \\"alive\\" and \\"jeremy\\". That are only small names. Pearl jam on the other hand, is a legend!
B000002UAR|5.0|on the surface, i'd say this is the greatest pop album ever made.  but it seems to go much deeper than that.  there is something extremely haunting about this album.  in the right mood, songs like I'm Only Sleeping and She Said She Said will fill you with a strange emptiness while nudging you towards fulfillment at the same time.  a bit too esoteric maybe, but that's the only way i can describe it.<br />whether you love or hate the beatles, their influence on music and society in general is undeniable.. and in my opinion, this album shows that influence more clearly than any of their others.
B00005NEUF|2.0|I'm sorry, but hailing The Strokes as a &quot;modern Velvet Underground&quot; and comparing them to THE STOOGES is just plain wrong. Being a major fan of both VU and the Stooges, I feel saddened that rock critics have stooped to the level of comparing The Strokes to these bands. First of all, I see absolutely no comparison at all between The Strokes and the Stooges. The Strokes have none of the rawness and genuine emotion of the Stooges and are not even in the same league as the Stooges. As for the Velvet Underground, I guess the Strokes are big fans of them and attempt to sound like them, but fail miserably. The Strokes' songwriting, compositions, creativity level, and values are no where near The Velvet Underground's, who in their own right made at least 3 untouchable, classic albums that put &quot;Is this It?&quot; to shame. <BR>If I was going to judge this album on its own merit, without considering any of the hype or utterly false comparisons, honestly I would have to say that &quot;Is This It?&quot; is fairly dull and emotionless, with an occasional good melody here and there. As my friend puts it, The Strokes simply &quot;play their instruments.&quot;
B000002UAX|5.0|this album changed my life.  i think that's fair to say.  <br />when i was 10 years old, i was going through my grandmother's attic looking at my mother's old records.  among the ones i decided to take out and listen to were The Doors-Waiting for the Sun, Silver Apples-Silver Apples, The Incredible String Band-The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, The Beatles-Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band, and... the White Album.  <br />This is the one i listened to first, because something about the cover art, or rather, lack thereof, struck me as odd.  I suffered through all the pops and skips of the 20 year old vinyl, almost not even noticing that they were there.. and when it was over, i had no idea what i had just heard.  all i knew was that i'd never heard anything like it before... i had never  heard anything even almost like it.  the next album i listened to was Sgt. Pepper, because i wanted to see how the band that made &quot;i wanna hold your hand&quot; could be capable of making such strange music.  by the time sgt. pepper was over, i was hooked.  i had to get my hands on every post Rubber Soul album.  I'm still not a big fan of the beatles' early work.. but Rubber Soul and everything after is pure genius.  If you've never heard this album before, please.. do yourself a favor and buy it.  if you don't like it you can always give it as a gift.

B000002J09|5.0|By 1971 Led Zeppelin were no longer strangers to the music industry.  They were one of the leading bands during that time and it was a big year for rock 'n roll.  Led Zeppelin's fourth album is arguably one of their greatest.  It only had eight tracks but these songs defined rock 'n roll music.<br />Although truly Led Zeppelin IV is not a huge change from the group's previous albums it is none the less one of the band's best albums.  It has more variety than their earlier albums.  Whether it be hard rockers like Led Zeppelin I or II or beauitful acoustics similar to Led Zeppelin III this album has both styles.<br />The opening track BLACK DOG is a huge rock classic that has been considered by many one of Zeppelin's best tunes.<BR>ROCK 'N ROLL basically defines the genre of music as wild raw and raunchy.  BATTLE OF EVERMORE is amazing check out the mandolin!  Of course everyone knows STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN Led Zeppelin's most popular song and it was never released as a single!  MISTY MOUNTAIN HOP is a fun tune.  I find FOUR STICKS is kind of repetitive and the weakest song here but it is still listenable.  GOING TO CALIFORNIA is a beautiful acoustic ballad with a touch of mandolin.  And finally WHEN THE LEVEE BREAKS is an awesome hard rock closer.<br />In conclusion Led Zeppelin IV is perhaps the band's best album although it is not my personal favourite (Led Zeppelin II is for me) it is definelty one of the group's finest works.<BR>The bottom line is if you don't have this album you are not a true Led Zeppelin fan because this is truly a Rock 'n roll monument!  Highly recommended!

0385484518|5.0|One of the best book I've ever read. I am extremely touched by such a sincere and loving relationship between a teacher and his student. I was moved to tears in the last few chapters. Can't stress enough, but this is really a must-read.
B00005OAIE|5.0|...This is the best new album I have. The songs on the album are great. John is one of the few artists out there who was any real talent anymore. The song's have a great tone to them. The melodies get stuck in my head all day. You can't go wrong with it. With the Britney Spears and N'Syncs of today, people don't appreciate good music when they hear it. I hope Ricky doesn't do this for a living, he may want to get a new job.
0375704027|4.0|Norwegian Wood is my the first book by Murakami that I've read, and without a doubt it will not be the last.  To be honest, I was a little skeptical after reading the first chapter, and almost let it go after this point, but a few days later I picked up Norwegian Wood again, and am very glad that I did.  Murakami's exploration of human psychology and sexuality is brilliant and authentic, and although I have no way of comparing Norwegian Wood to his other works, I find it unfortunate that some are contending that this novel is \\"too conventional\\" and not up to par with his other works.  Norwegian Wood is an excllent book in its own right.
B00005JKED|5.0|Training Day is the best cop film and one of the best motion pictures created. This the tale of one rookie cop who teams up for his &quot;training day&quot; with a unstable cop played by Denzel Washington who knows the streets like back of his hand. What is supposed to be a simple training for a rookie cop turns into a battle on the streets. The performances in this films are amazing. Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke deserve Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. I recommend this film to everyone. It is one of the best films of 2001.
B00005U2LM|4.0|There's not much to say 'bout this. All the joints are cool. &quot;Y'all Been Warned&quot;, &quot;Uzi(Pinky Ring)&quot;, &quot;Rules&quot; and &quot;Chrome Wheels&quot; excel from the other joints. A solid four star album. Buy this even if u wouldn't be a huge Wu fan.
B000021XR5|5.0|My favorite album from my favorite band (but like I've said, that could change in a matter of days), though it took some time. I got it in June of '01, and on the first listen I must say that it scared me a little. The first few times you listen to it, I'll almost guarantee you won't like it. That was the case for a lot of people I know. The second time I gave it a listen it felt like I had just taken some drug and had a bad trip. Or maybe it was the heat and sleep deprivation. Whatever. Anyway, after a while it really grows on you, and you start to hang on to the dark, angry beauty of the songs. The album is made up of:<br />A) Songs about drug addiction<br />B) Songs about divorce<br />C) Songs that don't make the least bit of sense<br />And those are always the most fun. \\"MC5\\" is a fun, fast song that includes guitarist Dean DeLeo exclaiming \\"I broke a string!\\" in a strange voice at the end--cracks me up every time. \\"I Got You\\" has sort of a hippie vibe to it. \\"Atlanta\\" is a groovy, slightly creepy one with an acoustic base, which I still say Incubus ripped off for one of their new songs (\\"Mexico\\"). \\"Heaven & Hot Rods\\" is pure adrenaline--good for headbanging. \\"Glide\\" is most likely the best on the album--slow and moody, another creepy one. It sounds almost otherworldly, sort of like a darker \\"Still Remains\\", and is exactly 5 minutes long which I think is cool for some reason. Every song on No. 4 is excellent once you get used to the album. I quite enjoy it. This is an album every rock fan needs. Go get it next time you go cd shopping. Enjoy.
B000002HJA|5.0|A huge Kyuss fan, this one is my favorite.  Many others will disagree, but I think it may be their best.  Their sound comes full circle on this one and their creativity here comes to a peak. <br />Joe Barresi's engineering is excellent, capturing their massive wall of sound.  Sonically, this album sounds better than the others (which seem too low-end heavy).  This album seems to flow better in concept than some of the other albums, too.<br />A great variety of tunes and Josh's guitar playing is excellent as usual.<br />Go get this album now!
B000060MMI|5.0|&quot;Drunken Lullabies&quot; is another absolutely magnificent album from Flogging Molly.<br />Dave King and Co. are back with all the frantic energy and irish pride that gained them so many fans in their debut album, &quot;Swagger.&quot; Old fans will be instantly familiar with the kicking sound of the title track &quot;Drunken Lullabies&quot; and the much more laid back &quot;If I Ever Leave This World Alive,&quot; which brings back memories of &quot;The Worst Day Since Yesterday.&quot; The high energy tracks continue with a great new song, &quot;The Kilburn High Road&quot;  and a great studio rendition of &quot;Swagger.&quot;<br />Where this album outshines it's predecessor, however, is in the final few tracks, which really give an indication how the band is growing musically and has tons of potential to be even better. &quot;Another Bag of Bricks&quot; has a great sound that is very distinct and different from a lot of the other stuff Flogging Molly has done before...it represents a great middle ground between the frantic tracks like &quot;Lullabies&quot; and &quot;The Kilburn High Road&quot; and the slower &quot;If I Ever Leave This World Alive.&quot; <br />The final track, &quot;The Son Never Shines (On Closed Doors),&quot; is Flogging Molly at it's best...Lyrics sung by King with the kind of emotion and beauty that hit you square in the heart. Songs like this make me think that the best is definately yet to come from these guys and the road there is going to be musical magic.<br />All in all, &quot;Drunken Lullabies&quot; is an awesome CD that deserves attention and respect. Order it and find the Irishman in you...
0385484518|5.0|News about suicide of teens upsets me. There must be something wrong with the society, with us adults and with the whole educational system. We should be so ashamed of ourselves when we find someone like Morrie who valued his life so much and made the best of it till the very last drop, and we do so little to help and save the lost ones. 99% of life's problems can be solved, and we should send this message out to the world loud and clear, especially to the teenagers and the deprived societies.<br /><br />p.s. As a pro trader, I had been in a losing streak since the beginning of 2002. However, with Morrie's brilliant example, I will fight on. Thanks to you Morrie. God Bless you in heaven!
B000002ADT|5.0|I don't think that anyone should give this CD anything less than 5 stars, especially if they don't know the first thing about jazz.  I am not an expert myself, but I know enough about it to say that is is probably in the top 5 best jazz albums ever made.  These other people that say that it's boring and that it makes them sleepy have had their musical tastes honed by Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys.  True jazz is unlike any other type of music.  These people look for guitar solos or even a chorus!!  I liken this situation to an old man who listens to polka to rate the music of Pearl Jam.  This old man just won't get it.  If you don't love it, you just don't get it!!  Go back to your manufactured cliched dollops of musical manure and leave the jazz music to people who understand it.  Jazz is a state of mind and a true American-made art form.

630441403X|5.0|I guess you can't be all things to all people, and this movie is a good example.  With all the good things that have been said about it, there are still a lot of people who really hate it.  To each their own, I guess. <br />First, about Las Vegas itself.  I do know that when we lived in Illinois, my wife and I must have watched the film fifteen times together.  We now live in Las Vegas, where we are raising four children.  No, the film did not make the decision for us to move, but I'll admit we were mesmerized by the town's portrayal that you don't see in tourist brochures, and between us, we had been tourists as least a dozen times.   While Las Vegas has plenty of openings for Boulevard of Broken Dreams, as any large city does, it's still a rollicking fun town to live in. The movie only portrays what two people made of it.     <br />The biggest reason people trash seem to trash the movie seems to be that it is a depressing downer.  I guess I can't argue with that statement.  However, my personal definition of art is portraying human emotion differently (within reason) or better than it's been done before.  Since this film covers human emotion big time, and wrings you out like a dishrag by the time it's over, I would classify it as art, and very good art.<br />To the accusation that the two characters are two glamorous, I don't agree, and even if they are, so what?  Tragedies are supposed to be great dramas (i.e, Hamlet, Romeo & Juliet), and we have a whopper here with a guy who had an incredibly good job and a family, and lost it all.  No, we don't see him puking all over the place, as his condition would suggest, but he does describe exactly those symptoms.   As for Elizabeth Shue being too good-looking for the role, trust me, she's not.   While she might be an above-average looking streetwalker, she's run-of-the-mill compared to the absolute knockouts that ply their trade in this town.  This is not to say she's not beautiful, but she does dress down for the role.<br />The rape scene was brutal, but I don't think it was gratuitous.  First, it showed the dangers that streetwalkers have to face.  Her pimp might have been a jerk, be he did at least in part seem to get her some good gigs with relatively civilized people (i.e., her opening scene).  As far as the rape situation goes, this was at a point in the movie where she was fast spiraling downhill.  After giving Ben more than enough leeway, he betrays her bigtime, and she throws him out.  She has just lost something she was very attached to, and this caused a huge depression that resulted in a very careless move.  The movie shows how she pays the price for this carelessness, and thus the downward spiral.  <br />I also don't think Elizabeth Shue's nude scene is gratuitous.  In fact, it's one of the most brilliant scenes ever shot that uses nudity.  To this point in the movie, they've been friends, but no banging, much to her dismay.  Liquor is much too important to him.  So when they are at a getaway resort, she sees that he even needs to take a bottle with him while swimming underwater at the pool.  She comes up with the brilliant idea that maybe if she becomes the booze herself, he will finally get the idea.  The idea works.  The fact that it also ends tragically is the the destiny of the story.<br />Based on what both lead actors have done before and since, this film will probably be considered the high-water mark of both of their careers. If it isn't, I'm looking forward to seeing what could be better.  It's a story that shows two incredibly lonely people meeting and interacting for a short time.  There is no way there could have been a happy ending.  They got what they put into life, and much of the time, you're lucky to get even that.
B000006TRV|3.0|.....and a unique brick is this too, seeing all the heaps and praises for this album. Again, like most other double albums the weakest points is just the lack of extremely good material to sustain the music all the way through. Another collection of some excellent and a whole plethora of songs basking in 'pretty goodness'. <br />Whats more when the division between the excellent and the 'pretty good' is so clearly laid out. Disc one is second to none and the second Disc is none to one. Sorry if that seems confusing, but if you have heard the album you already would know what i'm talking about. <br />Disc one really have brilliant songs which gives a good feeling of what Waters singing about. When The Thin Ice is played, i really do feel a sense of foreboding dangers and the images which Happiest Days of out Lives conjures up is so vivid. OooOOoo...and what about the excellent guitar on reverb, echoing through Another Brick in the Wall Part One. Dadadadadada. Yummy. Makes me feel like having another one, which they do dish out, two more in fact, each one getting more heavier than the previous. <br />This is where all the trouble starts, after one has been filled with such delights as on disc one, one gets treated to fart on the second disc! Bring the Boys Back Home ? Vera ? Waiting For The Worms ? Run Like Hell ? ALL FARCICAL!! ....waiting for the worms is the worst....especially the part where a whole choir of burly guys sings WEEITINGGG WEIITIING...ye[...] about Run Like Hell ?...face it...Pink Floyd can never Rock in the conventional sense and that is a good thing!<br />There are some gems to be found though, there's comfortably numb, the trial and hey you which are all really good and adds very well to the 'feel' of the album. Talking about feel, yeah, i think songs like Run Like Hell and Waiting For The Worms adds to the story line ( i assume that it is Pink Floyd's intention for 'Pink' to show that he is a dinosaur rock singer ). The songs are jsut not musically good enough. So too with Vera, when Waters' sings it feels like his been to the clubs in war time where Vera Lynn performed and he's now singing an ode to her. It's the melodies dude! thats what's lacking!<br />Of course, i only sought to highlight the less than good points in this review. This album is pretty good and I do think is better than Wish You Were Here but not as compelling as Animals!

B000063UR2|4.0|legend is about a young fairy boy that has to save the world from darkness.  This movie has the best scenery that I have ever seen in a movie.  The scenery alone makes this movie good.  Plus throw in a romanic storyline and you have one beautiful movie.
0784011710|5.0|Caught forever in an existential moment, Meryl Streep's portrayal of the aftereffects of Auschwitz is transfixing.  Sophie is the guilt-ridden survivor of a Nazi concentration camp, and Streep's remarkable work brings her leaping off the screen into the hearts and minds of the watcher.  This is a complex film which plays the outer tragedy of Sophie's present life against the inner tragedy of the evil she faced during the war.<br />As the story of Sophie's devastating past unfolds in flashbacks Streep faces choice after choice in her present life.  Each seems to eat away at her life.  Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline unite to give performances that that carefully balance Streep's, creating an intense overall effect that cannot be described easily,<br />The film's emotional and intellectual content make is a bit too lengthy and stagy, but the lulls set the stage for the emotional crises.  This is a heart rending story that will not be everyone's cup of tea, but Streep well deserves the Academy Award she got for this film, which was also nominated for best screenplay and best cinematography.
B000002JS6|5.0|Only one thing to say here.  This is the greatest album ever made.  I'm not sure why, but it just is.  There are albums with more variety, but as far as I'm concerned, they're just not as good.  AC/DC is the greatest band ever, and they've never made a bad album, not ever.  You just can't beat a band like this.  They take something simple, and make it great, and I think that's what it takes to make a great album.  This album here is awesome all the way through.  The title track is simply the best song ever.  Call me crazy, but I think Brian Johnson is better than any vocalist out there (ok, except for Geoff Tate from Queensryche), and Angus Young is without a doubt the greatest guitarist alive.  No way does he only know 3 chords!  I can only play 3 chords, and I'm not even this good!  Just buy the &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; DVD, and you'll see what a god he is.  If you like music, buy this.  There are no bad songs here, or on any AC/DC album.  They stick to a formula, and the formula works.  The only album that comes close to this is Slayer's &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;.
0671042858|5.0|I haven't read a Stephen King book in years.  I totally enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Since I'm writing this anonymously, I'll even admit I had a tear in my eye and the end (I'm a guy and that's not something we admit openly).
B00005RDCA|5.0|Equal parts slow-to-medium tempo folk-rock (not always all acoustic) and more up tempo, strident acid rock (5 songs each), plus one instrumental for solo acoustic guitar, 'Surrealistic Pillow' was a totally fresh, new sound early in 1967. Though not by any means all sweetness and light, the Airplane's new music and lyrics gave the whole country a chance to share something of the feeling of the Summer of Love which had transpired in San Francisco the year before. A new generation sprang out of the ground like millions of new flower species ready to display their newborn beauty to the world, and eventually to go to seed. The music of the time helped us all to grow up into what we felt was becoming a new age of humanity and the earth.<br />Lyrically the songs revolved around the singing of Marty Balin and Grace Slick, often [tracks 1, 3, 7 and 8] with Marty on lead and Grace singing counter-melodies and blending her gorgeous harmony voice with his to produce some of the best non-operatic duets ever heard.<br />On two very beautiful, very slow tunes, Marty solos on &quot;Today&quot;, and is re-joined by Grace on recorder for &quot;Comin' Back to Me&quot;. Grace herself belts out impassioned leads on the two singles from the album [&quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit&quot;].<br />&quot;D.C.B.A.-25&quot; is probably my favorite song on the album. &quot;I can but dance behind your smile.&quot;<br />&quot;How Do You Feel&quot; has an absolutely delicious acoustic guitar accompaniment, aided by more recorder played by Grace. &quot;Oh, how my heart beats! I don't even think I can talk . . .&quot;<br />This continues on the solo guitar piece &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot;.<br />For the closing number [&quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot;], Marty is solo vocalist, mouthing mile-a-minute Dylanesque lyrics to the acid sounds of the band.  &quot;You could see she has an individual style . . . she's a part of the carnival time.&quot; As the album fades off into secret regions of the listeners' brains, we all know we'll never be the same, or will we?<br />The guitarists and rhythm section are perfectly matched with their vocalist counterparts--everything here is inventive, tasteful, and plays throughout like forces of nature passionately at play. The recording engineer has mixed the parts together and dialed in just the right amount of reverb to capture the ambience perfectly. Everyone involved has done their jobs very, very well.<br />For me, all of the songs [and the album/CD as a whole] are five star phenomena.ret regions of the listeners' brains, we all know we'll never be the same, or will we? <br />The guitarists and rhythm section are perfectly matched with their vocalist counterparts--everything here is inventive, tasteful, and plays throughout like forces of nature passionately at play.

0792151712|1.0|Titanic has to be one of the worse films ever. There is no two ways about it. It is dreadful and I don't care how much money it pulled in at the box office or how many Oscars were showered on it. The plot is corny beyond belief. You will find stories of more sophistication and credibility in a Barbara Cartland novel. The portrayal of the Irish (below decks, of course) is patronising beyond belief. The special effects are not particularly special. (The computer generated Titanic looks like a badly drawn cartoon.) The acting is okay but everyone is miscast. DiCaprio, who looks as if he has come straight out of choir practice, does not convince as the Jack London figure he is obviously suppose to represent. Kate Winslet is not quite young enough to be the innocent abroad. However, they tackle their miscast roles with greater skill and artistry than James Cameron tackles his. <br />I sat through three hours of this monstrous tripe wishing like mad that a U-Boat would come along and sink this turkey. Now that would have been a revisionist plot twist that could have saved this movie. Where is the German navy when you want them?
B00005T30L|5.0|I originally watched Ghost World on a whim because of its excellent reviews.  I assumed a light hearted above average \\"teen movie\\".  What I got instead was a movie of intelligence, witticism and ultimately, deep humanity.<br />Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi are excellent as the main characters who live their lives as nonconformist outcasts in a world with little leeway for them.  Their nonconformity isn't the hip variety, it's more a personal inability to accept (or adapt) to the social structure around them.  This is a movie for anyone who has felt themselves an outcast at one time or other.<br />From her disfunctional home life to her interactions with he best friend, Thora Birch is excellent as the  main character.  Her intelligence, alienation and attempt at cynicism at the world around her is well done.  She's finally undone by her own sensitivity and confusion at the end.<br />Buscemi plays an outcast in his late 30's who's special affinity is for old records.  He plays it as if he were born to this role.  We all, I think, know someone like this or have aspects of his personality in our own lives.<br />Terry Zwigoff's direction is excellent.  There is no hollywood ending to make you leave with a smile.  It's an ambiguous future that Thora goes off into at the end.<br />Highly recommended.
B00003CXXP|3.0|Artificial Intelligence is an interesting journey of a boy named David(Haley Joel Osment) as he tries so hard to be a real boy. And it's a film of journey as we watch him try to get back to his mom. <br />David is a product of Dr. Hobby(William Heard) who decides that they must create a robot that can love. They have shown that they can create robots who can feel pain, but none have had the ability to love anyone. And one of the interesting questions is asked in the movie by one of the students he is talking to, &quot;What if the human doesn't love the robot back?&quot; Which is the problem that Dr. Hobby doesn't really touch upon. Monica is given David(the prototype) from her husband, since their son is terminally sick. Monica at first is not to happy with this gift, and fears it. After time though she starts to play with it and talk with it. She finally decides to program it to love. David then bonds to his mom. But then her son gets better. After he comes home the son makes David do bad things, and David messes up a couple of times. They then separate David from his family. And this is where the journey starts as David just wants to find the Blue Fairy to become a real boy so his mom will love him. The Blue Fairy is from Pinnochio and he thinks she is real. This journey is the best part of the movie though at times a little long at times. The movie is great and it has a lot of Pinnochio elements to it. And Spielberg does a good job of making Kubrick's vision live.<br />The DVD contains many featurettes, some trailers, and behind the scences looks. Get a copy today.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This is the only movie where I actually got up in the middle of the movie and walked out of the theatre in horror and disgust. This film is a tasteless hodge podge of phony glitz that goes no deeper than the set and costumes and &quot;cut and paste&quot; music, which was absolutely revolting.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Monsters, Inc. is a great movie, and it seems Pixar can do no wrong. They continue their dominance of making good movies and high grossing movies. Unlike their parent company Disney who has faltered lately.<br />Monsters is a great story and concept. Monsters who live in another world that have to scare children to power their city. What a great concept. Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) is the top scarer and the guy who never ceases to train. Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) who is assistant and can't seem to keep up with the office work, but has a great knack for making jokes and training Sulley. Sulley though creates a problem as he sneaks into a door one day, and accidentally brings a child out. That child name is Boo. And Boo is the heartstring to this movie. She is scared of Randall who has an evil plot to get screams out of Boo. Sulley discovers that plot and reveals it. Monsters is a great movie that explores great themes as well: friendship, laughter, and fear is easy to overcome. The animation is grand scale, and the laughs are always there. The emotional aspect is a great turn for Pixar and shows that these guys have heart as well as the old funny bone. Get this when it comes out. You won't be disappointed.

0783225733|3.0|Apollo 13 is a very good film and worthy of 3.5 stars, but there is no 3.5 stars on this rating device. The DVD release does deserve a 5 star. The movie still is a 3.5 movie though.<br />Apollo 13 follows the life of Jim Lovell and his crewmates as they prepare for the disaster mission, and it's very moving at times. It has great special effects. (Like when the Saturn V rocket launches off) It has great acting from every angle: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kevin Bacon. I especially think Ed Harris acting here is grand. It speaks volumes. Tom Hanks is good here, but his acting is better in Forrest Gump, Philadelphia and Saving Private Ryan. This is still good work. The writing is superb and the directing is very well. I especially like how much suspense is built on the radio silence moment. You know what's going to happen, but for a moment you can feel the emotions running in all the characters and get caught up in the &quot;are they going to make it&quot; mentality. That's how good this movie is at times. A good movie that almost stands as a great movie. <br />Along with the movie the DVD offers many special features that are worthy of checking out and looking into. Along with audio commentary is a documentary and a full version of the orginal soundtrack. Buy the DVD today.

I think it is called \\"Easy Money\\" or \\"Life isnt Easy\\", Im not sure. I would like to know the title and where I can find it because I cant find it not even on this album.

B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream Theater did an excellent job at following up, &quot;Scenes from a Memory Part: 2&quot;  This double CD album has two completely different faces.  The first CD is more of DT's famous art metal combined with a little synthesized voice.  Non-synthesized voice is much better but it does not detract from the CD.  James LaBrie, John Petrucci, and and Mikey Portnoy bring an 80's Metallica sound to the first CD.  Their second CD is a wonderful keyboard orchestra.
B000002UUX|5.0|This is the best album, top to bottom, that Megadeth has ever put out.  This is their climax.<br />From the mind-numbing assault of 'Holy Wars...' to the blistering solos in 'Hangar 18', to the freaking insane riffs on 'Take No Prisoners' to the atmospheric build/trainwreck of 'Five Magics' - this disc has it all.  <br />And that's just side 1.<br />This is one of the most complete pieces of metal created.  And it still stands up despite its age. There is no heavy repeat on a chorus and the lyrics wind their way through ever-changing riffs. It's a metal tapestry.<br />Yes, it's a classic.  Regrettably, it's the last such brilliance to be put out by the boys from Megadeth.

And it shows.  <br />While this disc has some OK tracks (Liar, Anarchy in the UK) there are some strong classics: My Darkest Hour (written after Cliff Burton's death), Mary Jane, Set the World Afire.<br />The production on this disc really captures the frantic world of Megadeth at this stage in their careers.  I know this CD is not for everyone, but I truly believe it's not to be missed.
0060977493|5.0|Don't let this book's packaging fool you: it is poetry. It is just over 300 pages of poetry, meant to be read aloud, set down, thought about, slept on, read aloud some more, and thought about some more. And when you're done reading it, you should set it down, think about it, and reread it.<br /><br />No one part of The God Of Small Things can be understood without understanding the rest of it, but perhaps a chunk from the beginning of the book will reveal some of its beauty and form. Read it aloud if you'd like; that's probably the best way to appreciate it. The quote is this:<br /><br />\\"Their lives have a size and a shape now. Estha has his and Rahel hers.  Edges, Borders, Boundaries, Brinks and Limits have appeared like a team of trolls on their separate horizons. Short creatures with long shadows, patrolling the Blurry End. Gentle half-moons have gathered under their eyes and they are as old as Ammu was when she died. Thirty-one.<br /> Not old.<br /> Not young.<br /> But a viable die-able age.\\"<br /><br />That quote is particularly apt, revealing as it does the poetic tragedy of the book. There is very little that is uplifting about The God Of Small Things, because nearly every image is surrounded by the knowledge -- which Ms. Roy plainly lays out early on -- that tragedy will befall the characters soon. As readers, we approach the tragedy with mounting horror, followed by something like resignation, followed by deep loss.<br /><br />The tragedies of this book are the tragedies of caste, of childhood lost, and of love destroyed. Outwardly, the book is the story of two twins and the broken lives that their childhoods yielded. To me, it is much more: it is a series of paintings in words, of a million small feelings and events from everyday life: the feeling of a lover's skin on our own, the thoughts that race through a child's mind, the desperation of adults who are trying so hard to hold onto the tattered remnants of their youth.<br /><br />The story is told in such a way that each painting appears for a moment, then disappears into a misty background. This, anyway, is how I envisioned it. Ms. Roy paints each Small Thing well enough that we can see it for ourselves, marvel at its beauty and truth, then move onto the next. It is some of the most sublime prose I have ever read.<br /><br />I know nothing about India, but the books I've read by Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy reveal it to be a land of almost bottomless sadness. It is a testament to their skill as writers that an ignorant man like me can see -- and more importantly, feel -- their heartache.hen disappears into a misty background.

B00000ILDE|4.0|Aliens takes place 57 years after the original Alien. Ripley is in her escape ship sleeping when a deep space salvage crew finds her. They send her to a small space station where she is revived and has continuous nightmares about aliens. After having her flight license revoked at a meeting about the aliens with Weyland Yutani,(they obviously didn't believe her) she agrees to go with a group of marines to rescue colonists after they stop responding to messages on the planet LV- 426, which is the same planet she was on with the rest of her crew in Alien. Things have changed; people are living there and terraforming the planet to make it breathable. Anyway, once Ripley and the marines get there, they discover the aftermath of a blody fight between the aliens and the colonists. But soon enough, the aliens start coming and a small battle pursues. After the battle, only Ripley, an android named Bishop, Newt, (a little girl Ripley found) and a few marines are left. Now, Ripely must lead them against the aliens and get the heck off the planet.<br />Skillfully directed by James Cameron, this movie never lets up. The last hour of this movie is all hard-hitting action. There are many highlights in this film, including when Ripley arms herself to the teeth to go rescue Newt. After watching this movie, you'll ask yourself, &quot;Where else can I see marines ahooting away at aliens while spewing out more expletives than Ving Rhames in &quot;Pulp Fiction?&quot; Also, the ending is great and the aliens (especially the queen) look great. The only aliens that look better in all four films are the ones in Alien Resurrection.<br />There are some falws though. Most notably, it takes about 90 minutes for the action to start up. Sure, it's pretty boring for the first half of the movie, but it pays off in the end. Another flaw is the unoriginal ending. The ending is just basically a beefed-up version of the original's ending. (But it is still pretty cool.) The last set of flaws are just some errors. In the oringinal, LV-426 was brown with rings around it. In this movie, it doesn't have rings around it and it's blue. Maybe because of the terraforming...    Also, colonists have been on that planet for 57 YEARS and they hadn't found the alien ship? C'mon. <br />Aside from that, this movie is definetly worth watching. Not better than the first, but better than the rest of the quadrilogy. Highly recommended. A sci-fi/action fan's dream.
B000062Y98|4.0|The latest CD from German power metal meisters Blind Guardian reaches for the stars with a production sound so big I'm surprised they could squeeze it all onto one CD.<br />How big? Think Texas. Think the vastness of space. Think Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" The question, however, is: Do they actually reach the stars?<br />Well, almost. They came darn close.<br />And for the attempt alone I have to award Blind Guardian four stars. They dared to reach for a height very few bands attempt (or have the talent) to attain. What prevents Blind Guardian from becoming the supergroup that Queen were are three things: (1) Singer Hansi Kursch, whose voice is an acquired taste. Unlike Freddie Mercury, Hansi's voice isn't always sweet, emotive, and radio-friendly. Hansi's voice takes a while to get used to. But that's a good thing. He's unique and original. And I've acquired the taste for his style.  (2) They don't have Queen's songwriting sensibilities. They have Queen's vast multi-layered sound, but BG doesn't write in Queen's semi-pop, radio-friendly way; and (3) BG's music takes repeated listenings to fully appreciate, so if you're looking for a quick fix, or you're impatient by nature, BG won't fit the bill. <br />All of this is not to say BG isn't interesting. Oh, no. They have a unique sound that you either love or hate. And they're a powerhouse in concert. Hansi's wide-ranging, sometimes piercing voice, the ear-filling sound of stacked vocals and clever guitars, and today's in-your-face metal production can be the recipe for a headache...or it can be something you listen to and say, \\"Wow.\\"<br />I'm closer to the latter than I am the former, although I must admit Blind Guardian's production is so dense on A Night at the Opera -- named as an homage to Queen, I'm sure -- that it's almost fuzzy to my ears.<br />There's really no way I can pick out a favorite track on this CD. They all pretty much sound the same, which is to say they're all very good. You have to give high marks to a band that releases a 14-minute single called \\"And Then There Was Silence\\" a few months ahead of the album from which it was culled. The buzz created by that one single made BG's A Night at the Opera one of the most anticipated releases of 2002. And the wait was well worth it.<br />I don't know how to recommend Blind Guardian, other than to say it's an acquired taste that requires a definite love of Queen -- and heavy metal -- to appreciate. I think this band is fascinating and unique. And those two qualities, alone, make them worthy of my respect.
B000002OOY|5.0|If you love the movie, you'll enjoy this soundtrack. It has ALL the excitement and wonder, straight from the Jurassic Park film. John Williams has talent for story telling with music, and this remarkable collection shows his expertise in composing. All sixteen tracks are a complete roller coaster ride of emotion. Sometimes when I listen to track number 7, Welcome to Jurassic Park, the piano solo will make me teary eyed, or I'll get goose bumps when the the whole orchestra comes alive with the JP theme. Other memorable tracks that have the same effect are Journey To The Island, Dennis Steals The Embryo, High-Wire Stunts and the T-Rex Rescue & Finale. Beyond a doubt, this CD is worth spending money on.
0748662529|5.0|Set in rural Botswana, Alexander McCall Smith's novel adds a twist to the conventional detective mystery.  The striking feature in Smith's story is not a captivating crime with clues that keep the reader guessing.  Rather, the life of detective heroine Mma. Ramotswe governs the novel's focus.  Readers will more often find themselves chuckling at Mma. Ramostwe's dry humor than piecing together a compelling mystery.  Described as a heavy-set, middle-aged woman, Mma. Ramotswe relates to characters and readers at a basic, human level.  For instance, after a frustrating day at work, the novel tells how she returns to the comfort of her home and routine pumpkin dinner, something that \\"brought you down to earth ... [and] gave you reason for going on\\" (81).  Furthermore, Mma. Ramostwe often serves as a counselor to her clients.  In several instances Smith likens her position to a priest or doctor and calls her a \\"fixer of lives.\\"  Mma. Ramostwe discovers techniques in professional detective manuals prove less effective than her intuition and listening skills.  Smith does an excellent job developing Mma. Ramotswe's character outside of her detective work sphere.  The first several chapters are devoted to telling about Mma. Ramotswe's father and her family.  To a reader eager to dive into hunting clues, this background detail can seem laborious and tedious; however, learning about her family history is essential in seeing Mma. Ramotswe as more than a one-dimensional Sherlock Holmes detective.  Knowing about parts of Mma. Ramostwe's personal life, such as her deceased father and failed marriage, enables readers to understand the motives behind Mma. Ramostwe's detective agency and her attitude toward gender and domestic issues.  Mma. Ramostwe never attempts to unearth a mass murderer or serial killer; instead, she works mainly on domestic cases involving cheating husbands and disobedient daughters.  Readers may be frustrated that no common thread seems to tie Mma. Ramostwe's seemingly unrelated cases together.  However, the lackluster and somewhat random nature of her cases enhances Mma. Ramostwe's character and parallels a realistic detective agency, in which investigators aren't constantly putting their life on the line to unearth a sensational crime.  Mma. Ramostwe struggles with issues common to many independent agencies, such as making ends meet and cooperating with her secretary and various clients.  Placing Mma. Ramostwe as the central feature of his novel allows Smith to reveal a humanistic side to detection that sensational murder mysteries and traditional Sherlock Holmes novels lack.
B000056K04|5.0|I am not one of the DMB-philes (see, I don't even know what they are called), and I don't get the whole &quot;it's not acoustic/not traditional DMB enough&quot; stuff.  I just think that this is another fabulous CD by an incredibly talented band. Why can't a great band try a different style?? I don't rate band's CDs based on their other CDs, so you won't get that here.  All I can say is, I love music, and I love this CD.  If you like intelligent lyrics and beautiful melodies, this is a CD for you.
B000059ZLH|5.0|If you are a fan of music played with intensity and mastery, this is the DVD for you.  It really doesn't matter how die-hard a fan you are of Dream Theater, this DVD should please anyone who is a fan of fine musicianship.  If you are a DT fan, then get ready to experience a serious musical ride.<br />As you will read in other reviews, portions of the concert are over-theatrical, but the positive side of this is it gives you good feeling of what a Dream Theater concert is really like.  Everyone in the band puts on a stellar performance, as you have come to expect, so it is really difficult to list specific \\"highlights\\".  If you want to see two masters of the six-string universe, I have three words for you: Petrucci  and Myung.  Also, this DVD includes one of the greatest displays of drum pyrotechnics that you will ever see.  Check out Mike Portnoy on \\"Finally Free\\" - simply amazing.  Just buy this DVD, you will not be sorry...
B000002JNJ|5.0|Great. This is the first CD in nine years that the Texas boys have released. I don't like considering their 80's glam-metal demos actual music. This IS their debut, and what a debut it is...<br />Cowboys From Hell hinted towards a new era of hard rock/metal. This CD matches any Metallica CD in any possible way. The follow-up, Vulgar Display Of Power would usurp them all. This one is unique from the other Pantera discs in that it isn't 100% crushing yet. Phil Anselmo really showcases his vocal talent here, folks. He sings, squeals, grunts, croons, and screams like no one's business, making him sound like a cross of Rob Halford, Axl Rose, and even Robert Plant. Some songs, like &quot;Cemetery Gates,&quot; begin softly and build and build till the ending. Others like &quot;Shattered,&quot; and the title track are all about Phil. Diamond Darell's guitar slides and skills are existent here, and Rex and Vinnie are beginning to hint at how incredible a rhythm section they are. Get this and make it a part of your collection.
B00005RIKI|4.0|I bought this just to hear Freebird cause I wasn't sure if I'd ever heard it before but had heard lots about it! I listened to the other tracks (only having heard Sweet Home Alabama before) and was pleasantly surprised - the music wasn't the sound I expected! Really enjoyable, and I picked it up relatively cheaply - great impulse buy and it looks good in my collection!
B000009CEM|4.0|This album is great. You have your classic Fear Factory(&quot;Shock&quot;, &quot;Smasher/Devourer&quot;), some rap-metal(&quot;Edgecrusher&quot;), radio stuff(&quot;Descent&quot;), and a masterpiece(&quot;Resurrection&quot;). However, Fear Factory's Obsolete just lacks something that Demanufacture had. It could be the speed. It could be the use of synths. It could be the double bass drumming. That's okay, though. Unfortunately, Obsolete can't match its follow-up, either. Digimortal, their 'sellout' album, has unbelievable double bass, melodic singing, and an interesting flirtation with hip-hop. Although the guitar and bass riffs are very simple and the lyrics and rapping childish, it's still beter than Obsolete. Obsolete just is missing SOMETHING between those two extremes. All in all, great album, and the concept story behind it is hauntingly mesmerizing. It just misses where Demanufacture and Digimortal don't.
B00005YU1O|5.0|The movie was absolutley fantastic.  It proves that film making is still an art form.  A none stop tour de force of philosophical ideas and overall great dialog.  The visuals are also stunning.
B000001A5X|5.0|Recently VH-1 screened the viewers top 100 albums of all-time, which started me thinking what would be at the top of my list. I came up with this one.<BR>Marvin produced many soul classics during his lifetime, but none that matched the perceptiveness or depth of this album. <BR> Musical genius, troubled man, deep thinker, husband, father, this amazing work of art sends out a message that is not only political but profoundly personal in showing his many sides.<BR> Here is a man who was decades ahead of his time personally and professionally, 'Marvin Knew'.<BR> If you ever get the chance to experience the pure genius of 'What's goin on' DO IT!.<BR> I promise you won't regret it.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I never got into No Doubt.  I would hear a new song of theirs on the radio and like it, but I have never owned a No Doubt CD.  I took my little sister to the No Doubt concert in Seattle and was blown away!!  I loved the variety of music styles, and Gwen sure knows how to put on a show!  Definitely one of the best performances I've ever seen!  This CD rocks!!
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Let me start out by saying that this DVD is worth buying just for the plethora of extras: the behind-the-scenes sequences, the director commentaries, storyboard pitches, games, outtakes, and so much more. It's hours and hours of entertainment in itself.<br />As far as the movie goes, I generally enjoy this film. Eddie Murphy is fantastic as Donkey, showing off once again his ability to successfully bring oddball characters to life. Although people have complained about the &quot;one-liner&quot; feel about the movie, Donkey never ceases to make me laugh, no matter how many times I've watched the movie. John Lithgow is terrific as well, perfectly devious as Lord Farquad. My one (very big) complaint is Cameron Diaz's performance as Princess Fiona - during the entire movie, she sounds like she's reading monotonous text, and at the same time trying a little too hard to be excited. Her interpretation of her character comes off like someone in a bad high school play, and the dialog could have been written better for her part. Most of all, I'll never know why she specifically was chosen to be the voice of Fiona, as Diaz's voice really has no special &quot;quality&quot; about it. Where Murphy, Lithgow, and Mike Myers bring life to their characters, Diaz falls flat.
0345350499|5.0|Every woman should have a copy of this book in her library.  It not only gives a new view to the Arthur Legend but lets the reader see a time when women were not just chattel for men. When women stood tall in their own skin and owned their own bodies. I think this is important in a world that has said that women do not even own the name on their birth certificates. I would recommend this book for any girl over 13 or 14 too. If I had a daughter this would have been a gift for her.I think it would build the self esteem of any teen girl.
B000062X90|5.0|I'm not one to give many albums 5 stars, but ARGUS definitely qualifies as one of the best classic rock records ever.  I've been checking the Wishbone Ash section of record stores for years, hoping MCA would do something special with this disc (the original CD issue was okay, but sound quality wasn't the best), and now that day has finally come.  My only complaint is that you still can't see the flying saucer in the artwork.  Other than that, THANK YOU MCA/DECCA/UNIVERSAL--whatever your name is this week--for a proper CD release.
B00005RJ1U|4.0|It's about time a horror movie interested me enough to where I went to see it in the theater. Jeepers Creepers is a non-stop horrifying thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's a creepy, eerie film that will give you chills up and down your spine. It was also the first time in a long time a DEMON was the killer. I enjoy movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer but to me a \\"True\\" horror movie must have some supernatural demon from hell spilling the blood. Speaking of blood, if you like horror movies but have to turn away from the violent, disturbing scenes this movie is perfect for you. After I saw this movie I couldn't help but think something was missing... you guessed it, the blood. Not showing many of the violent scenes only adds to the mystery and mystique of this film. It lets you use your imagination. If your a fan of the \\"True\\" horror movies like I am check out Jeepers Creepers.
B000002J2B|3.0|&quot;AFTERGLOW&quot; is an absolutely gorgeous love song. It has some<br />very romantic and poetic lyrics from TONY BANKS and PHIL COLLINS<br />sings his heart out on it. The arrangement for this song is per-<br />fect; it's one of their best love songs ever. As for the rest<br />of this, well.. I personally think they've done much better.WIND<br />is very much in the prog rock mode of earlier GENESIS albums, but<br />this album is seriously marred by TONY BANKS' wall to wall key-<br />boards and synthesizers, which practically smother all the other<br />instruments. Also, most of the songs aren't really that inter-<br />esting, tho' some of them have their moments. My two favorite<br />tracks besides AFTERGLOW are THE UNQUIET SLUMBERS,etc...IN THAT<br />QUIET EARTH, which starts out very dreamy and soothing, then<br />rocks out a bit; and ONE FOR THE VINE, which is quite beautiful<br />in parts. The lyrics, for the most part, are typical for GENESIS<br />and the performances are more than competent, but this album<br />just doesn't grab me like some of the other GENESIS albums. I<br />think the SPOT THE PIGEON EP has a much better production and far<br />better songs. AFTERGLOW, however, is worth buying the album for!
6300262855|5.0|What can I say about re-animator? It's a clever yet terrifying film with frightening scenes and very disturbing images. It's H.P. Lovecraft at his best. Combines the Horror and creepiness of Night of the Living Dead with the gore and comedy of Evil Dead. Jeffery Combs(From Beyond, another Lovecraft masterpiece) plays a college student who invents a serum to revive the dead. he gets more than he bargains for when these corpses are revived. You'll have to see what I mean by checking out this one yourself. Any horror fan will be pleased with this film.
6302517036|5.0|I loved watching this movie.  Roddy McDowell was excellent in this fim as Peter Vincent, \\"Fearless Vampire Killer\\".  Yeah, right.  If this is what made him so famous on screen, why was he living in a small, cramped, and cluttered one bedroom apartment with a job hosting horror flicks on a show that scraped the bottom of the barrel in ratings??<br />  As for Chris Sarandon, this is the best I've seen him look in a long time, especially in his vampire make-up.  What's so attractive is that he is so suave when he seduces Evil Ed into taking his hand.  The way he kidnapped Amy was classic too.  Dandridge's 'attraction' to Amy was almost otherworldly, if a somewhat typical throwback to the B-Movies of the 1950's.<br /><br />I especially liked when Charlie, the typically sex-starved teenager, gets curious and discovers his neighbor, Jerry Dandridge's secret.  It's really funny when he tries to convince the policeman of a murder.  Even Amy thought he was cracked.<br /><br />Yes, the plot holes were there as far as the script, but at least no one was dumb enough to stand in the path of the vampire screaming. This is what gave the movie strength, despite the troubles with plot.  Peter Vincent did stammer and cower after he visited Charlie's neighbor.  It's amazing how he rebounds though.<br />I've seen the second installment of this movie and prefer this one to that one.
6304675348|4.0|Director Wes Craven(Nightmare on Elm St.) has done it again. Another horror movie that you'll never forget. I didn't see Scream at when it first came out because I honestly didn't think it would be worth the $8.00 to see in a movie theater. A friend of mine rented this movie and told me it was worth seeing. It certainly was. It stars big named actors/actresses such as Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Jaime Kennedy and Courtney Cox. Scream has a typical horror movie plot with plenty of blood and butcherings, however, it also has a mystery throughout the movie on who the real killer is. Also, throughout the movie, they make plenty of references back to some of the classic horror movies such Halloween and Psycho. Scream was big enough to spawn two sequels and I believe is the reason movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend were created. If your a fan of suspensful horror films don't miss this one. Scream is definately worth the price of admission.
6304143184|4.0|....I was about 3 when the original came out and it has been one of the movies I will NEVER forget!!...Now that it is back, I am thrilled...I have to say that it saddens me that movie producers feel the urge to change this movie to make it \\"politically correct.\\"  Maybe the guns are bad for kids to see, but they see it in every action movie their parents let them watch EVERY DAY!!  I agree...that...the movie should be left alone.  And please, make the original available (and affordable) AT LEAST to the people who would like to see the REAL thing.
0871137380|5.0|This is an exceptional book on the true picture of modern combat.  It is worth reading before seeing the movie since the movie does not get too far into character development.  The movie does follow the same course as the book.  A must read for those interested in military history and selfless bravery.
6304143184|4.0|For all you people who have been dissing E.T. all together, I would like to tell you what you can do with your opinions....But I digress.  I was about 3 when the original came out and it has been one of the movies I will NEVER forget!!  I even remember begging my mother to buy me the E.T. cereal.  Now that it is back, I am thrilled.  I have two younger siblings that are 10 and 12 years younger than myself.  I am so happy that they will have the opportunity to experience this movie.  But, I have to say that it saddens me that movie producers feel the urge to change this movie to make it \\"politically correct.\\"  Maybe the guns are bad for kids to see, but they see it in every action movie their parents let them watch EVERY DAY!!  I agree with previous ratings that say the movie should be left alone.  And please, make the original available (and affordable) AT LEAST to the people who would like to see the REAL thing.
0440211727|4.0|A time To Kill by John Grisham was one of the best books I have ever read.  This book portrayed the love and loyalty of a father to his daughter.  It showed the realism of racism and how far things can go.  This wasn't an average book about the courts had how people take justice into their own hands.  It was all black and white. There was almost no gray in this town divided.  The hard fighting white lawyer does all he can to get a fair trial for a black man while fighting off the KKK and putting his family at risk.
B00003CX8J|5.0|This film really shows the appeal of the X-MEN property, I have watched it many times. It actually had heart, unlike others like 'The Phantom Menace', and didn't feel fake or overdone. Unknown actor Hugh Jackman shows tremendous talent as Wolverine...his appeal is in his lack of a backstory, there can't really be a star to the X-team, but Xavier is the anchor. The cast is great, McKellen and Stewart are a nice match and dialogue can be thoughtful. The DVD is great, containing everything you might want connected to the film...
B00003CXPD|4.0|In the Coal-Mining Community in 1984 of Northern England in a Small Town. When a 11 year old boy named Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) becomes interested in Dancing and he embarrasses his gruff father (Gary Lewis) and his older Brother (Jamie Draven) by abandoning Boxing Lessons for...Ballet.<br />Directed by Stephen Daldry and Written by Lee Rich brings a well made Dramatic Comedy in this Coming of Age film. Which the movie`s only Flaw is Quite Slow Moving at times. Jamie Bell brings a Expectional Performance in this and also Julie Walters shines as Billy`s Chain Smoking Mentor. DVD`s has an clean anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. This is a Clever, Often Touching film. Grade:A-.
B000002KBU|5.0|This is a most amazing album by one of the best female vocalists of all time.  I havn't got bored of it yet which is an amazing thing for me.  What ever mood your in it takes you away. It relaxes you and stimulates you in the perfect balance. I promise you will never regreat buying this.  Best tracks include the first track (All I Want) and track 8 (River).  Although I must say this is one of the only albums where I don't skip a track, another amazing thing for me.  <BR>BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT and get sung to by an ANGEL.

An woman killed accidently a Man on the Road, comes back to life as a Undead lowlife makes her life a living hell though the Night.<br />Directed by Micheal Gornick (Who is Cinemagrapher for George A.

Still, this film was a Hit for New World Pictures. But the Magic of the First, Including the Look and Style is Gone. Tom Savini has a small role as the Creep. Stephen King has a Cameo. Although horror fans will take a look. It`s not bad but it should have been better. Grade:B-.
B00003CXUM|4.0|Wong Kar-wai's &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; is like a tone<BR>poem, subtle yet affecting, about love and longing and the <BR>barriers to true connection. The plot is gossamer-thin, but<BR>the film is held together by beautiful performances from Tony<BR>Leung and the sumptuous Maggie Cheung. The production design,<BR>from Ms. Cheung's dresses to the rich cinematography, is simply divine.
B00005JKYS|5.0|In 1965 President Johnson decided to pour men into Viet Nam. This is the TRUE story of the new tactics of \\"The Helicopter Soldiers.\\" This is a powerful movie, you will NOT leave with dry eyes, for this movie shows in detail what a god awful waste <BR>Viet Nam truly was. It also shows how brave men rally when called upon by their country. The men depicted here were and ARE TRUE AMERICAN HEROES! While you watch this film please remember, this is true and also remember that the powers that be sent these men into harms way on purpose, as a test!<BR>You WILL be glad you saw it. This movie shows the true brutality of war. Gone are the days of the old war movie where a shot soldier clutches his chest and falls over nice and clean. If you are squeamish you may want to pass on this movie. War IS hell, and this movie pulls no punches, and tells it like it is. <BR>It shows in detail what happens to the human body struck by napalm and riddled by machine gun fire. <BR>I was supposed to write a review of \\"We were soldiers\\" the night I saw it, I could not. I had to wait till the next day and still I wept at my key board. What \\"Saving Pvt.

0684867621|3.0|This is definately worth the read, but in my opinion it wasn't as good as I thought it would be, nor as good as everyone told me it was.<br />Girl gets lost in the woods, after a few days she starts having dellusions, thinks \\"something\\" (don't want to give too much away) is following her, sees Tom Gordon (pro ball player) who helps her find her way.<br />It's a fairly short book so you can probably finish it in a few nights.
0887306101|5.0|I have started work on the trading floors for a large bank in London, and I read this book before I began. It is such a great book. Very easy and fun to read. And truly motivating. The conclusion one draws is that there are many ways to win at trading. There is no one secret system apart from correct money management. My only criticism is that the interviewees were a bit (understandably) vague concerning their trading strategys. So if you do (&amp; I know you will) buy this book, do not expect to learn specific ways to trade. Instead, enjoy reading about the gods of trading!
0684843749|5.0|Every time I have a question about my routine or diet this is the first source I look to.  It comes before the web, calling a friend, or asking someone at the gym.<br />Just the other day I was training and I looked in the mirror and decided &quot;I really need to work on outer calf development.&quot;  When I got home I grabbed this book and looked it up.  &quot;If outer calves are a weak point do this, that, this,&quot; etc.  If I need tips on posing, preparing for photo shoots, information on bulking up, information on cutting up, and just about anything else it's this book that I look to for a reference.<br />If you are a hardcore bodybuilder or just someone who wants to learn more (from basic stuff to advanced techniques about competition even), I HIGHLY recommend this book.
6305181810|3.0|While the Rainmaker is a very decent adaptation of pulp writer John Grisham's novel, Coppola has slyly inserted one of the most subtlely powerful sequences of his career.  Watch closely the scene in which Matt Damon places Claire Danes in the hospital bed after he's rescued her from the abusive husband.  Look at the shots...  Close up of his hands touching her elbows, Close up of his hands grasping her hips/back...All close ups of the intimate touch.  It's such a small moment in the story, yet Coppola understands that it is the defining moment in this young romance.  A beautiful sequence of shots by one of the masters.  Take a second look.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I only had money to see it 6 times in the theater. It`s a great, exuberant,<BR>brilliant masterpiece. Lynch had fun making this movie, I`m sure!
B00003CXB7|5.0|As a long time MASH fan I found this DVD a must have.  Besides the movie being one of Hollywood's best I found that the extra footage and specials on the two-disc set were a great added value.  My girlfriend who's grandfather owned the choppers in the movie and TV show got a good taste of what the film was about from one of the documentary's on the DVD.  She did not want to see the entire film but she said that from what we showed her she got a good taste of the film.  To me this is a great american film that shows our feelings and thoughts during the 60's and 70's.
0446677450|5.0|I heard about this book from a friend, I didn't rush out to buy it but I should have. I had no desire what so ever for investing. This book opened my eyes, in the 3 months since finishing \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad,\\" I have read 5 more books on investing and purchased a total of 9 more. Soon after finishing the book, I started watching real estate sales and paying more attention to stocks and bonds. When starting the book, I had nothing invested and less then a few hundred saved. Remembering I've only had 3 months since the book reading, I now have $500 in stocks and bonds and have made an unspeakable ammount from real estate purchase and reselling. I had absolutely no motivation for money or investing until I read this book, now it's made me rich.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is one beautiful film I had waited for for months to see after seeing Russell Crowe last year while on his US tour with his band. It lives up to its hype from beginning to end. Russell Crowe mastrfully takes the viewer on a journey to hell and back. A  FILM  NOT TO BE MISSED!!!
B00005JKYS|5.0|This was the best movie about the Viet Nam experience that I've ever seen. You should read the book and get more detail of how truly horrible this 3 days of battle truly was. As a VN vet an artilleryman of the \\"FIRST CAV\\", I am truly proud of these men who fought and of those who lost their lives. It helps me to understand what it was like in the field while I had the relative security of a fire base or LZ. 1st Cav for ever.
0312958455|4.0|Have just finished this one and it's a great read!!  With a few twists and turns to keep the reader guessing and an intricate plot, this was hard to put down!!  Thought it was getting a bit long-winded towards the end but nevertheless very captivating with a twist I didn't expect!!
6304490119|1.0|Don't buy this DVD. Don't get me wrong this is a wonderful movie, but the DVD is terrible. The DVD is single layered which means half way through a longer movie, like this one, you have the distinct pleasure of flipping the disc over to enjoy the other half of the film. All is not lost though; there was another edition, a special edition, released shortly after this one that you don't have to flip over. Not only that but it contains a few more special features and instead of this edition's 119min. run time, it runs for 128min. The special edition is for sale here on Amazon.com and actually cost a few dollars less!
B000007UA4|4.0|I bought this album in Australia many years back when it was released and I always felt it was an album that deserved the same attention 'Fever' is now receiving. My Sister eventually pinched the album off of me while I was travelling and I have missed it ever since. She likes it too much to give it back. <BR>It still has all the disco hooks that she is well received for, but it is a much more understated sound - perfect for that long trip in the car. The strongest tracks I thought were \\"Right Here, Right Now\\" and \\"Live and Learn\\". Neither tracks were ever released as singles as far as I know, which is something I have noticed with many of her releases. I think that many of her great tracks are never released as singles, perhaps defining the save the best until the end ethos. <BR>Over all it is a sexy, catchy album and like so much of her music, has not faded with the years. This is definitely one of Kylies hidden gems, and I remember it left me feeling like I wanted more by the time the last track ends.<BR>So playing it once is just not enough, it will seduce you unexpectedly, and i can't wait for my new copy to arrive to listen to again. This album never got the credit it deserved.
B00001MXXG|5.0|No child of the 80s can call themselves complete with owning this DVD. Suprisingly enough the DVD is of top notch quality, although a little lacking in the special feature department. Let me just clarify that the only special feature the DVD contains is just a commentary. Otherwise the DVD is perfect, a nice keep case, no snap cases here folks. Furthermore the movie is displayed in widescreen and you will here it in beautiful Dolby Digital 5.1. Packed full of humor and fun moments this is a must have for any DVD collector.

0060922583|5.0|\\"I am sure you have gone astray if you are moved to homesickness for anything in this dimension.  We transform these things; they are not real, they are only the reflection upon the polished surface of our being.\\"  ~~ Ranier M. Rilke, from \\"Requiem for a Friend\\"<br />You've heard the parable of the five blind men who examined an elephant, to find it \\"like a rope, a tree, a wall, a spear, or a snake\\", depending on whether they encountered tail, leg, torso, tusk, or trunk?  The polarities of the other 68 reviews remind me of that parable.  I must comment to three: to 5-star \\"Mindboggling!!!!\\", who said, \\"...should be the new \\"Bible\\"!!!\\"; I liked it, too.  But please, let's not.  We've religions enough; to 1-star \\"The only book I ever trashed ... \\", who threw it away, because, \\"To sell it would have made me feel guilty that someone might read it and believe it.\\"; On behalf of the libraries to which you deprived a donation, thanks.  Check out Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" at the library nearest you.  You may find yourself.  And to those who raked Talbot over the coals for his \\"unscientific\\" approach, I recommend your re-read his introduction, and understand his intention.  For works of a sufficiently scientific approach, explore his 25 page bibliography.<br />Part one begins, \\"Sit down before fact like a little child, and be prepared to give up every preconceived notion, to follow humbly wherever and to whatever abyss Nature leads, or you shall learn nothing.\\"  T. H. Huxley, quoted on the overleaf.  Part One so thoroughly drew me in that I could not put the book down.<br />Chapter 1:  The Brain as Hologram (Pribram).  Memory; local or non-local, that is the question.  Do specific memories reside in specific locations (cells)?  That they do is stipulated as the commonly accepted view.  That they do not is put forward with evidence from Pribram's work, along with that of Penfield, Lashley, and others.  Hologram fundamentals are reviewed (keep in mind \\"reference beam\\", \\"object beam\\", and \\"interference pattern\\").  Eyesight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste are spoken of as operating in frequency spectrums.  How does associative memory work?  And photographic memory?  The statement that \\"there is evidence that neurons respond individually to narrow bands of frequencies\\" (everything has a resonant frequency) leapt off the page at me.  The inference I take from it is that, in a holographic model for memory ~ and consciousness itself ~ our five senses provide the \\"reference beams\\".  Talbot touches upon transference of motor skills, phantom limb phenomena, and the idea that the brain employs Fourier Transform to process and comprehend sensory input.  He concludes by alluding to Pribram pondering the implications of his theory with respect to the nature of reality and how we experience it.<br />Chapter 2: The Cosmos as Hologram (Bohm).  Quanta only behave as particles when we look at them; they are interconnected (both at a distance, instantaneously, and with near-conscious, self sustaining behavior, in a plasma).  Physicist Nick Herbert is quoted, \\"...Likewise humans can never experience the true texture of quantum reality because everything we touch turns to matter.\\"  It's a very small leap from there to infer that our brain's cognitive processes influence the physical world as much as the physical world influences us.<br /><br />The remaining seven chapters are an exploration of these ideas and relate to a variety of phenomena: placebo effect, dreams, hypnosis, psychedelic drugs and psychedelic experiences WITHOUT drugs, shamanism, precognition, near death experiences ~~~ everything but the kitchen sink.  I cannot express my thoughts here succinctly enough to fit the word count limit.  Be prepared for an excursion into things for which there is no explanation, and to which \\"pure science\\" replies \\"insufficient evidence\\".  There was so much material concerning psychic phenomena that at times it seemed as though Talbot was shouting \\"Look,look!  You cannot ignore this.\\"  But then, for the most part my own spiritual beliefs already accommodate things that he seemed intent of providing overwhelming evidence to support.  I just have evidence enough of my own (experiential, not \\"empirical\\") that it wasn't necessary.  Most of it I did find fascinating.  The only exception was Talbot's personal experiences with \\"poltergeist\\" phenomena, which, while I understand their influence on his curiosity, seemed to detract a bit from the body of evidence he presents.<br />Personally, I'm not overly impressed with phenomena, and do not hunger for it.  Truth impresses me.  Alot.  That's  where my particular appetite peaks.  And I think Talbot is on to something true.  \\"Holographic Universe\\" was an epiphany for me.<br />I'll concede  \\"Holographic Universe\\" is not \\"purely scientific\\" enough for stalwart academics.  it may well be a map to the \\"Rosetta Stone\\" for how human consciousness functions within the quantum universe: a \\"sneak preview\\" to a \\"theory of everything\\" that has the capacity to account for human \\"mystical\\" experience, including a plausible explanation of the form and function of the human soul.  Name any \\"pure scientist\\" who did not, at least in private life, ponder \\"purely unscientific\\" philosophical implications of their work in the context of a higher meaning.  I cannot. Talbot portrays Pribram and Bohm as deserving, for their departure from the \\"orthodox\\" view, their own unwritten chapters in \\"Profiles in Courage\\".<br />\\"Everywhere I go, I find the poet has been there before me.\\" ~~ Jung<br />\\"We transform these things; they are not real, they are only the reflection upon the polished surface of our being ...\\" ~~ Rilkeok, look!  You cannot ignore this.\\"  But then, for the most part my own spiritual beliefs already accommodate things that he seemed intent of providing overwhelming evidence to support.

B00005NW02|3.0|System of a down.  First CD was unbelieveable.  This one...well, different story.  It starts off good with prison song, moving into needles i am beginning to wonder what the hell happened to Systum.  From there the songs on the CD don't sound ANYTHING like the first one.  Bands that are alledgedly &quot;against our government,&quot; but like capitalism, do this.  Keep the ideas the same, but weaken the music.  Lyrics to this CD are great (most of the songs) I just wish the music sound was more like the first CD...gives me the impression that System in a way sold themselves out.  Hopefully the next CD will capture their older, much heavier sound.  I also like serji's voice a lot more on the first CD.  :(  please come back to us System of a Down, not the band that put their name in a HOLLYWOOD BANNER to cover their CD.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is a fascinating, complex movie that you could easily walk right by in the video store. Don't. The packaging is ridiculous - the movie didn't garner much attention at the movie theater, so in order to boost video sales, they've made it look like a typical teen horror movie, complete with ubercheesy tagline - \\"Be Afraid Of The Dark.\\" <br />In reality, Donnie Darko is like what Rushmore would be if it were made by David Lynch. Set in October of 1988, for reasons I have yet to figure out, we have the protagonist, Donnie Darko, a suburban teenager who may be schizophrenic, or a time traveler. He receives messages from a man-sized demented rabbit named Frank, who tells him that there are 28 days, 6 hours, 48 minutes and 12 seconds (roughly) until the End Of The World. <br />There is an inspired use of 80's hipster-pop songs, but this is done sparingly, to make the scenes more memorable. One that sticks out in my mind is the day after Donnie's house (more specifically, his room) meets with a strange fate, we see a surreal, slightly eerie montage of Donnie's private high school, shot in varying speeds, accompanied by Tears for Fears' \\"Head Over Heels\\". <br />The characters are so undeniably nuanced that it should put American Beauty's one-dimensional family to shame. We're introduced to the Darko family at dinner, when the daughter announces that she's voting for Dukakis (remember, '88). From a normal movie, we'd expect the typical conflict between uptight suburban parents and liberal college-bound daughter. Instead, the parents pretty much shrug their shoulders,and the conversation denigrates into vulgar namecalling - which amuses the parents, not horrifying them. I wanted to peg them off the bat as \\"typical movie Republicans\\", real white bread, conformist conservative types. But the movie won't let you do that. Later on there's a scene where Donnie's mom sublimely puts down a heady school teacher who wants to ban a \\"controversial\\" book. But the effect is less of triumph than of a subtle tedium with the rest of the imbeciles in the PTA. <br />The acting is superb and really makes the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal (sp?) has a big, open face that he uses to his advantage. He is totally believable as that most tiresome of movie stereotypes, the troubled genius. He really deserves to be a bigger star - he is very talented and I hope to see him in more movies like this one and less like Bubble Boy. He's a real cutie, too, in that antihero way that reminded me of Jason Schwartzman from Rushmore. The actress who plays his mother is amazing - it seemed like she was always holding back and I spent the entire movie really trying to figure her out. <br />I don't think I totally know what the movie is eventually about, but I see it as a sort of demented \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" where Jimmy Stewart finds out that the happy Bedford Falls is really a dream and that the world really would have been better if he hadn't been born. It's an odd sort of existentialist film, and I certainly could be wrong in my interpretation, but that was what I first thought of. The darkness of the theme made me gasp in its audacity.
B00005JGAF|5.0|You could put this record on at a FUNERAL and people would start bopping their heads, and maybe even dance.  It just doesn't get any better!
B00000JGOJ|4.0|Miramax, the premiere producer and distributor of independent films in the world, gave Playing by Heart a limited and uninspired theatrical release in January 1999. They sold it as a comedy. It's actually a drama. Perhaps Miramax was too busy promoting its hugely successful Oscar contenders, Shakespeare in Love and Life is Beautiful. Whatever the case, don't let the fact that you may not have heard of Playing by Heart deter you. It's a fine movie and a welcome alternative to the cartoonish megahits we were offered this summer. <br />Essentially, the film is a study of how people handle the powerful emotion called love. The couples we meet range from the very young to the old. As we watch these people deal with affairs of the heart, it is slowly revealed to us that each of them is somehow involved with everyone else. I won't tell you how.<br />Leading the fantastic cast are Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands, who play Paul and Hannah, a couple on the eve of their fortieth wedding anniversary. Amidst the joy, a new problem and an old one threaten to ruin the occasion. Hugh and Gracie [Dennis Quaid and Madeline Stowe] have been married fourteen years. They have forgotten how to love one another. Meredith [Gillian Anderson] is the bitter victim of a marriage that failed for reasons neither she nor her ex-husband could prevent. She has adopted the hard edge of a person who believes that love will never work for her. When she meets Roger [Anthony Edwards], the attraction is there, but her acquired defense mechanisms make the relationship seem doomed. When young actress, Joan [Angelina Jolie], spies Keenan [Ryan Philippe] in a hot disco, she falls for the kid. Keenan has a major broken heart, and Joan has her work cut out for her. Finally, Mildred [Ellen Burstyn] must reach out to her estranged son, Mark [Jay Mohr], who is dying of AIDS.<br />I think Miramax decided to call this a comedy because director Willard Carroll delivered a sophisticated movie. You cannot have a film devoted to the subject of love without having scenes where hankies are required. He shows these moments without dwelling on them. He quickly moves on to the next event. And he does find a lot of humor in the frustrations and the self-doubts that come with love. <br />I had a couple of problems with Playing by Heart, but both of them were fairly minor. The subject matter is one more commonly associated with French and Italian movies. It is not one we Americans are incapable of doing well, but often, as here, we put so many stars in the vehicle that it gets overwhelmed. Happily, the ones in Playing From the Heart are generally excellent actors. The movie also suffers a bit from being too well constructed and written. The result is that several of the couples are interesting enough to fill a whole picture on their own, and we feel a bit cheated that we saw so little of them. Despite these little flaws, it remains one of the best and most original romantic movies of late.<br />There is such a wide age range in these love stories that one or more is bound to affect you. My personal favorite was the young couple, Keenan and Joan. They seemed such a perfect fit. Angelina Jolie is a consummate actress, and she may have inspired Ryan Philippe to give his best performance to date.

0780626494|3.0|On one level, Blast Form the Past could be a whole lot better. On another, it's just fine as it is. In other words, it may not live up to it's potential, but it's still entertaining.<br />The movie starts in 1962 and it quickly points out humorously that this was a very strange time. America had never been more affluent. New inventions were making life easier and easier. Life was good. Yet paranoia over our Communist enemies was never higher. Beneath the laughter and the good times lay a sense of impending atomic doom. Fallout shelters were all the rage. <br />We meet Calvin and Helen Webber [Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek], a popular Los Angeles couple. Calvin, who is a scientist, is particularly afraid of the Communist menace. He has somehow secretly constructed an underground shelter the size of a super Wal-Mart. One night a news broadcast convinces him that nuclear war may be at hand. He drags his thoroughly confused and very pregnant wife into the shelter. Moments later an out of control US fighter jet happens to crash and burn on top of their house. The explosion prompts Calvin to lock the shelter down. The couple is trapped there for over two decades. <br />Some of the best parts of Blast From the Past show Calvin and Helen, along with Adam, the son she bears, passing the years underground. Adam [Brendan Fraser] grows up to be a strapping, well educated and polite young man. Naturally he gives new meaning to the term sheltered!<br />Meanwhile, life goes on apace above their heads. The old neighborhood goes downhill. This transition is neatly portrayed by the evolution of a family business, which starts out as a soda shop and ends up a dive bar. <br />When the locks finally open the shelter, Calvin ventures up. It takes about five minutes for him to decided that the world is now a place inhabited by mutants. The experience causes him to collapse and take to his bed. Adam must then go up and replenish their supplies. <br />It is here that the movie could be a lot better. The idea of a man who has been frozen in time and then sets off into the present world has all sorts of comic possibilities. Blast Form the Past does not explore much of this. Instead, it concentrates on Adam's search for a wife, aided by the delightful and talented Alicia Silverstone, whose character is named [you guessed it] Eve. She is naturally distrustful of him because she thinks he is mad. His saying only that he is from out of town doesn't help. <br />My main problem here is that Adam, who has never seen any human beings other than his nutty parents, is too quick to adapt to present day Los Angeles. He is the perfect gentleman, raised in a much more repressed culture, yet he seems unaffected by Eve's revealing attire or by her penchant for cursing like a sailor. In their search for a wife, she takes him to a disco, where it turns out he's a fabulous dance. It's good to know that Brendan Fraser is so talented in this department, but it doesn't seem like something Adam could do.<br />What saves the movie is the affecting romance that develops between Adam and Eve. While it's obvious that this is going to occur, it is still a sweet and wholly innocent situation. While the film does not go in a more innovative direction, which would have made it a more satisfying experience, a la The Truman Show, it does wind up be a charming romantic comedy.
0446677450|5.0|If you are just getting started on the road to learning about finacial success, this is the best place to start.  If this book doesn't trigger new ideas and interest, I don't know what would.  It is very easy to understand.  The downfall is that becuase it is such a beginner's book, there are no specifics on how to actually make money.  You will also be caught into buying and reading the next two books.  I also recommend these (Cashflow quadrants and guide to investing), but many stories and ideas get to be very repetative.  Another book on this level I would recommend is Creating Wealth, by Robert Allen.  Creating Wealth is very basic as well, but gets into how the author made his money a little bit more than Kiyosaki does.
0783235380|3.0|In the realm of romantic comedy, Forces of Nature might be described as earnest. Its makers intended to make something original, and while they did not succeed, it was not from lack of trying. The laughs and, to a degree, the romance are here, but the movie never reaches the heights it aims for.<br />Ben and Bridget [Ben Affleck and Maury Tierney] are to be wed in a few days at her parents' home in Savannah. He is to fly from New York City for the event. Ben writes blurbs for book jackets for a living. He's a somewhat stuffy fellow who never lets himself go. On the airplane, he meets Sarah [Sandra Bullock], a whacky free spirits with a heart of gold - the kind who exists only in movies. [You know this character. It's the one that makes a complete mess of life, yet always ends up somehow nobler than everyone else.] She tries to strikes up a merry conversation with the reticent Ben. Her attempts are interrupted when a seagull gets sucked into one of the plane's engines. This causes the craft to veer off the runway while attempting take off. Unscathed, the two find themselves hitching a ride with a mad man. Thus begins their often hilarious road trip together. Ben must make it to the wedding on time, and Sarah must get to Savannah for her own reasons. <br />Forces of Nature is Bullock's third foray into playing a romantic lead, and it is her best attempt. It is Affleck's first try. There is a certain amount of chemistry between the two leads, but I am convinced that Bullock's forte will eventual prove to be in other areas. This is not necessarily a negative criticism, for the same can be said of Glenn Close, Sigourney Weaver and Meryl Streep. As for Affleck, he still exhibits an immaturity which does not lend itself well to this kind of role. <br />Most of the humor is not provided by the two stars. It comes in the form of the characters they run into, whose observations about relationships and marriage are sharp and witty. Interest is also provided by a series of calamities, many of them natural, which conspire to delay the couple from reaching their destination. <br />The film's major flaw, unfortunately, is its ending. Given the premise that the forces of nature will conspire to keep you from going down the wrong path in life, the conclusion seems exceptionally unnatural.
B00000K19E|3.0|One can only wonder how good this movie could have been if it focused more on the intellectual complexity of the plot than on fancy FX action sequences.  Still, it serves as a great [story].  Fishburne doesn't get enough credit for how good of an actor he is.  He carries this movie (for an even better example of an actor saving an underachieving script, check out Fishburne in \\"Event Horizon\\")...I don't have much confidence that Part II will be anything more than typical action fare...given the potential of the fundamental idea behind \\"The Matrix\\", I hope I'm wrong.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Shakespeare in Love is the David that toppled the Goliath, Saving Private Ryan, in the 1999 Oscar race. It won seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actress [Gwenyth Paltrow] and Best Supporting Actress [Judi Dench] vs. Ryan's five awards. Both are great movies, and the Steven Spielburg war epic may be technically the better one. I think Shakespeare in Love won because it is not a film you revere or admire. It is one you love.<br />What we have here is a lark, a frolic, a bawdy Elizabethan romp played by a cast that's as first rate as they come. It has some fine dramatic moments, but it is, first and foremost, a highly original romantic comedy. The year is 1593. Will Shakespeare is in London struggling with writer's block, as well as poverty. To make matters worse, the city is just getting over another bout with the plague. Public places, such as theaters, have been closed for weeks, and the owner of The Rose, the playhouse where Will's plays are performed, is in desperate need of a hit. Shakespeare claims to have nearly finished a comedy called Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. <br />In a mansion across town lives the beautiful Viola, whose wealthy father is planning to marry her off [with an enormous dowry] to the cash-poor Lord Wessex. The insipid Wessex will get Viola and a lot of gold, and Dad will get a title. In those days, women had no say in little things like their entire futures Viola seems resigned to her fate, yet she's a high-spirited spot. One day she goes to one of Queen Elizabeth's palaces to see a performance of some of Shakespeare's work, which she already knows by heart. Soon afterwards, she dresses as a boy and auditions for Will's new play. She has no other option, as men in those days played both the male and the female roles. Actresses didn't exist. She gets the part of Romeo. One thing leads to another, and the fallout started by Viola's, as well as Will's, deception starts coming in fast, furious and madcap waves. <br />Then thereis that cast. It is what elevates the movie far beyond what it should have been. Gwyneth Paltrow is extraordinary as Viola. While other young actresses appear to have built their careers in a random way, Ms. Paltrow seems to have used each successive role as a building block. Ironically, her only real competition for the Oscar was Cate Blanchette, who played Queen Elizabeth in another movie. The Best Supporting Actress here is Judi Dench who plays, yes, Queen Elizabeth. In another odd twist, Dench was nominated the previous year for Best Actress in Mrs. Brown, in which she played that other big Queen, Victoria. Joseph Fiennes, who sparkles as Will Shakespeare, also played Cate Blanchett's lover in Elizabeth. As Lord Essex, Colin Firth plays one of the funniest villains we've seen in some time. Also marvelous are Geoffrey Rush and Tom Wilkinson as Henslow and Fenneyman. <br />The dialog is so clever that only upon the second viewing did I realized how much I had missed. The scenery and costumes are sumptuous. Stephen Warbeck's musical score is a classic. It also won an Oscar. <br />Shakespeare in Love is not a parody of the Bard. It is a tribute to him and his time. This is not history. We have no record of Viola. Wessex plans to take her off to his plantation in the Virginia colony. This would have been quite a feat, since the colony was not founded until fourteen years after the movie takes place. None of this matters a bit. We know very little about Shakespeare. In fact, we know next to nothing. It is doubtful that what we know as Romeo and Juliet could have evolved in this fasion. We know that this remarkable tale is pure fiction, but we wish with all our hearts that it had really happened.

B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is a stunning sci-fi thriller from the remarkable Wachowski brothers, who CO-wrote and CO-directed it. With just a couple of small independent films under their belts, the Wachowskis were somehow able to propel themselves into the front line of big budget film making. So skittish was the management team at Warner Brothers over the project that it opted to take on an Australian finical partner. Making The Matrix in Australia further lowered Warner's risk. Now that the film is a worldwide smash hit, the company must split the profits and the credit. Welcome to the New Hollywood, a place run by business types who make decisions based not on gut instinct, but on a wealth of computer data. Ironically, The Matrix is about the fate of a world that carries its reliance on computers too far. <br />The movie opens in the year 1999. Or is it 1999 at all? We find Tom Anderson living two lives. By day he is an employee at a powerful software company. By night he is a computer hacker known as Neo. Without giving the plot away, I can say that all his life, Anderson has felt that the world is somehow vaguely askew. In his secret life on the Internet, he has become obsessed with a man know only as Morpheus, who is wanted by the authorities for computer sabotage. One night he is lead to a disco where he meets a strange and beautiful girl called Trinity. She is also a hacker and can arrange for him to meet Morpheus. The plot then gets very thick indeed. <br />In another irony, I have never seen a film that integrates computer graphics and effects into the story as well as The Matrix does. The subject matter demands a heavy reliance on special effects. In fact, prior to the introduction of digital technology, such a movie would have been extremely difficult to make. Its theme and tone are much like another sci-fi classic, Blade Runner, but that earlier movie did not have to bend the rules of space and time in the ways The Matrix does. <br />Despite all it technical wizardry,The Matrix's driving force is its riveting thriller of a story. Glorious special effects, for once, enhance the memorable characters. The theme may owe its origins to the best of the comic books, but this does not detract from it, any more than it did from the first Superman and Batman movies. <br />Keanu Reeves is excellent as Neo. It's not the kind of performance that wins an Oscar. It's the kind one remembers long after one forgets who won the Oscar. Like the late Cary Grant, Reeves is more star and personality than actor. Grant played Grant better than anyone else, and only Reeves can play Reeves. Laurence Fishburne gives his usual strong yet thoughtful performance in the role of Morpheus. Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity with both relish and style. <br />The Matrix is a big, splashy show, and it is less spectacular on video than it was on the big screen. Still, most of the big events play reasonable well when shrunk down, and the story itself is perhaps a bit enhanced on video. <br />Both a thrill ride and a thought provoking look at mankind's tenuous relationship with reality, The Matrix is unlike any movie you are likely to see this year. In fact, I haven't admired a high profile sci-fi thriller this much since Alien, Aliens and Blade Runner in the early 1980s.
B00005OAIE|5.0|The first song I ever heard of John Mayer's was \\"Love Song For No One.\\" I heard it on the city radio, but back at home they didn't play him anymore. I downloaded some more of his music, and I loved it! I got addicted. Finally I bought the CD,.... His music is an awesome cross between Lifehouse and Dave Matthews Band. The songs are cathcy, flowing, and his voice puts you in a better mood. Get this CD if you are a music fan!
B00001PE4D|4.0|The delightfully wicked and clever Cruel Intentions is the fourth movie version of Les Liasons Dangereuses, Choderlos de Laclos' 18th Century novel about some very dangerous emotional games played by a group of amoral upper-class Frenchmen. This is the first version that takes this two-hundred year old tale and places it in modern day New York City. In the original, Kathryn and Valmont were in their 30s. Cruel Intentions makes them teenagers. That this update works as well as it does is a credit to its makers.<br />Kathryn and Valmont [Sarah Michelle Geller and Ryan Phillipe] are two spoiled yuppie brats whose hobby in life is to bring as much misery in life to others as they can. The really fun part of this evil game is to devise their plots so that they themselves emerge unscathed. Kathryn is the obvious Game Master, for while Valmont has garnered a bad reputation to all who know him, she is still seen as an icon of virtue. She is student body president at the posh private school they attend. Teachers, parents and students consider her a role model. For this reason, she is the more dangerous of the two.<br />Kathryn's mother is Valmont's stepmother. She and Valmont's Dad travel constantly. The kids are free to do as they please. They are sexually attracted to each other, but Kathryn is far too manipulative to allow anything beyond fooling around to occur. This makes Valmont her slave, although he is too vain to realize it. <br />Kathryn learns that her boyfriend has dumped her for her school's new headmaster's daughter, Annette [Reese Witherspoon]. Kathryn, of course, never loved the boy. Highly placed socially, he was merely convenient for her. Her fury stems from the fact that she's used to being the one who does the dumping. Annette has written an article for a big magazine. She explains the reasons why she is putting off having sex until she finds true love. Kathryn makes a wager with Valmont. If he can't seduce Annette, his sports car is hers. If he can, sheis his prize. Her body, she believes, is worth wagering in order to destroy Annette's reputation. <br />Valmont accepts the bet and begins to pursue Annette. What follows is a story full of deceit, treachery and surprise. <br />Sarah Michelle Geller, the star of TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, once seemed to be stick in the horror genre. Her movies include I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream 2. With Cruel Intentions, she makes a bold move to more sophisticated roles. Ryan Phillipe is a hot commodity these days, but has yet to get a part which can prove whether or not he can really act. Reese Witherspoon will probably become a star. Her turns in Election and Pleasantville, as well as this movie, have been very satisfactory. In her role as Cecile, Kathryn and Valmont's ditzy friend, Selma Blair steals every scene she is in.<br />As good as it is, Cruel Intentions is no match for the incomparable Dangerous Liasons, starring Glenn Close. Yet, it is vastly entertaining. The story remains a great one. The ending has been altered, but it fits the update. Making the main characters teenagers who are sophisticated and old beyond their years works well.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I have always been a fan of NO Doubt, so I bought this CD without hesitation. Many of the critics were saying that the CD was horrible, and not like the rest. Now, I will admit that you do catch a different vibe from Rock Steady, but their initial voice is still there in songs like &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot;, &quot;Making Out&quot;, and &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;. The other songs seem to be fresh and funky, with Gwen's flowing voice. All the songs are great, and I recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a great new CD.
0345440900|4.0|I admit it, the fact that Tracy Hogg's system classifies my daughter as an Angel baby earned this book a few points right off the bat.  But there is much more to it than that.<br />At the heart of this book is the E.A.S.Y. method.  I can't say enough about this sytem; eat - activity - sleep - you in two to four hour stretches, depending on your baby.  Within days of implementing this method, I could read my baby.  What does this mean?  To all you soon-to-be Mom's, it means consistency and predictability, and those my friends are the keys to sanity.  I could plan my day in a way that my baby enjoyed while still meeting the needs of my whole family.  I felt much more confident and in control.  My husband and I got to concentrate on all the amazing qualities of our daughter, while still having order in our lives (which early on seems like liitle more than the ability to shower and do the laundry).  <br />Buy it.

But I've read other books on the subject and have not gotten as much use from it as I have this book.<br />In the first few chapters, you'll already begin to memorize things that you thought couldn't be memorized. I still remember a practice list of random objects in the first couple chapters, with no review or real thought about it since I purchased it back about 2 or 3 years ago (I can't remember when I purchased it, but can still remember the list - ironic, no?).<br />As much as I enjoyed this book and think how much it has helped me...this book did not provide me with solutions to memory issues such as \\"where I placed my keys\\" or \\"where I parked the car\\". However, I have memorized Pi to over 100 digits now using the techniques of this book.<br />Overall, this was a great book, as well as an enjoyable read. For memory books of it's genre, I highly recommend it.

B000040OBS|5.0|Suicide were an anti-rock punk duo from New York City. Vocalist Alan Vega - think Iggy without any lust for life - would occasionally attack audiences with a large bike chain, but this 1977 debut was far more confrontational. Apparemtly, you don't need hard riffin' guitars to musically represent an utterly debased humanity: no, knackered keyboards and a cheapo drum machine will do (both handled by Martin Rev). The sound was Kraftwerk go rockabilly in hell. The cover featured lurid globules of blood. Vega's howls suggested that he hated you personally and would relish the opportunity to drag you down with him. When they supported the Clash, even punks hated them.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Part of the success behind the film's humor is the undercurrent of truth behind its skewering of the fashion industry--and I don't mean the \\"X-Files\\"-esque conspiracy theory of clothiers putting out contracts on world leaders to protect their profits.  Modelling, even male modelling, is incredibly cutthroat, with the models treated more like cash crops rather than human beings: E! reporter Jules Asner, whose coworker Steve Kmetko appears in here, admitted in a \\"Maxim\\" interview that in the early days of her brief modelling career she and Cindy Crawford shared a bunkbed in a bunkroom/storage locker similar to the one Derek wakes up in after his week of programming at Mugatu's daiye spa.  The Skyy vodka ad of Derek that gets covered up after he loses his VH1 Male Model crown is a spoof of that brand's ad campaign that inspired Derek's look(s), which Ben Stiller claims is supposed to duplicate Marilyn Monroe without actually dressing up like her.  Will Ferrell is absolutely hilarious as evil fashion mogul Jacobim Mugatu with his wacky hairstyle, stereotypically-gay-sounding voice, and lines like \\"Obey my dog!\\" and \\"You learn martial arts!  Prime Minister BAD!  Martial arts GOOD!\\" as was Owen Wilson's hippie antics, entourage, and his ninja-like folding and deploying of a Razor scooter.

0380788624|4.0|Well, it seems that Neal has done it again, made a damn fine read that is. The book starts a little slow, mingled with world war II anecdotes of sorts and cyber crime/business (arent they one and the same?). The dream is clear but the plot isnt, data heaven, a place for every high time crim to place their not-so-secure funds to make them 100% secure.<br />The book has a tight plot with loose ends that are quickly bundled into a firm rigging. The end leaves a little to be desired, but I wont give it away. Just think cheesy. The end was the only reason I gave it 4. Otherwise it's a modem masterpiece.
B00003CXB7|5.0|Although M*A*S*H is probably his most audience-friendly film, Robert Altman's style of over-lapping dialogue and multiple themes provokes a divided reaction even in this early work: you either like it or you don't.  Perhaps more significant, however, are expectations raised by the popular and long-running television series the film inspired: the series concerned likable characters playing situation comedy with a dramatic spin, and viewers who expect to see this repeated in the film will be disappointed--and very probably outraged as well.  Like most Altman films, M*A*S*H is character-driven, and there is no plot in any traditional sense.  In general, the film concerns three surgeons (Hawkeye, Trapper, and Duke, here played by Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould, and Tom Skerritt) who are drafted to serve in Korea.  Sharing a mutual fondness for martinis and a complete disrespect for all things military, they run riot through the M*A*S*H 4077, mocking the efforts of by-the-book military officers to make them toe the line and using the army's need of their skills to prevent higher authority from penalizing them for their antics.  Most of the characters (including the three leads) are at best unsympathetic, and the film's comic elements are deliberately grotesque, mean-spirited, blasphemous, sexist, and vulgar.<br />Altman clearly intends us to read the Korean setting as a metaphor for Vietnam and the disrespect for an inept military authority as a metaphor for America's increasing disenchantment with military intervention in Vietnam; at the same time, the film's graphic surgery scenes provide us with a clear vision of the human toll war requires.  Because the film mixes these points of view with comic elements, it is frequently described as an anti-war black comedy--but the film is so profoundly bitter that the word comedy, even when codified as \\"black,\\" is rather misleading.  There are certainly comic elements and even a few laugh-out-loud moments (most centering upon Margaret \\"Hotlips\\" O'Houlihan, brilliantly played by Sally Kellerman), but the tone of the film is so bitter that the laughter induced is very rueful indeed. Seen today, M*A*S*H feels slightly uneven in execution and very much of its place and time--but even so the cast performs with an extremely compelling immediacy and Altman's dark and multi-layered vision makes a powerful statement.  The DVD release features a superb restoration of the film, a rather dismissable director's commentary track, and four short documentaries re the film which are extremely interesting but often redundant.  Fans of Altman in general or this film in particular will find the DVD a must-have.  While I do recommend the film to newcomers, I offer the warning that response to the film varies considerably from individual to individual.  Whatever the case, M*A*S*H was and is a landmark film that deserves a place in any serious DVD library.rgaret \\"Hotlips\\" O'Houlihan, brilliantly played by Sally Kellerman), but the tone of the film is so bitter that the laughter induced is very rueful indeed.

0385474547|3.0|This book was one of the most average books I've read. The tribal life was very interesting, and the themes were significant, but I felt like it was too anticlimactic. I was still wondering about Ezinma and Chielo, and why she was taken for the night. Was it just to cure her, or is she going to talk to the gods? I hated the ending, but I agree that that is what should have happened. I only had an interest in Okonkwo part of the time. I did like how he was given flaws, though. I think it could have been a much better novel.

I read it at a rate of about 100-150 pages a day (plus, I was reading another novel for school at the same time).  Excellent.  Lots of action, love, and even ninjas!  Clavell is an incredible narrorator.  So what if there were a few discrepencies?  It is all based on the adventures of real-life Brittish pilot William Adams (John Blackthorne).  One of the only love stories that has ever choked me up (I almost cried).  It will change your whole idea of romance, and you'll start to think of John aka Anjinsan and Mariko when you hear your fav. love song.  I also loved how it showed the contrast between cultures, and teaches us to respect everyone.  Check it out, it's well worth the $[money]! Now on to Taipan, Noblehouse, Gaijin, King Rat...I just found a new favorite author!

B00005QG9J|3.0|...I really liked Make Yourself, and Morning View is decent, but I've come to notice...that all Incubus singles sound essentially the same.  This is a common criticism of tons of bands.  But we're talking melody of the hits - really, all the same.  I'm not ignoring the other tracks, but let's just take the first two big hits as examples (and this holds true with other tracks on Make Yourself as well.)  The only way I can present it is to phoenetically \\"sing\\" the song to you.<br />I wish you were here: \\"IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII, wish you were here.\\"<BR>Nice to know you: \\"Goodbyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyye, nice to know you.\\"  <br />Now I hate to be petty, but I own the CD, and when I first heard the latter of these two songs on the radio, touted as the \\"second single\\", I really thought the DJs were mistaken for a week or two, until I finally cleared the matter up.  Truly, as with \\"stellar\\", these two songs are virtually IDENTICAL in the chorus ( and the chorus is why we purchase records, is it not?).  I find that cheap and unorginal...
B00005UEAR|1.0|After following these guys since their first album, I have heard them offer new and exciting ideas - until Falling Into Infinity.  Since then they've leveled-off compositionally and lyrically.  At times the music on this work smacks of Pantera or Pink Floyd. And while no other band beats them when it comes to the chops, I have to say that they would be better off allowing some of their former producers back into the studio to help them regain the vintage, glorious Dream Theater sound they once produced.
B000002C1V|5.0|This has to be my favorite Pink Floyd album, along with The Wall. People like to say it was a Roger Waters' solo album and I agree. In my opinion, Waters was always the heart and soul of the band. Certainly the albums that followed The Final Cut were horrible attempts at pop status. With Waters, there was a darkness and grit to the band. They made beautiful songs about very dark topics. Personally, I never felt Gilmour was anything more than a studio musician. In the Final Cut you have a continuation of the wall, full of the same themes. And like The Wall, there is a light at the end of the tunnell. &quot;The Gunner's Dream&quot; and &quot;Not Now John&quot; are just two of the classic songs on this album. However, I would say that this album is their greatest, because every song is so strong. Only The Wall and The Final Cut have that in common, every song being equally great. Sadly, this should have been the last Pink Floyd album, they would have gone out on top with it. However, Gilmour had to attempt to milk the name for some more money. Great concept album!

0471413909|1.0|Dr. Cordain has attempted to jump on the &quot;low-carb&quot; popularity trend but has missed the mark by a mile. I am personally on a truly low-carb diet and eat lots of saturated fats which have given me AWESOME health. My previous high risk cholesterol ratios, blood pressure and weight have returned to PERFECTLY NORMAL. He claims his diet is low-carbohydrate but it certainly is NOT at 30-40% carbs. He also attempts to make a connection between the hunter-gatherer Paleolithic people and his diet, which it is NOT. The hunter-gatherers ate a very high-fat, low-carb diet, and he is proposing a low-fat, high-carb diet. As an example: Dr. Cordain says correctly that wild deer, which he used as an example of Paleo food, is 40% protein and 60% fat. Yet, he suggest people eat a low-fat deer roast cut of 19% fat with all the exposed fat trimmed off. Paleo people ate the high energy fat that threw away the lean meat. His diet is basically the same as the Zone 40-30-30 (c-p-f). It is well known that this diet works for thin, younger people only. Older people or those with a existing over-weight problem will actually get fatter on this diet and develope age-related degenerative diseases. Dr. Cordain says the Paleo people would eat eggs but rarely had the opportunity. Yet, he suggest that eating fruit shipped to your local store from worldwide sources and available 365 days of the year is a Paleo diet. The truth is the Paleo people ate lots of fat and preferred the fat. They wasted the lean meat in times of plenty just as primitive people have done in recent years. The Paleo people had very limited availability of carbohydrate foods, a very limited varity and a very limited season. Some primitive people had NO carbohydrate food available 9 months of the year in northern locations. Dr. Cordain taught in the past that the Paleo people were vegetarian, and he was also a vegetarian at that time. Dr. Cordain's book is full of contradictions which lack logic. He provided a list of reference books but not one reference scientific study to support his assumptions.

My Heart Will Go On will be the song she is remembered for, but she has never and will never produce a finer album than.<br />It's All Coming Back To Me Now is a masterpiece.  Dion displays a tremendous vocal range in this song.  Once she starts singing, there are hardly any breaks in the song.  Dion lives up to the task and is the complete driving force in this song.  While often forgotten in favor of her movie songs, I would consider this her best song ever.<BR>Fly is an incredibly moving song on this album.  She sings it to her niece, and you can feel the emotion coming through the song.  They played this song at the ESPY Awards(espn's sports awards) in tribute to the football coach of Columbine High School and it was one of the most moving moments I've ever seen.  It made athletes cry.<BR>This album is the only album I own where I enjoy listening to every song.  There is not one song that I would even consider average for Celine Dion's standards.  <BR>It is by far her best album ever and one of the best albums music has seen.  It most certianly deserved to be Album of the Year at the Grammys.
B00005RY7X|5.0|You remember the first time you heard Guns n' Roses' Appetite for Destruction, don't you?  It blew you away!  Well, I'm not saying that I Get Wet is on the level of Appetite, but it might not be as far off as you think!  You haven't heard anything like this for at least 10 years.  In the meantime, grunge had its heyday and produced some great bands.  Then mope-metal came to the forefront.  You know what I'm talking about - `It's been awhile...', `In the end, it doesn't even matter...', etc.  Well, Andrew W.K. isn't having any of it!  Enough whining - it's time to party!  That's right - it doesn't matter who you are, throughout this masterpiece of an album, Andrew W.K. implores you to party...<br />Let's see - `Party Hard' is the first single and it will be huge!  `Girls Own Love' is probably my favorite right now and has the potential to be a mega-hit since it's so filled with hooks.  `Ready to Die' has the catchiest, cheapest-sounding keyboard riff you've heard in a long time.  `I Love NYC' is another instant classic that you'll be singing along to every time it comes on.  Even non-New Yorkers are going to love that one.  `She Is Beautiful' will get in your head and I guarantee you'll be singing it to yourself long after the song is over - that transition from `she is beautiful, the girl is beautiful' to `I ain't got nothin' to lose' is just too catchy.  `Got to Do It' is also great with its Springsteen-esque intro and chorus. <br />There's not a bad song in the bunch and that's incredibly rare as you well know.  I've read that Andrew W.K. says he wants to make people happy with his music and this album certainly meets that goal.  I Get Wet is pure hedonism and when you put it on, it's time to forget your worries and party.  There will be high-brow haters who say the lyrics on this album are dumb, but believe me, neither you, me, nor Andrew W.K. want them at our party anyway!
6302732778|1.0|I totally agree with one of your customers,who felt that the new &quot;Director's Cut&quot; version of Bladerunner was inferior to the original theatrical release. I am a fan of Ridley Scott's,and definitely am in favor of a the director being the sole source of what the final cut of a feature should be. But,that being said,I am vehemently in disagreement with Ridley Scott's vision of what this movie &quot;should have been&quot;. When I saw the original release of Bladerunner,I felt that the voiceover narration was needed and added much clarity to the film. I saw Harrison Ford's character as a &quot;Mickey Spillane&quot; type of detective,what with his tough,grizzled,and unshavened look. The narration reminded me of the old,50's movies like &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, and &quot;The Big Easy&quot;. It created a film noirish feel to the film that set it apart from other science fiction films. And,regarding the &quot;happy ending&quot;,...so what?!I feel it was necessary to provide some type of closure to the story.Sorry,Mr.Scott,but you blew it this time! You should have left it as it was. Now, I can't even find the original theatrical release of Bladerunner-on VHS or DVD!It's as if it has been totally replaced by the director's cut.

Delavier is expert in two areas, and has brought them together in this book: First, he knows physiology.  This book isn't just a superficial treatment of which muscles are involved in an excercise; there are training tips and superb graphic representations of these muscles in action.  Second, Delavier is a master illustrator.  The illustration shown on the cover is indicative of the quality of artwork in the entire volume.  It's profusely illustrated, and the illustrations are all top-notch...every last one of them.  This book is a huge advance for weight-lifters of all types.  Get the book before it's gone.  My personal opinion is that it's destined to be a classic.
B00005U2JL|5.0|I was at this show at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Downtown L.A. and it was awesome, I also saw manson on the GGG tour at the Universal Ampitheater earlier that year in January, I personally thought the Universal Ampitheater show was much better, but this was still great...<br />Look for a guy wear a shirt with a cross and an S P on it, thats me...
B000002JSN|5.0|In every way and in every respect, Physical Graffiti is a bonafide classic. Released at the peak of Zeppelin's reign as rock superstars, Graffiti showcases the band at their most diverse and inspired. Featured here are the well known tracks Ten Years Gone, Custard Pie, Trampled Under Foot, and Kashmir, one of Zeppelin's greatest. The band shows many different sounds, from Eastern influence to folk to west coast rock, all of which flow together incredibly well.  What really makes this album great for me is the other, lesser known tracks. The greatest of these is In My Time of Dying, a blistering 11 minute rocker that is truly one of rock's greatest songs. Rounding out the notable tracks are In the Light, Down By the Seaside, and The Wanton Song, but really every track is worth listening to. Words fail to describe my love for this album, so I'll just say it gets my vote as the greatest rock album of all time. It's a timeless album and 82 wonderful minutes that will never get old, at least with me.
B00004RF9B|2.0|Cannot say anything bad about the movie itself -- a must-see to understand how derivative many later SF movies were.<br />But my main gripe is with the DVD itself: the film print from which it was made was so dinged up and scratched that it really detracts from the enjoyment. The sound track is garbled in a few spots as well. There are some choppy edits that may be either missing footage in this print, or maybe poor choices made for the theatrical release; hard to tell.<br />Finally, there appeared on at least one occasion those telltale circles scratched on the film by some[one]  to alert the projectionist of the coming projector/reel switch.<br />I had the oddest sensation, like that of watching a crummy 16-mm print in a high school auditorium.<br />Evidently Turner rushed this DVD to market without caring to spend the millions necessary to do a full restoration. One hopes that in some dark vault of the MGM archives lurks a cleaner print, so that they will one day reissue this fine classic film in a DVD edition worth owning.<br />But judging from the other DVD reviews, there are evidently two DVD editions extant: the crummy one I and a some others have seen, and a supposedly superb/flawless one, now out of print. Why is only the bad one in circulation? ...
B00005BL2A|3.0|Well... I bought depeche mode cd today, didn't know if it will be good or not, i've never been a fan so I took a chance.  What a good surprise when i listen to it.  I must admit that the first time I wasn't sure if I love it or not.  I listen to it a second time and then, I said to myself what a great album!!  Songs like Freelove, Comatose, The Dead of Night are my personal fav!  A great variation of sound, it's not always the same beat from beginning 'til the end and best thing among all it's not commercial, well.. i'm loving pop but sometimes it's great to listen to something you don't hear on radio or TV.  I gave 3 stars just because I think that voice of David is on second plan, they put music in front so I think it a lack from this cd.<br />Good Album to add to your collection, you won't be disappointed!
B00000DFMM|5.0|The preceding reviews are terrific testament to this incredible record. It's frantic, sweeping, well-oiled and surprising. &quot;Dr. Mabuse&quot; may be one of the 10 best single tracks of the decade...an ambitious song and production that succeeds in all it attempts. Claudia's voice is heart breaking.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones' voice truly is one of a kind.  The kind that makes little hairs on the back of your neck stand on end, as if they are at attention and listening too.  It truly is a wonderful lesson to listen to her album straight through.  It reminds me to be aware of the authenticity and beauty that should be present in one form or another whenever you listen to music.  Especially, when the sounds on your stereo are as valuable as Miss Jones'. <BR>    favorite track: shoot the moon(6)
B00005RFAI|5.0|What else can I say, this should have been album of the year for 2001. it makes you feel like pink is sharing all her feelings with you and being honest. she is a great singer and i wish her the best on her third album since she is so new. I know shell do it.
6303522440|5.0|One of Fellini's best, most winning films.  Uncle Teo is Everyman.

6302820448|5.0|Watch this film in a double with State and Main.  They share a theme, and a lot of very funny material.  GD is wry.  Irritating the first time through, I realized that it was meant to be.  That's the way life can seem when you don't see any difference from one day to the next -- when you don't learn anything.  Great film.
B000062TU1|3.0|The Harry Potter movie is not as good as the book.  Daniel Radcliffe plays a good Harry Potter, but he's too cute to be as dorky as Harry Potter is supposed to be!  Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) is well-played and she suits the part.  Rupert Grint does an amazing job as Ron Weasley, looking and acting the part perfectly.  Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid) also looks and acts the part well.  Most of the characters are well-played, but the book is something else and the movie is something else.  You just can't get the magic of the book with the movie.  My advice is see it once at the movie theatre, but don't buy the DVD.  Watch it for Harry's sake only.
B00005QK3W|4.0|No doubt about it.  McCartney still has chops to write interesting songs that warrant repeated listening.  Without knowing the man, it's hard to say why his last three albums have brought so much freshness to his music, something that IMHO has been missing for quite a while.  This album rates along with some of his best work.
0465011012|5.0|Back in graduate school now, my professor, a world-renowned international developmentalist, asked me to write a paper discussing how economic development changed the culture of Korea.  My search for books that may give me \\"clues\\" to what current culture is like in North Korea led me to this book.  North Korea is where my grand parents are from and where both my parents were born.  My parents are both 61 years old.  My grand parents left North Korea in 1953 and my parents left Korea in the in the early 1970s.  If it weren't for my ancestors, I may have lived my life in Pyongyang instead of the previledged life I lead in the West.<br />I am no culturalist but North Korea, as a corrupted Stalinist  cum cultist state is now very much different from South Korea.  In South Korea, previledged rich kids drive their own automobiles whereas in North Korea, the fields are tilled by ox-drawn carts.  In South Korea, bottles of Western scotch is drunk in night clubs where tabs come up to hundreds of dollars a pop and designer wears are de rigour with young college kids who indulge in decadences such as elective plastic surgery.  In North Korea, hundreds of thousands of kids are stunted from malnourishment.  I can't think of two more diametric cultures that could have emerged amongest one group of people: abject poverty and outrageous decandence.  I am not judging South Korea nor am sympathetic to the North, I am just pointing out the stark differences.  Anyway, if you want to know more about North Korea, this is a first-person account of someone who lived in a Korean gulag from the 1980s to the 1990s.  The person who lived this life, Kang Chol-Hwan, is only about 34 years old in 2002.<br />To recap: In 2002, there are two Koreas, one the 7th largest economy in the world, the other where 2 to 3 million people are reported to have died of famine during 1995 to 1999: that's 10 percent of the population of North Korea.  To wit, now there are two Koreas with two cultures.  50 years ofseparation and experiements in autarky vs. free-market economics (albeit, an Asian version) is the cause.<br />This book gave me a first-hand account of what life is like in North Korea.  It is reader friendly and informative.  Along with USAID (US International Agency for Development) Director Andrew S. Natsios book called \\"The Great North Korean Famine,\\" I got a some ideas about what is happening in North Korea in the late 1990s to the present.  <br />A good read if you are interested in what life is like for some North Koreans.
B000060OFT|5.0|I loved this movie.  I'm a big fan of Shakespeare anyway, and I usually hate remakes set in the present, because you lose the meaning, but this movie was so supremely awsome!  The director, Baz Luhrman, was able to capture the spirit of the story while setting it in present day California.  The way they portrayed the narrator was perfect.  It was incredible how Baz was able to add even more drama, and at the same time comedy, to this wonderful Shakespearean tale.  I know I've used many adjectives in this review, but this is exactly how I feel about how well this movie did justice to what it was given, the greatest love story ever written.
B000001IPL|5.0|This is my favorite punk rock cd ever made. I don't think it can get better than this. This is easily Offspring's best work, yes some people will tell you that the earlier cds (self-titled and ignition) are better but they are missing something that smash has.<br />This album is fast paced, and in your face punk. Dexter had excellent songwriting and the other members did an excellent job with the instruments.<br />This was the cd that brought offspring into fame, it was their breakthrough album, much like metallica's black album. <br />i will give a rundown on the tracks:<br />1) Time to relaxe-this is just an introduction, a pretty good one at that, most intro's i don't usually like much but this one is cool<BR>7/10<br />2) Nitro(youth energy)-This song is fast, and very catchy, i especially like the drumming on this song. <BR>9/10<br />3) Bad Habit-In this song dexter sings about road rage, talking about taking his gun out of his glove box etc.. This one was my fav a long time ago when i first got the cd. Maybe its because I felt rebellious when i heard the string of cussing 3/4 through the song, im not sure. This is still one of my favorites, and it still reminds me of my very first listen to this cd back in 1994.<BR>10/10<br />4) gotta get away- now this song has a pretty cool bassline, thats what the songs opens with. i do not like this song quite as much as the others on the cd, but its still pretty good. However the chorus is excellent, which makes the song much better than it normally would be<BR>7/10<br />5) genocide-Donkey Kong! This song rules, the guitar riffs have a really cool sound, and once again in this song i really love the chorus. Very catchy just like the rest of the cd. 1234 Donkey Kong!<BR>9/10<br />6) something to beleive in-this one is alright but seems kinda flat and boring. i would say this is the worst song on the cd. its not that bad but the chorus just repeats the same line and its just lacking a bit<BR>6/10<br />7)come out and play-allhail the egyptian music!! This song really owns, its catchy, it sounds really cool and its something everyone loves. This is one of the more popular songs of the cd. Dexter's singing is top notch. I love this song.<BR>10/10<br /> self esteem-everyone knows this song, i shouldn't have to explain it. its a slower paced song, singing about his low self-esteem and how his girlfriend is always cheating on him. This song was well done, and is a classic.<BR>10/10<br />9) it'll be a long time-this song kicks off nice and fast after self esteem, another great song.although quite short.<BR>10/10<br />10) killboy powerhead-this song was not written by the offspring. i beleive it was written by some female band, as it says in the credits. Anyway its easily one of the best on the cd. <BR>10/10<br />11)what happened to you-i used to think this song was about his friend becoming gay. now i realize its about his friend doing to much pot and other drugs. its not a bad song but not one of the best either. <BR>7/10<br />12) so alone-this song ends faster then it starts, its pretty cool, just some random screaming and swearing but it ends before your ready<BR>8/10<br />13) not the one-i don't really like this one. not sure why but i just don't.<BR>5/10<br />14) smash-Best song on the CD!!! This is my favorite offspring song. its fast and catchy and it has everything. Download this song if you haven't heard it. This song really gets me pumped up. the perfect ending to a near perfect cd
0800177177|3.0|Yeah...it was alright.  It wasn't really special.  Mostly, it is worth watching if you like vampire movies.  But if you, like me, have read the book, you will be disappointed by this.  Sure, it is a pretty acurate translation of the book to the screen.  But when the movie becomes halfway through, it goes sour.  Gary Oldman was a TERRIFIC Dracula; before he went 'young'.  He did that in the book, but he suposedly looked about 59, not 27.  The story was a close translation; until the studio execs decided to add in that trash about Dracula having a lova affair with Mina.  That was a complete \\"OH, FOR THE LOVE OF...!!!!\\" moment.  Also, the scenes on the ship are some of the scariest...in the book.  In the movie, it is taken down to about 6 seconds of screen-time.  Pathetic.  I guess I will close here with my final word:  Not bad, but could have been better.  Characters were dull, story was painfull.  Direction was good, but there was nothing good TO DIRECT.  Nice try, though.  Coppola, you did good on 'The Godfather', but you falter here.
B000002H33|5.0|Easily one of the best thrash albums of all time, Metallica comes out blazing. This album gives a fast paced energy and also has some amazing slower songs. Master Of Puppets is only rivaled by Ride The Lightning and Kill em when comparing it to the rest of Metallica's lineup. ...And justice for all takes a slight, but very interesting turn but remains very heavy.<br />The Music:<br />1) Battery- The intro is fantastic, starting the song with great acoustic guitars, then turning into the fast aggresion that is Battery. This song is fast, and the solo's are mind blowing. One of the best songs Metallica's ever done.<BR>10/10<br />2) Master Of Puppets- The title track, this song has great lyrics, and i just love the title of the song and cd. After the main part of the song, halfway through, Hammet goes through a slow solo that was written very well, then it gets heavier again and goes into an incredible fast solo. The song then continues where it left off and finishes with a strange clown sounding laugh.<BR>10/10<br />3) The Thing That Should Not Be- This song has a slower pace, and a some very cool sounding riffs. Hetfield also uses a bit of a strange voice. My only complaint is the song gets repetitive. The solo is one of my favorites by Hammet in this song. Sounds really dark and twisted. <BR>9/10<br />4) Welcome Home (Sanitarium)- My favorite Metallica song. Starts off slow and builds from there. This song was written to absolute perfection. Perfect lyrics, perfect everything.<br />11/10<br />5) Disposable Heroes- The cd changes quite a bit with this song. Goes back to a faster pace, and gets more thrashy. Although i think the lyrics took a turn for the worse with this song. I don't like them for some reason. <BR>8/10<br />6) Leper Messiah- I love the riffs in this song. This is a great song, it'll keep your head bobbing.<BR>9/10<br />7) Orion- This is a good instrumental but Metallica has better. I prefer Call of the Ktulu and Pulling Teeth over this one by a longshot. Actually I like Dream Theater's cover of this song better then Metallica's.<BR>7/10<br />8) Damage Inc.- Starts off slow, but then it gets fast. This is a major pump up song. What a perfect way to end this album.<br />Well easily one of Metallica's best. I only like ride the lightning better than this one. If your a fan of thrash metal, its your duty to own this CD.
B000060MMI|5.0|This cd is Definetely a great sequel to a great album, swagger....The best songs are drunken lullabies, the son never shines.....U NEED TO BUY THIS CD....FLOGGING MOLLY IS AWESOME
B00000JGOJ|5.0|The cover of this DVD makes this movie seem like some all time comedy. It is however a movie of all sorts of emotions we see in daily life. The rich cast is just too much for a movie lover to handle and each of them have performed FANTASTIC roles. I initially picked this movie for Sean Connery, Angelina Jolie and Gillian Anderson. After watching the movie, I felt like the entire cast, the director, producer and the story writer... each deserve their own credits. Some one liners made me laugh and some scenes just made me want to pause the movie and shed a tear or two. Just see it for yourself. Telling you or describing any part of the movie is to spoil your moment of SHEER ENTERTAINMENT. Dont dont (and I repeat dont) miss this movie if you have a chance to see it.
B0000399WI|5.0|How does a Stephen King novel come to be one of the best films of recent time , if not one of the best five of all time . I have seen this film inumerable times and am still completely blown away by it each time I see it, I used to think it was the source novel that made it the film that it was though on numerous viewings I can now say that it is one of those rare occassions that the sum of the parts far excels the core components. <br />Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne is one of those seminal acts of Hollywood casting that in years to come will be discovered to be probably fourth or fifth on the list behind the Hollywood big guns but which will be later be shown as the saving grace for the film ( much like a young carpenter named Harrison Ford in Star Wars) This is his moment and why he didn't win an Oscar for this role will be lamented in years to come.<br />If you are looking for a film that inspires ,then this is for you but it goes so much further than just inspiring . To me it is a sign that when Hollywood wants to it can make a near three hour movie that has substance , the greatest acting seen in a complete cast for some time and a great story that hooks you in and makes you feel for the characters in a way that  harks back to the great times of Movie making and it shows up all the inadequacies that are evident in modern film making. It is no Die Hard third installment, no X-men , no no brainer but a deeply engaging movie that for once makes you care what happens to those people on the screen
B00001ODHJ|4.0|I will tell you what. When I got finished with watching \\"Army of Darkness\\" I was totally blown away at how much different this was than \\"The Evil Dead\\". It is about the guy who lived through the first 2 Evil Deads getting sucked into the past through the  Famous Book of the Dead. Millions of years back. I won't give any more away in case you wanted to see this flim. Just know that it is not as scary as the \\"Evil Dead\\", but rather a hunderd times sillier than the first \\"Evil Dead\\". It also makes fun of a lot of stuff.<BR>\\"Army of Darkness\\" also has one of the cheesist screenplays known to mankind. One can either hold it aginst the movie, along with bad acting, and cheep special effects(and trust me, the long list things gose on) and say the movie really [stunk].<BR>The other option is to look at it the way I did and say it was supposed to be dumb, but at leats it entertained, and I though is was very funny. Bottom line is if you can just let loose and injoy really wackey things, then this is a must see.
B00003CXRM|5.0|O brother where art thou , what can I say , could this be a sign that mainstream America is starting to grasp onto the ideals of European film making. The Coens have surpassed themselves with this film , though Fargo and Blood Simple are both excellent.The Coens have grasped the fact that what makes movies great and will make them be remembered in the future is not special efects and CGI but good old fashioned storytelling and great dialogue .Ok they claim to have gotten inspiration from Homers Odyssey and who am I to disagree , not being a Greek scholar? But what they have created is believable characters that you truely feel for even knowing they are criminals and that by the end of the film they are the ones you are rooting for, how rare is that in modern Hollywood. The Coens still seem determined to make movies that push the boundries of what is classed as mainstream Hollywood. George Clooney does more in this movie to redeem himself from Batman and Robin than I have known any actor to have ever done before , plus I love his homage to James Stewart. A  stunningly clever rediscovery and use of old American music makes this movie a must in the top ten films ever made
B000059MEK|5.0|where do i start? this is my first daft punk CD. i'm astounded by its beats. i've had it for about 2 days now and have been listening to it since i got it in the mail. &quot;harder, better faster, stronger&quot;, &quot;digital love&quot;, &quot;aerodynamic&quot;, &quot;one more time&quot;, and &quot;short circuit&quot; are the best tracks on the whole thing....then again...the whole CD is G-R-E-A-T! i've been dancing around in my seat and in my house all day long. i totally recommend this to anyone who loves to dance. it'll make the non-dancer get up and dance. it's that damn good{=o)
B000060K4O|1.0|Ghostbusters is a great flick, but Columbia-TriStar Home Video has apparently sent-out production-flawed units titled - \\"Ghostbusters Collector's Series DVD\\". After purchasing one at a [local] store in my area, I went straight home and inserted it in my player and popped some corn. All was fine until the movie got to Chapter-15 whereby the video portion of the movie froze-up solid - like it was paused or something - as the audio continued to move forward in a jerky, cartoon-like fashion. I stopped the movie to observe the disk under better lighting and it was fine - at least it appeared so. I reloaded the disk and tried several attempts to access Chapter-15 and beyond, all without success. By that point, I was beginning to think my 3-month old Panasonic changer was flipping out. I loaded a different movie in the player - no problem. I carried the Ghostbusters disk to my DVD capable PC and experienced the same symptoms on it as well. The next day, I returned the movie to [the local store] and exchanged it for another. Surely, the first disk was just bad - right? I tried the second DVD at home and it turned-out to be the same as the first - BAD, and with the exact symptoms as the first. It looks as though I'll have to make yet another trip to [the local store] so as to collect my refund. After a little research on the Web, I found that many were having the same problems with this title. ... Beware of this disk, and hang-on to your receipt if you decide to try one yourself!!
B00003CXZ4|2.0|Well, I just saw what everyone was saying should win the Oscar for best picture.  I thought it was going that way for the first twenty minutes or so of the film.  It sure did keep me wondering and riveted.  However, like a lot of movies tackling complex themes and ideas, it had to resort to a trainwreck of an ending...Suddenly, from suspense to psychological, it takes a turn for the philosophical.  It's not as bad as Vanilla Sky, but you get the feeling they're in the same new genre--the I-Can-Do-Anything-With-This-Movie-And-Come-Out-Original genre.  I had more questions than answers after the movie ended which that explanation just didn't solve.  Too bad,  I really wanted to like it...go watch Insomnia for real psychological suspense and thrills--no, not the remake from Memento's director, Christopher Nolan, but the original by Erik Skjoldbjaerg.  (Now, let's see short term memory deal with that name.)
6303168507|5.0|This is one of the best films ever made. I have never been so engrossed in a film as this one. Liam Neeson play's Oscar Schindler a nazi, and buisiness man. He is happy about the war becouse it make's him money. He is a selfish, greedy man who care's only about money. In the beginning. He enlists the help (slave labor) of Itzhak Stern played by the brilliant Ben Kingsley, to help him get his plant of field kits going for the war. However after Amon Goeth played by Ralph Fiennes shows up and cleans out a jewish housing project Schindler can not stand back, and he becomes a real hero in a time and place where they were in short supply.<BR>The acting in this movie is first rate. Neeson,Fiennes,Embeth Davidtz and Kingsley are at there best. Spielberg is at top form. This is a long movie but worth the watch. If at the end when Oskar tell's Stern that he could have gotten more you'r heart does not break it never will. This is a movie about triumph in the mose dire of conditions.
B00005JKED|5.0|Training Day was as i expected a great film! Not only did this movie suprise me, it shocked me especially when i noticed that Denzel washington played a ruthless backstabing cop that would do anything to be on top! it's a great film with a great cast and the story was unbelievable especially when you start taking Denzel side after he give this speech about living in the real world. The only thing i have to say is A MOST HAVE!!!!
B000031XCR|4.0|It's basically a greatest hits cd + several awesome new songs.<br />This album is great to relax to.  Celine has a very beautiful and soothing, yet powerful voice, and she displays her talent openly on this cd.  Listening to it is almost like reliving the first 10 years of Celine's career.<br />I am amazed at how she is able to just tell the story in each song, which is something that many of the newer artists are not able to do.  You can tell she means what she is singing in each song, and that makes each song more meaningful.<br />One unfortunate absence from this CD is her duet with Andrea Bocelli on the song &quot;The Prayer&quot;.  I had hoped that it was on this CD, but it wasn't.<br />The newer songs for Celine that are on this album are:  'That's the Way It Is', 'If Walls Could Talk', 'The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face', 'All the Way', 'Then You Look at Me', 'I Want You to Need Me', and 'Live'.  All of these 'new' songs are wonderful.  I especially like 'Then You Look at Me'.  It's just absolutely beautiful and pure.  Anyone can probably relate to the lyrics of this song and enjoy the beauty of it.  (It was written by Jennings and Horner, the dynamic duo behind 'My Heart Will Go On', so it's a song that would probably be Oscar-worthy except it wasn't part of a movie.)<br />Definitely get this album, especially if you are a Celine fan.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|Zoolander was not a great movie and not a horrible movie, it was more in between. This film could have been much better but lacked mostly on the story and as it came closer to the end it got more ridiculouse and stupid, as in stupid not funny. They could have also gotten a better looking guy to play the role of Owen Wilson since, I don't want to be mean, his nose is pointed more to the left side then straight... and that made his role not beievable! Other than these lacking parts the film was ok!! It had an outstanding cast of appearences and had some jokes in it that made you wonder what was going through Ben Stillers mined while he was making this film, since the jokes were out right hilariouse! The role that Will Ferrel played was also out right hilariouse, just by the facial reactions of Will made me burst out laughing! If your a Ben Stiller fan deffinitley add this movie to your collection, if your more like a &quot;I like Ben&quot; then rent it first and then decide wheter you want to buy it!!
0783107986|5.0|Undoubtedly the very best documentary on World War II. It includes an unbiased report from all points of view. Praise being given where due regardless of warring faction. This series leads the viewer chronologically through this enormous conflict with the most engaging narration. I think that there exists no better general overview than The World At War.
B000062Y98|5.0|I've been a fan of Blind Guardian for about 2 years now and I can't even describe how they have change the way I listen and play music. I got a lot of people in my area into Blind Guardian and bands with simular style. Their new album is by far the most complex I ever heard. Though I am getting to miss their older style of music, I will always love their music and will always be loyal to them. If you havn't got this album yet, ... Get it now!!!!
0446608955|5.0|This book is by far the most interesting book of all. It tells the tale of then 57-year-old Landon Carter in 1999. In the prologue, he revives the memory of being 17, the most meaningful year of his life. <BR>It was this year when he met Jamie Sullivan, the quiet, goody-two-shoes and always wearing her hair in a bun. She was the daughter of a Southern Baptist Minister who was constantly teased by Landon and his friends, the cool kids in school who eat boiled peanuts in graveyards. Hegbert Sullivan also wrote plays. Landon joined the Drama Club in school instead of Chemistry for ease and pleasure, not by reciting lines but sleeping. When Jamie was needless to say, made the angel, she was to stand in front of the class and Landon found a slightly more attractive her than usual. He didn't give much thought about it, until he was forced to ask Jamie to accompany him for the homecoming dance. That was better than cleaning up puke, right?<BR>After the dance, Jamie asked Landon to do her a favor by playing Tom, the lead role of the play besides the angel. He excepted it, touched by Jamie's emotions. Thus came the session to walk her home. His love for Jamie developed when her role of the angel came out, when she let her honey-blonde hair down, wore a beautiful dress and a touch of make-up, making the sight of her arresting. After the play, he wished that, for the first time, he could walk her home.<BR>Thus came the unusual and unexpected relationship they had. He first started bringing her to his house and then to classy diners.<BR>But Sparks say that every good thing comes to an end. Jamie had a secret kept long in her heart, and when she finally told Landon about a battle she had been fighting, all emotions came in. How the relationship Landon and his father built up, how Jamie changed everybody's life in her town, and how Landon's love can bring great joy to Jamie while she fights on.<br />This book is very educational, with a lot of Christian beliefs and good deeds. Italso has a touch of humor and very very sad parts which will leave most of you tearing. I recommend this book to everybody who wants a good book to read and is capable of curling in his or her room (I'm sure you wouldn't want others to see you cry over a book). This book was recommended to me by other Mandy Moore fans who've read it (after we knew that Mandy would be acting the lead role with Shane). I've never regretted buying and I still enjoy it,
B00005JKCF|5.0|...with the absolutely perfect translation of Spider-Man's fluidity of motion and poses from the comic to the live-action screen. Examine the shots of him leaping from the side of a building, casting a web-line onto a cornice, whipping through the concrete canyons, soft-landing upside down under a lintel--perfect! You can imagine King Kirby's artwork as snapshots from these sequences. This really IS the comic come to life, and I have to say, \\"Well done, ladies and gentlemen!\\" They really did pull it off and I'm still amazed.<br />Toby Maguire, Willem Dafoe...big names, yes, but also big acting talent. That bodes well; you can add CG, costumes, FX to an imperfectly-cast actor and come out okay, but no amount of bells and whistles can make up for bad acting (George Clooney as Batman? Oh please...)<br />I don't know the plot (other than the broadest outlines of the origin story--I'd rather be surprised). But come May 3rd, I'll believe that a guy with the proportional strength and speed of a spider could become your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.<br />It's wonderful when you see a beloved childhood icon treated with care and fondness, and very painful when the producers take a cavalier attitude toward the subject. I haven't read the comics for years, but Batman and Spider-Man and other great genre heroes became part of my childhood mythology. I love dipping into that nostalgic well, and I hate seeing those memories sullied (Kevin Kostner as Robin Hood...I rest my case.)<br />Let's hope they can pull it off for 120 minutes. Excelsior!
B00000739S|3.0|The best thing about this album is the songs, undoubtedly, 6 of Reed's biggest. But listening to it one can only be glad that Reed didn't make it big before 'Transformer' if that's how his songs might have sounded like. In the versions they receive on this album, none of these 6 songs would have lasted 30 years and surely more. It's great (if you're a reed fan) to hear a completely different version to the original one, but a big rock'n'roll band with flashy full-distortion guitar solos that makes the song much- much longer, makes Reed songs sound funny, was he actually on stage with this band? It truly sounds somewhere between cover versions performed by a typical 70's Hard rock band and Reed's self-mockery show. Never mind though, it's gives a good comparison indicator between what was popular at the time and what Reed chose to do in the studio. This album proves beyond any reasonable doubt that Reed's studio decisions, won. I'd recommend this album to all the Heavy metal / rhythm and blues / prog rock lovers of the 70's that usually can't stand and maybe understand Reed's material. This is for you heavy metal thunders!!!
B00000K3UR|4.0|This is a very entertaining movie. The irresponsible Sonny Koufax tries to impress his girlfriend by &quot;pretending&quot; to adopt a little boy. The girlfriend isn't convinced, but Sonny starts to form a tight bond with the kid and ends up wanting to adopt him for real. I do admit that the humor in this movie did go a little too far at times. Like, Sonny DID set a pretty bad example to this 5-year-old boy. Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean. As an adult, you would think that Sonny should be a little more responsible...but there is hope, because Sonny later shapes things up and becomes a much better role model for the child. So, it is possible to argue that the humor in this film is a little wrong, but it does change. &quot;Big Daddy&quot; DOES have a story to tell and a good lesson to share. I think you will like it.
B00005R2M3|5.0|A well done Pop album.<br />As much as I love my techno, or love my rock, I hold a soft-spot<br />for pop.  Shakira not only has some great songs, but she has some<br />of those great songs in Spanish, which I happen to like.<br />Her music has great rhythm and is something that anyone can dance<br />to.  It's only kind of sad that this was the first real big hit<br />of all her CDs on these shores.  She's got a great voice and an<br />outstanding selection of different types of music to show off her<br />ability to sing.<br />I recommend this to anyone who enjoys pop, especially pop from a<br />different country, like the Spice Girls before Geri Halliwell had<br />left the band.<br />~bgmdragon
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I recomend this Oscar winning movie to everyone.
B00003CXI1|4.0|While I will grant you that the movie seemed a little rushed I thought they did a great job on it.  The children were cast perfectly.  I saw it twice in theatres and I liked the movie better the second time.  It's very difficult to translate a movie into a book but I thought they did an excellent job.  While I wish it were longer, what can you do.  I just hoping for a director's cut to come out on DVD...  The quidditch match was SO COOL!!!!!<BR>Harry Potter rocks.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Just skip tracks 7 and 11, and you'll be fine.  This cd rocks.  Hard.
0800121260|4.0|Very few actors can play Idiots or losers like Hoffman does in this movie. He does it with so much grace that you want to adopt him. Maybe not fully intended, but it's a brilliant comedy. Hoffman's indifference while trying to open the door of the plane is, in my opinion, one of the funniest scenes in cinema ever.
0780622553|5.0|Before there was the Matrix...<br />Dark City is one of the most outstanding movies.  Which can be<BR>debated whether or not it fits film material--but for the sake<BR>of swiftness, we'll call it a movie.  Dark City has great style<BR>and great story written up and down it's walls surely as there<BR>was blood and creepy spirals.<br />For those who saw the Matrix and felt it was the best movie of<BR>that type, I'm sorry to say that Dark City exists.  As deep-<BR>down philosophical that people thought the Matrix was, Dark City<BR>has already been there and done that.  You can see the heavy<BR>influence that Dark City had for the creators of the Matrix.<BR>Of course, you could draw a lot of inspiration from films like<BR>&quot;the Children of the Lost City&quot; in Dark City but they're still<BR>very different in many ways.<br />And if you were looking for a good modern movie that has that<BR>Noir setting, I'd have to recommomend &quot;Dark City&quot;.  Not only<BR>rich in plot, great visuals, and very stylish, but you've got<br />space aliens!  How much better could you get than that?<br />~bgmdragon
0679736646|5.0|Ubik is the best sci fi book I've ever read. I've read Sci Fi all my life, but usually stick with the short stories. I get bogged down in the first chapter or two of novels, boring, but not this one. But I just finished reading this book for the second time. The first time I read it was ten years ago, I remember well, Cause it was about 100 degrees out here in Texas &amp; I was laying in the sun... This story gave me chills &amp; goosebumps! So many twists &amp; turns, truely soul shocking! This evening I found it again, and as I started reading again, I had the same experiece, I couldn't put the book down. It's now 6 am.<BR>Well, to me that's a great Friday night!
0784011710|4.0|...if you read the book before watching the movie - as I did - you may find yourself a little disappointed, or perhaps a little frustrated with the absence of some details that were left out in the movie. Yes, Pakula did his homework and kept it very loyal to Styron's masterpiece. And yes, the cast is really superb. It is understandable how hard it must have been to squeeze such a powerful and descriptive story into a 150 min. film, so after all it is worth buying this DVD. The special features are also great.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is, without a doubt, Radiohead's best album.

0596000480|5.0|It seems in the whole web development process I keep coming back to this book for answers. Absolutely essential for any cross-browser javascript that needs to be written as well as cross-browser comparisons. I can't write javascript without it!! If I could give it 6 stars I would for one reason, the coverage of regexp!!!! The absolute heart of PERL and the best thing to hit earth for string manipulations. Go get it now!!!

0789302691|4.0|I like Pearl Jam. Really.<br />And I like this book. Really.<br />It's just that ... well ... let me be honest here: great photography, interesting camera angles, and the B&W/color shifts are stellar and create a lasting effect; I just wish that once --just once -- the focus could shift to the viewpoint(s) of every OTHER member of the band besides Ed Vedder (the only time you really see it is in the photos of the fans -- for that, the book loses a star. Sorry, folks!). Maybe a sequel would be nice -- call it \\"Those OTHER Guys\\" and make them the subject matter. <br />Still, this is a book worth having. Very recommended.
B00005U1YO|5.0|All you have to do is skip track 7 and 10, which are the two vocal collaborations.  The lyrics on these tracks aren't very impressive, and they just mess up the flow of an otherwise superb cd.  The music is very impressive, I even enjoy listening to it with the volume down low.  Intense psychedelic beats, good stuff.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies ever made.The plot and action was great,but it's sad to watch.

0399134204|5.0|I'm the president of a book club, and I chose this book partly to appease my female members.  The book started out slowly and the simple English was somewhat boring, but once the story began and the characters were fully introduced, I couldn't put it down.  This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read.  It teaches us about the Chinese and their mother-daughter relationships, but also helps us understand our own parents and children.  The novel is written in a mix between narrative and myth, which makes it all the more intriguing and enjoyable.
B000059MEK|5.0|Few records are as fun as this one.  Strong the whole way through.

6305165912|5.0|The Big Lebowski is the first Coen brothers film I saw, and I must say I'm surprised that so many people don't seem to like their style. If TBL is indicative of the rest of their movies, they must all be works of strange genius. <BR>TBL is a hilarious movie, though an eccentric one at that. It's the only film I know that has a record number of F words in a single film, and is yet still tasteful.<BR>The characters are very well defined and the actors play them convincingly. And if you like 'The Peppers, you'll also be amused by Flea's performance as the wussy nihilist. <BR>Overall, TBL is an excellent movie, and something for just about anyone's collection. Even if you're not interested in buying it, I'd recommend you to at least rent it and see it. I guarantee you'll be hooked.
B00003CX5P|5.0|One of the biggest complaints against this movie has been its &quot;terrible script&quot; and predictable plot.  Because the other three Star Wars movies have been accepted into the canon of classic pictures, we have a tendency to judge this movie a little more harshly than we should.<br />The first three movies produced, in my opinion, were, at times, corny and predictable as well, but I still liked them a lot.  The music in this movie was amazing (I don't know where John Williams continues to get ideas from after all these years), the casting was excellent, and the story was somewhat intriguing.  I'm eagerly awaiting the releases of the next two, just to see how everything worked out between Episode I and Episode IV.<br />There was, however, one huge mistake in this movie: Jar Jar Binks.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie was great and touching.The cast and plot was great.I love the music and everything else.
0780619951|3.0|I've never seen such a strange, bizarre, and unique movie. However, I watch this every time it's on TV, and enjoy the DVD. Something keeps me coming back, and watching this over and over. Why? If anything, the performance of Val Kilmer alone should turn anyone off to this movie - he flips between sanity and insanity.<br />Whatever reviews you see, good or bad, forget them - rent this movie, and form your own opinion. It's really something that everyone will see differently. The majority will find it too bizarre, but it's worth the risk.<br />You could also draw upon a number of themes:<br />- The raw behavior inside humanity<br />- The dangers of playing God<br />- Existence is Suffering<br />- Instincts<br />Just take a chance.
B0000062GE|5.0|Another great album by one of the most underappreciated bands in music! I hate to disagree with D. Greenwood, but I will take as much music as a band can give me on a CD; it's called practical, a bargain, and economical. I can understand if the extra material stinks, but I can't see what could be cut out to make this better. Of course, maybe some of you only have a 40 minute attention span. Thank God CDs are longer than the 28 to 32 minute albums that used to come out!<br />There's nothing here that isn't worth having on a CD. Once again, Stabbing Westward has compiled a great album that program directors must be afraid to play. There are a multitude of great songs by these angst driven, depressed, metal heads. Yeah, I'm willing to call this hard rock even with the keyboards. I have an imagination and rules suck! This Cd has an edge that is unbelievable and makes it near impossible to stop listening until the disc is finished; that's right, all of it!<br />There is no end to good songs here; \\"Everything I Touch\\", \\"How Can I Hold On\\", \\"Torn Apart\\", \\"Haunting Me\\", and \\"Sometimes It Hurts\\". These are all nice, but there are even better songs here, in my opinion. Listen to \\"You Complete Me\\", the hit \\"Save Yourself\\", \\"Sometimes it Hurts\\", and my favorites \\"The Thing I Hate\\" and \\"Waking Up Beside You\\". Stabbing Westward takes industrial rock, hard rock, and pop to a perfect amalgamation. Buy this, while it's available and very affordable.
B00005NWM3|4.0|I pretty much would gave this album 3 stars for &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; alone.  I think that song is that good.  It's pretty scary when you've heard a song continuously for months, and you're still not sick of it yet.  The newest single &quot;Too Bad&quot; is also very good, but it doesn't compare to &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;.  The rest of the stuff on here isn't bad, I just don't think it's good.  I'm more of a rap/r&amp;b kind of guy, so part of that is just my personal taste.  If you are a rock fan (in particular Staind) you should DEFINITELY BUY THIS ALBUM.  If you are just a casual rock fan or if you just like the song &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, I would reconsider buying this album or just by the single.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is the best movie I have ever seen in my life.The plot is wonderful and I cried at the emotional scenes.
B00005ASHM|3.0|A earlier poster raised this question, &quot;I can't believe I had not heard of this phenomenal record until perhaps a decade ago. (Then again, it wasn't a certified million seller until April 2000, so I've read.) How was it possible?&quot;<br />Here's the answer, prior to the release of this album, the Beach Boys released an album called Beach Boys Party! It has to be one of the worst albums ever made by any professional singing group in the history of music, and was certainly the most unprofessional this group ever made.  I think for many Beach Boys fans it ended their association with the band.  I am one of many who was so turned off ill-concieved, stinkeroo Beach Boys Party! that I never bought anything else they released, and, in fact, traded off all the Beach Boy albums I had (and I had just about everything that they had done) for a bunch of Bob Dylan's. I have heard most of the songs off of Pet Sounds but I still have never bought this album because the awful memory of Beach Boys Party live was seared so into my brain I can still hear its rottenness after all these years.
B00005Y228|5.0|This is a great CD.  Kylie has a unique voice and a good ear for a hook.  It's about time someone made some good club music!  Jennifer Lopez wishes she could sound this good and self-assured.  Kylie's the real deal--no remixes needed here.  No lip synching, either. If you like good dance music, and catchy hooks, you'll love this CD.  Welcome back, Kylie--stay awhile why dontcha!
B000023VR6|5.0|I was never a great fan of Rap or Hip Hop until i heard this Album! It completely changed the way i looked at this side of Music. Still Dre is undoubtly the best song on here and having 22 tracks there are a lot of great songs to choose from.<BR>My suggestion, buy it immediatly
B00003CXTG|5.0|I wish this won a Best Picture award.I love this movie and really want to see it again and again for the beautiful plot and music.
B0000399WI|4.0|First off, this reviewer regularly rates this movie as his personal favourite of all time. Why only four stars then? Because we are asked to rate the DVD, not the movie, and the criminal lack of DVD extras for one of the best films ever made is shameful. So, film five stars, DVD three - averaging out at 4. Maths lesson over, on with the review.      Based on the Stephen King novella ' Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption ' this really has become a modern day classic. Other films have grossed more, and may have a more immediate following, but Shawshank will endure for years, and become another 'Casablanca ' loved by generations to come.       The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, sent to the maximum security prison of Shawshank for the murder of his wife and her lover. Played with an under-stated intelligence by Tim Robbins in a career defining turn, and supported by sterling performances from Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, and veteran James Whitmore. Morgan Freeman's work is particularly notable, not just for his performance ( let's face it, the man doesn't know how to give a bad one! ) but also for the fact that his is the voice of the film. His chocolate-rich tones were director Frank Darabont's choice for the voice-over of the film, as if his character Red is talking to us, and explaining the sub-text of the film. Voice overs often dont work ( Blade Runner being a prime example ) but this one does, perfectly.      Beginning at a slow pace, the film begins with the brutal de-humanising regime meted out to the 'Fresh Fish' as they begin their incarcaration in Shawshank. I remember suggesting my wife watch the film after I'd seen it, and she, being of a considerably more sensitive nature than me, found the early scenes difficult. If you too find the opening 45 minutes a tad heavy going, stick with it - the reward is worth it.       Eventually as we progress through the film, we see how Red's initial suspicion of Andy becomes a deep respect, and eventually a deep friendship, indeed it would be true to say that these two men love each other like brothers by the end. There are a few key scenes that really stick in the memory - the rooftop scene, the opera aria scene, the exam result scene - all of which enable us to begin to like these men, men we probably wouldn't have wanted in our homes before the film, but who we'd happily sit down to dinner with after.      The film's true emotional impact of course comes in the final third as we learn the truth about Andy's guilt or otherwise. True to many of King's works, there is a twist in the end which leaves us all stunned, and with a big stupid grin on our faces. The total and utter defeat of the dark forces in the film is accomplished with such applomb that you find yourself rooting for the bad guys  - the prisoners, a bunch of murderers and misfits that two hours earlier you were deeply suspicious of. Indeed the last section of the film plays almost totally without our hero, and remains almost my favourite portion of it. By this time we are crying out for the final fulfilment of our hopes for the characters. It is to Frank Darabont's eternal credit that he accomplishes this in a scene without dialogue, and a sweeping panoramic withdrawl from the characters, leaving us with not a dry eye in the house, and a feel-good glow that lasts for days.     ... while in [a local store] I noticed this man and wife trying to decide which DVD they would buy to view that evening. I pointed to Shawshank. \\"Ever seen this one?\\"  \\"No\\"  \\"Trust me\\" I said, \\"It's the best movie you've never seen.\\" He bought it, and I like to think I made that man and wife cry, laugh and smile that evening.      To conclude, Warner Bros and Castle Rock - SHAME ON YOU! This movie deserves better. The Region 2 version rocks, so get busy, re-package, and give us fans the extras this classic deserves!    P.S. The ten-year anniversary edition has righted many wrongs. The film has finally been done justice. I watched it again the other night, and again my eyes welled up at the end. Either I am a wus, or I'm right, or maybe both! Yeah, both!
0140186409|5.0|A beautiful story and history. Steinbeck writes the classic american tragity with Tom Joad as the tragic hero. Steinbeck captures the hard life of the dust-bowl migrants and his sparse writing style is refreshing and very enjoyable! I love this novel and consider it one of the best books I have ever read
0440211727|5.0|WOW, this was truly a powerful book. I couldn't stop reading it. I wanted to, even when I was crying, I just couldn't put it down. I needed to finish the story. This book tells a lot of truth of what things were like back then and still today. Blacks were not treated as fairly as they should have been. some still aren't. This book opened my eyes to relize what we as a people are doing to each other. I recomend every one read this book, maybe it will open our eyes, and relize what we have done in our past. The way we have treated others
6305313687|4.0|First things first - do not rent this movie if it's laughs you're after. This film is unrelentingly bleak, disturbing and thought provoking. It is also one of those films that once watched, will never be forgotten.<br />  Edward Norton, in an Oscar-nominated performance, is superb as the buffed, tattooed, skin-headed leader of a bunch of neo-fascist bigots in Venice California. He totally dominates the film, and gives flesh and bones to his character so well, that some of his lunatic beliefs almost begin to sound plausible. While his character may look scary, it's the fact that he is almost plausible that makes him truly scary.<br />  The scene where his character Derek Vinyard self-destructs at the dinner table while arguing with his mothers new Jewish boyfriend is agonisingly painful. And yet Norton is such a good actor that he makes his point sound reasoned, and despite ourselves we can see some logic in his rationale. There is another infamous scene where he dispatches a black victim that literally made me wince with the sheer brutality of it.<br />  Ultimately, despite himself, Derek begins to realise that a life wasted on hatred is fruitless, and he attempts to redeem himself by saving his younger brother from following his bad example. The climax of the film provides a painful and poignant denouement, and unlike many films today, does not leave us with a neatly tied-up ending, but rather with tragedy and anguish.<br />  Not easy viewing, but worthy. The message? 'Life's too short to run around angry all the time'. This film should be compulsory viewing for every young teenager of 15 years plus, despite its R rating.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movie that he has ever made. After 6 years (I think) of waiting after The Terminator, Arnold has graced us with his best movie ever. Not even Predator could match this performance he gives. Fans of the first Terminator will be shocked, surprised, but hopefully not saddended by his turn from vilian to the best on-screen hero. The director (James Cameron) does his best to try to portray Arnold as a ...hero that everyone could look up to and he even puts in a few hidden jokes that the Terminator would not normally do, like smile. The other cd is packed with cast and crew interviews and a behind the scenes look at the making of T:2 3-D. That is a great show (I have been there and been on it). All in all, if you have not seen this movie in this format, go out and buy it. P.S. there is a third movie with nothing left out. You will have to find it for yourself, the reward is great for those who find it.
1558908382|4.0|John Cusack seems incapable of doing wrong ( Con Air excepted! ) and this little gem reminds us of his great range. I became a fan of his during the early teen-comedy days of 'Better off Dead' and 'The Sure Thing', but this actor is a future Oscar-winner, just wait and see!<br />  The film follows the high school reunion dilemma of Cusack's character, Martin Blank, who has to balance his desire to return to his home town of Grosse Point and meet his old girlfriend, with his unconventional dayjob of professional hitman. Minnie Driver plays the love interest, and the other cast members provide able support - and yes, this even applies to Dan Ackroyd!<br />  The movie works so well because we like most of the characters in it! Cusack's character is obviously disfunctional, and the early scenes with his adopted psychiatrist Alan Arkin are hysterical. The scenes with his real-life sister Joan, all held over the phone, also are played mostly for laughs, as she arranges his next 'job' as if it were the most normal thing in the world. And yet at the heart of this there lies a story of unrequited love, and therin lies its soul. <br />  The violence in the film is slickly done, and not over-glamourised, apart from the action-comedy fest that is the store shoot-out scene, where the store attendant plays out his fantasy violence on a video game while behind him all hell is breaking loose for real. It also features quite possibly the most realistic martial arts fight scene ever committed to celluloid as Cusack has to fight for his life in the corridor of his old school with a rival hitman sent to kill him. Joe Pesci's imaginative use for a pen in 'Casino' is re-visited here, so be warned!<br />  However the film as a whole is more than the sum of it's parts. It features little observations of how we all change, and I'm sure anyone who has ever been to their own reunion will recognise characters in the film from their own lives. The bottom line is that the film just works, and while it was never going to be palatable enough for mainstream American viewing, it has gained a sizeable cult following both in the USA and Europe where it's dark edge is more appreciated.<br />  Intelligent, well-acted, witty, dark, and violent at times. This is a movie with an edge, and an attitude. If it could wear shades, they'd be designer Ray-Bans. Just a cool movie! Enjoy!
B00003CXI1|4.0|<<adult -- 30 something>>  I have read the first four HP books three times.  Love them.  I also love the movie.  And I also agree with a lot of the \\"LOW STAR REVIEWS\\" here on Amazon.  BUT, you have to realize that if it were to go JUST LIKE THE BOOK... the movie would have been at least 6 hours long.  I don't want to see a movie that long.  I also don't want to see three movies that cover the first book.  This movie was catered to HP fans.  I went to see the movie with two people who never read any HP stuff.  I enjoyed it more than they did.  I know that the reason I liked it better is the fact that I was familiar with HP's world. You just can't put ALL THAT DETAIL in a movie without making it too long.  This is as good as it gets.  I give 4 stars instead of 5 because Dudley was not as fat as I had imagined.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie is definitely worth 5 stars.  It is a intricately written, engaging story with no loose ends or flawed constructs.  Most of the criticisms are unjustified - the role of the doctor, for example, and the irony/realization of hopelessness he represents in that he could not help his one time friend because he,of all people, could not get the answer to the final riddle.  There is intense pain in this movie, and to me it was not a comedy.  Rather it is the story of of an indominably kind,good spirit in the midst of total horror.  Yes, most of what happened probably could not happen.  It will probably leave you very unsettled afterwards.  It did to me.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Ok, I've heard it all.  \\"I hate Jar-Jar\\", \\"There's no acting!\\", blah blah blah.<br />I was first introduced to Star Wars at the innocent age of three.  I saw Return of the Jedi in the theater and can only remember walking out of it after it was over.  I was three.  The magic of seeing that movie (and having a father who enjoyed the first three films) was that I can now say that i have seen the trilogy well over 300 times, each film.  Only because every time I watch these movies, I keep an open mind and view them as if I was three years old again, the only benefit to being older is that I can actually understand what Yoda means when he talks about the force.<br />This is exactly the same attitude I took in with me when I entered that theater to watch the latest offering from Lucas and Company.  And I loved every minute of it.  Did I complain about the acting?  No.  Why?  Because it's Star Wars, I'm not saying the acting was bad ever, but watch all four again, you'll see similarities in ALL of the acting.<br />Does Jar Jar suck?  Of course he does, but I'm too mezmerized, by the dark side of the force and one of the coolest lightsaber battles I have ever seen, to notice.<br />The quality of the Phantom Menace is something that has only been surpassed by the first three Star Wars films and the Matrix.  I've never seen anything that can do better, even with all of its apparent flaws, my heart still races when Obi-Wan busts out his lightsaber with ferocious malaise to avenge the death of his master.  And I've seen it over 100 times, 15 or so in the theater.<br />The DVD makes it even better!  The inclusion of the extra scenes, the hour and a half long documentary about just making the movie.  And it's not one of those documentaries where they explain the film.  Its literally a camera on the sidelines while they're making the film!  Fantastic.  Oh and the blooper reel had me rolling for about 5 minutes after I saw what pickup that jawa sandcrawler actually had!<br />All Ican say is I've seen the latest trailer for Attack of the Clones and I'm going to be waiting patiently for the next 8 weeks.  Because once that movie is released, all of the people who have spoken badly about Episode I will be suddenly silenced.
0385503954|5.0|Ian McEwan has sometimes seemed a writer of greater talents than the books he chooses to write allow him to express. His early work, slim, psychologically dense novels of macabre intensity, is powerful and upsetting, but one occasionally wished that he might allow his beautiful writing a wider canvas.<br />Atonement does this in spades -- it is a love story of heartbreaking intensity, rendered in luminous prose, that simultaneously forces the reader to confront how exactly one responds to fictions of &quot;heartbreaking intensity.&quot; Without a hint of ivory tower post-modernism (every bit of this story radiates a devotion to narrative and character), the novel is very much about the nature of fiction. It is as wonderful and powerful a book as I have read in recent memory.<br />Which isn't to say that McEwan has gone soft on us. Immediately upon finishing the novel I hated it, infuriated and disturbed by the final turn of events. It took a couple days of reflection to realize how much richer this made the book, and I've been pondering it ever since.<br />Atonement is a masterpiece, a richly imagined and written fiction that probes confidently into the essence of fiction, rending hearts, drawing tears, and prompting much thought and discussion in the process.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Pretentious fans and critics can throw around all the artsy-fartsy talk about this album that they want to, but it's really simple: &quot;Is This It&quot; is some nice, catchy retro rock that you can tap your foot too.  Much as I hate asking questions and answering them myself, I feel moved to do it here: is this stuff original?  NO.  Is it going to change the world?  NO.  But is it catchy in a mindless classic rock 'n' roll way?  Hell yeah.  What I don't get is this: why is it that bands like Creed and Nickelback get bashed for stealing from Pearl Jam, while the Strokes get praised for stealing from the likes of the Velvet Underground?  Apparently if you're ripping off '90's bands you're derivative, but if you're ripping off 70's bands you're retro.  Oh well.

0780624890|5.0|Lets face it.  There have been only a handful of great films that were based on Comic Books: Superman, Batman, The X-Men, ect.  With all the rest being dismal failures, usually because all involved didn't take their source material seriously enough and went in a completely different direction.  Not bothering to really understand why people truly love these characters in the first place.  These kinds of people should never be allowed to direct films derived from comic books.<br />It was the summer of 1998.  The hollywood machine was throwing out dozens of entertainment fodder for the masses to engulf.  I saw 14 film in the movie theaters that year.  Blade was the only one of them I saw twice.  Talk about a movie experience!  From the opening shots, you are literally sucked in (no pun intended) to the world of the vampires.  Wesley Snipes completely embraces the role of the title character and plays him to the hilt, with just a bit of dry cocky humor that is very refreshing.  <br />As we first meet Blade at a Vampire techno club (which uses a great remix of a song called \\"Confusion\\" by New Order) we just know he's a force to be reckoned with as he slices, dices, burns & just plains blows up every vampire he gets a hold of (including Traci Lords, in a very memorable cameo).  Kris Kristofferson plays Whistler, Blade's mentor and creator of the various weapons at his disposal, including guns & knives, bombs, & more. (\\"We have a good arrangement.  He makes the weapons, I use 'em\\").  But it's Stephen Dorff as the bloodthirsty Deacon Frost that helps catapult the film from average action fair to the stuff of comic book legend.  With most actors, this would be a one or two dimensional performance, but in the hands of Stephen Dorff, he turns the character of Deacon Frost into something much more multilayared.  The interaction he has with Blade as well as his other fellow vampires give off this feel of someone we should not underestimate.  Because a truly great villain is a huge key to a movie's success.<br />The whole mythos of vampires in this film moves the genre in a very interesting direction.  According to Blade, pure silver, garlic & sunlight are the main tools to combat vampires. (\\"Crosses don't do d***, so forget about what you've seen in the movies\\")  But the fact that the pure blood vampires are personified as old & disposable, while the nonpure vampires are young and virile, looking to take over and run things, can really be looked at as a depiction of our society, with the old guard being kicked out by the new one, lest anarchy ensue.<br />But \\"Blade\\" is without a doubt one of the best comic book adaptions to hit the big screen in a long time.  It is truly up there with Superman & Batman as the best of the best.  And New Line Cinema gives you more to praise about with the wonderful DVD Platinum Edition, that includes a nice audio commentary with Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff and others from the production and writing team.  The only disappointing thing is that everyone is recorded seperately instead of all together in one big room which is more fun to listen to.  Four Featurettes are also included: \\"La Magra\\" - which discusses the films evolution as well as showing some deleted scenes from the film (Deacon Frost's idea of freezing humans and harvesting them for their blood, plus the original ending of Frost turning into a digital effects blood monster.  You'll be so glad it was deleted once you see it.)  \\"Designing Blade\\" - a look at the production designs including interior, exteriors, Blade's arsenal and more!  \\"The Origins of Blade\\" - An indepth discussion with Marvel Comics alum, Stan Lee & others on the genesis of comic books going from kid friendly to more for adults.  \\"The Blood Tide\\" - A very interesting look at Vampire mythology in general beginning from the early 1900's.  Plus you get the definitions to most of the glyphs shown in the film, cast & crew bios and film credits, as well as the wonderful original theatrical trailer that still packs a punch all it's own!  <br />Blade - A True Comic Book Classic!<br />\\"Some [people] are always tryin' to iceskate uphill\\" - Wesley Snipes as Blade<br />Also, don't miss the incredible sequel, Blade II!

0684872153|5.0|Growing up in an Irish family, I always knew that no one could tell a story like an Irishman. So reading Frank McCourt's moving tale of his childhood in the slums of Limerick, Ireland, was like a flashback to my childhood, to those days of listening to Aunts &amp; Uncles and my Grandmother telling stories about their younger days; Specificlly the way they could tell the most horrible story, and still manage to get a belly laugh out of it, while also bringing a tear to your eye. I can't tell you how many times I laughed out loud reading this book, only to find myself crying over the very next paragraph. As Frank himself says on the first page, it's a miracle he (And his Brothers) managed to survive childhood. <br />  This book truly deserves all the accolades that have been heaped upon it. I finished it last night, and I'm already reading Malachy McCourt's book, A Monk Swimming, and I can't wait to start the sequel to Ashes, 'Tis. This is a remarkable book, one of the best I've ever read.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I loved the books, but this movie totally ruined them. While I liked the plot and characters, the acting was horrible! It looked like they just picked any kid off the street and offered them a job....no doubt they actually did that. I went to the movie opening day and paid... to see it, what a mistake!...
B000002MUN|3.0|Tom Petty remains as one of the most enduring rock stars of our generation. Although his work has been very strong with The Heartbreakers, he has done several solo projects, from The Traveling Wilburys, to Full Moon Fever. Wildflowers is absolutely no different.<br />Petty's 1994 album, Wildflowers is a very dynamic and tough album. The songs here capture the original heart and soul of his work with The Heartbreakers. Every member but Stan Lynch got to play a part on the album. Songs like It's Good To Be King, You Don't Know How It Feels, and You Wreck Me capture the true Heartbreakers soul in music.<br />Although many people still prefer Tom Petty with The Heartbreakers, his music is still as hard and emotional like never before. Wildflowers, with a Heartbreaker or without one, is well worth the flight.
B0000214F0|4.0|This is a hard film to watch.  But, if you consult your history, you'll find that much of who Caligula was and what his personality was like, is portrayed pretty darn well in this film.  This movie has things you can't imagine, but it all remains true to the insanity that was Caligula during the 4 years of his reign.  In fact, compared to the history books, believe it or not, this film may actually be a bit tame by comparison!  Malcolm McDowell does a very credible job as Caligula.<br />I don't doubt that Penthouse jumped all over this project to display men and women, but, as it happens, much of this was actually true from a historical perspective.  I don't think that Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud would have lended themselves to a film that was nothing short of a sex-fest.  No, they're too brilliant to have done something such as this.  English cinema and theater pride themselves on their biographical depictions...just ask Shakespeare!  They are very good at doing this.<br />This is a very hard movie to watch, but you get a nightmarish idea of what it must have been like to have lived under the tyranny and insanity of Caligula.  If you want to prepare yourself before watching the movie, I highly suggest looking up Caligula's biography, and you may discover that the film isn't that far off!
B00005B36H|1.0|I've been a Tool fan for a decade, but it seems they've lost it. It's hard to stay young, angry and alive in rock and roll. If a rock star keeps partying for too long, the drugs make just about anything sound good, and it seems that's what has happened here...The vast majority of this stuff is aimless, spiraling, and totally lacks any accesible or interesting melody - like a big, repetitive buildup machine that never leads to anything. If you're new to Tool, start from the beginning of their catalogue in your acquisitions. By comparison, this stuff [stinks]. It's no worse than most of the kiddie-punk...on the radio...but it is by NO means among the best albums of 2001. And it sure ain't quality Tool.
B000005GW2|5.0|I don't think Chet Baker would be rated by most casual jazz fans as the best male vocalist of his era...probably, he wouldn't be number one even for the trumpet on most lists. However, when you combine his better-than-average singing with his much-better-than-average horn playing and his impeccable taste in songs and his excellent choice of sidemen, you have durable art and a good value for the music lover's money. This CD combines a 1954 recording session with one in '56 using different bass players and drummers. My, does it all hold up well. Call it smooth jazz, call it lounge music, call it pop, even...it's all good. I like the '54 session better because those eight songs are a little stronger overall than the six he produced in '56. If anyone is writing songs this good now, somebody point me to them: \\"But Not For Me\\"; \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"I Get Along Without You Very Well\\"; his signature tune, \\"My Funny Valentine\\"; \\"There Will Never Be Another You\\" and \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily.\\" Chet didn't write them, he just demonstrates how good the writers are. If you like lightly swinging love songs, a little trumpet improv in the middle, and a short list of some of the best three-minute pop songs of the century, buy this one. Chet ended up a tragic figure, doomed by heroin, but here he is young and full of promise, enjoying that decade inbetween the end of the Korean War and the start of the Vietnam mistake known generically as \\"The Fifties.\\" Rock and Roll was just beginning when these sessions were held...ten years later, people like Chet Baker were relegated to cult-type followings, but when these performances were fresh, this kind of music held the main stage.
B00005QG9J|4.0|BUT I LOVE THE SONG &quot;BLOOD ON THE GROUND&quot;. Buy this cd if only to have this song, it is most definately worth it. The lyrics positively shine. Other songs are quite good, too --- Circles, Wish You Were Here, Just a Phase, 11am, Nice To Know You

B00005V3Z4|5.0|It is always sad to see and hear of such original movies that never get their shot on the big screen. Somehow being robbed of their grand vision. Donnie Darko is another one of those victims. I had read and seen many trailers and previews for this film but never got to see it. Much to my surprise it popped up on dvd this past week. I bought it straightaway. What an unexpected, mind-bending treasure this has turned out to be! First of all, the trailers I saw (which are included on the dvd) were misleading. It seemed as if it was a typical slash and stab flick. Far from it, I say! Part American Beouty, part eighties teen drama, part dark comedy. This movie has it all. Jake Gyllenhall is brilliant as the troubled title character. With the slightest smile or frown the scene goes from childlike fascination to mischevious malevolence. The entire cast was perfect, and I hope that this movie gets more of a following now that its out everywhere. If you saw it in theatres, check out the dvd. The deleted scenes are so amazing, they really unravel the story for you. If you ever wondered if there was something wrong with you, or if you were broken, watch this movie. \\"They are just placebos. Pills made of water\\" BRILLIANT!

B00005UEAR|5.0|I will keep my praise short and to the point - this is DT's absolute wholistic best CD.  It took me several spins of this disc to come to this conclusion, as I am a huge fan of this band, and am very fond of the epic SFAM, Images and Words and Awake...and this CD seems to pick the best elements of all of the aforementioned CD's and blend it into 6 degrees of awesome progressive rock.  <br />I was happy to see that we did not get SFAM...part III or something like that.  We are treated with some brilliant songs on Disc 1 that range from the very heavy to the beautifully melodic...and Disc 2 tells a story, much like SFAM did, but with less 'staging' and more to the point 'one song leads to another' a la Yes compositions of yesteryears.  <br />The bottom line is that this is one of DT's finest moments.  Petrucci and Portnoy are the 2 standout talents, however the rest of the band measure up VERY well.  What is great about DT is that it all comes together fabulously, so one can hardly say that P &amp; P 'are' Dream Theater - LaBrie is one awesome singer, Myung (very underrated) keeps up with the P&amp;P chops and adds his own flair to the mix, and Rudess - although cliche at times with his bits - rounds it out and adds a lot to the overall sound.  Being in my 40's, I can say that these guys listened to a LOT of the same prog rock I grew up with and loved.  I was very skeptical to see bands like this emerge after I thought 'real' prog rock was dead and gone (Yes, Genesis, ELP, Crimson)...but the honor to the true spirit of progressive rock lives in every note of DT's music, with the added excitement of some heavier themes, riffs, and variations on classic rock sounds we have all come to know and love...<br />This is a MUST CD for the DT fan, and probably one that just might make a few converts along the way...(so much for my short review!! :)
B00003CXXP|1.0|Bicentenial Man is a far better choice of movies if one has an interest in this basic plot premise.<br />This movie never goes beyond the most basic of premises and never pulls you in.<br />No surprises... within 10 minutes you already know the whole film.<br />With some movies, you sometimes get pulled in, emotionally involved and almost forget it is only a movie... NOT IN THIS CASE.<br />AI is so stiff and artificial you simply never care about any of the characters or what happens to them.<br />With all due respect to the hard work people must have spent on effects and scenes for this movie, it suffers from the common Hollywood ailment these days......... 95% special effects and 5% story telling.<br />If you want to spend 3 hours on human studies... rent and watch Bicentinial Man and the Straight Story back to back, but I can not recommend this movie at all.
B000002LKF|5.0|This is my favorite of Paul Simon's studio albums.  I know the critics prefer others, and most people I know say &quot;Rhythm of the ... what? ...I only like Simon and Garfunkel ...&quot;  But in my opinion the songs, musicians, production ... everything about this album is perfect.  And &quot;Cool River&quot; is by far the coolest 9/8 I've ever heard.
B00003CXXP|5.0|In these movies, it's not really the question if it's 5 out of 5, but is it 10 out of 10? Really they are in a higher level than 99% of all movies, and I think A.I. is almost a perfect movie and when I say perfect I really mean it, the story is multi-layered and complex and touching enough and the story telling is really remarkable job by the genius Spielberg. I wrote a review before so I don't want to say the same things again but I write this one after having the DVD and watching it 3 times more, the more I watch the more the flaws of the movie disappear, it's really about capturing the whole spirit and words of the movie at one time, and then it makes a sense but it's really a hard movie and I have still questions about the plot in my head, I figure them out one by one but isn't easy. But when watching again, ask yourself this question for example:<BR>If we can't consider the things we create as real, then are we real or not from the eyes of those things who created us if they exist in &quot;real&quot;? Find yourself more questions because the movie is questioning lots of things in 2 hours and 20 minutes, not look at it as a fiction only, the lightning and photography in the last 10 minutes is different enough to tell that what you see is not just a fiction.
B00005JKED|2.0|I heard from numerous people that this movie was great.  I was so excited when it finally arrived on DVD.  Boy did I make a mistake.  The acting was very good yes, but the story did not have an ounce of believability.  The story about Denzel's character having to pay off the Russians, or whoever they were, was so dull and seemed like a mistake at the point of the film where it was introduced.  Watchable but very uninspired.
0446677450|4.0|Overall, I thought this book was good to read.  Many of the ideas discussed are ideas that you proably already know.  But by reading this book, it refocuses you on your financial health.  This isn't a get rich book.  After understanding what to do, the hardest and most important part is the execution.
B000002G7E|5.0|I've liked the Velvet Underground for, like, two months now.  They are sooooo cool.  I read in Rolling Stone that this was the coolest album ever, so I ran to my local [store] to buy it.  I put it on, and I was totally blown away.  My dad says that they were kind of what started the punk attitude, and I can really hear their influence on bands like Blink 182, Green Day, and Sum 41, all of whom I love just as much as \\"VU\\"!  I told all my friends at school about them.  Now they play \\"Sister Ray\\" at my dances and I go crazy!!!!!!!!  Anyways, their songs are just really powerful and moving and really touching.  And I heard they were really popular back in the '80s.  I can see why, they're one of the better bands of that period - almost as good as Duran Duran.
B00000099Y|5.0|I have never gone through so many tapes & CDs of an album as this one!  Tool explores so many emotions & really rocks my boat with AENIMA!  Definitely the Grunge Era's GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME.
B00003CXI1|1.0|...Okay, the books were good. Then came the merchandise... Then came the movie. I went, as most people did, but unlike most people I hated it. The movie was poorly done. I felt like I was in a rollercoaster flying past fake dead bodies, but before I could get a good look I was moved on to the next. By the end of the movie I felt rushed and agitated. It wasn't fun sitting there and trying to figure out exactly what new scene was coming up, because they skipped so many that I got confused about where we were! When movies are done on books that were extremally successful then I think they should put themselves in for a long movie, however long it needs be. If Harry Potter had been an hour longer I think it would have been a better movie. As it is I wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone but hardcore Harry Potter fans. The kind that got their room re-painted with little snitches everywhere. And only own pencils that are 'Harry Potter' pencils. I pray there's no one out there so addicted but *shrugs* who knows.
B00005CCA9|4.0|I didn't like this performance when I first heard it, but for some reason it grew on me.  The tempos are different than I had heard previously and it seemed at times the orchestra had difficulty keeping up... but all in all - virtuoso playing.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|FOLKS!   This is DVD at it's best!  A two parter - first the movie, the the additional bits and pieces, and it's everything you've ever asked for - IF you like this approach to spectacular entertainment, it's absolutely not for Auntie Maud and Uncle Fred.  <br />Miss Kidman, quite glorious, strongly reminds one of Rita Hayworth - perhaps Moira Shearer, Ewan McGregor - equally grand as the innocent in Paris - and Jim Broadbent!    Costumes, sets, sound design, make-up - casting - all perfect!  <br />Much applause to BAZ LUHRMANN for giving us this unforgettable entertainment - and that's what it's all about - entertainment.   No need to muse, discuss or fret about this product - it's well worth its weight in platinum - give or take a diamond or two ......<br />More Mr. Baz - give us more!<br />As for the fairy?    Wouldn't be the same if not for this deluxe DVD with a splash of Absente, medicinal of course - just for inspiration and mood.
B000003JBM|4.0|Being a fan of Miles Davis, one of the key experimenters in the jazz world, I have always been on the look out for artists that have a leaning to the experimental and unconventional. <br />I had heard a few of Guru's later albums, and although I am not a fan of rap, his style was interesting. I was [angry] though that it was classified as 'jazz' since only a few were jazzy. <br />However I got around to hearing this album: Jazzmatazz Vol. 1. This is by far his best work. It was so experimental in nature, and the envinronment is obviously one jazz. The phat hip hop beats have have the same vibe as the instrumental solos in the backing tracks, and Guru's deadpan delivery of his rhymes are very good. <br />Favourites would be \\"Loungin'\\" and \\"Transit Ride\\". This album showed that Guru had potential to be a 'jazz' great, however his switch to a more hip hop than jazz sound on his later work is a great shame. Perhaps he will do better in the future.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Steven Spielberg has the unique ability to touch the Soul.<br />Forget about all of the technical mumbo-jumbo and all that jazz - it's the performances that remain - the boy [the artificial one], the mother, the odd 'tin-man' friend .....<br />And just where are the nominations for Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law?    Pity, its superlative work on a great, grand scale, but do not be overwhelmed by the effects, excellent though they are - it's really a love story.<br />See it THAT way.
B00005R2M3|2.0|If you have read anything else I have reviewed, I have tried to be fair (I don't know many people who have actually given a good rating to a Metallica album on the grounds of its artistic merit, event though he hates it) but I think I hate Shakira. <br />Her songs aren't terrible, in fact it could be good. However, I can't stand her voice! It is awful. Credit where credit is due; this is her first English speaking album and perhaps in the future she will produce a far better effort.
B000062Y98|5.0|All songs except bonus track are extremely complex and powerful, and indeed may seem chaotic first time. It will take you many spins to fully understand the album. Bonus track on US release ( Spanish version of ballad 'Harvest of sorrow' ) is not quite as beautiful as the original English version from the single, but ... it's just a bonus track :) Overall, it's the best BG disc so far and among the best metal albums ever.
B00005U18E|5.0|This movie is good entertainment.  Renee Zellweger is adorable in role as a girl that just can't seem to get her act together.  Colin Firth is his typical cool Brit, which I can't get enough of.  I loved it and have watched it dozens of times.  It's right up there with Pretty Woman.  I would love to tell you more, but if you have not seen it, I don't want to spoil anything.<br />P.S. If you loved Colin Firth in Pride &amp; Prejudice, he plays Mark DARCY in this movie.  You have got to see it!
B00005O3VC|5.0|There's no need to comment on the content of the film itself. Over 25 years after Holy Grail's release, you're either on the bus or you're not. However, the content of the DVD IS worth covering.<br /> The picture quality is excellent, much better than the VHS tape in terms of brightness and clarity and the widescreen version makes sure you don't miss a trick. The Dolby 5.1 also is very good, way better than the old mono, but the mono is there on a seperate audio track if you insist.<br /> The added bonuses are fantastic, finally giving Python fans what they deserve. Michael Palin &amp; Terry Jones revisiting the filming locations 25 years later is both funny and interesting. They're like 2 kids in a candy store. The hilarious Japanese soundtrack with English subtitles, the &quot;How To Use Coconuts&quot; instructional video, the movie in &quot;Lego&quot; blocks, and well over 10 other great features make this the definitive Holy Grail.<br /> If you've been waiting for the ultimate release of &quot;Monty Python and The Holy Grail&quot;, take it from a long time Python fan, this is it!

6305842442|1.0|I generally love Ridley Scott's work and the original theatrical release of Blade Runner is by far the more emotionally evocative of the two versions.  My only hope of buying a DVD of this movie is if they bring out an Ultimate Edition that includes both versions... Until the Ultimate Edition is released, I'll hold on tight to my VHS copy of the original.  There is hope that this may happen since Ridley Scott's Legend Ultimate Edition has been released.  This disk includes both the original release and a director's cut.  This would make sense for the studio since those people that bought the stripped-down sterile director's cut would also buy the new disk...  You know, if I could watch and compare both versions, I might start to appreciate some of [the] critique.  Who knows?
0679735259|5.0|I'm dissapointed to read some reviews where people give Dispatches 1 star because they didn't have the level of sophistication to understand it.  Thats a problem with your mind, not with the book.  The simple fact is that this is an amazing, mind-blowing, and horrifying book.  There are few books out there that expose the rawness and the agony of the Viet Nam War (or ANY war for that matter) like Dispatches.  It is not meant to be the definative history of the war, so if thats what you're looking for, look elsewhere.  But it does do the best job of describing the horrors of war.  <br />To those who tell you that there is nothing redeemable in this because he uses too much description, or he rambles, you're missing the point of the book.  In fact, some people call Herr's style of writing &quot;good&quot; writing.  If you can't handle something this eloquent and powerful, please read other books on the Viet Nam war.  There are plenty of good books on the subject that are easy to understand.  But if can't understand Dispatches, don't get on here and tell people that it is a bad book.  The faults are in your reading comprehension, not the writing.<br />The first time I read the book, I thought it was a very good book.  The second time I read it, I thought it was one of the better books I had ever read.  Now I can't wait to read it a third time.<br />Prospective buyers:  Ignore those reviews from readers who don't understand good writing and pick up Dispatches.  Read it and savor every word . . . it will blow your mind.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie, wonderfully directed by Baz Luhrmann, is witty, fun, and suspenceful.  It is full of song and dance, romance and drama, and is arguably of one the best movies of 2001.  The dance choreography was designed  beautifully and the innovation of mixing more contemporary music with a turn of the century  period piece was pure genius.  <br />The casting was great.  Kidman  (Satiine) and McGregor (Christian) are perfect for the parts.  Kidman pulls off her part nicely, while McGregor is simply outstanding.  Further, McGregor gives probably the best rendition ever of Elton John's &quot;Your Song.&quot;  <br />This movie is a standout in a year full of poor quality films.  The colors and images are spectacular to say the least.  The title Moulin Rouge is really just a pretext to develop a romantic love story full of song and dance, not to mention a little suspence.<br />The DVD is full of extras.  The features are also fun and enjoyable.  The boxed DVD is colorful and this expierence makes buying a DVD fun.  This movie is ideally set for the big screen, but is so well made, that watching it on TV is also fun.  <br />Maybe the genre of musicals is back, or maybe not; however, no matter, because this movie is pure fun regardless.  And sometimes that exactly what a movie should be - fun!
B00005RFQ5|4.0|For me, music has always been a happy marriage of prose, harmony, rythym, and poetry. A great song sends a message; a great album tells a story through many great songs.  I feel that The Rainbow Children is such an album:  it tells a story whose meaning and moral are known only to those who pay attention to the words.  <br />So if you love good music, with an R&B/fusion/funk-y flavor, you will like this album.  But if you have ever seen a rainbow and wanted to know what it meant, buy this album and listen to the words.
B000001FS6|4.0|When I listened to this as a kid I remember thinking just how unbearably pretentious is was. The whole message of the album seemed to be saying 'look at us we've arrived, we can jam with the big boys'. I picked up a CD copy of it recently by chance and was amazed to discover that behind the unbearable Bono there was actually a very good album musically. With age I have become slightly more tolerant of self-promotion. I guess U2 were right at this stage to feel they had 'arrived', after all they had become one of the biggest bands ever. I still hate the way they think they can speak for the Beatles- (I mean 'God Part II' give us a break!!!). The opening line of the album 'Here is a song that Charles Manson stole from the Beatles, we're going to steal it back' is still one of the most cringe-worthy in rock history. What makes it worse is that it leads into a totally pointless cover version of 'Helter-Skelter' which tries unsuccesfully to measure up to the original.  Beyond such weak beginnings and the fact that many of the tracks are just reworkings of earlier U2 songs there are actually some inspired pieces on here. 'When Love Comes to Town', 'Angel of Harlem', 'Bullet the Blue Sky', 'Desire', 'Love Rescue me' and 'All I want' are all extremely powerful...
0790729725|5.0|The of Henry Hill come to life here. Based on the book Wise guy. Shows the rise and fall of Henry Hill. Form the young Hill to the Mob Hill. The scams the tricks the jobs it's all here. De Niro Pesci Sorvino as Paulie. They all make the best crew. So many great secnes. A must seen just don't want to give anything away. See it now.
B00004VW5A|5.0|This is the best place to start your Elvis Presley collection. Every single song he recorded and released during the 1950s plus a fifth disc full of alternate takes and rarities. You'll see why his talent dwarfed all the other great 50s artists. As good as they were, none could hold a candle to Elvis. A warning though to any potential buyer, once you get this set...you'll be on the road to buying lots more Elvis!!
6304884419|5.0|The first time De Niro shows us what else he can do and it's a hit. His young son must choose between his fathers ways or that of the local mob leader. As his son grows up he learns the leasons of both lifes. The story is great you learn a little of all the charaters in the movie, but to much were there is still some unknow parts of them. Look for the surprize actor in the one of the many great secens.
B000002GY9|4.0|Solid.  'New Orleans,' 'Jitterbug Boy'--complete filler.  'Get Off Work,' astoundingly mediocre.  Should've closed with title track (sureal, great).  'Step Right Up,' 'Pasties/G-String'--cute, disposable, fun.  'TT's Blues'--not bad; not so good as public opinion has it.  'One That Got Away,' 'Invitation to the Blues'--yes!  Classics!  The latter especially.  <br />Not a five-star album.  Hardly.  Absurd supposition.  Nonetheless worthwhile.  Love the man, but most albums somewhat inconsistent, at least.  Better than most.  A grower.  Better to star with Blue Valentine.  Or Rain Dogs, for the later bit.  Fan's necessity, though.  Over and out.
078322804X|5.0|The Blues! The reason there are dvd's. John and Dan. Are on a mission from God. They want the band back. The do anything to get it back and play anywere to play. The extra's really give you a insight on movie itself. The movie is good you just have to see it to know.
B00005JKNF|1.0|P>In this film however, it completely fell apart. There was no storyline and nothing to keep my attention. It seemed that all it was was Altman playing around and having fun with his characters in a scenario, like a child playing with a doll's house. He has received acclaim for this approach, but in GP this technique comes accross as pure laziness with no respect for the time the audience is giving up to watch it.<br />True there were funny moments in a typical - but less successful - MASH fashion where amusing events, comments and body language came at quite a witty pace. Maggie Smith did a good job at portraying her snobbish character and I could see how Stephen Fry was trying hard to push the film to a more entertaining height whenever he could. But that was still not enough to make this into a good movie. <br />All that happens is a bunch of people come together in this big house, they are characterised for over an hour and then one of then is murdered. The rest of the movie is just people wandering about with their own little dis-jointed cameos. The only way the murder is \\"solved\\" is that the same particular maid overhears a bit of information during the course of a gossip and then goes and talks to the murderers in a typical pathetic \\"why did you do it?\\" fashion. Nothing happens in this movie that you can't get by watching a poor episode of Inspector Morse.<br />Watching it, I also felt insulted. A movie all about British folks having a jolly good shoot in the country would never have become this big without the missing link: an american in the cast. Sure enough, there he was. Amoung all the British cast, there had to be at least one american to make it sell(in fact there were two). There was no logic to their appearing in the film. I could see right past the whole scheme and it made the movie all the more stupid.<br />...and this has been nominated for Oscars???? What is wrong with this planet today? Why the heck has this film become so<br />successful? Is itthe cast? The famous director? Bribes? Or is it that the flimbsy nature of this movie is enough to appeal to the lowest common denominator amoung mainstream audiences? There is this assumption among people today that if they don't understand something then it has to be extremely intellectual. Sometimes that is true, but not in this case. I know that there have been many terrible movies that have been made into big successes because of being popular amoung a simple audience, but even this movie fails to deliver ANYTHING to appeal on ANY level of interest.<br />Pointless, Stereotyped - and above all - BORING.<br />That's my summary of this movie. I'm not an action movie junkie who finds quality, subtle movies boring and then writes reviews like this to slag them off. I actually look critically for good movies with some enriching insight. This movie simply has no content. That is undeniably the case and I expect lots of people to click the \\"no\\" on the helpfulness counter above the review so to try and punnish me.<br />Please resist all the unexplainable hype. Don't watch this movie and certainly DON'T BUY IT - money is far more valuable.<BR> <BR>I am very disappointed. It was a waste.
B00003CXAA|5.0|What can you say the title alone The Godfather speaks for it's self. Seen and heard like never before. The young Al and Robert are many of the great actors in this movie. The great seens never stop. The 3rd disc the extras speaks for it self. A must have for the dvd. A offer you cant refuse.
B000002GYW|5.0|The Eagles didn't invent country-rock, although all of them were involved with groups that dove into those deep, turbulent waters early on.  What they did was evolve and perfect the form, taking it to new levels.  Desperado is the quintessential country-rock album, a true masterpiece based loosely around the Doolin-Dalton gang.  The songs lead one to the next in a seamless blend of musical styles.  Folk, country, bluegrass and rock are all churned together to form something altogether different and wonderful.<br />Don Henley's plaintive Doolin-Dalton sets the tone for the album.  Bernie Leadon's Twenty-One gives the sense of youthful exuberence and invincibility a real kickin' edge.  Glen Frey's Out Of Control rocks your socks off with the boys comin' to town for a night of raucous amusement which then leads to the morning after, Tequila Sunrise.  Desperado is a masterful ballad beautifully sung by Henley.  Randy Meisner's Certain Kind Of Fool is the definitive song in drawing parallels between outlaws and musicians.  The Doolin-Dalton instrumental shows off their accomplished pickin' skills and leads into Outlaw Man, another rocker sung by Frey.  Saturday Night is some of the most beautiful close harmony ballad work ever heard.  Leadon's Bitter Creek is a brilliant ballad, its stark acoustic pathos a warning to those that would venture the outlaw path.  The Reprise ending the album just keeps going through my head even after fading completely.<br />If you are a fan of Country-Rock, this album is a must for your collection.  It shows what can be done when a group of highly talented musicians write some great songs and capture the magic on tape.  They blazed a trail for so many new artists to walk.
0060977493|3.0|The genius of this book is how forcefully it conveys that accidental happiness only exists in the shadow of tragedy. Roy's world is dense with potential, happenstance, melancholy, and idealism. All these formless ideas have manifestations no one could anticipate. The world (and the book) are filled with language, feeling and actions without order.  <BR>The failing of this book is that the story does not have cover its very large bones. The language is textured, but often &quot;styled&quot;. If a reader expects (given, very conventionally) for Roy to be fully in control of the story, he or she will not be satisfied.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I am the kind of person that usually guesses the ending of a movie or when the \\"good parts\\" are coming, etc.  This movie kept me guessing as well as interested.  Have seen it twice and can't wait for it to be out on video so I can own it!  It will then join my stack of favorites, including \\"Almost Famous\\" and \\"Gone With the Wind\\"...    P.S.  I have now seen it 7 times and still enjoy it very much!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|There were a couple of times during &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; when I wanted to get up and walk out. There were a couple of other times when I was almost moved to tears. That's the kind of movie &quot;Rouge&quot; is. It throws you for a huge loop. Take Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman (eye and ear candy), throw in some pop, rock and dance music, and add broad brushstrokes of color and rich sound. That's &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot; It's beautiful, vibrant, annoying, cheesy, bombastic, ecstatic, and uplifting all at the same time. And for that, it's definitely worth the price of admission -- and DVD. It's like nothing you've ever seen, and it gets my vote for most original film of the decade.
B00005B36H|5.0|i have always been a tool fan, in fact one could call me a fanatic.  lateralus was a long time coming, due to legal issues with their old label, so of coarse i was ever so excited to get this album.  lateralus, like all tool albums, is the type of music that is not instantly mind blowing.  it very gradually grows on you and pulls you in, the complete opposite of pretty much any other band.  like someone else said on one of these reviews, &quot;tool is an experiance&quot;.  for me it takes many listenings to fully appreciate or understand, but it is such an enlightning experiance.  lateralus is this in every way, if at first you are not impressed, don't worry, it just gets better and NEVER gets old.
0446678430|3.0|The wierdest thing (noone has mentioned):<br />After reading between the lines, I'd bet anything that HE HAS WORKED HARDER THAN 80% OF THE GENERAL POPULATION TO GET TO WHERE HE IS!  For some unexplicable reason he presents a life story that saunters into money.  And then he talks about skipping weekends, running several small businesses, going broke, going to work early, leaving late.  That ain't easy stuff -- but he seems quite happy with his life, good for him.<br />...<br />The book is a paradox.  On the one hand, I am EXTREMELY grateful to him because his RDPD \\"kicked me in ...\\" to seriously start investing....  On the other hand his website and RY book comes off as promotions for his whole system.  Kinda like TV evangelist who has some good things to say and lots of things to sell.<br />I've read all the reviews for RY and the reviews cover the spectrum of \\"horrible\\" to \\"supreme enlightenment\\". For good reason.  He does a good job expanding his earlier ideas (the repitition doesn't bother me, then again I blew through the book in an hour and a half in a bookstore) and his overall gestalt for thinking about money is appealing.<br />But his adoration of money leaves a sour taste -- for him being rich seems to be the ultimate.  I would frown upon such an imbalance just as I would frown upon myself else being so \\"artistic\\" that I became irresponsible, hurting family and friends ....<br />...<br />Both books are worth reading, but a healthy dose of skeptism mixed with an open mind should accompany your eyes.  For me, it has gotten me to study investing -- but in the meantime I have other goals and I AM GOING TO RETIRE OLD (hopefully rich) AND ENJOY THE PRESENT.
B00005JIZA|5.0|To anyone who knows John Mayer, they know that his fame is on the rise. This is well on its way to being a collecters idem ...even if you have the Sony release, I'd get this too. It may have the same songs, but the mixes are a little different. In time you will never regret picking up this CD.
B000005KQT|5.0|The work that the essence of Little Walter tightly got blocked.<BR>And the scars of his forehead are telling it,I think.<BR>You should surely listen this genius harpist,if You haven't listen yet.
B00005JKZQ|5.0|What an unlikely crime stopping duo, when Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro hook up as the fated partners of a new real time cop drama titled \\"Showtime\\". Murphy, who is an aspiring actor as well as a Los Angeles police officer is Mr. Personality for the cameras, while DeNiro with his deadpan sentences and facial expressions plays a perfect opposite. A veteran detective, he finds all of the hoopla taxing and detrimental to the job he has to do.<br />This movie is pure fun. We aren't talking academy award nominations here, the value is in the entertainment as well as the never ending one liners that just keep on coming from start to finish.  Kelsana 3/23/02
B000000H64|5.0|There is no way I can fully comprehend to you in writing how awesome this album is. It ain't no Joshua Tree, so I guess I can try. This is the album where Fear Factory gave up on being death metal(Yay!) and went for their own sound. Demanufacture uses a lot of elements that would never resurface on the mediocre Obsolete and nu-metallish Digimortal. This is an album that ravers will have no problem dancing to, to describe how prevalent the keyboards are. Herrera's drumming is lightning fast, and the riffing is about thrash-metal speed, with that grindcore bass, making this one of the heavier albums on the spectrum. Burton C. Bell does something with his voice here that switches from his previous Cookie Monster-esque death metal monotone to regular harsh thrash vocals. When he sings, it doesn't sound like the BSB-ness of future songs like \\"Descent\\" or \\"Digimortal\\". Bell sings in a flowing, gothic, way that really works with the synth backgrounds. The best cut is easily \\"Replica,\\" which for some reason just stands out. \\"Zero Signal\\" and \\"New Breed\\" really use the techno element well, and songs like \\"Demanufacture,\\" \\"Self Bias Resistor,\\" and \\"Flashpoint\\" just explode all the way through. All four of the members are so tight that you would think it was a machine playing, especially in the beginning of the title track. A great CD to use as a torture device for Linkin Park/KoRn fans. Easily FF's best. I recommend it.
0452281881|5.0|Wonderful read. It will have you laughing out loud - I couldn't put it down and was walking and reading at the same time. Yes, there is a sequel 'The E. before Christmas'. Not as good, but you may need this when you go cold turkey from the first one. <BR>Particularly funny, I think, when you work for an ad agency and recognize some of the quirky anecdotes.
B000002AH9|5.0|Recorded so near the end of her life, this is not an easy album to listen to. The pain and consequences of years of drugs, failed relationships, racism and hard lessons seem to have finally caught up with Ms Holiday, as she clings to what is left of her life, (or st least the bottle)   Critics may or may not have a point in saying that by the recording of this album her voice was ruined.   However if you listen beyond the pain and cracking of a voice once so pure, the incredible emotion is still there.   And it conveys a whole new urgency and beauty.   There's a whole life in that voice.
B00005B6C9|5.0|I really loved it.  &quot;This Is Where I Came In,&quot; is so very infectious! I kept seeing people in the supermarket almost dancing when it played.  I loved &quot;Sacred Trust,&quot; &quot;She Keeps On Coming Back For More,&quot; &quot;Man in the Middle,&quot; and Wedding Day.&quot;I don't know anything about the technicality of music or music production; however, I really enjoy hearing all of the songs  every time I play them, which is over and over!  I also bought the DVD!
B00005JKDQ|5.0|I have to say first off I LOVE THIS MOVIE and I can't wait to get it on video.<BR> I went to see it with my sister and I have now developed a complete obsession with animated films.<BR> I would completely recommend this movie to anyone of any age and defy them not to laugh ( I am 19 and my sister 21, and we both laughed unashamedly all the way through). <BR> And the characters are soooo cute.
B00005QW4K|2.0|I love Army of Darkness. I Grew up on it. Its a classic movie but the print on the bootleg edition is horrible at times. During the whole end fight scene you cant see a thing. Why they released it like it was taped off someones old Beta version is beyond me. Some scenes are crystal clear while others you need to stand 2 inches away from the t.v. to see anything. trust me its worth the extra 4 bucks for the original version i just learned the hard way.
B000002VCW|5.0|\\"Year of the Cat\\"....I'm having a difficult time finding words to describe this masterpiece. Brilliantly produced; seamless, beautifully flowing. The song \\"Year of the Cat\\" is a classic; the lyrics are captivating, the instrumentation perfect, and two fantastic solos: a sax solo and a guitar solo. I have honestly never, even after hundreds of intense listens, found one single flaw in this song.   This song alone is worth buying the CD. But there's so much more. All the songs on the album are very strong; not a weak entry in the lineup. Lyrically and musically, this is one of Al's best.  Particularly worthy of repeated play: \\"On The Border\\", \\"Broadway Hotel\\", and \\"If It Doesn't Come Naturally, Leave It\\".  <br />Simply remarkable.
B00005UEAR|4.0|\\"Scenes from a memory\\" is an extremely hard act to follow: the guys didn't top it, but came close.<BR>Let's go track by track.<BR>CD 1 track 1: \\"The glass prison\\". Without doubt the hardest track DT ever recorded, and one of the hardest I have ever heard. After the first six minutes, it loses momentum as they get stuck into what sounds like a combination of Pantera and Limp Bizkit. <BR>\\"Blind faith\\" loses me at times, although it has a gem of an instrumental section starting about 6' into the track.<BR>\\"Misunderstood\\" opens gently, and evolves over a semi-Tool sound to a harshly dissonant ending.<BR>\\"The great debate\\" opens and closes with a number of sound samples from a debate about the pros and cons of stem cell research. The lyrics manage to sound a bit preachy and stay ambiguous at the same time. Some great instrumental bits. (Never thought thrashing guitar riffs and Emerson/Wakeman style portamento synthesizer lines would work together so well --- check about 10'45\\" into the track.)<BR>CD 1 closes with the haunting, deeply moving 6-minute ballad \\"Disappear\\".<BR>CD2 is really eight songs worked into a coherent whole. The \\"six degrees\\" refer to six distinct clinical pictures of mental illness (manic-depressive in \\"about to crash\\", shell shock in \\"war inside my head\\",...) In all they bring this off quite well (except for a few somewhat kitschy bits here and there, particularly in the beginning of the Ouverture), especially considering they cooked up the entire 2nd CD as an afterthought in a bit of leftover studio time! Prog-rock fans will like CD2 much better than CD1: I like both on their own terms. It's good to see that DT continue to explore new musical horizons, without losing sight of who they are. Musicianship ranges from outstanding to unbelievable as usual --- these guys are probably the most technically accomplished band on the entire rock scene today.<BR>Overall, I'd rate it 4.5 stars; it's a great album, but not DT's greatest (that'd be Scenes from a memory, with Awake a close second), nor does it contain their greatest \\"concept suite\\" (that'd be the absolutely stupendous A change of seasons).
B00005B36H|5.0|hrmmm...how do i start???...well...i could start by saying i love this cd...then i could say that when i bought it i wasnt expecting much but when i heard the grudge it all came to me...the song is great...and it's not the only great one...i love them all...from the ones i heard on the radio to the ones that are slow and melodic...the sound is great and the vocals are good...i love the drums and the guitars the most and the bass also stands out too...i just love everything about it down to the artwork on the cover and the booklet...it's just great
B0000047CX|2.0|How frustrating.....if you have a stereo CD player that's more than 10 years old, then don't buy this CD.  While the music is great, you lose key phrasings to the low technology of the original recordings.  <br />1/2 of vocals of the &quot;Girl from Impanema&quot; is but a whisper.  <br />Great CD....but, be warned.
B0000047CW|2.0|What a disappointment.  <br />I thought that &quot;original recording remastered&quot; would solve all the problems associated with recordings of this era.  I've owned my CD player (Yamaha-very good quality) for 10 years, and thought I wouldn't lose anything.  But, I was wrong.  <br />Key musical points in the CD are lost, and while the music is some of the best ever recorded, you just can't hide from the lack of technology.  <br />The music is wonderful.  Wait for the original to be &quot;digitally remastered.&quot;  I don't know if this will solve the problem.  I am no expert on audio.  I only know this recording could be much improved.
0613181050|5.0|-<BR>\\"Mathematical theorems rely on a logical process and once proven are true until the end of time,\\" says Simon Singh, on page 21 of this impressive exposition of scientific method and the history of mathematics. <br />The author points out, under the rubric \\"Absolute Proof,\\" that there is a difference between the \\"hard science\\" of mathematics and the guesswork, maybe, and make-believe of the \\"pseudo-sciences\\" (sociology, anthropology, linguistics, psychology and others). Singh goes on to say that the proofs acceptable in these pseudo-sciences \\"rely on observation and perception, both of which are fallible and provide only approximations to the truth.\\"  <br />Simon Singh has a Ph.D. in particle physics from Cambridge University. He worked for the BBC where he co-produced and directed their documentary film Fermat's Last Theorem, which is at the heart of the PBS/BBC/NOVA production The Proof, outlining Princeton professor Andrew Wiles' solution to Fermat's 400 year old problem. (I tried to purchase Fermat's Last Theorem directly from the BBC, when I could not get it from Amazon.com, but BBC prices are too steep for a poor \\"Yank\\")<br />Fermat's Enigma is the story of Frenchman, Pierre de Fermat, who happens to be one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. It is the story of the world's 400-year-long effort to solve a problem he discussed, later to become the \\"Holy Grail of Mathematics.\\" The dust jacket says it is a \\"human drama of high dreams, intellectual brilliance, and extraordinary determination, it will bring the history and culture of mathematics into exciting focus for all who read it.\\"<br />Every innocent school child, with an IQ greater that his shoe-size, is familiar with the Pythagorean theorem, which states that, in a right-triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The mystery of Fermat's last theorem is directly rooted in Pythagoras and ancient Greece.<br />Here's the problem under consideration by Fermat: x(to the power \\"n\\") + y(to the power \\"n\\") = z(to the power \\"n\\") where \\"n\\" is any number greater than 2. Can it be proved?<br />The equation represents an infinite series of equations each with a different value for \\"n\\". An infinite number of equations can never be solved, therefore it has always been impossible to prove that the underlying equation has no solution; i.e. there is no value for \\"n\\" which would make the equation balance.<br />This is exactly what the genius Frenchman, Pierre de Fermat, claimed to have done, almost 400 years ago,  when he noted in the margins of Diophantus' Arithmetica: \\"I have discovered a truly marvelous proof which this margin is too narrow to contain.\\"  Thus was created a mystery and a problem not solved until Andrew Wiles came along. <br />\\"Wiles proof of the Last Theorem is not the same as Fermat's,\\" Singh says on page 283. Fermat noted in the margin of his Arithmetica that his proof could not fit in the space available. \\"Wiles 100 pages of dense mathematics certainly fulfills this criteria,\\" Singh continues, \\"but, surely the Frenchman did not invent modular forms, the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, Galois groups and the Kolyvagin-Flach method centuries before anyone else.<br />So, if Fermat did not use Wiles' method and the tools available to Wiles, what did the Frenchman use? What was Fermat's actual proof and how did he arrive at his result? Wiles arrived at his own proof, his own way, and officially, Wiles has solved Fermat's Last Theorem.<br />While it appears that nobody knows for sure, exactly what Fermat did, or how he did it, I believe that [one person] knows, but remains incommunicado, like Lawrence of Arabia and Gordon of Khartoum. Fermat's mystery will have to wait just a little longer.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I have always wanted to watch AI because of it's trailers and how they didn't give us too much information of what the film was about. Now, After waiting for AI on DVD, I watched it, and was *really* impressed. It was very compelling with lots of visuals and deep meaning to human emotions. I especially liked the idea of the toy robot, Teddy. Without getting too sweet, his part in the movie made me feel very comfortable, David had lots to understand about the real world and with Teddy being a guide for David, was an excellent piece to add into the film. Also, the acting is great! Haley Joel Osment is superb, as usual, so is the amazing Jude Law (gigolo joe), and very surprising was Frances O'Connor (david's mother) and William Hurt (david's creator). Both of them give very worthy performances in this film and gives additions in AI that deepens the realtionship between their characters and David. Therefore, AI is truly a movie that is sure to please both kids and adults.<BR>The DVD is also a great buy, lot's of information on the story and the characters. <BR>Not to Be Missed
B000002J2B|4.0|Wind &amp; Wuthering marks the last studio album to feature Steve Hackett. I think he saw it coming when the album featured songs like &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; and &quot;Afterglow&quot;, pop songs that would define where the band would be headed, although, particularly &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; still sounds '70s (whereas &quot;Follow You, Follow Me&quot; off their next album from 1978 sounds very  1980s). But of course there's still some great progressive rock, particularly &quot;Eleventh Earl of Mar&quot; and &quot;One For the Vine&quot;. There's the wonderful largely acoustic &quot;Blood On the Rooftops&quot; which obviously shows that the strings Hackett was using on his guitar on that song was nylon. Plus there is some really killer Mellotron. Plus there's the excellent story song &quot;All In a Mouse's Night&quot; which was written by Banks. But perhaps the biggest problem is some of the instrumentals tend to meander a bit, and so the album ends up sounding a bit uneven. This is truly the last Genesis album where Tony Banks' Mellotron is used so proudly (the Mellotron was used less and less after this until it was completely dropped by Duke). Although Genesis will become more famous after this album, selling more albums than ever, they obviously became less interesting, and so Wind &amp; Wuthering remains, as far as I'm concerned their last true venture in to prog (I happen to like And Then There Were Three, because it hadn't became totally pop, despite the inclusion of &quot;Follow You...&quot;). As far as I'm concerned, W&amp;W is definately one of the better post-Gabriel efforts, who knows where Genesis might have been headed had Hackett stayed.
B00005T30L|5.0|Great movie. Incredibly enjoyable dark humor. Perfect acting &amp; directing. Steve Busceni was terrific as always. The nice and pretty Thora Birch from &quot;Now and Then&quot; has got her talents fully developed to become an accomplished actress here. When I sit down and write this review, Oscar night is just 24 hours away and I will be very disappointed if the Ghost World gang don't bring home at least the award for adapted screenplay for which they are nominated.
B00003CXRP|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because I took 1 star away for its ending. I am a sucker for happy ending. The ending could have been done better...The crash scene was very well film. The acting was superb all around. The film was all Tom Hanks. He was either going to make it or break the film. Going with Tom, was the smart move. I was expecting more from Helen Hunt. Could have use any female actor to do that role and save some bucks there. It is a THUMBS UP! Got to have for your Tom Hanks' collection.
B000005AYM|5.0|A great CD to have. I've had it in my car for years now and I still listen to it. Great voice. Nice groove. It's jazz. It's hip-hop smooth. I can swing to it. Fun to listen to. Everyone should have this in their collection
1572522232|2.0|Dario Argento's film Suspiria is one of his better films.  However this is not a very good film. As with most Argento fare there is plenty of blood and gore to keep some fans happy, but the rest of us just keep saying &quot;Get on with it.&quot; After reading about how scary and shocking this movie was I decided to borrow it from a friend and watch it. <BR>The plot surrounds an American dancer who attends a European ballet school only to find out that it seems to be a witch's coven. However by the time Argento gets around to the point I had lost intrest in the film. Dario Argento has long been respected by horror fans for his movie making and directing. This reviewer can't understand why people fimd this man so good. Dario Argento is not the worst director (That honor goes to the Italian director Lucio Fulci, see Zombie review) but he makes a strong case at times. This is a slow moving movie that show's that with enough stage blood and FX anyone can be considered brilliant. Some of Argento's film have not been as bad like Phenomena, however his debut with  The Bird With the Crystal Plumage shows that he may just be good at thowing blood around. A real good friend has almost all of his films and I have seen quite a few of them. I am a big fan of horror and I will watch anything that looks interesting, that is why I have seen his movies. Dario needs to go remember that under all the blood there is still a movie to be watched. Argento and Fulci are one and the same. Both use too much blood (most likely to make up for there lack of talent) and are very sucsessful at there craft. I will say one thing for the both of them. They are out there making there movies and making a living at it by following there dreams, but remember the same can also be said for Ed Wood.
B00000ILGL|5.0|All right all you trance and electronica people....if you really want to find out where the genre started, buy this CD. Giorgio Moroder almost single handedly introduced the world to disco/dance into the electronic age with this ground breaking masterpiece.  Yes it has some dated elements, but these are overshadowed by the use of electronics as a viable and legit means of producing hypnotic dance music.  As the liner notes state: Only electronic intstruments were used in this recording..this was an understatement.  The medley on the B side shows Moroder at his seminal best away from headliners like Donna Summer (although Ms Summer remains as his best vocalist). What more can I say...GET THIS CD...take advantage of Amazons offer and get this along with E=MC2, the next visonary work from the legendary Giorgio Moroder....Keep dancin!!
6305313687|5.0|I went to see this movie becouse after seeing Ed Norton in Primal Fear, People Vs Larry Flynt,and Rounders I thought that he was an actor I should watch for. This movie is shown in flashback's and real time. Norton play's Derrick a white surpremist who has just gotton out of prison and is trying to get away from that life. However he find's his younger brother Danny, played very well by Ed Furlong, is following in his footsteps. The flashbacks are in black and white and show Derrick before prison and what led him there, as well as why he turned his life around. Strong supporting preformances by Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, Elliot Gould, and Stacey Keatch makes this movie all the better but in the end it's Norton that draws your attention. This movie is at times very hard to watch, but you can't look away. A great film even if the director didn't think so in the end. Norton recieved an Oscar nomination for this role but lost in a questionable call...
B000002JR8|4.0|Far Beyond Driven is pretty good. It starts off very thrashy, with &quot;Strength Beyond Strength,&quot; and continues on in a tidal wave of thermonuclear riffage, guitar slides, thundering double bass drums, and Phil's unmistakable vocal barrage. It closes with an atmospheric cover of Black Sabbath's &quot;Planet Caravan,&quot; which is done very well. The album is heavier, faster, and crunchier than Pantera's previous two. However, here's the bad news...<br />Phil did NOT take time to write good lyrics on here. Compare some of this stuff to Cowboys From Hell's lyrics. Big downgrade. He feels he's got to swear every other word to sound tough. The song &quot;Good Friends...&quot; is so nasty that I took off a whole star for it. We don't need that. Pantera has shown in their previous work that they can sound very tough and swear with a great message in a song, like &quot;F**king Hostile.&quot; It has nothing to do with being able to 'handle it'. Mudvayne's L.D. 50 has much more language than this, but the ease that they use it with makes it incredibly tolerable. Also, the music becomes very monotonous after the first 5 or so songs. Highlights are: &quot;Strength Beyond Strength,&quot; &quot;Becoming,&quot; &quot;I'm Broken,&quot; &quot;Throes Of Rejection,&quot; and &quot;Planet Caravan.&quot; <br />P.S. I almost gave it a 3, but judging by their earlier stuff, I realized no Pantera CD REALLY deserves less than a 4.
B00003CXCK|5.0|I am, and have been extremely interested in world war 2 and the holocaust for quite some time. I was shocked an appalled to hear that over 60% of students that graduate from high school DO NOT even know what the holocaust was! I am 15 and I feel that I am very mature for my age, and I know that I know more about life and how important it is than most of the pop/heavy metal obsessed teens of our society, who consider fine cinema any movie starring josh hartnett or mandi moore. And when reading a book on jews of the holocaust somebody asked me \\"why jews wore those stars around their arms.\\" having no idea what the star of david was. Continuing with my fascination of the war, I was destined to see schindler's list, a compelling tragic story of hope and tragedy. This heartbreaking story pulled me in from the opening lighting of candles, to the gritty, documentary like black and white shots that we know so well. While watching this you feel like there is a weight strapped to your heart, and that weight keeps continuing to get heavier, and heavier, leaving you sick to your stomach, that people would actually do this to living, breathing human beings. Worse than that, children, babies, babies like yours who didn't know what was going on around them. Think of what it felt like when we were children, getting picked on by bullies on the playground or being lost in the grocery store. You felt terrified, and when you're that small there is nothing you can do, you just stand and wait, your little heart aching for your mother. Now think of being in a cold, muddy concentration camp, your mother and father taken away, a man standing with a rifle, swearing at you, taunting you. As a child you wouldn't know what was going on, and wouldn't know that your short, unlived life, would soon be ending. <BR>Steven Spielberg made a masterpiece here, and should be proud.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is a one of a kind action film which takes the viewer into a sort of alternate reality, while painting the real world as a fictitious computer program. The characters take martial arts and gunfighting to a whole new level with their computer enhanced powers. All of this adds up to an adventure like no other. If you have not seen this film it is a must see for anyone who likes action/science fiction films. It is one of, if not the best film in its class.
0451169514|5.0|Quintessential King is the only way to describe IT. From start to finish, King has used every tool in his arsenal in IT to keep you coming back for more. Masterful descriptions of the characters and their surroundings provide a vivid image of who they are and what they are seeing. No one in any genre is able to provide the realism that I feel when I read a King novel.<br />The monumental fights between good and evil in IT are handled in such a way that there is no doubt left in the mind of the reader as to who is the \\"good\\" and who is the \\"evil,\\" yet the struggle is shown to be ongoing and requiring vigilance on the part of every person. King uses his ability to infiltrate the minds of the readers and the characters to provide a very realistic vision of the human condition. IT includes love, hate, anger, reconciliation, defeat, victory, submissiveness and dominance in various situations and ways to create the all inclusive battle of good vs. evil that is a daily struggle for us all.
0684833395|5.0|Catch 22 is definetly one of the greatest war novels ever written. It manages to be hilarious, ironic, violent, gruesome, sad and prophetic throughout the enitire 463 pages, sometimes throughout one chapter. The book isnt really about war, its more about a group of insane poeple in a bomber sqaudron and one character who is the sane one...or so it seems. It is also about how much danger there is in our everyday lives and all the truths we try to ignore. Soem may not like the ending, but it reall is perfect. Buy it
B000002H6C|5.0|I recently bought this album because in my guitar magazines (guitar world) they were always talking about meatallica on how good of a guitarist Kirk Hammet was. I always knew that metallica was good but I had never tried to listen to any of their stuff. So when I bought it and popped it in the cd player this sweat guitar started to come out the speakers and then I listened to the whole album and it blew me away. <br />Here are my grades for the songs<br />Blackened \\"B+\\" - It took me a awhile to start liking this song but after awhile I started to really like it. It has sort of a punk rock mix with grundge beat to it. The lyrics and the singing aren't the best but overall it is a good song. It has a great guitar solo on it <br />And Justice For All \\"A+\\" - One of the best songs on the cd(next to \\"One\\"). It has great lyrics, singing, guitar , bass and drums on this song. <BR>It has a great guitar solo on it too. This song rocks!!!!!<br />Eye Of Beholder \\"B-\\" - This song is average. Its guitar riff is kind of monotonous. Even Though it is one of the worst songs on the cd it is still an average song.<br />One \\"A+++++\\" - This is by far the greatest song of all time. Anyone who can say that this song [is bad] gotta be a total idiot. Provides a great rhythm guitar and lead guitar by James Henfield and Kirk Hammet respectivley. Great drum beat by Lars Ulrich and great bass by Jason Newstead. Great guitar solo (super fast like Eddie Van Halen or Joe Satriani). It is a great song about war. It accurately  desacribes the horrors of war. It is Brilliant!!<BR>  <BR>Shortest Starw- \\"C+\\" - This is probally the worst song on the cd. But it is still a quite good song.<br />Harvester Sorrow- \\"B+\\" - The guitar on this song is good but the singing kinda [is bad]  and the lyrics are dumb but other than that it is a good song <br />Frayed Ends Of Sanity - A - This song has a great guitar riff. It perfectly blends in with the singing. The the guitar  solo is also really great and the drumsrock too.<br />To Live is To Die - \\"A+\\" - This is the best insrumental yet. Most of them are usually boring but the guitar riffs and the solos keep this song interesting <br />Dyer's Eve - \\"B-\\" - This is where Sytem of a down copied there song Chop Suey from they have identical riff's. Of course this version sounds much better. This song is kinda punk rocky.<br />Band Ratings <br />Kirk Hammet - \\"A+++++\\" - THis man is just as good as Eddie Van Halen and Joe Satriani and them men. <br />James Henfield - \\"B+\\" - Good rhythm guitarist, Bad singer<br />Lars Ulrich - A+ - Brilliant Drummer. <br />Jason Newsted - B - Good Bass but needs to turn up volume on the bass guitar.<br />Overall this albumb is A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
B000002L7Y|4.0|If all you know of this Norwegian band is &quot;Take on Me,&quot; you've been shortchanged. There is real depth to this synth-driven album not often found in mid-80s synth bands. Every song on this album is a winner. Hunting High and Low kicks off with the pop smash &quot;Take on Me,&quot; which has been played ad nauseum on the radio, so let's skip ahead to the second track. &quot;Train of Thought&quot; is a good transition from &quot;Take on Me&quot; into more 'serious' songs to come. This up-tempo song is heavy with keyboards and Morten Harket performs a David Bowie-esque vocal throughout the verses, phasing back into his own rich style for the chorus. The third song is the title track and for my money it's the best song on the album (there may not be a better ballad to come out of the 1980s). Harket's vocals are soulful and haunting. This song will stick in your head (in a GOOD way). Next up is &quot;The Blue Sky&quot; which showers you with a layer of echoed vocals in the chorus and displays a hint of Pal Waaktaar's chops as a lyricist. &quot;Living a Boy's Adventure Tale,&quot; another slow song, showcases Harket's considerable vocal talent and range. &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot; received heavy Mtv airplay (when the 'M' in Mtv still stood for 'Music'). It's a pop song that is simple lyrically, but with a lot of texture through layered vocals and keyboards. &quot;And You Tell Me&quot; is a short, sweet ballad, perhaps written for someone in particular? &quot;Love is Reason&quot; is a light, simple song. It's a track that screams 'EIGHTIES! and sounds dated now, but it's still a good song. &quot;I Dream Myself Alive&quot; is another tune with a firm 80s stamp on it, but with some of the best harmonies on the album. The darker &quot;Here I Stand and Face the Rain&quot; promises more depth and introspection on albums to come. Overall, this is a very good effort. It's a must for any 80s collection, but it shouldn't just be dusted off when you're in the mood for 80s music. This album bears repeated listening.
B00005V0X5|4.0|Everybody else who has reviewed this CD seems to comment mostly on the sound quality. Since they've probably already told enough about that, here's a review of the music:<br />Last Rites/Loved to Deth - Absolutely incredible! Brutal riff with creepy lyrics make this cut the album's best. 5/5<br />Killing is My Business...and Business id Good! - Excellent title track. Again, nice guiter with odd but still cool lyrics. 5/5<br />Skull Beneath the Skin - Another good one that explains the creation of Vic Rattlehead. 4/5<br />Rattlehead - Heavy, good guiter work, pretty strange lyrics though. 4/5<br />Chosen Ones - The weakest track on the entire album. Still, it's not that bad. 3/5<br />Looking Down the Cross - Pretty good, just never grew on me. 4/5<br />Mechanix - Originally a Metallica song but still done to perfection by Mustaine&amp;Co. A great closer. 5/5<br />Overall the songs are good, and the production(which was horrid on the original) has been very noticably improved to produce a good debut of one of the giants of thrash.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Let's examine 'Escape', track by track.<br />1. Escape (8/10)  Great way to start off the album.  Nice, fresh, dance track.  I love the beat, and that \\"yoku ooooOoooo\\" towards the end is brilliant and catchy.<br />2. Don't Turn Off the Lights (4/10) I was really disappointed with this track.  It's just not Enrique caliber.  Sounds like a combination of Nelly (the rapper) & Nelly (Furtado).<br />3. Love To See You Cry (6/10)  I like the guitar acoustics.  This song sounds a bit like Modjo's \\"Lady\\", which is ok.  I like this song, smooth, relaxing, love, dance, song.  Catchy lyrics.<br />4. Hero (7/10)  I didn't REALLY love this song, although it was such a huge success.  Yes, it is catchy, and a beautiful song, but Enrique isn't the best ballad singer.<br />5. I Will Survive (8/10)  Brilliant melody.  Violin and piano mixes well.  But it seems like it's missing something.  Not sure what, though.  Maybe a heavy beat like 'Escape'?<br />6. Love 4 Fun (7/10) The opening sound gives you an 80's feel.  Then a 'never heard before' beat comes in.  I like this song.  Guilty feeling.  The trumpets work well here, too, along with the guitar.<br />7. Maybe (8/10) Beautiful piano opening.  Very catchy song.  I like it.<br />8. One Night Stand (6/10) Your regular club hit.  This song is ok.  I don't LOVE it, but it's fairly catchy.  Has the Cher 'Believe' sound.<br />9. She Be The One (9/10) This track is amazing.  I love it.  Of course, the title is grammatically incorrect, but whatever.  It's extremely catchy, and I love it.  The beat, guitar, it's all good.<br />10. If the World Crashes (8/10) VERY catchy chorus.  I like this song as well.  \\"if the world crashes down.... over me...!!\\" Nice melody.<br />11. Escape (Spanish) Nice to have this in Spanish.<BR>12. Don't Turn Off the Lights (Spanish) He must of run out of other material to have had to put this on.<BR>13. Hero (Spanish) Also beautiful in Espanol.<br />I'm sure Enrique did not produce this album to change the face ofmusic.  He just created something for us to have fun with, and I think he accomplished that.  Overall rating of \\"Escape\\" 7/10
B000002KFJ|5.0|I know most people think Paranoid or Master of Reality is the best Black Sabbath album, but I honestly believe that Sabotage is their best. Unlike the pure sludgefests of their early albums, Sabotage displays a degree of musical maturity not found in their earlier releases. To be sure, some songs(Thrill of it All) have a bit too much keyboard for my liking, but overall the music is simply outstanding. Every song from Hole in the Sky to Megalomania to The Writ shows extraordinary songwriting and musicianship. All in all Black Sabbath had never before and would never again come close to matching the quality of Sabotage.
0441003257|5.0|The book begins with a cast listing that makes you want to laugh like hell. The narrative begins with the purpose of making you laugh: &quot;These people theorized that the world began then. They were wrong.&quot;<br />This is the first book I have found where I laugh so hard at what's happening inside that I have to put the book down for a minute, then resume reading, chuckling.<br />Neil Gaiman is an intense author, and Terry Pratchett is masterful with words and ideas. Together I honestly believe that they have outdone even classics like Catcher in the Rye or The Great Gatsby. The sentences have power and put visual images in your head. The sense of humor is always present and always powerful.<br />The book is well-written, and follows a plot line that never falters, never leaves you hanging for more than you can stand. I recommend this book and other novels by either author.
B000056VIY|4.0|I found myself listening more to the latter songs like Walking on Sunshine, Cabrina, and Ain't It Funny. i still love the first 3 tracks, so overall this is a marked improvement for Jennifer :-)
B00005B4GU|3.0|With every step of Radiohead's musical odyssey, they have every critic and the majority of semi-serious music fans proclaiming their ascendancy and genius.  I've listened to OK Computer and now Amnesiac and I have to say, I'm just not a believer yet.  There's no accounting for taste, but as of yet I'm failing to be convinced that Radiohead is truly revolutionizing music, as we know it.<br />Amnesiac truly has its moments. It's a mood piece carrying you up and down in tempo but always burdened with a nihilistic overtone that nothing much matters in a world that's bound for alienation.  The highlights are the more uptempo songs here...track 1:  Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box and Track 5: I Might Be Wrong are dark dance techno rock numbers that are infinitely listenable but don't do much to advance beyond Depeche Mode tunes.  There are a few of the slower tracks that stand out like track 4:  You and whose Army? but too many of them simply drone on seething with disaffection and not really taking on any form.<br />I haven't came to the Radiohead altar as of yet and Amnesiac didn't lead me by the hand to take any steps closer.  If you for some ungodly reason are in the need of music to separate you from society so you can seethe in the alienation of a technologically connected world...try Amnesiac.  I'll give Kid A a chance to convince me of Radiohead's brilliance.  If that doesn't work...I'm moving on.
B000001GQJ|5.0|I have listened to many recordings of Liszt Sonata performed by different pianists and I cannot find best one,because a lot of them are very good.That's totally  stupid to look for best one . There's no such exist. Some people looking for perfect pianist and when they seem to find perfect one, others say that  perfect pianist is not good enough,because this pianist is perfect. In simple words I want to say that you may not like some things in Argerich's playing ,but you have to agree that she is a brilliant pianist!I don't care if she plays some places too fast. How can we possibly measure what is fast and what is very fast. Art is subjective, but Martha Argerich is a great pianist!
B0000009OP|5.0|I recently went out and bought some highly praised CDs, and out of all the ones I got, Morphine's \\"Cure For Pain\\" has made a believer of me.  It's amazing what the trio accomplished by stripping away any extraneous sounds and given a raw but varied soundscape.<br />The music is smoky, eyes-closed pure and retro-cool.  Dana Colley's baritone sax seems to be everywhere at once keeping up as an accompaniment and harmony to the vocals and then the next instance carrying on the burden of the slot usually filled by guitars.  It's pretty mind-bendingly talented.  Mark Sandman, who unfortunately never did quite discover a cure for pain to replace his drug use, sounds like a raw Chris Isaak.  The drums and heavy slide bass lines are in lock step making the songs jump right along and making you forget that people even have a need for a lead guitar to make music come alive.  When a rare guitar does appear on a song, it's a \\"Battle of Evermore\\" ala Led Zeppelin moment on track 7: \\"In Spite of Me\\" with Sandman's whispered husky voice making their music even more varied and beautiful<br />There is so much about this album that is rich, musically layered, and enjoyable that I'm sure I'll be wearing out my CD player with it.  If you are an eclectic music fan, don't miss out on this one.
0671027573|2.0|I gave two stars only because I finished the book through to the end. It would have earned only 1 if I had stopped and set the book aside, but I had to see if there ever would be a murder to solve. The first chapter was the best- and I really looked forward to reading more.  I was half way through the book when something finally happened. The pages read like a \\"Dick and Jane\\" story, no depth to the characters or the scenes.  I found myself skimming paragraphs after reading on end how Jaine shouldn't get involved with Sam. I was expecting a good combination of intrigue, lust, and suspense - didn't happen.  There was atleast one lust provoking scene, but the suspense and intrigue -zilch, not even one goosebump.  If you feel you must read it, pick one up at the library, save your money for a real keeper.  If you want suspense and lust - try Midnight Bayou by Nora Roberts, that one won't disappoint you.

6305428220|3.0|The Faculty is another attempt to cash in on Teenage America's on again, off again love affair with horror movies. The temptation to make them is strong because their budgets are relatively low, mainly because they rarely need to employ one or two expensive stars for marquee value. Parents may well remember seeing Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street, both of which came out around 1980, but almost none of them remember who starred in them. It is somewhat different now because so many actors in these movies are successful players on TV series or soap operas, but they are still young and inexpensive. <br />The Faculty is a modestly imaginative entry, even though it admits it owes much of its story to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The story is basic. Students at an Ohio high school have always been alienated from their teachers, but this year the teachers really are aliens. A parasite from someplace has taken over their bodies. <br />The lead players are the usual stereotypes. There is Casey [Elijah Wood], the nerdy smart kid. Jordana Brewster plays Delilah, the school's beautiful Queen of Mean. Stan, the Jock, is played by Shawn Hatosey. Then we have Zeke the Rebel [Josh Harnett], Stokely the Outcast [Clea DuVall] and Marybeth the Good Girl [Laura Harris]. The teachers and parents are also straight out of the Stereotype's Handbook. They range from mildly neurotic to dangerously psychotic, and this is before the aliens get them. <br />What saves the movie are the directing style of Robert Rodriguez, who elicits strong performances from the cast, and the fairly intelligent dialog. Everything is propelled by the type of humor that is best appreciated by people under the age of 21. While the horror is predictable, it fits the satirical nature of the picture. In one scene, one character says to another, \\"Don't you ever just want to be yourself? I know I do.\\" She then transforms into a hideous monster. Similar scenes are too risque to describe here.<br />Another plus is that the young cast is full of actors who are a cut above those usually found in such fare. I expect to see a lot more of them, especially Josh Harnett, Clea DuVall, Laura Harris and Elijah Wood, who has proved his talent in a number of other movies. Of the older actors, it was great to see Piper Laurie, though she deserves better material. Miss Laurie made her first movie when she was eighteen. I wonder what she thought of these youngsters, who are about the same age as she was when she started a half a century ago.
B00000DLUV|5.0|This is the Bee Gees at their best! One Night Only was the first Bee Gees album I purchased -- suffice to say, it wasn't the last.<BR>If you don't already own this album, you should be ashamed of yourself!
B00000ILBK|3.0|Insurrection is the ninth in the seemingly endless series of Star Trek motion pictures. Only the James Bond series has run longer and produced more movies. These stories of space exploration have proved to be a gold mine for Paramount Studios, but if this entry is any indication, the gold may get scarcer and scarcer.<br />Technically, Star Fleet still glistens. If anything, CG driven special effects have made the space ships and the planets they visit more dazzling. These new technologies allow such visuals to be sharper and more detailed. Insurrection gets very high marks for its production values.<br />Unlike the now holy Star Wars series, Star Trek's key to success has never been in its visuals. With its origins in television, where the cost per hour filmed much be much lower than it is in movies, Star Trek's following is mostly story-driven. The continuing emphasis on cooperation between intelligent beings from very different cultures is lifted directly from our own human experience. The degree of success for each Star Trek episode, whether it be for TV or for theatrical release, depends on the quality of its story.<br />Insurrection is not one of the stronger tales, and this is why it is rather lightweight and tepid compared to earlier movies. At the beginning, the usually delightful Lt. Commander Data [Brent Spinner] seems to have had an android's version of a nervous breakdown. While on a mission to study the inhabitants on a remote planet, he attacks the Federation leaders of the mission. His friend, Captain Picard [Patrick Stewart] barely manages to save him from destruction. We later learn the reason. The planet has just six hundred people living on it. They are kept eternally young by some ray produced by the planet's atmosphere. The Federation, hoping to appease an ally and to benefit from this Fountain of Youth effect, has agreed to secretly move the inhabitants to another planet. Data has determined that moving these gentle souls will result in their destruction, and it is up to Captain Picard to decided whether or not to do anything about the situation.<br />I suppose this is as interesting and fantastic on paper as other Star Trek premises, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The people who live on the planet are supposed to be seen as peaceful and loving, but as portrayed, they are mainly bland and boring. There is also a bit of Hollywood's unintentional but ever present racism. These perfect people are, of course, blonde, blue-eyed and beautiful. While this is certainly no reason not to save them, it is hard to bond with them emotionally. The suspense isn't there, because we know what Picard's course of action will be. The Federation's role in the affair seems to be a complete turnaround from its attitude in previous movies. Finally, since the population is six hundred souls and since the planet appears to be very large, the reasons given for their not being able to share the place are lame. This makes the outcome predictable, which causes the movie to drag. <br />The cast does a fine job, but they should. Except for the F. Murray Abraham, who is great as the villain Ba'ku, they act in the present incarnation of Star Trek on television.<br />This is decent entertainment for the whole family. Just expect to be a little underwhelmed.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This was an extremely well done movie. The music composed by John Williams added an incredible amount to the the movie and the mood was well portrayed.

6305313687|5.0|American History X takes its place among a handful of films that dare to address difficult subjects without any sugarcoating or watering down. The fact that it failed at the boxoffice is not surprising. In our modern age, what's most important it that it was made and is available for anyone who chooses to see it. <br />It is simply done, yet exquisite in its deliberate use of both black and white and color. The colors show often that the stark contrasts of black and white are often just an illusion. The world is far more complex than black, white and shades of gray can capture.<br />It is the story of an average American boy named Derek [Edward Norton in his Oscar nominated performance] who turns into a neo-Nazi skinhead. How this decision affects the lives of his younger brother Danny [Edward Furlong in his best role] and the rest of his family, not to mention the lives of others around him, is the focus of the movie. Yet it is far more than the story of a bigoted boy gone bad. It deals with the basic nature of racial hatred and plays more like a modern updating of an idea by William Shakespeare than anything else I can think of. <br />If I have any negative opinion of this film, it is that there was not time in it to fully flesh out every thing it addresses. This is a minor complaint, and is far better than films that go on and on about a thing long after we've gotten the point. <br />Edward Norton truly deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Actor. I never though I'd see the day when Robert DiNero would have a competitor, but if it isn't Norton, then it isn't anyone. <br />Every part of this movie rang true to me - the simple, middle-class family struggling to survive, the love between brothers, the scenes in prison. Even the somewhat cruel ending makes perfect sense if you stop and really think about the beginning of the movie.<br />Anne Dudley contributed here one of the finest music scores for a movie in 1998.

6305358613|5.0|Elizabeth sweeps across the screen with a splendor and a self-assuredness rarely found in the movies these days. Unlike most historic epics, it has only an average running time. It does not need three to four hours to unfold. It races out of the gate in the first scene and stays on course through its brilliant, mesmerizing finish. It is a film to be savored, and it reminds us that, at their best, movies are truly an art form.<br />If you are the type of history buff who insists on accuracy, then Elizabeth will disappoint you. Even Shekhar Kapur, the gifted director whose vision this movie is, admits that this is a romantic interpretation of the early life of one of the world's greatest rulers. I feel that, unless a movie's makers claim they are being totally factual, artistic license is as permissible in this medium as it is in others. Besides, it isn't easy to take several years worth of events and cram them into two hours. One has to hit the highlights and be coherent while doing so. Kapur's plan was to capture the spirit and the feel of 16th Century England. He has succeeded brilliantly. <br />I can think of no young actress other than Cate Blanchett who could have played Elizabeth so well. One effect of modern times seems to be that our emotional growth is slower. While immensely talented, a Gwyneth Paltrow or a Kate Winslett doesn't yet have the maturity to play such a part. The role requires that Blanchett go from an innocent girl, who does not believe she will ever be more than a princess, to an uncertain queen in charge of a derelict, poor country, to an iron-willed, worldly monarch who would make England the world's most powerful nation. Blanchett's portrayal of Elizabeth's mental and physical transformations is acting of the highest order.<br />Do not think for a moment that this is a woman's picture. To quote Elizabeth, &quot;I can think like a man if I have to.&quot; There is certainly romance. Her failed love affair with Lord Robert Dudley [Joseph Finnes] is a centerpiece of the movie. Yet Elizabeth is also filled with intrigue, betrayal, deceit, lust, power, and warfare. Scotland was not under British rule, and Queen Mary was longing to invade. Both France and Spain had plans to annex England. It had not been long since Henry the Eighth had broken with the Roman Catholic church, and the Vatican was plotting revenge. It was not the most opportune time for anyone to ascend the throne. <br />The supporting cast is remarkable. Joseph Finnes smartly plays Robert Dudley as an intelligent but vulnerable character. Geoffrey Rush's Sir Francis Walshingham is someone who is alone in being be utterly loyal to Elizabeth, yet who is also one of the most sinister and ruthless people imaginable. Both of these actors also starred in that other Elizabethan event, Shakespeare in Love. What a year is was for them! And what a year for movies made in the UK!<br />At the Oscars, Elizabeth was blown away by the delightful and far more commercial Shakespeare in Love; however,at the British Academy Awards, the Virgin Queen won in a staggering twelve categories, including Best Picture and, of course, Best Actress.
B000002X2B|5.0|That stands for \\"San Francisco science fiction.\\"<br />I've mentioned in other reviews that science fiction/speculative fiction is a lot more important in the thought of the 1960s than many people seem to know. In fact the works of writers like Heinlein and Sturgeon informed those ideals from the very beginning. This album is a terrific example.<br />Besides being a fine selection of music by some of the best musicians around, it's also a musical adaptation of a theme from a Robert Heinlein novel. (Not the novella \\"Orphans of the Sky,\\" as one reviewer has suggested, but _Methuselah's Children_, which is the one that introduces Lazarus Long.)<br />Paul Kantner was (and as far as I know still is) a tremendous fan of SF (science fiction, I mean, though I suppose he was also a fan of San Francisco, being the only member of the Airplane who was actually native to that city). He tried to apply it, too: for example, he and David Crosby once lived together as part of a commune operating on principles derived from Heinlein's _Stranger in a Strange Land_, a book to which Crosby also alludes in his song \\"Triad.\\"<br />This album is another result of that fascination. The theme is simple enough: a bunch of libertarian hippies steal a starship. And there's a lot of cool music built around it; Kantner at his best was and is pretty damned good.<br />He had help, of course. This album was recorded at around the same time as David Crosby's _If I Could Only Remember My Name_ and includes most of the same personnel (notably the late and much missed Jerry Garcia on lead guitar throughout, but also other members of the Dead, the then-recently defunct Jefferson Airplane, David Crosby and Graham Nash, and anybody else who happened to be around).<br />The musical result could be described using another SF (science fiction, that is) term, this one from Theodore Sturgeon's _More Than Human_: these musicians _blesh_ (blend and mesh) to produce something more than the sum of their separate contributions. Crosby's aforementioned album is another example of this phenomenon, and SF (this time meaning \\"San Francisco\\") music of this period generally involves a lot of \\"bleshing.\\"<br />The world could use more bleshing. It could also use more libertarian hippies. So if you're interested in any of the above, check out this collection of blows against the empire. The Dream isn't dead.<br />Warning to unwary shoppers: this is _not_ the Jefferson Starship that you know from later releases. This is the first album to carry the name \\"Jefferson Starship,\\" and it was mainly a Paul Kantner project that he developed not long after the Airplane went down. The Jefferson Starship of _Dragonfly_ onwards is a different deal.ibutions.

6305308659|4.0|Pleasantville is not a town. It's a fictional TV show from the 1950s, along the lines of Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows Best. Back then, popular situation comedies, filmed in black and white, were wholesome, but they also presented an America which existed only on the small screen. So powerful was the then new medium that we came to believe that these shows really did represent us as we were.<br />Pleasantville the movie is a visually stunning treat. Its story line does not always work as well as its technical effects. Perhaps this is because The Truman Show, which came out several months earlier and is a superior effort, covers some of the same ideas.<br />Tobey McQuire and Reese Witherspoon play David and Jennifer, two modern day siblings, who mysteriously get [pulled] into their TV and into Pleasantville. This is fine with David, who loves the TV show and knows every episode, but Jennifer is more than a bit upset, not least of all because she is suddenly black and white and gray. The strange TV repairman who got them into this situation promises to get them safely home as soon as possible.<br />There are many amusing elements in this TV town. The residents don't realizes that there is anywhere else but Pleasantville, The high school's text books have blank pages. Since they are TV characters, they only know how to do the things they have been scripted to do, which causes chaos when two people come in who are not characters. <br />As the two real teen-agers weave their sort of magic spell, remarkable things begin to happen. Colors start to appear. At first these are simple items, like a single flower. Later, entire people appear in color. This is where the technical brilliance comes in. Two people in color will be standing among a group who are black and white, but it is impossible tell how such an unnatural event can be done so seamlessly. <br />At times the movie gets rather heavy philosophically. While mesmerized by the beauty of the colors appearing around them, many of the townsfolk are very disturbed. One of the signatures of those old TV comedies was the idea that everyone should look and behave essentially alike. In fact, conformity was one of the most basic aspects of these shows. <br />Since Pleasantville is almost entirely a visual experience, I find it difficult to write about it in way that does it justice. It is not one of the all time great movies, because it tries to examine too many subjects. Still, it's easy to follow and has many parts which are immensely enjoyable.
B00005U18E|5.0|This movie is so funny because it tells the truth about what women think about men, and other day to day activities that we go through.  The thought process that Bridget Jones goes through when getting dressed for her date, every women will completely relate to it.  This story is about an ordinary women trying to get past her self-esteem issues, and is trying to feel sexy, even on the days when she doesn't.  Bridget Jones could be your best friend, or even you.
B00005JCAA|5.0|What probably caused this film to tank at the boxoffice and, thus, to get several top execs at Universal fired is its running time. At nearly three hours and with only one small action sequence, it's way beyond the patience level of some folks. In hindsight, it does seem strange that the nearly one hundred million dollar project would be approved in the first place, but I, for one, am happy that this corporate accident occurred. I like to savor things, so Meet Joe Black's unusual length was not a problem. Ironically, its a remake of a 1930s movie called Death Takes a Holiday, which runs less than ninety minutes. <br />The plot revolves around billionaire William Parrish's unexpected encounter with Death. He is literally visited by The Grim Reaper, who has taken fleshly form, apparently because he wants to know what it feels like to be alive. Yet, though the subject matter is mainly about mortality, this is the most life-affirming Hollywood movie in ages. <br />Death takes the form of a mysterious young man named Joe Black. One of the great casting coups in recent times was to cast Brad Pitt as Joe. The impossibly good-looking Mr. Pitt causes everyone's worst fear to become something serene and angelic - the exact opposite of what we imagine. It is then possible to see Death as a spirit that's just doing its job, rather than as some totally malignant force. <br />Anthony Hopkins is wonderful, as always, as Bill Parrish. Again, the casting throws us a curve. He makes us believe that someone can climb to the top of the heap and still remain caring and loving and passionate. Who else but Hopkins could conjure up a lovable billionaire? <br />Pitt and Hopkins play incredibly well together. Hopkins is renowned for bringing the best out in his coworkers, but in this case, I think Pitt is proving that, given material within his range, which is limited by his looks, he can be formidable. Hopkins can roar like a lion, while Pitt is more like a cobra, making his point with justa hiss. <br />I said this was a romantic drama. Love comes in the form of Parrish's daughter, Dr. Susan Parrish. Joe and Susan become more than a bit attracted to each other Naturally, she has no idea he's not so human. Claire Forlani plays Susan, and she is a delight. She's a 90s woman to the core, and she hasn't much use for romance until Joe Black. Their love scenes are quite believable. She reminds me a bit of Gwenyth Paltrow, albeit not quite as beautiful. I expect to see much more of her. <br />Marcia Gay Hardin sparkles as Allison, the older sister. Jeff Tamber is touching as her not so bright husband. And Jake Weber is over the top as Drew, the true villain of the movie. <br />The photography is glorious, as is the music. This is a film mainly for older audiences. I can see why Hollywood's audience of choice - teenagers - was underwhelmed by it. It speaks of things that are not yet of interest to most of them.
B00004TWSX|5.0|Queen are my favourite band, and I think this album is probably one of their best. When I first heard this album I was amazed! It is such a great Album. All the tracks are fantastic and they live up to the Queen Phenomena. Death On Two Legs, The Prophet's Song and Bohemian Rhapsody are just simply the best, I'm not downing all the other tracks but these are my top 3. This album is just the best, even if you're not a Queen fan you'll love it!!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Yeah, I know I know -Another boring musical right?  WRONG!!!!  Moulin Rouge is a wonderful story filled with dancing, singing, unique songs, exquisite color and is anything but boring.  Even if u don't have a love for muscials you will find this one to be very interesting as well as entertaining. Baz Luhrman's passion and dedication in making this film really paid off, after all he spent about 9 months working on it!!!!  This film has wonderful special effects along with a blend of songs that contain various comtemperary love songs mixed with a classical sound in the background. It is an absolutely wonderful soundtrack that you will want to hear again and again. The movie has everything that makes a film interesting-AMBITION, PASSION, GRIEF, OBESESSION, COMEDY, GOOD MUSIC, DANCING, AND MOST OF ALL TRUE LOVE!!!!!!!! Indeed it is a tragic love story between a cortesan and a poor writer.  I guess I didn't like the tragic part but when you see tradegy in a love story it really makes the audience feel the story more intensely. Nicole Kidman must've worked her tush off with this one because she dances, sings and wears high heels along with wearing bone crushing corsets for 9 months!!!! Ewan McGregor will take your breath away with his incredible good looks, singing and charisma. He is a wonderful leading man. The rest of the cast is superb. What also makes this film interesting is that you can learn alot about Parisian life in the 1900's along with a real life character Tolouse Lautrec. In other words it has  a little bit of history. Don't miss this film. SEE IT!!!

6303471714|3.0|Well this was the first excerise tape i ever bought and at the time i found it very effective and hard. But that was ten years ago and now it really doesnt do to much for me. What i dont like about this tape is the first section in workout 1 i mean leg swings? I doubt they do that much for you. Also cindy moves way too fast and experts always tell you to move slower to get the full range of motion otherwise you are using more momentum than muscule which we all know won't get you toned. Also another important noat this is a toning excerisce video NOT a cardiovasclar video. Even though your heart will get up a little dont excpect to count it as a fat burning session.<BR>Also i should point out some things i like about it also. This is a great workout for people new to toning very effecive arms and abs routine. But just go at your own pace. If you go as fast a cindy you might be cheating yourself.
B00000JMQE|5.0|Everything about this movie says i shouldn't like it. It's dark, cynical, and fairytale-ish. BUT, i LOVE this movie. It's imagination, social commentary and RETURN to the TRUE feel of the REAL Oz books makes this a movie a TRUE Oz fan cannot dislike. The characters only a true fan of Oz knows, the ones that read the books, come to life.<br />This is a must see.
B0000065O1|4.0|Well cindy did much better than her other video. This is a very good video for toning and the legs section really get your heart pumping and your legs working. Also i think the music is pretty good too. I like how she works on every part of your body. This is great for even a beginner. Except when she tells you to use three to five pound weights only use this if you are a beginner. I started out with three pounds when i first got this tape and now i use ten pounds and i still get a burn from the excesises. It is also good that radu her insturctor talks much less in this tape than the first one and we can all apreciate that! This is a wonderful toning tape.

Just put it in your car and roll the windows down and enjoy the sun and enjoy this fantastic CD by Keb'Mo'. He is truly amazing. Some of my favorite songs off this album are: &quot;City Boy&quot;, &quot;Victims of Comfort&quot;, and &quot;Tell Everybody I know&quot;.

When vilet finally gets on the stage, she blacks out... until she sees Kevin. then she has the guts to continue. She stuck it out and sung her song. Everyone loved her, and soon, LeAnn Rimes published it, and all Vilets dreams had come true.
B000002JSJ|4.0|The songwriting of this album drops dramatically after the great double lp of Physical Graphiti.  Nobody's Fault But Mine stands as a true classic.  Tea For One is Lep wallowing in the blues (I mean that in a good sense), for when all else failed they could always play the blues.  No hard rock band has ever played the blues like them.  Achilles Last Stand is a continuation of Page's obsession with creating an army of guitars, and it succeeds with pure energy and willpower alone; without Page's relentless guitars and Bonham's overwhelming drums, the song otherwise doesn't work.  For Your Life is Lep's most underrated song.  It's not great, but does border on being so.  The timing is a major departure for them, and the lyrics are complex and well thought out.  It's taken years, but the song has grown on me as much as any of theirs.  Royal Orleans on the otherhand I liked the first time I heard it, and I continue to enjoy this song to this day -- it has an infectuous energy and sound that doesn't fade with age.  If these songs were just the beginning then we'd be looking at another great Led Zep album.  Unfortunately, it ends here.  They created a heavy but poppish sound for this album, and thus a constistency that carries through the whole album, but the \\"sound\\" grows stale over time.  Unlike some of the great blues songs from their early album, I cannot listen to Tea For One over and over, and Achilles Last Stand grew old after only a few times.  And the two worse tracks are Candy Store Rock and Hots On For Nowhere, which are generic hard rock tunes which, however much they threw at those two songs, are unable to rise above mediocre.  Now I will admit there is more to Hots On For Nowhere than originally met the eye (or ear), but the song is just so-so by their standards.   So yes, the album is good overall, but it doesn't have the freshness of their others, which is surprising considering how fast it was recordered.  Page's guitar work, and Bonham's and Jones' rhythmsections, all sound a little stiff and formal, which it seems they tried to cover up by sheer volume, but it doesn't hold together.  Individually the tracks are good, but as a whole, the album is ultimately weak.  But it's okay.  This was no throw away album, nor was it...like so many other group's \\"in-the-midst-of-herion-addiction\\" albums, and is still way beyond the scope of all the imitation bands that have followed them these last twenty-five years.  Yes, the album could have been better, but then so could have a lot of things ....
B00000AFFF|5.0|I accept some people simply can't stand Elvis' nasal adenoidal singing, but you're missing out.<br />I'm listening to this for the 50th time, at ear-splitting volume with tears streaming down my face.  The gorgeous sweet-as-honey easy-listening production intensifies the emotional hurt packed into many of the songs:<br />&quot;I'm so drowsy now, I'll unlock the door / What fades in time will hurt much more / So here's that happy scene / Where you come back to me / It's only found in fiction.&quot;<br />And &quot;Those eyes I tried to capture / They are lost to me now forever / They smile for someone else&quot;  (the title track)<br />Wonderful beyond any words I could add.
0312952813|5.0|Hieronymous Bosch, exiled to Hollywood Division for giving a superior a well-deserved smack in the nose, is on the trail of a new designer drug ``black ice.'' He's certain that it's a key to a suicide (NOT! in Bosch's opinion) of a Narc. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Harry's pencil-pushing no-neck boss assigns Harry a bunch of open cases worked by a dipsomaniac detective named Lou Porter who could not detect his way out of a laundry chute. Harry is supposed to solve them all in the next week, cleaning up the murder file to neat and tidy proportions by New YEars.<br />Improbably, one of the Porter cases ties into the Narc suicide. This suspicion is confirmed by the murder of Lou Porter, the dipsomaniac. So Harry heads off to Mexico where all the clues are pointing. There things really become improbable (if they weren't alreaday), but Connelly makes it easy to suspend disbelief.  There are also sorts of goings-on and derring-do including an eyebrow raising scene with el Gran Torero, Harry Bosch. If you are still taking this story seriously by now, you clearly need a humor infusion. <br />Unfortunately, despite it's inventive prankery, the story ends with a thud -- as a wholly predictable \\"surprise\\" ending plays out. Folks who are surprised haven't been paying attention. <br />Still, I loved this book, but only by looking at it as a great piece of humor.
B00005JKED|5.0|I have to say, I really missed out on this one in the theaters. But after watching it on DVD, I can see why both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke were nominated for Oscars. Both gave riveting performances. The story itself was good...it kept you at the edge of your seat. Definite must have for your collection
0060934913|3.0|Well, after reading this, I will never order fish on Mondays. Actually, I picked up a few useful tips that I will be grateful for. I expecially appreciate the tips on avoiding food poisoning in restaurants, having experienced it once, I want to avoid it at all costs. <br />On the other hand, the book is full of glib machismo posturing, at times relentlessly shallow. Since shallow has its place and it was entertaining, I rated it a respectable C.
0790729342|5.0|Before I wathced &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; I was expectitng another good, but not great comic bookish action thriller with a classic superhero. By the end of the movie I was totally blown away. &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; as one of the best naritive drives I have ever sceen and The Road Warriors concept is way ahead of its time.<BR>Aside from &quot;Bravehart&quot; Meal Gibson gives this a 110% good, soild effort. In my opion &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; is far better than<BR>&quot;Mad Max&quot;, and you don't even have to watch Mad Max to understand were this movie is coming from, because the movie explains its self so well. BUY THIS ONE!
B000002KD9|5.0|Hauntingly beautiful, inspiring, uplifting, and depressing. I first heard this album in 1974 and it changed me. A powerful emotion evoking piece of magickal/musical art. Impossible to properly translate into words. Definitely needs to be experienced.
6304005490|4.0|This movie was one of a slew of Doris Day's movies that I saw back in the early sixties,beginning with \\"Pillow Talk\\" and ending with \\"Send Me No Flowers\\". Thank GAWD I never saw any of the ones she did with Rod Taylor back then! Whoever put HIM together with HER had a screw loose! Anyway, to get back to this film, this is definitely one of Day's most slapstick movies, with a heavy accent on commercial satire.<br />This film was done in the classic style of romantic comedies back then....lots of cameos and supporting roles for actors familiar to movie audiences from TV, (\\"Schulze\\" from \\"Love that Bob\\" who was also \\"Alice\\" from \\"The Brady Bunch\\", Edie Adams, Jack Krutschen,) glitzy, technicolor cinematography, and a state of the art new car for the leading man. It's the usual Doris/Rock formula....Rock is the unrepentant bachelor with the little black book from [heck]; Doris is the virtuous working woman in the same field that ends up resenting him through some early negative confrontation in the movie. The writers usualy engineer their amorous encounters by keeping Rock's actual VISUAL identity a secret...Doris usually hates him sight unseen through phone contact or rumor, but they rely on Rock's charm to deceive Do-Do into ALMOST doing the deed with him, with her discovering the subterfuge only at the last minute.<br />I'm not giving away any major plot points here, that's the way it was with ALL the Doris/Rock movies....she was always MARRIED to Jim Garner! Anyway...the film is hilarious, has Tony Randall, for ONCE, not playing a priss, and it has GREAT sight gags! If you're a fan of either Doris or want to see a ronantic comedy like they don't make anymore, first rent this movie, then buy, because I guarantee the whole family's going to love it!
B00001QEBQ|5.0|I had not heard the chinese fable about a girl who impersoantes a male soldier and saves China. I'm sure Disney took some liberties with the story, as they do all that get turned into mass-entertainment. This film is exceptionally well-done. The vocal casting is spot-on, with Eddie Murphy nearly stealing the show as Mushu, the wise-cracking dragon sent(?) by her ancestors to protect her. The love Mulan has for her family, her father in particular, is well-represented here, as it is her love for him that drives her to take his place in the Chinese army. What would any of us do to save the life of someone we love? The fight scenes are awesome, being of higher quality than many live-action movies. The songs are top-notch, especially 'Reflection', and 'Be A Man'. What should please some is that the charactors don't break into song at the drop of a hat, as is usual in many animated films nowadays, but rather the songs are dispersed throughout the film, and only five songs at that.<BR>The animation is superb, the vocal talent is perfect in their roles, and the plot is well-thought out. A definate feather in the cap of Disney!
B000002KBU|5.0|please listen.  &quot;California&quot; never sounded so good.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This film was a runaway hit back in 1993, and still carries quite a punch today. If a really deep story and plot are what you are looking for, go elsewhere. If you want jaw-dropping effects, sheer amazement, and spine-tingling chills, look no further.<BR>The point of this film is that dinosaurs can now be produced by cloning. That said, many different species have been created and put into a park setting for tourists to ride through and spend money in. Naturally, the parks developer doesn't see the danger involved, only the happy faces of children the world over as they hear that dinosaurs once more walk the earth.<BR>Of course, things go wrong. A disgruntled employee shuts the park systems down in order to steal and sell dino-embryos to an outside competitor. Of course, a tropical storm hits at just that time, disrupting his and everyone else's plans. In the chaos that ensues, several big dinos escape their pens, notably the T-Rex, who then proceed to have a buffet meal of the visitors.<BR>The main principles among the humans escpae at the end, leaving the dinos free to do what they will. Being a dinosaur fan since early childhhod, I was thrilled this movie came out. When the first sauropod walked majesticaly across the screen, I was in awe. It all seemed so real! That feeling of awe was keenly built by Spielberg in this film, which then was turned into a feeling of danger, then to doom.<BR>The real stars of this movie are, of course, the dinosaurs, both CG and robotic and puppet. They intermove with the real people so seamlessly you believe they are real as well. This was one I very quickly added to my DVD collection, where it has provived many hours of enjoyment. The picture transfer is perfect, and the sound is incredible.<BR>Despite some flaws, like one-dimensional charactors, amd weak plot, the breathtaking special effects more than make up for it, and make this one worth owning.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I'm not going to waste time repeating the names of the bands they ripped off. Several people have already listed them.  I saw an interview with them; they seemed shallow and self-conscious.  I saw their boring and pretentious video.  They look like pseudo-junkie Banana Republic models.  Rock n' roll is dead. Buy the old stuff and stop whining.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Would anybody be totally happy with anything George Lucas came out with following the outrageous build-up for this film? Probably not, but one tends to think he could have done just a bit better than this. I know there are some &quot;Star&quot; fans who adore anything new about &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and there were many who despised this film after only half the film. Granted, I hated Jar-Jar Binks, myself, thinking he was just too silly for words. But the film does have some really fine moments, and some greatness, too. <BR>No matter what I thought of the film, however, I really have to take my hat off to Mr. Lucas for putting out such a high-quality DVD. The picture transfer is exceptional, the sound out-of-this-world, and enough extras to satisfy ANYBODY. All included, the film and extras take up two discs, with all sorts of behind the scenes stuff and commentary.<BR>Really, only DVD does this film any kind of justice, because only here can one see all the background scenery in all its complex glory. One can watch this film many times and still see something new every time. What incredible detail.<BR>Well, as I said, the film could have been better, but it does have its moments, and the DVD is one of the best ever produced, so indeed well-worth including in any DVD collection.
6305428220|4.0|This was indeed a great movie that you should see but, I wouldn't classify it as horror.  It had a lot of good action in it and it was pretty funny in some parts.  If you are looking for a good horror, then don't get this... I would recommend &quot;Scream&quot;.  This is a very good movie, though and if you're in the mood for teachers that are from another planet then, Go rent it!
6300246787|3.0|I can overlook the fact that Barbara Streisand is 20 years too young for the role of Dolly Levi; after all, Striesand works wonders with the show's songs and plays her scenes with enjoyable comic flair.  What I cannot overlook is the fact that the script could have been rewritten to accomodate the age change and it wasn't--and that's only the beginning in this movie that has a bigger budget than good sense.<br />The stage version of HELLO, DOLLY was actually a mid-size musical--but when the property went Hollywood a ton of money was poured into the film, and the result is a movie so determined to be BIG and FLASHY and LOUD that it cramed extras, chorus boys, period furniture, and every other expensive and unnecessary thing you can imagine into every square inch it could find.  As a result the whole thing feels about as light and airy and fun as Hoover Dam, and neither Gene Kelly's direction nor his skilled cast can hold it up.<br />The overall cast is pretty good and they all play rather well together.  As previously noted, Streisand gives a truly wonderful turn as Dolly Levi; Matthau is quite funny in an appropriately grumpy way; and all the supporting actors are well cast.  Although the choreography leaves a lot to be desired, the musical numbers are very entertaining, and Barbara and company occasionally manage to create one or two memorable moments--Louis Armstrong's cameo appearance among them.  But the film itself is awkward, clumsy and over-done. I can't help but think that it would have been a much better film if they had hired a good writer to resolve the age issue--and then cut the budget by about half and relied more upon imagination and creativity than upon bucks.<br />--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--

0790743507|5.0|SINGIN' IN THE RAIN's story is well known, and concerns 1920s silent romantic acting team Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen.)  Trouble is that sound is coming in--and Lina's speaking voice could peel paint off the wall.  The solution?  Don's best friend (Donald O'Connor) and love interest (Debbie Reynolds) have the inspiration of revamping Lockwood and Lamont's debut sound film as a musical, with Reynolds dubbing Hagen's vocals.  The resulting story is a high-energy, extremely witty, and truly sparkling film laced with period songs by Arthur Freed, a film that many regard as the single finest musical to emerge from Hollywood.<br />In many respects SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a throwback to the early musicals of the era it satirizes, for many of its musical numbers ('Make 'em Laugh' is a notable example) have absolutely nothing to do with the story it tells--but unlike such early musicals the storyline is exceptionally strong, and since the film is about the creation of an early &quot;all talking, all dancing, all singing&quot; movie in which such musical numbers were typical, they have here a certain validity that could not otherwise be achieved.  The cast is absolutely flawless, and without exception Kelly, Reynolds, O'Connor, and Hagen (particularly memorable as the literally unspeakable silent star) give the finest performances of their respective careers.  The musical numbers range from the vibrant and complex 'Good Morning' to the lyrical 'You Are My Lucky Star' to the brilliantly conceived and executed title song, each without exception the definition of perfection. The art designs are meticulous, beautiful, and recreate the late-silent and early-sound era of Hollywood with considerable wit and charm.  As a whole, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN possesses an engergy and vitality that simply makes you bounce in your seat from excitement.<br />SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a musical that even people who hate musicals love.  Whether or not you consider it &quot;the&quot; finest musical ever created by Hollywood is, ultimately, a matter of personal preference; there are several contenders for that title, most notably MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, GIGI, and THE WIZARD OF OZ.  But no matter where you personally rank it, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is certainly ONE of the best, a film that simply gains in critical and popular stature with every passing year, a national and a world treasure of cinematic art.uot; finest musical ever created by Hollywood is, ultimately, a matter of personal preference; there are several contenders for that title, most notably MEET ME IN ST.

B00005V9HA|5.0|This is one of my top 5 FAVE horror movies of all time. The spfx are excellent, and acting is very good for this type film. Jeffrey Combs and Bruce Abbott are great. One tip. Stay away from the \\"R\\" rated version! It's longer but has more scenes which are not relevant to the overall enjoyment of this film, and the really gross stuff is not in this version. The \\"unrated\\" version is the one to see. All of the added goodies will ony enhance the \\"Re-Animator\\" experience. Fans of this film would also need to check out \\"Bride of Re-Animator\\"...
B000060P79|5.0|Hello everyone out there you should all check out the cd it is wicked awesome! I saw the band live at the Jam Des Neiges and they sounded just as good live as they do on the cd if not better because you get to see them up close. They really do get you going and make you want to sing along and dance. The songs are based on the average teens life and is a good way to make you feel that you are not alone.My favorite songs are in order as follows \\"I'd do anything\\", \\"When I'm with you\\", \\"Won't be there\\", \\"Addicted\\" well as writing this i figured that i cant say which ones are the best because i love them all. I bet you will to but you have to judge that for yourselves i hope my comments influence you to get this cd. ITS AWESOME...
B000001FSU|5.0|True thrashy, speedy, comical, humorous thrash metal!!! Anthrax may not have been as evil and fast and angry as Slayer or Sepultura or Sodom but they were just as good. The song \\"Antisocial\\" should be a thrash anthem right up there with classics like Slayer's \\"Raining Blood\\", Sepultura's \\"Inner Self\\", and Sodom's \\"Nuclear Winter\\". Anthrax was never as deadly of a band they took the more melodic end of the 80's thrash scene but they certainly weren't a commercial or trendy band. This proves that you dont have to be evil as hell (although that doesnt hurt) to be a succesful thras band. Anthrax!!

B00002EPJH|5.0|In one of the most beautiful piano jazz albums I own, Keith Jarrett takes eleven standard songs about love and gives them a nighttime, quiet-by-the-fireplace treatment.  He was obviously inspired/influenced by jazz pianists like Bill Evans and Barbara Carroll to name just two, but this album is certainly not a re-tread.  It is an original.<br />Jarrett can do almost anything on the piano.  I not only own some of his wonderful jazz recordings like &quot;Whisper Not,&quot; but also classical recordings of works by Shostakovitch and Haydn.  Everything Jarrett records comes out golden.<br />Every tune on this CD is special, but I particularly enjoyed the Gershwins' &quot;I Loves You, Porgy&quot; and Oscar Levant's &quot;Blame It On My Youth&quot; (a gorgeous song with a great lyric which, sadly, so few people sing or play).  The American folksong &quot;Shenandoah&quot; is given a lovely, surprising arrangement by Jarrett.  This album is a treasure.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00003CXXR|1.0|First a confession: I watched this with the preconception that sequels, ESPECIALLY the third of a series, are nonsense. So far only Back to the Future 3, Last Crusade and Return of the Jedi have disproved the rule. But JP3 does not. I will be brief, as was the film.<BR>   The plot is typically brainless for a sequel, and even with a story it feels as though we're just wandering from one contrived action sequence to the next. The other two films set up conventions (ie these characters die, these don't) and now we know what to expect... so when half the plane crew get eaten, it comes as no surprise. <BR>   The cast are passable. Niell and Nivola are excellent, but much as they appear as the only dinosaur experts in the story, they also seem to be the only credible actors. They are surrounded by William H. Macy, doing that-nice-American-guy he does in every film, and Tia Lioni, loud, annoying... B-List! Alan's loathing of being involved is more than felt by us.<BR>   And the effects... Personally, I've heard a lot of praise. But why? The computer-dinosaurs really LOOK like computer-dinosaurs, in all their out of place glory. And the model dinosaurs have such slow, jerky movements that make them reminiscent of the stop motion Harryhausen movies that paved the way for Jurassic Park. These effects are awful!<BR>   And the Spinosaurus. Included purely for the sake of having another dinosaur, with no explanation (even Niell points out that Spinosaurus shouldn't be there), it is a strange creature, and if it weren't the main monster, we would wonder why it follows the cast throughout. The fight with the T-rex is disconcerting... at this point, I realised I was rooting for the T-rex! It's death more than symbolised the direction this film was taking Jurassic Park.<BR>   And the hideously under-developed raptor idea... what was that again? They're intelligent? Clearly forgotten during script-writing, the idea is picked up again at the end for a last minute confrontation. And then a rushed end, everyone is happy, the dinosaurs are back in the jungle where they can't hurt anyone... and we're left wondering what the point was.<BR>   Perhaps it's thankful that it was only 90/100 minutes. It was stretched at that, too.
B00005T30L|5.0|The two pivotal characters in this film are played by Thora Birch, as a recent high school graduate, and Steve Buscemi, as a middle aged vintage record collector who is most comfortable back with his collection in the 1940s. Neither of these fits into our present day society. The film starts with Birch playing a cruel prank on Buscemi's loneliness via his ad in a personals column but she gradually becomes intrigued by him.  Although this film has a high comedic moments, it is not a comedy.  It is a very serious study of 2 people who could be voted for as most likely to be dumped on by our society and culture.<br /><br />A reoccuring scene in the film, of an old man waiting for a phantom bus to carry him away from it all, perhaps captures the overall mood and trajectory of the film best.  Birch's character is fascinated by him.  When she tells him that the bus doesn't come there any more, he tells her that she doesn't know what she is talking about.  This is a metaphor for the whole film and the magical realism underlying the entire work. Ileana Douglas as the trendiest of art teachers without an ounce of integrity in her being plays out some highly comic but disturbing moments in the film.  She stands for everything that is wrong with art education as we know it.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00005YW4H|4.0|Somebody thank Diana Krall for paving the way for this young stalwart. More beautiful, natural, and also a piano player, however, she has one thing she can hold over Krall's head: songwriting talent. Sure, she does some covers here and there (Hank Williams' &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot;), but proves more than her worth by offering up a smattering of her own as well.<br />Her voice is a unique blend of Billie Holiday and Alana Davis, if she'd ever recorded a loungey jazz album such as this. It's honestly unfair to compare her to anyone but herself, however. She's created a mold to call her own. Get used to her name. You'll be hearing it on the lips of all soon.
B000060OFT|5.0|Far from turning over in my grave upon the release of these modern works, I would be absolutely ecstatic to see leading edge filmmakers give new life and modern art treatment to my work.  In the past few years I have been stunned by the fantastic work being done by our top filmmaking talent using Shakespeare's underlying work.  Put Luhrmann in with that group with his version of \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" which is set in a turbulent, modern, violent world saturated by media influences.<br /><br />He doesn't deviate from the actual text of the play itself so the star crossed lovers' tale of a couple kept apart by their feuding families remains true to its core.  DiCaprio and Danes perform superbly.  Until \\"Titanic,\\" DiCaprio was not that well known and many of us were able to enjoy him in the edgier, chancier acting roles he took, like this one.  Personally, I prefer these new, modern film versions of the plays to the same plays performed traditionally on the stage and I have seen them that way.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00005QATY|4.0|I liked it really, when we rented it I was like &quot; I'm not going to watch it, no way.&quot; Then I watched for 5 seconds and couldn't stop watching it. It's interesting, not action-packed, it's humorous (not cracking up funny.) My type of of movie. (-:
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I already wrote a 5 star review of the film here so will not repeat my review comments.  I immediately bought the DVD when it came out and Luhrmann went the extra mile with the DVD in presenting the best special features I've experienced on a DVD.  There are extended dance sequences, interviews with virtually everyone involved in the film, an in-depth look at the creative process of writing the film, as done by Luhrmann and his co-author, his lifelong best friend, editorial choices showing the scenes kept versus scenes cut and more.  The extended tango number to \\"Roxanne\\" alone is worth the price of the entire DVD.<br /><br />I've read this was voted the best DVD of 2001 and it is extremely deserving of that honor.  You are also able to see the incredible differences between the actors in their real life personas and in their film personas.  Only Nicole Kidman would be recognizable in real life as a movie star.  McGregor, Broadbent and the actor playing the duke could blend into a crowd as anyone anywhere off camera.  The actor playing the duke especially is almost unrecognizable from the character he portrays in the film.  The metamorphosis that takes places on camera with these actors is incredible.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00005YU1O|5.0|This is a masterpiece.  At first it seems that the animation is merely an intro; however it carries on and sets a trippy mood.  The basic idea is Dreams Within Dreams.  Like a chocolate cake, Linklater must dig his way out of multiple layers of dreaming to finally wake.  <br />Along the way there is a ton of philosophy dealing with reality, fate, free will, divinity, and existence.  When will he finally awaken?  Not before passing through an almost hilariously heavy load of mysticism.  Characters levitate and light switches won't turn off, lending proof that, indeed, he is in a dream world.  The dialogue is very dense here; it almost feels like a book at times.  There are very controversial questions that many an intellectual may have asked him/herself at some time:  what comes after death?  Is life but a dream?  Do we have control over our destiny or is atomic physics in control of our decisions and our actions?  These heavy questions are sure to open up some mental floodgates.  <br />I found it hilarious that Linklater packed the film with dialogue relating to libertarianism.  Characters advocate free will throughout.  Angry political protesters complain about too much statism.  The animation moves about on the screen, suggesting hallucinogenic drug use.  And there is talk of using firearms to fight back against tyranny--one of the more revolutionary beliefs held by some modern libertarians.  If you share this ideology you'll be cheering and applauding in the theater like the audience did at my sitting.<br />If you like Kevin Smith this is a great choice.  If you want an original style film with almost no developed plot, you may vibe here.  If you have ever questioned reality or personal autonomy you will find out you're not alone.  And if you voted for Harry Browne in the last election I doubt you'll disagree with the political sentiment expressed by the people.<br />I have never seen the same shadow that this movie casts over its atmosphere.  Very unique and tending to raise issues; expect to leave the cinema inspired to pursue your dreams and ambitions in the real world.
B00005JKQX|3.0|I was disappointed that this movie did not tell the full story of John Nash. I read the biography, and it is so completely different than the movie. The film did give a realistic interpretation of mental illness, but it strayed from the facts too much for me. I did love Russell Crowe's performance, and he deserves the recognition that he is receiving for his acting performance. I just wish the script would have been more true to the facts.
B000031XCR|4.0|The album was overall wonderful and joyful to listen to. There are seven new songs all excellent beyond words. But there are some of Celine's best songs here State side missing - such as the big hit 'All By Myself' and 'Where Does My Heart Beat Now.' I can understand why Love Can Move Mountains is on the disc since it's the first R&amp;B top ten hit (can't remember if it was no. 1) by a female singer - correct that, a white female singer.  <br />My favorite of the new songs are<BR>That's the Way It Is<br />I Want You To Need Me<BR>The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face<BR>Then You Look At Me<BR>Live For the One I Love<br />...and the DVD version is wonderful too.
B00005JKED|5.0|It's the day before the Oscars, and I very much needed to rent this film, being a Denzel fan from way back, and I saw A BEAUTIFUL MIND and thought Crowe was swell. It's good to see Denzel playing a baddasss, because, with the exception of \\"Courage Under Fire\\", he'd always been maybe just a bit too perfect. This shows range & depth; truly a committed performance. The real star, though, is Ethan Hawke, who never really impressed me before. Putting him up against Denzel's brilliant performance is a true test of acting greatness. I'm sure this type of thing goes on in Police Dept's somewhere, and it's unnerving to think it does; I'm sure production would've been prevented if it hit too many true notes. The film is exciting, suspenseful, and the acting throughout is excellent. The DVD has a crisp 2.35:1 Widescreen, and characters portrayed by Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg are quite fine, proving other areas of talent. I'm impressed with this film, and I think Denzel should win the Oscar, as well as Hawke (though he won't, cuz he's the dark-horse...I hope I'm wrong...) Definitely see this film; it's unsettling and definitely a morality tale (where do you stop bending rules?) I was greatly entertained, and if you're a Denzel or Hawke fan, definitely SEE THIS FILM!! They are riveting!! DVD extras are plentiful.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Unbelievable that a movie like this can be produced on a tiny budget by today's standards and be as successful as it has been. Because of Chasing Amy and this one, I immediately became a Kevin Smith fan. I didn't like Dogma, though. Anyway, it's life at a convenience store... you'd think it'd be boring, but it's hilarious.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Mmmmmm, chocolaty good...this movie is delectable...a sweet little movie that I look forward to watching with that special someone...a fun, feel-good movie.  If you have an inclination toward metaphysics, you'll enjoy the sometimes subtle but lovely symbolism...it really tweaks the senses.  Perfect on a cold, snowy winter's night cuddling with your honey on the couch or, if solo, at least have a cup of hot chocolate. (Warning:  You'll want a big chunka' chocolate after this movie!)
B00005OAIE|5.0|My best friend, Hope turned me on to John Mayers' music, and I can't thank her enough...what a gift!! John Mayer is a huge talent, and I pray we see much more of him in the future.  And I'm sure if Elton John has his way, we will. (thank you Elton). Personally, I enjoy John's view on: dating, his uncertain future, his childhood, and so on. I myself grew up in that \\"83\\" era, so I enjoyed the nostalgia of the song. I find his songs very easy to relate too, and I think most poeple will feel the same, because he writes about life, in a very honest and pure way.  He's kind of like, the \\"Seinfeld\\" of songwriting, exposing the awkwardness, embarassments, curiosities, and fears we all have, but don't always express.  Well, he expresses them for us in \\"Room For Squares,\\" and beautifully...., I find his self deprecation, and modesty refreshing...such a nice change from the \\"in your face, look at me\\" [stuff] we see from the boy bands, and other bands of today. A song is a story put to music, and if done well...it creates a little movie in our heads.  John has done that in every song on this album, and done it very well.  Writing a GOOD song, is hard to do...I challenge ...to do as well as John did on this album. Or for that matter, anyone that thinks the lyrics aren't mature and developed. I have a lot of CDs in my collection, but few I can listen to all the way through without skipping over tracks.  This one I can.  I put it on repeat, and just let it go. There are only two types of songs on this CD...\\"Great, and Even Better.\\"  From the pop fun of, No Such Thing, to the edgy date experience of My Stupid Mouth, to the seductiveness of Your Body is a Wonderland, to the funkiness of City Love, and the catchy classic \\"missing you\\" feel of Back to You....and everything in between, John will take you on a memorable journey with that amazing voice of his...so do yourself a favor and let him.  John has the writing skills, the musical talent, and a voice that comes along once in a great long while.  He is the complete package.  And I plan on seeing the whole thing in concert very soon.I've talked this CD up to anybody that will listen, I dont recall the last time I came across a CD I felt that strongly about. This CD is worthy of that kind of solicitation. (Isn't it Elton?).  Please, buy this CD and enjoy.  As a songwriter myself, I hope I meet you someday John. Good luck!
0875847706|1.0|I have read many religious and secular self-help books, and hoped that this one might add new insight.  It didn't add much of it.  <br />Now, if you've read no self-help books and need some alternative perspectives from which to understand your situation, this book might help.  You will, however, have to take time with lengthy anecdotes that are not always very tightly related to the broader lesson of the particular chapter in which they appear.<br />You'll find similar lessons in many other self-help books, but usually presented more usefully and lucidly.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I quite like this cd.  But I must say, judging from the reviews that are either stroking or bashing the album, I must say that &quot;The Strokes&quot; are at least drawing attention to their work.  Most people here are intent on bashing their lack of creativity and their derivative nature...well, guess what?  All music's bloody derivative!  Everyone can be linked to someone else, so to solely bash a band based on their inability to be 'fresh' seems a bit unfair to me.  Besides, there's so only so many times I can listen to my Velvet Underground cds before I want to listen to something newer.  These people who are bashing The Strokes here seem like the same people who would be bashing BRMC or the White Stripes if they got this much media hype.  I think all three are great bands, but I don't think its possible to say one's more derivative than the other, because you could then call BRMC a brit rock cover band, and the White Stripes a cover band in general (how many of their riffs sound like they've been directly lifted from classic bands).  The one thing that the Strokes lack is variety, and I can see why some people are unimpressed in that respect, but then it becomes a matter of personal taste.  Basically, Last Nite and Hard to Explain give you a pretty good impression of what the album's about, so if you don't like those two songs, this is not an album for you.  Still though, you can't give someone a bad review because of hype, which I feel many people here are doing.
B00005JKQX|5.0|...A BEAUTIFUL MIND is really a fine film, well put-together and a riveting narrative. It's detractors have criticized it for not being true to Nash's real life... WHO CARES!!!? The film, as presented, is as good as I've seen in a long time. Certainly, there were things in this complicated man's life that had to be left out for the sake of narrative. Some sensation-seekers are upset because his homosexuality wasn't addressed, though I thought the relationship with his roommate was more than platonic...I don't want to give away any plot points...and besides that...WHO CARES!!? I enjoyed the film, as presented... I really liked James Horner's score. It was exceptionally pretty. The score presented Nash's moods as much as Russell did...
B00003CXPD|4.0|If successful films made money for their locales, northern England would be rolling in it: Little Voice, Brassed Off, The Full Monty, Chicken Run, and \\"Billy Elliot\\" (aka Little Dancer). This movie has a similar background of mining communities and strikes, but the \\"odd man out\\" is even more out of step with everyone else: a boy who prefers ballet to boxing, and his friend who wears his sister's dresses when she's out. I enjoyed this movie enough to buy the DVD. Several scenes stick in my memory: a pillow fight between Billy and his ballet teacher's daughter, full of pubescent sexual tension; and Billy's dad, turned \\"scab\\" to pay for Billy's ballet career, riding the police-guarded bus through the picket lines; and Billy and his teacher dancing in the gym. <br />The tension in Billy himself between his environment's \\"boys don't do ballet\\" attitudes and his own love of dancing is nicely played out. I felt everyone came around to a supportive position a little too easily and predictably, like, \\"Come on, there's only a 30 minutes of this movie left, so we better gather round and drop all the negativity\\", but that may be a comment on the editing rather than the acting or direction. The colours and photography were great, tho the winter scenes were so completely unconvincing it was funny! And Jamie Bell himself is brilliant - his acting even more than his dancing. This is an interesting story, about the difficulty of growing up without a mother, about breaking social and sexual expectations; it is NOT a movie about miners or politics. Too bad about the swearing, which, like \\"Little Voice\\" makes me hesitant to heartily recommend this movie for kids, who would otherwise enjoy it.
0880389052|5.0|the biggest problem with this book is it's marketed to only fantasy, and d&amp;d fans. These books are and will be classics. The depth and imagry, charecers and conflicts are incredible. Don't hesitate, get this book, and the other 2.. you'll want them by the time you've finished this one.
B00005QZWI|5.0|As a fan of the book and movie, I might be a little biased, but I love this soundtrack.  It's hard to do anything but sit down and listen to the cd once you start playing it.  Enjoy!
B000000OQF|5.0|During the first few moments of &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot; you can almost anticipate what this album is going to be like. From the police siren scream by Axl on Jungle to the very last solo on &quot;Rocket Queen&quot; this album packsa powerful punch throughout. The two guitar tandem of Izzy Stradlin and Slash rips out riffs better than almost anybody and bassist Duff Mckagan and Drummer Steve Adler keep the groove going throughout as Axl tells tales of the big city life. This is a fantastic album by any standard but the fact that it was their debut doubles its greatness. Standout Tracks like &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot;,&quot;Paradise City&quot; and &quot;My Michelle&quot; have killer hooks riffs and lyrics. This is a must buy. Too bad this band couldn't have made more music like this.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|I recently picked up a copy of Session 9, and I must say this is one film that had me turning lights on to reach my bedroom at night.  <BR>The story focuses on an abandon mental institution and the 5 men tasked to complete an asbestos job within a week period.  As the story progresses one of the men stumbles upon a series of session tapes left from the 1980s before the institution had closed.  These tapes review a psychiatrist and a female patient's sessions on her split personalities and past sexual (satanic) abuse as a child.  These sessions bring madness to the 5 men working day to day to complete thier job.  This film will keep you guessing til the end. Do these sessions play a supernatural role or do the men and ourselves just let imaginations run wild.  <BR>I guarantee the ending is pretty startling.  If you enjoyed the Blair Witch Project \\"plot\\" (not the crazy \\"make you sick\\" camera work),  then you will enjoy this film.  <BR>Session 9 does not contain a weak \\"flavor of the week MTV metal band\\" soundtrack.  Nor does it contain a stupid serial killer running around in a mask hunting down top heavy women.  Those type of films are \\"not scary\\".  This is.  Especially if you are tired of seeing women as the victims.  If you rent this movie please rent the DVD for the extras (especially the deleted scenes).  These scenes give you a little more to the story that you might not know when watching it the first time.  I must say I will add it to my collection soon.
B00005O5JV|5.0|Legally Blonde is an amazing comedy worth being watched atleast 3 times!  Reese Witherspoon is amazing and does her acting talents to the fullest.  She plays Elle Woods, a girl who was dumped ny her boyfriend because she was too blonde and therefore dumb.  Her boyfriend goes to Harvard Law School, so she also goes there to make an attempt to get him back...A very funny and entertaining film that can be watched many times by the whole family.  I hope this review was helpful to you!<BR>Note: This text refers to the DVD version.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I saw A.I. in the movie theaters and was very disappointed.  I think I expected more whimsy (like the classic E.T.).  Perhaps the misleading marketing of A.I. led me down the wrong road.<br />After viewing the film a second time on DVD, I have a completely different reaction.  I absolutely love A.I. and consider it one of Spielberg's best.  (I loved EMPIRE OF THE SUN too ...)<br />So why the big difference between viewings? One reason is that A.I. is a dense film - you can't catch all the different layers of story and theme on the first viewing.  Spielberg has created a modern fable that, like most classic fairy tales, has a dark side.  The Grimm Brothers' tales had some macabre elements.  The best Disney films are scary and pyschological as well.<br />Emotionally, I was very moved by A.I.  Spielberg has told a tale that confronts some basic human existential questions: how long does love last?  When will our parents die?  And, most importantly, what is the nature of love?  David, the \\"artificial intelligence\\", is a robotic boy.  He exists to fill the emotional void for a childless couple.  However, what do the couple owe him in return for his love?  What is their responsibility?  Can they return him to the manufacturing plant?<BR>Can you love a machine?  <br />A.I. is a fascinating film with incredible special effects.  The story is very human and its emotions are universal.
B00005RY7X|3.0|It is hard to digest this processed metal \\"cheese\\". The name \\"Andrew Wk\\" for this band was a poor choice, it should have been called something more memorable.  Never the less, it is good to hear something new that actually SOUNDS METAL (with all of the neo-metal acts these days that basically just sound like bad white guy rap with distorted guitars). This music sounds as if someone threw Twisted Sister, Slayer, The Go-Gos, and The Sweet into a processor and viola! I suppose you could call it retroish, with the Pyromania style group vocals. The use of synths and piano seems to work. Mind you, it's not really original or anything, and lyrics are absolutely ridiculous. (I'm talking old Kiss dumb). This is just a blast the pop-metal energy that's been sadly absent from the \\"infected\\" Kid Rock/Creed/Korn/Bizkit metal scene that somehow passes itself off as marketable to teens nowadays. Will this be the band that starts a old skool metal comeback? Nah, probably not- the genre is doomed.
0195067142|5.0|This book by E. B. Sedge USMC veteran of WWII Pacific War is the Best, Most Profound, and Important Description of the War Experience ever written.  It is highly readable.  The reader sees the images, imagines the odors and feels the emotions; critical for a description of war.<br />How do men survive this environment?  They don't.  Even if they do not suffer physical injury they all psychologically suffer terribly.  To quote from the book, \\"War is brutish, inglorious and a terrible waste.  Combat leaves an indelible mark on those who are forced to endure it.  The only redeeming factors were my comrades' incredible bravery and their devotion to each other.\\" ... \\"Until the millennium arrives and countries cease trying to enslave others, it will be necessary to accept one's responsibilities and be willing to make sacrifices for one's country - as my comrades did.  As the troops use to say, `If the country is good enough to live in, it's good enough to fight for'.  With privileges goes responsibilities.\\"  (page 315, paperback edition).  Does this quote sounds like a clich&eacute;?  It is not.  The quote is heart felt and real.<br />While we as individuals may or may not agree with the diplomatic and military policies of our country, we must never, never give anything but respect, honor and compassion to the members of this country's armed forces when we as a country ask them to go into harm's way for us.  The book explains why.
B000002UAO|5.0|This album is the \\"halfway there\\" album. The Beatles still had love songs, but they were more artisitc than their other albums. Songs like \\"Michelle\\" and \\"Girl\\" showed they could still write love songs, but with intresting guitar lines and hooks. The keepers on this is..well, all of them! Maybe I could do without \\"Drive My Car,\\" but they're all good. \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is one of my favorites. The first folk song with a sitar. Also, \\"Nowhere Man\\" is my favorite on the album. Nice guitar solo, and good use of weird chords. I love the video in Yellow Submarine. That's an A flat in the chorus. Also, George gets some good tunes. \\"Think For Yourself,\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone.\\" Also, Ringo gets a tune. \\"What Goes On,\\" which has a good Western feel. But what the [heck] is with \\"Run For Your Life\\"? That's one of those \\"I'll kill you if you're with another man\\" songs. Weird! Anyway, this is a great album. Bye.
0790736039|3.0|Stephen King's IT is a so-called horror movie about an unknown evil that takes the form of a terrible clown named Pennywise and murders children. A group of neighborhood kids battle the evil and send him back to hell... or so they think. The clown shows up again some 30 years later and begins his terror again. So the group who defeated IT before returns to kill it once and for all. I've seen this movie twice and it hasn't scared me at all. Why? Maybe because it's long and dragged out. Only a few good scenes exist but they are hardley scary. The good thing about this movie was Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise. The movie could have been better and scarier. The ending was terrible and I was dissapointed with it. This movie fails to deliver the necessary elements for a horror film. The book on the other hand is more interesting. Buy this movie if you feel like having a laugh at Pennywise or if you're actually afraid of clowns. If you're looking for a good horror film, Stephen King's IT won't be the one.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney's 3rd album is her best album yet. I Think everyone should own this album. \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" is great, \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\" is a good song. my personal favorite song on this album is \\"Let Me Be\\", as if you didn't know Britney wrote 5 songs on the album. The tracks that I listen to more are \\" I'm A slave 4 U,\\" \\"Lonely\\" \\"Boys\\" \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll,\\" and the new single \\"Overprotected.\\" GO GET THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|The original thriller Donnie Darko brilliantly tells a tale of psychosis, bravery and sacrifice, wrapped up in a story of a compelling sci-fi styled mystery. Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is given a four week head's up of the impending doom for Earth. His imaginary friend Frank lets him know, he's the 6 feet tall terrifying monster bunny in the mirror that no one but Donnie can see.  Even though he's heavily medicated, in therapy, and risking the wrath of his family, Donnie takes Frank the Bunny's advice unconditionally.  He feels he owes it to Frank, he saved his life after all.  His first piece of advice proved dead on, to leave his home in the middle of the night, which prevents Donnie from of all things, being smooshed by a giant jet engine which falls mysteriously to earth and crashes into his bedroom.  Now the troubled Donnie must cope with his secret and very scary friend taking him on eerie and fateful sleepwalking adventures, his troubles with his family and school, and dealing with growing feelings for a girl with her own set of problems, Gretchen, (jena malone) whose Mom is in the witness protection program. The film is imaginative, intelligent, well acted, challenging and thoroughly original.  Gyllenhaal underplays Donnie's mental problems which makes it all the more unnerving and hypnotic to watch.  I can't believe I missed it in the theater, word of mouth now that it's out on DVD and Video is this film's best friend, I cannot recommend it enough!
0748662529|5.0|Political upheaval, false appearances, and a variety of complicated parental and male/female relationships are expertly crafted into the plot of Alexander McCall Smith?s, The No. 1 Ladies Detective.  Alexander McCall Smith places Precious Ramotswe in an  environment that responds suspiciously towards women who reject the culturally accepted maternal role.  Precious is presented as a successful detective not because of her educational background but instead because of her intuition, common sense, and easy was of interacting with people.  Precious Ramotswe handles clients and criminals effectively using a light and sometimes comical manner.  Through her work, she enables herself and other women to question their role as women in this society and within the traditional family structure.  Precious helps support several of her clients as they stand up to tyrannical male figures.  Ramotswe appears most entertaining when interacting with more traditional male characters.  Her understanding of the traditional male view of her life and their assumptions of her intelligence allow her to create situations in which the male characters demonstrate their own stupidity.  Precious Ramotswe?s life and role in the novel allow her to witness and explore a variety of relationships between male and female characters.  Ramotswe seems most admirable for her personal strength and her knowledge of what she wants from her own relationships.  These characteristics identify her as a powerful figure who is capable of setting her own guidelines concerning her role in this community and in her intimate relationships.
6304140711|5.0|This was one of the best B-movies I have ever seen I thought it was great!
B00005JKL8|1.0|I don't ordinarily write reviews, but even as a straight-up action movie this was so horrible, such an insulting waste that I feel compelled to discourage you from seeing it.<br />Owen Wilson is a good actor but does not fit here at all; he comes across more as a goofy weakling than a determined adventure-seeker.  Humor often falls flat.  Almost all of the characters are one-dimensional, but of course this is intended as just an action movie... with below-average action sequences.  Yes, even the action sequences are poorly done, with wildly overused and almost nauseating handheld shots and an expressionless villain who's ultimately just \\"silly\\".  The mine field and final action scenes in particular reminded me of the Rambo scene from \\"UHF\\" (the phrase \\"I'm huntin' wabbits!\\" suits to describe the suspense of the chase).  The only two bright points included a convincing but unoriginal Gene Hackman commander and a fighter jet sequence early on, which is actually very well done.<br />Please do yourself a favor and don't support work like this, a mockery to the very serious concept of genocide.  They'll only make more like it if you do.
1558908382|5.0|I can usually bank on John Cusack - &quot;The Grifters&quot;, &quot;The Sure Thing&quot;, &quot;Say Anything&quot;, &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, &quot;Being John Malkovitch&quot; - try to forget about &quot;Pushing Tin&quot; and some others.  The same is true about Jeremy Piven (see him as the cashier in &quot;Singles&quot;).  I was concerned, however, about Dan Ackroyd.  He was actually very funny in this as the Grocer.  Buy this movie.
B00003CXB2|4.0|I received this DVD for my birthday and had never seen this film before.  I'd seen it re-released in the UK the previous year but wasn't overly inclined to spend money on it, and was therefore strangely pleased to have received this as a gift.  I then waited until the following Saturday to sit down and watch this in it's entirety - it's 218 minutes long split over two discs, so make the time to watch this.  I hate watching films in parts, it's all or nothing with me.<br />The first thing that struck me was the cast list.  Peter O'Toole, although the lead in this film, was the last cast name to appear.  This was undoubtedly due to the fact that he was a relative unknown at the time while the other stars, bar Omar Sharif, were already big stars.  Of course, the release of this film changed this for both O'Toole and Sharif.<br />It must be said that the cinematography is really what makes this film.  It is simply stunning and I doubt a desert has ever looked as good and sumptuous as it does here.  There are some gorgeous panoramic shots with characters appearing either at mid-point in the shot or way back in the distance.  Part of the quality here owes much to the restoration of the print back in 1989 by Steven Spielberg amongst others, and some of the dialogue was actually re-recorded at the same time.  Even the internal shots are full of detail that put a lot of modern films to shame.<br />While the cinematography is undoubtedly impressive, it is enhanced by a sweeping score by Maurice Jarre.  The music has an epic quality that is both stirring and atmospheric.  The main themes do tend to repeat quite a lot, but what would you really expect for a film over 3 hours long?  An interesting angle on the score is shown on the DVD.  The first few minutes of both parts of the film are just the music with a black screen.  This apparently is as Lean originally envisaged it.  This did initially make me a bit impatient for the film to start, but I soon found myself immersed in the music.<br />Peter O'Toole does a fantastic job of playing TE Lawrence, a famous enigma in British history.  This is definitely not just your normal square jawed hero who is perfect, Lawrence undergoes some radical character changes that hint at the partial loss of sanity due to his experiences.  The film is also clearly about his life and experiences rather than just the action adventure aspect of this period of his life.  Therefore there is relatively little real action, which is left mainly to the imagination, and the film focuses most of it's attention on his actions and emotional state of mind, and the high regard felt for him by his Persian friends.<br />Omar Sharif is well cast as the closest thing Lawrence has to a friend, and his introduction via a long distance shot of just a black blip to a half height shot (head to waist) is just fantastic - you'll never see such shots these days.  Anthony Quinn and Alec Guiness are also excellent, although their make-up looks a little dated now - as does O'Toole's eye-liner which does help give him the look of a deranged man at times.<br />There are some good extras here, but bearing in mind that this film is close to 40 years old, it is fitting that most of them (in numberrather than time) are from the original period of this films release.  The modern extras are a long documentary on the making of the film and it's restoration and a \\"conversation\\" with Steven Spielberg about this films influence on him.  The \\"old\\" extras consist of the original trailer (approx. 5 minutes long!), very dark footage of the New York premiere and five on location short films that include a piece on the casting of camels and locals as extras.  Another impressive extra is a map that you can \\"walk\\" around and get more detail on what Lawrence achieved and look at some original photographs courtesy of the Imperial War Museum.<br />David Lean has truly created one of the cinematic masterpieces of the 20th Century - many would like to claim this dubious honour for their favourite films, this time it is emphatically undeniable.  This is not a film, this is an experience.
B000000993|5.0|Tool has changed from their first album \\"Opiate\\" and created something out of this world and something from your own imagination. The songs of this album affect you in a pshyciatric level and you are bound to keep listening. \\"Intolerance\\" Starts off the album. A nice intro to the album. \\"Prison Sex and Sober\\" are the songs that keep this album alive. \\"Prison Sex\\" has good alternative guitar riffs and \\"Sober\\" gives you the power to listen for more. \\"Bottom\\" is a good song with a nice chorus line. The songs \\"Crawl Away and Swamp Song\\" become the darkness to the album. \\"Undertow\\" is the last main part of the album and then you listen closly to the supernatural side with the last 3 tracks. Undertow is one great album and a good opening to Tool's imagination.

0792151712|3.0|James Cameron is best known for directing such action slash science fiction classics as The Terminator (1984) and Aliens (1986). As a result a love story between an<BR>upper class women Rose (Kate Winslet) and a lower class free spirit Jake (Leonardo DiCaprio) constructed around the sinking of a the supposedly \\"unsinkable\\" ship in<BR>1912 could be seen as a change of pace. It is a change of pace which works, albeit it not completely.<BR> The story of the Titanic is a very familiar one and has developed its own mythology.<BR>Cameron allows one character to helpfully outline what happened on that fateful night and thus allows the viewer to concentrate upon the love story between the star<BR>crossed lovers  instead of worrying about the sinking of the ship. There is also asubplot about the fiancee of Rose Cal (Billy Zane) and henchman Lovejoy (David Warner) trying to prevent the lovers from being together.<BR> Titanic really is a return to the old fashioned epics that Hollywood used to make. The film is at it best when it is concentrating upon the recreation of the microcosm of<BR>Edwardian society that Titanic was and the actual sinking of the boat. Unfortunately Cameron is not as good a writter as a director and the dialogue is often risible. Saying that though Cameron manages, like Neil Jordan in Interview with a Vampire (1994), to create some memorable set pieces, for example, when Jake and Rose descend in tothe engine room of the ship it resembles hell with the red of the flames or seeing the<BR>bodies of dead people in the first class accommodation and of course of sinking of the ship. He also manages to convey the sheer terror the people must have felt as the ship<BR>sank.<BR> The performances are merely adequate though Warner as Cal's villainous henchmen gives an enjoyable performance. Saying that though the actors and actresses are merely there to show case the special effects. They are mostly excellent though some<BR>have aged badly. As an amalgam of a love story and a disaster movie it is not bad.When Cameron moves on to politics it flounders badly and he is on much more shaky ground. <BR> The film was hyped a lot and it possibly did not deserve the shed loads of Oscars it got. It is not one of the best films of the 90s or even the year it was made, but it is not<BR>bad. The scale of the film making which Cameron has made is similar to the films which Cecil De Mille was making and for that he is to be applauded. Titanic is not innovative, but it is not meant to be new and within the narrow parameters it sets for<BR>itself it works.
B000001Y5J|4.0|I'm not sure what the hell Trent Reznor was thinking when he got off the road promoting 'Pretty Hate Machine', but with this 8 song EP (6 songs are listed, 2 tracks are \\"hidden\\") I'm not sure I'm in any hurry to find out.<br />'Broken' was easily the noisiest, and most irritating record I had ever heard back when I first heard it, and for good reason. It's full of noise, and layered textures. Thankfully the EP grew on me, and I was able to see the brilliance of the mind of Trent Reznor.

B00004XPP0|5.0|Star Wars is beyond a normal movie, its so good it trasports you to another time and place.  I didn't know really anything about star wars as a kid living the the 80's.  It wasn't until I grew up and was in my teenage years that I really took to the galaxy far, far away.  Now I'm a huge fan and can't wait to see the trilogy fully completed.  These films changed hollywood forever(you could debate forever if it was for the good or bad).  One thing is for sure at one point in everybodys life we've all felt like Luke Skywalker longing to be are own person!!!! Long live the galaxy far, far away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0140071202|5.0|Though this edition of Dickens' great &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is not a reprint of the original book form of the work (or indeed, even from the nineteenth century), it feels as if it is.<br />The text is well presented in a old-ffashioned manner, and the illustrations represent various scenes from the book in appropriately good-humored fashion.<br />If you don't mind paying a little more for a finer product, this edition of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is worth further investigation.
B00005NWM3|1.0|...Alternative music is starting to sound like one band is making all the music and changing their name. If you like wannabe hardcore with fake riffs right after the corus go out and buy the album. if you want cliched life's so bad lyrics buy the album. if you want good, pure, non-comercial music, don't.
B00005OAE6|5.0|If I were to compile my Top 100 all-time favourite albums, then this Bob Seger effort would definitely appear in the upper echelons of that chart. Sadly, Bob Seger never received the recognition he deserved for this, or any other album he released in the UK, so chances are most people don't know much about the man who was running head-to-head (Stateside) in the popularity stakes with Bruce Springsteen in his pre-&quot;Born In The USA&quot; days.<br />If people compared Seger to Springsteen, &quot;Stranger In Town&quot; likened Seger to the Eagles. The music on this CD was maybe not as 'country rock' as the latter was better known for, but it's certainly similar in style and in mood - qualities that saw Seger guest appear with the Eagles on tour in the 70s. In other words, &quot;Stranger In Town&quot; typifies the musical genre known as 'middle of the road'.<br />Quite remarkably for a studio album - and I don't normally say this except for a 'greatest hits' collection - there aren't any substandard tracks on this CD. It's a rather short album, but the nine songs featured have stood well against the test of time - and are all bona-fide 'classics' on your favourite 'easy listening' radio station.<br />'Hollywood Nights' kicks off the CD - a track taken from the same musical mould that produced The Eagles' 'Life In The Fast Lane' - a tale of living the high life in 70s California. Other upbeat radio-friendly rock tracks follow with (the classic) 'Old Time Rock And Roll', 'Feels Like A Number' (another Eagles-like song) and 'Ain't Got No Money'. <br />But it's the ballads that really make this album. 'Still The Same', 'Till It Shines' and 'Brave Strangers' were all destined to elevate Bob Seger into the mainstream. However, there's two tracks that should've elevated Seger into superstardom. 'We've Got Tonight' - probably the best known song on the CD - is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful ballads I've ever had the pleasure to listen to. With all it's heart-wrenching emotion, sung and performed to such perfection, it seems almost blasphemous to listen to any of the countless - and let me say, inferior cover versions that have been recorded over the years. <br />My own personal favourite track on &quot;Stranger In Town&quot; is the one used to end the album. 'The Famous Final Scene' - a song about the end of a relationship - ranks alongside Meat Loaf's 'For Crying Out Loud' as one of the most thought-provoking ballads that will tug at the heart-strings of even the most cold-hearted person on the planet. And the last few seconds of the song are guaranteed to send a shiver down your spine!<br />The Eagles had their &quot;Hotel California&quot;, Springsteen had his &quot;Born To Run&quot;. For Bob Seger, his definitive studio album was &quot;Stranger In Town&quot;. Forget about his 'Greatest Hits' CD - a collection that didn't do the man justice - if you want to hear the real talent behind this criminally ignored artist, then this is the album you need to buy. I promise you won't regret it.<br />Jon.

B00003CXXP|5.0|I just saw this film for the first time last night, (beautiful DVD), and I'm still thinking about it.  I think that BRYAN FROM CONCORD pretty much summed up my feelings in his review.<br />Bottom line for me is, this is an entertaining film that stirs the imagination and makes you think.<br />In my book, that's a GREAT film!
B0000027RL|5.0|When I looked at spin magazine's list of 50 greatest bands of all time, it said that Pearl Jam's classic album is Vitalogy. I would like to say that Vitalogy is one of the [worst] albums I've heard in a long time. Ten is like 15 times better than Vitalogy. Spin magazine don't know what ... their talking about. This is one of the best albums of the 90's. It's full of lively songs with great guitar solos and vocals. Vitalogy contains [bad] guitar riffs, no solos bad vocals and lyrics, oh what the [heck], the album [stinks] major time.<BR>Ten is just phenomanal. It really showed how talented these dudes really are. It's just too bad they wasted all of it on [bad] albums like Vitalogy and Yield. So if you love grunge and you don't have this outstanding album, you need someone to give you a swift kick in the [butt].
B0000032LS|5.0|Almost thirty years since the music of the film first saw the light of day, the soundtrack from &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; is quite possibly the best sing-along soundtrack album ever. I mean, is there anyone in the world who hasn't heard such timeless classics as &quot;Time Warp&quot; or &quot;Sweet Transvestite&quot;? <br />This isn't an album that'll appeal to everyone - some of the tracks are pretty naff, but that's part of the fun of &quot;Rocky Horror..&quot;. The only regret about this CD is it doesn't include the lovely ballad &quot;Once In A While&quot; (which was, incidentally, cut from the film). In my opinion, that was one of the best songs. Never mind, you still have a great album here, but you really need to see the movie to fully enjoy it.<br />Jon.
0792156684|4.0|So much has been said about this amazing achievement in film, it's difficult to come up with any new insights as to why it touched so many people.  To be sure, Leonardo and Kate shine, the story involves one of the world's foremost tragedies, and the visual splendor of the film remains unchallenged.  Perhaps the best endorsement I can make however, is that it speaks a universal language - I took my Cuban born mother to see it when it opened.  She doesn't speak English, but was immediately wrapped up in the film, so much so that she was one of the first to cheer it at the end.  That speaks volumes - despite the language obstacle, here was a 65 year old woman who enjoyed the film from its opening scene right through the end.   To me, that alone makes &quot;Titanic&quot; a triumph.
0887306667|1.0|This collection of anecdotes and contradictory &quot;laws&quot; is probably the worst marketing book I have ever read.  The only so-called law that Ries and Trout have provided ample evidence to support is the &quot;law of hype,&quot; which says that the more a product is hyped the more likely it is to be a dud.  The 17 executives in the front of the book who were somehow cajoled into hyping it certainly supports the theory.  The only way they could honestly say this was the &quot;best marketing book&quot; they ever read was if it was the ONLY marketing book they ever read.
B0000028M7|5.0|First of all, I would like to say say that this is one of the greatest hard rock albums in the history of rock music. This is a work of art. This album is worth buying just for &quot;Down in a hole&quot; on its own, a brilliant soft song with great harmonising. If I could, I would give this C.D all the stars in the world.<br />If you like Dirt, I would also recommend Pearl Jam &quot;Ten&quot; (sadly their only great album), Nirvana's Nevermind and In Utero and Soundgarden's Bad motorfinger for all you grunge lovers, some of the greatest bands of the whole Seattle scene, my hometown.
B000001FDK|5.0|If \\"Grease\\" was meant to be a movie based in the 50s, why are there very little traditional rock'n'roll style tracks on this album? Ah, who care ?!! This soundtrack is simply a joy to listen to. Take away the fact most of the songs are cheesey and corny, what you have is an album that makes you feel good.<br />Some tracks are more well-known than others, but is there anyone living in the Western world that doesn't know the words to these songs? And even if you don't, how many of you have added your own words and ju sung along to the tracks anyway?! <br />The highlights? Frankie Valli's \\"Grease\\" captures the 70s 'disco' sound perfectly, so it won't come as a surprise to discover this was written by one of the Bee-Gees. \\"Summer Nights, \\"You're The One That I Want\\", \\"Greased Lightning\\", \\"Hoplessly Devoted To You\\" and \\"Sandy\\" are all as popular today as they were 23 years ago.<br />But there are a few hidden gems to be found as album fillers, most noteably the contributions from the 'real' 1960s group 'Sha-Na-Na'. Tracks including: \\"Born To Hand Jive\\", \\"Tears On My Pillow\\", \\"Those Magic Changes\\" and \\"Blue Moon\\" prove it's unfair to associate the \\"Grease\\" soundtrack CD only with John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Also, Stockard Channing's \\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\\" also deserves a mention too.<br />Any naff songs? Yeah, but just a few. \\"Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee\\" reeks of 'naffness'(!), but on this soundtrack CD, the good outweigh the bad.<br />I first bought this soundtrack in the early 80s on vinyl (remember lp's?) and twice on audio cassette years later. Now I have two \\"Grease\\" CD's (inc. the 20th Anniversary Edition with CD-Rom). Now, if that isn't a recommendation you buy it, I don't know what is! <br />Just avoid anything associated with \\"Grease 2\\"!!!!<br />Jon:)
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This film was recommended to me by a friend, and ever since I've watched it I can't get it out of my mind.  The whole film was a rollercoaster, ups and downs of life, but how severe the downs are for Harry and Marian.  The character of Sarah Goldfarb took the message even further as it's shown how even the innocent can be destroyed by what starts out as simple as diet pills.   If this movie doesn't give you a few reasons to be clean, i don't know what would. Truly an amazing film, hasn't left my DVD player or mind since I first got it.  Buy it, watch it, love it.
6304806434|5.0|It seems like action movies have been appearing less and less in the last few years, and people are watching more chick flicks and \\"smart\\" films. Hollywood believes that only women watch movies anymore - but that's just not true.<br />Us regular guys need a good action movie, and Con Air is one of the best. This film is really underrated for dead-on casting and great special effects. The great musical score and star lineup make this really stand out. Explosions, and great comedy bits make this a highly rewatchable movie. Dave Chapelle, Colm Meaney, Steve Buscemi, and M.C. Gainey steal the scenes.<br />As far as action movies go, it's hard to find a fault with this movie. My only nitpick would be that it's hard to really believe Cage's southern accent. It easily tops other similar movies like Armageddon, Face/Off, and The Rock. You can't go wrong - watch it!<br />Remember to look for former NHL badboy Marty McSorley - hint: he's in the cockpit.
B00005OAIE|4.0|...As a college student I can relate to the lyrics, although they might not be as deep and meaningful as some, they are real. Even though \\"My stupid mouth\\" may not be some of his best work, and he maybe sounds a little too close to Dave Matthews...I think that his talent is obvious.  I've listened to the CD inside and out for the last few weeks and each time \\"St. Patrick's Day\\" is over I feel satisfied, yet I want more. This album is a great start for John Mayer and I look forward to even better from him in the future
B00005OM4N|2.0|Even though I don't really like Britney Spears' first two albums they are definitely better than this! Well, sure there are a \\"couple\\" of good songs but the rest are eckk...<BR>1. I'm A Slave 4 U (2/10)This song's beats really [stink] and the lyrics do too.<BR>2. Overprotected (9/10)Most people can relate to this song, the music's pretty good and the lyrics don't [stink].<BR>3. Lonely (6/10)She was doing fine until she started sounding like Willa Ford.<BR>4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (7/10)Great ballad but she's too breathy in this one. Someone's trying to copy Mandy Moore's breathy toon.<BR>5. Boys (1/10)Sounds like music that a stripper would dance to.<BR>6. Anticipating (6/10)A little bit too dancy but better than most of the tracks.<BR>7. I Love Rock 'n' Roll (4/10)This is the worst remake I've ever heard.<BR>8. Cinderella (2/10)The music and the beats are bad. Did I mention the lyrics?<BR>9.

VERY BADD!<BR>12. What It's Like To Be Me (2/10)Sounds like a crappy remake of \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\"
B000002WPI|5.0|Alright, ya'll.  This album is kickin.  If you do not have this album, you do not know what hip-hop really is.  This is the album that started it all.  It introduced the RZA, the GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, Raekwon the Chef, U-God, Ghostface Killah and Method Man to the world.  Masta Killah makes his appearance as well.  This is a definate must for anyone who listens to hip-hop music.  The beats are tight.  There is not one song you will be dissappointed with.  I bought it when it first came out and have listened to it over and over again ever since.  It takes quite an album to get me to do that.  Take it from this DJ, get this album.  You really will be happy with yourself for buying it.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is the greatest movie ever made. True, much of it is clich and sentimental, but as for me, I like that kind of movie. The story isn't exactly the most accurate of history films and so I would not advise seeing this movie for the history. This is a very romantic movie that centers on true love. The story opens on two young boys growing up together in post-depression Tennessee. These two young boys are later introduced as Rafe and Danny, best friends since childhood. The movie then speeds up to 1940, where Rafe has found the love of his life, the beautiful and coy nurse Evelyn, and he and Danny are training to become pilots in the army. Matters between Danny, Rafe and Evelyn become more complicated when Rafe's request to be stationed in England is granted. <BR>As I said, this is a great movie for all of you romance-lovers. About 1 hour centers on the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the special effects are magnificent. If you ask me, I think this is a much better and well-put together movie than Titanic.
B000002LN9|5.0|The only thing that matters in the entire universe is this record's version of Old Love. Second to that, or perhaps third, is this same record's version of Wonderful Tonight.
B000002KZ6|5.0|Released in 1983, 'Speaking In Tongues' is Talking Heads in their most creative and purest form. With Brian Eno gone from the producer's seat, the band could really project their sound without his \\"meddling.\\" This also marks where David Byrne started to take control (luckily Speaking In Tongues is a full cohesive band effort, not a Byrne solo project).<BR>Opening with the big hit 'Burning Down The House,' we have one of the best albums in the past 20 years. The dancy and quirky 'Making Flippy Floppy' and 'Girlfriend Is Better' to the bass-heavy boogie of 'Swamp' make this the Heads' overall best effort (with 'Remain In Light' coming in a close second). Very cohesive and pure effort from one of New York's best.
B00003CXI1|4.0|In this adaptation of J.K. Rowling's acclaimed \\"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone,\\" Chris Colombus put together a great movie that any fan of the books will love. I was a bit skeptical about seeing this film because I thought that the movie would be done poorly and that I wouldn't end up liking it. I ended up enjoying a lot. Chris Colombus stayed right with the book and didn't change a thing. Never have I seen a director that was making a film out of a book keep the film so real to the original novel. Colombus had some skill to do this movie with such beauty.<br /> The actors chosen for this film were great. I had imagined every character from Harry himself to Hermione all the way to Albus Dumbledore. Each of the actors did such a great job that I am sadenned to see that this film was not nominated for many Academy Awards. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were adroable and no other kids could have done as good as a job as they did. The castle chosen as Hogwarts was great and presented the witchcraft and wizardry school very well. <br /> This movie serves the book very well and most Harry Potter fans will be very pleased with this. I recommend that you pre-order this DVD so you will be able to watch it when it comes out. Everything in this film was done very well and it seemed like the movie was being played off of Rowling's book. Check this movie out; you'll enjoy it!!!<br />Happy Viewing!!!
0780624890|5.0|Truly one of the best SuperHero action flicks I've ever seen.  It was a sleeper hit in the theatres, and most of it's fan base was developed when it dropped on DVD.  That doesn't change the fact that it's one of the best action movies out there.  Snipes is definitely the man doing all his own fighting.  Being a 5th level black belt, he coreographed most of the fight scenes, and they came out beautifully.  I've loved this film since I saw it in theatres, and I still love it on DVD.  A definite must buy!
B000002WAD|5.0|This Album just makes me want to get up and Dance!  Every song has an upbeat tone and you never want it to end.  It is so much better than todays pop acts.
B00005JKED|4.0|Training Day takes a couple of interesting risks, the most significant is its undermining the now-stale formula of the interracial buddy bonding movie, used to great commercial success in films like the Lethal Weapon series. (One can immediately envision hordes of studio execs perusing the Training Day script and firing off hasty notes to the producer asking how they can sell the film if Washington and Hawke aren't riding off into the sunset together at the end.) Training Day, of course, is going for something grittier, but only partly succeeds. The plotting, unfortunately, still falls prey to hackneyed contrivances and coincidences required to push through to a pat resolution, just the sort of artifice that would be typical of a buddy movie, but here seriously undermines the authenticity that Training Day strives for. We overlook that due to Washington's performance, a body slam of arrogant bravado that's mesmerizing to watch. Washington plays a crooked cop who reasons with all the guile of a pimp, putting more spin on the dialogue than a pool hustler on a cue ball. Washington keeps the film afloat and full of surprise.
B000000H4V|5.0|Chaos A.D. is emotional, evocative, and heavy, heavy, heavy.  A marked change in style from their previous thrash-death albums \\"Schizophrenia,\\" \\"Beneath the Remains,\\" and \\"Arise,\\" \\"Chaos A.D.\\" sees the band starting to use a more rhythmic, groove-oriented approach that foreshadows their later work. \\"Refuse Resist\\" starts the album off on a rollicking note, with Max's vicious bark and some politically charged lyrics over a driving guitar beat, topped off by the chorus's anthemic shout of \\"Refuse, Resist!\\"  Subsequent songs like \\"Territory\\" and \\"Amen\\" slow things down a little bit, but follow the same pattern of growled polemics with propulsive tribal grooves and some fancy guitar leads by Andreas.  The band also mixes things up a bit with the blistering thrash of \\"Biotech is Godzilla,\\" the lush tribal instrumental \\"Kaiowas,\\" and the slow, almost atmospheric \\"We Who Are Not as Others.\\"  If you like metal, you can't go wrong with \\"Chaos A.D.\\"
6302878527|5.0|I can't believe this film is not more famous.  I had never even heard of it until I came on amazon to buy her other movies and saw it listed.  I came upon it the other day in the video store and had to rent it.  I was so impressed.  This is now one of, if not my favorite Audrey movie.  This is a movie like no other Audrey had ever made.  The only downs to the movie are the poor editing job in one scene where Audrey is running from the side and is suddenly cut into the middle of the frame.  The other is Audrey's other romantic interest half way through the film, the directors should have found someone better.  These minor mistakes, however, do not take away from the overall movie.  One of my favorite parts of the movie was when she said \\"bastard\\" to Finney in the most loving way.  I have noticed in many of her contemporary romantic films she says one word in just the perfect way, she says it softly as she exhales and it just comes out wonderfully.  Look for the words, you'll find them.  This is a movie any Audrey fan must see!
B00005N9CV|5.0|This is a great collection of ballads in the tradition of singers who flitted between styles from album to album (i.e. Sinatra, Ella, Tony etc.).  I'm very sorry for people who can't appreciate it.  Diana-do what you want!  I'll keep buying.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|I just got back from a trip through Central and South America and this was one of the albums I heard through my trip.<BR>I like this one better than Clandestino... it is a bit more mature.<BR>And you can see that the time that he speant between albums was well used.
0553573403|5.0|This is not your typical fantasy.  It seems that alot of fantasy is just a wild idea or setting, but this book has good characters, plot and dialogue.  I really liked the belgarade and mallorean series, but the characters all seemed too much the same.  Not so here.  The characters are unique and interesting.
B00005JKED|5.0|If you are second guessing purchasing this film, dont just buy it is worth the money.
0060916540|4.0|A great story, perhaps not a great literary work, but captivating enough. My impression was that this book was written by Joe Simpson as part of a cathartic process of sorts, to deal with the trauma of the experience. Scathing reviews such as that of lazza are completely misguided, as this book wasn't written for such an audience. If you are interested in the extremes of mountain climbing and want a little insight or perhaps inspiration, then this modern mountaineering classic is the book for you. Otherwise, you may still find it to be a gripping read, but don't expect delicately crafted prose.
0385335482|5.0|I find myself recalling favorite portions of this book every time I whip out my charge card to buy something, and it always brings a big smile.  The person at the register invariably looks at me funny, but who cares?  <BR>     I'm no shopaholic, just a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's hilarious, observant account of one acquisitive young woman's struggle with her shopping demons.<BR>     For laughs and light social commentary, Shopaholic is right up there with other recent comic gems, like Bridget Jones, and Filthy Rich, Dorothy Samuels' madcap take on America's celebrity obsession.
B000002J20|4.0|The above quote comes from the fourth movement RITUAL. Not only a clear-headed observation(and one of the album's main insights), but also a telling observation on the conception of this most unusual musical odyssey. Look, let's make things clear if we can. It is often said that Wakeman dislikes the album because he derided its length at the time it came out. True, but where he was really coming from was when he said, \\"We had enough material for one album...if CDs had been available then there was enough good material on that album to make a 50-minute CD. We had a bit too much to go on an album of 36 minutes but not enough for a double album\\". Wakeman went on to say that it could have been \\"a sensational album\\" and this \\"padding\\" as he calls it upset him. His admittance to deeply caring about Yes's music caused him to make outbursts upon Tales' release, even though Rick has since gone on to explain those remarks as merely his naturally flippant way of dealing with his frustrations. A self-admitted exaggerator of his feelings, he has expressed regret over his, to quote him again, \\"innapropriate\\" remarks because many people actually took his \\"wading through a cesspool to get to a waterlilly\\" comments and the like seriously. \\"What happened then was real stubbornness set in. And I take a lot of the blame. Instead of me saying, 'I think there are a lot of nice things on this album,' I just said, 'It's [junk].' And Jon in defence said, 'It's a work of art.'\\" Obviously, other members of Yes, especially Anderson, Howe, and White did not see the humor in what they saw as off-the-cuff remarks. Anderson himself does agree with Rick about this album's length. The common misconception is that Anderson would've wanted it even longer still. In fact, if it wasn't for the record company getting in the way as usual, Jon would've, in his own words, \\"...reissue it on CD as an hour of music, with remixes or overdubs...I've always thought that three quarters of (Tales) was an excellent album, with another quarter not quite jelling. In the classic times, an artist would have had time to revise it, but with issue dates the album was out before we had time to listen to it properly, because you'd have to go out world touring\\". Also, those who criticize Jon's lyrics for being \\"unintelligiable\\" / \\"gibberish\\" are actually over analysing his deliberate approach. He has addressed this by simply stating, \\"It's not always the case that lyrics have to be heard as lyrics rather than just vocal sound\\". This statement shows him not to be the pretentious, self-appointed mystic that others have reveled in painting him to be. Jon has went so far as to honestly point out in an admirably,humble way that(concerning his tackling the Shastric scriptures as the concept), \\"I've had to deal with it on a broad basis, however, because I don't honestly feel that I know everything there is to know about the subject\\". So, if that doesn't make things clearer still, well then its interesting to take into account what Howe has said as well. \\"We had so much space on that album to explore things which I think were tremendously good for us. Big arrangements, certainly, but we didn't see any problems with it!\\" As most of us know, Tales was simultaneously heralded as Yes's best album by far and by far their worst. Well, as is commonly known, the sensationalist, negative remarks tend to be remembered and repeated throughout the years when it comes to just about everything it seems. Its a telling statement about cynicism run rampant, but we're not here for a discussion on the human condition. However, it is a shame that much positivity is forgotten about. \\"Life IS Like A Fight.\\" Yep. Of interesting note, Tales and Relayer are Alan White's faves and Squire has remarked about his bass work on The Remembering, \\"One of the nicest things I think I've ever played is on side two of Topographic. I'm prouder of that than I am about some the things that people rave about. The bass line just happensto bind it all together...It's a very successful piece of arranging, and when I hear it, I definitely feel that I couldn't have played anything righter, and one doesn't often get that feeling\\". Despite the fact that Topographic doesn't rock out as muck as the previous albums with Howe, it is filled with superb vocal harmonies and inventive melodic and percussive arrangements. If it is for this main reason that Topographic comes under fire(less rock, more orchestral in feel)from certain quarters, then so be it. It is still unlike any other rock album, Yes or otherwise. And what's so bad about ambition that leads to a truly unique creation such as this? Art is a fight...
0962477060|5.0|CAGED.  That is it in a nutshell.   This system teaches you how to take the fundamental chord forms, CAGED, and from these forms develop an understanding of the fretboard in a logical fashion.  It builds on this with chords, scales, and leads.   I think it is a great system.  I have been playing guitar for years and it has helped me get around the fretboard better and identify things more quickly.  It takes some practice to learn the material and i am still working on it.
B000060P79|5.0|After seeing these guys live when they opened up for Sugar Ray, I became an instant fan. (I even got all their autographs and met the guys after the concert!) They are an awesome punk rock group with killer music. I went out and bought the album and all the songs on there rock...songs like I'm Just A Kid, My Alien, and Addicted are awesome. If you like bands like Blink-182 or Sum41....you'll love Simple Plan even more! I recommend everyone to go out and buy this album....Simple Plan rocks!!

Perhaps not quite as funny when i first saw it spontaneously on TV the first time, but still it is quite funny, especially if you are John Cleese fan and like his form of humor.

B00004Z4SD|4.0|Tarkovsky said once [A. Tarkovsky, Sculpting in Time, 1984] - \\"... there are only two kinds of directors. The first kind usually creates their own world, sometimes a bit more vivid than reality - Kurosawa, Bresson, Dovjenko, Fellini, Bergman for example. These are usually poets. The second level directors tend to only imitate what they see. They might be good at it, but the fact remains - its an imitation.\\"<br />David Lynch is not a second level director, that's for sure. His work has been described as bizzare, illogical and disturbing. You either hate his movies and turn off the movie after 2-3 mins of watching, or fall in love with every piece he's ever made. You can not stay indifferent. Just like poetry does not have to rhyme to be poetry, his work does not have to be liked by everybody. <BR>Back to Straight Story.<BR>Here is the scoop: it's a movie about an old man who drove his  lawn mower from Iowa to Wisconsin to see his brother who had a stroke.<BR>Not impressed? Wait till you hear this. The lawn mower is a 1966 John Deere and the movie was shot by Disney.<BR>Lets not get carried away here - there is a plus side to it too. The music (as always with Lynch) wrote by Angelo Badalamenti. From the first 2 minutes of the movie you will notice that it is in fact a Lynch movie. However, there is nothing bizzare or disturbing anymore. A lot more calm  to. Badalamenti shines in this one. Unbelievable sensuality. You have to be blind and deaf not to get too emotional at the end. I did.<BR>The movie is the best example of what kind of people Americans are - openminded, gracious, companionate.<BR>Highly recommend to Lynch's fans. Don't miss it. Will regret if you do.
0451527712|4.0|I read this for 11th grade english and was not thrilled with having to read it because I wanted more Shakespeare.  However I did read this book and was struck at how many themes in it were applicable to the moral battles being fought today.  Stem-cell research, cloning, designer babies, etc... All of this was being touched on by an author who couldn't ever dream how true her prose might ring.  My experience with this book may be distorted because when you read a book with a guide (such as a teacher) your opinions become mingled with your teachers.  The character of Victor is fascinating but he is one that you will hurt deeply for.  He does so many things that will repulse you and he takes so little responsibilities for his creation and the consquences that will spring from it.  Read it and soak up the story.
B000007S5B|3.0|The first two Doors albums are among my all time favorite records. Unfortunately, after all the early material was used up their remaining albums were never able to achieve the same degree of consistency. Yes, they were still more than capable of recording some great songs, but the magic had died.  Waiting for the Sun's major defect is Morrisons vocals. He sounds bored to death on all the slow to mid tempo songs.  Listen to Morrison's incredible  singing on the Crystal Ship and I can't see you Face in my Mind, and compare them to the flat delivery of Yes, the River Knows and Summers almost gone. Maybe it had something to do with Rothchilds need to record take after take, I don't know. Of their other efforts, The Soft Parade, and Absolutely Live are the worst.  Morrison Hotel is the best. LA Woman is on par with Waiting for the Sun, except by now Morrison really did sound like an (extremely) old blues man.  I did not mind the Doors attempting to expand and change their sound. I just did not like it when it was a poorly executed change.  P.S. Buy \\"Riders on the Storm\\" by John Densmore. It is a very good book.
6304935803|5.0|I knew that George C. Scott was a good actor, but you will never realize exactly how great he is until you see this film.  After seeing pictures of General Patton, it is hard to image the general without thinking of the actor.<br />There is some German and French in the movie, but there are subtitles or someone translating for you.  There is not enough to detract from the movie, but there is enough to keep the movie authentic.<br />This was not a war movie meant to build up the general as larger than life.  Here, you see not only the fire of Patton, but the pathos of a man trying to succeed in a world that he wasn't born for.  In the movie, they point out that he seemed to be ready for the sixteenth century.  He also mentions that he was at many of the historical battles.  With his extensive reading, I do not doubt it.  Although he tries to play politics, he really isn't ready for it.  His forte is battle and seeing him held from it hurts the viewer as well as Patton.<br />I did like the ending of him walking his dog, but I was expecting the rest of the movie.  I do not know why it was omitted.<br />I would strongly recommend this movie.
0441003257|5.0|this book is pretty awesome.  i normally don't enjoy reading but i couldn't put this book down.  and i'm normally afraid of dying and stuff but this book has such a humorous way of looking about heaven and hell that.. its all good now! heh.. sorta.  how can you not love this book.  the characters are developed so well and you just learn to luv em by the end of the story...
079213690X|5.0|The Braveheart must be simply THE best movie I ever saw. It is very touching and heroic and there are no silent scenes. All are packed with action and betrayal, hop, love and fight for freedom.<BR>It shows what life was really like for Scots in the 13th century. It was very cruel and hard for Scots to live in! It portrays the Englishmen as the most ruthless people on Earth. Of course, that is not so now in 21st century, but in that time period it really was like that!<BR>The music of the movie is very beautiful as well - mix of Scottish pipes and chilling tones. The special effects and the gory sights of blood are completely effective!!!<BR>When I watched that movie for the first time, I felt like I was really among the Scots, in the middle of the battlefield, staring at the brutal fight.<BR>For anyone who has not seen Braveheart, there is only one thing to say: GO GET IN ON THE VHS!!
B00003CXI1|2.0|I agree with some of the peeps who gave a review of harry potter already. The movie is nothing as good as the books. I liked the Harry Potter books, myself. When it was time the movie came out, I didn't want to see it. Once my family made me see it, I complained a lot, like most 14 year old kids do...I was right about everything I had said about this movie. It was mainly a violent movie for kids. The movie made me think about something: Why the heck do they care about what their school does? I would mind my own buisness if there were dogs as tall as the empire state building gaurding a stupid stone! I think most people would! <br />Worse than that, the acting was horrible. The kids were obviously not that experienced, they forshadowed way too much, and some very cheesy and terrible attempts of humor.<br />Believe me. This is a kid's movie. Don't get this. This series will be successful, but only because dumb younger kids will drag their parents to the theatres to see the 4 eyes british boy save the world (including the \\"muggles\\"). Don't get it!
B00004XPP0|3.0|Greedo shooting first? What the [heck] is that all about? It had to be one of two things. Lucas thought that Solo's character wasn't noble enough and shooting Greedo unexpectedly just wasn't nice so he had him defending himself. If this is the case then it is a total rewrite and rape. The guy is a smuggler come on! The only other reason would be that the original script called for it and with this new edition he wanted give everyone a look at the way it was supposed to be. If you want to digitally remaster it great, but don't rewrite history you turkey. I don't care if he directed it...I had to give this version three stars. The orginal deserves ten of course.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I'm gonna have to say that the reviewer at the top of the page missed the point of this album. Andrew likes to party. He wants to insinuate his point, overbearingly so. After so much teenie boper music and rage/rap/rack combos, Andrew delivers exactly what we needed in a single, quintessential album. English is spelled with on e.
0790729725|1.0|No one will question the brilliance of this film. BUT WHY DO WE HAVE TO FLIP OVER A DVD? Isn't that why we moved from laserdiscs to DVDs?
0375728007|5.0|I chose to read this book because the movie was out and it caught my attention. The comerical was interesting and I became wildly curious. The last time that I saw a commercial and made me want to read the book very much was never. I couldn't wait until the next delivery at Borders arrived so I could get the book. To me, it was a must have kind of book, and I wouldn't let anyone stop me from gettin the book. I was determined to buy the book and read it for myself.<BR>The main charcter of this book is Landon Carter, in fact, the book is in his point of view. Landon is a troublemaker whom parents don't want their children to hang around. One day, a play forces him get closer to Jamie Sullivan, the social outcast of the school. Soon, Landon falls in love with Jamie, the problem is that Jamie is a God freak and thats what makes her an outcast, and he doesn't want to ruin his reputation. One day, Jamie finally confronted him. Jamie was diagnosed with lukemia in the summer and only had couple months to live. Landon askes Jamie to marry him and couple weeks later, they were married. To him, Jamie was a miracle that God had brought to him.<BR>I like this book because when I finished reading it, I thought that the book was so sweet. Everything that Landon and Jamie had gone through seemed like an everlasting list of mean cruel things that Landon had done to Jamie. In the end, Landon found the answer that he was searching for. Jamie didn't live the best life in the world, but she was always happy with what she had. To me, the book had a moral and was so sad, but they overcame their obstacles in.

Poem to a Horse- This is very very VERY strange but automatically gets U hooked!<br />I really think u should buy this because the good songs R well worth the money!
B00005N91B|2.0|... but I gave this movie a fair try.  It came w/ my DVD player as some sort of promotional thing.  I had seen the movie years ago and didn't remember it that well.. I was rather indifferent about it at the time.  <br />But a few years pass and I think that I have a definite opinion... nay, an equation (for all of you math folks):<BR>  <BR>Basic Instinct = Fatal Attraction = Disclosure.<br />As undersexed people around the world cheer the \\"sheer brilliance\\" of this film, I must say it's predictable, typical Hollywood garbage.  What's the difference between \\"soft porn\\" and \\"erotic thriller\\"?  2 names: Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas.  Basically, a detective falls in love w/ someone he is supposed to be digging up dirt on.  Blah blah blah blah blah.  I didn't see it as a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock or anything...<br />But one redeeming factor in this movie is Sharon Stone's sense of style.  When she has clothes on, she wears them nicely.  And she does have a nice body.  But clothes and body don't make a film great.  It sure did not help this one.  <br />Hey, but at least I got a cool pen that looks like an icepick.  Excuse me while I go stab a rock star....
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is a spectacular film that redefines the &quot;hollywood&quot; musical. Most of the songs are updated versions from some of the best artists of our time like Sting, Elton John, and Madonna.<BR> When I first saw Moulin Rouge it wasn't what I expected at all. The first few scenes are hyper and strange, but in a good way, its fun to watch. But then, when Ewan McGregor goes to the Moulin Rouge to meet Nicole Kidman and breaks into that first note of &quot;Your Song&quot;, I found myself under the movie's spell. That scene still gives me chills. haha<BR>Anyways, it will probably be a movie that you will either love or hate. Its so different from any film out there, but I think thats what makes it so magical. Its daring, different, and totally redefines &quot;musical&quot;. Its definitely worth seeing once so you can decide for yourself. You be the judge.<BR>The DVD is absolutely jammed-pack with a ton of extra features on it, which I haven't even gone through all of them yet. I have not seen a DVD so thorough to this date. <BR>This movie and DVD will definitely become a classic!
B00005BCOL|5.0|I had to add this video to my library. I saw it for the first time several years ago and I have been searching for my own copy ever since. This is a movie about men and how women deal with them.  However, there are no men in the movie and not once will you hear a man's voice. It is so well-written with stellar performances by some of Hollywood's vintage actresses.  It's touching with an honest sense of humor.  A must-see!
B00005OAIE|5.0|As a sophomore in college, I can say with full conviction that I have never come across an album that I can relate to as well as Room For Squares.  Every song has relevance to my life, and most other people in my age group especially.  In &quot;Why Georgia&quot; John cries out that question we all ask, &quot;Am I living it right?&quot; while we all say stupid things from time to time that we can't take back, John makes a stand by saying &quot;I'm never speaking up again, it only hurts me.&quot;  And he's also got a great song to get some lovin to with &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland.&quot;  The cd has everything to offer.  For those of you who love to sing in your car, this album has 13 catchy tracks that will not get old!  John Mayer rocks!
B00005RFAI|5.0|This CD is full of inspirational words showing that you can do anything you want to--the only person stopping you is your self. It encourages girls to respect themselves and to go for it. My favorite songs on the album that make me want to dance are tracks 1,2,and 3. It's more of a &quot;girl&quot; CD then it is a guys, but guys could learn alot from it.
B000000OA6|5.0|When you see the high praise given to this album, the last one released before Freddy Mercury died, you might think people gave it 5 stars just out of sympathy or what have you, but no...the material here is actually deserving of such a rating. Freddy was suffering heavily throughout the making of this one, which makes his vocal work on &quot;Headlong&quot; and &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; that much more admirable. There is also the sweet sweet harmony of &quot;These Are the DAys&quot; and the silly &quot;I'm Going Slightly Mad.&quot; To hear him wrench these vocal takes out of his pain-wracked body is just a mind-blowing thing.
B00005MM01|5.0|If you're looking for the definitive Donovan, then you've found him in this set of recordings.  It is quite simply a masterpiece of creative music.  Partly aimed at children, it is wholly aimed at adults who are not looking for sophisticated ideas and double meanings which have to be 'read into'.  <BR>You can sit back, relax and sing along with these songs, songs which have stood the test of time and which are still as fresh today as they were in the 1960s when they were first written.  Donovan clearly excelled himself and showed himself for the musical genius he truly is in these pieces.<BR>You can invest in this set of recordings with complete safety in the knowledge that you are not going to be disappointed.  Quite simply, and in the opinion of an awful lot of true Donovan fans, the best work he has ever done.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|I was [ticked] that we rented this trash.  My wife and I did not laugh once during the part of the movie we managed to watch before turning it off.  I cannot honestly believe that those who were involved with the making of this movie laughed even once when they watched the finished product....
B00004SYWZ|4.0|It's November 1985. An unknown Norwegian band morphs from virtual unknowns into MTV darlings with their unique music video, \\"Take On Me\\". In no time, their song is No. 1 on the U.S. Charts, No.2 in the U.K. <br />Fast forward to 1993: the \\"Memorial Beach\\" album fares poorly; they're barely afloat in the music scene. The band makes a quiet exit to pursue individual interests, destined to be just another relic of the 80s.<br />Or so we thought. Seven years later, A-Ha rose from the ashes of obscurity with \\"Minor Earth, Major Sky\\". Their earlier music had dwindled to mediocrity, but the new A-Ha is deliciously dark in its lovelorn sentiments, with ions-better lyrics since their \\"scoundrel days\\". (Old fans, be pleased to note that Morten Harket's voice is as good as it was seventeen years ago!) <br />The title track is darkly introspective; the despair in the lyrics well deflected by strong background music. Other standouts are the wistful \\"Little Black Heart\\" and \\"Velvet\\", which was featured in the soundtrack of the movie \\"One Night At McCool's\\". <br />\\"The Sun Never Shone That Day\\" is a catchy follow-up to the tender \\"Summer Moved On\\". But it is enchanting and poignant \\"I Wish I Cared\\" which is by far the best track here, and the sweetest complement to Harket's emotive voice. <br />Still, the album would've been better if not for the whiny \\"The Company Man\\". \\"Barely Hanging On\\" is rather mediocre too, and unfortunately the only song Harket strains to perform. I rate the remaining songs on the \\"nice\\" scale. <br />Overall, A-Ha's latest effort is full of talent and potential. Check this one out, even if you're new to the band. It's uplifting to know that U2's not the only 80s band out there who's aged gracefully.
B000003B6J|5.0|this album plays like a greatest hits album. the greatest testtament to what it's like being a young black male on the streets in america. ice cube,easy-e, ren, and dre, dropped some of the hardest lyrics ever in music, and dre made his reputation as a a-list producer by producing this record. i know every song on here word for word. it sounds fresh even after  100 plays. get it...
B00005Q4CS|5.0|DO NOT adjust your set when you pop this eye-opener about addiction in your DVD player, it's all intentional and quite one of the most startling presentations rivalled perhaps by the current 'Moulin Rouge'.<br />WARNING!   No favourite beverage when you travel through these sad minds - you might just not return intact .......<br />The brilliant ELLEN BURSTYN spearheads this odyssey as the mother, son is Jared Leto, with Marlon Wayans as the pal, and JENNIFER CONNELLY as 'son's girlfriend'.    It's a close companion to &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; - uncovering those little secrets we hide with that sniffle or two from our loved ones - with the usual shattering result.   The mother is addicted to 'self-help' TV, suddenly weight obsessed due to one of those random invitations to appear on TV.   The son?   The hard stuff with girlfriend and pal in tow.<br />Brilliant editing, you enter the stop-go mind of the addicted - straight through the looking glass   -  without a crash helmet.<br />BUT be warned - cautionary viewing, should be mandatory for the young, [but quite impossible].<br />Director Darren Aronofsky sees all of this with a sympathetic but savage eye - details are not spared - makes 'The Days of Wine and Roses' look like 'The Sound of Music'.<br />A 'must-see' and 'must-have' for the serious film scholar.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is definately one of Russels best acting. It is more than sure that Russel did something that is unique so I think that he is going to get his second academy award, he deserves it.P>Dr.Nash did(is) not see(ing) things. He heard(s) things. Its a state of the ultimate imagination that he possesses. Sometimes the  imagination is so big that crosses the line and gets dillusional.   <br />His thesis title is \\"Non-Competitive games\\" and I think that the movie is propably correct showin that his work was inspired by Adam Smith in his work on the \\"Wealth of Nations\\" which stated that a nation works best when every individual works for his own benefit.  I think that the scene in the bar where Russel points out Nash inspiration by explaining why they(he and his friends) should not work competitive to gain a girl is amazing.<br />Also some other thins are not so acurate but they are kind of more personal and I don't want to mention them. You can find his biography in the net as I did.<BR>Returning to the movie I must mention that the atmosphere of the movie was very realistic. <br />Also the scene where Nash received his Nobel prize reminded casting equivalent to giants of cinema, so this is the magnitude of acting we are talking here...Russel was Nash!
0783225733|5.0|Those words are the tag line for every fictionalized account of space exploration disaster, but the one time they were spoken in earnest makes all the fictionalized accounts wane like the setting moon.<br />APOLLO 13 is a great film. Tom Hanks, who plays Jim Lovell, spacecraft Commander of the aptly-named \\"Odyssey\\" really deserved an Academy Award for this one (and might have gotten it, had he not already won previously, two years running).<br />The film recounts the terrifying ordeal of astronauts Lovell, Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), their families, and their ground-based support crew, after an oxygen tank explosion on the third lunar landing mission forces an abort. The three men have to reduce their spacecraft to barely livable conditions in order to survive a quarter-million miles from home.<br />Director Ron Howard captures the tension of the event perfectly, and also recaptures the ambience of NASA in 1970, a mixture of energy, technical competence, and frustration, when it seemed the American public had just about forgotten it's once lionized space program in the wake of moon missions so successful they seemed absolutely boring.<br />For anyone old enough to remember those fearsome days of Apollo 13, as I do, this movie sparks memories. For a moment in time, the planet was united: besides the Western Powers, the Soviets, the Red Chinese, the North Koreans and North Vietnamese set out rescue vessels to retreive the returning men.<br />With barely enough electricity to run a toaster, limited water, no heat, and hardly any oxygen, the three astronauts faced almost certain death. Ron Howard captures their understated emotion, as well as their phenomenal resilience and test-pilot cool, without making them seem miraculously superhuman or unassailably cold-blooded.<br />Bacon's Swigert, a last-minute replacement to the crew can't help but gloat over his good luck, and then becomes increasingly waspish as the disastrous mission winds on.<br />Gary Sinise, as Ken Mattingly, grounded for an illness he'd never contracted, is at first embittered, but later becomes an enthusiastic fourth crew member as he unstoppably tests out rescue scenario after rescue scenario in the NASA simulators.<br />Bill Paxton plays an increasingly ill Fred Haise with such conviction that the viewer shudders with compassionate sympathy as Fred's flu and fever make him both less able to contribute and less willing to give in to his sudden illness.<br />Kathleen Quinlan, as Marilyn Lovell, and Ed Harris, as Gene Krantz, both turn in true-to-life performances, both of which capture the hopes and fears not only of Mrs. Lovell and Flight Controller Krantz, but of the rest of the hundreds of people involved in the rescue effort on the ground.<br />Without becoming \\"documentary\\" the film uses clips of actual news broadcasts to underscore its reality. What's particularly surprising is the low-tech state of the Apollo; a digital wristwatch of today has more computing power than the entire Apollo space vehicle. This movie is also a very watchable, almost completely accurate history. There are a few moments of Directorial license in the telling of the tale, but not many. The story doesn't need additional drama. I recommend Jim Lovell's excellent book LOST MOON (or APOLLO 13), to sort out the occasional changes.<br />As it was, the technology of Apollo both failed and succeeded beyond reckoning. As spectacular an accomplishment as a moon landing is, it pales besides the importance of the human drama.<br />\\"I don't care what anything was designed to do,\\" barks Krantz at one point, \\"I only want to know what it can do.\\" It  seems that Jim Lovell's mother has the answer: \\"If they could get a washing machine to fly, my Jimmy could land it.\\"<br />APOLLO 13 is a great testament to the human spirit.br />Gary Sinise, as Ken Mattingly, grounded for an illness he'd never contracted, is at first embittered, but later becomes an enthusiastic fourth crew member as he unstoppably tests out rescue scenario after rescue scenario in the NASA simulators. <br />Bill Paxton plays an increasingly ill Fred Haise with such conviction that the viewer shudders with compassionate sympathy as Fred's flu and fever make him both less able to contribute and less willing to give in to his sudden illness. <br />Kathleen Quinlan, as Marilyn Lovell, and Ed Harris, as Gene Krantz, both turn in true-to-life performances, both of which capture the hopes and fears not only of Mrs. Lovell and Flight Controller Krantz, but of the rest of the hundreds of people involved in the rescue effort on the ground. <br />Without becoming \\"documentary\\" the film uses clips of actual news broadcasts to underscore its reality.

B00005JKBC|4.0|Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) has an exciting last day of retirement as his protege Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) is arrested and put in prison in China.  Back at Langley, the top members of the CIA are trying to figure out what went wrong with Bishop's mission.  The movie is exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It tracks the history of American covert operations through the last couple decades; moving from Vietnam, to Berlin, to Beirut, to China.  You're caught up in the adventure as Muir trains Bishop to be the perfect case officer.  I give this movie four stars because it's exciting and it realistically portrays the world of a spy.  There are no laser watches, evil doctors, sports cars with rockets, or explosive pens.  In short it's not a James Bond spy film, but its great none the less.

B00000IFP6|5.0|The new editions of the Beethoven symphonies are novel in the sense that they've been cleaned up; there are audible differences in all the symphonies.<br />Tempi are quick, but the orchestra is so precise that the tempi come almost naturally.  In the recording of the first symphony, the last movement never feels rushed, but instead is so fresh that it makes slower recordings like Karajan et al, seem stodgy.  <br />It's interesting to note the inclusion of an alternative version of the last movement of the 9th, with a general pause due to the edition and supposedly in the original.  <br />Fans of the 7th might be a little disturbed by the quick 2nd movement, it probably isn't allowed to 'sit' enough, though the solo lines are still extremely well shaped.<br />Great value at $62AUD!

0060254920|5.0|This book is about a boy named Max who puts on a wolf costume and feels like making some trouble. He breaks some rules and is sent to bed without supper. That night his imagination runs wild.  He goes on a journey in the jungle that has grown in his room. He meets many types of monsters on his journey and is returned safely home.<BR> I have always loved reading this book. The story is fun and adventurous.  The illustrations are extremely well done and do wonders for the story. I loved it as a child and I still love it now. The book gives children a chance to use their imagination. This is a book that I will use both as a teacher and with my own children someday. Whether you like the story itself or you just like to look at the illustrations, this is definitely a book for people of all ages. I think that the author was trying to relay the message of \\"do the crime pay the time\\".  Showing that although getting into trouble can be fun sometimes, there is always a price to pay.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Among the special features on the original DVD version is an interview with Joni Mitchell which was originally printed in Rolling Stone magazine.  The great questions in the movie pushed the envelope, in an effort to understand what was cool, as that kind of question might be asked by a teenager whose mother was the Goethe-quoting college professor whose attitude about everything was the opposite of cool.  In the process of being confronted by such an individual, Joni happened to remember a night when she wanted to crash a party, and someone at the door, who had been dubious about letting any stranger in, suddenly realized that Joni Mitchell being there was more cool than anything that had ever happened in the young lives of the people who had been invited.  As I remember the interview, Joni was 36 and wondering if she might find a man who would be around long enough (six year minimum in modern times) for her to be an appropriate mother, and she wasn't likely to find him at that party, which was sometime when she was much younger, anyway.  Watch the movie first, which is about being young, before you try to understand the interview, which is two aging people trying to get a grip on art, or escaping the grip of what is currently considered cool by fleeing the social scene, jumping into a swimming pool, or mostly, by growing old.
B000009ED0|5.0|I heard a Kid Rock song off the computer from a file sharing thing, and decided to buy the CD that same day so that I could listen to it in my car.  If it wasn't for the file sharing, I probably wouldn't have bought the CD.  I really like listening to &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot; as I drive past the blue Caribbean sea.......
B00000DFTH|5.0|You can find here everything you need if you are a fan. If you are not buy those 2 live CDs of Black Sabbath's best songs anyway. There is no way not to enjoy it.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|This is a great album. Personally, it doesn't touch me quite as much as Tidal does, but it is, nonetheless, wonderful. Her lyrics are beautiful and INCREDIBLE (perhaps even better than those on tidal) and she's definitely done some growing since 1996. &quot;love ridden&quot;, &quot;get gone&quot;, &quot;paper bag&quot; and &quot;i know&quot; are my personal faves. if you loved tidal, it may take a while to get used to When the pawn's new style, but soon you will LOVE it. 2 thumbs up, great family fun. ps, if you don't already own tidal, BUY IT. i'm not kidding. (and listen to &quot;never is a promise&quot;, track 7)
B00005LB9O|5.0|Since I found out about Godspeed you black emperor! and Sigur Ros last year, this definitely is one of the best musical acts I've come accross. These guys from Scotland have now three full-length albums out there, with this one being the most recent one. Francis Healy, the vocalist will knock you off your feet: resemblances to the voice of Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Jeff Buckleys's come to mind, but the way he blends into the band's musical work is simply perfect, and their music is so beautiful by itself (the guitar work is lovely at all times). While not being commercial at all, they have something to them that doesn't make them just another post-Radiohead band: musical influences from The Beatles stand out at every point of the album, by far exceeding any basic comparisons you could draw with Oasis (a band for which I admit not even remotely having any similar respect).<br />The entire album truly rocks, but the banjo-based \\"Sing\\" which magically opens the album; \\"Pipe Dreams\\" with it's beautiful lyrics; and the most amazing three songs you will have heard in some time, \\"Flowers in the Window,\\" \\"The Cage\\" and \\"Safe\\" top my list of favorites. I highly recommend it to the casual, Coldplay-type of fan of prog rock, as well as to the more die-hard, Radiohead-type of fan. You'll both be equally be glad to have stumbled accross Travis... just like I did, that is, if you already haven't made that discovery! ;)
B00004ZAV3|5.0|It's Been a Hard Day's night...And I Love her! Yeah, Beatles are the best of all times. Its endless listening to the Fabulous collection of Beatles and yet, you never ever ever tire of listening to the oldies. Especially Paul and Ringo are my favs and the cool number Yellow submarine make me remember my school days when we sang together in chorus. Love me do, You know I love you is a number I love to hum. I wanna hold your hand, Hey Jude, Yesterday, Let it be and It's been a Hard day's night are great numbers too. Its been so sad when John Lennon died! The beatles memory remains alive in our hearts and its great, whenever you see Paul MacCartney, its the wonderful Beatles popping up there. No wonder, George Michael's Inspirational role model could none be other than Paul MacCartney as far as I know!!
B00005Y1UX|1.0|The idea of a man giving into a million dollar offer to allow his wife a one nighter, with the proposing businessman, is absolutely indecent! This is the core of the story. Because of the married couple's financial woes, the husband feels that the money will save them and is more important than what's really at stake....the union and honor between the two! The film ends with the couple emotionally drained and, subsequently, divorcing (this is no surprise)! This film is a waste of time and is degrading....avoid this movie, indefinitely! It sends out a very immoral message to viewers.
B00005NW02|4.0|System of a Down's second album Toxicity adds an entire new dimension to thrash metal popularized by bands like Slipknot, although here the Armenian-Americans blend intricate and sometimes even delicate melody with manic, unsettling heavy metal. Serj Tankian's voice serves more of a tool to help the music rather than just an accompliment; Tankian can change from screaming, raging vocals to whispery sing-song parts in the same way that the music changes in emotion. Toxicity could well be the Nevermind of doom thrash in the way it so masterfully adds harmonic touches to the crazed rage that their 1998 self-titled debut first demonstrated. Toxicity is truly an album to lose oneself in and be carried away with the feel of the music. Every now and then it does seem to be going on for a bit too long in places but then saves itself with another flash of brilliance, like when the hysterical chorus of X kicks in or when the psychedelic breakdown of Science suddenly kicks in. I'm pretty sure this was the best album of 2001, beating other works of innovation like the Strokes' debut Is This It and even REM's return Reveal. Almost everyone should have a copy of this, although it is isn't for the faint-hearted. If you can stand it though, be sure to turn up Toxicity very loud on the stereo.
0375704027|5.0|You know a book is good when it sells so many copies it shocks the author into moving halfway across the world.<br />It's not the selling a whackload of copies, it's the fact that Murakami was appalled that the book he called an \\"experiment\\" became his most popular work.  <br />If you've never read any of Murakami's novels before, then you won't understand how entirely -different- Norwegian Wood is from them.  Murakami is a guy who writes about strange women with magic ears, men possessed by malevolent sheep, evil politicians with magical powers of defilement, teenagers who push their boyfriends off motorcycles, and cybernetic mind control.  The last thing one would expect from him is a pure and simple love story, but here it is, and fortunately or unfortunately, it is one of his most intriguing and skillful works.<BR>  <BR>The story's pretty easy to understand, but the layers of meaning are not.  Murakami's fascination with wells might zoom right over the heads of readers who are either unaccustomed to his narrative, or aren't paying attention to metaphor.  <br />Essentially, Norwegian Wood (yes, named after the song by the Beatles) is a love story, but one with unexpected twists of fate, tragedy, comedy, and stuffed with melancholia.  Murakami might not write a very convincing 20-year old, but the slight over-maturity of the main character's voice can be ignored in favor of the insights he gives.<BR>  <BR>I wouldn't reccomend reading this book first if you're seriously interested in Murakami's works, it's not the best to represent his style.  But if you aren't up for TV people or walking through walls, then read Norwegian Wood.
B000002KLP|5.0|I really wanted this album. I dont really shop much<BR>on the internet so I decided to buy it in a record store.<BR>Well this album is really rare and i couldnt find it anywhere.<BR>But when I was in one of the record stores and there was a sale<BR>I saw this album and just grabed it. I got home listened to it<BR>and boy I was sadisfied. This album containes 8 great tunes from<BR>the genius Prince. The entire album is great. Although<BR>its very short (30.12 minutes). But that doesnt matter because you will get one of the best , funkyest and greatest album ever. the lyrics are nice to (most about sex) but not many people were singing about it in 1980.
B00005JKZQ|1.0|Man was this a horrible movie...Can I give this 0 starts?  <br />The Plot, (and I use this work very loosely) In the world of reality someone with to much time on their hands decided to make a reality TV show about cops and how they do their job.  UG!! Its' the same ole, same ole, pairing two cops that dont' get along at first but become buds at the end. It's been done countless of times, and most of the time, it works. However, this is the exception to the rule....this is a horrible movie. You can lose count on how many movies were used to make this turkey.<br />De Niro, I can't see why he wanted to make this movie. My guess is that he lost a bet and he had to make it. Murphy wasn't funny either. Let's face it, his movies (except Shrek) have tanked.<br />If you want to see this movie, my suggestion is not to. Its' that bad. I had a free pass and used it...I still feel cheated. Please pull this turkey from the theaters....<br />The Tribe has spoken....it's time for it to leave.
0812550706|4.0|I bought Ender's Game because so many people recommended it to me. Later I wondered why I had listened. A book about a little boy who is a genius, taken away from his family at the age of six to save the world? Not my cup of tea, or so I thought. One of my reading groups, Armchair Readers 2, was doing a group read of Ender's Game and I thought I might as well read it with them.I was pulled in almost from the beginning.<br />When Earth was attacked by the \\"Buggers\\", they were taken by surprise. It was almost an accident that humans were able to destroy them. To prepare for another invasion, Earth began breeding military geniuses who would save the world. Children wore monitors from an early age so that their every thought, word, and deed was recorded. Ender Wiggin was the best of the best. Taken from his family at the age of six, he begins his education in war games strategy and command.<br />My heart ached for Ender's lost childhood and loneliness. As each test got harder and his isolation more complete, his determination for success grew. He knew he couldn't depend on anyone but himself because that was all he had. I quickly became attached to Ender and some of the secondary characters, as well. Geniuses all, they knew the world was depending on them and they pushed themselves to their limits. I highly recommend this book.
B000002KE2|5.0|Black Sababth's &quot;Vol. 4&quot; and &quot;Master Of Reality&quot; solidified these four blokes places in rock and metal history. Establishing themselves as forerunners in the heavy metal explosion, &quot;Vol. 4&quot; is as dark as it is a beast to behold.<br />Unleashing a doomy vengeance and dwelling within the deepest, darkest circles of the soul, Ozzy's crooning and Iommi's black magic guitar grabbed my attention from the get go and never did allow me to come up for air.<br />It's easy to say that this record is best heard during a thunderstorm. Musically it is nature's majestic wrath. Thick chords of doom, a harrowing wall of sound. Lyrics that could only be written by a future metal madman. &quot;Snowblind&quot; and &quot;Cornucopia&quot; being perfect examples of this. Sadness takes on a new definition in the classic &quot;Changes&quot;.<br />My absolute fave on the record has to be the last track &quot;Under The Sun/Every Day Comes And Goes&quot;. One of my favorite all time songs, and definitely one of the coolest riffs. Put this album right next to Priest's &quot;Sad Wings Of Destiny&quot; as being heresy if it is not in one's album collection. One of a few landmark Black Sabbath albums that are just a few reasons why bands past and present have slated the Birhmingham boys as major influences.
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors was the first album I bought as an adolescent 34 years ago. It would be redundant to try to add to all the critical hosannahs this album has received, so I won't try. Let it suffice to say that I picked up the CD this weekend and from the opening of Break On Through to the last notes of The End, the music still sounds as exciting and magnificent as it did all those years ago. Everyone should own this one.
B00000DCH9|4.0|When I acuired &quot;Piano Man&quot; I figured being one of Joel's earlier efforts, there wouldn't be much more here than the title track and &quot;Captain Jack.&quot;<br />The fact is &quot;Travelin' Prayer&quot; is a great opener to this album, and is different from anything else he's ever done.  The song tells a good story and I think serves as a good lead-in (however contrasting) into the title track.<br />&quot;The Ballad of Billy the kid&quot; is another strong track with tons of classical twists.  I first heard the song as part of the &quot;Millenium Concert&quot; album, and I still think it plays better live, but still worth cranking up on this album.<br />Finally &quot;Captain Jack&quot; closes the album quite opposite of the opening track.  The listner is drawn into a cynical view of society in which you just want to yell &quot;Geez Billy, how bad is society gonna get.&quot;  Listeners know this, and love this song for it.<br />&quot;Piano Man&quot; is an awesome album, and remeber this is just Joel's second album, but he's demonstrating the songwriting ability of a seasoned veteran.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I've seen this movie ages ago, and got the dvd on it's release.  I really wished this movie was on the oscars.  I really deserved to be out there and shown to more people.  It is the best movie of 2001, and on my favorite movies of all time list.  I suggest everyone who is reading this review to purchase this movie, and carefully watch it and follow everything that happens in the movie.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This movie grabs ahold of your heart near the beginning and holds on even after the movie is over.  Amazon was quick to deliver.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|You can't really call it a Movie, but a heck of a video for sure.  Nicole Kidman was certainly not the best actress this year (as we saw), and you really wanted to slap Ewan McGregor's character by the end.  Jim Broadbent was the true highlight.
0385484518|4.0|I loved this book. I gave it a 4-star rating only because I save the 5 for unbelievable, outstanding,to die for books. This was close. Read the book;you will love it.
6303159966|3.0|A grip taking, startling, suspenseful Stephen King thiller. You'll never look at your pet dog the same after you've witnessed the blood curdling Cujo. As most Stephen King movies do, it starts off a bit slow and may even be considered a bit tedious and boring. However, the end is worth the wait. <BR>       <BR>  A loveable St. Benard(Cujo) is infected with the rabies disease after being bitten by a bat. Dee Wallace Stone and Johnathan Pintauro star as mother and son held captive in their broken down automobile by the torturous beast. <BR>        <BR>  This movie does not need all the blood and gore of other King movies to make it affective. I say if you like Stephen King movies then, take a \\"BITE\\" out of Cujo and check it out!!!!
B00005T30L|5.0|Structured in a similar fashion to a lot of the teen comedies out there, but very different in content. This dark, sharp comedy was very enjoyable. Everyone gets made fun of in an intelligent manner.  All the characters were great, particularly Enid and Seymour. Contains lots of little jokes that may be missed on first viewing. After the disappointing graphic novel-to-film verions of &quot;From Hell&quot; (loved book, not movie) I was a little stand offish to view &quot;Ghost World.&quot; However, I now look foward to reading the book. Nice find.
0792839234|4.0|Phantasm was one of the first horror movies I happened to see. I was seven at the time and was really looking for a scare instead of a story. I have to say I didn't understand this movie when I first saw it. I recently watched this movie again and was pleasantly surprised by the originality of this film with the ability to still scare and delight. It still makes me jump. The effects aren't the greatest, but considering the film was made in 1979 they weren't all that bad for the times either.<br />The story about two brothers who notice strange going-ons at the local funeral home while paying their respects to a deceased friend. They decide to check it out but get much more then they bargain for. The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) is a tall terror and stalks the halls of the Morningside Mortuary with a flying spear that \\"wants to know what your thinking\\". <BR>If your looking for a different type of horror movie instead of the typical slasher Jason movies. Give Phantasm a try. Even the name is cool.

0525946284|3.0|With Jackdaws, Ken Follett returns to his most successful period, the darkest days of World War II... D-Day is approaching. It is 1944 and the Allies are preparing for the invasion of Europe. <br />In the occupied town of Sainte-Cecile, the French Resistance is preparing to blow up the chateau that now houses the vital telephone exchange connecting the French telephone system to that of Germany. Bombers have been unable to wreak enough damage on the chateau to disrupt communications for more than a few hours at a time, but the Allies need to make sure that communications is down for longer so that there will be as little forewarning of the invasion as possible. <br />Felicity Clariet, known as Flick, is a British secret agent responsible for sabotage; she has survived to become one of Britain's most effective operatives in Northern France. By day, Flick is a first-aider with the Nursing Yeomanry.  She knows that the Germans' ability to frustrate the Allied attack depends upon their lines of communications, and in the days before the invasion no target is of greater strategic importance than the largest telephone exchange in Europe. <br />But when Flick and her Resistance-leader husband try a direct, head-on attack that goes horribly wrong, her world turns upside down. ...<br />Follett shows his gift for putting the reader right in the center of the action with plenty of authentic details a narrowly thwarted disasters. ...<br />By and large the Follett delivers a very pleasurable, very cinematic thriller about a ragtag, all-female band of British agents. Adventure, romance, enough dashes of humour to stave off the antacids and a bit too much nasty violence crowd the pages of what promises to be one of Follett's better novels.<br />The author is a freelance writer based in Mumbai

B0000640VO|5.0|This movie touched me in a way that no other movie has.  I loved every minute of it. After living in Europe for 4 months, I was longing for something that would take me back. I took some of my friends to see it, but one by one at different times so that I could see it again.  Audrey Tautou is simply amazing. The music is perfect.  The characters embody a part of all of us.  This love story could happen to any one of us, and perhaps it will!  After 5 minutes I didn't even know the movie had subtitles, the language is so beautiful, I now want to go learn French.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I personally do not understand why people hate Britney Spears so much. She's decent enough for me, and a talented singer. And I'm an 18-year-old female, NOT a 13-year-old teenybopper. So I know music. I have to say 'Britney' is quite an excellent album, though not the best record of the year, but definitely not the worst, either. I loved this album so much that I went out and bought it--by the way, I also own Britney's two previous albums, as well ('Oops!...I Did It Again' and '...Baby One More Time'). I don't know which her best album is so far, but it's probably 'Oops!', and 'Britney' comes in second place. And you can't really blame Britney on her sex appeal because it's the media who's making her do it all.<BR>My favorite tracks on this album are \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\"--which is a very cool dance track, \\"Overprotected\\"--a song about Britney being too protected by everyone, \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\"--a song in which Britney sings about growing up, \\"Anticipating\\"--a fun dance song that's got a cool beat to it, \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll\\"--a classic remake of the Joan Jett song, and \\"Cinderella\\"--a very good upbeat song in which Britney sings about leaving her guy because he's too bossy and is always telling her what to do.<BR>Britney is definitely the next Madonna (whom I love as well). She's not going to go away anytime soon so get over it! Brit's career is just beginning. She may not have the best voice, but if you actually listen to her albums, you can tell that there are some points and some songs in which Britney actually has a pretty voice! And she can write songs, too. She wrote several songs on this CD.<BR>Her music is upbeat, funky, fun, and catchy and she IS a good role model. I think Britney deserves way more respect because she is always being bashed by the public and everybody even though she doesn't deserve it. She's a great role model 'cause she can continue to do what she loves doing even when everybody's dissing her and bashing her and she's got theguts to do a lot of things most girls wouldn't. She doesn't give up! I think we need more people like her...<BR>'Britney' is a great CD that was overlooked by a lot of people because it's bubblegum pop. Britney Spears rules! If you are the kind of person who can appreciate all music, then 'Britney' is a must-own album!<BR>A GREAT record.
B00005JKED|5.0|I am so glad Washington won the Best Actor Oscar ...for an unsaintly role. ...Washington inhabits this movie from the moment he appears onscreen and I'm glad to report that as a villain he is not over the top....Not here. Washington fully fleshes out this LAPD narcotics star policeman and how he's gotten to the top of his field by becoming one with the enemy.  In fact, you can even see the tidbits left over in his personality from the man he used to be.  Washington gives us little flashes of that man, showing us they are just about totally gone but not quite.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke always holds his own in a movie and this one is no exception.  His is a less showy role since he is the good guy cop but he nicely develops his character's moral dilemma throughout.  He is a squeaky clean young cop who is dedicated to eradicating crime the \\"right\\" way but his idealism looks fair to crushing him in modern day LA and with the LAPD. A very well written script, a stylish director who knew what he wanted to accomplish, actual LA gang members in the cast and some good performances from music industry members round out the film nicely.

B00005ASHM|5.0|This album is one of the classics of modern rock, one of the &quot;must-haves&quot; for your collection.  Highlights include the beautiful &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and the popular hit &quot;Sloop John B.&quot;
B000055ZB8|4.0|From the point of view of someone in 1922, this must have scared the daylights out of people.  We now are a lot less frightened; gore-driven horror films and hyper-realistic special effects have inured us to a lot of things that would have scared our great-grandparents into unconsciousness.<br />But even now, Max Schreck's performance is sublimely creepy.  His Orlok/Nosferatu is not the suave sexual vampire of post-Bela Lugosi times.  He's an incarnation of sickness and disease, whose totem animal is the plague-carrying rat rather than the bat.  He seems to carry the miasma of the grave, of rotting wood and mold and things that have decayed too far to even have the stench of death any more.<br />The other actors' performances are sometimes laughable and hammy, no doubt about that.  Greta Schroeder only seems to get into her character at the end, while Gustav Von Wangenheim, well, his performance is just plain odd and sometimes guffaw-worthy.<br />But Schreck, as Nosferatu, drains the inadvertent humor away, and makes you watch him every time he's onscreen.  He makes your skin crawl looking at him.  It's brilliant work for an actor in that period, handicapped as they were by the absence of sound and color.  Schreck seems to use these handicaps to his advantage, almost as if he knew they were there.  It's a very prescient role, in a sense; he set a tone, and put across a unique vision of the Vampire, that has never been matched or equaled.<br />The association of Nosferatu with the Black Plague is clearly drawn.  Nosferatu does not offer the vampire life as an eternal party where one never grows old.  He offers a vision of the vampire as someone who is ill unto death but cannot die.  He draws the life from others to keep himself at the edge of survival, while causing others to die from the disease he cannot let himself succumb to.  He points up something the other vampire movies do not address; the survival of the vampire is a trade-off.  He trades the Devil your life for his.  This makes the vampire worse than a simple predator. It makes him diseased in both mind and body, and willing to spread that disease.  Schreck's Nosferatu puts this point across with chilling power.<br />Yes, the restoration is as good as could be expected, especially considering this movie was thought to be utterly destroyed at several points in its history.  And I don't have a problem with the new music, although I can see why some people prefer to play gothic rock while watching it.  (Nick Cave, in particular, would go well with this movie.)<br />But the real reason you should see this is to watch Max Schreck, to watch Murnau's direction (which is an artistic statement in itself), and to sit and think about the question of what Nosferatu represents.  Nosferatu will not scare the pants off you.  But in the night, in the wolf hours, he will lurk at the back of your mind.  And what he represents is more frightening than anything his descendents have been able to show us.ur life for his.  This makes the vampire worse than a simple predator.

6302820448|5.0|You just have to love Bill Murray in this movie. This movie is one of my all time favorite comedies. I laugh just as hard every time I see it, and I have seen it so many times. Bill Murray is the reason why this movie is so funny. He is one of the funniest guys ever. He has this seriousness to him when he is making a joke that just makes it all the more funny. Of course if you are a Bill Murray fan, you have already seen this movie and I'm sure already have it in your movie collection. Even if you aren't, it's just too funny to not like. All I can say is, if you havn't seen this movie, you are missing out! You will laugh your head off!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|The buzz started a few weeks ago...and then there was much press about SXSW in Austin and Norah Jones always seemed to be high up in the articles. Now that I've heard the album, I can understand why!<br />Many have compared her style to Nina Simone, et al...I first went to the stylings of Holly Cole and her relaxed, soulful approach.  The entire album is a treat - from her original songs to the covers.  The players are wonderful too...Adam Levy sounds so much like Bill Frisell that I had to look at the notes (Frisell appears on another track).<br />The sparse production is just right....how could she go wrong with Arif Mardin? I look forward to following her what-is-going-to-be a long and illustrious career!
B00000JZIK|5.0|All I can really say is this movie has one of the best endings ever! I was totally blown away the first time I saw it! My jaw dropped! Great cast! Great storyline! Great acting! Suspensful and unforgetable! Make this movie a part of your collection!
B00005JKED|5.0|I dont know if i would give this movie 5 out of 5. I infact would give it 4.5 stars. However either way you better go to the nearest video store and rent this. It is extraordinaly good. Denzel Washington deserves the oscar and Ethan Hawke also did a wonderful job. This is a movie that relies on its acting due to the fact that most of it involves them talking to each other. However there is definatley plenty of action and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The script was also great. Fuqua went along way from Replacment Killers(but if you want a movie with non stop gunplay I urge you to check it out) and this movie was one of the best of the year. Check it out now.
B00005YTFG|1.0|In this age of noise above subtlety and  charm, this music video was a fitting touchstone. It is not a movie in the conventional sense but a jarring montage of fast moving glaring images and blaring sounds. It actually gave me a headache as I struggled through the first 10 minutes.If you are an afficionado of MTV and can endure seemingly random noise then this is the film for you, but alas not for me.
B000005Z0G|5.0|I'm only 17 and I have to embarassingly admit that I, like other teenagers my age, started listening to Pac AFTER his death. Regrettably this fact caused me to only listen to the most recent and well-known cuts by him. As I listened to more, I realized that this man was a lyrical genius and I quickly bought his earlier CD's including this one. Right from the get-go(Holla if ya hear me) I could feel my ears wanting to put every single track on repeat. I wanted to listen to the whole album but it was hard because every track was so addictive i almost couldn't get through the whole thing. Even Pac's theme(interlude) is powerful. Not being an actual song, it still shows just as well, Pac's genius and awareness towards our society. He is dead in physical form, but is very alive in his words and spirit. This Album proves it.
B00004XQ83|5.0|It's not often that a soundtrack lives up to the experience of the movie it comes from.  But this one is in a class by itself.  It never fails to re-evoke the sweet feelings I got from the movie, and yet it stands well enough on its own to bring joy to anyone who might (Heaven forbid) not have seen the movie.  The songs are THAT good.<br />The Cohen brothers' movie was much more than a movie; it was a song from the heart and soul of the great American spirit. Every time I play this album, I thrill at the songs like a surprise visit from a long lost best friend. This album, although filled with \\"old-timey\\" tunes, will never get old.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|Looks like a B-Version of \\"Das Boot\\" mixed with old-fashioned \\"we-are-the-heroes-the-others-are-criminals\\" patriotism mixed with \\"one-shot-from-us-kills-10, but we are invincible and keep on fighting even after being shot\\". The director seems to have seen to much B-Westerns from the 50s. Nevertheless worth to be looked at if propaganda and patriotism is your favourite subject or simply if you are interested in action movies without regards to the plot.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|\\"memento\\", although admittedly founded on an idea that makes so sense whatsoever, hits the mark as surrealism and an intriguing cinematic delve into extreme abnormality. the protagonist, leonard, forgets everything every ten minutes.(except that he forgets everything ten minutes. hmm.) able to function only through the use of notes and photographs, leonard is on a fierce quest to find his wife's killer, although it is never clear whether leonard wants to 'avenge' his wife's supposed murder or simply give himself some sense of purpose or meaning within his rather narrow mental horizon. the reviewers who call this movie fake and worthless are mistaken because the logic of it is not what makes it memorable, but rather the mood of disorientation and loss, uncertainty and ephemerality. in one monologue that is truly well delivered by guy pearce, leonard asks himself how he can possibly heal from the horrific tragedy he may have suffered if he cannot even remember the fundamentals of his life or who he really is. when talking to a thoroughly despicable character in a restaurant about his wife's personality, the clips of his memories of her are poignant and heartbreaking, exuding a sense of hopelessness and irretrievable loss that even the most vicious revenge could not pacify. the movie may be a metaphor for the human condition rather than a mere whimsical narrative by a brain damaged character given backwards:the meanings and goals we set in our lives are provisional, abstract, and we actually have no idea if they any 'reality' beyond the parameters of our own minds. as leonard says in a quote that resounds chillingly after the movie ends, we all need to believe the world exists when we close our eyes--perhaps it doesn't.
B000002R48|3.0|DT's first album was somewhat developmental in nature. While some of the stylistic elements can already be heard (particularly on the instrumental YTSEJAM, a perennial DT favorite), DT (particularly keyboardist Kevin Moore) were still trying to find their way. The hopelessly mismatched singer (James LaBrie first appears on the following album &quot;Images and Words&quot;) does not help one bit. This is definitely better described as hard rock with louder keyboards than as progressive rock or even prog-metal. <BR> <BR>&quot;The killing hand&quot; is quite a powerful track ---if somewhat too repetitive for my taste --- and there are nice bits scattered across other cuts (aside from the aforementioned YTSEJAM).<br />If you're a DT fan you'll want to have this for the sake of completeness. If Europe's &quot;The final countdown&quot; is your thing, you may actually like this album. Otherwise, *any* other DT studio album --- even the much-maligned &quot;Falling into infinity&quot; --- is a much better buy.
B0000026UL|4.0|I'm pretty new in the Dylan game, having first been exposed to him after seeing one of his great concerts in October 2000.  Since then, I've been slowly collecting Dylan albums, live albums, and bootlegs, but I'm not nearly the Dylan expert that some other reviewers are.<br />One of the things I like about later Dylan is that the musicianship and production has generally improved considerably.  In early masterpieces, the instrumentations, although occasionally showing flashes of genious (the Organ in Like a rolling Stone, for example), can be quite weak.  the drumming especially, tends to keep one rythm and stay with it for an entire tune, and for every song in which that works (Highway 61 Revisited), there are at least two songs where that fails (Tombstone Blues, Lily Rosmary and the Jack og Hearts).<br />In fact, when listening two new versions of the old classics, I'm amazed on how much better dylan got at playing them (his vocals aside).  The dynamics in live versions of 'Desolation Row' for example, makes it a much better song in 90s performances then it was in the 60s original.<br />With almost no exception, the very effective musicianship is evident throughout this album.  Producer Daniel Lanois probably deserve much of the credit; that has been said.  I believe, though, that Oh Mercy is even superior to Lanois and Dylan's famed collaboration of TIME OUT OF MIND.<br />TIME OUT OF MIND is an extremely consistant album.  Sure, a few tracks are stronger (Tryin' to Get to Heaven and especially Not Dark Yet), and some are weaker (Dirt Road Blues and the godawful Make You Feel My Love), but overall, the album is very solid, a good listening throughout, but without much variation and highlights.  Oh Mercy is much less consistant, but more interesting - the high points are higher, and the weak points more plentiful and weaker,although I don't think any song here is as bad as Make You Feel My Love, let alone as bad as some of the stuff Dylan gave us before and after (Wiggle Wiggle, anyone?  Or how about Silvio?)<br />Oh Mercy starts with POLITICAL WORLD, a strong, straight rocker that brings Dylan back to the territories of social observation he has mostly abandoned (and which are nowhere in sight in TOOM).  It's a very good song, and a very promising opener for the album,<br />Unfortunately, the promise is unfulfilled with WHERE TEARDROPS FALL.  It is frustrating that such a great title is wasted on such a weak song, filled with childlish rythem and fairly obvious lyrics (I'm gonna meet you where teardrops fall).  The singing in the chorus is somewhat annoying, too.  But, cloaking at about 2 minuted and a half, this isn't a major problem.<br />The next song is much better.  Some dislike EVERYTHING IS BROKEN because it's a 'list' song, but I think it works perfectly at forming images in your head.  The song pretty much rocks, which is usually positive, and the lyrics, deceptively simple, are quite clever (there's no use jiving, there's no use jokin' - everything is broken).<br />RING THEM BELLS I was familiar with, having heard it in Greatest Hits, vol. 3.  This is certainly one of the best Dylan songs.  It has a quiet force that is similar (and superior) to FOREVER YOUNG.  The piano is great, and the lyrics show tha Dylan can deal with spirituality in manners more subtle than he does in his Christian albums.  <br />MAN IN THE LONG BLACK COAT is one of the most discussed songs in this album, and you can see why.  It is powerful, surreal, and mysterious.  The music is quite haunting.  My only problem is the Waltz-esque way Dylan sings part of the lyrics.  I understand this has an effect that adds feelings of paranoia and Mystery to the song, but in my view, the downside is that Dylan's singing makes this song a bit too awkward.  Still, it IS a good song.  <br />Another song I was familiar with was MOST OF THE TIME, having heard it in a Bob boot from 1992.  The song is thematically linked to TOOM, and is superior to most of the songs in that album.  The sad reflection on a past relationship is both emotional and thoughful.  Clearly one of the best songs here.<br />The next three songs are the quiet, acoustic numbers Dylan writes a million of.  The best of these is WHAT WAS IT YOU WANTED, a song about a finished relationship, but that one is too long.  DISEASE OF CONCEIT seems like a good idea that went wrong in the excecution, and it would be interesting to see the song released again with new lyrics and revised music, perhaps on a live album.  WHAT GOOD AM I? is as unremarkable as the title suggests.<br />The last song ios the quiet, brooding Shooting Star, definetly a highlight, that also appears in Dylan's MTV unplugged performance.  It has a maturity and charm that ends this album perfectly.  The lyrics are engaging and challanging, and this is another highlight.<br />The most frustrating thing about Oh Mercy are the outtakes.  Two great Dylan songs, DIGNITY and SERIES OF DREAMS, were written during the sessions for the album, but for some reason were not included here.  Oh Mercy would've been aknowledged as a masterpiece by all parties had those songs been on it.  As it is, it's a very uneven album, and many of the songs here are amoung Dylan's best - which means you have to have it.
B000000WZ4|4.0|As Alan Wilder left the band after the making of SOFAD, DM was never the same again. Alan's musical talent was truly felt after the release of ULTRA. All the great dark, punctual synth sounds that we all have come to love was suddently not there anymore. Although, I like this album alot, especially more than the later release EXCITER, it still didnt appeal to me as it should. I love the sad, dark, and soft side of DM, but hoped for a few more songs like the old DM. Martin does a great job in performing \\"home\\" and the symphony in the background was a great idea. I enjoyed \\"its no good\\" as is the only song that resembles the old DM sound that we all fell in love with. There are other great songs like \\"sisters of night\\", \\"freestate\\" and \\"bottom line\\" that are full of sad, dark lyrics that only martin Gore can write. Dave does a great job on vocals and although I am not too sure about the new sound they have created, it is a great album altogather. <BR>This album is DM's maturity at its peak but without Alan Wilder's musical talent, as they didnt quiet acheive what I had expected from one of my all time favorate bands.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is my 3rd review for this film, and I just want to say again, that MOULIN ROUGE is THE BEST MOVIE EVER! I can't get enough of this movie, though it didn't win Best Picture and everything it got nomminated for, it still, managed to get the awards, for Best Costume and Best Art Direction. I am very happy for Moulin Rouge is still going to be in the Best Movie Category on my list, forever.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I bought this CD after watching the video for &quot;Last Nite&quot;.

This is one of the only CDs that I have bought recently that I can listen to the whole way through.
B000002J1M|2.0|FOXTROT has never been one of my favorite GENESIS albums.<br />Songwise, it pales in comparison to it's wonderful predecessor<br />NURSERY CRYME(which is my favorite GENESIS album). The progress-<br />ive songs here just aren't that exciting and the overall produc-<br />tion is weak. They got a bit over confident on this. My favorite<br />song here is Steve Hackett's gorgeous acoustic guitar instrumen-<br />tal &quot; HORIZONS&quot;. Damn shame it's the shortest song here! I'm also<br />quite fond of the LOVER'S LEAP section of SUPPER'S READY, which<br />is easily the most beautiful and melodic tune on the album. WIL-<br />LOW FARM is quite funny, tho GABRIEL'S on stage presentation of<br />this song is even better than the tune itself! I respect this<br />album more than I like it! The photos of PETER GABRIEL, with his<br />shaved forehead( an anti-Mohawk!) and PHIL COLLINS, who, dare I<br />say, looks quite handsome with his full head of hair, are almost<br />worth buying the album for! The lyrics are neat! or swell!
0446677450|4.0|Millions of us are money morons.  We make good money and spend it as quickly as we get it.  What Robert Kiyosaki has done has written an easy to read, easy to visualize book for those of us who are struggling.  If you have already got a good handle on your money, this book probably won't be that valuable.  But it's written for the rest of us who need to shift our thinking from one of buying liabilities to one of buying assets.  There are some powerful concepts for the average person in this book that can assist us in shifting out of self-defeating money management mindsets.  True, he makes it sound ridiculously easy (and perhaps for him, it has been).  For me, he makes it seem possible, and if that's what it takes to inspire me to get a grasp on my finances and to begin to accumulate wealth-building assets, then it was the best [money] I ever spent.  What this is NOT is a \\"get rich quick\\" book.  He makes it very clear that he spent years gaining a financial education (and continues to learn).  His message to me is that if I want to build wealth, I have to stop the old thinking, get some education, talk to experts, gather some courage, and start.  And I will.
6305910103|5.0|Hailed by many as one of the best Star Trek movies, if not THE best one, \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan\\" contains all the elements that made the series so successful. While most Star Trek feature films, especially the latest ones, appear like over-length episodes of the series, \\"The Wrath Of Khan\\" has qualities that put it in a league of its own in the overall universe of the series. With high production values, a stunning look and a great script, this movie contains everything a fan's heart could ask for.<br />  <BR>Some time has passed since we last visited the Federation starship U.S.S. Enterprise and the familiar assembly of faces. James T. Kirk( William Shatner) has been promoted to Admiral and is facing a serious midlife crisis. He is no longer serving active duty, while Spock (Leonard Nimoy) is coaching trainees in simulations and small missions on the Enterprise. One day Kirk is coming on board the U.S.S. Enterprise for an inspection where he meets most of the original crew members, as well as an array of new faces.<BR>In the meanwhile Checkov (Walter Koenig) is working on another mission, supporting a scientific project called \\"Genesis.\\" On the outlook for a perfect planet to test Genesis, he and his ship end up on Ceti Alpha V by mistake, a prison planet, and before they realize their mistake, Kirk's nemesis Khan and his exiled band of genetic supermen take over the crew and ship. After all these years on the desolate planet, Khan has only one burning desire - to kill Kirk and to destroy the Enterprise. He forges a plan and then lures Kirk and his crew of trainees into a deadly trap.<br />  <BR>\\"Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan\\" is an energetic movie that contains a number of great twists along the way and a surprise ending. With high production values and a scope that feels larger than the stories told in the TV episodes, this is one of the few feature film installments in the franchise that actually had to be realized as a feature film in order to be adequately told.<br />  <BR>While we find our usual suspects in the film in their well-known parts, it is noticeable that especially William Shatner blooms under the direction of Nicholas Meyer. Much less over-acting than in the TV series or the first Star Trek motion picture, for the first time we see his character Kirk as a real human being. With subtle nuances and facets, Shatner manages to finally bring to life Kirk in a manner that is realistic and down-to-earth. But in the face of such a formidable adversary as Khan, he'd better be. Played by Ricardo Montalban, Khan is evil to the bone and his stature commands respect in every single shot that we see him in. His voice, his mannerisms steal the show and like the bad guys in the Bond movies, Khan is the catalyst for this movie that ultimately makes it such a memorable film.<br />  <BR>Paramount Home Video's release of \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan\\" is a beautiful version of the movie. Presented in a 16x9 enhanced widescreen transfer that is highly detailed, the film is clean and mostly without blemishes, which is a significant improvement over the other, spotty video versions that have been released in the past. Boldly colorful the transfer conjures up images of galaxies far beyond that are both beautiful and lethal. Color delineation is very good, reproducing even the most subtle hues without distortion or over-saturation. Scenes like the showdown in the Nebula are gorgeous to look at with its vibrant tinges and fine hues. The transfer also has a very good black level, producing deep shadows that never lose their definition. Always pronounced, yet naturally rendered, the highlights in the image create a distinctive look for the film that is very different from the look of the series, yet entirely authentic and true to the series' original intentions. Together with the highly detailed production design that is perfectly reproduced in this anamorphic transfer, the video presentation on this DVD leaves a good impression.<br />  <BR>The DVD also contains a 5.1 channel Dolby Digital audio track that has been created from the original 6-channel elements of the film. However, the mix is not very aggressive and makes only infrequently real use of the surround channels. There are a number of scenes during which sound effects are integrated to make use of the spatial possibilities of the discrete surround channels, but for the most part, surround usage is limited to low-level ambient effects and early reflections of the score, to give the music more depth. The low end is unexaggerated and the LFE channel is engaged only on occasion.<br />  <BR>Dialogues are generally understandable, carefully balanced with the overall sound field, but the original dialogue recordings are sometimes a bit muddy and overly ambient. A lot of ADR produced dialogue has been edited into the film and the differences in quality are extremely noticeable in this film, as the ADR elements are much clearer and virtually free of the ambient reverberations and resonance that plague the live recorded dialogues. Hover, the age of the elements is audible, especially in the dialogues, as the frequency response is narrow, giving the dialogues a rather harsh quality that sounds unnatural at times. <br />  <BR>This is a beautiful presentation of the movie on this DVD, although it also shows clearly the weaknesses and limitations of the movie's original production - which have nothing to do with the DVD presentation. Fortunately the film itself is so engrossing and captivating that for the most part you won't even notice them, as you are absorbed in the fantastic story, the dramatic development and the action packed battles. To me, \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan\\" is one of the best feature films from the Star Trek series, and it was great to re-experience it after all these years on this great DVD.<br />Jon Reid
B000002UAI|3.0|If this was any other band, Beatles For Sale would have received four or five stars, but my ratings tend to be compared with other releases by the same group. This writer has always seen Beatles For Sale as a step down from the previous record because of the inclusion of cover tunes. It is not that the covers aren't enjoyable (the Chuck Berry cover was really rocked up), it's simply that the previous album (A Hard Day's Night) had every song written by Lennon/McCartney. This was an incredible achievement in 1964, so the cover tunes are seen as something of a step backward. The originals on this album are uniformly strong, and as previously noted, even throwaway songs by the prodigious Lennon/McCartney team are worth tracking down because of their unmatched talent for craftsmanship, and composition. Also of note, this appears to be the first release where Lennon began to show his brilliance and write truly meaningful lyrics, as evidenced by No Reply and I'm A Loser - the most depressing and tormented songs he had written up to that point. There seemed to be, generally speaking, more of a country influence on the record, as Harrison's guitar was strong throughout on songs such as Baby's In Black, and the Carl Perkins covers. McCartney seemed to take a backseat, but his one standout I'll Follow the Sun featured a beautiful melody. The song writing duo also crafted a fine single in Eight Days A Week. In conclusion, this album may not be essential, but it has enough to be enjoyable, and is recommended for those interested in the Beatles early period. Overall, a fine release.

6305252521|5.0|Ed Harris is great in this movie about a TV show 24/7 in the life of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey).  Who hasn't ever thought that they were a \\"truman\\" in the life they're living now (\\"all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players\\").  This is a very thought-provoking little film about deception vs reality.  Truman's perserverance shines through as he slowly begins to realize that maybe his world is too \\"perfect\\".  A lot of analyses can compare this to \\"the Creation\\" but as a film it stands on its own.  Exceptional performances by Ed Harris and Jim Carrey make this a movie that may have you thinking, \\"should I take that chance and move to an unknown in my life.\\"  I have watched this movie over a dozen times and each time it just gets better and I see a few more subtilties in it.  A must see for Carrey fans, this should have a world-wide appeal.

B00004CWO8|5.0|This production is artistically brilliant and imaginative. I was inspired to see this production after seeing \\"Billy Elliot\\" and being held spellbound with Adam Cooper's brief appearance. The choreography manages to capture the breathtaking beauty, grace and contained ferocity of male swans. In spite of reading other reviews, the \\"gay\\" aspect of this production never presented itself to me. The subtle symbolism of a lost soul seeking his own identity and yearning for freedom was clear. While the symbolism may have been subtle, the animal magnetism and masculine power of the all male \\"corps de ballet\\" was not. All I can say is WOW!!! I'll never think of Swan Lake the same way. If you were looking for something truly innovative, and thought ballet was for \\"wusses\\"...think again.  Bravo, Matthew Bourne...and as for Adam Cooper...there are no words!!!
B00005R2BG|5.0|Anyone who has seen 'William Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet' will already know Luhrman's love of visual flair, colour and passion.  His third movie is perhaps his most spectacular yet, being truly revolutionary in reinventing the musical for the MTV generation.  It is on the strengths of the director and the actors more than the script that really catch the eye.<br />The story is simplistic but nothing if not involving.  It has Ewan McGreggor as a poor writer who comes across the beautiful courtesan Satine (Kidman) in the Moulin Rouge.  As soon as the Moulin Rouge's doors open in a spectacularly frenetic flurry, you know that you're in for a rollercoaster of emotion.  If this sounds clichéd then that's because the story is, but that certainly does not take from its enjoyment.  As poet and courtesan enter their doomed relationship there will be few that won't be taken in because this is a movie that is genuinely magical.<br />Importantly, Luhrman didn't lose sight of the audience's need for humour.  In particular, when Satine mistakes the poor poet for a duke that she is supposed to seduce so that he will finance the makeover of the Moulin Rouge into a theatre, is laugh-out-loud hilarious.  This light humour bodes well for the tragic finale.<br />A lot of fuss has rightly been made over Nicole Kidman in this movie.  The only word that really describes her is luminous, and both her and McGreggor have fantastic voices.  Jim Broadbent as the owner of the Moulin Rouge is wonderfully over-the-top, which seems to have been the whole point of the film.  More than anything else, the use of catchy pop songs ranging from Madonna to Elton John establish this from the very beginning.  More than anything else this is a fun, over-the-top, totally immersing drama that is totally irresistable.
0446678430|1.0|This book could have been summarized on one sheet of paper.  The author constantly repeats the same (obvious) points to fill up the pages.  The &quot;rich dad poor dad&quot; theme was especially annoying.  I was completely sick of both fathers after the 400th reference to both.  There are a number of plugs in the book for other products the author is selling.  I do not recommend for anyone who is looking for practical information.
0553269631|5.0|Carson Mc Cullers has exposed to us through this novel, the loneliness we all experience, no matter how full our lives may seem.     The story involves the lives of some wonderful characters. Set in the Deep south in the 1930's, John Singer and Antonapoulos, both deaf mutes, and seemingly life partners, are separated when Antonapoulos is sent to an asylum. Singer takes a room in a boarding house owned by the Kelly family and meets Mick Kelly. A tomboyish 13 year old girl with a passion for music and culture. Being the youngest of the girls in the family, much of the responsibility is put upon her to not only watch, but basicly raise her 2 younger siblings. With the help of Portia, a simple black woman employed by the Kelly's. Who's father Dr.Copeland, stuggles with the oppression of his people. Always battling within himself and his children. A man well educated and sucessful being a black doctor, yet all of his children a dissapointment to him. Their lack of interest to not only better themselves, but also their lack in his cause. Jake Blount, a drunken, outspoken man teams up with Singer in a relationship left empty for both he and Singer. Both being very well read people, he and Singer can't seem to connect as Singer and Antonapoulos did. Biff Brannon, a local restaurant owner, unhappy in his own marriage that has run dry, has only a few fond memories to reflect on when his wife passes away. And a new life which he looks forward to is never quenched. As Singer goes on with his life quietly, each of these characters are drawn to him, each for their own reasons. Searching for something that none will find.    Mc Cullers writing style is very enjoyable. Each chapter almost entirly dedicated to each character, giving you a great sense of who this character truly is and what they are feeling. Also each chapter seems to be a little story by it's self with in this story line. This book is a fast read, easy to understand, and very clarified. Carson's use of southern black dialec is truly an asset in giving you a great feel for the south. I do recommend this book, it's a wonderful insight to a feeling deep within each and every one of us.
B00005JKED|4.0|and put it in the hands of a relatively new director (Antoine Fuqua, \\"The Replacement Killers\\") - it could be a disaster, but it wasn't!  Instead, Fuqua was able to center the film around the marvelous performance of Denzel Washington.  Denzel, who won his last Academy Award playing a driven man with little regard for good/evil (Glory), has been offered and has accepted a couple of decades worth of \\"good guy\\" and hero roles, predicated on his screen sense, believeability and physical beauty.  Passed up for an Oscar in the stunning, \\"Hurricane\\", Denzel had to find a role that would allow him to showcase all that nuance, all that skill, and all that bravery to play a role that is corrupt, sly, and yet that of a man that draws others to himself by his ability to take risks and survive.  He fills the screen in this role - from the scene in which he can't read his newspaper to his final gasp for breath. The only other \\"star\\" is the LA terrain itself - it is brutal and nightmarish.<br />Ethan Hawke plays the rookie, Jake,  he is trying to \\"train\\" as a narc, and there are some flashes of glory in his portrayal, as well, along with some excellent cameos from a supporting cast - but the film is really all Denzel (and his car!)bringing his own brand of justice to bear in a situation where he must succeed or he will be killed.  Starting out as subtly corrupt, you are caught in disbelief, as is Jake, as Denzel's twists and turns escalate with terrifying intensity.  Fuqua appears to have just followed Denzel's lead to anchor the movie, although some of the screenwriting and hyperactive pacing really add to the intensity.<br />When it is over, you are blown away - by the tale, by the violence, by the brilliance of the performance. Check out the alternate ending and scenes in the DVD, as well.  They demonstrate that perhaps the editing was one of the most difficult aspects of the film.<br />Training Day - a movie made superior by a tremendous performer!
0679735909|5.0|This was a wonderful read! Set in England, the story opens as Roland Michell,(a part-time research asst.) sits in his favourite spot in the London library archives, preparing to research Randolph Henry Ash's (a renowned and respected poet from the past) personal copy of Vico. Stuffed within the pages, he discovers personal letters of correspondence between Ash and an unidentified woman. Who had obviously attended a breakfast gathering of intellectuals, of which Ash was also a guest at. Who was this woman of mystery that had captured Ash's attention? Roland had asked himself that very question, and the adventure begins...I won't tell you anymore, I suggest you read it for yourself to see the mystery unfold. I can say that the Post-script brought peace, joy, smiles and tears to me! You won't be disappointed, I promise.<br /> This book is wonderfully written, A.S. Byatt's descriptiveness in this novel is brillient, vibrant and vivid! Her love and use of words is truly captivating. But keep your dictionary close at hand, you'll have a nice list to research through out this book.<br />You'll find two separate love relationships develope and unfold within this book, one from the past, and one in the present. Which is the only flaw that was found, as I constantly craved romantic involvement with the contempory couple, but was mostly fed romance from the past. Understanding also that the past romance was the main theme here, I still yearned for the present.<br />Between the pages of each chapter, you'll discover complex and amazing poetry, written by Byatt herself. Revealing to us all the extraodinary talents of this very accomplished author. I will definitly be reading more of her works in the future.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This is a true hard sci-fi classic, an intelligent story of a little robot that leads us to a far away future (more than Bicentenial Man) at that point the human race is extincted (or gone to other world) and only robots (Specialists, NOT aliens) remain on earth. Some people may dislike it because of that or just because its eclectic mix of ideas from its two great creators. Remember: is not a Spielberg or a Kubrick film, it's both.
B0000033OZ|5.0|ELP broke onto the scene with this one...  \\"Lucky Man\\" switched ears to the `on' position, essentially ushering in a new sub-genre.  The Moog synthesizer was a new technological innovation, a power trio who spoke the rich language of learned musicians...  they really were groundbreakers who eventually left the scene completely changed by adding so dynamically to the aural landscape.
0345350499|5.0|&quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; is, quite simply, magical. Yes, it's long. Yes, it is meticulous in some of its details. That's part of the magic.<br />To start, and has been amply stated, this book gives a wonderous account of the legend of King Arthur set against the backdrop of the Roman influx of Christianity overwhelming the Druidic Goddess (Mother Earth) religions. The book focuses on the women in Arthur's life, most notably his mother Igraine, his half-sister Morgaine, and his wife Gwenhwyfar, and the story is told from their point of view. What's interesting in this is that a war may last for an extended period of time, and all we see through the book is the group of women and older men running their day-to-day lives at the castle - finding food, spinning thread, etc. The depths to which this book presents life in the time period is amazing.<br />The brunt of the story deals with the tragedy of Morgaine's life and the lives of those around her. Decisions made very early on that affect characters decades hence is common here. It's very thought out.<br />Finally, the characters really come to life just because of the amount of time and detail spent on them. You really get to know them, and you feel for their triumphs and losses.
B000002UB6|5.0|This is the Beatles, it was their last album released. Maybe not last one recorded but it was still, in a way, their swan song. THere fore it is the most beautiful. The songs on this capture what this kick called bgeing a beatles was. And in a way they comforted their fans with let it be. I taught us what to do now that there was no more \\"Beatles\\".
0783211856|5.0|There is one thing that I think Universal Pictures could do for this film and that is to release an awsome DVD transfer to this.<BR>I have never sceen a better anti-war flick before out of the bunch. Everyone should watch this. The wideccreen virsion.
B000001Y2U|5.0|I am not a huge fan of Marilyn Manson, but I loved his album Antichrist Superstar.  I found that it had extremely good music.  I believe this is probobly the most misunderstood albums in rock history.  Most people believe this is an album about satanism.  This is pure BS.  Manson is using this album to scream a message out to the people of America.  You hate me so bad? I am the product of all of your hatred, your negativity.  This part is best expressed in the song 1996 when he screams out &quot;Anti People you have gone too far, here's your Anti Christ Superstar.&quot; Manson is a great preformance artist and song writer.  I encourage everyone to buy this record.  It is estential for your collection.
0345357116|5.0|Some people MIGHT think me weird, but UT was the easiest read of all the books on Middle Earth other than LOTR or the Hobbit.  It was almost in my mind another big story... Very well written, too   bad Tolkien didn't get to see it published...
0451169514|5.0|Words cannot express the sheer genius of this novel.  If you havent read this book, i pity you.  I dont care if you dont like horror that much, if you can put two words together you have to read this book!!
0140544518|5.0|My wife is a big collector of children's books. She has 'The Stinky Cheese Man' and several other books by the J Scieszka/L Smith duo. So when I saw this book, I had to get it. Boy, was it a good choice. I love it! Forget 'Politically Correct Fairy Tales,' THIS is the Fairy Tale book you have to get! Our friends have a 3-year-old girl who used to love the story of the three little pigs. Ever since the first time I read 'The True Story' to her, she doesn't want to hear the 'official' version. She comes over and asks for the 'Sneeze book!'
B00005RZV4|4.0|This live CD serves as an excelent review of NIN recording history. Also, as a lice CD it presents a powerful performance of one of the most innovative and tormented artist today. <br />Trent Reznor has made a mark in rock music by both the intensity of his music and the lyrics he uses to express his ideas. We must never forget that he is the mastermind behind all his sounds and that he recorded many of the original tunes by himself with the help of only a few (if any) additional musicians. <br />The challenge of any industrial/electronic artist is to perform live without loosing the intensity of the original recording. In this case, Reznor does not dissapoint as the versions presented in this live CD are raw and hungry. The live set did wonders for the songs as it presented them in a different perspective.<br />NIN nails recording career has been filled with EP, singles and full length CD son this set works like an organized resume of songs. The only complaint with this CD is that I regret that one tune in particular did not appear, The Perfect Drug is one of my favorite NIN songs and I have found it hard to find.
B00003CXXP|3.0|I thought the movie was well done.  You could see the dark and strange side of Kubrick throughout most of the film.  Then... that ending...it almost made you think that the picture remained untouched by Spielburg until the Aliens appeared with the jump of 2000yrs or so into the Ice Capped future.  I think the movie should have ended when Haley Joel Osmond was trapped underwater in front of the \\"blue fairy statue\\" Done and Done.  Aliens not necessary!  I did like the toy bear, it was a spooky. I kept thinking the Toy was going to get angry and turn on everyone like the HAL9000 did in 2001: A Space Odyssey.  My advice...sure buy the movie, watch it until you think it should end and TURN IT OFF!!! (The pause after the underwater scene)
B00005TT77|4.0|Soundtrack albums are effective when they link the music to the moments they appear in the original film so once you hear the album you connect to that exact moment at the film. Also, a good soundtrack adds extra emotion to scenes (like Tiny Dancer song in the Bus scene in Almost Famous) so their purpose become augmented in the viewers/listener mind.<br />With the I am Sam CD this basic Soundtrack principle is accomplished as the main character in the film (Sean Pean) relies in Beatles Songs in to put order in his life. In order to do so the Beatles covers are simple and effective providing the right support to the ilm plot. <br />Nevertheless, by using Beatles songs it is almost imposible not to compare the results with the original works by the fab four. In my point of view this is pointless as Beatles songs are probably the most covered songs in the planet so you either like the cover or choose among the many other available.<br />As for the songs in this CD there are a few the stand out because of the interpretation, emotion or overall stregnth in the performance. Across the Universe (Rufus Wainwright), I'm looking through you (Wallflowers), You've got to hide your love away, Golden Sulumbers (Ben Folds), Lucy in thye Sky with Diamond (Black Crowes), Don't let me Down (Stereophonics), Help (Howie), etc.<br />The rest of the songs are also good it is just a matter of taste whether you like them or not. This soundtrack is very much linked to the film, but after all, that is what soundtracks are made for, or not?<br />Enjoy!!
0385505833|5.0|This is not your typical Grisham novel.  Sure, the quick pace is there and the incisive insight into the character; but this is a completely different kind of book than he usually writes.  It's rare that a book makes me laugh out loud, but this one had me chuckling several times.  The premise is simple: Christmas is overblown, so when the middle-aged Luther and Nora Krank are facing their first Christmas without their daughter at home, they decide to skip all of the traditional celebration and spend their money on a cruise.  If you liked the movies &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation&quot;, this book should be right up your alley.  It's close enough to reality to make me wonder about the holidays next year...hmmm
079284632X|1.0|Wes Craven's first movie and also his worst. I saw this movie really wanting to enjoy it, however in the end it is just a bad, bad movie. As a matter of fact it is #9 on my worst movie list. The story is about three escaped con's who capture,rape and kill a girl in the woods next to her house. The girls parents find out about the killing and take there revenge. <BR>This could have been a good revenge movie, even a drama if Craven just put a little effort into it. As we saw this year with In The Bedroom, a fantastic film also along the same premise (they both deal with the loss of a child, and a parents revenge) a movie like this can be a good, serious drama.<BR>This movie is not only slow but it also has mabey the worst score I have ever heard. It is so distracting at time's that it take's away from the movie.
0440224764|2.0|I will let anyone who wants to read this book make up his or her mind as to its quality.  However, after reading it, I felt like I had wasted a lot of time.  The ending was very disappointing and very illogical to me.  Perhaps that was the effect Mr. Grisham was aiming for, I don't know.  It seemed to me, though, that the ending was poorly developed and completely inconsistent with prior internal character dialogue.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Daniel Radcliffe plays the biggest part in this movie. He is sooooooooo good at it too!
0380973650|5.0|I'll tell you what, go to a bookstore and read the first page. I'm willing to bet you'll have to buy the book. It immediately grabs your interest with the first page. This is rare for me as I usually have to \\"get into\\" a book.<br />This is a story about America, mythology, love, death, and history. Neil Gaiman has impressed me before, but I was totally unprepared for how much I enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it so much, in fact, I haven't been able to start reading anything else. Everything else I've picked up has been a let down.<br />The main character, Shadow, is left purposely undeveloped and mysterious, but everyone else (including the land of America that begins to become a character all its own) is wonderfully developed. Mr. Wednesday is a wonderful, warm engaging character that steals every scene he is in. Neil Gaiman has managed to create a brilliant supporting character that you never quite get to see enough of.<br />The chapters are long and I found myself reading a chapter and then pausing inbetween to digest what I had read. I usually rip through fantasy books at a rapid pace, but I wanted to savor every word of this book, so I wound up reading it very slowly.<br />I will definitely be reading it again. I hope that Gaiman will revisit this mileu again. If not these characters, then perhaps he will write a sequel about different people in the same world.<br />Neil Gaiman is at least as good a novelist as he is a comics writer.<br />Recommended to fans of Roger Zelazny!
6305508550|4.0|As many reviewers have previously stated, this is THE movie that defines corporate angst and fuels the inner desire of all office-workers (including myself) to harbor dreams of trashing the printer, playing tetris all day, sleeping in late on weekdays, and stealing my boss's parking space. Think Dilbert on DVD using real characters. <br />I absolutely love this film, but the DVD itself is pretty bland. There are hardly any extras (trailers don't count), and the DVD edition sorely needs some outtakes. No cast interviews, no director's commentary, nothing.... To make matters worse, I believe the DVD encoding is flawed. I've played it numerous times on my brand new Toshiba DVD player, and sometimes the screen will distort or colors will wash at certain spots in the movie, particularly in the beginning. But considering this is the only edition available on DVD, it's a marginal flaw and one that shouldn't prevent anyone from enjoying it.
B00005JKQX|3.0|\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is well-made and well-directed, but not inspired.  This is formula for box office and Oscar contention.  Much of the facts in John Nash's life has been altered, but that is not the biggest problem.  It is entirely unclear why everyone in the film goes out of his/her way supporting the hero (or anti-hero) who is really an anti-social nerd with big personality problems.  The audience is directed to empathize with Russell Crowe, not John Nash.  If someone less hunky, say Kevin Spacey, plays the main character, it will not have the same effect.  Many of the scenes are forcibly poignant, such as when Jennifer Connolly breaks down, Russell Crowe being accepted by his students and peers, and the Nobel accepting speech.  It would have been a better character study, if the director were not so keen on turning the main character into a \\"lovable\\" person at the end.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Despite its evident weaknesses and a very poor box office showing, I actually liked A.I. for its core themes, if not for its overall presentation. True, artificial intelligence is an extremely overplayed phenomenon in movies and television, but somehow this movie makes a worthwhile departure from the norm.<br />By the credits, it's clear Stanley Kubrick's original dark, foreboding and pessimistic vision of technology is squashed by Spielberg's more enlightening and hopeful cry for moral responsibility. This movie feels like a tale of two minds; Kubrick's deep symbolism and cynicism of technology with Spielberg's wishy-washy feel-goodiness are like water and oil, so I really felt the ending didn't do justice to the great beginning. But personal whims aside, the only glaring weakness is that fact this movie was directed by two film geniuses, both who stand on polar ends of a spectrum.<br />The DVD features are quite plentiful, and I found most of them to be true to the overall feel of the two-disc set. There are some very insightful featurettes that explore the technical aspects of CGI (ILM) as well as two satisfactory interviews with the two stars, Osment and Jude Law. There's quite a bit of behind-the-scenes footage that isn't the typical \\"PR blitz.\\" Those interested in the fine technical merits of this film, how Teddy's anatomic movement was simulated, and secrets behind the cinematography will find the supplementary disc to be very enlightening. The feature film, however, I leave to your own discretion. It's a rude balance between opposing minds that seems more artificial than intelligent.
B000056N8X|1.0|This movis is the last gasp of the old Highlander machine getting put to death, By the new highlander machine.<br />If you like the old Conner character, you will hate this movie, they turned him into the worst coward shell, scared...coward, and made the hero to be Duncan.<br />Not only forgetting about the past movies to make the new character look good, but tring to change history!!!<br />Adrian Paul may be a good actor, but if he was the focus they should have kept christopher lambert out of it totally, what they did to his character is [bogus]!<br />This movie has totally turned me against all roles with PAUL as the lead, knowing that he had a part in such [a] worthless...movie, that was built on the role first done by LAMBERT, and now wants to be the only one, when clearly the last one that is left, is CONNER, not Duncan!!  This [is not good]!
6302968100|5.0|Beautiful people,tons of death,romance,excitement,adventure,love and Brad Pitt with a honey bear bong. What more could you possibly need?
B00003CY6M|1.0|O Where Have You Gone, Lloyd Dobler?<br />The message of this movie seems to be that you should do what you want, when you want with little or no concern for those who may get stepped on in the process.  Zero chemistry between John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale.  You know a film is in trouble when the buddy-buddy antics between Cusack and Jeremy Piven can't save it.  This is old, unoriginal stuff.  The \\"quotes and trivia\\" section points out many links between this film and some of Cusack's other works.  No wonder it seems so worn.  This is a waste of the talents of Cusack, Piven, and Molly Shannon.  If you're looking for a romantic comedy that explores the idea of serendipity, rent Sleepless in Seattle instead.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I saw this film in the theater and like it. So i decided to buy the dvd for my dvd collection. I am obsessed with quality video and audio and this DVD [STINKS] ! I own an HDTV and the picture quality of this DVD is unaceptable. It completely ruined the dvd for me. I would expect more from speilberg.<br />If you don't care about video quality , then this is a decent movie, not fast paced, not an action flick, but an original story with good actors.<br />JQ's
B00005QZWJ|4.0|I knew before I'd seen the movie or heard the music that this soundtrack would end up in my CD collection.  I figured a composer like Williams, Horner, or Zimmer would be a likely choice, but was hardly disappointed with Howard Shore (&quot;Who?&quot;).  The musical themes unmistakeably derive much of their inspiration from Celtic musical history, and for the most part are quite well-developed.  The &quot;Hobbits&quot; theme, while melodic and pleasant, borders on the musical equivalent of clich, but it's the &quot;Fellowship&quot; theme that tends to run powerfully through my mind, particularly as I re-read the Trilogy.  Well done.
B00001U0DP|5.0|this movie is not only in one of the most beautiful langauges there is, but it is also a great story of hope in the midst of crisis. its got everything, comedy, love, thoughts on life. the kid is truly great with his expressions.
B00005KARK|5.0|This is without doubt one of the finest films to come out of Disney ever. Short(only 64 minutes long), but very to the point, and always pulling those heart strings. This is one of those rare films that makes me cry every time I watch it, and if you don't get all misty during the visit at the train car scene with Mrs. Jumbo, you need to seek professional help.<BR>What moves me the most are two things: the special bond between mother and child, and Dumbo being an outcast because of his appearance. Being a tall person, I always stand out in a crowd, and that's not always been pleasant. I have tremendous love and respect for my mother, and it would hurt me terribly to have her removed from me, so I'm deeply moved by the whole film, even thought I know it's all just fantasy. But, isn't that what all film is? Fantasy?<BR>This is just a short, sweet film with a whole lot of heart that proves that all is needed is a story, and believable charactors to fall in love with, and care for, and cheer for.<BR>Add this one to your DVD collection soon, it's well worth it!
B00003CXI1|5.0|I found the movie to be very true to the book.  It was extremely entertaining.  Michael Gebert wrote a horrible review of it.  Though i do agree that you should read the book, the movie is great too.  Reading the book helps you to understand the movie.  I'd like to see Michael Gebert make a movie that did better!!!
B000059Z8M|5.0|Before anything else is said, how often do sequels rate equal merit with their predecessor? How many are even half as good? Now, how many are better? Well, here's one that accomplishes that unique feat.<BR>This film features all the originals fromt the first film, plus some new ones, for example Buster the family pet, Jessie the yoddling cowgirl, and Stinky Pete the prospector. Again, the voice cast is superb. The plot is well-thought-out, and the pacing is wonderful. There's enough sentimentality to get you attached to certain charactors, without wallowing in it. That's a finer line than most people think, as too much sentimentality can be painful.<BR>The picture transfered to DVD beautifully, the colors are bright and well-defined, and the sound is wonderful. Please get this film and enjoy it. There's a wonderful lesson about friendship to be learned here, as well as loyalty. Absolutely wonderful!
0783225881|5.0|I got this DVD a week ago, and I still haven't gotten around to watching the movie yet - that's how good the bonus material is. The Field of Dreams Scrapbook is much more than it sounds - 30-something different chapters, each describing in detail a different part of making the movie. And the feature-length commentary with the director and cinematographer is great - lots of fun insights into how they shot different scenes. And they've even got the entire script to read page-by-page, if you're that much of a fanatic. Can't imagine how they could make this any better.
1878424319|2.0|Yes, this book contains some general practical advice, and for this I have allowed two stars.  However, I was disappointed with his teaching and `preachy' method in that it tells a person how to feel, but doesn't tell that person why he/she should feel a certain way.  What I mean is this, the author tells the reader not to allow other people's words to hurt them.  He says one should not take other's words seriously. (he's talking about criticism)  However, what if that person who is doing the criticizing is right?  For instance, what if it is a friend who cares about you and is pointing out dangerous beliefs or dangerous behavior?  What if the criticism is true?  The author gives no basis by which the reader can determine if the criticism is valid.  That's a problem.<br /><br />Yes, it's true that a person's parents shape one's worldview, because they do influence one's value system.  That part is undeniable.  However, it would have been very helpful if a chapter was included which would help a person determine if what he/she was taught by their parents is good and worthy of emulation, or if it is bad and should be abandoned.  Some objective criteria would be nice.<br /><br />Now, lastly there is the issue of pride.  The `method' conveyed by Ruiz seems to be self-centered.  Do we really raise our self-esteem through self-promotion and self-aggrandizement?  What happened to raising self-esteem through serving and loving others?  This is a subtle, but important distinction which is key to healthy relationships.  Ruiz seems to ignore this.
B00005QG9J|3.0|Sorry to all you Incubus fans, but I just can't make myself like this. The music (though heralded as being some of the best of our time) is  weighty and harsh in most places. I like a few of the tracks &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; &quot;Nice to Know You,&quot; &quot;Just a Phase..&quot; those are all good -even outstanding- tracks.<br />However, I thought the rest of the CD really dragged. REALLY DRAGGED. &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; and &quot;Mexico&quot; just didn't feel right and were a little harsh to listen to. Most of the rest just feels mediocre. None of the tunes are particularly outstanding and while some of the lyrics are intriguing, I found it hard to distinguish one song from another. <br />I like several types of music, mostly hard rock, soft rock, alternative and lite hip-hop/R&amp;B. I don't know if I would categorize Incubus in any of those categories. To me, this is elevator music. Perhaps you hear a symphony I'm simply too dense to observe.
B00005ASQ1|5.0|Quite frankly, I cannot understand that people do not give five stars! Sean Connery as the frustrated writer is very well chosen as he reflects a man full of life - as one other critic mentioned - but is frustrated as life has shown him that it is not worth deploying that potential as most people do not get what you write anyhow. Another William Hurt performance, no please.<br />The young black fellow plays excellent and any comparisons to Morgan Freeman and others I find far too early.<br />This film is highly recommendable to buy as you can watch it hundreds of times. It asks the question \\"what do we expect from life, what do we want to achieve in life?\\" in a way that it does not come blasting in your face. It is a mellow but powerful message.<br />Every serious collector ought to have this wonderful piece on his/her shelves. Go, buy it!!!!
6304509154|5.0|Steven Spielberg doesn't just make great family films and moving dramas. He also can help make a great horror movie. Of course, he had some help from famed horror director Tobe Hooper. However, make no doubt the hand of Spielberg is all over POLTERGEIST and the movie wouldn't be the classic it is without his guiding vision.<br />The movie is about the Freeling family, a typical suburban family living in an above average suburbs. Everything about the Freeling's life seems normal. That is until the youngest daughter, Carol-Anne. (Heather O'Rourke) starts hearing voices late at night from the television. She wakens the family late one night to announce that, \\"They're heeere.\\" From there the Freeling's lives are slowly turned upside down as small ghostly pranks such as moving chairs and breaking glass snowball into more and more frightening incidents until young Carol-Anne is kidnapped into the neatherworld by forces from beyond.<br />JoBeth Williams pulls off a wonderful performances as the distraught mother and Craig T. Nelson is a joy to watch as the family's patriarch.<br />POLTERGEIST is a horror movie that is remininscent of an Alfred Hitchcock movie, but with an extra heaping of Spielbergian special effects. The movie is full of suspense, yet actually contains very little violence, hardly any foul language, and no sex. If the film wasn't so frightening, it could be a family film.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is absolutely the best CD I have heard in ages.  I saw Norah Jones on some late night show and was so impressed but after getting the CD, I will be a fan forever.
B00003CXXP|1.0|The basic idea for this movie is excellent, and so are the special effects and the actor who plays David (Haley Joel Osment). However, the plot is more like a brainstorm of how artificial intelligence would affect the future than it is a story. The movie spends an insufficient amount of time developing the characters, and too much time preaching about the consequences of artificial intelligence. This film was frustrating because it could have and should have been much better than it was.
B00004R7TP|5.0|&quot;This remastered classic CD: &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; from England's favorite sweetheart Kate Bush, goes all out to give you your moneys worth.  The six additional bonus tracks-(there are 18 songs in all),  and beautiful new pics of Kate are well worth your purchase. If you already have the original version, sell it now and get the remaster!      I really enjoy listening to the 12 inch version of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;...the production quality is better than the original, and Kate had added some new twists to the song. I wasnt as impressed with the remix version of &quot;The Big Sky&quot; however its still an interesting addition to this masterpiece.  &quot;Under The Ivy&quot; and &quot;Burning Bridge&quot; are fabulous!!  It's as if they shouldve been on the album in the first place. &quot;My Lagan Love&quot; adds a unique touch at the end of the bonus tracks as Kate sings accapella in a traditonal Irish folk style.If you are searching for any reasons why you shouldnt buy this remaster of Kates classic album, give it up right now!  Cause you'll never find any that are worth holding back your purchase.If you are already a Kate Bush fan and you dont have the remaster of &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; then you really have no excuse not to get it. And if you arent a Kate Bush fan yet, this remastered CD is the perfect purchase to begin your collection!
0880794968|3.0|I own five versions of the Rider-Waite deck.  I don't exactly dislike this interpretation--if you're used to looking at the more standard un-shaded versions, this will bring out details that you might not have noticed before.  However, I find the colored pencil work more than slightly irritating.  It has the look of having been colored in by an amateur in a coloring book.  It isn't a very professional or artistic-looking coloring job. It's not atrocious, but it's not really great, either.  The use of colored pencils--especially as applied here--also doesn't ring particularly true to the age in which this deck was originally conceived, nor to what one would imagine were Pamela Coleman-Smith's original intentions.
0385474547|5.0|Things Fall Apart written by Chinua Achebe in 1959 is a lasting study of how one man's strengths and weaknesses are universal qualities.  So many of us vow to lead our lives differently than our parents and in that effort of identity and purpose allow the pendulum to swing too far in the opposite direction. Such is the case of Okonkwo, a proud Nigerian tribesman who is embarrassed by his father Unoka. While Unoka is popular, he is also lazy and fails to adequately provide for his family.<br />Okonkwo is an African Horatio Alger who lifted himself up from the poverty his father left him with to become an influential and successful man in his tribe.  Okonkwo is not without vanities and frailties. As he once lived in shame over his father's laziness and poverty, so now he walks in pride, failing to see his imperfections and need for guidance by others. He is rightly proud of his accomplishments and feels his achievements somehow put him beyond the rules and mores that guide the tribal life. This is a story about how social systems work to control personal behavior and the consequences for ignoring them.<br />Things Fall Apart is and interesting and entertaining look at tribal life in pre and early colonial Nigeria.  It details daily life in a tribe, carefully examining superstitions and laws which guide the day to day living.  Throughout the book tribal myths and stories are interspersed to illustrate how a cultures mythology effects there everyday living.<br />Things Fall Apart works on two levels. In part it is a character study which reveals universal truths for individuals living in any society and secondly it is a study of a society which existed prior to the colonization of Nigeria.  Both levels make this book a valued one.  It is a relatively short novel and a quick read.<br />I recommend the book for anyone who is interested in learning about Africa and learning about human nature.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|\\"The mind is a terrible thing to waste.\\" However, most of us take our minds for granted every moment of every day. The thought of losing one's mind is quite frightening and is the premise for the movie MEMENTO.<br />In MEMENTO, Guy Pearce (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL) plays Leonard \\"Lenny\\" Shely, a man who is trying to track down his wife's killer. However, Leonard has no short term memory. He can remember everything until his wife's murder, but then his mind is a blank. He meets a new person and within five minutes, he forgets. He goes somewhere then forgets where he's at and why he's there. To help himself survive, Leonard takes Polaroid pictures of everything and writes important details on the back. However, the most important pieces of information he gets tatooed on his body. Lenny's tired of living this way, but must keep on until he finds his wife's killer.<br />Pearce's performance catches all the nuances of a man who has literally lost his mind. And Carrie-Anne Moss (Matrix) and Joe Pantoliano pull off superb performances in their major supporting roles.<br />Christopher Nolan's direction is pure genius. The story of MEMENTO is told backwards. At first the idea seems absurd, but it works brilliantly. The audience is given a taste of what Leonard's life is like because they only see the story one segment at a time, never knowing what happened before. It makes for a film full of suspense, energy, and excitement.
B0000029DD|5.0|My favorite line on Jeff Buckley's gorgeous, mezzmerizing debut.  This album is so good, so taught, so emotional, so consistently intriguing it's SCARY.  Easily one of the best discs of the last decade, some would argue the entire rock era from the 1950's on.  It is certainly one of the most original and thought-provoking ever.  Listening to this for the first time was like listening to Nick Drake's PINK MOON or Radiohead's OK COMPUTER for the first time.  Jaw-droppingly fascinating.  Absolutely essential.
B00004WIBW|5.0|Johnny Depp plays an arrogant and inexperienced police inspector/coroner sent to Sleepy Hollow to stop a serial killer who decapitates his victims.  This movie was surprisingly better than I thought it would be.  Johnny Depp gives a very good comedic performance.  Good story.  Solid plot.  Good special effects.  Interesting coloration.  All around it's a very good movie.
B000007MVL|4.0|Kate's second album really grew on me. If you have heard her first album \\"The Kick Inside\\", and you liked it, then \\"Lionheart\\" is  shoe-in for you.  If you are a true Kate Bush fan, then you know already that any CD of hers that grows on you becomes throughly enjoyable. Kate's dynamic vocal capability tends to mesmerize its listeners, her talent for songwriting and playing the piano are undeniable.\\"Symphony In Blue\\" is beautifully crafted, in this song Kate overcomes her fear of death by the realization of her musicial calling in life, (she is-  \\"needed for the symphony\\"). \\"Hammer Horror\\" is another terrific song...It contemplates the hunchback of Notre Dame, its upbeat chorus sends a chill down the spine while you bop your head to it...\\"I dont know, is this the right thing to do?\\"...great lyrics\\"Oh, England, My Lionheart\\"..another Kate masterpiece up there with \\"Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake\\" about a relationship out of control.\\"Lionheart\\" isnt my favorite Kate Bush album, but it is a timeless work of art by England's favorite sweetheart. Kate's music is both beautiful and mesmerizing, she is one of the most underrated musicial geniuses of her time. I bought \\"Lionheart\\" cause I could'nt do without it...
B00005NKKZ|5.0|Alright, enough platitudes from the babyboomers, and how you have to be \\"over 30\\" to appreciate this album. Funny that this was the same age some of the reviewers deemed as \\"uncool\\" to be when this true gem of an album came out in 1970. I'm 28, and this album was in my parents' record collection as far back as I can remember. So, aside from the fact that I missed out on all those \\"groovy\\" protest marches (HA!) and that I didn't get to vote against Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972, this music carries as much meaning for me as it does for those who lived through it. When you are a musician, it doesn't matter how old you or the music are; good songs are good songs, and every tune on here is awesome. I always liked \\"Why Don't you Write me\\"... dig the horns on \\"Keep the Customer Satisfied\\". \\"Sol Long Frank Lloyd Wright\\" is by far one of the greatest pieces of music Paul Simon ever wrote (he'd probably tell you differently though!), and the title track speaks for itself. \\"Song for the Asking\\" is quite enchanting. The lesser known tracks that I haven't mentioned have all the makings of a masterpiece as well. There is humor, sorrow, wistfulness, all intertwined to make this a very emotional listening. So, whether you are hippie-turned-yuppie, gen x-er or just a fan of great music, this album is well worth your $$$ and time!!
B00005JKZQ|2.0|The actors are there, the idea is fine but it just doesn't come off like one may expect.  <BR>Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro combined would make any cop flick fan happy, but in this case the story line is so weak, with Murphy as a showtime acting wannabe and De Niro lazing his way through the movie as a an undefined policeman ceramic hobbyist the whole thing is lost. <BR>There are a couple of OK moments, but in the main \\"Showtime is No Time\\"!
B000001FS6|3.0|This live/studio disc is a mixed bag.  I loved the cover 'Helter Skelter' as well as other rarities like 'Hawkmoon 269' and 'Van Dieman's Land'.  But the live version of 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' is pretty weak IMO.  'Desire' is not the best track on this disc but it seems to be the only one ever played, which is unfortunate.  'Angel of Harlem' is a good track too.  The main problem with this disc is that it is compiled from such a variety of sources that it runs very uneven.  It seems like it was rushed out in order to maximize the bands popularity after 'The Joshua Tree'.  Yet for all it's flaws it remains a sort of 'snapshot in time' for the band, showing them and their music to be a work in progress.  Interesting from that standpoint, but not terribly compelling.
B00005UWBQ|5.0|Perhaps Jeff Goldblum is the main reason I watch this film again and again.  He's funny, witty, and sarcastic.  The action starts early and pretty much keeps rolling.  It's a very good sequel and well worth watching.
B00000K2SC|5.0|This has got to be the coolest action movie ever. It has a very creative and interesting plot, great acting, great cinematography, and best of all, the coolest and most unique action scenes ever, which have inspired many  movies after it. They even inspired video games, most notably Max Payne.<BR>Just put it this way, this movie is a work of art. This is one of the few action movies that I feel should have gone up for oscars such as best picture and best director. You can't be a serious action fan if you haven't seen this movie at least five or six times already. Take this advice from the master.
B000002UA0|5.0|Well if you truly like Pink Floyd, this is the only masterpiece ever released. I am only seventeen and I think that the type of music played by this group is the most fascinating in the 60's. Syd Barrett undergoes the ultimate psychedelic experimentation to write his music. Only two really good songs are missing from this album, &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play.&quot; But everything on this album is amazing and out of this world. Even though Syd's lyrics may not make much sense at times, it still does have the inteteresting rythm that was absent in the 60's.<br />Pink Floyd's originality is the fact that they use strange sound effects in the background that makes them so unique and obscure. This 42-minute album has everything you are looking for, the pure psychedelia from the late 1960's which has the most unique styles of all times. I recommend this album to the people that are looking for something strange. Overall, this album has the beauty of being experimental and lyrics which are based on story-like experiences. It is excellent and you won't regret it.
B000002BHE|4.0|I have four albums of her's (her self titled debut, &quot;Let's Talk About Love&quot; and &quot;All The Way...&quot; along with this one) and overall this one is my favorite.  It includes the hits &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot; which is an extended version and sounds better then the Radio's.  Also included is the hit &quot;All by Myself&quot; whic is a flawless remake of the classic Frank Sanatra song and the hit &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; (Theme from the movie &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal&quot;).  Other standout tracks include the title track &quot;Falling Into You&quot;, &quot;Make You Happy&quot;, &quot;Seduces Me&quot;, &quot;Declaration of Love&quot; and the concluding &quot;Fly.&quot;  Overall as typical in Celine albums, she does best in the beginning and close to the end...but unfortunatly has a case of &quot;filler-itis&quot; which is just songs that we could do without. (But she does however have good title tracks in her cd's) Otherwise this CD is a must have for Celine fans who want the Extended versions of her songs released on the Radio. I give it a B.
B000005RYQ|5.0|Don't even look for any of the other collections.  This one is THE best.  Besides including all of the major hits by this band-including the excellent 'Synchronicity II' which I have yet to see on any other collections-you also get a few lesser known tunes like 'Tea in the Sahara' which is great.  These guys ruled the radio in the early and mid eighties.  I remember hearing them all the time while my dad would shuttle me around to soccer practice...<br />The extra cost of this disc is a small price to pay for such a great collection.  Essential.
0783225210|5.0|Just because the movie is not funny does not make it a bad comedy. It's full of screaming, crashing, and fighting, which more than makes up for the lack of jokes, gags, and humor. John Belushi was funny in Animal House so there you are. The video contains an ample supply of videotape and the packaging will look good with any home decor. If you are the type that buys this movie, you will watch it again and again and howl insanely with laughter! I laughed so hard I began to hemorrhage, and that was just from looking at the cover art! A masterpiece!
B000002AZ8|1.0|After I heard Ten, I thought that Pearl Jam were one of the best bands ever. After I listened to Vitalogy, I completely changed my mind. Pearl Jam should be ashamed of themselves of making such a ...[bad]album. It's a disgrace to grunge music and themselves. Four of these songs are absolutely pointles, one with Eddie Vedder talking about bugsthat are all over his body and wondering if he should kill them, eat them or befriend. Dude, get a freakin life.<BR>The sad thing is, although this album ...[is horrible], these dudes are very talented. It's just sad that they changed their style after Ten.... Avoid this album at all costs.
B00005RYLE|4.0|I know everyone reading this is probably already familiar with the movie, so I won't go into the movie here - just comment on the extras & commentary tracks.<BR>I saw Bruce Campbell when he spoke at Mount Holyoke College on his book tour, and that tour included a screening of his documentary 'Fanalysis', which is included here.  I loved 'Fanalysis' (and I think I may have recognised some of the folks involved in it...), it reminded me so vividly of my time on the SF/Fantasy convention circuit.  Well worth seeing.<BR>The outtakes are pretty straightforward, nothing really funny or hugely gross in comparison with the movie per se (aside from some really funny scenes in which the effects just weren't working at all).<BR>Trailers and TV spots are also pretty straightforward.<BR>'Discovering Evil Dead' is ok, I guess, but not quite as interesting as I'd hoped.<BR>The commentary tracks, though, are where this one shines - specifically Bruce's solo commentary track.  The commentary track from Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert is a little annoying - they're poorly miked, or not aware enough of the mikes, and the track is overflowing with distracting and somewhat gross noises - lips smacking, small grunting and swallowing noises, and what sounds like sucking on hard candy, among other weird sounds, and they keep talking about the financial side of the movie, 'was this your idea or mine?', and how Bruce is probably complaining about this or that on his track, and they're just, frankly, somewhat boring and kinda glah.<BR>Bruce's commentary track, on the other hand, glows.  Bruce is really *real* on the track - informative, witty, somewhat self-deprecating - overall, possibly my favourite part of the DVD.<BR>I keep reading other reviews, many of which mention 'Within the Woods' being on this disc - if it's there, I can't find it (a shame, cos I'd love to see it).  All the same, in conjunction with my newly-bought Official Bootleg Edition of 'Army of Darkness', I foresee a lot of great late-night viewing in my future...
0064409422|5.0|The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, is a wonderful fantasy book for children around late elementary school, on through adults. It can be enjoyed by all through imagination, and it wisks the reader away from the everyday toubles of the world, into an imaginary land called Narnia. The story follows the lives of three children in England at the time of WWII, who have been sent away to live with a friend of the family, and elderly man. The children find there way, through the threshold of a wardrobe, into the land of Narnia, a land with it's own mystical problems. <BR>The children learn how to solve problems, in a world filled with extrmems of good and evil, and through their journey in Narnia, they mature, and are perpetually touched by the lives of the character in Narnia, and the difficult situations they have faced.<BR>This book teaches wonderful life long lessons that transend from the wardrobe, Narnia, into the real world. Maturity, and the ability to work within a given situation are all present themes in this book. Along with friendship, good vs evil, the power of sacrifice, making decisions, and allowing forgivness of others, eventhough they may have hurt you in one way or another.<BR>I feel as though this book is a valuable resource for children and adulta alike, as well as an enjoyable reading experience. I hope that schools, and parents continue to use it in their curriculum, and in their households ot keep the power of imagination alieve, and ever present in a child's life, through adulthood.
0736668020|3.0|Checking out audio versions of Sherlock Holmes stories from the library is as close as you can get to a sure thing, since Arthur Conan Doyle's writing is generally superb even in the lesser tales, and the interplay between Watson and Holmes tends to be more entertaining in audio format. I therefore pounced on this unabridged recording of Hound of the Baskervilles read by David Case when I saw it at the local library.<br />Readers familiar with the Holmes canon are probably familiar with the story, as Holmes is hired to investigate the recent death of his client's uncle at Baskerville Hall, a gloomy old manor on the edge of the moor allegedly haunted by a vicious beast. The very first chapter sets a wonderful tone for the rest of the lengthy story, as Holmes and Watson use logic and a handful of clues to guess the age and employment of a visitor solely by examining the visitor's walking cane, left by accident at Holmes' flat on Baker Street while our hero was away.<br />The mystery at Baskerville Hall is an effective one, putting Holmes and Watson in the path of sneaky butlers, dangerous fugitives and con artists, while being watched and pursued themselves.<br />Although the story is very well-written, I was somewhat taken aback by the strange reading by David Case. His British accents for the characters seemed almost intentionally overblown, as if this whole reading was a Monty Python sketch about haughty British windbags. To his credit he does make each character's voice sound different. For some of the characters, Case resorts to a voice so bizarre it sounded as if he was speaking while inhaling. There is certainly some comic relief to this presentation, and after awhile you forget about the narrative foibles and get wrapped up in the story. I give the recording a lukewarm three stars.
B00005R87Q|1.0|If you've ever seen Kathryn Bigelow's excellent 1991 surfing film \\"Point Break,\\" starring Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze, there's absolutely no reason to buy or even rent \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" since it's a scene-by-scene rip off of the earlier film.    The only major difference is that the the latter film substitutes the world of street-racing for the world of surfing.  Oh, there is one other difference, \\"Point Break\\" is actually a great film whereas the \\"The Fast and The Furious\\" is just a bad one.    Paul Walker stars here as Brian, an undercover cop investigating street racing who inevitably finds himself \\"in too deep.\\"  Vin Diesel stars as Dom, the head of a crew of street racers with whom Brian forms a friendship that threatens his objectivity and mission as a law enforcement officer.    While many of the racing scenes are indeed stunning, one wishes director Rob Cohen had devoted the same level of loving attention on getting better performances out of his actors.   Walker is just bland, bland, bland and given that he's supposed to be the lead actor, this is not a good thing.   Therefore, it falls to the always charismatic Vin Diesel to save the day. He almost pulls it off but is ultimately sabotaged by the film's weak scripting.  Talented actresses Jordana Brewster(The Faculty) and Michelle Rodriguez(Girlfight)are wasted in arm candy roles as the love interests of Walker and Diesel respectively.   The other characters aren't even worth mentioning.    If you've never seen \\"Point Break,\\" skip this movie and get that one instead.  Unlike \\"Fast\\", that film manages to balance strong performances and characerizations with superb action sequences.    As for the \\"Fast and the Furious,\\" the only thing \\"furious\\" about this film is how you'll feel if you waste your money on it.
080013558X|5.0|Now I need to settle this conflict that has been going on between the two Annie movies the Disney version is trash don't waist your time... here's a fact that I bet no one knew, its that this version of Annie may not be exactly like the Broadway Musical but it is so much more like the book written by Thomas Meehan. This movie is for every thing and wholesome thing in life it shows that the sun really will come out tomorrow! And need I mention the awesome actors in this movie I mean come on! who can get better than Carol Burnett, Aileen Quinn is by far the most outstanding Annie I have ever seen i believe she is exactly how Harold Gray (the creator of Annie) wanted Annie to be. Over all this is one of the best movies ever!
B00003CXSP|5.0|I know that there are alot of fans of the book who might just disagree but the thruth is there is no other director in the world who can make this type of a movie with style and substance.I can't even imagine The Silence Of The Lambs Jhonathan Demme doing this cos it's nothing like the first film.<br />You have to agree with the fact that Lecter(Hopkins) is no longer behind bars so therefore heavy locations have to be used to show the kind of life he would like to be in.Clarice Starling(Moore) also has gone through some changes and I did manage to believe the fact that she could actually shoot someone in cold blood aswell as be very intelligent,now when you put these two elements and bring in a supporting cast with the likes Gary Oldman(Verger) and Ray Liotta(Paul) makes the entire film worthwhile.<br />The film is detailed to all of Ridley Scotts standards and you know it instantly when the movie starts and you beemed into a mansion and while the people talk about Lecter and Starling your immediately shown a disfiguered man.I haven't seen such an exciting opening sequence since The Omen.It has some superb sets and beautiful locations and you instantly fall in love with Rome(even if you are not a cannibal).<br />The film centres around Clarice looking for Lector once again and leading grusome murders and mayhem Hopkins is in top form to reprise his role and I am happy to se him paly the part with a certain ease rather than  another over top roayal shakespearan performance.Julianne Moore who takes over Jodie Foster is exceptionally good aswell considering Foster did win her second Oscar for this part in Silence of The Lambs.<br />This is not a movie for the usual action film fan nor is it for the impatient as you may have noticed that most of Ridley Scott's films take a very long time to finish.
B00005JKYS|5.0|I'm not big on war flicks, but I thought this one was done right, very much in the model of Glory. I was a bit wary on going to see a Gibson war flick after The Patriot turned me off a bit, as I thought it was too long and drawn out. We Were Soldiers, however, had only one or two dragging scenes all movie long. Chris Klein from American Pie wasn't cut for this sort of role, but Roger Maris himself, Barry Pepper, was perfect as Joe Galloway, the reporter. Personally, I think Pepper might have locked up the Best Supporting Actor Oscar already...
0812550706|5.0|Card is a genious, but occasionally, even geniuses outdo themselves.  Ender's Game is one of those books.  Orson Scott Card creates a plausible yet terrifying futuristic reality where the fate of humanity rests in the able hands of a small boy genius.<br />This books gets into the psyche of Andrew Wiggin, a boy ripped from his parents and society at the age of 6 to become a warrior and a general.  Card deals with the emotional trauma of being isolated from society and the impact it could have on pre-adolescent boys.<br />Card's alien creatures 'The Buggers' are frightening but believable and Card figures out not only how a human mind works, but also how an alien's mind operates.<br />This is a must for any sci-fi library.
0440180295|5.0|Rarely is there more madness than when humans go to war and the most appropriate way to write about war is in a mode of madness.<br />Consider \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" a book written by a sane writer in a mode of madness. Meet a protagonist on a pilgrimage through various stages of insanity. Experience that his insanity feels quite sane sometimes. Think about a world where a slaughterhouse becomes a sanctuary. Ask yourself if you would not choose to live in the fourth dimension where time is timeless and death has no dominion if you had seen the senseless slaughter of war. The planet Tralfamadore may be the sane alternative to the planet Earth.<br />\\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is a fine novel in the tradition of satire and unconventional, innovative writing, best represented by classics like Jonathan Swift's \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" and Laurence Sterne's \\"Tristram Shandy\\". The book can be hilariously funny, but it is deadly serious about dying. In my opinion, the recurrent comment \\"so it goes\\" is just one of the ways in which the anti-hero and the narrator of the book deal with the horror and absurdity of dying.<br />Vonnegut's style is fluid, and the short paragraphs of the book make for easy reading. It is really very enjoyable from a pure \\"reading experience\\" view, despite the non-linear structure and the parts that read like a weird fairy-tale.<br />Of course, there is no moral in the book. What is the morality in war? Violent death makes no sense. Violent death is as absurd as life gets. And absurdity invites laughter. It's the only way to deal with it short of going insane or joining a cult that has All The Answers.<br />And Dresden, this doomed city - how neatly Vonnegut's description of its deceptive, dreamlike splendor summarizes his book: \\"The Americans arrived in Dresden at five in the afternoon. The boxcar doors were opened, and the doorways framed the loveliest city that most of the Americans had ever seen. The skyline was intricate and voluptuous and enchanted and absurd.\\"absurd.\\"
6305907145|5.0|I admit that I am an avid fan of Jane Austen and have seen many of the screen adaptations of her novels, but when I saw the BBC version of this novel I was bored out of my mind.  This version is much more easy to approach (not to mention needing a whole day to view it) and I thouroughly enjoyed teh charecters and the fact that the movie explored hwere the source of the wealth that the family enjoys has come from.  I watched this film with friends who are not austen fans and they also were able to enjoy it, and i know they could not have sat through some of the more sedate version.
B00000IBRI|5.0|This film has everything. Murder/mystery/horror/gore/suspense/chills and everything else.<br />The communication with bugs was different, but the killer at the end was quite strange.<br />This is a wonderful dvd that is clean, clear and the Goblin music in here is awsome. Suspiria was my top Argento flick, but Phenomena has alot more going for it. If you don't mind foreign horror flicks, then this one is a must buy!!
6305127638|3.0|So far, this is the best of the three Next Generation films.  (I'm really looking forward to Nemesis, though.)  The best parts of any Trek film are when you see the characters stressed to their limits, and the usually cool Picard gets really [angry] in this one.  The extra-vehicular fight with magnetic boots is very slick.<br />The bad thing about it is that they seem to have little regard for continuity with previous Trek lore.  The story completely contradicts the book Strangers in the Sky, the excellent Giant Book about humanity's first contact with the Vulcans.  The whole idea of the Borg Queen undermines the idea of the soulless unified menace presented by the Borg.  As for Zephram Cochrane, yes, he was mentioned way back in the old series.  But the scenes with him are rather corny.  You don't get any sense of the time period whatsoever.<br />Anyway, if you are at all into Trek, you should get this one.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This was an interesting, enjoyable film, particularly if you're into rock music... specifically the edgy stuff in the early 1970s, before Disco and New Wave.<br />Kate Hudson was outstanding.  But why did her character, Penny Lane, want to escape to Morocco?  Isn't Morocco one of those countries where they treat women like dirt?  Then again, that's how Penny Lane got treated by some of the band members.  Perhaps Morocco seemed like an improvement.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Hugely dissapointing, made for masses and childen with bathroom humor and stereotypes abound this movie was the biggest dissapointment of the year.  Jarra Jarra Banks alone makes this movie unbearable to watch.

6305229449|5.0|Mulan is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen. The story is wonderful, the songs are beautiful, and even though I'm 15 i still can't get enough disney. I love the songs \\"Be a Man\\" and \\"Reflection.\\" Let's face it, I'm a hopeless romantic, and this movie has a love story, action, music...what's not to love?
B00003CXWV|4.0|Great film about one of the biggest drug dealers in the USA! for some reason throughout this film i started to film sorry for this guy even though I shouldn't have! This film is about this guy who started small and ended up big... he keeps on getting busted but doesn't learn! This film is an excelent and i recommend everyone to watch it!!! Great film!!!
B00003CXXO|3.0|It was my own mistake, I did not read the reviews on this.  However, one warning.  If you are at all softhearted, you will sob through this one.  There is a reason, I say Frankenstein and not Pinnochio.<br />I gave it a 5 for special effects and a 2 for being very single-minded in its story.  I felt it was made overly harsh to maximize on the emotional effect.  It was too much.<br />A scientist gets a brilliant idea to make robots, feel love for people they are programmed for.  In this case a child robot. No specifics, but a means of imprinting a robot child's feelings to that of a family is found.  Of course this idea needs to be tested.  One catch however, there is no going back.  If this does not work out with the family, the robot cannot be reprogrammed but must be destroyed.<br />A young couple who's child has been put &quot;on ice&quot; to suspend his potential life, until a cure is found is the obvious in-house choice, for this &quot;new&quot; concept of a robot.  With much second thought and guilty feelings this family decides to &quot;imprint&quot; on this robot child, sealing his fate if this does not work out.<br />With Haley Joel Osment angelic face as David, you can imagine why, when he plays this guileless robot, it is all the more difficult.<br />Well, so as not to ruin the story, you can almost begin to imagine the rest, if I said it's sad.  I won't give the specifics away, but that it is all pretty believable.<br />I love sci-fi, and this was a well written one, however, I could not watch it again. It was too emotionally wrenching.<br />This movie is well-written, the special effects are breathtaking, and the story is heart-breaking.<br />The only feature of the movie that gave it some softness was a wonderful mechanical &quot;Teddy&quot; bear, a smart toy of the future.  I want one.
B00000761W|4.0|Whitesnake's Ready an' Willing is one of the best of their earlier albums before the band broke through to the big time.  It is also unusual in that when Geffen began reissuing the early Whitesnake album after the success of Whitesnake 1987, Ready an' Willing wasn't included in the reissues.  I think it may have been because Ready an' Willing contains the original version of &quot;Fool For Your Loving&quot; which they used again on their 1989 album Slip Of The Tongue.  At any rate, Ready an' Willing has some good songs on it, and it's worth seeking out if your a Whitesnake fan.  &quot;Blindman&quot; is an excellent bluesy ballad.  &quot;Ain't Gonna Cry No More&quot; is a really good sort of Zepplinesque &quot;Ramble On&quot; type of ballad.  &quot;Love Man&quot; is a bluesy song where the singer boasts about his prowess with the women, but it also has kind of a sense of humor as if he knows that you know that he's exagerating.  &quot;Fool For Your Loving&quot; and &quot;Ready An' Willing(the song)&quot; are two good songs that sit almost on the adjoining borders of hard rock, the blues, and disco.
6304143184|5.0|WOW just went to see the re release this weekend of ET and well let me just say it was very cool I have to say when I heard it was going to be released in the theaters with extra footage i said to myself have to see that.  I had a great time seeing the movie again.  It felt as if i were a kid again.  The theater was very packed where i went the movie was sold out and there was not a dry eye in the house at the end of the movie.  I was very amazed at what spielberg did with ETs costume and all of that stuff he redid.  I have to say when this is done in theaters across the globe i will have to get this on DVD to fufill my dreams of owning ET.  This by far was amazing their was stuff in their that i had no idea that i saw in the first release of the movie.  Their was a scene in the beginning of the movie where ET was getting out of his ship and they showed the inside of ETs mothership.  They also had a scene where the people that are coming to get him chase him until their is no other way of getting him.  But all in all i had a great time in the movie.<br />Referring to the Theatrical Release
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie should have won the Foreign Film Award, I don't know how in the world it lost!  I mean, come on, another movie by two Bosnians nobody heard making another low-budget, low-watched,movie about the war in Kosovo.  Amelie was truly inspirational, innovative, creative, moving film that as Gosford Park actor, Ryan Phillipe stated eloquently, \\"took me to another place and time.\\"<br />I mean, I'm sure the Bosnian film was well done and all, but every year it seems there's a come out of nowhere film about a war in Bosnia by a couple guys whose names you can't pronounce being nominated every year for the foreign film category. Was<br />it the same guys doing every year? Was this a Randy Newman thing where if you keep on doing the same thing long enough, the Academy gives it to you just for the heck of it?<br />Sheesh, anyway, the movie is simply wonderful, innovative, and a refreshingly artistic movie that gives its viewers a break from the usual Tom Green High School Flick, Mel Gibson war-militarization-patriotism- flick, and the Jim Carrey is this funny flick. Is is unfortunate that the Academy did not recognize the groundbreaking film as such, but that doesn't mean true movie watchers can't enjoy it and treasure the beauty that film contains.
6304712936|5.0|The acting in this film is superb. The story is wonderful, and it gives some education. I could watch this over and over and not ge bored. Classical music lovers will enjoy very much. Its really great for everyone. So grab a bag of popcorn and ENJOY.
B000062Y98|5.0|\\"Cannot be described with words\\" is an exaggerated form of superlative praise; though it's used often, it is normally not taken literally. In the case of Blind Guardian's new album \\"A Night At The Opera\\", however, no other compliment could possibly fit. I could write pages upon pages PER SONG detailing every last brilliant tenth of a second of the entire album only to find that no fair written interpretation of the quality and sheer mind-bending creativity poured into this album can ever be made.<br />That said, I apologize for not being able to describe any of the actual music to you, though these further comments will hopefully curb you to buy this album. I own over 350 CDs, everything from Led Zeppelin and Queen to Cannibal Corpse and Dying Fetus and nearly every possible form of rock, prog, or metal in between. Blind Guardian's A Night At The Opera is by a ...landslide the best album I own and likely the best I will ever hear in my too short life. Whatever type of music you listen to-- if you know where your heart is and allow yourself to be maturely immersed in your music, you will find that this intense musical journey is better than a thousand of your wishes come true. Young or young at heart, A Night At The Opera should be the very music that aids your life through its few and precious seconds; for the joy of a life equipped with it will never fade.
B00005JKHP|2.0|After reading William Shattner's STAR TREK MOVIE MEMORIES, I learned that the film was rushed at the end for the special effects to be put in and without a good preview for test audiences and thus the movie was released to theaters with super slowness in it's progression.  It is considered by most fans to be with STAR TREK V the worst movie in the series.<br />Almost a year ago, I learned that the movie would be given the \\"Directors edition\\" treatment, with that the movie was going to be improved, and I thought, \\"alright, FASTER!  It can be watched without falling asleep, it might even be good HA HA!\\"  Seeing previews online with a new remastered Enterprise and awesome new Vulcan planet scene (those dopey moons are gone with killer statues replacing them), I thought this was going to be great.  Thats what I thought.<br />Honestly, I have never been let down more by a DVD.  The menu page for the movie looks amatureish and dated, no clips from the movie or sound bites played, nothing.  Great title menu designs can be found in the James Bond DVDs or Phantom Menace DVD.  Secondly the movie is STILL too slow.  The effects still dominate the movie and we are treated to just about every single shot of (again) the cast staring at the effects.  Do I dare comment on the trip through the V'Ger cloud?  It still takes like what seems an hour!<br />Finally, I felt like I was watching the Star Wars Special Edition in the theater again.  I paid to see something great and packed with new effects and scenes and ended up paying to see something I could have watched at home.  As other then what I mentioned above with the Enterprise and planet Vulcan, this movie's only other reward is some touched up effects and sounds (along with a really great molecular walkway to get to V'Ger at the climax), and that was IT.  No missing scenes (some are even taken away, but can be viewed on a different part of one of the discs) No super improved effects.  I guess as another plus they got rid of that AWFUL and GRATING computer alert voice and replaced it with a much nicer sounding one and also that emergency (WAA! WAA! WAA!) klaxon is gone too.  But as far as improvements go, that was it.  I felt ripped off.<br />The movie if I can mention anything else nice is that it still is the best representation of Gene Roddenberry's view of Star Trek and the most scientific one.  I know that this wasn't a kind review and I apologize, but when your're expecting a steak and get liver, this is how you feel.  Star Trek III still reigns supreme as the best odd numbered Trek movie.AWFUL and GRATING computer alert voice and replaced it with a much nicer sounding one and also that emergency (WAA! WAA!

0618001905|5.0|I don't really like to read that much, but I was assigned this book in a Western Civ class as test material.  I was initially turned off by its length, and the fact that I don't really like history, but once I started reading it I enjoyed it very much.  Hochschild's style makes this book very comprehensible and an easy read, while keeping you on the edge of your seat.  Pick it up today.  I'm sure if I didn't have to read it for a grade, I would've liked it even more.
B00003CXXR|1.0|Well Here is what I'm going to say These are the wrongs<br />1. In the lost world they said there was no Fences.<BR>2. The pterandons was already out.<BR>3. Spinosaurus is a little sorter than the real t-rex.<BR>4. Spinosaurus don't look like that.<BR>5. It a Baronix with a Slik on the Back.<BR>6. The writers of the Films haven't been doing there home work on Michal Chriton Books<br />This was a Made up storie and it deserve to be on a low down theing.  Read the books and call it Part 3 becasue this movie was a NO NO.
0790729628|3.0|I was born in 1970 and after digesting the first 2 Star Wars flicks, I was ripe for Blade Runner's appearance in 1982. This film will endure for decades to come. It has a stellar cast: You can't do any better than Harrison Ford AND Rutger Hauer. These two actors should never be paired again if only to preserve the magic that they acheived in this film under Ridley Scott's direction.<BR>Having said that, I must disagree with those critics who poo-poo the original theatrical version that contained Ford's background dialogue. I will admit that until I read one of the other reviews, I didn't know about Ford's attempt to sabotage the dialogue so that the studio wouldn't include it. However, the film's most important moment for me is Hauer's previously mentioned death scene. Without Ford's dialogue, the viewer has no idea what's going through Decker's mind. Maybe some people can be expected to imagine that Decker ended up feeling pity for the android once he revealed his human side. Unfortunately, if Ridley Scott had intended that there should be no narration/explanation of the film, then the following seconds after the android's death shouldn't have lasted as long as they did. This is a pivotal moment in the movie, and without Decker's feelings being voiced, I think something is lost.<BR>I realize that DVD technology may have been on the cutting edge in '97, and that the studio may have wanted to capitalize by releasing this 'Director's Cut' as soon as possible, but couldn't Ford's dialogue have been included as an additional sound option that could be turned on and off at the viewer's discretion? Here's to hoping that somebody will get the message.<BR>This film gets 5 stars in my book, but I've got to give this DVD 3 stars, which is being generous.
B00005QHSN|5.0|I was blown away when I heard this CD!  As good as Vibrator and Symphony or Damn was, Wildcard has them both beat hands down.  I'm one of TTDs biggest fans and I can definitely say this is an awesome album.  His voice (one of the greatest of our time) is just as strong and beautiful as ever.  The music is also tight.  I paid [dollars] for this CD as an import and I don't regret it not one iota.
B00005YTFG|5.0|Whoever dubs this not a &quot;true&quot; musical is blind.<br />The music in this film is beyond words...no, it's not original writing, but I surely couldn't have brought some of the best songs together in such a format.<br />Were we to BELIEVE that this music actually took place in Paris, 1900??  NO!  It was genius to say the least.<br />This movie is over the top in every single way...and I think you really need to have that mindset to begin with to appreciate it.<br />I loved it...I was glued to the screen the entire time..marvelling at the effects, the costumes, the music...it made me cry, and that says it all.<br />Put your realism aside and absorb the beauty of this movie.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is just one of those recordings that everyone is going to compare in context with \\"where they were\\" in their lives when the first heard it.  For me, it was Junior High School.  The album had just been released and while cruising with my just old enough to drive friends I discovered this music that took weirdness and art and rock and mixed it together until you couldn't tell where one started and another element stopped.<br />The sound effects first hooked me, then the songs, then the story, then the guitar, then the production.  In short, this album has EVERYTHING.  Just experience it.  My only fear is that newcomers will read the hype and then compare it to the hype.  I'm just glad I was burdended with no expectations before listening.<br />The biography of the band at this stage is interesting, but not essential.  This album stands on its own.  It's the level of art that Townshend's \\"Rock Opera's\\" never quite reached.  Listen, enjoy, think, and enjoy some more.
0679882820|5.0|My 8 mo old daughter LOVES this book. I have never seen her react to any of her books like she does to this one. She laughs and giggles the entire time as the noises are wonderful and the pictures are great too. I am sure we will read this book over and over again!
6304698542|5.0|This review is for the DVD release of Cabaret.<BR>The DVD picture quality is slightly grainy, but overall quite good for a 1972 film with brillant reds and deep blues. The playful colors of the night club are full of warmth and life. The sound quality is full, rich and clear on a good home theater system. The DVD comes with a number of interviews and a making-of documentary segment. It is in widescreen format 2.85:1.33 with subtitles in English as well as several languages.<br />The film is one of the all-time sleepers that never got its due reward in my opinion! There is NO reason why each of you reading this do not own and cherish this briliant film. This is the best musical of our time, and one of the best films on the Weimer years of Germany. Everyone should see this amazing movie, I sincerely HIGHLY recommend this film! Rent, or better yet, purchase this DVD today!
B0000214F0|5.0|This is the meter of openmindedness in moves. This movie messes with your mind on multiple levels and is honest as can be about the very things we americans fear and even more shutter at talking about, SEX SEX SEX! This movie is dramatic as a porn can get with one exception there is more to this porn than just sex and it has thought to it. Not just some movie where one person says hello then the other and 5 min latter you have a sex scene and a money shot. This movie is not for anyone under 18 I would never let a person under the adult age see this movie but if you want a movie in your collection that like Moulin Rouge is something completely different and unique than this is your movie.
B000063NPX|5.0|I love Disney's Beauty and the Beast. I'm in high school, and i've loved this since the first time I saw it. THe music is amazing, the storyline is excelent and entertaing to all ages, and the animation is excellent (on the last ones before dinsey went to a much less life-like animation style). If you have any doubts about weather you should buy it or not, BUY IT!!!!!!!!
B00001PE4D|4.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The acting is wonderful and the background music is perfect for the situation. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but I would also tell them not to watch the last 15 min. or so. Overall A great movie but the ending was all to common, the ending you could say ruins the movie.
0807282375|5.0|The story of Lyra and Will continues in the third book of His Dark Materials. Lyra is kidnapped by her own mother, who is a wicked woman who had betrayed everyone. She claims to protect Lyra and hides her from the world. Will, meets two low-level angels that were assigned to find him and bring him to Lord Asriel, but in his ignorance, Will is determined to find Lyra. He meets Lyra's old friend, Iorek Brynison, the bear king and they follow the reluctant angels to where Lyra is. On the other hand, The church is learning about the prophesy and is now rooting to kill Lyra in \\"a sacred way.\\" It seems like Lyra is the key to everthing in the world. Meanwhile, Mary Malone, Lyra's scientist discovers another world. There, she builds a spyglass to see the mysterious Dust as it flows out of the universe. <BR>   I liked The Amber Spyglass. Who could weave a net so complex about the friendship of two children who are on the edge of maturing and becoming an adult. The growing pains of becoming a teenager and the agony of letting go of the past is fully expressed by Phillip Pullman's novel. I cried in the end of the book because it was so beautiful and so sad. Although I've only read the second book in the series, I can still feel how sad and how unwantingly the two children are separated forever. <BR>   My favorite part of the story was when Lyra and Will were in the World of the Dead. I liked how Phillip Pullman thought up of such a haunting place and how Lyra grew up in that lonely place. She was able to let go of her past and face the new future. Also, she finally understood that life wasn't only just fun and games, Life has a darker side and a brighter side. It need an adult to understand the true meaning of living in the world.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is by far the best movie of 2000. It does not use style as a crutch or substitute for substance (ala Moulin Rouge or modern art). It has an engaging plot that brings forth questions of identity and morality, without being overly clinical or intellectual. This film is not just some gimmick, and to dismiss it as such is to ignore the evolving emotions the viewer feels towards the protagonist as this compelling story unfolds. Far more thrilling than Insomnia (though that is good as well). As far as teenage stoner fodder, I think Time's Arrow is a great recommendation. Perhaps it just wasn't snooty enough for Berkley.
B00003CXSP|2.0|I can see why Jodi Foster turned it down.
B00005JKED|4.0|This movie was captivating.  Not because just of the story line, but because of the acting.  I am a huge Denzel fan, but this role casted a different light of his range of acting ability.  We have grown so accustomed to his heroic roles that this was like watching a new actor emerge from the depths of Hollywood.  It is a gripping drama of what goes on in the life of a dirty narcotic cop.  His analogy of the wolf and the sheep made sense.  The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the Vegas gambling situation with the Russian mob.  They could have visually tied that in somehow, maybe as a flashback or something.  Ethan Hawke was a bushy-eyed rookie who had good instincts to be a cop, but sometimes thought too much.  The streets are extremely different that what is shown on TV.  The only way to really know is by \\"hands on\\" training.  That's what Denzel was trying to give him.  His knowledge was tested throughout the day and he failed a few times.  Something about the ending didn't sit too well with me, but I couldn't think of any other possibilities.  Overall, it was a good movie.  I would recommend this flick to anyone that is a fan of Denzel and/or Ethan or if you like the dirty cop type of movies.  Guaranteed to be entertaining.
B00003CXRP|3.0|Too long, but it basically kept my interest, no mean feat for a flick with only I character, kudos to Hanks. Wilson was the best part.
B00005Y7AW|4.0|I will admit to the world that when I first got this CD, I was less than enthusiastic (it was a gift, and I had never heard of him before).  On the first couple of listens, the only thing that really stood out about the music was the production of it, which is unusually smooth.  However, the fifth time through, I absolutely LOVED it.  His voice is clear and dominates the songwriting, which is clever and musically polished, and the lyrics are wry and optimistic at the same time.  This is one of the best CDs I have!
B00003CX8J|4.0|Wolverine was cool, and so was Magneto. The movie was OK, but not the sort of movie you watch again and again. Will it bring the return of the super hero genre? Perhaps
B00003CXI1|5.0|I am a 37 year old pastor and had never read any of the books. I knew there was a following of rabid fans, but hadn't gotten around to them yet myself. I LOVED this film. It perfectly captured the feel, wonder, magic and life of Harry Potter. It made me feel like a kid again. Too many kid's movies are dark, or have a hint of sex or profanity thrown in. This one was kid friendly. And the extreme right-winger's (who haven't seen it) are the only ones complaining of the the dangers of this movie. (Remember how bad the force in Star Wars was supposed to be?) It is chock-full of innocent fun. I could watch it again and again.
0780624890|2.0|You will be bored. Tiresome and bland, this movie doesn't even try to be consistent: are vampires destroyed by sunlight or not? Blade's tiresome, self-pitying whining is unbearable. What was with the fat guy ?

B00005V1Y0|5.0|Although this, the first of Baz Luhrmann's triptych of &quot;Red Curtain&quot; movies, lacks the flashy special effects of Moulin Rouge (the third), it is emotionally the most honest and engaging of the three. (The middle film, Romeo and Juliet, is the weakest, silliest, and downright boring.) But what's clear from Strictly Ballroom is that Luhrmann and his cohorts (the choreographer and production designer he badgers and constantly interrupts on the commentary track) love to dazzle and douse us in saturated colors. Theatrical artificiality dominates every decision they made. Ballroom succeeds (moreso than Moulin Rouge even) because the importance of this artificiality is challenged...by the love story, by the peasant earthiness of the leading woman's Spanish family, and by the earnestness of the hero's commitment to his own dream--to bring something new and truly his own to his own little world, the highly codified and insular world of ballroom dancing.<br />The only disappointment (and it's a minor one) is that the commentary track was apparently done at or around the same time as the commentary tracks of Romeo and Juliet and Moulin Rouge. More attention is given to production details (and kvetching about the things they couldn't do because of the limited budget) and less about the story itself.
B000062TU1|5.0|This movie was one of the best that i have seen in a long time.  It was funny, adventurous, and exciting.  I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and I thought this movie was an excellent addition to the Harry Potter franchise.  I loved it.  People say that the book was better than the movie, but in this case, it is the other way around.  This movie should be one of the greatest movies of all time.  Even better than Titanic!
B00005A1PR|5.0|I bought this CD last summer after hearing India's first single &quot;Video&quot; on BET.  I was not disappointed.  At first listen I knew there was something very special about India.Arie.  Whether it be her unique music, which is acoustic soul/R&amp;B (go figure) or her profoundly deep, refreshing, and heartfelt lyrics, I was hooked.  I believe India.Arie and her undescribably wonderful collection of songs on &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; should have won her the Grammys that she was in fact nominated for.  While I am also a fan of Alicia Keys, I must say that the music and lyrics on India's album is much more original and unique than that of Alicia's.  I cannot recommend this to you enough.  It is MORE than worth the money.  You will not be disappointed.

0671004107|3.0|contact is one of my favorite movies.  it has content, something lacking from most hollywood drivel.  i figured, the universal rule is that the book is always better than the movie, so i should read the book.  i was vastly dissapointed.<BR>   the movie seemed to be more well thought out, have a more consistant theme, and have more parallelisms and symbolisms with respect to religion and science.  there were differences on the order of detail, up to major plot changes, and in each and every case, i thought that the movie version was far superior.<BR>    this is, without a doubt, a rare case where the movie is better.

B00003CXI1|1.0|...Unfortunately, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone\\" is the exact opposite. A great deal of money was spent on the production, leading to impressive sets (although more resembling a Polo-Ralph Lauren ad, rather than a medieval school) and decent special effects, but the main problem is that no matter how good the books are, this was not a good movie in terms of screenplay, editing and acting.<br />The result of too much deference to the Author and a promise to \\"bring the book alive\\" was a scene for every chapter and a rushed plot. The viewer could not warm to the characters, particulary Harry (who is one of the most loved literary chaacters ever) and the casting seemed to be on looks alone, rather than acting ability. The performances from the child actors were school pantomime-quality. I was also surprised at how wooden the likes of Richard Harris were.<br />That the movie was a box-office success was never in doubt, thanks to the fans of the book and the marketing hype. However, Warner brothers risk the entire seven-book series if the sequal turns out like the first one - especially as the second book does not have the strongest storyline.<br />My advice:..., get the young actors some lessons, get a proper screenplay writer to adapt subsequent books and make the next one stand up as movies in their own rights, rather than the \\"film of the storytape of the book\\". Alas, I fear it may be too late as filming has already well underway for the sequel... should be exactly like the book. but, they could have done a lot better job with it. there is a special feeling that goes with the harry potter books... they are fun, comical, mysterious, daring, and adventureous... that whole feeling that makes the books sooo wonderful was lost completely in the movie. i about cried when i saw it. lets hope they do a better job with the second one.
0060975768|5.0|Lieutenant General Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway have written what is probably the definitive book on the soldier's experience in Vietnam.  Covering the American campaign in the Ia Drang Valley in 1965, the book focuses in on two battles: the Battle of LZ X-Ray, where an American battalion held off attacks by a People's Army of Vietnam division, and the Battle of LZ Albany, where another American battalion was decimated by other elements of the same PAVN division.<br />The Ia Drang campaign set the tone for Vietnam, demonstrating both American solders' fighting abilities and the strategic failure of American planners who could never take the initiative away from the enemy.  When the battle was joined, the Americans would fight well and inflict devastating losses on PAVN forces, but the battles were almost always fought on their terms, at times and places of their choosing.  American willingness to fight the war on their terms ensured the North Vietnamese would win in the end, as long as their will to fight persisted.<br />But while Moore and Galloway touch on these factors, their focus is firmly on the young men who fought and died in the Ia Drang.  Moore, the battalion commander at LZ X-Ray, and Galloway, a UPI reporter who rode into LZ X-Ray to cover the battle, have done meticulous research to produce a well-written, easy to read account of the two battles that drags the reader headlong into the terror and tension of the fighting.  We are introduced to each soldier in turn, and the book is careful to note the circumstances of each American death as best it can.  The result is a gripping read, impossible to put down.<br />Moore and Galloway are to be commended for their hard work and dedication in writing this book.  There's no way to understand how it truly feels to be trapped in a desperate firefight when people you love are dying all around you, but this comes as close as humanly possible.  After decades of propaganda calling Vietnam veterans either emotional wrecks or horrible baby killers, \\"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young\\" finally puts out the truth about the Americans who fought and died for their country in a war few cared about.  It is a fitting tribute to all those men.

He is one of the most inspiring people on this earth and one of the most honest musicians. He is not intimidated by the realism of his own thoughts and opinions, and states what he thinks in all forms manageable. I admire him for this undiminishing raw spirit and the way in which he is able to present himself. This book is definately one of the best books i have ever read, philosophically as well as an autobiography. It is a power that he has to create art and beauty out of his own personal darkness, and this is something I aspire to accomplish as well. Thus he has been an enormous inspiration to me and will undoubtably leave a deep slashmark on the world...... I love Marilyn Manson...
B00000K501|5.0|this is a great live video show by rammstein, if you are a rammstein fan then you have to own  it, sepecailly on DVD, if you have a DVD player. it is filmed in Berlin, the concert arena is very very big, the crowd is involved in the music very much, and it has 18 awesome rammstein songs, which i think in  a way sound better live then the normal albums
0140185232|4.0|I am not a Maugham fan. This is only the second book of his I have read, the first being &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; which I hated. It made me leary to know that &quot;Razor's Edge&quot; was lumped with &quot;Human Bondage&quot; as his greatest works. Razor's Edge, although similiar to Bondage is about a young man &quot;of breeding&quot; searching for himself, is far less pretentious. It contrasts Larry's search for meaning and God in a post WWI world with the meaninglessness of 'cultured society'. The characters lives are interesting and the novel moves fairly quickly. A must-read for anyone searching for their own happiness in a meaningless world.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This soundtrack just got the academy award for best score, and desevered it every bit.<BR>Howard Shore is incredible on this one.
0790729628|3.0|For the record, the movie itself I would give 5 stars but I am saddened by the &quot;Directors Cut&quot;.  I so hope that the original will eventually be released so that true fans can own the masterpiece in its entirety.  I am just glad I happened to rent the director's cut before purchase because I was terribly disappointed in all that was missing.   I'll just have to wait patiently for it to be released as it was when I first watched it.
0671027344|5.0|stumbled across this book, and absolutely loved it.  Loved it so much I wrote a two page review for my school paper about it, and still wanted to shout from the rooftops what an amazing, breathtaking, haunting, achingly familiar, beautifully written book it is- I think there is a little Charlie in everyone.
B0000203Y5|1.0|Yes, I saw the movie. I had reveled in music like this on another compilation titled 'Cuba Classics: Dancing with the Enemy'. But the movie destroys the sense of how these musicians rhythmically mesh with and play off of each other.<br />This is not sopping-wet-with-ego rock music, for Pete's sake! This is genuine virtuoso Cuban dance music, but Cooder and his crew, when isolating each individual musician, decided to turn down the volume of all the other parts! How ridiculous! There were only a very few short segments when you get to hear how the ensemble actually sounds like. I mean, what's the point?<br />Many of the instruments (such as the piano) which are used almost exclusively as melodic/harmonic instruments in our culture are more engaged in for their rhythmic propensities in Cuba and Africa. Isolating them like this completely kills the sense that this is music.<br />And then oftentimes when the whole ensemble is playing, the engineer dials in so much reverb that it muddies up the mux. Again, you lose the sense of what Cuban music is, and how it sounds. What right do these guys have to make roots music sound something like reverb-drenched heavy metal? There's a difference between freedom of speech and free dumb of screech!<br /><br />I was very surprized a couple of years after the movie to be in a coffee shop here in town and hear some absolute kick-butt old-style Cuban music playing on their stereo. I asked what it was, and found that it was the the original 'Buena Vista Social Club' CD compilation which came out sometime prior to the movie and inspired it. This CD did not have the problems at all that came with the later video/movie, at least not the cuts I got to listen to.<br />Note that if you don't know this type music very well, the documentary parts of the movie are excellent . . . probably at least 4 stars for that, probably more.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Like many of the movies I truly love, this one might not be for everyone. It's challenging, original and does not spoon feed itself to you. While some reviewers have complained that Darko borrows elements from other movies, I don't think this movie is merely a sum of it's parts and I think it's ridiculous to accuse it of doing something that all fiction has been guilty of since hunters told stories around camp-fires. There are few stories, and it's the way they are told that make them stand out.<br />While watching DD, I was constantly reminded of another movie I saw earlier this year...I find it difficult to believe that Ghost World was nominated for an Oscar for best adapted screenplay while Donnie Darko was completely snubbed in every category. I loved Donnie Darko for all the same reasons I hated Ghost World. While Ghost World seems to celebrate apathy and selfishness (to me anyway), Donnie Darko rages against it.<br />What's most striking to me about Darko is that on the surface it's dark, twisted, disturbing and even a little depressing, but beneath the surface it really does celebrate life. I described it to one friend as \\"12 Monkeys\\" meets \\"It's a Wonderful LIfe\\" with an evil bunny rabbit. Ok, maybe that's stretching things a bit, but while most people will fail to see anything other than another dark, sci-fi, time travel movie, the open minded viewer will be deeply rewarded... Donnie eventually discovers the beauty and joy of life against inhuman odds. Life is finite, fleeting and precious, and Donnie represents those fortunate few who discover this in time to appreciate it even in complete defiance to the horrors he witnesses. It's easy to be positive when life is a bowl of cherries, but to delve into the darkness and emerge with hope takes real courage.
0767802659|5.0|Many critics, evidently unfamiliar with the work of Leni Reifenstahl and Frank Capra -- as well as with Verhoeven's earlier Dutch art-house work -- didn't understand the first thing about this film.  But ST is easily the most hilarious parody of gung-ho war movies since \\"Dr. Strangelove.\\"  Five stars.

B000002UJQ|5.0|There is no doubt this is the best album of our generation.  It even rivals old classics like Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.<br />This is Radiohead's breakthrough album, and marks a transition point for them.  The focus in Pablo Honey and The Bends is on song-writing and Thom Yorke's amazing vocals.  Kid A and Amnesiac represent a more experimental form of expression, using remarkable soundscapes and quirky techniques.<br />OK Computer represents a fusion of these two sides of Radiohead.  The songs will make you cry, the sound textures will take you to a whole new universe.  Absolutely stunning.
B000063DFW|5.0|I've heard of Linkin Park before, but i wasn't really interested. Then I heard &quot;In the End&quot; on the radio -- and I immediately fell in love with it.  Before you know it, I became interested in Linkin Park, checked out their website and learned everything all I can about them -- of course, I also bought [HYBRID THEORY]. Boy, I went crazy! It's the most beautiful rock album ever! Every track is well crafted. There is no dull moment. It's amazing. I can't wait for their next release.
0783223153|5.0|Michael J. Fox is great in this movie. He plays a con-artist phycic investegator who sees ghosts. This is horor and also comedy because he has spirits that live in his unfinished house. The thing he must do is stop a reaper ghost from killing people because he is the only one that can see him. If your like FOX than you'll like this,
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I saw this movie at a party with some friends and was blown away.  To this day, I still have not found a better movie, and have still not stopped thinking about it.  The acting, the directing, the sound, everything is amazing!  But best of all is Clint Mansell's amazing soundtrack!  This is, without a doubt, the best movie I've ever seen.  I've seen both the VHS and DVD versions, edited and directors cut, and they're both amazing.  Don't watch this movie alone, see it with friends, it'll be a better experience if you do.  We talked about the movie for an hour or two after the movie ended.

B000000993|5.0|...they pull this off so well with heavy bass lines not apparent in so much of the music of that time or currently and they really showed us that we could have a metal aong with out a whiny guitar solo. And that voice, the sustain is enough to send shivers down your spine. Songs like prison sex are not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. so back off but for every one who doesn't have this CD and wants to truly jam out and get violent, buy it.
B00005MP58|1.0|I love this movie - it's one of my all-time favorites.  I was so looking forward to owning this as my very first DVD.  However, this DVD presentation is very poor.  The images are washed out - the actors' faces are white with very little color and the whites of the dresses sometimes merge with the light backgrounds! And the music sounds a bit muted.  There is a &quot;Making Of...&quot; piece included on the DVD in which they use full-screen video images where the color is normal - faces are pink, not white, and the scenery is rich.  The contrast with the movie presentation is astonishing - you really see what your missing!  I don't recommend you buy this DVD.  I'm going to wait for another version which will hopefully have corrected color.
014028009X|5.0|What can I say, I loved this book and the sequel, but now I am ready for a third.  Bridget Jones still has so much living to do and so many adventures to share.  I love the characters: Bridget, Mark Darcy, her friends, even Daniel Cleaver, the [villian]!  ...
B00005Q46N|5.0|These guys are truly amazing. I have always loved Jack Black as an actor, but seeing him as a musician is even better! The songs are actually good songs. The music is creative and catchy and the lyrics will make you die from laughter. Being a musician myself, I would have to say that this is quality music and is a must have for all those who don't already own it....JB and KG, Tenacious D, This CD is Key!!!!
B00000IQW3|4.0|I first stumbled onto this movie some fifteen years ago on VHS at the age of 45 and have viewed it at least 20 times since.  It is STILL a pleasure.  Great acting - the incomparable Robert Preston as Centauri, Dan O'Herlihy as Grig.  Numerous minor simpatico actors as well, e.g., several of the trailer park denizens.  A musical soundtrack that sweeps you along.  Some snappy dialogue.  Rich and cute humor.  Delicious little scenic embellishments here and there - the hound dog, the cat atop the video game machine, the hypnotic trailer park sign, Granny with her shotgun, etc.  It all adds up to a rip-snortin' rootin' tootin' space horse opera.   FUN!  And you actually come to care about some of the characters. Even the schmaltzy ending, which is hokey to the nines, is so well done (including the music) as to evoke some emotion.  <br />As for the DVD, the video quality stinks.  Little or no better than VHS, although the wide-screen aspect does let you see more.  The musical soundtrack though is great -- crystal clear and with very deep but not artificially exaggerated low bass.  Your subwoofer will love this one.  The extras are educational and entertaining.  They include a homage to the then-exotic Cray supercomputer, which is pictured.  It resembles a modernistic Stonehenge, several towers in a circle, an object almost of veneration, which is how it is described and indeed looks.  <br />A great little movie and a flawed but still worthwhile DVD, which I wish had included the solo musical soundtrack.
B00005JKJA|3.0|Left-brained, analytical people should not watch this movie.  My head hurt after leaving the theatre trying to figure everything out.  Made me laugh the more I thought about the movie afterward.  I would like to know where she got her brand of lipstick that stayed on so perfectly (even in the shower) throughout the entire movie.
B00003CY0V|4.0|A number of my 'non-technical' friends recommended this movie to me as one I would perhaps enjoy.  Being the type of person who enjoyed &quot;The Matrix&quot; and numerous other similarly-styled movies, I thought I would give it a try.<br />What I found was a movie that, for the most part was fairly enjoyable, it didn't quite live up to the hype.  Sure, it occasionally flirted with greatness, but never got any farther.<br />The movie revolves around a dual-plot of espionage and divorce, with the main character trapped in two very different worlds.  The technical aspects (and flaws) aside, I felt the emotional development of the main character between his daughter to be rather weak.  The viewer wasn't drawn into the story such that the suspense of the unknown was truly deep.<br />Could I be a true geek and rip apart the movie technically?  Sure, but what fun is that?!  The only thing I will say on this point: the main character (a 'hacker'), NEVER uses the space bar.  How real is that?<br />If you want a fun movie with mutilple plot twists and turns with a somewhat disjointed dual-plot, mixed in with some very good special effects and rather cool acting (particularly with John Travolta), then this movie is for you.  I enjoyed it, but am not in a hurry to see it again.
B000001F3C|4.0|Okay real war isn't but this was the first big step U2 made. They had made two albums before this, Boy and October. This though shot them into the limelight for the first time. The first U2 song I ever heard was \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" back in 1991. It helped define U2 I think in many ways. It still has a lasting effect on the band.(As it does for me too. It made me start listening to hard rock music for the first time.) It was their first political song and of course now will be one of many.<BR>War is a great album almost worthy of classic status. From that opening drum piece in \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" to \\"40\\" this cd brought up the arena pounding U2. \\"New Year's Day\\" is a great song and one of the band's best. Next comes a song that many have overlooked \\"Like a Song..\\" which I think is a very good song. \\"Drowning Man\\" is a wonderful slow song that sounds great. \\"Two Hearts\\" and \\"Surrender\\" also help show that U2 can also do some good ballad type songs as well as rockers. And \\"40\\" is a great end to this pounding vision that U2 started. U2 will always be remembered for three albums: Achtung, Joshua Tree, and War. I think All That You Can't Leave Behind might be in that group. But let's see how it handles the test of time.

B00005JKED|5.0|I saw A Beautiful Mind and thought that Russell Crow should have received the best actor award until I saw Denzel Washingtington in Training Day! That performance was not expected from a Denzel Movie. This is why I feel that he SHOULD HAVE WON the Oscar for best actor. I was feeling at first that this was a token Oscar until I saw the move on DVD last night over a friends. I am now purchasing this DVD for my collection! BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE AND DESERVING OF THE BEST ACTOR AWARD (IMO)!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I have to admit that in the first 15 minutes of watching &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; I thought that it was very strange!  But after finishing the movie I realized that &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is so different than any of the movies I've seen and one should appreciate and be aware of it's differences rather than just critizing it.<br />This movie is not one you can only see once!  Each time you  watch the movie it gives you more surprises and it's so amazing how everything connects!  The music, plot, costumes, colors, acting, setting...everything all blends in so well! Good job Baz Lurhmann!  I give &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; five stars!
B00005LMWI|5.0|I bought Kamelot's Karma CD yesterday...and I've been listening to it virtually non-stop since. I'm nearly speechless.<br />Where do I begin to sing the praises of Kamelot?<br />Khan's voice is astounding. He's a combination of Geoff Tate and John Schlitt (a highly underrated rock singer, most recently of Petra), with a bit of Timo Kotipelto (Stratovarius) thrown in for good measure. <br />Guitarist Thomas Youngblood isn't a shredder the way Symphony X's Michael Romeo or Stratovarius' Timo Tolkki are, but he has a powerful, melodic style that I like very much nonetheless. Best of all, he's a true renaissance guitarist, equally at home on an electric, classical or acoustic guitar. Very few guitarists these days are that accomplished.<br />The songs on Karma are deep, creative, beautiful and sometimes complex without being overpowering the way Symphony X or Dream Theater can get.<br />I wouldn't call this prog metal. Symphonic metal is more like it. Or symphonic power metal. Whatever label you care to give it, this is extremely moving music.<br />It's hard to pick a favorite song, but I like the melody and brisk pace of &quot;Across the Highlands.&quot;<br />Other favorites include &quot;Forever,&quot; &quot;Requiem for the Innocent,&quot; &quot;Fall from Grace&quot; and even &quot;Ne Pleure Pas,&quot; the  U.S. Bonus track, sung in French (with beautiful strings and classical guitar accompaniment).<br />Another surprise: This isn't a European power metal band. These guys are from Florida! Unbelievable. I had no freakin' clue that American bands were this good. Aside from Symphony X, I really didn't know any symphonic power prog/metal bands hailed from the States.<br />I'm going to waste no time ordering Kamelot's back catalog (I think they have five other CDs)...and keeping a watch on the concert circuit for a gig close to Michigan. This is truly a must-see band!

B00005V3Z4|4.0|When the movie ended, I was left with a sense of disappointment. The plotlines don't wrap up in a convenient little bundle and I had many more questions I wanted answered. This ambiguity is a strength; it makes the exploration of the movie's meaning and reality enjoyable. The initial disappointment is a small price to pay for such an interesting and unique story.
0385501560|4.0|If you've read Chuck's other three novels, you'll quickly catch on to some of his old tricks. A disenfranchised protagonist with an identity crisis who attends weekly support groups and makes his living off of some clever scam. A narrator with a miniscule attention span, a catch phrase repeated dozens of times throughout the story, a compendium of disturbing factoids from the shadowy underbelly of American life.<br />Despite such oft-revisited themes, Palahniuk manages to deliver another addicting story in Choke, with even a couple more surprises. He's taken elements from his first few efforts and perfected his style in many ways.<br />One big weakness is the book's climax and resolution. Toward the end of the novel, it seems Chuck had written himself into a corner and couldn't think of a good vehicle to carry the last few chapters. The tale digresses into an overly abstract (even for him) subplot about rock collecting, seemingly in order to wrap up the story with a symbolic illustration of the book's central \\"message.\\"<br />Palahniuk fans will like this novel for the same reasons they got hooked on his writing to begin with. At the same time, a breath of fresh air would sure be nice.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is the movie where you can find music from such diverse artists like Madonna (in a rather comic performance of &quot;Like a virgin&quot;), Queen (&quot;Show must go on&quot;), Police (a dazzling tango version of &quot;Roxanne&quot;), The Beatles (a brief mention to &quot;All you need is love&quot;) and even... Nirvana (in a surprising version of &quot;Smells like teen spirit&quot; with slightly altered lyrics).<br />The plot is as simple as it gets: A young and talented bohemian writer (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with Satin (Nicole Kidman), a dance hall girl who dreams of becoming a real actress. The bad guy of the plot, a.k.a. the Duke (Richard Boxburgh), is willing to realize her dreams, but only if he can win or buy her love.<br />I have to admit it: I am not a big fan of musicals and therefore not sure if I'd enjoy the movie. But Moulin Rouge is a motion picture that requests your full attention, and if you choose to give it, then you are in for a thrilling ride.<br />I was rather surprised with the fact that the director (Buz Luhrmann) was not nominated for an Oscar. Ok, the cinematography and the costumes surely deserve the acknowledgement, but such an extravagant spectacle could easily have gotten out of control, if not in the hands of a skilled director.<br />In any case, enjoy the surprisingly expressive voice of Ewan McGregor, the comic touch that Nicole Kidman instills in her part, the so fitting over the top performances of the supporting cast. But at the end, just close your eyes and forget about the vivid colors and loud music, because Moulin Rouge is above all a powerful love story.
B00003CXDZ|2.0|Baz Luhrmann deserves credit for his bravado, but he scores zero points for making a chaotic, excessive, in-your-face movie which is essentially one big mess.  The movie is frantic and jittery in its pacing and is filled with self-indulgent rapid-fire camera movements and editing which does NOT ENHANCE the story in anyway.  Rather it DETRACTS from it.<br />It gives the viewer a throbbing headache rather than touching one's heart or stimulating the viewer's intellect.<br />Nicole Kidman is lovely and she has a beautiful singing voice.  But Ewan McGregor, handsome as he is, has a loud, colorless voice which lacks any nuance or subtletly.<br />On the plus side, the sets and costumes are quite spectacular, but the movie as a whole is trying too hard to \\"redefine\\" the musical so that \\"Moulin Rouge\\" loses coherence or poignancy.  Sometimes less is more.
078322818X|5.0|Just think.  If this film had tanked, we would have never experienced the pleasures of Laverne and Shirley, Joanie Loves Chachie, and JarJar Binks.  Hmmm.  Maybe it was not such a good thing this movie was successful.<br />Take two.<br />Just think.  If this film had tanked, we probably would have never had the TV show Happy Days, or the whole Star Wars phenomenon.  Now Happy Days had it's share of stupidity, but it also grabbed our cultural attention for many years.  And the Star Wars series grabbed this country like nothing before or since.  <br />It all came about because George Lucas's rememberances of his youth earned such a big bundle of money that he was allowed to make his little space epic.  It made a lot of money because it captured the way we want to feel about a certain part of our history.  Maybe it's a little more romanticized than reality, but that's the movies for you.  And no matter how old we are when we watch it, we want to be the age of the characters when this all occurred.<br />The movie is a classic because it lets six distinct stereotypes be fleshed out as living human beings:  the intellectual, the class president, the greaser, the nerd, the good girl, the not-so-good girl.  We get to see all of them express their best and worst behavior, and in doing so, got to understand why it is they act this way.  Compare that to the portrayals of teenagers in most movies.  <br />Of course, the movie wouldn't have been anywhere near the classic it was if it weren't for the virtual wall-to-wall soundtrack.  In this case, I don't mind at all that established hits were used (vs. an original soundtrack).  This is the music they were listening to at the time, and each song was chosen correctly for the mood of the movie at the time.  <br />This is a movie that has respect for it's young characters.  I can't say that about most of the movies I see these days.
B00005QW5X|4.0|My initial preconception upon hearing descriptions was, &quot;oh, more gender bending pop camp. Thanks, but i saw Rocky Horror enough in my 20's&quot; This said, upon seeing the movie and having an admittedly emotional reaction to it, I have to say that this is not the kind of frivolous camp you might presume. Its also goes a ways beyond the prima facie subject matter of gender roles. It's full of  intelligent, dry wit,  crisp satire and of course undeniable rock music that is, honestly, so good it transcends anachronism.  Its true the ending was somewhat ad-hoc, but if you make it that far, you won't care.  <br />Long story short: <br />If you are uncomfortable with gender-based subculture, see it anyway. If have a natural aversion to rock musicals (or just musicals)  see it anyway. If you're an aging rocker and left that all behind for a reason, (leave the kids with your sister and ) see it anyway. If you just can't stand emotionally intense and honest rock music, then there's nothing I can help you with but to suggest (the charmingly sweet and pretty) Moulin Rouge.
B00005RYP7|2.0|... The young actress who made her mark ...in \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" has now become more voluptuous, and Hollywood is apparantly full speed ahead in getting her wet and unclothed in \\"serious\\" movies. <br />I am giving away no plot by saying this is one of those films where the main characters are put into a new situation that turns out to be menacing.  Usually, these films show things going fine, and small things start happening to make the heroes start wondering what they got themselves into.  This movie doesn't waste time with such formalities. <br />The plot concerns a slilghtly rebellious teenager and her younger brother all of a sudden becoming orphans.  They are immediately given sympathetic offers of help from all sides by various relatives and acquaintences.  Problem is that each offer seems to come with a leering or menacing look from the offerer, which naturally makes her more uncomfortable.  <br />For whatever reason, they choose to come live with a couple who seem to be a friend of the family, even after getting an offer from a blood relative.  Maybe it's because the friends of the family live in a multi-million, state-of-the-art, everything-always-in-its-place ...[sea-side] mansion.  But instead of at least appearing like a decent deal from the beginning, the couple seems creepy right from the start. ...<br />And the couple is not just plain creepy.  They are domineering, self destructive creeps who are pretty much portrayed as evil from day one.  This could still possibly work in a movie if they would have brought in some buckets of horror and terror a lot earlier into the movie.  But it doesn't.  ...<br />... If they wanted to make a good movie, it should have been a lot more intense a lot quicker, and they should have kept the intensity throughout.  But they took it easy, and figured if you are content to watch a nineteen-year-old play a sixteen-year-old, you'll buy a ticket.

B0000009SI|5.0|This, and \\"Joe's Garage, Act I\\", are my favorite Frank Zappa albums.  I have more copies of his work than just about any artist other than Bob Dylan, so I've heard a good history of this stuff.  I realize there are musical afficionados that would rather listen to just his guitar work, and that's fine.  This is the kind of Frank Zappa music I was introduced to, and while I appreciate the guitar work, it's the funny story-telling that brings me consistently back for more.  <br />The period seems to be definately his commercial peak, and I think there's an arguement that it could be his musical peak also.  Maybe not in the complexity of the songs (that's for the guitar afficionados to debate), but where it came all together with writing and having a crack set of musicians to help record it.  In his early years, he didn't even have true musicians in the orginal Mothers of Invention, and things got stalled as the band members had to learn their pieces by rote.  No such problem here, as he has real pros to work with.<br />I wish every Frank Zappa album were done like this, but he never equalled it until \\"Joe's Garage I\\".  I wish every instrumental were like the title song.  This album takes you into a world that we almost never see in recorded music, even though I keep looking.  I really was bummed out when he died.
B00005JGAB|5.0|Countless great albums were released in the '70s, but by 1977 something was missing in the rock and roll universe. Rock was big, glammy, and excessive, lack all the raw simplicity that made it great in the first place. Enter the Ramones.The Ramones brought rock back to its raw roots, and at the same time made the greatest punk rock album EVER!<br />One thing that makes the Ramones debut album so great and legendary is that it is just so much fun! All 14 songs on the original album is great (With the exception of I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend), and could easily fit into a DJ's party list. (Hell if you go to the party and Hey Ho Let's Go is not heard, it ain't worth your time!) Joey Ramone is the image (not to mention the voice) of punk rock, leather clad, ripped jeans, sunglasses and all, and here he is as vibrant as he ever was. Johnny Ramone's three chord riffs on this album may be simple, but there's so catchy and irrestible that no one will complain. (Its a shame that his guitar gets pushed to the background on this remix)<br />Now on to the bonus tracks. The eight tracks are great, though not necessarily essential. The demos (with the exception of I Don't Care, which later appeared on Rocket to Russia) are pretty much the same as their original album counterparts, though I Don't Wanna Be Learned and You Should Never have Opened That Door are classics. However for those who already own the original album, this new edition may not be an essential buy.<br />I'd also like to note that not only did this album gave every punk band of the past 25 years its job (including its peers the Sex Pistols and the Clash, who both released great albums later that year) it also was a profound influence on New Wave Metal (which included the likes of Judas Priest and Motorhead), Speed/Thrash Metal (Metallica, Megadeath, Slayer), and grunge (Nirvana, Pearl Jam). So if you are a fan of any of the aformentioned band this is an important buy for you, so you can learn where they got their tricks.<br />In conclusion this is without a doubt one of the most important albums in the history of rock. From the first track (the great, great, GREAT, Blitzkrieg Bop) it grabs you and refuses to let you go, and by the end you are blown away by the terrific vibe that can come out of primitive lyrics and blindingly fast three chord assaults. You cannot call yourself a punk rock fan (or much of a rock and roll fan) until you have heard this several times. So don't wait. Get this TODAY!
0385484518|4.0|I read this book in conjunction with writing the autobiography of my life (thus far).  I found it provoked me into thinking at a deeper level about the paths I've chosen and the results of those (at times) rocky roads.  <br />For all the hype this book got when it came out, it deserves it.  Rich story-telling leads to an examination of your own life, what it leads to after that is up to you.<br />Buy it, read it, change.
B00005JKL8|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I walked out of this movie .  I enjoyed it immensely. My sentiments was share by my 11 year old nephew . It did not try to be something it was not.  It is a war movie and that is what it was filmed as.  <br />The movie itself was film quite well with it's use of special effects and scenery  with some of the beautiful landscape of the county used for plot line purposes. <br />I also enjoyed the fact that they did not try to put a romance in a war movie were it did not belong <br />All in all this was a great movie and will enjoy watching it over and over
B00005RY7X|5.0|For everyone who enjoys nay-saying Andrew W.K.'s debut release &quot;I Get Wet,&quot; my reply is simple: get it.  Andrew is not trying to do anything radical, new or lyrically challenging on &quot;Wet,&quot; he is simply trying to have a good time and maybe even puke while he is doing so.  While the music is FAR from a joke, it also not meant to be categorized with the angst-rock of Limp Bizkit, the Christian-rock undertones of P.O.D. or the the pop-punk sounds of Blink-182, all of which (unfortantly) dominate the airwaves on this side of the Atlantic.  The reason most critics and a handful of lucky, open-minded radio listeners are so into Andrew W.K. is becuase it's DIFFERENT.  It's not angst-ridden, it doesn't have Christian undertones, and it doesn't come off the Drive-Thru Records label (as most pop-punk albums over here in the US do).  Keep an open mind when listening to it, grab a drink, sit back, have fun, and Get Wet.
6305263299|5.0|Werner Herzogs Nosferatu is one of the most Erie and chilling remakes of Dracula this shows when Lucy is walking in the count's new residance , Adjani and Kinski work great together. The german version is better than the english, Roland Topar and Bruno Ganz give a good supporting cast but I was disapointed in Van Helsing though my rating 11/10
B00005QZWJ|1.0|While the musical score of Fellowship of the Ring is quite beautiful, the \\"Limited Edition\\" packaging is a shining example of how genre films brutally exploit their fans.<br />The music on the Limited Edition CD is identical to the less expensive version of the disk, and all the buyer gets for nearly twice the price is a [faux]-leather slipcase and picture booklet with lyrics to the vocals on the CD. There is nothing substantial in the Limited Edition packaging to warrant the greater expense. Nothing. For it's price and fancy packaging, it looks as though it should contain a second disk, but in doesn't. Don't be fooled.<br />To justify buying this edition, you have to consider a red leatherette package and lyric book worth an additional 10+ dollars. If you love the music (which is outstanding, and worthwhile), buy the less expensive version and have money left over for another CD.
B00005RIZP|5.0|I am an extreme horror collector.  I have been viewing, collecting, and building my 20 best horror films of all time.  Well, after finally locating this masterpiece after many years I have finally found my number one.  To all of you doubters, understand what this first and best slasher move has to offer...<br />1.  The all-time scariest maniac, \\"Billy\\" -- Just because he is so freaky and unpredictable.  He runs instead of walking, knocks stuff over, uses several weapons, talks to his prey, plays with his dead prey, tells his prey what he is going to do to them, has at least three personalities, goes into rages, and sings songs.  Top that Jason or Freddy.<br />2.  Now familiar settings that just seem fresh.  I know that its hard to believe that a frat house could ever be fresh, but it is in this movie.  Amazing!<br />3.  Comedy!  Yes, all great horror movies need to have at least a little comedy in them.  And B.C. has it fair share.  Not too much but enough for you to let your guard down.<br />4.  Intensity.  When the killer \\"Billy\\" stalks a victim, you feel like you are being chased also.  You can see kills coming but they still make you jump.   <br />5.  Last but not least - One killer eye scene that will make you scream like a little girl!<br />I just can't go on enough about this film.  It has everything.  You have to see this movie to understand how many other films have ripped it off.  It is so great that this masterpiece is finally getting some of the credit it deserves.  Buy it Now!!!
B00005LMBK|5.0|Gorrilaz are the best band in the WORLD!! 2D, Murdoc, Russel, and Noodle are the tightest! ... now I love Gorrilaz. Today I got the cd.(I'm only 10 so my mom was concerned about the PARENTIAL ADVISERY , which may I add Gorrilaz don't cuss often or talk about bad stuff, but now i've got it!!) Get this cd now. You won't regret it!!
B000031WD9|5.0|I found this film extremely funny.  Not a moment passes without a joke being cracked.  Also, not only is it funny but it also teaches valuable relationship lessons this is an absolute MUST-BUY CLASSIC
B000002KDO|4.0|Now 30 years old, this classic continues to shine.  Ozzy's voice comes howling out of the darkness to deliver some of the finest metal of all time.  My only complaint, for which I deducted a star in my rating, is the shortness of the disc, which is to be blamed on Warner Bros and not the band
B00005JKED|5.0|And thats saying alot becuase it got good reviews. Id like to start by saying if you liked this movie, see &quot;American History X&quot; which is also a very good movie. Denzel desrved the oscar I just didn't think he would get it becuase of the movies content. Buy this movie if your mature enough you wont regret it.
038542471X|3.0|The Client by John Grisham is most definitely the kind of book  you can't just stop reading, even if your tired. From the very first chapter, the plot is enticing to the point that you find yourself just having to read on to find out what will happen next.<br />The main character, 11 year old Mark, starts the story by trying to be a good guy. Ironically enough, his good intentions only lead him to trouble with both the authorities and the outlaws. And the more he runs from one side, the closer he comes to the other. Finally, as he twists and turns to escape from the situation all together, he finds himself forced to make the impossible choice between life on the run or life in prison. In addition to attention-grabbing, I also found the story to be funny in certain parts and still touching at others.<br />However, by the end of the story, I thought the actions and emotional stability of the boy became too unrealistic given he was supposed to be only 11 years old. I also felt that although the boy's dilemma was resolved, certain other important characters and their situations where not dealt with to full conclusion. I suppose Grisham could have wanted to leave room for speculation, but, more likely, I suspect he thought the implications he gave to the conclusions of these other affairs were sufficient. I think, though, the book would have been better had he followed through with every aspect of the plot and its characters. Hence, I rate the book at 3 stars despite the fact that in all honesty I couldn't put it down until I finished it.
B00005JKO3|5.0|this film is only good for people interested in history and historical figures presented \\"in a nutshell,\\" in that it presents the events which catapulted this spaniard into becoming an epic hero in the style of \\"chanson de roland\\" of france, \\"nibbenungelid\\" of germany and \\"beowolf\\" of england; thus \\"el cid\\" has been considered within the realm of world literature as the \\"spanish epic.\\" thus, if you are not interested in this subject matter, better not watch this.
0553274503|4.0|Not only was this a great story, it also addressed an issue that should be in the mind of ALL scientists at the cutting edge of research - just because we can, doesn't mean we should. <BR>Initially I thought that the pace of the story was a little fast, and wondered what the remainder of the book was going to be about. However, I shouldn't have been concerned, as Keyes steered it away from the initial direction to one which reminded me (somewhat abstractly) of Luke Rhinehart.<br />This is good, solid sci-fi which deserves it's place in this SF Masterworks series
B00005YW4H|5.0|Here's an idea: wherever people are fighting, air-drop a few thousand of these CDs. Guaranteed, within an hour or two, they'll all be mellowing out with some nice glasses of wine. This CD is the aural equivalent of an hour-long full body massage. No matter what your day's been like, no matter how frayed your nerves, pop Norah Jones in and everything's forgotten. And what a voice - a combination of Aretha Franklin, Carol King and Natalie Merchant. This is the real deal.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|How interesting that a movie such as Moulin Rouge could have such a deeply divided audience - you'll rarely hear anyone say they &quot;liked it,&quot; only that they loved it or hated it.<br />Assuming you're even looking at this product and/or its reviews insinuates that you're on the &quot;loved it&quot; camp, so I will skip the obligatory thematic review and skip right to the plusses of the format.<br />The DVD version of the film lives up to expectations, as this was quite a technically stunning film.  Lots of work went into all aspects of the movie, and the extras on the DVD showcase this extensive work quite nicely.  There are extended looks behind the costumes, the unique and refreshing music (who but Baz Luhrmann could turn &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; into a cabaret number?) and the myriad other technical intricacies of this fine film.<br />Interestingly enough, I felt the strongest performance in the film was that of Ewan McGregor, so it was a shame that he was left out of the Oscar nominations.  Nicole Kidman shines and Jim Broadbent, who also should have been nominated for his performance of Harold Zidler, often steals the screen.<br />Another great Ewan McGregor film to check out (for those who are interested) is Velvet Goldmine, a 70's era punk rock musical that also features his fine vocal abilities.. maybe someday he'll cut an album.<br />Until then, Moulin Rouge on DVD is one of the best packaged DVD's out there, and for the money, a 2-disc set is well worth the asking price.
B000002GFT|4.0|This album paved the way for dozens of bands and hundreds of albums, by introducing the combination of electric rock instruments and traditional British folk music.  Five of the eight pieces are traditional, and originals &quot;Farewell, Farewell&quot; and &quot;Crazy Man Michael&quot; match their timeless feel.  The addition of fiddler Dave Swarbrick as a full-time member gave Fairport someone to match musical leads with guitarist Richard Thompson.  The album is framed by two epic story-songs: &quot;Matty Groves&quot;, which became Fairport's signature tune, and &quot;Tam Lin&quot; (why does every Fairport live album contain the first, but none the latter?).  The &quot;Lark in the Morning&quot; medley and the close of &quot;Matty Groves&quot; mark the first appearances of Fairport's trademark electric jigs and reels.  The sound quality is a little muddy.  This isn't the Fairport album I'd take to a desert album, but it IS an album of historic import.
B00005RFVL|5.0|.<br />Filled with standards and lots of great duets, Swing When You're Winning is truly a great album. It's only fault is that it is NOT traditional, contemporary pop music, and it's hard to change people's tastes enough to embrace something new. He has a lot of talent behind him, however - Nicole Kidman (his duet with her was #1 in the UK over the holidays) and Jane Horrocks (Bubble from 'Absolutely Fabulous') and Jon Lovitz, to name the best.  Not to mention the duet on \\"Me & My Shadow\\" with his \\"roommate\\" Jonathan Wilkes.. hmm..<br />I'm grateful that Robbie Williams IS willing to experiment with different genres, and to break from the pop standards as he has so many times in the last 4-5 years, and Swing When You're Winning is a great result. Don't forget to check out his other great CD's, many of them available but completely underappreciated by American Audiences. Life Through a Lens, I've Been Expecting You, Sing When You're Winning (vs. Swing) are all great pieces of work and if you enjoy Robbie Williams, you'll love them, too.
B00005QDW1|1.0|Not a no doubt fan but their old stuff was waaaaay better.
B0000634EV|4.0|I used to play a bit with Jimmy (drums) in New Orleans, and am very familiar with Pepper and Kirk as well. This album does a great job of expaning on some of the themes laid out on their excellent debut album, &quot;NOLA&quot;. These are some fabulous musicians that distinguish themselves from the pack in their ability to find a swampy, thick groove and really lay it down. This album has more dynamic shifts and a wider array of instrumentation that the first release, but in my opinion equals or betters the finest work of each of their primary bands (Pantera, COC, Crowbar, &amp; Eyehategod). They seem to feel a greater sense of creative freedom here than in their own bands, and I for one would not mind seeing this become these guys' primary musical vehicle. Excellent album.
0783240287|1.0|One of the few musicals that I regret spending the money on because of the absymal recording quality.  The narrator was fairly easy to understand, but some sound track key singers were almost inaudible.<br /><br />The tunes would have been most enjoyable if the technical quality was acceptable.<br /><br />As one who enjoys musicals and muscial shows, I was very disappointed in the recording quality and video quality.
B00005JKED|4.0|first of all, CONGRATULATIONS to denzel washington for winning an oscar (finally).  i suppose he did not need the little statue to validate his acting. but, it is always nice to see dedicated actors get their just due.  training day is not unlike any of denzel washington's other movies, with him turning in a great performance.  except one thing:  he does not play the hero in this one.  from \\"glory\\" to \\"remember the titans\\", the audience has always rooted for him to triumph.  in this film he plays a corrupt officer who takes the law into his hands far too often. being that this is DENZEL playing a dirty cop, you still root for him to change his ways and somehow redeem himself by the end of the movie...
0393317552|5.0|Guns Germs and Steel is scholarship in a class by itself.  It is not only brilliant scholarship (and it is that -- even the speculation carries such a heavy weight of persuasion as to ring like authority); it is also an authoritative treatment of something of fundamental importance to understanding humankind.<br />But what is the great accomplishment of this ambitious book?  Merely to explain, from *first principles*, why it is that Europeans have come to dominate the rest of the world militarily and culturally.  And when I say first principles, I mean first principles:  the elements of his argument are the geophysical structure of our planet's continents, the distribution of flora and fauna across them, and the initial distribution of the first anatomically modern humans.<br />Briefly, Diamond shows that the roughly east-west orientation of the temperate latitudes of the Eurasian continent (as opposed to the roughly north-south orientation of the temperate zones of all other continents), combined with the wide variety of domesticable animals and crop-plants to be found there when humans first arrived (far exceeding the variety to be found anywhere else in the world) gave Eurasians a massive temporal \\"headstart\\" over humans elsewhere in terms of developing agriculture and in transporting innovations in agriculture to other contiguous areas with similar climactic conditions.  This led to the development of centers of dense population in Eurasia before such centers developed elsewhere -- in particular, the development of centers of dense population where humans lived in close association with non-human animals.  This led not only to rapid technological advancement but also to resistance to a wide variety of diseases.  This combination made Eurasians unbeatable.  Given the layout of the continents and the distribution of flora and fauna useful to humans across them, assuming humans wherever found were \\"equal\\" in intelligence, creativity, industriousness and strength, one would predict a priori that the Eurasians would become dominant.<br />Why European dominance over Asians?  Here, Diamond shifts mildly into the speculative.  He notes that Europe is more broken up by an indented coastline and by mountains than is Asia, and concludes that Europe's geography lent itself to many competing autonomous cultures, whereas Asia's lent itself to a single, broad, monolithic culture.  (Surely historical hindsight is polluting his argument with a little a posteriori reasoning here, but let us not quibble, the idea isn't ridiculous.) Technological innovation is more likely to take place, to flourish, and to spread, where there is local competition than where there isn't.  Not a perfect explanation, but surely a large component of a complete explanation all the same.  <br />It is possible to point to counter-evidence on a smaller scale, but at the broad level at which Diamond's argument is operative, it is unassailable.  <br />Like most modern revolutionary scholarship, Diamond's methodology is cross-disciplinary in nature; his own specialty is ornithology -- specifically, of all things, avian physiology.  This is not, however, as strange as it sounds, because in part it was his far-flung travels doing ornithology field-work that led him to put all of the pieces of his argument together.  In any event, Diamond draws upon history, archaeology, biology, genetics, and ethnology to produce his grand thesis to explain thirteen millennia of the human experience.  <br />In sum, I cannot recommend this book enough; it is destined to shape our collective understanding of human history at a profound level.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is a great movie based on a novel that's almost as good as Grimm Reality by Hale and Bucher-Jones, my all time favorite book. I like it as much as Neverending Story or the Baum Oz books. The director usually stinks. He even managed to mess up Bicentenial Man from Assimov. This time a miracle happened and the movie is good.
B00005RY7X|4.0|This is one of the few cd's that, after listening to it once, sticks with you and feels good. Granted, that may be a direct result of some 80's rock influences, but who cares? Throw it in for a party or road trip, and those who are not familiar with Andrew will soak in the wetness as much as any fan. Screaming guitar, solid vocals, and a few innovative &quot;extras&quot; will please the hard rock junkie in you.
0780624890|4.0|Stephen Norrington's \\"Blade\\" is a slam-bang wallow in wondrous excess, possessing action sequences that set a new standard for the genre while being careful to incorporate them into a story, rather than reversing the formula. The plot itself contains new and used material, ranging from the familiar (various lines of dialogue, predictable revelations) to the as yet unexplored (some new twists on old vampire knowledge); in the end, it amounts to one of the best vampire films of recent years. <br />Derived from the Marvel Comics characters, the story pits one man against endless immortals, vampires who indulge in techno clubs, raising hell, and, of course, a relentless bloodlust. But rather than pin these grueling antagonists down by the old tricks of the vampire trade, these creatures have adapted themselves to new ways of living, such using sun block for protection when venturing into the daylight. <br />Heading an army of one whose mission is fixed on vampire annihilation is Blade (Wesley Snipes), a \\"daywalker\\" whose bark and bite go hand-in-hand. A typical bad... character played to perfection by Snipes, Blade is the embodiment of hardcore, his vast array of weapons and deep voice slicing through legions of undead souls that just keep coming back for more. Born of a mother who suffered a vampire bite minutes before his birth, Blade benefits from superior strength and the ability to walk among humankind, but suffers from a thirst for blood, suppressed by a serum his body has begun to reject. <br />Meanwhile, plans are developing in the mind of revered immortal Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), whose ambitious fantasies about the resurrection of \\"La Magra,\\" or the Blood God, pose a threat to the pure-bloods who hold control over the underground society. This is where the story begins to venture into territory that is original in its ideas but familiar in its execution, replete with special effects that range from convincing to downright cheesy, and situations where the outcome is easily what you guess it to be. <br />But who really cares? In fact, who could ask for more? In the face of its minor flaws, \\"Blade\\" is top-notch filmmaking, given an incredible amount of intensity and hardcore action that, like its characters, goes right for the jugular. Yes, one will find themselves in the midst of scenes where characters explain things to one another with the use of dialogue that is campy and familiar, and yes, there is an abundance of blood and gore, more Wes Craven than Bram Stoker. However, it never stops moving, not even for its flaws, giving one little time to consider their heft in regards to the film as a whole. <br />Director Stephen Norrington makes great use of his cast, particularly Snipes, who throws himself into the role with all the brazen, bold attitude one could hope for; he makes what would essentially seem old (i.e. the dialogue, various play-on-words) feel fresh and new. Kris Kristofferson and N'Bushe Wright play his partners in battle; there's not much to their characters, but they get the job done. Dorff exudes a cocky presence onscreen befitting of Deacon Frost, making him a viable adversary. <br />In the end, the real stars of \\"Blade\\" are its stunning array of visually jolting action sequences, that which revive the genre from its moribund status. Filled with shot upon shot of machine gun-fire, bass-heavy explosions and even the roar of a subway in one of the most intense sequences, this is one hell of an action film that just might leave you thirsty for a sequel.
B00005T30L|2.0|It is slow, boring, and without a plot. Yes, it does look like several different episodes of a comic book were put together to make this movie. It stinks!
B00005V1Y0|4.0|There's more than love in the air in \\"Strictly Ballroom,\\" Australian director Baz Luhrmann's energetic and exciting tale of love among the dance steps that does everything but jump off the screen. The film is essentially a fashion show put to a beat, but it proves itself as more than just a glorious wallow in stylish excess with its love-conquers-all story and themes that, despite their familiarity, feel as good as new. <br />It's a simple tale of whimsy, focusing on young dancer Scott Hastings (Paul Mercurio), whose looks and talent have secured him a future as the world's most revered dancer. We see in the film's beginning, through a fanciful documentary-like series of interviews and dance events, that Scott dabbles in his own style, creating his own crowd-pleasing moves in spite of the disapproval of his mother and highly regarded judges, who consider his technique a threat to their \\"strictly ballroom\\" approach. <br />Everyone that surrounds him pleads with him to give up his boyish dreams; his teacher, Les Kendall (Peter Whitford), feels his apprentice has unrealized potential that would be squandered were he to continue his imaginative steps, while his mother, Shirley (Pat Thompson), wants to steer her son from the same mistakes she made years ago. Scott's father, Doug (Barry Otto), secretly harvests a similar passion for originality, that which will come into play as the movie progresses. <br />Despite this barrage of protestations, Scott knows better, and holds true to his own heart, continuing his private dancing in his teacher's studio when no one is looking. He is approached by Fran (Tara Morice), a simple girl with a plain demeanor and an equal longing to dance as she pleases. Scott, at first hesitant at her proposal that they dance together in preparation for a grand contest, agrees to teach her; as you may well know, they develop a deeper bond than love of dancing. <br />Sound familiar? Well, it is, actually. The plot reminded me numerous times of various films, such as \\"Dirty Dancing,\\" with its various characters denouncing Scott's dancing, and a pastiche of various fairy tale romances, as the two young lovers encounter obstacles in the way of their happiness. But, when filtered through Luhrmann's wondrous ability to make the old seem new and exquisite, such familiar plot characteristics are given new life, and possess the ability to move us, and excite us. <br />And speaking of exciting, when was the last time such energy and humor as this was seen? Luhrmann has quite the visionary eye, and puts it to incredible use, assaulting us with a visceral array of tightly-choreographed dance sequences, vibrant costumes, and a sense of humor and wit that stays with the film through its entire. Accompanying these attributes are young actors Mercurio and Morice, who sell us on the love story so well that its hard not to feel a sense of urgency when things look stormy for the two. <br />At various points in \\"Strictly Ballroom,\\" the audience is given two options: surrender to the film's pseudo-realistic central message (\\"A life lived in fear is a life half lived\\"), or flee. Luhrmann throws so much of this into the mix of song, dance, love and ribaldry, that some may find it distracting, but make no mistake: such elements span the gamut of past and present, achieving a universal feel that almost anyone can relate to. This is a truly remarkable film, a special piece of fancy that captures the heart and incites it to soar.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I'm still in total shock on why India.Arie did not win any Grammys. I guess the Grammy voters were too busy oohing and aahing, drooling, and getting all goggly-eyed over Alicia Keys to even pay attention to India.Arie, which is a real shame, because it is India.Arie who has all the talent--and she doesn't need a manager like Clive Davis to get the media to overhype her. Instead of playing the piano like Alicia, India plays the acoustic guitar plus, she can also play the drums. All of the songs on ACOUSTIC SOUL are truly amazing and beautiful! It is a breathtaking album and I'm sure India.Arie will be around for a lot longer than Alicia Keys is. \\"Video\\" is definitely the best track off this album, but all the others are wonderful, too. Some of my other personal favorites include \\"Promises\\", \\"Ready For Love\\", \\"Beautiful\\", and \\"Nature\\". ACOUSTIC SOUL is a true original album, and the lyrics do not repeat each other like on SONGS IN A MINOR. India.Arie has a beautiful, soulful voice that soars way over Alicia's head, and is just simply breathtaking like everything else about India.Arie. ACOUSTIC SOUL was definitely one of the best albums of 2001 that was overlooked by the Grammy voters. I listened to both SONGS IN A MINOR and ACOUSTIC SOUL and I just find India.Arie's album to be better than SONGS IN A MINOR and I find India.Arie to be more talented than Alicia Keys. Alicia Keys is too manufactured and too MTV-like to ever be known as a true soul/R&B artist. India.Arie is not manufactured at all and she is not played on MTV often so she is a true soul/R&B artist. I cannot wait for India.Arie's next album and I hope it's as good as this one, if not then better. Grab ACOUSTIC SOUL off the CD shelf at the music store and play it in your CD player because it's a must-own for all music lovers!
B00005JKED|5.0|Denzell's performance was the bomb, he portrayed a crooked cop and he did it with style as only Denzell could capture the ruff neck hoodster style cop in L.A. Although it took some time getting use to him playing the bad guy and getting killed in the end made me cry because he was the star and my favorite actor and now the Oscar's Best Actor for starring in Training Day. Way to go Denzell this is a most have DVD to add to your Denzell collection.
B00000BKE0|5.0|it is usually difficult to write reviews for CD's, but seeing that this one got such a low score, I felt I had to help kick it up some... A great CD, the kind of music they just don't make anymore.  pity.  if you like real metal, pick it up- it should be in every fan's collection.
B000002NE4|3.0|I was introduced to the music of Nick Cave a little over a year ago but have only begun to really appreciate him over the last four months.<BR>Murder Ballads made me a solid fan, and I have since heard and enjoyed most of his other work. The Boatman's Call will come as a surprise to fans who expect the sneering, snarling Nick Cave we know best. Here is a very different side of Nick Cave. Compared to albums past, it is almost uniformly somber and sullen. That's not to say it doesn't have its good points.<BR>Cave's piano, as always, is excellent as are his lyrics. My favorites are Into My Arms, Where Do We Go Now But Nowhere?, West Country Girl, and Idiot Prayer. The only song I really dislike is the half-spoken Green Eyes which closes out the album.<BR>If you are one, like me, who prefers the reckless energy of Henry's Dream or Let Love In, you may find that this is too subdued. But if you are one who likes the introspective style of No More Shall We Part, then you should find The Boatman's Call to be much to your liking.
B00005V9HH|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time not too long ago, and I must say, this is one of the best movies I've seen with Kevin Spacey in it in a long time.  The plot is riveting, camera angles exciting, and the action very intense.  If you're looking for a genre name for this movie, I'd say its somewhere in between action thriller and suspenseful mystery.  The movie will keep you going to the end and boy what an ending it turns out to be.  If you enjoyed the ending to Seven, and want another great movie ending to follow suit, rent or buy The Usual Suspects today.  Also, I reccommend this to anyone that likes movies that read like books.  The movie doesn't give you any real clues as to who the characters are, or what they are trying to do, untill the opportunity presents itself.  The ending will make you realize what has just happened in the last two hours that you have been sitting in front of the t.v.  A great all around movie.  Pay attention while watching it or you might be more confused at the end than you were for the beginning.  Check out other movies with Spacey in them as well.  Some of my favorites are American Beauty, Seven ( where Kevin makes more of a cameo than anything else), and the Big Kahuna.  also, don't forget about Spacey's newest, K-Pax.  a great movie with another great ending.  Enjoy the usual suspects, and then be sure to figure out who in the world this Keyser Soze person is that everyone mentions in their reviews.
B000002ADT|5.0|I don't profess to be a Miles Davis expert and own only a half dozen of his many recordings. I have tried for years to get into his music but my interest has remained lukewarm at best until I found this CD in a used bin at my favorite record store.<BR>Kind of Blue shows another side to the Miles Davis I knew. This CD swings and flows effortlessly from one groove to the next. I particularly enjoy Freddie Freeloader. It's sophisticated mellowness makes it perfect for playing in the office or at home when kicking back after a long hard day.<BR>I can't say its the best Miles Davis CD, I haven't heard ten percent of his work. But I can say this is essential Miles, because its the one I'll throw on when someone asks to hear him.
0446678430|5.0|I find Mr. Kiyosaki's books extremely inspirational. In each of his books, you will find a wealth of radical ideas that will, if you have an open mind, change your vision of everything society has made us believe in terms of wealth building and the general sense of dependency towards earned income (e.g. job income) to make a living.<br />Yes, you will not find specifics, but consider this book as a menu of alternatives to find portfolio and passive income alternatives that you might wish to explore more deeply.  In my own case is option trading.  As of today, I have read over 10 books (and growing) in option trading and I can tell you that any person that consider it a risky investment, does not know what s/he is talking about.<br />The only area of the book which I find boring is the story of his both dads.  I specially find it very denigrating for Robert's biological dad (poor dad) to keep repeating these stories all over again.  Robert, keep up your excellent mission in life which is, among other things, to teach the common person to get rich. But please, let your poor dad rest in peace.<br />Aside from this, this book is worth its weight in gold.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|With teen movies overflowing the movie industry it is nice to finally get an original movie.  Although slow at times that is of set by its originality.  The best thing about this movie is that if you can guess the ending you are the worlds greatest detective.  Its a movie that glues you to your set in suspense, if you think you know what is about to happen your probably wrong.  If you are tired of Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jason Biggs than watch this movie it is like nothing else.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I, for some reason, enjoyed this film more than I should of.  I mean, the film is masterfully directed.  It's one of the best of the year.  And the fact that Baz Luhrman wasn't nominated was a damn shame.  It's okay, though.  It got a Best Picture nomination.  Even though it didn't win, it still picked up Art Direction and Costume Design.<br />The film would be too complicated to explain all together here, so I'll do my best.  A young man sets out to Paris to become a writer about love.  But he's never been in love, which proposes a problem.  But when he meets a group of playwrites/producers under humorous circumstances, he learns they are putting on a play.  About what at first, we're not exactly sure.  But they don't have funding for the play, so they head down to the infamous Moulin Rouge where they plan to put the play on and from then on out, you'll just have to figure out for yourself.<br />As for the film itself, it's amazing.  The first twenty minutes of the film is frantic, to say the least.  At first, it appears as though they're just trying to introduce as many characters as possible in the beginning of the film, while splicing such pop culture staples together, such as songs from Nirvana and Marilyn Monroe.  And of course the popular remake of the song Lady Marmalade.  And yes, I said Nirvana.  I really don't want to tell you too much more about the film.  Discover it for yourself.<br />The video transfer on this disc is amazing.  There is some EXTREMELY slight edge enhancement, but you'd have to be really looking for it to notice it.  Then why did I?  Well, I watched this disc four times, which I'll get into in a bit.  As I said before, the film won the Oscars of its art direction and costumes, and rightfully so.  All the colors come to life with vibrance.  It's the next best thing to actually being there.  Watch this disc on the biggest TV you can find and you'll see the light.<br />Now, when I said that I watched the movie itself four times, once wasfor the movie itself, the second time was for the picture quality, the third time was to analyze the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, and the fourth time was to analyze the DTS 5.1 mix.  Much like the video transfer, the audio is basically flawless.  On the Dolby Digital, it was hard to hear some of the lyrics, but nothing incredibly distracting.  The DTS is better, as expected and there were actually some good moments where the subwoofer gets some action that wasn't during a musical number.<br />And as for the extras, I don't know where to being.  Talent profiles, documentaries, outtakes, music videos, and just about everything else you could think of.  It'll take a while to get through all of them.  I know because it took me around six hours to watch every extra.<br />All in all, Moulin Rouge is the best DVD of the year in every aspect and definitely worth owning.
B000001GQY|5.0|It is not without reason that Gramophone, looking back over the recordings of the 20th Century, said that Emil Gilels' colaboration with Eugene Jochum on the Brahms Piano Concertos ranked as one of the 100 best. Once you listen to these CDs, you will realize that this high praise is more than deserved. Twenty-five years after they were released on LP, DG's 1996 release on CD captures all of the power of the performances and then some. Gilels' pacing, his fingering and pedaling ... all match perfectly to the pieces. These are truly historic recordings, ones that set the bar for other pianists -- and conductors -- that few can ever come close. Very highly recommended.
B00005TT77|3.0|It's a good bet that by now, you've heard the very popular, and still growing, hit song sung by Eddie Vedder &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;.  And it's also a good bet that you knew it was a Beatles cover.  Whether you like that song or hate it, you have to admit one thing: it's pretty catchy.<br />Unfortunately for the rest of the songs on the soundtrack-- with the exception of the surprisingly good Stereophonics--, the rest of them aren't so lucky.  They put their hearts into it, but unfortunately, their hearts were thrown right back at them.  I mean, sure, you'll get a nice collection of some of today's better artists from the alternative folk rock scene, including the Wallflowers and the Black Crowes.  Now, of course it's expected that they try their best on this compelation.  But it seems that no matter how hard they try, it always seems like the songs come out sounding like those old karaoke tapes your parents used to have.<br />But for some reason, that's a good thing.  Especially towards the end of the album, you'll discover that the worse the music gets, the more entertaining it gets.  Sure, I'd rather listen to Courtney Love farting on Dave Grohl's snare drum then the &quot;Let It Be&quot; cover (by an artist that shall remain nameless) that finishes it off, but it's one of those things that fall into the, &quot;It's so bad, it's good,&quot; category.  If you can tolerate more than forty minutes of unintentional hilarity that will, at times, leave you scratching your head, then you'll enjoy it.<br />The songs are for the film &quot;I Am Sam&quot; and as far as I can tell, most of them don't fit in with the film, which really deteriorates the quality of the music.  I thought the key phrase in the term &quot;motion picture soundtrack&quot; was &quot;motion picture&quot;.  But it seems that as with past soundtracks (&quot;Big Momma's House&quot; for example), this one just turns out to be an album that has the film's theme song and a bunch of songs that weren't even it or even worse, have nothing to do with the movie on it.<br />&quot;I Am Sam&quot; is one of those albums where you have to be in the mood to listen to it.  It's a lot funnier than a lot of comedy albums out there, and it's not even supposed to be.  If you know this going in, then this is highly enjoyable.  If you're a Beatlemaniac (which I am fortunately not due to this album), you'll be even more outraged at this then when Michael Jackson bought the rights to their songs (&quot;Revolution&quot; in a Nike commericial, how stupid).  But if you're not hardcore about it, then you'll have no problem sitting through this at all.
0790742780|5.0|Most critics (who as we know, are mostly bitter, failed filmakers) nitpick so much at this film that they miss the powerful statement it makes.<br />This film takes all of our frustrations at modern life and pushes them to a conclusion that we have seen in real life.<br />D-Fens snaps, plain and simple.  As so often happens with people pushed too far. More acts of violence in this country are commited by average people rahter than sinister career criminals.<br />How many times have we heard the news reports; Man goes insane, kills his family and then himself.  Then they interview neighbors who say; \\"He was such a quiet man, helped me bring in my groceries every week\\"<br />D-Fens is every one of us.  Haven't you ever wished that you had a gun in hand so you could blow the fool head off the moron who just cut you off?  The pressure in the big cities is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with.<br />Los Angeles along has over 12 million people in it.  How long can we be treated like animals, and be expected to act like civilized people?<br />I do not see this movie as having any heroes in it.  Only victims.  This movie is certainly entertaining, and provactive.  But more than anything else, it is a warning.  A warning that if we do not change out basic attitudes, civilization will all go the way of poor D-Fens.<br />People laugh when I say that I believe civilization will collapse, they think no such thing can happen.  But where are the great empires of the past?  Where is Rome?  Where are the Pharohs?  Even the USSR came apart.  Is it really so hard to believe that the same can happen here?<br />We need to start caring a little more than we do, we need to start being a little nicer, and a lot less selfish.  We have to lose this sense of entitlement we have.  We need to take pride in ourselves and in our country once again, if we do not all want to turn in to D-Fens.
0345448898|5.0|... About a month ago, desperate for something I could loose myself in, I picked up \\"The Golden Compass.\\"  It was in the \\"young - mature\\" or some-such section of the bookstore, and I was put off until I read the frontpiece.  It seems to me any book that begins with a (truly frightening) quote from \\"Paradise Lost\\" deserves a much broader placement than \\"young - mature.\\"  <br />I raced through the trilogy, glad the only wait I had to experience between volumes was the time it took to catch my breath.<br />\\"His Dark Materials,\\" is a deep climb into myth and archetype that is the hero's journey, a critique of organized religion, a travelogue of alternate worlds, and a breathtaking adventure.  Philip Pullman has pulled together a cast of characters that seems to touch on the entire diversity of Western mythology, including the wild-western; as well as every dark bedroom fear of childhood.  The trilogy is grounded in the coming-of-age story of his protagonists (Lyra and Will), and flies into fantasy with the telling of a new age in the universe.  <br />As a writer Mr. Pullman works a dynamic that races with gore and violence, gentles in natural idyll, provokes with psychology, philosophy, theology, and what some would call \\"heresy,\\" and compels with deft plotting, and well crafted characters.<br />I'm glad I read this series as an adult, wish I had read it as a 12 year old, would recommend it to the mature young reader with no hesitation, and to the older reader who has not lost his or her sense of wonder.
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams does it again! This cd has mystery, suspense, intruige, magic, and all other things that perfectly describe the books. The Harry Potter soundtrack is my favorite J. Williams soundtrack since Jurrasic Park. Just like the books, this cd takes you into another world, where anything is possible. From the cheerful melodies of \\"Diagon Alley\\" to the forceful tunes of \\"Devil's Snare\\", this cd is a must have! Even if you usually listen to pop, rock, or anything else, just listen to a sample and you'll see what I mean! My favorite songs are \\"Harry's Wonderous World\\" and \\"Hedwig's Theme\\". When you listen to \\"Quidditch Match\\" you can perfectly picture the out of control broom, Harry spitting out the snitch, and the crowd exploding with applause as Harry flies over the stands, his hand raised in victory. \\"Christmas at Hogwarts\\" is also a very capturing and interesting tune. I won't tell you why, in case you haven heard it already.<BR>Even if you haven't seen the movie or read the books, listening to this cd will make you want to run to the theatre to see it or to your bookshelf to read it. All in all, this is one the best soundtracks I've ever heard. Way to go, John Williams!
6303187064|4.0|I have always had an unearthly fascinaion for the \\"bad boys\\" and Brandon Lee as \\"The Crow\\" definitely fits the bill in this movie. The graphic death scenes only make you wish someone like him could come back and seek justice. The soundtrack is so edgy and the movie itself reminds you of a \\"Batman\\" movie except it is less \\"funny\\" and more intense. I will miss Brandon and always wonder what he may have truly become in life besides a legend like his father.
B00005NW02|5.0|I can't even put into words how much I love this album. I got it the first day it came out, in eager anticipation...and i was amazed at how good it was. It is one of the few cds I can listen to all the way through...and by getting the bonus cd-rom, you get an even further in-depth look at the musical talents of System of a Down. Just...buy the album. It's astounding.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I can't tell yet whether Ryan Adams is the Second Coming or just a talented huckster.  With \\"Heartbreaker\\", he got the song stylings of his musical influences down to a T -- from Steve Earle to Bob Dylan to Gram Parsons.  The album just screamed, \\"Here I Am -- Ready To Assume The Next Great Singer-Songwriter Throne\\".<br />With \\"Gold\\", it's clear he understood the need to break out and create his own sound.  But was it a personal decision or a calculated one?  Too soon to tell.<br />...<br />The songs on \\"Gold\\" are so much better than \\"Heartbreaker\\", but the production is WAY too slick.  You get the feeling that chestnuts such as \\"The Rescue Blues\\" might have been among the next set of American classics if Adams, producer Ethan Johns or someone else (Duritz?) didn't feel the need to put a soaring chorale or some other cheeseball effect over Adams' plaintive, nicotine-stained vocals and gentle guitar.<br />With all my complaining, I still give \\"Gold\\" four stars and not three, because more than half of the songs are so incredible.  Lots of potential here.  But the jury's still out.  I guess I'll keep buying Ryan Adams albums, which I suspect is the only thing he wants to hear.
B00005V0X5|4.0|I was told to avoid buying this album for quite a while because of the poor sound quality.  Logically, I had nothing to lose, being a rather new and yet hard-core Megadeth fan, when this album finally got a remaster.<br />For the most part, I would rather be listening to any other Megadeth album than this.  I do like the stuff on here though.  To really get what is on this disc, one has to read the booklet that came with it.  Each of the original seven songs has comments from either Mustaine or Ellefson or both, and there is an explanation as to why the version of These Boots on this CD is the way it is.  I find it hilarious that it's even on here like that, especially after reading the booklet!!  Also, go to Megadeth's website to find the uncensored version of These Boots that would have gone on this disc.  You really think Mustaine and the gang would leave his fans hanging like that?  ;)<br />The demos are exactly that:  very low quality versions of finished products, but I like hearing that sort of thing sometimes.<br />Well done!!
B000002MG1|5.0|This CD is a Very Hard Act to Follow. Just Wonderful.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I have been a great admirer of the work carried out with the complete series of The Godfather.   I am not a professional just a movie fan, but you can appreciate all the visual richness that a great movie can give us with the complete three episodes of this film.<br />From sweet to bitter, from young to old, from poor to rich, from a simple movie to one of the best films ever shot.  Maybe I cannot express the appropiate words in English, but in any language this movie is a masterpiece.<br />Angelica Gutierrez
B00004Z459|5.0|I have to admit, I did not like Linkin Park from when I first heard \\"Crawling\\". I saw a Target commercial for this CD, playing Crawling and thought, My god, who listens to this stuff?? But then I heard \\"In the End\\" and I had to check them out. I am so glad I did!! Linkin Park is my new fave band. They really got me into rock music. Sometimes the songs are really soft (My December) or sometimes they're really loud and hard (Papercut). I like their soft songs though. I also love being able to bob to a song! This CD is worth every penney I paid for it! Mike's voice mixed with Chester's voice is like, perfect. You can tell by the way they sing it that they are so into what they do. This is the best CD I own. BUY IT!!<br />1. Papercut- 10/10: this song just blasts out. its really loud. It got me hooked right away. I love this song. I especially like the \\"sun goes down\\" part. <br />2. One Step Closer- 9/10: would you believe, I heard this song on the radio, liked it, but never knew who it was until I bought this CD?? anyway, this song is great! whenever I'm getting \\"lectured\\" I can't help but think of this song. SHUT UP WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU!!!<br />3. With You- 8.5/10: I love the intro to this song, and the sound effects. I don't know, sometimes Chester's screaming voice gets on my nerves sometimes....<br />4. Points of Authority- 9.5/10: this song is awsome. I really like the beat. I don't know how to describe it, but this song really gets me into it.<br />5. Crawling- 9/10: Do I really have to say anything? I would probably like this song a lot more if it wasn't so overplayed. But I still love the verses, the way Chester sings it. <br />6. Runaway- 9.5/10: I love the intro to this song, and the pre-chorus. It's pretty hard (he starts screaming at the end) but I like it all the same.<br />7. By Myself- 10/10: (you guys are gonna think this sounds stupid but..) the rapping in this song is really pretty. I like the way Chester says \\"failure\\". I like the way this song flows, its really hard. <br />8. In the End- 10/10: I'm sure you have all heard this song, but still.... This is one of my favorites. I love the video. I like the whole song, but especially the \\"put my trust in you\\" part. (Chester looks cute in the video!!)<br />9. A Place for My Head- 9.5/10: Whoa! I don't know what to say about this song, except that me and my sister know all the words!! We love this song (sing along all the time)! {You try to take the best of me, GO AWAY!!}<br />10. Forgotten- 10/10: I love how this song skips the intro, and goes straight to the heavy stuff! Pretty hard. I can't think of anything bad about this song.<br />11. Cure for the Itch- 8.5/10: This song is okay, it's just DJ scratching, which you've probabaly heard by now. {Hey all, it's their site music..}<br />12. Pushing Me Away- 9.5/10: this song is really hard in the beginning but gets alot softer. I like it though. it's a really good last song. I love it. <br />Hope this helps! One bad thing about the album: Not Long Enough!!<br />ps. I just heard (and burned) My December and High Voltage. they are both really good songs. I like My December because it's really soft and I can sing along to it :).  High voltage is really cool. It sounds hip hop, which i don't really like, but I do like this song.<BR>pps. The song \\"It's Going Down\\" with the X-Ecutioners was awesome! I love that song.
630289915X|1.0|No wonder people cry at the end of this ridiculous stinker -- they're so grateful it's over!  Jimmy Stewart, who was a returning war hero when he made this thing, is, as a result, totally miscast as a naive small-towner who never goes anywhere.  Donna Reed is gorgeous but she was wasted making films in an era when she couldn't show off her body.  Clarence the Angel is OK for the Teletubby crowd, but a movie intended for grownups as well?  Yikes.  All Lionel Barrymore's bad guy needs is a mustache to twirl and he'd be the perfect cartoon villain.  The ending is a cheat -- not only would the whole table-full-of-money thing never happen in real life, but what about all the poor saps watching the movie who have to think, &quot;Well, maybe George Bailey could believe his life is worth living, but he's a movie character, and the script is built that way -- what about me?&quot;  I can see this movie being responsible for more suicides than anything excluding Ingmar Bergman.  Oh, and that line -- &quot;She's an old maid -- she's just about to close the library&quot; made me spit out my drink the first time I heard it.  Give me A Christmas Story any day.
B00005NWM3|4.0|...I bought this CD because of all the mixed reviews I heard about it. It's actually not that bad. I mean, it's not my favorite CD or anything, but it's definately not my worst CD. <br />1. Never Again- 9.5/10:  This song is really catchy. I was singin it for a long time after I heard it. It really grabs your attention. Good choice for a first song.<br />2. How You Remind Me- 9/10:  If you haven't heard this song, crawl out from underneath your rock. I would like it more, except that it's so overplayed. <br />3. Woke Up This Morning- 9.5/10:  I like the intro and the \\"all of this\\" part. This is a really good song. I like it a lot actually.<br />4. Too Bad- 9/10:  Again, overplayed. But, I still like it. Kinda slow when it starts out, but it picks up in the chorus.<br />5. Just For- 8/10:  First time I heard it, I didn't like this song, but found myself humming it later. It's that catchy. I like the guitars. <br />6. Hollywood- 8/10:  Nothing special. It's okay. Not my favorite. <br />7. Money Bought- 10/10:  This is definately one of my favorite songs on the album. I love it! Great song.<br />8. Where Do I Hide- 10/10:  Another one of my faves. Love the intro. I hum this song all the time.<br />9. Hangnail- 9.5/10:  I really like the guitar at the beginning. It's pretty good. I can picture it on the radio.... I like the \\"just grab your ..., leave with it\\"!<br />10. Good Times Gone- 6/10:  I don't like this song. It's weird, that slidy thing at the beginning is creepy. It almost sounds country, God forbid...<br />So! That's it. All in all, if I were you I would consider buying it. It's not a total waste of money, but if you're not sure definately burn someones.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This CD is really good. I like almost every song on this CD! That is very unusual cuz I usually dont like every song. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE!! THE SONGS RULE!! I LOVE ROCK AND ROLL...HEHE
0060977264|3.0|I read the Alchemist and I really liked it, so I figured this book would be another moving experience. I was disappointed a third of the way in, and remained that way for the rest of the book. I never once felt attached to either of the characters. The love that unfolds in the story seems a bit empty. These people are apparently connected through a lovely childhood, but *why* is their bond so special? The book says little more than &quot;they had a lovely childhood together&quot; and we're expected to just take the author's word for it. It's the same with her transformation in the days she spends with him. Her life is changed by his influence, but why? Did it really only take a change of scenery? Has she really never thought of some of the things he's discovered? Could she have just fallen in love with anyone who brought her out of her banal existence? I felt like as these events were happening, I wasn't being brought along for the ride. I was merely taking the author's word for it and reading a summarization. Their love meant nothing to me because I couldn't see why she wanted him over anyone else, and vice versa. Without real purpose and depth, love stories like this become fluff. I think with twice the content and detail, I would have felt much more of a connection to the material. I like a lot of the things Coelho has to say (it's still a better story than I could write) and I'm definitely going to read the rest of his books -- this one just wasn't for me.
B00005RFAI|4.0|i like the pink CD a lot, but not all the songs are great. My favorite song is the popular \\"Dont let me get me\\" Others I like are M!ssundaztood, Just like a pill, get the party started, respect, 18 wheeler, family potrait (sad), lonely girl, and my vietnam. So I like 9 out of 14, which is pretty good. I would recommend people to buy this CD, but just dont expect to like every single song.
0446389234|5.0|this, along with \\"the dark knight returns\\" and \\"the killing joke\\", is not only one of the best batman stories ever written, but is probably right up there with some of the greatest art and literature ever produced in terms of profundity and reflection on the human condition and the problem of evil. bruce wayne, a tormented and obsessed man, struggles to find a way to put 'sense' back into his life after an unimaginably traumatizing event in his childhood--the gunning down of his parents by a two-bit mugger, with young bruce as the only witness. this horrendous crime and the dark shadow of absurdity and senselessness it casts over his existence forces him to become an avenger of sorts, a vigilante who, while knowing his task to be impossible, has no basic choice but to become a one man war on crime, using his inheritance and his willpower to become batman. this is a beautiful, haunting read and no batman devotee will ever forget it.
0345448898|4.0|Anyone who enjoys well written fantasy will be pulled into these books by the dazzling invention and tight plotting. You'll stay up late turning pages to find out what happens next. But the first protaganist is unlikable, the characterization in general is weak, and in the third book it dawned on me why: Pullman is more concerned with his polemic against what he perceives the beliefs of the Christian church to be, than with his characters or his story. The two male \\"angels\\" who are desperately in love with each other are such a self-conscious anti-stereotype that I realized the author was more concerned with scoring points against his understanding of Christian belief than with story-telling. That's fine--I'm a committed Christian, yet I don't mind being asked to think. But it's the difference between this trilogy and The Lord of the Rings (grand in a way this cannot be), or the Harry Potter books (less inventive but more charming), which are vastly different from each other, and from His Dark Materials. Story comes first in those books, despite obvious parallels to the \\"real\\" world. Pullman has written an allegory, which Tolkien and Rowling did not. It's still a great read--don't worry about the fact that you don't care about the characters, and enjoy Pullman's imagination. Not for children, though! It has moments of real horror.
B00005JKED|5.0|I rented this movie only days before the Academy Awards.  I had no idea that Denzel Washington was nominated for best actor for his role in this movie (I swear!  Yeah, I must live in a hole or something, but I really didn't know...).  I was absolutely blown away by his performance; it's exceptional.  Without revealing too much, there is one scene in particular toward the end of the movie, where Washington's character is in trouble and is being confronted by both his enemies and his \\"brothers\\", that goes way beyond mere acting.  The whole movie overall probably deserves 4 stars, but I gave it 5 based on the acting.  Enjoy!
B000002UVZ|5.0|I love this album and it is the R.E.M. album I listen to most frequently. It has great songs which basically carry the same theme of standing up for yourself and not letting yourself be pushed around. &quot;Begin the Begin,&quot; &quot;These Days,&quot; &quot;Superman,&quot; and &quot;Cuyahoga&quot; are great examples. This is a great album from start to finish.<br />This is the first album in R.E.M.'s personal and political activism phase. The phase ended with Green. This phase in my opinion was R.E.M.'s golden years. The albums that came before &quot;Life's Rich Pagent&quot; and after &quot;Green&quot; are great and some of the best albums of all time but the album from the personal and political activism phase are the best.<br />This is a great album and I give my highest approval. Five Stars! Do something with your life!
B00005MAM2|5.0|If you've never seen any anime before, and you're wondering where to start, start right here.  You need this film, ESPECIALLY ON DVD.  It is one of the most important anime ever created, if not only for the advancements in animation, then for the advancements in storytelling through the animated format and sheer, graphic realism.  That's one of the major differences between live action and animation...you can do things with animation that you can't do with real actors.  You also don't have to worry about safety issues and property damage.  <br />And by the way...this film is not intended for small children.  If you want to watch it WITH them and (try to) explain things, feel free.
B00005NWM3|3.0|This album isn't the best, the lyrics are okay and the music is lukewarm. This album is a big step forward from \\"The State\\" and you can tell just by listening to the first track. I enjoy this album and listen to it a lot. It does not deserve any critical acclaim or awards of any sort. \\"Silver Side Up\\" is just traditional millenium rock music that is fun to listen to. Nickelback is great in concert. I give \\"Silver Side Up\\" three stars because the songwriting, lyrics, and the album as a whole could of been much better. I await the next Nickelback album.
B000002B1M|5.0|This is the 3rd best of nas with stillmatic and illmatic ahead of it,it is slightly better then I Am,nastradmas isn't close to any of them,buy the cd just for &quot;the message&quot;,peace
B00005JKQX|5.0|Not only does Director Ron Howard find a way into the schizophrenic mind in a way those watching can actually see, but Russell Crowe gives a dynamic performance.  Russell Crowe slips his own skin in this movie and totally becomes John Nash.  I watched for cracks in the performance and found none. I was moved to tears that Mr. Crowe did not get the Oscar for this performance.  The movie is well written, moves along at a great pace and is brilliantly acted.  A winner all the way around......
1558216847|1.0|TOTAL HOGWASH, A FAIRY TALE IF I'VE EVER READ ONE.   IT SHOULD HAVE STARTED OUT 'ONCE UPON A TIME.'   I DO NOT MIND READING A GOOD YARN BUT THIS ONE TRIES TO SELL ITSELF AS A TRUE ACCOUNT.  READERS ARE NOT THAT GULLIBLE.   I RATE IT FOUR STARS FOR THE STORY BUT TAKE AWAY THREE FOR SAYING IT'S A TRUE STORY.
B00005U11Z|5.0|If you were ever a fan of Journey or a fan of 70's and 80's rock music this disc is a must to own.  Don't let the fact that Steve Perry is no longer with the band sway you from this DVD.  New singer Steve Augeri holds his own with Perry and if you close your eyes you might not notice a difference.  One of the best sounding concerts I have next to the Eagles DTS disc.  Oh, by the way, these are some of the greatest rock songs ever.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This has got to be the best movie i NEVER wanted to watch. My friend suggested it to me the first i heard of it but i was not at all interested.  One more reason why you should not judge a book by its cover.  you see, outwardly this movie reaks of boredom and shall i say gayness.  Once you get yourself to watch it tho, you'll discover this magical british production of great calliber.  The story is set in 1984 or 5 during the coal miners strike in durham, northeast england.  A family suffering through the loss of their mother and the poverty of a coal mining town finds beuty in life through billy, the younger of the two boys.  Billy is kicked around by his father, his peers and worst of all his older brother... He one day stumbles in to a ballet class and truely discovers himself.  The movie has one of the funniest dialogues i've come across in a long time, if you can get through the accent.  the accent is not quite british and not quite irish.... its funny.  The heart of the movie is just about self expression, comeing into your own and transcending those everyday things that hold us down.  Billy Elliot is a movie that will be enjoyed by all viewers alike, i guarantee it.  This movie has also inspired me to take dancing lessons!  but dont worry you macho guys out there.  This movie has some violence and plenty of cursing to keep you happy.  But whats more is that this movie touches that area inside of us that we all have.  Some show it and some dont, some dont even know they have it.  That is what is so brilliant about this movie.  It brings out the billy elliot in all of us!
0843174218|5.0|This was my favorite Mr. Men/Little Miss book as a wee whipper snapper. Now I am sharing these stories with other people's children.  Kids find them just as amusing today as I did then, and (eep!) now I can even see how us adults do, too!  The books in the series range from great to average to pointless; and while I have not read them ALL (there are SO many), Mr. Messy is at the top of my list.  He's messy, he's cute, he's charming, and he's paid an unexpected visit from Mr. Tidy and Mr. Neat.  And from the lesson standpoint, this book persuasively illustrates how much \\"nicer\\" things are when they're clean rather than blatantly telling children to clean up after themselves.  The end was the best part, but I won't spoil it by telling!  Modest in length, colorful pictures on each page, and easy enough for kids of all ages to understand, these quirky  books are great for early readers one step up from Dr. Seuss.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I initially avoided this film on the basis that Nicole Kidman was in it. But my friends, who know what a sucker for a musical I am, finally coaxed me into watching it. Now, they're sorry they did -I'm obsessed with it! I couldn't be more pleased that it won for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design at the Oscars last night; they were certainly deserved. This is one of the most beautiful films, just aesthetically speaking, that I've ever seen. Take into account the music, to say nothing of the beautiful and talented Ewan McGregor (whose films Moulin Rouge prompted me to catch up on; I highly recommend you do the same!), and you've got an unbeatable film that's got it all - beauty, humor, drama, and music.
B000003BEV|5.0|This may have been the Stones' answer to Sgt. Pepper, but it was clearly influenced by Pink Floyd's Piper At the Gates of Dawn.  Bill Wyman's In Another Land could've easily fit on that album.  The rest is pure period psychedelia that is nothing short of satisfying when you're in that kind of mood.<br />Pepper didn't get this psychedelic and after Revolver, you can count the number of psychedelic Beatles songs on one hand.  This album came out six months after Piper and most songs consist of ambiguous lyrics, which was commonplace in every Syd Barrett song, whether he meant to do it or not.  <br />Their Satanic Majesties Request is a far cry from Piper At the Gates of Dawn, which, in my opinion is in the top 10 rock albums of all-time, but it's required psychedelic listening.  Put this, Piper, Anthem of the Sun by the Grateful Dead, and the Soft Machine on random and leave the LSD behind.  These guys did it for you.
6303306519|2.0|This is one of those movie's that can't really decide what it wants to be.  On the one hand it could be seen as a satire on the capitalist, greedy society.  On the other it is a silly teen movie with big ideas that it doesn't pull off.  The plot has a teenage jock listening to a tape of his sister talking to their parents in a way that suggests incest.  The next thing you know, the guy that played the tape is killed in a tragic road accident.  Is he imagining it or is something really happening right under his nose?<br />This plays out as a typical teen movie, with a gorgeous cast that the camera ogles at every opportunity.  Given what is to happen later the almost constant sexual references are perhaps relevant.  However, given the fact that there isn't a solid ending in sight and the sheer gratuity of much of what's here, it's hard to concentrate on any message that Yuzna may have been trying to get across.  Indeed, even if its basic message of 'society will devour itself' is a fine central idea but if a movie is going to serve up incest then it should at least explore it.<br />The acting isn't important, with a lot of bland yet beautiful faces on display.  There are some truly eye-popping special effectsn though and nobody will forget the gross-out finale due to how distasteful it is.  It's definitely an interesting film but purely because of its ending.  Apart from that there's little of note.
B00005QB42|5.0|I was first introduced to this amazing recording on a by Jenni Fox and Paul Gould on a yoga-nia vacation in Mexico.  Evey time I hear it it takes me back to that beautiful beach.  Since then I have purchased over 50 copies of this album, everyone who hears it loves it, and wants to know where to purchase it.  Thanks Amazon, for finally listing it.
B000002BBY|5.0|Between the callow, uninteresting Definitely Maybe and the pathetic, preening excess of Be Here Now lies (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, the one time that Oasis--perhaps despite themselves--truly managed to get it right.<br />Why the comparisons between Oasis and the Beatles?  If the Beatles knew anything, it was how to fashion a devastating pop hook, and hooks are few and far between on Be Here Now, and almost completely absent on Definitely Maybe.  Despite WtSMG's melancholy tone, however, the hooks come fast, furious, and irresistable.<br />WtSMG has a balanced clarity that few albums, Oasis or otherwise, seem to be able to pull off:  everything is sharp and intense.  And everything works, starting with the acoustic guitar, which is like a window thrown open in the cramped, smoke-filled room that was Definitely Maybe.  Liam's brash, arrogant voice is at the peak of its abrasive charm here.  The nostalgia that he and Noel affect may be self-conscious, but it comes across as genuine.  The mournful cello in \\"Wonderwall\\" fits perfectly with its themes of anticlimax and confusion.  The sighing chorus of \\"Cast No Shadow\\" is rich with despair, while the next track, \\"She's Electric,\\" is bursting with a reckless joy, and both are equally infectious.  Even the album's two low points, \\"Some Might Say\\" and \\"Morning Glory,\\" have their own engaging energy.  Each song creates its own seductive little world, fully-formed and with its own story to tell; yet a thread moves through each, that of moving on.  Noel may not know where he's going, but he's pretty sure it will be better than where he's been.  Not true, as it turned out.  But here, at least, he can make you believe it.<br />And then there's \\"Champagne Supernova,\\" an album-ender to end all album-enders.  I can think of other songs that encapsulate me in a tumbling euphoria--Soulstice's \\"The Reason,\\" Stone Temple Pilots' \\"Seven Caged Tigers,\\" Spring Heel Jack's \\"Suspensions,\\" Crash Palace's \\"Sit and Watch the Sky,\\" Orbital's \\"Out There Somewhere?\\" Soundgarden's \\"Like Suicide,\\" Blue Six's \\"Pure,\\" Bjork's \\"Cvalda\\"--but \\"Champagne Supernova\\" may well trump them all, and even if the rest of the album [wasn't good], it would still be worth it for this one orgasmic seven-minute ride.  The story, the narrator reuniting with an old friend after a long time spent apart, reflecting on the bond which has held them together across time and space, and sharing his grandiose optimism for the future, finds intense life in Liam's yearning vocals and the aching, determined, crashing music.<br />OK, so maybe that wasn't such a convincing defense.  Taste in music is primarily a matter of association, and I have plenty of that for WtSMG, which never fails to raise the summer of 1996 like a treasure-filled galleon from deep waters, and for that gift alone I can't help but recommend it.al's \\"Out There Somewhere?\\" Soundgarden's \\"Like Suicide,\\" Blue Six's \\"Pure,\\" Bjork's \\"Cvalda\\"--but \\"Champagne Supernova\\" may well trump them all, and even if the rest of the album [wasn't good], it would still be worth it for this one orgasmic seven-minute ride.

B000059Z8J|5.0|I couldn't get enough of this movie as a kid.  I'd watch it over and over everyday.  <BR>I'm now 26 and am thrilled to own this on DVD.  It is still my favorite movie ever.  <BR>The movie looks incredible and the sound is phenomenal.  John Williams' score still gives me goosebumps.<BR>Christopher Reeve is by far the best Superman and Gene Hackman is equally awesome as Lex Luthor.  The opening scenes with Marlon Brando are great too.  There are simply too many thing to mention about this movie.  <BR>The added scenes along with all the great extras definitely put this in the 'must have' category.<BR>You can't go wrong with this one.
B000021XR5|4.0|I know, I know: you look at the cover, with the big white star and little else, compare it to the slick razzle-dazzle of STP's other four album covers, you consider the non-title, and you think, \\"So, they refuse to put any creativity into this whatsoever? An album with that title and that cover design can't be any good, can it?\\"<br />Don't be fooled.<br />After taking their group all over the stylistic map with Tiny Music, it's like the Deleo brothers threw up their hands and said, \\"Well, so much for that idea. Back to square one.\\" And that's just what No. 4 is--square one. It's a return to the harder, bigger, grittier sound they had when they started. This is, in short, the true sequel to Core.<br />Despite the religious titles and lyrics, this album is not an expansion on the themes of \\"Naked Sunday.\\" The lyrics, on the surface, seem to deal with unrequited love, but you don't have to be a probation officer to see that the overarching subject is Weiland's drug of choice. When he sings \\"It's the craving for the good life/that sees me through,/when my mind begins to wander/to the spoon,\\" he's not talking about fighting off a yen for Cocoa Puffs. On \\"Sour Girl\\" he dishes \\"The girl got reasons ... they all got reasons,\\" but it's not too tough to figure out what makes him hard to live with.<br />This is, in my opinion, the least worship-worthy of the Pilots' five LPs, and is definitely a step down from the easy bliss of Talk Show. It's missing something, though even after having listened to it countless times I can't put my finger on what that could be. Maybe, as another reviewer noted, it's that Scott's voice tends to get lost against Dean's guitar. But that was probably a wise move--Scott attempts his old \\"Jeremy's spoken\\" baritone on five out of eleven tracks, but he just doesn't have the range to quite pull it off, not the way he could in the early 90's. Maybe, as another reviewer suggested, it's just that they were trying too hard.<br />But this is STP we're talking about, and despite its flaws, No. 4 is a great, great album. \\"Heaven & Hot Rods,\\" \\"Pruno,\\" \\"No Way Out,\\" \\"Glide,\\" and \\"Sex & Violence\\" all have a huge, classic sound, with STP's trademark devastating hooks and rousing choruses. At the same time, the boys find room for playfulness, with the engagingly poppy \\"Sour Girl,\\" the swanky country-western ballad \\"I Got You\\" (a track that could've been just a big joke but instead, under Rob's sure hand, is simply big), and \\"MC5,\\" which actually is just a big joke, but which also sounds like the Stone Temple Pilots official theme song. The album's only disappointment, for me, is the closing track, \\"Atlanta.\\" It starts off great, a sensuous, ascending acoustic ballad with Scott doing an astounding re-creation of Jim Morrison (and it's funny, considering that STP has their own untouchable mojo, how they can be so chameleonic at times--even if they had no creative talent of their own, they'd have made a fine cover band), but then just gets repetitive and kind of annoying. Oh, and then there's \\"Church on Tuesday,\\" with its weak fade-out ending.<br />Other than that, No. 4 is a gem. If you like Core but for some reason don't have this, all I can say is, you don't know what you're missing.
014028009X|5.0|Just the thing if you're looking for some light reading. This really is a laugh out loud book. Fielding captures in Bridget what every single woman has gone through or thought at some point in her life. If you're a Singleton then it definitely makes you feel that you're not alone in what you thought were some of your unique habits or quirks. Bridget has them all.<br />The only problem I had with the book was it's Britishness.  Luckily I've had a British boyfriend so I figured out rather quickly what the 9st2's meant, but I wonder how other Americans fared with this. I'm sure I would have enjoyed the book even more had I been familiar with the references to British personalities, TV shows, etc. Nevertheless, there is enough there to keep you grinning, laughing and turning the pages.<br />I've also read the sequel, The Edge of Reason, and it's just as good.  I'm hoping for more Bridget books.
0446608955|3.0|I read A Walk to Remember at the frantic insistence of my best friend who, after reading it in one sitting, proclaimed it the best book she'd ever read.  I, however, have yet to conclude why everyone is so in love with this book.  Yes, it's a very sweet (though sometimes very cheesy) love story, but it was so predictable that it was almost dull.  Sparks's foreshadowing leaves absolutely no room for surprises.  If you're a diehard fan of love stories, you'll probably like it...otherwise, I'd pass.
B000002JNN|4.0|I found this CD to be a excellent tool when one have<BR>to get 5 kids out of bed in the morning - this CD is <BR>the best one produced by AC/DZ no doubt. Usually one only<BR>like one or two songs, but here I enjoyed almost all of <BR>it. This is no bad rating coming from a guy who usually<BR>only listen to bluegrass and classical music.
B000001TAX|5.0|I'm giving this 5 stars for the content alone.  Any less would be plain disrespectful to one of the greatest reggae albums ever recorded.  BUT, skip this, the VP version, and immediately go buy the Blood &amp; Fire remastered version.  Comparing the sound quality is like comparing dawn to midnight.  The Blood &amp; Fire version also has a second disc of bonus material that easily makes the difference in price irrelevant.
B00005YTFG|4.0|Moulin Rouge is most definitely a musical written for the MTV generation.  The editing is wild and frenetic, to the point where many of the dance scenes are nigh unwatchable and the songs are all (excepting one written specifically for the movie) reworks of very famous pop and musical songs from the '40's right on up until modern times.  The plot is about as deep as a rain puddle, and the writing goes absolutely nowhere that hundreds of writers haven't gone before.<br />However, despite all this, the movie is quite original and incredibly fun.  Every single aspect of the production - the costumes, special effects, make-up, art direction and set design - is absolutely top notch.  The songs, while by definition are not original, are very well remastered and performed well.  And while the script is nothing special, the acting and directing raise the text to a higher level than it manages to acheive on its own right.<br />As to the DVD specifically, this is the greatest set of extras that this reviewer has personally ever seen on a DVD.  You are able to watch the dance sequences from multiple angles, as well as in extended versions.  There is dialogue on almost every single aspect of the making of the movie, commentary from the cast, the ability to watch the movie with glimpses behind the scenes - use of blue screens, rejected scenes, and so on - while the movie is still going without having to skip to a special features menu.  And this is not even all.  Definitely a top notch production of a DVD.
6304765231|5.0|Yes, I could say that it was tragic...the loss of Brandon...but enough with the cliche pertaining to this film.   <br />One must watch this movie for MICHAEL WINCOTT who plays Top Dollar.  The man is creepy, sinister, wicked, charismatic and sexy.  I wish I was the Asian he was cavorting with in that film.  This is just one of the many films that Mr. Wincott appears in which he showcases his psychotic best.  He is the consumate villain: beautiful and magnetic.  <br />Cheers Michael.  I have enjoyed your work thoroughly this past years.  I hope you get that role that will make you a household name...although...I like the cult status better, I feel you deserve the recognition...
B000002KP3|3.0|This was a ground breaker, yes it was. Would it be today?  This album was the pablem Future rockers drank...it was 70's background music. One step removed from Gary Glitter...(along with Queen) who as we all now probably collects royalties from every baseball and football stadium in the country.  It was heavy, it rocked and it was probably released around Christmas to help boost sales.
B000002UAX|5.0|I find this album to be one of the greatest of all time!  A great combination of all types of music ranges.  From country, to classical...it is a fabulous addition to any music collection and simply one you cannot do without!!  Each time I listen to \\"Julia\\"...John Lennon captures me with his mournful voice.  \\"Long, Long, Long\\" by George Harrison almost sends me into a dream that delves into his thought-provoking lyrics.  \\"While my Guitar Gently Weeps\\" speaks for itself...And \\"Sexy Sadie\\"...makes ME feel smooth and sexy. Just all around magical!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|A friend of mine had the lyrics to neon in her instant messenger profile, and I was immediately taken with them, so much so that I downloaded every John Mayer song possible.  Then, I bought the CD.  Only 24, John has some of the best lyrics out there, capturing the pains of lost love and loneliness in &quot;Love Song For No One,&quot; where he &quot;stays at home alone on a Friday. Flat on the floor looking back on old love. Or lack thereof. After all the crushes have faded. All my wishful thinking was wrong. I'm jaded. I hate it.&quot;  Or tenderness and admiration in &quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland: Something 'bout the way the hair falls in your face. I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillow case. You tell me where to go and, though I might leave to find it, I'll never let your head hit the bed without my hand behind it.&quot;  Who has never felt like this?  John has principally described himself as a guitarist, but his lyrics capture the emotions of any person who has ever been 18-24 or who is 18-24. This CD takes you on a whirlwind tour of John's search for self-identity; the lyrics entice you, the guitar seduces you.  And after it's over, you want to hit the play button again and again.
B00005V0X5|5.0|The reproduction of this release is awesome. You can actually here Sam's Drums come into play. All the song's on this release have life on it's own. Not to say the first realse was a bomb but you have to remember that they didn't have enough money to really show they're true creativity.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Recently I was travelling down the interstate late on a Monday night listening to the local UW-Milwaukee radio station.  I was flipping through the stations searching for something good to listen to.  Upon hearing &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, the dial stopped spinning as I was intently listening to her radio interview.  She followed up that track by playing the title track, &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;.  There is a very unique quality to her voice and the music gels with it very well.  I like its mellow quality and would recommend the CD to anyone who can appreciate music period.
B00005QZWI|5.0|First of all, congratulations to Mr. Shore for winning the Academy Award.  It is well deserved.  <br />I first purchased this CD in January and have listened to it practically every day since that time. The music takes you to another place, which is exactly what it should do.  I am always amazed with the way Howard Shore combined the different instruments to create such a grand sweeping vista.  I know I am in Middle Earth when I hear the music. <br />I have been collecting soundtracks since falling in love with the theme from Exodus many, many years ago.  But upon hearing this one for the first time, it totally blew me away.  I had no trouble associating the music with the sequences in the film.  It brought tears to my eyes. <br />I love all of the tracks, but primarily #1, which sets the &quot;feeling&quot; of the film, #2 which just feels like happy-go-lucky hobbits living in one of the most beautiful places on &quot;middle earth&quot;, #17 with the exquisite vocals of Edward Ross and of course #18 with Enya's amazing vocalizations.  I am very pleased to add this and all future &quot;Rings&quot; compositions to my collection.  It is a MUST purchase!
B00005JKQX|5.0|I've had at a movie in years!  Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connolley were absolutely incredible!!  I think Russell Crowe didn't get the Oscar just from his usual antics in the industry but most definitely deserved it from his beautiful performance.  This movie pulled at every emotional part of my body.  The only movie of 2001 deserving of Best Director and Best Picture.  An absolute must see for everybody and a collector's item!!
B000062Y98|5.0|Welcome to the Night at the Opera! Please take your seat to see A new exciting world of Music! Blind Guardian on this release went a step into a much more epic sound. My only complates are that the choir stuff gets in the way some times and you miss some things said, and that being said you will have to listen to this album a few times to begin to like it. This album is pretty much very rich of flavour so theres so much you will miss in the first listening. Now on to my review of the songs:   1. Precious Jerusalem - A fast crazy start to the album. I detect a few old Blind Guardian pieces in there, but as you can see things have changed in overall design of songs by this first.  . . .85%2. Battlefield - All of war. Pain and Pride of War. In short, You will have to hear it to understand.  . . .90%3. Under The Ice - Odd music to start it, but then we begin to understand the evil and how it shall end. . . .90%4. Sadly Sings Destiny - A heavy, but possitive song. It is about jesus I think, tho I'm a little confused if it was song to defie such thoughts or to indorse them.  . . .85%  5. The Maiden and The Minstrel Knight - Soft song that is possitive, and expresses a great del of pain and confusion. heres the ch. \\" will you still wait for me, will you still cry for me, come and take my hand\\". . .95% 6. Wait For An Answer - I like this song alot. It seems plain decently paced song with chechy guitar everywhere. Truely a epic song!  . . .100%7. The Soulforged - A more simple song that has midevil sound in it in the middle. Not much to this one  . . .80% 8. Age Of False Innocence - Very Soft intro, Soft singing but it moves to heavyer music and singing. Your probably like it, I did.  . . .95%9. Punishment Divine - Heavyer than the rest. A song of Pride and the way of war.  . . .95% 10. And Then There Was Silence - Yes this song over 14 minutes long. It's a epic all the way, It requires a lot of playing to like due to the length. I would give it at this time  . . . 90%   11.Mies Del Dolor (Spanish version of :\\"Harvest of Sorrow\\") - What can one say about this? it's great sounding accoustic with spanish singing. If you perfer to hear the song in english you should get a copy of the single \\"And Then There Was Silence\\". . . .90%  If you like this album, you may wantto check out the following albums: Blind Guardian -Nightfall in middle Earth, Demons & Wizards -Demons & Wizards, Iced Earth -Horror Show, Felconer -Felconer, Gamma Ray -No World Order.
B00005NWM3|4.0|Being in my mid 30's, I can barely stomach listening to a lot of the newer popular rock/alt. rock bands of the last 4 yrs or so.How does Nickelback remind me? They(and another great band:Oleander) remind me of how things were done in the early and mid-nineties, when alternative rock Rocked.<BR>  Got their 1st U.S. CD &quot;The State&quot; after hearing &quot;Breathe&quot; on the radio,and breathe I did, because it was a breath of fresh air in rock.<BR>  &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; is a fine follow up.&quot;How You Remind Me&quot; has been totally overplayed, but always sounds good on the radio.&quot;Too Bad is a great rock song, the lead singer really wails in &quot;Never Again&quot;,&quot;Money Bought&quot; &amp; &quot;Good Times Gone&quot; are really good too.Over all this CD flows together well and has some nice touches like slide guitar and neat drum grooves.<BR>  Sometimes the subject matter of this CD is a little too much on the down side, but never come across as depressing as Staind or Fuel(good sounding bands though).

B000002534|4.0|Carlos can shred the frets with the best, but the musically he is incomparable when he plays the absolutely right single note where lesser guitarists would play ten or even a hundred. And that's my reservation with this this record - in choosing to play fast jazzy tunes (extrememly well, I might add) he gives up a fair measure of the specialness about his playing. <br />Not that this is a bad record, indeed its a very good one. But it suffers in comparison to the delightful Caravanseri, which you should buy and listen to atentively if you want to hear Santana at his most masterful and spiritual.
B00004TH6O|2.0|This cd is bad folks.  It has two bright spots, both are songs that have Mark Lanegan on vocals.  Another song he sings on, not even he could save.  I really enjoy the song Into the FADE, but as for the rest of the cd, the only cd I have bought that I liked less was MONSTER by REM.  The only thing that made that worse, was the band is so good, that the expectations were higher for REM.  Queens of the Stone Age have recruited Mark Lanegan as a contributing force, and I will buy the cd to hear his voice, but as big of a fan as I am, if it's as bad as RATED R, I will be back here and trying to keep you from buying it too!  Buy his solo cds, and his CDs with Screaming Trees, but stay away from Rated R.  Into the Fade is not worth the 12 dollars the cd will cost you.  As always, be well people, and listen to music that fills your soul, not this which fills your toilet!
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is a Pink Floyd album that has become more and more relevant with time. Sometimes this album has been overlook because of Dark Side of The Moon or the Wall but this work satnds side by side with these two albums. Animals is one of the best concieved and performed concept albums in rock history. The music and the lyrics go hand by hand much better and direct that The Wall for example. <br />Today songs from this album have surface in Pink Floyd and Roger Waters recent In the flesh tours and their performance stands out in the set list as the highlight of their shows. Also, recently Les Claypool recorded a live performance of the entire album as a tribute to this work. <br />This record promises many more years of mind expanding listening experience.

B00005U122|4.0|I had a chance to see Roger Waters last Sunday, March 17, 2002 at the 2002 edition of the Caracas POP Festival and his show just blew me away. This DVD is almost a note by note copy of the show I saw but even though that this an excelent DVD it doen not compare to the experience of being at the actual concert.<br />In The Flesh DVD has every tracked performed during the set and the sound quality is excelent. This is really a chalenge once you seen the show as the live set incorporates surround sound making the concert a mind blowing experience. In a way this DVD is the best next thing to being at the concert as it also incorporates 5.1 Dolby Digital sound reproducing many of the effects presented live.<br />The DVD offers excelent picture quality as one would expect from a Roger Waters production. This makes the DVD a plus over the Audio CD as it incorporates video and additional footage.<br />As with many DVD the extras are nice but not essencial. In fact one gets the usual documentary and photos. The real value in this release is the concert with an excellent performance by every band member.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is one of the Greatest Anime's you'll ever see! it is concidered by most to be one of the greatest. it is about a prince that is banished from his tribe because of a cursed wound.  He meets a girl that was raised by the wolves and falls in love with her.  This is a story about humanity vs. Nature.  It's animation is fantastic.  I would really sugest buying this DVD!
B000002A3T|5.0|Of course is hard too compare this recording to monumental works like The Wall, Animals, DSOTM or Wish you Were Here but those were other times and even another band. Division Bell is the return of Pink Floyd in the 90's not the return on the 70's Pink Floyd.<br />By taking this into account the record stands up today much better than at the time it was released as too much expectations from the public were over the band. The truth is that this album delivered memorable tunes like High Hopes, Marooned, Talk to me and others. The music in it is much better that the lyrics but that along makes the album an enjoyable listening experience.<br />The band sounds as profesional as they ever did and this time Gilmor and Co. are augmented by session musicians that added to the overall feel of the album and the tour that followed it. <br />As todat this seems to be Pink Floyd's last studio album and if so they leave with a high note!
0783226004|2.0|Though I enjoy this movie, I found the DVD version to be awful.  It looks like they cranked up the compression, as there is a ton of compression artifacting.  I could barely stand to watch the DVD in some places due to the little dancing color squares.  If you are a fan of Sneakers, get the VHS version and avoid the DVD.
B000063CPL|5.0|This live CD covers Iron Maiden Live at Rio the Janeiro in one of the most anticipated performance of the Rock in Rio Festival. The result is an impresive and powerful tour de force that shows how metal can improve with age an experience. <br />The highlight of the show is that the band made up of three guitar players as Adrian Smith returns to the band and plays along with Janick Gers and Adrian Smith for an amazing show of guitar melodies. To top this lineup Bruce Dickinson is also on the bill making this concert an unforgeatable one.<br />The set list is made up of an balance between new and older Maiden tunes and this set is a two CD one so there would be plenty of Maiden music to please fans. I had the chance to see and record this concert on Direct TV and the sound, the stage and the performance were among the best of this Rock festival.<br />During the taping of this concert Bruce Dickinson told the crowd that the concert was being taped for a concert DVD. If the managed to capture the vibe of that evening this DVD promises to deliver the goods!!!.
B000060P79|5.0|I have to say that until last Tuesday, I had no idea who Simple Plan was, but I saw them open for Sugar Ray, and now I'm hooked!!!  They have a great sound, and I have to say, they may be even better live than on CD. This is a great listen, great music and lyrics, kind of \\"alternative pop\\", I don't consider it \\"punk\\", but I'm old (30's), punk to me is Sid Vicious and the Ramones. My favorite tracks are \\"Worst day ever\\" and \\"You don't mean anything\\".  Give it a listen, you won't be disappointed!!!
B00005QK3B|5.0|Marillion's Misplaced Childhood stands the test of times and it is an example of a well though and putted togheter recording. In todays music and specially prog rock is hard to find a piece of work that is both musically and lyrically concise as this recording. <br />Some argue that this is Marillion at its best. I think that this is the best that Marillion did with Fish as they moved in other direction with their replacement H. (which I think has made a wonderfull job all these years!!) Misplaced Childhood has that something that makes a classic album. This is excelent performance and concept behing the songwritting which links the music to the ideas expressed in the lyrics. Just the three first tunes (Pseudo Silk Kimono, Kayleigh and Lavender) will go down in prog history as the best melodies/songs to start an album and hypnotize the listener. <br />The remastered edition of this and all the other Marillion records from this era is simply beautifully done. EMI has made a great effort to really bring added value to fans by putting relevand information and interviews as well as, in this CD, 17 tracks of new, alternate or previously unreleased material that is both good and essencial to the comprehensive understanding of the recording and writting process.<br />A good collection of prog rock both past and present should included this CD.
B00005R5G9|5.0|In an era where big hair, ripped jeans, and bad movies were the norm, Mannequin simply shines.  While not especially noteworthy as a film, it becomes memorable for the fact that it's not as stupid as most films in the 80s were.  The movie manages to remain charming and fun all the way through due to the eccentricty of its characters and good acting.<br />Cattrall and McCarthy are the strongest in this movie, and they manage to make you forget reality for a little while.  Cattrall's enthusiasm and innocence is well-balanced by McCarthy's skepticism and good humor, and they pull the viewer into the simple and often silly plot of an ancient Egyptian princess reborn as a mannequin who happens to fall in love with her maker who now works as a department store window dresser and the two have a Calvin and Hobbes-like relationship (Cattrall only comes to life when alone with McCarthy).  However, the most memorable character is Hollywood, the flamboyently gay and hysterical window dresser played by Meshach Taylor (Anthony from Designing Women).<br />Charming, simple, and fun, this is a great flick to put on the TV on a friday night while hanging out with friends or just that special someone.
067101756X|5.0|Having read the TOP Four books in the UFO/Alien/ Government Coverup Genre; My FAVORITE is 'Alien Rapture' by Brad Steiger (Great fiction-soon to be a movie); and Alien Agenda by the best selling author of 'Crossfire' Jim Marrs (Best reference on UFOlogy); and Unconventional Flying Objects (NASA UFO Investigator for 30 years) by the scientist Dr. Paul Hill, I'd say Corso's book is a MUST READ! <br />Why would a respected, decorated, connected Military Officer swear in a Court of Law that the UFO Conspiracy is real and that the facts and agenda in these books ARE TRUE. Why? If you read this excellent book and the others, you will know that they are indeed true. Two well respected American Astronauts have come forward to proclaim they had seen evidence of the Roswell UFO crash and stated they know the cover-up is real. Was his sudden demise a product of this conspiracy? You be the judge.

B0000634EV|4.0|Down II is another great album from this band.  If you liked the first one, you'll like this one.  It has that black sabbath influence like the original.  Phil's singing is more versatile in this album than the original.  It's overall a good all the way through album.  I can't say which down album I like better, although they stick to their original style, this album has a distinct sound.  You won't be disappointed if you are a down fan.
B00005KHL0|5.0|In the space of twenty two days in 1978 USC graduate John Carpenter created a classic of the horror cinema and was responsible for changing the course of horror<br />history. In the wake of his classic Halloween a veritable tidal wave of similarly themed normally masked maniacs hacked, slashed and stabbed their way across the cinema screen. Few however matched the terror contained within this film.<br /> It starts with a prologue set in 1963. Michael Myers, a six year boy, from the small town of Haddonfield kills his sister Judith Myers on Halloween night. He is then put away. The film then  cuts away to October 30 1978 and Myers breaks out of the<br />psychiatric hospital which he has been kept in since he murdered his sister. His doctor Loomis (Donald Pleasance) sets out in pursuit believing, correctly as it turns out, that Myers will return to his home town. When Myers returns to Haddonfield he attaches himself to a group of teenagers: sarcastic Annie (Nancy Loomis), bubble head Lynda (P.J. Soles) and the bookish Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis). During the course of the halloween night Myers proceeds to murder his way through the trio.<br /> The plot of Halloween was not wildly new, but what rises in to the class of a classic is Carpenter's handling of the material. Heavily influenced by such directors as Howard Hawks it takes a what could have been an exploitation picture and makes a<br />classic from it. The opening scenes which end with Myers as a six year old being met at the front door by his parents after stabbing his sister to death is one of the all time<br />classic shots from 1970s horror cinema. The numb look on the face of the actor whose plays Michael aged six (Will Sandin) seem to show that he both understands, but at the same time does not understand the significance of what he has does.<br />Incidentally the person who was holding the knife during the filming of this scene was Carpenter's then girl friend Debra Hill. She also wrote and produced the film. She went on to produce  a number of other films by Carpenter.<br /> Carpenter in the course of the film throws in numerous references to other films. One is the choosing of Jamie Lee Curtis to play the heroine. She is the daughter of Tony<br />Curtis and Janet Leigh. Leigh played the victim of the maniacal Norman Bates in Alfred Hitchcock's classic Psycho (1960) and the casting of her daughter as some one who survives a horror film was its way of playing her back. In addition the Psycho<br />comparisons do not end there with the naming of the doctor Loomis was surely another reference to the film. This film catapulted Curtis to fame and fortune, but it as<br />Laurie which she will forever be associated with in the eyes of horror fans. There is another reference to George Romero's classic zombie film Night of the Living Dead<br />(1968). When Laurie is trapped in the wardrobe Myers smashes his way in. During the course of it he hits the light causes it to strobe like in Romero's film which was in turn influenced by Hitchcock's. There is also a unintentionally huge debt of gratitude to Black Christmas (1975) in Carpenter's film. In it a group of sorority sisters are picked off one by one by an unseen psycho over the Christmas period. The point of view shots (POV) used by Carpenter are similar to the ones used by Christmas's<br />director Bob Clark. In addition Clark thought about writing a sequel in which the killer in the first film would have been caught, but escaped on halloween. He collaborated on this with Carpenter. The opening lengthy shot is similar to the one<br />which opens Orson Well's Touch of Evil (1958).<br /> The music and especially the instantly recognisable theme score were done by Carpenter. His usage of the soundtrack is very good and adds to the tension within the film. Ironically on the car journey towards the baby-sitting the music playing as Annie<br />and Laurie share a clandestine cigarette is Blue Oyster Cult's Don't Fear the Reaper.<br/>Another good thing which Carpenter did within the film was his use of Steadicam. The Steadicam was the invention of Garrett Brown and allowed hand held shots to be comparable to a tracking shot. This allowed to Carpenter to have elegant tracking<br />shots in which a good example was the lengthy shot which opens the film.<br /> The acting on display is good, but mention should be made of Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis. Pleasance was the film's one star name and upon whom most of the modest  budget was spent on. He turns in a fine if slightly over the top performance.<br />Some of his lines though do have an unexpected poetic flair. He would star in almost of the sequels and did get slightly type cast in  his roles. Curtis emerged as the film's star. She would go on to star in a clutch of similarly themed horror films including Carpenter's The Fog (1979) before becoming equally well known for her acting in such films as A Fish Called Wanda (1987).Although Halloween is now well over twenty years old the<br />scariness of the picture does not fade and it has become an acknowledged classic of the genre.

0380796090|5.0|I laughed until I cried...  This is the first and the best of Keyes' books.  I've read three of her other books, and they pale in comparison.  &quot;Lucy Sullivan Gets Married&quot; is decent, but kind of long.  Trust me, you'll laugh until you cry with this one.
B0000634EV|5.0|Having huge expectations for this album, it would be easy to be disappointed. However, that is most definitely NOT the case! This album is in every way a worthy follow-up to NOLA. In fact, Down II surpasses NOLA in many respects. I have to admit I am amazed at the diversity of this album, the variety of instruments and the high quality of song-writing shown throughout, and, again, I LOVED the first album! I mean who would have expected to hear a dobro, a Hammond organ and expressive, even melodic, singing on a Down album. In addition, it really sounds as if each member brought original ideas that their bread-and-butter bands (Pantera, COC, Crowbar, Eye hate God) would never touch (and, by the way, they all work). From the heavy stomp of Lysergik Funeral Procession and the Man that Follows Hell to the awesome Dog Tired and the immense Beautifully Depressed, there are hard, heavy rockers throughout. However, what really sets this album apart are the more mellow parts. Landing on the Mountains of Meggido, Learn from this Mistake and Where I'm Going are unlike anything you've ever heard before and Stained Glass Cross is as awesome as it is (dare I say it) catchy. The fact that it will never see the light of day on the radio is simply criminal. However, don't let that disuade you from purchasing this gem. It is easily the pinnacle of each members respective careers. Let's hope they have a few more left in them!
6302881005|1.0|Demi and Woody are married, but they're poor.  They meet Robert Redford, and he's REALLY rich.  He takes a fancy to Demi, and since he's a gambling man he makes the couple an &quot;indecent proposal:&quot; one million dollars for a night with the little woman.  And at this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the details together in your sleep.  Of course Demi is going to accept the offer. If she doesn't there's no first half of the movie.  Of course it will affect Demi and Woody's marriage.  If it doesn't there's no second half of the movie.  And of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credits roll.  If it doesn't, there's no happy ending.<br />The absolute best thing you can say about INDECENT PROPOSAL is that Demi Moore looks good in a black dress. As for the rest... The script is incompetent, the direction amateurish, the performances negligable.  I suspect Redford, Moore, and Harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned.  Do them--and more importantly yourself--a favor.  Unless some one offers you a million... Miss It!
0451527712|4.0|When being told I was to read Frankenstein for a college fiction class, I was not exactly thrilled.  I knew what Frankenstein was about, or so I thought. Although many movies have been made about Frankenstein, none compare to Mary Shelley's novel. Shelley captures human emotion like no movie can. The expression of anger, sorrow, and helplessness of the monster created cannot be seen in such movies.  Shelley's novel ties a completely fictional idea to real life in which everyone can relate.  There are many things that can be taken away from this novel aside from the whole &quot;man creating monster&quot; idea. For a look at real human emotion, this is a great read.

Bad comedy Bad writing and overall sour acting.
0684833395|5.0|i read this book after having it recommended to me several times and it is well worth reading. a lot of it is simply infuriating, full of backflashes, repetitive jokes and crazy word play. but all of that doesn't matter because the story and the great characters overcome these downfalls every step of the way. this isn't so much a book about war, more an insight into the lives of the people involuntarily involved in it. yossarian, the main character, believes that everyone is crazy and everyone in turn believes that he is the crazy one. yossarian would rather die than be killed and struggles everyday to avoid being involved in this war that others seem to revel in. it's beautiful and sad and i highly recommend it.
B00001QEE9|5.0|This film continues to be the standard against which all animation is measured. To think of all the hours spent in producing all the hand-drawn perfection seen in this film is staggering. Equal notice should be taken of the exceptional score and songs, themselves award-winning. &quot;When You Wish Upon A Star&quot; is so universally known today, one tends to forget it came from this film.<BR>The story of Pinnochio, the little wooden puppet given life for Geppeto the toy maker by the Blue Fairy is well-known. The intensity of the artwork and the tenseness of the story make it immortal. To be honest, very little children should watch with a parent, as some scenes are pretty scary, but I absolutely adore this film.<BR>Looking at the film today, it's so hard to believe it's over 60 years old! The picture transfer is flawless, and the soundtrack is superb. I do regret one thing: the complete lack of extras on this disc. One would think such an important film to the Disney studios would have been given more of a send-off to DVD, but really that's all I didn't like about the disc.<BR>Please, pay no attention to the lack of extras, just get the DVD for the film itself. Believe me, it's so very worth it!

B00003CXZ3|4.0|To put it precisely as possible, ~Memento~ is a smart film.<br />Taken from a short story written by his brother, Christopher Nolan crafted a screenplay and created a film that absolutely requires his viewers to engage and contemplate the story. No passive viewing allowed in this film. ~Memento~ requires full attention and engagement, otherwise there's no point.<br />The story concerns a poor soul by the name of Leonard Shelby, (Guy Pearce) who has contracted an untenable form of memory loss, due to an extremly violent attack, also leaving his wife dead. The problem with this form of amnesia, is that it is on going: Shelby knows who he is but cannot remember anything else fifteen minutes in the past. He cannot create new memories. Rather than sit in front of the television feeling sorry for himself and watching re-runs of 'Friends', (which, in a way, is another form of amnesia) the man is on an obsessed mission to find his wife's killer.<br />What would you do in the same position? Shelby's trade-off on actual memory is a brilliant system combining hand written notes, photos with relevant captions; and the real important memories, those of the 'etched' variety, he has made into tattoos. When he wakes up in the morning, it's back to his notes, re-orienting himself to why, what and where he is - this is an existential battle of the highest order, a perpetual war to remain in present time. What I find even more frightening: whom could you trust? These are the film's themes taken to the insane edges of possibility.<br />Guy Pearce's performance as the empty headed avenger is nothing less than brilliant. Throughout the film, he continued to repeat a subtle gesture - reaching behind his neck under his jacket and adjusting his shirt. The reason for this quirky mannerism is revealed at the end of the film. I mention this to illustrate Pearce's meticulousness as an actor. According to sources, his research as an actor is impeccable, focusing on the finer details of his character. Which begs the question: why not a nomination for best actor? This performance easily ranks in the top five for 2001-2. I believe the Academy has a similar condition to Leonard Shelby: any film released before June 2001 was forgotten and never got a mention. And that's a shame.<br />The London born director and writer has been dubbed \\"norish\\", \\"meta-noir\\" and \\"cerebral\\". What ever you call Christopher Nolan, the man took a great idea created by his brother and put it on the screen with elegance, charm and intellegence. Impressive.<br />This is a film that should be viewed more than once.cter. Which begs the question: why not a nomination for best actor? This performance easily ranks in the top five for 2001-2.

B0000634EV|3.0|I HAD LOW EXPECTATIONS OF THIS RELEASE DUE TO THE FACT THAT PHIL CAN SING BUT RARELY DOES IT IS USUALLY JUST SCREAMING AND NOT ALL THAT GREAT, HENCE I NO LONGER LISTEN TO PANTERA ALL THAT MUCH ANYMORE!  ON THIS RELEASE PHIL'S VOCALS WAIL AND THE LYRICS ARE GOOD! IT IS CRANKING STUFF AND THE GUITARS ARE VARIED AND EVEN BETTER YOU CAN HEAR REX FOR THE FIRST TIME! THE GUITAR SOLOES ARE NICE I KNEW KIRK COULD PLAY KICKING SOLOES! THE SONGS ARE MORE VARIED THAN THE 1ST DOWN W/CLEAN GUITAR PARTS HERE AND THERE.

0671688782|5.0|Holding Time, as described in Dr. Welch's beautiful book, is a two-way interactive physical and emotional expression of unconditional love and acceptance between parent and child of any age and between spouse, as well. I have found it to be equally beneficial to each of the holding pair.<br />There are other therapies that go by the name of holding therapy, but they mostly involve holding by the therapist. Don't confuse these other therapies with Dr. Welch's parent-child holding therapy. Welch therapy works directly upon the crucial bond that must be formed between parents and child. It is this bond that is the foundation of behavior regulation. And it is the direct bonding experience in Dr. Welch's therapy that makes it so much more effective than other therapies.
B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt is not only Alice in Chains' best album, it is also one of the five best albums of the entire alternative/grunge era (along with Nirvana's Nevermind, Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Superunknown, and Smashing Pumpkins' Siamese Dream).  Throw in this disc and you are instantly kicked in the face with the super-heavy opening riff of \\"Them Bones\\", and the ride doesn't get any smoother from there.  After the equally heavy \\"Dam That River\\", the album takes a dark and twisted turn leading you through the dementia & self-loathing associated with drug abuse.  A big difference from the cheesy pop-metal that was filling the airwaves prior to the \\"alternative Movement\\".  Dirt is a loose concept album that doesn't brighten up at any time.  From the suicidal rants of the title track to the haunting riffs of \\"Angry Chair\\", this album is a study in depression and can be emotionally draining to listen to.  These are all the things that make Dirt (and Alice as a band) so great.  Each tune is extremely well written (especially the stellar \\"Would?\\") as Jerry Cantrell's strange, but melodic riffs and solos beautifully work around the thunderous rhythm section, and Cantrell & Staley's voices blend so well together it's tough to tell the difference between the two.  Dirt is one of the few masterpieces of the 90's and should be in any music lovers' collection.
6305784116|5.0|Watching this film now,(as I do, often) I'm struck by how dated it seems now. At the time, the music and animation were considered cutting-edge, now it seems slightly archaic and old, which isn't to say it's a bad film, far, far from it. It's just that times and styles have changed so radically from when this film was made.<BR>The main feline charactors, Duchess and her three kittens, are irrepressible, and Thomas the wise-cracking alley cat, is a hoot. In the middle of the scheme to heist the cats, two old dogs are introduced who may be the funniest parts of the entire film, Napolean and LaFayette. Too funny for words!<BR>This film is really wonderful, and it came as something of a surprise to me, as I hadn't seen it before I got it when released on video. Now, I can't say how many times I've watched it. It's just a sweet, very enjoyable romp that can enjoyed by the entire family.
B0000507R0|5.0|this Amazing work lends itself well to multi channel surround. it is also a fine recording that shines in high resolution DVD audio! one curious point i will make is that on parts of &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and all of &quot;Benny the Bouncer&quot; alternate vocal tracks were used! why? i cant decide whether it is a pleasant suprise, or annoying. Lucky Man is added as a bonus track and it is very cool. this is the best DVD audio experience so far! i cant wait to hear the rest of the E.L.P. catalog remastered in DVD audio. hopefully we wont have to wait too long for Yes,Tull,Hendrix,etc to follow this trend
B00000HZFP|5.0|I was listening to this in the car yesterday and I was amazed at the fact that it still makes me cry. Back in the days when this show was at the Jane Street Theater there was this website called The Hedboard, all of us crazy fans would post rants over who we thought was the definitve Hedwig. I was sure that I needed to detach from it, so when the show closed, I put the CD away. It's playing right now and I am proud to say &quot;that the pain down in your soul was the same as the one down in mine&quot;. This is a great recording of the brilliant songs by Stephen Trask performed by the DEFINITIVE Hedwig, John Cameron Mitchell.
0671688782|5.0|The best way to describe the overall impact of Holding Time on our family life is that after staying with us for a few days a friend remarked that my husband and I didn't scream at each other or at the children any more and our life seemed much happier.<br />Before doing Holding Time I thought my growing lack of communication with my daughter (7) was due to her growing up and away from me. Holding her and becoming aware of her needs has changed that. We have a mutual loving relationship again.<br />I was finding it difficult to even be with my 4 year old and at times didn't even like him, and I was having a miserable time controlling him. After the time I spent doing Holding Time with him, his nursing school teachers have noticed a tremendous difference in him and he is now so sweet and affectionate that I love being with him.<br />We had a nanny come live with us when our 3rd child was born.

Now, he is 14 months old and after 8 months of regular daily Holding Time he is warm and loving  and smiles alot and I know who he is and he knows I am his mother. He trusts me.<br />Holding Time helped me to be a more nurturing mother and helped our family become functional.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|A great idea which does turn into a pretty good movie once the first 20 minutes of chaotic jumble is past.  Luckily I sat through the first 20 minutes AND made it to the real film which calms down a bit and takes on a decidedly better tone as the plot develops.<br />This is fantastic cinematography, creative &quot;lyrical recycling&quot; from many pop anthems of the last 30 years, and an inspiring love story to boot.<br />I was put off initially by the down-the-rabbit-hole approach of the beginning where I found the non-stop movement to be annoying, but after that I ended up really getting into this movie.  I found the ending very emotional!<br />Check it out, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
6305842442|4.0|Blade Runner is a classic, but how about releasing the orginal version? The directors cut eliminated Harrison Ford's narration. I own and appreciate being able to see the directors vision of Blade Runner, but I'd also like to be able to purchase the theater release.
0767802519|5.0|The Professional is a movie about a hit man named Leon who takes a little girl under his wing after her entire family is murdered. Leon (played by Jean Reno) is an amazingly complex character. He has a good heart, and refuses to kill women or children under any circumstances. The little girl makes Leon's life much more fun, but also puts him in grave danger when she decides to avenge her family's death. I loved this movie because the characters were so realistic, and yet so unordinary. You'll be surprised to see yourself loving and respecting someone who kills for a living.
B000000H6D|5.0|Type O Negative's Bloody Kisses is one of the most essential metal albums of the decade.  But do NOT buy this version of the album.  The essential version of Bloody Kisses is the original one, which starts off with \\"Machine Screw\\", \\"Christian Woman\\", and \\"Black No. 1\\" as the opening tracks.  Unfortunately, this re-release which for some reason struck Peter Steele as necessary, feels like only half an album.<BR>    The original version contained joke tracks such as \\"Machine Screw\\"  and \\"Fay Ray, Come Out and Play\\", as well as two more thrashy tracks: \\"Kill All the White People\\" is fairly simplistic, but powerful, and a lot of fun.  But the worst offense is the ommision of \\"We Hate Everyone\\", a brilliant song which touches on all of Type O Negative's musical bases, and delivers some piercing lyrics as well.<BR>    I guess they figured that these tracks were at odds with the more serious sounding tracks on the album.  But the album's appeal lies in the fact that while it is undeniably beautiful music, it doesn't take itself too incredibly seriously, and when it does, it's usually making fun of itself.  Without these omitted tracks, the album sounds completely different, and the new ordering makes absolutely no sense.  Do yourself a favor, and get the original release.  It's still available, and an essential purchase.
0671688782|5.0|When I first read about Holding Time, I felt a great sense of loss because I didn't know about it when I was raising my own daughter. That's why I would like to pass the information along to parents who still have the chance to use this most wonderfull method of deeply connecting and communicating with their children. <br />Holding Time is a special experience between mother and child where a space in time is created with no distractions. The results of the deep connection that is created have brought autistic children from a world of no communication back to one of close union with the parents. With normal children, Holding Time produces many kinds of success. This amazing technique helps many problems that arise with children, such as bed wetting, clinging, tantrums, lack of motivation, and sibling rivalry, because it gets to what is really being asked for under the acting out symptoms. It creates a very intimate and safe space for mother and child to communicate what is truly needed by the child.<br />When I read about Holding Time, I wished that I had known about it when I was raising my daughter. I think it would have given both of us the security we needed to experience each other in a physical and emotional way.
B00003003R|5.0|Okay, This album is great, and I'm just happy enough to see some GNR albums on the newly released stand at my record shop. This album is good, and although i may be biased (being a huge GNR fan), this is easily worth 5 stars for the songs alone. However, as a live album it fails to capture the essence of what made GNR one of the best live bands ever, if not the best live band ever. Solo's aren't present, and there are no intro's (except for its alright for November rain). They can at times sound a little flat towards some of the Illusions tracks, not getting the same power and energy of the appetite tracks. I was extremely disappointed that i didn't see the intro's of;<BR>*Sail away sweet sister for sweet child o mine,<BR>*only women bleed for knocking on heavens door<BR>*or mother for Paradise city.<BR>Not to mention that, but there is no stand alone solo's. If you are a fan of instrumentalist work, this will be a disappointment. Slash is probably the greatest guitarist of his time and I am immensely ashamed that they didn't have a track devoted to him.<BR>     This album really should of been 3cd's, GNR played that many shows and songs between 87 and 93, that filling them would be a breeze. Many of their bootleg shows are 3cd's anyway. The songs which I was disappointed that didn't cut it included civil war, bad obsession, think about you, locomotive, and there are many more. <BR>     AS for those people who have dissed Knocking on heavens door and some of the later tracks of CD#2 i would like to say that the end of CD#2 is my Favourite. Estranged is brilliant, Paradise city is as raw as it was in some of their earlier concerts, and Knocking on heavens door, although it makes you cringe at times (they play &quot;reggae&quot; half way through it) it has one of the only few times that you hear slash rip it to his guitar.<BR>     If you really want to get something that promotes GNR as a great live band, i would suggest to go for the two live in Tokyo video's. They are probably twice as good as live era, and you get to see the live as well as hear them at pretty much the same price. And if you really want to get into it, why not join the bootleg trade!<br />Overall I would rate this album as a best of special rather than a live album. I would of rathered they release a whole show with the whole drama's of a show, including solo's intro's and Axl's famous rants.
B000060OFT|5.0|This review is STRICTLY for the SPECIAL EDITION DVD of the film. To me it's already a given as to what a masterpiece Baz Luhrmann has put to the screen.<br />The special edition gives you all the treats you need.  I'm not talking about still pages of text to read!  I'm talking RAW footage of DiCaprio & Danes practicing their lines, many, many production scenes that leave your mouth open like, \\"oh, my gosh, I had no idea they had to go through all of that trouble just to shoot that brief scene\\"-kind of stuff, and best of all, an early treatment (pitch) for the film that was shot in Australia w/ DiCaprio in some alley ways.  Rather lengthy, not just a mini-clip, Amazing!  Insightful interviews of Baz Luhrmann; why do Shakespeare, how difficult it was to sell the idea to Hollywood, why he made the movie in the style that it is, etc.).  If you have the original DVD & are debating, go for it!<br />The only disappointing thing was the production value of Claire Danes' interview... DiCaprio's interview is well produced & lit on a candle-filled set, then Claire Danes is terribly keyed (matted) over a few still images (her hair buzzing & breaking through the digital distortion). The menus are nicely done, not animated over-kill. This is an anamorphic for those who have the 16:9 TVs.<br />I haven't even listened to much of the commentary yet, but it sounds very informative & interesting so far.  Perhaps the most important thing for those who did not like the film or were unsure, is Luhrmann's explanation of why Shakespeare should have been handled the film the way he did (the intense, in-your-face MTV-like editing / modern settings, etc)... truly both men are very visionary & talented.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Monsters Inc. is the story of a monster named Sully and his sidekick Mike. Sully works for an energy company that uses children's screams to power the entire city of Monsteropolis. However, monsters must be very careful when scaring children because the touch of a child is extremely toxic. Therefore, when a child comes through the closet door porthole into Monsteropolis, Sully and Mike have a big problem on their hands.<BR>   I loved this movie because it was funny, had great animation, and was full of suspense. However, it seemed that the movie wasn't nearly as good for children. The adults in the theatre laughed throughout the whole movie, but the children barely laughed at all. The problem is that both the plot and the jokes were on an adult level. I would recommend this for fun-loving adults, but not necessarily for children.
B00000J6AG|4.0|Never cared too much for Moby, although I loved the inclusion of 'God Moving Over the Face of the Waters' at the end of the Pacino/De Niro film 'Heat'.  An amazing moment in cinema history.  I remember hearing snippets of this disc all over the place-way before I knew it was Moby.  Finally, all the hype got to me I guess, and I bought it.  I was not disappointed.  This is a wonderful collage of old rustic blues samples, heavy beats, and melancholy keyboard work.  I'm not sure I go quite as far as some in praising this disc, but it is mighty good.  There are a few throw-away tracks for me, but on the whole it is solid and compelling.  A MUST.
B000002UJQ|5.0|the best thing i can say about this album (and the Bends) is that it made me want to make music. the way the lyrics and instrumentation meld into a formless yet directional mode of expression makes for a truly moving experience. it fascinated me to the point that i had to see what there was inside of me that could communicate the spectrum of emotions that i've felt throughout my life. for what it's worth, i've found something that will stick with me. the piano and the guitar have become the canvases upon which i paint my emotions and explore places within myself that i've never been before. more than anything, this music has made me understand more fully the connection between music and humanity. i never knew someone's voice could sound so fragile and yet still move me with the strength of a full orchestra. this is courageous music, unafraid of its despair and uncompromising in the depth of its \\"message\\". for me, the \\"message\\" has been that we shouldn't be afraid to confront the struggle for humanity because the struggle is, in itself, a beautiful endeavor. <br />if music moves you, if it can make you cry, dance, and love then you should check this album out. and i hope it's as influential for you as it has been for me.<br />(btw, my ex-girlfriend passed out at a radiohead concert because she was so moved by the experience [or maybe it was the glue-sniffing binge that got to her], and this is insane, but thom yorke was singing the phrase \\"we hope that you choke\\" as she fell limp in my arms. the next song they played as i frantically ran for help... no surprises.)

B00005JKEC|1.0|I kept hoping for a morale to this ugly movie.In fact, I tried and this is the conclusion I came to:  If this movie causes the LAPD to be forced to clean up its act then the movie will have a redeeming factor.  The movie is so full of violence and \\"shockers\\" that I became bored with them and was anxiously awaiting it to end.  If I had been the rookie, I would have had the bad cop stop the car and let me out when he offered the pipe.  End of movie; but, no, we are somehow \\"required\\" to buy into the training day \\"test\\" proposition. The rookie was an idiot at every turn running the gauntlet knowing it was all rotten to the core--for what purpose.  The prize? A big home in a better area of the burbs for his wife and daughter while he rolled in filth all day.  The only thing he said in this film that rang true was that he should have been a firefighter.If this is LA, California should drop into the ocean.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|This is a deep psychological thriller based on the some of the freakiest elements of memories and revenge. I'll tell you right now it's not the kind of movie everyone likes. It's dark, deep, weird, and intellectual! The plot is not easy to understand, but it is thoroughly amazing. And that's all I am going to say...except if you get it hang on for your life; you're in for a thrilling ride! It is one of the best pieces of literature produced in our age.
B000005DQR|5.0|someone gave me this album in the summer of 97 and i wasnt really interested in music of any sort at the time.i was only 16 and i was just realy an easy listener,but,this album changed my musical life.now 5 years on im so hapy i heard that record,composing my own beats and enjoying it,the fact that it is still my favourite record shows how visionary it was,its still standing the test of time.my favourite has to midnight in a perfect world or building steam with a grain of salt.dj shadow....visionary....genius....life changer.youd be crazy not to own this

B00005JKYS|5.0|You will not meet a bigger braveheart fan than me.  The chances are REALLY slim.  With that said, let's talk about Mel Gibson's stunnig performance in 'We Were Soldiers'.  I had the opportunity to read the book before watching the movie, and let me tell you that if you see this movie, reading the book is going to make you like it a whole bunch more.  After the release of Braveheart, and then The Patriot, I was a bit reluctant.  The first thing I was imagining was Mel running down the side of a hill and screaming FREEDOM!  Either for America of for Scotland.  LOL   We really don't need another braveheart.  But, Still with that said I went to watch it out of respect to my favorite actor.  And, I was shocked.  The movie was wonderful.  It wasn't some Hollywood remix of the book version.  Instead, it is a wonderful depiction and visual masterpeice of the first battle in Vietnam.  Watch This Movie.  If you don't you don't have any idea what your missing.  :)
6305508550|3.0|I actually thought this was a pretty clever movie, I found myself busting a gut laughing at many points. However, the horrible, drag-me-down soundtrack made me want to kick a hole through my speakers! If anyone can re-cut a version of this movie with real music, it would be one of my favorites. As it stands, I will probably never watch it again.
1563890119|4.0|this is a great intro into the rest of neil gaiman's sandman series.  it's probably just me but dr.destiney is realy funny.  The part with the kids show in the cafe is hilarious. also he is so funny in the way he stands in the middle of the road with a gun to get a ride.
B00005QW4K|4.0|This review refers to the \\"Official Bootleg Edition\\" -- brown paper bag.<br />This is a 1992 film that I wish would have transferred better to DVD.  Many times the picture is blurry and out-of-focus.  It is also not a true widescreen presentation.<br />However, the framing, composition, and action sequences are so nicely done that I've bumped it up to 4 stars.  You will have to watch this DVD in darkness or a totally blackened room because the final fight scene is so dark one can barely make out the action.  Perhaps this is because of animation and is necessary to cover up strings, etc.<br />Music and sound are good, not great, and there is a bit of surround sound.  How refreshing to have a movie NOT end with a rap song.<br />The female lead Embeth Davidtz is very beautiful and a real treat for the eyes.  Very much a plus added to this movie.<br />The skeleton war is advanced for cinema, past and present, and puts \\"The Mummy\\" and \\"The Mummy Returns\\" to shame.<br />I feel that the movie holds up on its' own, but recommend watching the two previous \\"Evil Dead\\" movies so you know who Ash is.  There is no gory violence here; it is almost suitable for children to watch except for some vulgar language.  It is a comedy -- understand that and you won't be disappointed.<br />There is no booklet enclosed with this package, only a Chapter List.  I really enjoyed this one and will probably watch it again prior to observing my other two \\"Evil Dead\\" movies.
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic was perhaps one of the greatest pieces of music in the history of hip-hop. As you listen to rap you can feel the pain and thoughtfullness in each of his rhymes. Though short compared to rap present 15 to 18 songs. Illmatic proved in 10 songs(really nine because the first is a brief intro) Quaility over Quanity  songs like the insightful &quot;New York State of Mind&quot; Nas gives a glimpse of ghetto life through a perspective that is not explored often through the eyes of a observant child and eventual manhood.Also the Pete Rock produced the &quot;World is Yours&quot; is another thought provoking musical gem that features Nas intricate flow matched with the trademark Pete Rock jazzy beat.Also Nas shines on &quot;Halftime&quot;, &quot;It ain't Hard to tell&quot; Overall this is Nas best piece of work and masterpiece that all music lovers can appreciate.

As the Jackdaws are united, their varied habits and personalities are as captivating as the plot.

Ken Follett's talent shines through page after page, making &quot;Jackdaws&quot; a must for avid readers.  Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge
B000002WU9|4.0|This was not a bad CD by any means, however, by all the hype saying this is the best wu tang solo disc ever, I was expecting much more. The first half of the album definetly sounds like a 5 star CD, however the second half is not. The best tracks on this cd are &quot;Knuckleheadz&quot;, &quot;Criminology&quot;, &quot;Incarcerated Scaarfaces&quot;, and &quot;Guillotine (swordz)&quot; (especially Inspectah Deck's verse). Those are really the only tracks that stood out to me. There are no bad tracks on this cd, there just aren't enough great ones for a 5 star rating. This is definetly not the best wu tang solo release, but if you already have &quot;Ironman&quot; by Ghostface Killah, &quot;Tical&quot; by Method Man, and &quot;liquid Swords&quot; by the GZA/Genius, and you want another good wu tang cd, then pick this up because it is better then any of the recent stuff they have put out. All in all a solid release by Raekwon.
B00005OAIE|4.0|If you like rhythm and enjoy nice melodies, then grab this album. While it may not be for cranking up on a Saturday night, it fits very nicely into most other nights of the week. Who analyzes lyrics like this reviewer anyway? Let him try the latest REM album...The jazz influences are great - and we should encourage more artists like Mayer as well as Pete Yorn. Not tear them down because they don't fit some mold.
B000001EUR|5.0|With the possible exception of &quot;Blackout&quot;, &quot;Love at First Sting&quot; has to be the Scorpions best effort to date. Even the songs that aren't &quot;big radio hits&quot; are excellent, including &quot;Bad Boys Running Wild&quot;, &quot;Coming Home&quot;, &quot;Crossfire&quot;, &quot;I'm Leaving You&quot;, etc.
B00004I9VE|5.0|When I bought this album in November of 1982, I sensed that it was a good album, but I didn't think that it would be a blockbuster. Every song on this album should have been realeased as a single. Michael Jackson saved the music industry and pumped up the video industry. This is a must own album
B00005QGAX|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite CDs of his, I grew up with it.  It's really great, but you really only want to listen to the interviews once.  If I could find this cd without the 'bonus' interviews, I'd rather have that one.  It's a bit tedious to keep getting up to skip these boring tracks.  Otherwise, BAD is continually in my sterio!
B000002U82|5.0|Major accomplishment by England's rock aristocrats. Speak To Me/Breathe In The Air, Time, Money, Us And Them, Brain Damage and Eclipse certainly are the most significant tracks from this album. Because they already have been praised by other reviewers, I'll prevent overexposure to their greatness and better let them be enjoyed on reader/fans' stereo systems like they were meant for. Alternatively, I'll put focus this time on the arrangements I believe not quite up to Floyd scratch. Apparently, from what I have researched about this album, they remain the songs that after first written/composed were not initially going to be taken to the recording studio. However, because of band perseverance, the production team itself became more enthusiastic and chose ultimately to have them included. This turned out very good judgment on the part of Capitol as listeners in the end were able to experience some added (not refined however as next mentioned) band character instead of tedious extended play time.<BR> <BR>   No disrespect whatsoever to Gilmour/Waters back then in the `70's for their efforts/ingenuity, although On The Run in today's technology world I'm sure could be composed by almost any data buff even half `in tune` with sounds reproduction. The Great Gig In The Sky is rewarding especially with the Negro soul yet ultimately I think becomes repetitive/overworked. Any Colour You Like is acceptable but does not come anywhere near in comparison to beginning acclaimed tracks. I am aware these cuts are the ones off the album that did not include lyrics but that was not why they weren't chosen in particular. Pink Floyd has recorded great instrumentals on other selections (One Of These Days from Meddle - 1971 an excellent example) that definitely were superior to those sung along with but Dark Side of the Moon is not among their grade or class. Apart from the few songs described, an all-round Rock phenomena is what this disc represents and with continued fan support/interestthat I'm confident is how it will stay...
078322947X|5.0|Roy Scheider plays a Mafia gang member who participates in a botched hold-up of a rival crew's operation. As the getaway car crashes, Scheider's character, forced to abandon the money, is left to escape the police who are fast closing in. This is how \\"Sorecerer\\" opens - at a point where you'd think less ambitious movies would usually end. Scheider, now hunted by the Mob and the law, and with time running out, accepts a hurriedly arranged escape-plan to flee the country that's fraught with unanswered questions. From this point on, every step he takes, however expedient or desperate, to extricate himself from his dire circumstances, takes him deeper into a nightmarish world where events are ever-increasingly beyond his control - all the way up to a shattering, surreal conclusion. I hadn't seen \\"Wages Of Fear\\" before this movie, but \\"Sorcerer\\" left a tremendous impression on me. It's as convincing as any \\"descent-into-hell\\" picture I've ever seen, like \\"Apocolypse Now\\", \\"Deliverance\\" or \\"Angel Heart\\". Friedkin's universe here is devoid of heroes - everyone is a villain. And trust is viewed with suspicion, even when it's a matter of survival.<br />The acting is convincing and, yes, I even like the directing. The script, what there is, is good and the score is phenominal, but, it's really about how they (along with the various plotlines) all converge to create such a singularly gritty, horrifically surreal and numbingly Noir-ish universe - the sheer force of which is a little hard to shake off, even after it's over. In fact, one critic called it: \\"The toughest, most relentless American film in a long time\\". Other critics panned it as some sort of monumental directorial failure, but personally, I actually enjoy it when a filmmaker makes demands on my attention span. If it's a failure, then it's one of my favorite kinds.<br />The union of film and music in this movie is outstanding. Almost unbelievably, Friedkin, paying homage to Tangerine Dream, writes in the liner notesfor the CD: \\"One day in the middle of a primeval forest in the Dominican Republic, about six months into the shooting, a tape arrived from The Dream, containing ninety minutes of musical impressions. It is from this tape that the film is scored, though the musicians had not then nor even now as this is written seen any of the footage\\". I can only ponder the degree to which the music must have impacted the remaining production and post-production, but I can't imagine the synergy of this film/music combo having been improved upon.<br />According to at least one source, this film was shot in Panavision. That scope is always 2.35:1. And from looking at the compositions on the full-frame DVD, I'd say that's a safe bet. It's true that Friedkin dictated the laserdisc to be pan&scan. I suppose that he may have felt, on the small screen anyway, that facial expressions were more important than vistas in this film, but, that's just my speculation. Maybe it was done for art-direction concerns, I dunno. Even so, things have changed since the original LD release and video display devices (mine among them) have increased in size and resolution steadily over the years and I (the above art-direction concerns notwithstanding) would jump at the chance to own an anamorphic DVD of this unforgettable movie.
B00005Y228|5.0|This album has a great sound. I found myself dancing to the whole thing!!!
0060392886|5.0|This book was such an honest and eye opening look into the lives of one of the biggest metal rock bands. It was a real page turner and I didn't want to put it down. Neil Strauss has done an amazing job of putting it all together and the boys did an excellent job of telling the tale of their crazy lives, which to them seemed normal.  It's all you ever wanted to know (and some stuff you can't even imagine) about the life of bad boy rockers and their triumphs and downfalls. I would totally recommend this book to anyone, whether a Crue fan or not, because I enjoyed it soooooo much! I really hope that these boys put out another one about their lives after the book was published, and that Neil Strauss will hopefully write for more bands! Excellent buy! It'll blow you away!
B00003CWN3|1.0|This movie has a big lie at its center...here it is in summary:  Teena Brandon was murdered because she used and deceived people - those people themselves being fellow criminals who were in and out of prison thus being a dangerous bunch in the first place - and she got caught and killed by them.  It had little to do with the fact that she was a woman pretending to be a man.  This movie tries to get you to believe the lie that she was murdered for her gender confusion, and thus it was a hate crime like the one Matthew Shepard was victim of, and not the truth that she was pretty much a criminal herself who got offed by fellow prison parolees, which though tragic is simply not the same kind of crime. <br />As a movie it's merely OK with a few dry patches, though the director shows a lot of talent.  I think she (the director) was limited by a mediocre script and a deeply flawed premise (see above).  I look forward to her future work.<br />My only other quibble with this movie is they clearly have a toddler in a scene where graphic violence is filmed.  If we protect our animals from harm while using them to make a movie (as we should), how is it that we allow a movie crew to terrorize a tiny baby just to get a shot?
B00005JKQX|4.0|I loved this film. Russell Crowe was great! This is one of the best films of the year. The performances were out of this world! Ron Howard proves that he has grown up, and moved on to bigger things. This was a great film, with a great message about a disorder that is so hard for so many people around the world. Go see it, and be moved.<br />The only problem that I had with this film was that the whole time that Crowe's character was seeing things, NOT ONCE did he see a Smurf. If he had seen atleast a few of them, the impact of the film would have been greater!<br />Aside from that, go see this marvelous film from Dreamworks!
B000063CPL|5.0|Where to begin? With the fact that this is the greatest selection of songs, by the greatest band? Or that there has never been an album recorded showing soo much emotion and raw energy? Or to coment on the fact that Maiden once again produce a live album that shows how amazing they are on stage? Not forgeting the interaction between band members and the crowd!<BR>Finaly buy it! I am not exagerating... this is awsome, even those who criticise Maidens sound, style and particularly those shallow [people] who winge about their image have given this album ace reviews! Simply put ... THIS SHREDS!!! Up the Irons
0380788624|3.0|hitherto a die-hard fan of Stephenson's books, it was pure<BR>pleasure to see this tome - on the shelves when I worked in<BR>a bookshop, and after some anticipation to be able to read it.<BR>Not underestimating NS talents, fed as I was on the back<BR>catalogue: Snow Crash (alltime favourite), Diamond Age (superb),<BR>Zodiac (colourful) - so I didn't react to the <BR>treatment of women (as the above reviewer noted) immediately.<BR>This book is worth reading, and if NS can get over this<BR>anomaly in his writing career, he may be able to retain more<BR>of his readership.  But, come the last fifth of the book,<BR>with the patronising treatment of cardboard-cutout women/girls,<BR>and the elevation of men to some unrealistic self-sufficient<BR>plane (a la the whole warehouse, dungeons dragons, boys n toys<BR>scenes), I was wondering what had affected my favourite sci-fi<BR>writer (with reservations).  Going so far as to read some<BR>supplementary biographies of Turing, and simultaneously<BR>reading a few pop math books, I wondered where these <BR>atavistic impulses that led Stephenson to write out women<BR>from the book came from, and also, I wondered how a book<BR>that in a logical progression, should have been brilliant,<BR>was missing something so particular (to get off the female<BR>slant), which for all its irony and ours, we might remember<BR>as being soul.

B00004Y6NW|5.0|Having heard several of the cuts on this album previously, I was thrilled to find that the cuts that I hadn't heard were very exceptional. Mr. Knopfler's voice and guitar convey the message that the song is sending its listener...almost on every cut.  Being an avid fan, one can hardly step back and judge the artist and group from an objective viewpoint, you say?  Not so with me, I know what I like and don't like in music, regardless of the artist.  Mr. Knopfler has the rare gift of storytelling and fantastic guitar work that can hardly be compared with others in the era.  I could name off the cuts that jumped right out at me; but, they would jump right out at any listener who is listening with an objective ear.  I have followed the man and his group for years and have found that the man, Mark Knopfler, has not lost his touch.  Though, he does not have the fantastic voice of Sting or Elton John...he has a presence much like Kris Kristofferson...no one could sing the songs the way he does; he puts his own signature on it so you know that it is HIS song.  He is the epitomy of the songwriter...bravo, Mr. Knopfler!
B00005JKQX|5.0|I wanted to see this movie from the first time I saw a trailer for it. (And not just because of the delightful Russell Crowe, either!) I'm glad that I made the trip -- twice -- to see this incredibly informative, enlightening and well-documented journey of one man's trip through the world of mental illness. <br />The thing that I believe struck me the strongest when I walked out of that theater was this: I had been inside the head of a man (John Nash) who has this illness, and didn't even know it until well into the film! The first half (or so) of this movie was shot from nearly a first person viewpoint, but was done so skillfully that the viewer isn't even aware of it. At first, I was a little annoyed to see that my first perceptions of the storyline were wrong. Then I started to see a little glimmer of understanding. Soon, that glimmer was a full-blown light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel understanding. That was the whole point. To see the world as someone with that kind of illness sees it. Not to feel sorry for that person, not to even really empathize with them, but to truly BE them. <br /> I WAS John Nash for the first portion of this film, I think I now have a clearer, more defined understanding, and for that, I'm grateful.Wonderful movie, which truly deserves the Oscars that it won.

0679731725|5.0|Kazuo Ishiguro's writing in &quot;Remains&quot; is as near to perfection as I think it is possible for an author to come.  Stevens, the detached-yet-not-so-detached English butler, deserves a place among literature's greatest first-person narrators; it is impossible not to be moved by his enduring loyalty, his quiet but desperate need to justify his employer's actions, his inability to shed the code of gentility bred into him by his father and by his unique social position, and his longing to always do and say and think and feel the &quot;right thing.&quot;  It is Ishiguro's flawless writing that makes all of this come through clearly, cleanly, and without the need for literary bells and whistles.  &quot;Remains&quot; is the epitome of &quot;restrained&quot; writing and the plot--which weaves in and out of time, as Stevens dissembles and eventually faces the truth about himself and his past--is magnificent.  Needless to say, I highly recommend this book.
B00003CY5J|2.0|Although the performances of both Edward Norton and Robert De Niro where great. The film did not deliver what you'd expect from a movie combining De Niro with Norton.<BR>The fact that De Niro and Norton gave great performances is something to be expected at this point in time. So we shouldn't be surprised that they did. We also expect them to be picky about what roles they will take. <BR>My opinion was that the film left me feeling very very deissapointed.
B00003CXI1|5.0|i am from England and so i am very protective of any film made in England. I have seen both versions of the film \\"Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone\\"(the title JK Rowling gave it) and \\"Harry Potter and the Sourcers stone\\". I thought they were both excellent and throughly deserved all the amazing reviews it was given. I will be queuing to get the video when it is released on May 11th (English release date) and will be standing in line to see \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" when that is released on november 16th. I feel very proud that Britian has a last produced a great film for children and adults alike.
0446678430|5.0|This book is one of Kiyosaki's best.  \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" opens your mind to something never discussed before but seems so obvious.  \\"Cashflow Quadrant\\" helps explain the way that Kiyosaki views the world; but \\"Retire Young Retire Rich\\" is the best book yet.  All the poor reviews I've read so far have either attacked his writing as a person or have attacked the lack of concrete evidence of numbers.  In every book so far he has said that he will not give the concrete numbers but will show you how to open your mind.  So many people believe that they have an open mind but it's merely vacant.  He doesn't offer a plan to get rich but the way he was thinking in order to become fabulously wealthy.  In the beginning it talks about expanding your context so that it can except more content.  Saying I can't do that or it can't be done is having a fools context.  I'm only 21 and have invested in stocks, and I am about to close on my first real estate investment as a college student.  The younger minds are much more free to the beauty of such thinking.  If you're looking for other books to read Kiyosaki does offer many books besides his own at the end of \\"Cashflow Quadrant\\"  If you'll notice throughout \\"Retire Young Retire Rich\\" he mentions his plan of buying two homes every year for the next ten years.  That planning in my personal belief came from a prior book written in the early 80's called \\"Creating Wealth\\" by Robert G Allen.  He also mentions \\"How to Make Money in Stocks\\" by William J Oneil.  These are all fabulous books to read.  So to all the bad reviewers who found no value to this book, your context is too small to except the content that this book is giving you.  The wealth of information is immeasureable.  I also own Cashflow 101 the game and have played with numerous other people and have seen the difference in the way people trully think.  The five Rich Dad series books are wonderful and provide insight to the next.  The game is expensive but I have found the truefountain of youth in my mind.  Thank You Robert.
0385335482|5.0|This book is right along the lines of the all the British comedy books coming out following the success of Briget Jones' Diary.  It's funny, fluffy, fun, romantic and absolutely right on.  It seems as though the author has  been in my head so much that I was ashamed of my own shopping habits reading this book.  It's an easy read and tons of fun!  Saving time from having to write a review for the second one, Takes Manhattan is just as wonderful, if not a better read.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg provides Americans a view of what Civil War troops faced in battle. I show this film to every class I teach. Students love it. It helps show the debt that has been paid for our freedom today.
0767817478|4.0|The movie is great and it is really good to see another point of view for godzilla (American) instead of the traditional Japanese.  I am a big Godzilla fan andI think that this is a most for any fan.  As for the others who are not femiliar with the title, I think that this movie will give them a nice experience especially cause it is suitable for most of the family members.  Action, good story, superb acting, perfect SFX, and ofcourse Godzilla.  Finally, the DVD got 4 because it should be loaded with extras or at least double DVD set.  and that is why and only why it got 4.
0425180638|3.0|The good point to this story is that it ties up some of the questions raised previously in the series.<br />If you haven't read The Black Notice, read it before this one.  The entire story of that book is almost completely retold in this one.  There are more subplots going on in this one than Cornwell has ever had before, but unfortunately the main plot is revolves around her previous book.<br />The writing is typical Cornwell.  If you like the rest of the series, you'll probabaly like this one, but I just couldn't get into it.
B00000ICD9|3.0|The movie plays out like an ode to Dante, finding Robin Williams reaching to the depths of hell to find his wife after she commits suicide.  A couple things really grabbed me about this movie.  One thing was Robin Williams performance and his growing depth as an actor.  In the beginning, before he dies, he is visibally a scarred, emotionally conflicted person because of his childrens' deaths.  He plays the character with such warmth and down to earth sadness that is almost unmatched.  It's clearly a result of award winning work on Good Will Hunting.<br />The second thing that grabbed was the undeniably beautiful visuals.  They almost play with the senses by showing us the beauty of heaven in what's probably the best description ever captured on screen.  Then, we're taken on a journey through hell.  It's unspeakably dark and unspeakably sad.  I was moved as Robin Williams went through the pit of all the condemned people and then as he confronted his wife.  The scenes are dar, emotional, and disturbing.<br />The movie's only deterrents I think come from the ending.  I wasn't really moved by the ending.  Two endings are offered on this disc and the one that they went with is the superior one while the alternate ending seemed to be too dramatic and too sad.  I guess from a theological perspective, however, the ending that was used didn't work for me.  You didn't know whether to feel happy or sad and you didn't feel that it was the right way for things to end.  It felt forced and a bit uninspired where the rest of the film was drenched in emotional energy.<br />Despite it's shortcomings, however, Robing Williams's performance, the amazing visuals, and depth of emotion create a pretty compelling and original piece of work.
6301607929|4.0|The first interest of this film is the nostalgia it represents for all Americans who remember Labor Day as the last day of the summer, of the vacation, a day of celebration and joy. Here it is the scene of a big picnic organized by the Chamber of Commerce with all kinds of activities and competitions : pie-eating, three leg running, dancing, the election of a queen, trained seals, etc. But the main interest of the film is the impact this Labor Day has on the five women living in two houses. It is a time of liberation and finally realizing their dreams. An old lady just enjoys the nostalgia. A mother is confronted to the free choices of her two daughters. One daughter decides to break off with her official boyfriend and to run away with another. A school teacher gets drunk and finds the courage to force her manfriend into marrying her. It becomes a day of emancipation, a day when one must follow one's instinct and not one's duty.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B00005YTFG|5.0|Morons.<br />Anyways, I'm noticing that the bad reviews generally have little to say apart from mindless griping, while the positive reviews can point to many aspects of the movie that they loved.  It seemed the point is that bad reviewers seem to dislike the movie either a) Because everyone else LIKED it or b) Because it didn't fit snugly into a cookie-cutter Hollywood movie that is generally put out (and is easy to digest)<br />No, this movie does not really have a plot, nor does it use original lyrics for the songs (the score and re-orchestrations, however, are all original).  What the negative reviewers don't tell you in their whining, is that the director and composer, through the orchestration, create incredible musical continuity throughout the entire show (bordering on leitmotifs - something negative reviewers seem to know nothing about).  Thus, this show, in spite of being erratic on screen, has inherent in it tremendous continuity and smoothness.<br />Second, the movie is not really supposed to be about the plot.  It's instead more like seing a portrait, or listening to a non-programmatic symphony.  The movie is a movie for its own sake.  Yes, it is a meditation on love, but did anybody REALLY care about the plot?  That's not a bad thing, but no.  This movie is special and incredible because it barrages one's senses in a turn-of-the-century cabaret style show.  You almost want to clap when Nicole Kidman is done singing.<br />Furthermore, the acting is great.  Kidman, McGregor, and company all put on marvelous performances (Halle Berry won?  What the hell?).  The most underrated part is that of the Duke, beautifully carried out.<br />Anyways, buy it and love it.  If you don't, then you are watching it with the wrong intentions in mind.  If you still don't love it, at least come up with convincing arguments for why not (and learn to spell, unlike many of them).
B00003CXDG|5.0|I love the action/adventure genre and this is one of the best. This movie is good enough to watch more than once and is a must own movie.
B00005RFAI|2.0|I must say I was feeling the first album, &quot;Can't Take me Home&quot; however, maybe she flipped the script a little too much too soon with this second go'round.  Don't get me wrong, I really like Pink, just the old Pink.  I don't know the reason behind the change but perhaps there is a lesson to be learned:  Change isn't always a good thing.  There are some tracks that are enjoyable on the album but the first album I could listen the whole way through and like every track.  Not this time.  If you are an R&amp;B fan, this really isn't that type of album.  Maybe she'll go back to the original her on the next one.  The only change I like was her look.  She looks really good.  She seems undecided on what music category she wants to be in.  The title suits the album, because I sure &quot;Missundaztood&quot; what she was about.  Come on Pink, you had a good thing going, don't mess it up now!
B00005JKED|1.0|Dislike is too weak to express my feelings.  I bought the movie after seeing reviews and absolutely hated this movie. The action parts seemed contrived.  The characters so flawed that no one was likeable.  I didn't even like Ethan Hawke's character.  He was so weak in the beginning of the movie that his sudden change to a &quot;man of character&quot; didn't work for me.  I just got the feeling that the director and cast decided to experiment with a new genre and it didn't work out.
B00000IONU|5.0|First off - all the other reviews in this section will not give you any clue to what this album is all about. This album is about 55 minutes long. It's about the size of a bath tile. And it's just ..... about! (mostly in your shops or local market place).<BR>If you need to be told whether or not to buy this album then I recommend that you buy it, then you can slag it off like some of the people in this section who were hoping for the &quot;new Strokes&quot; or something. PLEASE HELP MAKE MEG AND JACK GET RICH QUICK! Buy the album! IT'S APPROX 55 MINS LONG DON'T YA KNOW!

B00005QXDD|5.0|I'd have never thought that I'd love a hard-rock-satire album so much, but I've been listening to the Tenacious D CD every day since it arrived.  It's just too funny to put down.  It's as if a big bombastic metal band suddenly got a self-deprecating sense of humor and made an album that parodies rock conventions.  In reality it's the brainchild of Jack Black (the rude clerk from &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and other flicks) and Kyle Gass, and they do a great job of making Spinal-Tappy rock songs.  In between the songs are some little skits between the two band members that are good but aren't necessary to hear repeatedly; the songs themselves though are abundantly silly and catchy and rockin' and worth repeat listens.<br />Aside from Spinal Tap, Tenacious D also reminds me a little of the cheesy ballads that Dirk Diggler and Chest Rockwell made in &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, but even much more over-the-top and tongue-in-cheek.  The album is really profane, but it's all for humorous effect and works well -- just be warned.  I'd print some lyrics here but they'd be all *'d out and I wouldn't want to spoil them for you anyway.  The music holds up surprisingly well too -- these guys clearly have listened to a lot of hard rock and assimilated bits and pieces of different influences to make songs that sound good even aside from the funny lyrics.<br />It's hard to describe why I dig this CD so much ... I guess it's just the combination of self-aware silliness with rocking really hard that hits the spot.  These guys really know how to make a fun album.  Now pardon me while I go search for my socks ...
078062369X|2.0|\\"Blade\\", the adaptation of the graphic comic about the world's most badass vampire slayer, manages to be both bloodless and brainless at the same time.  I've sat through this flick several times wondering what the producers thought they were looking at when they put it together.  In the flick, Wesley Snipes plays \\"Blade\\" a sort of hybrid between vampire (he calls them \\"sucker heads\\") and human - born when his mother is violated by the evil vampire Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorf).  As you can imagine, Blade isn't very keen on vampires, and he goes through this flick annihilating them in gross using machine gun and samurai sword.  While the vampires are all evil, most are just rich guys in suits with nothing more against the human race than merely being on top of us on the food chain, going about their un-dead lives conquering the financial and political world when they're not going for somebody's jugular.  Frost has his own plans, but they require getting his hands on a few pints of Blade's blood.  Seems that being a half-breed vampire has more of an upside than you'd think - with Blade being able to walk under the sun that kills other vampires.  (Crosses and other religious stuff are harmless against vampires - that's just superstition; garlic, wooden stakes, silver and sunlight, however, remain as lethal as we'd been led to believe)  Blade's blood is the key to elevating the race of vampires above its weaknesses, raising them to be gods.<br />Not entirely an original plot, but \\"Blade\\" could have worked.  The action sequences could have worked, but they're unintelligible beyond seeing Blade dance around while dispatching scores of vampire soldiers.  Though the flick takes its cue from HK action movies, they lack the poetry of \\"Crouching Tiger\\" \\"The Matrix\\" or even \\"Charlie's Angels\\".  There's no irony, just flying feet and a samurai sword with a self-adjusting handle that somehow manages to save the day.  The special effects aren't anything special either - just expensive CGI and obvious CGI at that.  For a movie about vampires, computer animated blood is just no substitute.  The flick tosses in a mysterious serum that turns vampires into bombs, but that's just more CGI.  The problem is that Wesly Snipes could have saved this flick but, with his sunglasses he's something of an undead character himself, and he spends more time on those killer moves than on making Blade anything more than some killer android in Ray Bans.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character, a suburban teenager who has it all. Rich parents, a beautiful home, an exclusive private school where the students openly do cocaine in the halls, Drew Barrymore as an English professor and a $200 an hour analyst. In the movies, such a privileged, complacent milieu is bound to weather some unsettling moments, and Donnie soon meets up with a mysterious benefactor -- a six-foot tall man in a bunny costume with a skull face named \\"Frank.\\" Frank comes to Donnie in a dream state, and saves him from a freak accident. Such a favor can't go unpaid, and soon \\"Frank\\" has Donnie running errands -- and the mystery deepens.<br />Surrealistic and dream-like, \\"Donnie Darko\\" weaves in a lot of elements that intentionally don't all add up. Time travel, teen angst, apocalyptic visions, madness, budding sexuality and eye-popping special effects find their way into this tantalizing rabbit stew. Set in 1988, the soundtrack offers sing-along favorites such as Tears for Fears \\"Head Over Heels\\" and \\"Mad World\\" along with hairstyles that will make many older audience members cringe in recognition. In addition, Patrick Swayze plays a motivational speaker who spouts mixture of Reagan conservatism and Nietzchean ruthlessness. Like most everybody else in the movie, he harbors a very, very dark secret.<br />\\"Donnie Darko\\" wears a lot pop culture references on its sleeve. Even the least astute will pick up on the references to \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"Harvey\\" this cursory summary mentions. Eagle-eyed viewers will spot the sly nods to Swayze's \\"Footloose\\" and have a good chuckle over the very unlikely double feature of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead playing with Martin Scorsese's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" playing at a near-empty theater!<br />\\"Darko\\" is a visually compelling feast for the senses. If not everything about it makes sense, well, it's probably not supposed to -- \\"Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?\\"<br />-- Greg Goodsell
B00003OSTQ|5.0|The film itself illustrates how the pursuit of ratings (intern ad revenue) greatly influences how far a company can go.<br />The acting in the film is outright superb. You don't find films made like this anymore.<br />What I would like to see would be and updated version of it with Matt Drudge (if you're reading) to play Peter Finch!<br />This one is one of the few films I'll buy instead of just renting
B0000634EV|5.0|Absolutely NO disappointments here.  A supergroup of the highest order that actually lives up to expectations (and exceeds them).  The power of the riff definitely compels them (my neck is still sore).  This stuff is as dynamic as anything I've ever heard.  I'm not easily pleased usually but I could go on and on and on about the quality of content and production on this one.  Look for 'em on a fairly extensive tour this year.

0930289234|5.0|This is the greatest comic ever written and for good reason.  It takes place in the \\"real\\" world, during the mid eighties.  This story looks at the charector behind the mask, what makes that person tick, and how they got in the costume.  The story starts off simple, a murder, and evolves into something that effects the fate of the world.  A good portion of the story takes place in flashbacks, and shows how much effort and thought went into this story and how everything is connected together.  Another thing about this story is that it doesnt give away anything early, like in most comics, we find out when the charectors do. And in the end when you are done you will realize why this the greated comics ever writtten.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I've never been a Moby fan, and I was really reluctant to buy this album.  I had bought Everything Is Wrong, mostly because I liked the album title, and even though it was pretty great in some ways, the schizophrenia of it put me off quite a bit.  So I was pretty surprized at how thoroughly coherent Play is, especially when it contains songs as seemingly incompatable as Bodyrock (which sounds very Fatboy-Slim influenced) and Porcelin, the complete opposite.  But it all works, somehow, combining sampled Gospel vocals and electronica to create a whole new musical genre.<br />Doesn't Moby come up with some great song titles?  Check 'em out.  Another plus is how even though he's a very devout Christian and vegan, he doesn't feel the need to preach about it in his music.  Instead, he puts essays of his into the liner notes, and even though I don't agree with his politics, he makes some very valid points in his essays that I definately respect.<br />&quot;Find My Baby&quot; is probably my favorite song on here, although they're all good.  Some are really techno-y, but still original enough to escape the facelessness that plagues a lot of electronic music.  I think for this album Moby was really influenced by the Fatboy Slim/Chemical Brothers strategy of gradually building up songs by slowly piling on more and more instruments.  He took what they had already done, added some gospel samples, and took it to the max.  Also, unlike the Chemical Brothers for example, Moby has clearly spent a lot of time analyzing his song structures and making sure they never go on so long that they turn into a bunch of hammering, repetitive noise.  A lot of these songs start out very basic, maybe just a lone vocal or keyboard part, but once enough relatively simple instrument parts start piling up upon each other, the songs just gain this sense of epicness.  Great stuff.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This movie was a no brainer.  If you have no brain and plenty of time to waste then this movie is for you.  After reading who was in the cast and who was responsible for directing the film I expected to be entertained. Instead the audience was treated to a boring, unbelieveable farce. This film ia must to avoid.
B000002MY3|5.0|This CD is something else.  Alanis may have become a little (okay a lot) more self-indulgent on her more recent CD's, but this one was just 12 flawless pop songs that hold up perfectly under repeat listenings.  Every single one of them could have been a radio hit, but there really was no need for that since the 4 or 5 hits off this album were enough to make it one of the biggest selling records ever.  Not that that means anything, of course, usually big record sales is a sign of bad music.  But not here.  With this album she was onto something big.  If she would have continued to focus on the music instead of eschewing that for the lengthy, overindulgent lyrical style of later albums, who knows what she could have accomplished.  That's the one thing that makes this album so great: the intense, focused songwriting.  The rest is just a bonus, because its the pure catchiness of this album that'll make you keep coming back to it.  Its just packed full of melody; there's not a wasted note here, and yet the song structures are complex enough that you'll never get sick of them.  Its surprising how much Alanis can make songs composed of the most basic of instruments seem like something completely fresh and original.  Try and think of an artist who sounded anything like her prior to 1995.  I dare you.<br />Its hardly the most critically acclaimed album, and owning it will probably lower everybody's opinion of your musical tastes.  But who cares.  I can't point out a single thing I dislike about the album, and that's saying something.  It reminds me a lot of Pearl Jam's 1st album in the way that its completely melodic the whole way through, and in points very intensely emotional.  In fact, every song on this album has some seriously intense, emotional Alanis stuff going on.  It really lets you look in on what she's thinking, and you can't help but agree with her as she puts down her ex-lovers, parents, ect.  And its not all angry stuff, either, with songs like Head Over Feetand You Learn.<br />Not to mention her voice, which is probably the most instantly recognizable voice in music with the power to cut through anything. Buy it, you won't be able to help but like it.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|Nice gimmick, but lousy story.  The director is in love with the way he's telling this mediocre story and that sustains the movie for the first thirty minutes, but then tedium sets in.  I'm glad he tried so hard to do something different, and that may make the movie worth seeing (ok, it's worth seeing briefly for being unique, but you'll get bored with it pretty quickly so have another movie handy to put in when this one starts putting you to sleep).  There is mild fun in trying to piece all the elements together, but once you do there isn't anything interesting going on.  People are giving this movie too much credit for telling its story from both the beginning and the end at the same time with an actual ending somewhere in the middle, and aren't giving it enough criticism for being just a simple minded and uninteresting story to begin with.
B00005RYL9|5.0|I just got my hands on an advanced copy of the new Highlander Immortal Edition DVD. I have heard how horrible the picture quality was on the first DVD was, and so I was hesitant on watching this one. When it was all said and done, I sat there in amazement. The DVD picture quality was AMAZING!!! It looks as if they filmed the movie yesterday, and not 17 years ago. The sound is awesome and overall I would say that this is the definitive version of the movie. The only thing the lacks are the extras, but the movie more that makes up for it.
B000002GQE|5.0|I love all of the Moody Blues work, but, this album holds a special place in my heart. This album alone is what turned me on to classical music. I had no idea until I heard &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; just how wonderful orchestral music is. This is a beautiful mix of classic rock and classical music. From &quot;The Day Begins&quot;, to &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot;, 'Days Of Future Passed&quot; is a Remastered Masterpiece. If you are a beginning collector of Moody Blues music, this is the cd you should start with. This was the first in my collection and, I was hooked!! You will be too.
0930289234|4.0|I read Watchmen back when it first came out, and have been an avid fan ever since. However, I hadn't read the graphic novel in years, and upon re-reading it recently, I was struck by how dated it seems.<br />Yes, it's still fundamentally excellent graphically and in terms of characterization, but it no longer seems as mind-blowing as it did back in 1986. Super-hero comics are still full of the same Good-Guy-Beats-Up-Bad-Guy stuff that they've always had, just with different artists and costumes. The depth of super-hero comics certainly hasn't increased; if anything, it may have regressed since the late '80s.<br />In retrospect, one reason why Watchmen provided such exhilaration back in the day was because of the comic book's physical appearance. For the most part, comics before the mid-80s didn't look like Watchmen, with the then-fancy paper, the high production values, the ancillary material in the back of each issue, and the covers that looked like someone actually put thought into the design, rather than just slapping together something that looked, well, like a comic book.<br />Sad to say, as with the plots, the graphic designs and layouts of comics have retreated to their garish days.<br />On a broader scale, Watchmen's plot really reeks of the kind of Cold War thinking that turned out to be wildly wrong. And Alan Moore's black-and-white political speculation seems naive at best and laughable at worst, although there's still a good deal of validity to his overall views of the kind of sociological impact that a Dr. Manhattan would have.<br />Perhaps the most regrettable part of Watchmen is the ending. Several observers (including Sam Hamm, who wrote the screenplay for Tim Burton's Batman and the original Hollywood treatment for a Watchmen movie that never got beyond the planning stages) have pointed out that the only way the Bad Guy's plan would actually work is if he redid it in a different city every six months.<br />If you think otherwise, look no further than the World Trade Center attack--the world was gushing with Unity And The Fight Against Terrorism for about, oh, two months or so. Now the world is back to criticizing almost every move America makes.<br />Granted, Watchmen's climax is on a much larger scale than the WTC (which was terrible enough, don't get me wrong), but ultimately, you'd still have the same reaction. Yes, the world would tremble for maybe a year, but then people would get back to their old ways; it's too implausible to expect people and nations of the world to abandon their ways almost overnight. Even the destruction of a major city, in and of itself, could not possibly overthrow all of human history preceding it.<br />Perhaps the best example would be the biggest catastrophe in human history, World War II. You would think that a conflict that ruined two continents and a significant chunk of a third might cause people to think about world peace and unity. And they tried, which is why we have the United Nations. Unfortunately, the good feeling didn't last long, did it? The world is as conflict-ridden now as it was in 1939, perhaps moreso. And if World War II couldn't do it, it seems highly unlikely that Our Villain's &quot;masterstroke&quot; would be any more effective.
0446677450|2.0|I bought the CD version of the book.  Overall, it was disappointing.  Too many cliches.  Too redundant.  Parts of stories and examples did not seem to tie together.  He made it seem like it was noble to go bankrupt and sleep in a car.  However, it was not fully explained how he went bankrupt in the first place.  If he had been following his &quot;Rich Dad's&quot; advice since he was 9 years old, what happened?  I started to replay the CD to gather examples of the excessive use of cliches, but decided it was not worth my time to listen to the CD again.  To be fair, I have been told that the book is better than the CD.  Maybe the CD left out some parts that would have made the book worth reading.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Well, you might like or not like this movie, but not a single person can watch it and pretend that it did not strike something deep inside.  It is one of the strongest movies i have seen,  and it made me feel things no other movie has made me feel.  I strongly recommend it, as well as the book.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Let me say this now:  if you REMOTELY enjoyed watching the Goonies, this DVD is a MUST HAVE.  The extras include the music video by Cyndi Lauper, all the cut scenes, and a kickin commentary by the entire Goonie's cast!  This is by far the best DVD I own! (And I own a bunch, so that's saying a lot!)<br />BUY THIS NOW!
B00003CXRP|5.0|When I saw \\"Cast Away\\" in theaters back in the winter of 2000, I thought to myself on how brilliant the film was, and how brilliant the performance was from Academy-Award winner Tom Hanks (\\"Philadelphia\\", Best Actor, 1993). The filmmakers said that \\"Cast Away\\" was filmed in some parts of Memphis, TN, mostly at the FedEx complex, etc. This is pretty much the fourth film to be filmed in Memphis (the first three were John Grisham films based on his novels: \\"The Firm\\", \\"The Client\\", and \\"The Rainmaker\\"). The film focuses on a FedEx systems engineer named Chuck Noland (Hanks), who is obsessed with his job in which he comments: \\"we live and we die by time\\". Chuck has a beautiful life with his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt). When Chuck gets an unexpected call on his pager, he decides to take it. But after Chuck steps inside the airplane, it has engine trouble and crashes in the ocean. Chuck manages to survive the outcome of it and gets washed away to an island nearby. There he spends 4 years of his life fighting insanity by talking to a volleyball, in which he named \\"Wilson\\", and how he still manages to survive and figure out a way back home. Robert Zemeckis (\\"What Lies Beneath\\") directed this movie with lots of emotion and powerful storytelling as well. I purchased \\"Cast Away\\" in its 2-DVD set with lots of extras including behind-the-scenes footage, trailers, TV spots, commentaries, and more. But now, Fox Home Entertainment has re-released \\"Cast Away\\" again, this time as a one-disc treatment. And this time, you do not get all those extra goodies that are inside the 2-disc set, except for just commentaries, scene selection, and that's it. And, to me, that is just a cheap representation of the real thing (the 2-disc set). In other words, it's not good. But, all in all, this is Tom Hanks' best film since \\"Philadelphia\\", \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", and \\"The Green Mile\\". \\"Cast Away\\" is nothing short of being truly entertaining or emotional.
B000063USY|5.0|The fastest movie with the most beautiful cars I have seen for a long time.  The speed and cars are fantastic.  If you like speed and cars this is definately the movie for you.  I am going to buy the video because it's the type of movie I can watch over and over again.  The girls and guys in the movie are hmmmmm ...
B00005YW4H|5.0|She's a great new talent and her music fills a gap in the market for female vocalist/pianoist. Her voice is velvet smooth and crisp and her keyboard touch is light and delicate. If you found her playing in some smokey bar, you'd want to stay and sip bourbon all night with her.
0783243499|5.0|This is really quite an amusing movie. My favorite scenes were the axe-murder to the tune of \\"Hip To Be Square\\" by Huey Lewis and the News, and the business card scene. Truly hilarious.<br />The highlight of the film was Christian Bale's portrayal of Patrick Bateman- brilliant!!<br />If you thought the ending was insufficient, then you need to either watch the film again or read the book, because you're wrong. <br />All in all, brilliant dark humor.
6302101743|5.0|I REMEMBER SEEING THIS MOVIE WHEN IT WAS OUT IN A LOCAL THEATER! FANTASTIC STOP-MOIION PHOTOGRAPHY, GREAT WESTERN MUSICAL SCORE, ETC. AFTER WATCHING OLD GODZILLA MOVIES WHERE \\"MODERN WEAPONS\\" SAVE THE DAY, THE \\"COWBOYS\\" HAD TO USE ROPES, 6-SHOOTERS, RIFLES AND INGENUITY TO TAKE CARE OF THE THREAT! YES, SHADES OF KING KONG, SLOW-MOVING PLOT UNTIL THE \\"VALLEY\\" SCENES, ETC. THE ONLY OTHER MOVIE I RECALL THAT USED THE \\"COWBOY AGAINST DINOSAUR\\" PLOT WAS \\"BEAT OF HOLLOW MOUNTAIN\\" WITH GUY MADISON. GOOD PLOT BUT EXTREMELY POOR ANIMATION. GWANGI RULES!
B00005Y228|3.0|I'm not even going to lie to you. I bought the album because i've always thought that Kylie is one of the finest women walking on the planet. And listening to the album for the first time left a little to be desired. However, upon more recent spins of the disc, my conclusion has changed from indifference to a recomendation. To me, the album isn't the greatest dance album there is. But the single 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head' does nothing short of bump. Kylies lyrics have become more introspective while maintaining a pretty consitent level of musical production. I think its a keeper.
B0000640VO|5.0|this movie is the best movie i have ever seen!<BR>and being 17 in a small town, in this day and age, i have seen a lot of movies.<BR>this movie was really great because of all the colors that were used and the way the story was acted...thats too bad because when parents are gone all the time and girls dont like you because you look better than them( to some stupid boy) it is easy for me to get lost in a world of fantasy and escape my world of shallow california/american teens.<BR>YOU SHOULD SEE THIS ONE !!!!!!!!!
B00005JKED|2.0|Training day is an over the top violent movie that excedes credibility on all levels. I could not recommend this movie for its violent content,foul langauage and script absurdity. I have found denzel to be one of today's better actors and wished he had one the oscar for one of his past performances that he could be proud of.<br /> Though the movie is intense and carries with it heart pounding performances they are monotonal through out the movie with little to no depth of character. Shock value does not sustain a movie. So even though i am the minority here i can not recommend this movie--  go see Hurricane that was the oscar.
B00005Y228|3.0|After Kylie had proved everyone she could make interesting music in 1997, she went back to what her fans wanted: generic pop music. Which is fine also since she's good at doing that. 'Light Years' was a bit uneven but this one is a bit more creative and fun as a whole. The beats are better and this time around things dance a lot more. First of all, there's no ballad, which is a great way to make a dance record. Second, a few songs in here are truly landmark dance numbers: Can't Get You Out of My Head, Love Affair, Come To My World but mostly the amazing In Your Eyes. Burning Up is also a top-notch affair, being the most innovative track on the album. Some songs should have been left out (as they add nothing but filling) but that's to be expected from such a commercial release. Still a huge step over most candy-pop acts of today.
B00005JKQX|5.0|It is amazingly to see Russell plays well in the film Gladiator casting as a general. In this score again proves himself is a professional actor of all time.
B00000BKE0|2.0|When I first bought this album, I was immediately disappointed by a few key things:<BR>1. The absence of Adrian Smith and the presence of Janick Gers (not metal's worst guitarist, but hardly innovative or dyanmic)<BR>2. The flat, lacksluster production<BR>3. Some very uninspired songwriting<BR>That being said, I almost threw this CD in the garbage before getting to the 5th track.  However, I decided not to because it costed me [money] and was still a Maiden release.<BR>After a while, some of the songs clicked with me.  Tailgunner is an engaging tune, as well as Run Silent, Run Deep and Bring Your Daughter....To The Salughter, although none of them are as immediate or outward as Flight of Icarus or The Number of the Beast.  Additionally, some tracks are really embarrassing (The Assassin sounds like a parody of early Iron Maiden and Holy Smoke is a total farce), making the album sound uneven and uninspired.  And while I can usually tolerate lineup changes in most bands (take Zakk Wylde replacing Jake E. Lee in Ozzy Osbourne's band or Dickinson replacing Di'Anno in Maiden), Janick Gers is no match for Adrian Smith on guitar.  There was a lot of energy in Smith's playing, but none in Ger's.<BR>Overall, this an okay album for Maiden fans because it does have some decent material on it (though not enough).  If you are not a Maiden fan or are one but only like their older output, steer clear of this one.
B00005N9CV|2.0|Her vocal phrasing is really uninspired on these clasically-arranged songs. She uses the same husky breathy singing on ALL of the tracks and it all sounds too much like the same song over and over again. Its a shame really, because these are great songs. <br />Really, her vocal phrasing could only interesting if you haven't heard these songs ever before in your life.
B00005JKED|2.0|I was very disappointed by this movie. I was expecting big things out of it but I just couldn't see Denzel in the &quot;Bad guy&quot; role. I actually found myself laughing at times when it was supposed to be serious because it was so funny too see him acting like that. Also I thought that Ethan Hawke was horrible and it is a joke that he was even nominated for best supporting actor. If you want to see a performance where Denzel really shines then buy the Hurricaine or Malcom X
B000002MZ6|5.0|I picked this cd almost randomly out of a catalog, not knowing anything about the recording or the musician Mike Oldfield. But after giving it a few listens, I quickly realized that this is one of the better cds out of the hundreds I own! Aside from the very creative arrangements and fresh style of the music (which relies heavily on synthetic sounds and samples), one aspect of the music that I enjoy is what I perceive to be an interplay between very earthy or soulful sounds (such as tribal chants and distant voices) with more futuristic synthetic sounds. This duality seems to bring out from me an awareness of what is sacred here on earth, as well as what life could be like outside of our beautiful planet. And the fact that a piece of music could actually induce me to contemplate such things is worth 5 stars in and of itself!<br />Finally, if someone asked me to classify this music, I really wouldn't know how, other than to put it in the category of &quot;great music&quot;. In any case, I will be paying much closer attention to Mike Oldfield's music in the distant future.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem is one of the most talented rappers in the game. He has witty, funny, and unbelievably complex lyrics. I really believe that it comes down to him, Jay-Z, and Redman as the best emcees living. Em starts off with \\"Kill You\\" where he has a sick beat to support his sick flow. Other unbelievable songs are \\"Stan\\", the hilarious \\"Who Knew\\", the dark and disturbing \\"The Way I Am\\", \\"I'm Back\\", and \\"Marshall Mathers\\" (someone finally clowns ICP, thank you Em), \\"B Please 2\\" and \\"Criminal\\". This album displays that Eminem is hungery and is ferocious about his music and his rhymes. People could really learn from this talented cat.
0553812173|5.0|I've got about 100 pages left in this tome, but I simply couldn't wait to write my review.  I've read the best there is out there;  Jordan, Goodkind(don't know why everyone rates him as one of the best...), Modisett, and Martin, but none of these guys has anything on Erikson.  His world-building is impressive, plot keeps you glued, and most importantly, there are no GOOD/BAD guys.  Just people, like you and me.  Kinda scary actually.  Kinda reminded me of Martin in that aspect.  Think of Forgotten Realms, written by G.R.R. Martin, and you just about got it.  Without the dwarves and elves though, thank Oponn!!  Enough said, buy the book.  We gotta support this guy.  Make his publishers more interested in bringing his stuff over to North America.  Like a reviewer before me said, what's with the stealth release over here?  This guy makes Jordan look like Walt Disney...
6304144555|3.0|Its natural you feel you down to earth,natural feeling,rough and tough.
B00004SU5J|4.0|Don't hesitate, but just buy this CD. If you are in to the today's downbeat &amp; chill-out styles, if your background is jazz, this is a must have CD.
6305718954|3.0|I liked this movie for the acting, the cinematography, the dialog, and the editing. Unfortunately the plot had either serious holes in it, or it just wasn't very good. I have a hard time deciding which with this movie.<br />The plot involves a very compelling and interesting cover-up in the Vatican that provides a fascinating backdrop for what could be an equally interesting &quot;What if ancient miracles manifested themselves in modern America.&quot; The problem, it seems, is tying the two together. The explanations for the events given where either weak, or confusing. Why was an atheist afflicted with stigmata? What was the Vatican so desperate to cover up? Why was such a high level priest driven to such unchristian behavior? These questions are answered, but rather unconvincingly. I hope the plots introduced here are re-examined by a new film team, and given the deep examination they deserve. I would even like to see the same cast.
B000063CPL|5.0|First off, this gets 5 stars because it's Maiden. And they're the best band around, still, after all these years.<br />Now, I admit I was almost yawning at the thought of 'Yet Another Live Album'.  I mean, even Maiden Junkies like me can only have so many live renditions of the SAME OLD SONGS! <br />Alas, Rock In Rio brings the junkies 8 songs never officially released live (Wicker Man, Ghost, BNW, Blood Brothers, Sign of the Cross, Mercenary, Dream of Mirrors, and The Clansman). Of course, you still get all the regulars just in case you really wanted a 9th live version of NOB to add to your collection!<br />Listening to this disc brought back all the great memories of this tour.  The quality is great, the production is nearly flawless and Bruce's voice holds up well. You can feel the energy here is much better than Maiden's last live offerings (Real Live/Dead One) which were tired, borish and lacking Adrian Smith. A very important piece of the puzzle.<br />If you like Maiden (and you should) this disc is a can't-miss.
B00003CXTG|2.0|This film begs the question, \\"Why bother?\\" Every aspect of this film has been done better in at least one movie. The love story cannot compare to \\"From Here to Eternity.\\" The events at Pearl Harbor are surpassed by \\"Tora, Tora, Tora.\\" The Doolittle raid was covered more enjoyably in \\"60 Seconds Over Tokyo.\\" This film is a pale version of all those great movies. Was this movie great as some reviewers contend? Not when compared to those and \\"The Battle of Midway\\", \\"The Flying Leathernecks\\", or even \\"South Pacific\\". The CGI was impressive at some times and unwatchable at others. When crew members fell off the bombed out ships, they flew in parabolic arcs. Now I don't expect animators to be physics majors, but I would like them to have seen something fall. The \\"Top Gun\\" gimmickry was hard to take as well. Oh, look at the bad boys. Make sure you remember what they get chewed out for, because it's the secret weapon later on.<br />Moving on to the events of the day. Yes, we were caught by surprise, though new evidence presents intriguing new questions to the debate. Yes, the bases were devastated. Yes, there were signs that any Monday morning quarterback could spot. But, as the attack happened, training took over. \\"Pearl Harbor\\" depicts most of those caught in the event to be wholly inept cowards. I've since gone back and reviewed some real footage of the event, and watched brave men strip machine guns from crippled planes while under fire, stepping in to take the place of those who are shot. Damage control teams fighting fires as enemy planes strafe. This movie is a disservice to all their memories. <br />\\"If you want historical accuracy, go to the library\\" is what I believe one reviewer wrote. I have two very important questions for that reviewer, and all who believe that. Was Pearl Harbor such a boring event that lies need to be told in order to be entertaining? Did the brave men and women who chose to defend our country at a time when most turned their backs on the events in Europe and Asia need to be portrayed so poorly, and on the day that is reserved to commemorate them? Idiotic scenes of Americana saturate the beginning of the attack; a group of boys playing baseball, a woman hanging clothes on the line. IT WAS 7:00 IN THE MORNING! Does anyone who watched the movie know why Cuba Gooding Jr's character got a medal? I'll give you a hint. It was not for boxing.<br />There are many wonderful stories yet to be told about Pearl Harbor, and CGI can bring that event to us more vividly than ever before, so save your praises for this horse. It's dead.
B00005QIPH|3.0|The good news about The Strokes album is that they have a catchy-yet-droning feel, sort of a hideous mutation of the genes of Lou Reed and Harry Connick, Jr., and they don't waste time on guitar solos and similar muck.<br />The bad news is that on about half these rather interchangeable numbers The Strokes start to sound as if they take themselves seriously, which is a fatal flaw in a group that probably sounds best when there's a quarter-inch of keg beer on the linoleum.<br />And why do the vocals sound as if the microphone is fried?<br />Buy it anyway. It's still a thousand times better than the latest splompff from the Goateed Fop du Jour.
630562285X|2.0|After reading through other reviews of Entrapment I can't help but feel I saw the wrong movie. The version I saw was a never ending string of cliches embedded into a plot so flimsy it couldn't stand up if it were not for Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The direction of Jon Amiel was a never ending series of well worn manipulation techniques that were not even well done. I don't mind being a passive observer, but I do not like to be blatantly manipulated.<br />Several times during the movie I found it difficult not to laugh out load at the ludicrousness of what I was seeing. For example, in the well advertised scene of Catherine Zeta-Jones wriggling her way through the fake laser beams I couldn't stop thinking \\"Why doesn't she just crawl\\" or \\"What was the point of that move?\\" It's indicative of the whole movie. It's a scene played for the audience, and we aren't supposed to be there. In another scene between Sean Connery and Ving Rhames, Rhames scolds Connery for changing partners etc. Who is this scene for? We discover later in yet one more feeble plot twist that these two know this conversation is a sham, but rather than playing it out to further some clever hidden agenda it is solely to pull the wool over the eyes of the audience. And as I've stated before, the audience is not supposed to be there.<br />There are so many good caper movies... It is truly a disservice to the research that went into making those movies to add this fairy tale to the same genre... In short this movie was a waste of time and money.
0748662529|5.0|Alexander McCall Smith's The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is a passionate tale of a love affair with Africa alongside a poignant tale of a struggle for gender equality. Precious Ramotswe, a private detective, sets up her first business venture in the African country of Botswana with her inheritance from her father's death.  Coupled with Precious' desire to honor her father's cherished memory, this rotund detective is driven to make a solid place for herself in the male-dominated professional world. <br />Social commentary abounds throughout the text through small details. For instance, the success that Precious meets in her detective endeavors stems not from her trusty \\"Detective Guide\\" written by a male but from following her own female intuition. Also, the author's passion and respect for an independently governed Africa shine through as  peaceful Botswana is continually juxtaposed with the apartheid-ridden South Africa.<br />Readers will enjoy the adventures and risks that Precious Ramotswe encounters through this fun, unique, and socially challenging first novel of the series.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Star Wars was not put on the AFI's top 100 list because it looked good, had cool special effects, or exciting action sequences. It is there because it is a great film. The Phantom Menace is a typical 90's action/adventure heavy on Special Effects and light on substance. Obi Wan was in Star Wars less than half the movie, but I know more about him than I do about any character in Phantom Menace. Han Solo is a character everyone wants to be, or at least meet. Luke is a gape jawed simple farm boy who is thrust into the big bad world unprepared. Leia is the leader of a movement she knows is more important than herself, or indeed any one person.<br />The Phantom Menace has all the drama and intrigue of C-SPAN. &quot;The motion before the floor is, should we care about a war over trade on a planet no one cares about? The yeas are 192, the neas are 387, the measure does not pass....Next item of business...&quot; (Yawn!)<br />There was no character development, no internal conflicts, no hard decisions to make. In short it was a mindless romp through a story we all know the end to, full of pretty pictures and flashy sword fights. Check your brain at the door. We have special effects now, who needs a good story.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I will keep it simple. This CD will sell for years to come because this young lady has a bright future in the music biz. &quot;Ready for Love&quot; is easily the most well written song of the year and others on the album are just as tight. I wish you the best India and I am so happy that somone gave you a chance to be a recording artist. God Bless You.
B000002MG1|5.0|This album has so many levels of melancholia and whats surprising is that they have manage to evoke all those levels out when i'm listening to it. I didnt quite get the emotive level of this CD on the first spin, although the tunes were pretty much there. It was only through subsequent spins where i felt the wafts of melancholy permeating through the melody. So prophetic so so beautiful<br />One should know one is headed for a good dose of emotions by the first track itself. Drive has a portentous and a been-there-done-that kind of feel to it...a sort of jadedly prophesised historical event ! ...yes i know that sounds warped...but so are most of stipe's lyrics anyway. Well as far as free associative lyrics and imagery go, REM has always been pretty good at mixing them with the lyrics. <br />Beautiful, Beautifully Melancholic. Beatifully Melancholic for the Soulful by the Soulful. I dont know why the condemnation for New Orleans Instrumental No.1 . I think that this song is instrumental in the flow of the album. I can not imagine not having this song in the album although i can imagine the absence of Ignoreland. it is hard. it fits in perfectly after Everybody Hurts. What should Stipe sing after an all out singing on Everybody Hurts? Nothing! Thats how New Orleans works! <br />And yes...the last 3 songs of the album are the best combo i've ever heard! A song about insanity, recollection and hope ! The lyrics dont intermingle but it certainly looks like there is some direction to stipe's lyrics<br />I've only written 2 five stars reviews to far. This is one of it. The other is Clash's London Calling. There are a lot of contenders but none are as reassuringly classic as these 2 albums at this point. Although i can see Radiohead's OK Computer and Frente!'s Marvin the Album heading to the pedestal. these 2 albums, still needs about a couple of 100 more spins before i can give a review more accurate to what i feel. And yes...i have listen to AFTP and London CAlling more than a 100 times already! So trust me on this review, ...
B00005RY7X|5.0|People seem to think that because this isn't deep, heartful, innovative music, it isn't good.  Well those people need to get off their pedestal and be quiet, just cause he isn't writing about a man searching for a purpose, or some garbage like bob dylan, doesn't mean it's bad.  It's simple, fast, and good music.  If you need to feel smart, then this isn't for you.  Don't listen to this album to have enlightenment, there are enough terrible bands out there to provide you with that.  Listen to this album cause it's fun to listen to.
B000060P79|5.0|I consider myself a musical fan who listens to everything, But I will admit I have a low tolerance for POPPUNK! Im not a big blink 182 fan, But I do like bands like goldfinger, and sum 41 (MY HOMETOWN BOYZZ!).  I went to see Simple Plan live knowing NO songs. The show was 6 bucks and my friend wanted to go and since she loves POP PUNK I obliged! OMG....These guys blew me away and they are now my new fave band! EVERY song on this cd is good, ppl are right u will not want to skip any of them! My faves are I'm just a kid, I'll meet u there, and PERFECT (This is the most amazingly heartfelt song, and the fact that these guys could write something like this on their first album shows they have mega potential!!).  They may get compared to Blink 182, but trust me their musical styles are much more developed! GET THIS CD NOW BEFORE THEY GET POPULAR AND IT GOES UP IN PRICE...Trust me you will love it!! They already have songs on \\"THE NEW GUY\\" and \\"CLOCKSTOPPERS\\" Soundtracks so you can tell these guys are gonna be huge! ANd if u get a chance, TOTALLY SEE EM LIVE, theyre great and really nice guys too!!<br />AND BTW, I'm not some 13 year old writing this review.  I'm 19 so if you think this music is just for little kids, I tell you you're totally wrong!!!

If you are an action buff, if you like drama, or if you just like movies than Gladiator is for you! The actions scenes are realisiticly intriguing and it is exciting to watch. Hans Zimmer's music is perfect, along with Russel Crowe.
B0000640VO|5.0|I just enjoyed the move Amelie so much.  I thought that the Cinematography was wonderful.  All the vivid colors brought the world of Amelie to life before my and the rest of the viewers eyes.  I liked the way most of the story was told out of Amelie's thoughts.  This technique helped us understand Amelie.  Amelie is a must see for everyone whether the understand French or not the subtitles are easy to read and understand!<BR>P.S.  The garden gnome was the best!

0812550757|4.0|Having read the first book in the series of which this is the second, I was quite anxious to see where the story went next.  The first book, &quot;Ender's Game&quot; was a true sci-fi action novel which, to date, is the best I have read.  Knowing this, I was more than ready to see where the hero of the story went next.<br />Alas, the author seems to have taken a radical departure from the style of the first book.  &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; is a much more slowly developed story with much deeper characters.  The story seems to be more deliberately developed, with quite a large portion of the book devoted to a back-story.<br />Once adjusted to the different style of book, I became intrigued by the newly introduced characters, and the dilemmas they face on this far away colony on a planet habitated by a completely foreign race.  It is an interesting statement on how the humans react and treat the foreign race ... one that I would find entirely plausible.<br />Eventually, the main character makes a trip to the planet to learn the story of both a recently-passed human, but also to understand the interaction of the person with the foreign race.  The hero eventually tears down the barriers (literally and figuratively) between the races and essentially turns the whole coloney on its ear.<br />The story is very well told, with outstanding character development, and scenery description.  Card does a great job of capturing the emotions of the moment.  He also does a great job of conveying the technology aspects of the sci-fi novel without obsessing on them or letting them get in the way of the story.  It is a great balance.<br />What I found somewhat difficult was the love-story sewn into the novel.  I thought that it was rather 'convenient' and perhaps could have been more fully developed.<br />Other than that minor nit, it was a very good read, and I look forward to continuing on the series.
0812550757|5.0|The author begins this book with his reasons for writing this book.  He credits this book for the novelette version of Ender's Game, which until that point was only a short story.  He had to rewrite this story from scratch several times over because he kept getting stuck with what to do with Novinha's children.  The very first version he wrote didn't give them any character.  They were there not to advance the plot, but as stubs for a family.  He later realized though that the cornerstone of the story had to be Novinha's children.  I really thought that bestowing Miro, Ela, Quim, Olhado, Quara and Grego with personalities of their own would just confuse me.  But it didn't!  The fact that I can name them off to you without referring to the book and have some brief description of each in mind shows you how memorable the author has made them.<br />What keeps the reader hooked on this book is the mystery of why Pipo and Libo get killed.  The author slowly trickles this information to the reader with clever document excerpts from research logs, official ansible messages, etc. on top of the daily activities of the key characters.  Ender, the original Speaker for the Dead and writer of the Hive Queen and the Hegemon, is called for by Novinha to speak Pipo's death.  However, as far as star travel goes, 22 years will have gone by before he reaches Lusitania.  In the meantime, Novinha has given birth to her 6 children and has reneged on her call for a speaker.  Right before Ender arrives, Libo is killed and Marcao (Novinha's husband) dies from a genetic defect.  Miro and Ela each call for a speaker as well to speak respectively for their deaths.  So, in effect, Ender is there to speak for 3 deaths.  How the story unfolds truly is surprising and shocking.  It kept me wondering.<br />This is a very different book from Ender's Game.  Both of these books are enjoyable for entirely different reasons.  Ender's game was a lot more \\"earthly\\", had more action and described the world in the eyes of a child.  Speaker for the Dead starts off on another planet and leads the reader on a path of discovery through the eyes of a family.  It deals heavily with emotions, human interactions and communication.  This book has a very strong religious backdrop.  From the whole notion of Lusitania being a Catholic-licenced settlement, to the structure of their society and customs.  The three literary conflicts that can exist in a story between man vs. other men, man vs. himself and man vs. his environment are present in Speaker for the Dead.  The taboo of adultery, murder and incest are also mentioned.  On top of this, the author also manages to make this a work of fantasy.  The author describes another alien race with their own way of life.  To be able to pull all these together in a coherent and compelling story, truly is talent.<br />I highly recommend this book if you enjoyed Ender's Game and find the concept for a Speaker of the Dead interesting.
