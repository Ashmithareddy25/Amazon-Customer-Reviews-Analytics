1402766785|4.0|Great and quit clear guide - handbook for an artists. Endless field of the drawing needs every chance to upgrade your mastership
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is the best game in the world I'm on the best at this game .
B000ICXQGK|3.0|It was hard for me to follow.  I was assigned this movie as a school project.  I was asked to identify what religion was being portrayed in the movie and it was not evident to me.
B00AHDXTIK|1.0|I previously left a bad review because my iPhone 5 kept saying not compatible.  Finally realized it was my charger and not the cable!  So, updated review is 5 stars, especially since it fits with my Lifeproof case.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|An old favorite. A great look at addiction and the world that surrounds it. Also, one of the best climaxes in a film.
B0058VW36U|5.0|As fun as this game really is, it is a real big challenge. I don't recommend it for little kids. If I could give it a 4 1/2 stars, I would.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|My favorite movie of all the time. I watch this movie when I was a kid and now than i'm older I still fall in love with the plot, characters and landscape.
B00433TO52|2.0|I like Shakespeare plays. The kindle version of this book was hard to read. When reading a Play, its hard to determine which character is speaking. Plus it doesn't tell you what line you are reading.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a perfect app if you are looking to play a simple game of solitaire.  no complaints from me though the touch screen can be difficult for bigger fingers. _
B0091REZMW|4.0|Wish there were other ways to earn diamonds. Energy depletes to fast but the game is fun. Addictin also. Idk what else.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Warning!  You will become addicted to this show!  Great characters that allow viewers a glimpse into the English aristocracy and the individuals that made their lifestyle possible!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Had no idea what this was going to be about... This book that seemed to show up on every &#34;must read&#34; summer reading list.  Totally random, compelling, deep, thoughtful.  Loved it although I am not really sure I truly get it.  Will be thinking about this book for a long time to come.
B001KK2NDQ|5.0|I've wanted this book for many years and finally decided to buy it. The book is in excellent condition and I'm very happy with it. Thank you so much.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It works very well and does what it is intended to do.  I recommend this for anyone who needs a flashlight in a pinch.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is a lot of fun and is very addictive. However there seems to be a problem with it freezing up. I go to run again and it just hangs up and my kindle's battery has to die before I can use it for anything. Tonight it doesn't want to go past the intro. Says its downloading yet it stays at 0% and never loads!! If some of the bugs can be worked out I would give it 5 stars.
140006922X|4.0|Aslan gives readers a chance to understand the context in which Jesus most likely lived. His writing style is compelling, creative, and engaging. If you want a history book made for the masses, but still informative this is it!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game to keep yourself occupied for a short time each day. Takes time to get through the levels & a lot of extras will cost you but can still play the game easily without paying a cent.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|interesting, opens a window into an unknown culture, well written, good discussion for a book club.kept me in suspens.will try to raed more books by her.
B0089OBLDO|5.0|I had another adapter, but a friend wanted one and I tried this one, of course I bought one for myself.<br />i'm a tournament player, for fighting games and of course I hate xbox360 controller, as the product says you need a xbox360 cord controller (NOT the DEFAULT the console has or usb cable), and have a ps2 controller to play with a decent pad in xbox360<br /><br />NOTE: if you want to connect an arcade stick ps3 to xbox360, is not possible (buy a qanba Q4F recommended), if xbox360 to ps3 it will work.<br /><br />The product has a CD for pc, I already tried without the driver, it worked, but well still have that option.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Zero input lag<br />- NO odd behavior in the controller (happes with other adapter I have)<br />- Good quality<br /><br />CONS:<br />- NO Arcade Stick PS3 to Xbox360 (mod it don't be a pussy), but arcade stick xbox360 to ps3 YES
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game for the kids. All the time I play this game, i don't feel bored. My little cousin always plays this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is so fun because you can go through grus lab and el machos lair and even through the neighborhood great family app too. Everybody should have this app:)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It really reminds me of Mario games really love it !!!!!!!!! Really commend it for those who loves Mario games
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|If you like games where you get your own profile without having to sign in to Facebook or Twitter, this is the game for you. I have played this for a while and I can't even tell you how much fun it is. If you get this game I hope you like it
B003WE9TU8|3.0|While I enjoyed aspects of WWZ, I found the differing accounts hard to join together.<br />Very difficult to build into this plot and relate to characters. There was no building of a plot and an ultimate result.<br /><br />I did enjoy the concept of the Plague, The panic, the fightback etc, however I would have preferred to follow the path of any number of characters throughout their entire journey and not just snippets of their perspective.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am hooked hooked and hooked and you will be too .  Start right from the beginning and you won't be able to stop
B004UID2LC|4.0|the Freedi utube downloader is awesome.<br />u can download all ur Favorite songs by saving them to ur gallery and when u play them no wi ti is needed :)
B008ALAHA4|4.0|I bought this for my first Mac ever (yes I drank the kool-aid) but what I didn't know was that there are two power connections for the MacBook Air and the new Air's (last year or so) use a MagSafe 2 adapter which is not mentioned in the ads for extra AC power adapters. So I had to buy two because I didn't understand the difference.<br /><br />The thing to watch out for is that this is a little tiny piece of metal that holds on with a magnet just like your power adapter. So you need to be careful and not accidently knock it off somewhere by accident. Other than that it works great.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|I mean, what more could you want from a mafia movie...funny, disturbing, gory at times, and best of all getting to see Lorraine Bracco in her prime!!! Yes, please.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|This book was very much more than I thought it would be.  As far as decisions go, the main character definitely has a big one to make!  As the author carries you through the story, you are brought deeper and deeper into this young girl's world.  Forman has a way of making the reader feel exactly how the main character feels through her descriptions and brings you close to all the characters involved.
B00130EVSS|4.0|Theres no real surprise ending to this movie, but it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Intel has ALWAYS been my brand of choice for processor, hands down. This processor continues the reliability and power that all processors from Intel boast. I almost went for the i5, but didn't need a quad core processor. However, I felt a little regret with not spending $90 more to get it, but after installing this i3 into my desktop build, I am happy to have saved the money because the dual-core i3 does everything I want and more.
B00006879E|5.0|Songs About Jane is extraordinary. The beats and melodies, the song topics, the infusion of R&B, pop, rock & soul..everything about this album is just too great to put in words. Adam Levine's voice is smooth like butter, haunting and spine chilling at times. His voice meshes so well with the instruments..pure magic!! I would definitely recommend this album to any and everyone!!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I don't use it very often. It is a good app to have if you don't have an alarm. =)
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Great songs, great music, great performance, even without Joe's usual guitar rifs.  Interesting mix of instruments.  Definitely a favorite in our household, playing over and over.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is an ok game. Some things are not easy to play. I bought this for my children and they don't play it often.
B00821OX98|5.0|This series reminds me of the NBC series Revolution, but since I like Revolution, I like this one. I've only watched 5 episodes so far, but they are all good. Definitely worth watching.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It is an ok game. Some things are not easy to play. I bought this for my children and they don't play it often.
B001FB55I0|5.0|I'm not a huge movie buff and not one of those people that care about the storyline and how a character develops, etc etc.....zzzzzz<br /><br />I give this movie 5 stars for the action, killing, gun shots, death, gore, chaos, etc etc<br /><br />Also sounds really great on a home theater system.
B005HSL626|3.0|It is an ok game. Some things are not easy to play. I bought this for my children and they don't play it often.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Do not like this newer version at all. Would like to see the old version back it was much simpler to use.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|It only helps with certain levels. I wish they had the actual game for the Kindle. That would be better.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I loved this movie.  I am not claiming that you will love it, just that I did.  I am a Gen X zombie enthusiast who hates romantic comedies.  It was clever and funny and even made me a little melty.  It had a neat premise and gave a look into the thought process and emotional state of the undead that I haven't seen in a movie before.  Did I mention that it's really funny?  5 stars from me.  -- Take with a grain of salt, I also like Evil Dead and Troma Films...
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It is an ok game. Some things are not easy to play. I bought this for my children and they don't play it often.
B00BESM14U|3.0|I guess it was Ok.  If I had it to do over again I would avoid it until the fateful night it's on cable and I have nothing better to do.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|This is the recently translated and released book one of the Harry Holy series by Norwegian writer Jo Nesbø.  It is great roller coaster of a read. The protagonist, Detective Holy, is sent to Sydney to help the police to catch the serial killer. Twists and turns abound.  You follow a flawed alcoholic Holy in holiday fun and suffering. And of course, you see the very worst of Sydney, up close in person and almost in smellarama!<br />And this is the third one I have read, and I will drop by for more!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|What a book!  It was both inspirational and heart breaking.  Should be a required reading for everybody from16 to 99 years of age!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved seeing it all at once. You care about the characters and it does represent that time period. Didn't realize how hard change is... For everyone
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|This book has plenty of both old and new world charm to it. The whole book is more or less written in this routine: Introduce a character, then the people who shape that character's life (with misery mostly) and then the picking up of pieces and rebuilding life phase. The plot takes you all over the world starting from Shadbagh in Pakistan & moving on to Kabul, America, Paris, Greece & India. Way too many characters compared to his previous novels which i liked better but this book is not bad overall.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|Ok. It took longer to download than it did to play. Graphics are mediocre and the story I have no clue about since it is so short. There is a ghost that makes an appearance a couple of times. Whooo wooo. .... I really love this type of game and I've bought nearly a dozen.Enchanted paintings, Shiver, Enigmatis, Twisted lands, Empress one and two etc, are all better than this little snippet of nothing. This game doesnt tempt me.
1451662432|4.0|I am a big Arnold Schwarzenegger fan so I loved this book. I've seen all of his movies and this book was a nice &#34;inside&#34; to his life and history. A great buy!
1878424114|5.0|I'm trying to get more spiritual. I like I everything about this book I recommend this book for everybody to read.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Has some really cliffhanging moments, anything with Liam is a must see in my mind...thankx again to Amazon for the quality I have come to expect.
1607066017|5.0|The story starts with new life, a few curse words, and a firefight/magic battle.<br />A war ravaged galaxy fixates itself on an unlikely couple and their newborn babe as they try to start a new life.  Stunning art, story line and a perfect comic for fairy tale and scifi lover alike.
B0085YNML2|4.0|This game was my 1st o my kindle. 9 months later its still a good game. It has replay  value. The game stays fun and cute. Some puzzles were harder then th  I liked but still it's a must have for anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|LOVE this book. I work full time and have 2 kids under age 6 ... I needed an escape book to read and this book does just that. Can't wait to read the other two!
B004H6G0TI|4.0|I personally loved the game. With the different planes and some even had lasers or homing missals. I found it entertaining. The one thing I didn't liken was it never told you how to get th  x2...x3...x4 etc or the ace shot thing in which you get Jonas points. That's annoying. It's a great game for anyone.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|read the novel first!!!<br />then watch the beauty, the fresh, pure character Pi and the story of man & animal, animal and man....<br />and the elements, both natural and man made elements, so creative and brillian...a classic!
B009DCOU9S|1.0|Mystery and puzzles sit in in a tree G-u-e-s-s-i-n-g. I am sorry an  sad to say this game is not a puzzle game but a guessing game. This was a waste of time and money (if it wasn't the free app of the day). I have.removed it free my kindle. Do not get and do not buy.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|Graphics are terrible and the game hard to learn. Gave it to me son and he put it down after a few minutes.
B00881PTRC|4.0|There is no need to elaborate on the gameplay which is just like traditional hangman. The music is pleasant and the animations are well done. The only fault I can find is that when I lose,  the correct letters are filled in in yellow type against a slightly paler yellow background. Almost impossible to read!  The developers could fix this easily, but perhaps it is that way as an incentive to never make errors. Lol!
0399159347|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is intriguing to think about how our secrets and decisions shape our whole big lives. I really like the authors last book as well.
B002L5KKK2|5.0|This is a realistic film about a bygone era!  DeNiro is always amazing.  Worth the time it takes to watch!
1623420148|5.0|Funny and entertaining! Good light reading very well done. Good characters,would like to see them again.Hope to see them again
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not a book reviewer, but this work deserves a few words of praise.  A very well written novel, that has made me a real Hugh Howey fan! This book ranks right near the top of my list of favorites! I can't wait to read more from Mr Howey.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great show. Watched it every free moment I had.  Luis is my favorite character, followed by Jessica.  I don't know why no one told me about this show earlier.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|Just recently youtube on moblie on silk for my kindle fire stopped  working. So people said to go here. It was working just fine till I shut my kindle fire off in the middle of a video. Now it won't play any of the videos I want. I even restarted the app. I don't know what to do and I just want youtube back. :(
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this game it one of the best portable games there is and you don't have to be online to play it.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Love the Wi-Fi capability so I can see Facebook, AND my books online wherever I travel.  Also love, love, love being able to get to my favorite games when there's nothing else to do.
B008Y5FNL4|1.0|Apocalypse Now combines every negative stereotype of the American Soldier in Vietnam into a bad acid trip of a movie
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable imaginative and quirky romp through 20th century with an adorably outrageous group of characters.  If you don't want/are unable to embrace the absurd, this book may not be for you - but if you enjoy having your preconceptions outraged and gently poked fun at, you'll love it.  It's a bit like being on a particularly good roller-coaster - \\"I shouldn't be enjoying this but I am\\"  \\"What next?\\"  Would make a fantastic film too!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I'm only 13 and I normally don't like books like this but this book was amazing!!I couldn't stop reading this book was supposed be my summer book but I read it in 2 days!! Wonder<br />Was wonderfully written. I loved how you can see the story through other people's eyes!Once you start this book you will not put it down I loved wonder!
B00B81B0HC|5.0|My son was asking for one song. I look and found the album for a great price for download. So i got the whole album for not much more than one song. No bad language on the disk at all. My son loves it, I always put music on mp3 players anyway and no worrying about loosing the disk or getting it scratched up because it is in the cloud. Easy to stream and download.
B0036TGT3E|3.0|The bluray was great. My brother has enjoyed it very much. The dvd not so great. While I was watching the movie it started getting stuck so I took the disc out just to find out that it was completely scratched.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun. makes you think and make the connections. challenging, but not too frustrating. cant wait for more levels. keep up the good work
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Romantic, enticing, sexy, romantic drama. Very addicting, you cant put it down. Highly recommend to anyone who loves books like 50 shades.
B00000IZOR|5.0|This item has been around for years with a reason it's awesome for the little ones. They love phones it gives them the imagination of pretend.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Romantic, enticing, sexy, romantic drama. Very addicting, you cant put it down. Highly recommend to anyone who loves books like 50 shades.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't put it down. The b oss battles are pretty fun. One of the best running games I have played since Temple Run 2. The powerhouse are pretty cool and funny . My favorite is continuing and Gru's rocket
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|entertaining, addicting and fun to watch. A great show, if you into drama... it has a little bit of everything.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I like the story line. I'm into mysteries. More than other hidden object games. I'm glad I downloaded this one. I grew tired of other games too quickly.
B005M5OSBK|5.0|As a Boomer and veteran of Woodstock I've tuned out of so much of today's music. Friends recently took me to a Pink Martini concert and all I can say is thank you, thank you for turning me on to a group with so many accomplished musicians and such an eclectic sound and style. Turn on this disc, close your eyes be transported to sounds from around the world.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Although this book sometimes was difficult to follow because of the huge volumes of background the author included,  the story(s) of the main characters were compelling.  This story is universal to all nationalities and all time periods-it applies to all.  I liked it very much.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|Some corny scenes and bad acting but overall fun to watch. Had some cool action and a diving headshot! Would watch again.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I love Denzel. He was amazing in this movie. I loved it so much I bought two copies not knowing it. I gave one to my mama and she loves it too.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I honestly didn't think this would keep my interest very long, but it was amazing.  A lot of detail and didn't get boring.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I like  every song.  Love their style which is so uplifting yet can bring your foot to dancing along with the music.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|And unlike candy crush there's nothing more to purchase to move ahead.  Gets more challenging as you move ahead,  but my 11 year old can still play and enjoy it.
B00DGNO3WE|1.0|Oh.My.Lord. Was this movie boring!  That's about all I can say.  It had great actors but the whole thing made me feel claustrophobic and kinda delirious (which is how most of the seniors acted during the film.)  I ALWAYS look for the good in movies but sadly this fell flat.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|We watched this movie as a family and it was terrific. My boys are 9 and 2 and they loved the movie. My husband and I were laughing pretty hard as well. The story is pretty hilarious, the dialogue is hysterical, and there's enough going on that the 2-year old could follow the story without understanding all of the words being spoken. No violence, no bad language, just a a great story. Big thumbs up.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I hated for this book to end. So far it is the best book I've read all summer. Unlike the Kite Runner, this book focuses on the complex relationships with mothers and daughters. I recommend this book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game to waste a bit of the day.  Puzzles challenge but don't get too frustrating. I enjoy it.<br />It is something I can keep going back to.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Quests are too short and sometimes don't make sense, and going to the same room over and over is annoying.plus we run out of diamonds too fast.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|this game is way fun however it is also way glitchy! I think the design has some serious issues and it takes forever to load!!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is good for like when you want to just waste time or think like this is the city that you want when you grow up.
B00338QENI|4.0|I usually have a hard time reading non-fiction.  I think that the passion and committment Ms Skloot had for her project was evident by the way she told the story.<br /><br />The story brings to light some interesting moral and ethical issues.  I don't want to get too wordy here, so I will just say that this book could lead to lengthy discussions about these issues....at least I hope my book club thinks so.<br /><br />I do recommend this book, it is an imporatant part of our history, and I thank Ms Skloot for taking the time to tell the story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game. play it with my 6 year old and she loves guessing! she says it is a good game.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This gAme is soo funn I can play this alllll dayyy !! I love thiS app :) thank you dmdmdmdndjsmsksksks mask dishes diamonds
B005K17RU0|5.0|When on vacation I now know the weather for where I'm at at where I'm going.<br />Plus can check in for weather at home.  Happy, Happy!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|It will take me a long time to master this one which is a good thing. This is the first Angry birds for my tablet. Maybe that's why it's more difficult for me.
B00DJUPLY8|4.0|I like that I 'm able to listen to sermons now on my kindle!!!!<br />Was thinking about needing to purchase something else to listen on instead of my kindle....yeah this has kept me from having to<br />do that cause I do love my kindle fire!
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|Being disabled, I can only sit at the computer for a few minutes now. So when I found free Mahjong apps for my tablet it was a no brainer. This app seems to be the best for me so far. I,m always looking.
B00E8B1358|5.0|As usual, with the quality of the HD movies from this site, excellent. This is a good movie that follows the vain of the other two except this one is more intense. More action and edge of your seat entertainment. A must see, shoot why not own it, I'm going to see it again!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love how quick every episode evolves, the historical part of it not forgetting a bit of romance. I also very much love the characters. Maggie Smith is simply flawless!
0307887448|2.0|I just finished reading Ready Player One and there were some pros and cons to the book.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Many cool 80's references<br />2. It is about video games and brings back cool memories of being a child of the 80's and 90's<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The actual quality of the writing was sub-par, felt like it was written for 8 year olds<br />2. The 80's references were cool, but at some point it felt like he was just putting down a everything he could remember about the 80's with little connection.  You could just as easily find a Wiki for 'Top movies of the 80's'<br />3. The main character was as chiche as could be and I felt incredibly one dimensional. I know in some ways we were reminded our younger years when we were the \\"nerds\\" in school and we spent a bunch of time playing video games rather than sports, but still the main character was not well developed.<br />4. The political connotations of the book are horrible - everything about corporations being bad, profit being bad, etc.<br /><br />But it was cool to be reminded of those 80's events, movies, games, etc that I had not thought about for years.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Five stars means &#34;I love it&#34;.  WE LOVE IT. We sporadically watched portions of several episodes, and a few full episodes on our local cable provider BBC TV channel until finding Seasons One and Two at its Free On Demand channel. I was surprised when my wife insisted there is another episode following Season Two's last - said she watched it, it HAS to be there & to look again.....whatever....so my first ever internet  research regarding movies/TV shows resulted in this purchase of Season 3, and sadly, learning that we must eagerly wait, like most everybody else, for Season 4 (and the next season of Sherlock).<br /><br />Blu-ray enhances picture clarity/detail & the HD 1080i format fills our HD screen (unlike those pesky wide screen movie formats that makes more look like less).  This is my only movie DVD purchase ever. Quicker to launch & more reliable than internet download/streaming, provided disc is close. Viewing Options by far superior.
B00064VR0W|5.0|If you love Rod, you will love this too! He is an amazing singer and puts on a great show.
B000059ZIC|5.0|This well recorded disc from 1967 contains the first full set of the three Brahms violin sonatas and, as such, Decca threw down the gauntlet to anyone following on. Their faith in this set of recordings has proved to be well founded as, even today over 40 years later, this disc is still considered a reference set of performances and the recording has achieved a new lease of life in its latest re-mastering.<br /><br />Recordings made on analogue tape simply had a wider signal range than that possible on the early CDs which explains why so many collectors with high end LP players were disappointed by the lack of range and realism of the new CD medium. It is only with this latest set of remastering that modern listeners are able to experience the sounds previously enjoyed by those LP enthusiasts. Just how much was missing on those early CDs can readily be heard on this new generation of discs, including this one. There is greater dynamic range, frequency range, depth of field and general sense of 'presence.'<br /><br />The performances themselves are superb, taking us through the earlier and more serene first two sonatas to the more dramatic and larger scaled third sonata in one creative overview. Suk's violin tone is not large or heavy such as can be found in many Russian players, not does it have the steely edge found in some American players. Instead it is smaller, precisely focussed, quite a sweet sound but with a distinct cutting edge. This is ideally suited to his chamber music by Brahms and Katchen proves to be a most sympathetic partner. It was Decca's idea to partner them together, but this was so successful that the pair went on to form the very successful Suk trio with Janos Starker on cello.<br /><br />There have been other fine sets of these sonatas since 1967 of course, and I would include Mullova/Anderszewski and Osostowicz/Tomes on CD and Mutter/Orkis on dvd/Blu-ray for further reference. All three of those additional sets bring different personalities and violin tone to bear on these works.<br /><br />There can never be a definitive version of such staple repertoire, but it can confidently be stated that Suk and Katchen must be considered as belonging to the very best.

B003QSJVTY|5.0|I love this movie. It never gets old. It's classic Nicholas Cage and it makes me want to pull a boost.
B00821OX98|4.0|I like this series. The acting is pretty good and the story flows fairly smoothly. The effects aren't too bad either. I'm only 2/3 through the first season but I look forward to each next episode. If you want something to kick back to before hitting the sack and you like sci-if and aliens, then you'll enjoy this show.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Great script, actors and music. Uptempo Hollywood style. The recurrent topics with aliens and apocalyptic cliches. The enemy without is again addressed.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|Everything about this series is first rate. The casting, acting, script, sets, and cinematography would do credit to a A-List movie. Not only have I watched it twice, but I liked it so much I have now ordered the Blu-ray disks for the original English BBC version. Can't wait for the second season!<br /><br />I do want to respond to one reviewer who said they didn't like the program because Kevin Spacey's congressman was mean. That's just wrong. Spacey's character isn't mean or cruel or evil, he's just pragmatic. He can hurt someone - you could say he's even an expert at this in some ways - but he doesn't hurt just to be mean. For me, that characteristic is one of the things that made this series so enchanting.<br /><br />Highly recommend !
1452110581|5.0|This book was originally given to me as a gift and I put it on the counter in the guest bathroom.  It was a major hit with guests who needed a little reading material while they were there.  As it happens, a friend had a birthday coming up and since the book had been so well-received, and since the friend is a cat-lover, I ordered this copy for her.  It, too, was a great success ~~
B003L77GGK|5.0|Season 6 is a bit better than Season 5. I love Supernatural. It is one of my top 5 favorite shows for sure and probably in my top 3. Having said that there really is no doubt that after the strike shortened 3rd year the show slowly started to go down hill a bit. Once Dean died and they added Angels in it just wasn't as... believable maybe. (That may just be the former seminary student in me though...) I love Castiel. Don't get me wrong. Its all of the other angels I don't like and their treatment of heaven. But I can look past that and I honestly feel that the show is starting to pick back up again. I would recommend.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I am history buff who enjoy visual  presentations through film and books .  I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who has like interests.
B00005JLKN|5.0|Edward Norton is a much better FBI Agent than Jodi Foster. For that reason alone I have always loved this movie more than Silence of the Lambs. Don't get me wrong Silence of the Lambs is one of my Favorite movies but Red Dragon edges it out in my book just a little. if you have not seen this movie.... well what is wrong with you! Stop reading my review and go watch it!!!
B008A36R2Y|5.0|This is an authentic Arduino. I was concerned because it was priced lower than most other vendors, but it is truly authentic and a quality product.
0765325950|5.0|I love Robert Jordan. Don't get me wrong. I know what I am about to say right now is blaspheme but I really think I actually liked the story better once Brandon Sanderson took over. The books he wrote to finish the series are my favorite books of all time. If you haven't read the Wheel of Time then I recommend checking it out but start with the first one. It is a little slow at first so have some patience. By book three I couldn't put them down. Best series I have ever read.
B005UG542S|4.0|Of course I loved the movie because it was the end of a great series. I think the team did a good job trying to tie up loose ends since there was a lot of information and details that had been left out of the previous movies, but were very important to the story line. There were a couple things that I just didn't like that were changed in the movie because I didn't think that they made as good of an impact, but there were also a couple of changes that were for the better. Hence, four stars. The book series, though, will forever be a favorite and highly recommended to everybody out there.
B000001DV2|5.0|If you do not own this album then you should buy it. Hysteria gets all of the glory but in my humble opinion this is their best album. Buy it.
1423136802|5.0|I've always loved Mythology, so when I started hearing about these books, I had to get all of them. It's a great series that anybody could read with great characters and a very interesting twist on mythology. I would recommend this series to anybody who loves fantasy
1616960922|4.0|Brandon Sanderson is probably one of my favorite authors. His books always are unique and his magic systems are never the same. His stories always have a flair of originality to them. Having said this this is not my favorite book he has ever written. First I wish it was longer and more of the characters had been developed other than just the main character. The book is short. It is only a little over 200 pages long. Still he manages to weave an excellent tale, we really get to know the main character, though I still feel like there was more we could have learned, and as always Brandon Sanderson had me turning the pages until I was done. If you are a Brandon Sanderson fan then this is worth reading just be prepared for a short ride.
0345529057|2.0|Hey, guys.<br />I'd like to thank you, Amazon, for delivering the item BEFORE it was suppose to arrive, makes me happy to get it faster. But the problem with &#34;getting&#34; it was that I got it damaged. First of all, the package was really damaged, in my opinion. Not to be an butt-hurt of an customer, but one of the books was damaged also and the cardboard thingy (book holder, or whatever it was) was also broken. I'm not willing to wait another month or two, just get a new product, I'd rather read these, damaged, ones, because I can't wait that long to start reading these precious books. All I could want from Amazon is an explanation why this happened and possibly a compensation. (a new book [the first one])<br />FYI,seems to me,like somebody shot my package with a BB Gun. If anyone wants some pictures as proof- inform me, I will send them to you or just upload them somewhere.<br />  Peteeee.
B000001E21|3.0|This is not def leppard's best album but it still has some really good songs on it. If you are a def leppard fan then you should own this. If not then this is not for you.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Since the updated the game doesn't go past the downloading screen with a lot of minions as a background. Please fix it!
B000001FKY|4.0|Pour some sugar on me... i hate that song but it is the song that everyone knows and loves by Def Leppard. it is on this album so that makes this the most popular of the Def Leppard Albums. This album does have some great songs on it and it is very solid. If you like Def leppard then you already have this album i'm betting. if you want to try a def leppard album try Adrenalized instead.
B00005JPD0|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. Denzel, no matter what movie he plays in, does not play the character; he IS the character. In my opinion there is no finer actor than he is. I hope he entertains us for many years to come. Thanks, Denzel, wherever you are...
0307010856|5.0|If you don't like this book you don't have a soul. This is by far my favorite book from childhood. Every child should own a copy of this book, mr brown can moo can you, and if you give a mouse a cookie. If you do not own this book... what is the matter with you? Go buy a copy right NOW!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So addicting when you connect to Facebook you can challenge your friends and see who gets the higher score! And you get rewarded if your first of all your friends!(:
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I loved Everwood. The acting was fantastic and the characters you fall in love with. If you have never watched this show, and you have a heart, you really should watch it. This show was over looked at the time being on a smaller struggling network. This show had charm.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows ever! So addicting. Great acting and suspense. Can't wait for more. Hope it never ends.
B000067FP8|4.0|I loved Gremlins as a child. Gizmo is so adorable how could you not. Where this movie is not quite as good as the first I always liked the fact that they added a bit of variety to the Gremlins in this movie. It still holds up after all these years. I have always wondered why they never made a Gremlins 3.
B00CJ32S74|4.0|The soundtrack really doesn't match the movie era. However, it is very good music. I already owned the Jack Black rendition of the U2 song and bought it anyway.
B000006Y4E|4.0|I did not like &#34;On through the Nite&#34;. It was High N Dry that Def leppard really found their sound. This album is great and should be appreciated by all rock and roll fans.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I would have preferred a different ending, but the storyline was still very touching. I would definitely recommend this book.
B003Y5H4Y8|2.0|I understand what it would be like to spend ten days stuck in an apartment. It's a lot like this movie. Find out for yourself!
034580404X|5.0|I bought all three together somI did not have to wait so long to read the next book. I understand what akll the hype was about.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Both me and my husband enjoyed this game. We can not wait form more rooms. Let us know when there is more to challenge us. Thanks.
0978545095|5.0|No one book could completely embrace the depth of Maier's work. The collection in this book is an impressive representation of her talent.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|I can't do this album justice with words. Buy multiple copies and hand them out to people. Change some lives.
B004FEFS5E|4.0|The only part I did not understand is when the author gives the settings for aperture and shutter speed but skips the ISO. Is it because he sets it at Auto or he sets it at 100-200? Could someone explain that to me?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I give this 4 mustachios up!<br />a good way to pass some time and test your memory of shapes and colors
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We love this game. I downloaded this for my 3year old and she love it. And yes I have to admit I am now hooked on this game. We fight over who gets to play first. Love the new locations they added. Keep them coming. Awesome game and totally worth the time to download and play.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Finally, an app that lets me sort, search and even check my spam box. And it's free! Can't get any better. the alert feature even works works, which is more than what others can say.
0786856297|5.0|Tear his is a wonderful series!  My 12 year old grandson read it and now it has been read by his 8 year old brother, 10 year old cousin and his mom, aunts, grandma and grandpa.  Fun having a series of books the whole family enjoyed and can discuss!  Not too many series can say that!
B00009NHC5|5.0|Audrey Hepburn in a wonderfully suspenseful drama that moves along at a good clip and leaves you breathless by the end.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|The game is awesome in so many ways. I haven't been addictive to a TD game in a long time. One problem I had with TD games you can usually spam one tower to get a perfect game but not this one. It makes you think and sometimes pleasantly frustrates you to make you rethink in a good way (trying not to let one baddy cross the line). The replay value is high in the fact that each board has three modes to play good modes where you want to play the extra modes. Some towers you even interact with on the fly so your not just watching the action your in it. The way every thing looks and the sound draws you in a definite plus. It has a buy option to make it easier but is not needed and will actually take away from the game if you spend more money on it so it's a bad thing but it's a great thing because it's a full game you don't need to spend. One flaw they have these abilities wich you spend crystals on to get over powering stuff (crystals is earned by playing the game or buying which you won't need because crystals are easily obtained by just play in).I could go on about so much more it's that good but I'll end my review here.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so fun they should really make a subway surfed Hawaii because thats were surfing started.(:
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is the best TV series ever aired!  I can't wait for season 4 and hope it will continue for a very long time.
B00BGZ8TVA|1.0|I HATE this movie! NO SPOILERS! Notice that I didn't use the past tense, hated, but the present tense, hate. My loathing of this film is an active and ongoing thing. Life of Pi starts off nicely enough with an interesting story that you think is going in one direction and then whip lashes you in another... Fair enough I suppose, I don't mind being surprised. What offended me the most was the extreme violence depicted in the film. Had I lived back in the days of the Roman Empire, I would NOT have been front row center when they brought the animals out for slaughter. Yet, for the entire second half of the movie, we are asked to sit and watch the surviving animals from a shipwreck kill and eat one another in a tiny lifeboat. If you've seen the film you'll know that it's all OK because of the twist ending. I found the computer generated imagery to be sadly lacking and the entire movie feels like a sick trick that is played on the viewer. I HATE THIS MOVIE!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I love this movie so much that I basically do the cup song all the time! great to watch with friends!!!!
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|AWFUL, BORING, DULL and MONOTONOUS! You would think that with a stellar cast like Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston Albert Brooks and Ron Pearlman, that this would have been an enjoyable film, but sadly no... When you combine bad writing, stale cinematography and an irritating 80's synthesizer soundtrack, you end up with this BS. I feel bad for everyone involved with this motion picture, but mostly, I feel bad for anyone who buys it and expects that this will be some kind of exciting movie. THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE!!!
B008JFURKG|4.0|\\"Red 2\\" is an even bigger and better comedy action thriller than 2010's \\"Red\\", featuring everyone's favorite \\"retired-extremely dangerous\\" spies.  A superb cast has a blast with the plot and the dialogue as the action runs from Kansas to Washington DC to Paris to London to Moscow.<br /><br />Retired spy Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is attempting to live a quiet life with girlfriend Sarah (Mary Louise Parker) in Kansas.  Old and very paranoid friend Marvin (John Malkovich) warns them of the resurrection of a mysterious Cold War plot known as Operation NIGHTSHADE.  Marvin disappears in a car explosion and Frank is taken in for interrogation by the CIA's nasty Jack Horton (Neal McDonough).  Frank will of course escape and go on the run with Sarah and the resilient Marvin.<br /><br />It will turn out that the answers to NIGHTSHADE are inside the head of Dr. Edward Bailey (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant but deranged scientist held incommunicado by Britain's MI-6 for the last thirty years.  Frank, already wanted by the CIA, MI-6, and the KGB, will also have to contend with a paid assassin named Han (Byung-Hun Lee).  He will get help from a former MI-6 operative (Helen Mirren), a former Russian spymaster (Brian Cox), and a former KGB agent and ex-lover (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  Together, they will have to find a reclusive information peddler known as the Frog, sneak into a high security detention area, and break into, and out of, the Kremlin.  The action and suspense are virtually non-stop, and if the plot doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense, it's all tongue-in-cheek good fun, well done by a group of talented actors with impeccable comedic timing.  Recommended as an afternoon's good entertainment.
B005FISBTO|1.0|Dexter Season 6, what the hell happened to my show? SPOILER ALERT! So now Dexter's sister Deb suddenly realizes that she loves her brother, oh no, not just loves him; but LOVES him... I just think I'm gonna barf! Come on writers! Deb is a hard -nosed, no nonsense detective, she would have a highly developed sense of morality and I can tell you as someone who was adopted with an adopted sister, you don't fall in love with your sister after it's revealed that she was really adopted, if you're a normal person. Hello, Deb is supposed to be the NORMAL sibling in this relationship...right? You expect weird and abnormal behavior from Dexter, he's a psychopath after all, but I mean COME ON! Besides that disgusting and illogical plot twist, I thought the writing and directing was weak in season 6. I felt none of the suspense or creepiness that typified the earlier seasons, which I LOVED. Colin Hanks is a good actor, but he lacks the gravitas to carry off the complex emotions that were needed to bring off the DDK killer, I just didn't buy it. The writers also have overly contrived plots twists and stale devices that I never saw in the earlier seasons. Sad to say, someone killed one of my favorite shows. If you're a fan of Dexter, Seasons 1-5, skip season 6!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A solid and detailed read. It will keep you up late reading and wanting more. Truly worth your time and money.
B000ASATYO|1.0|I HATED THIS MOVIE and I really expected to like it, especially after seeing Heavenly Creatures, King Kong and the LOTR movies, I figured that this would be yet another fantastic film from Uber Director Peter Jackson....Eh, not so much. This movie is TERRIBLE, it's LOUD and it is ANNOYING. The film starts off OK, I bought the premise that Michael J. Fox's character could (SPOILER ALERT) see ghosts and even work with them to scam people with his Ghost-Busters type spirit removal service, but The Frighteners very quickly falls apart after the first 30 minutes. Fox's character is a scam artist, and he bumbles and stumbles WAY too much to be taken as a real person. I really can't stand it when movie makers try to make a Comedy/Horror film, for me, the two genres just don't belong in the same film. Look, either make me laugh or give me a fright, but don't try to do both because it doesn't work and I just end up feeling manipulated. Jeffrey Coombs scatter-brained FBI Agent character is the most irritating character in movie history, next to Robin Williams in the equally bad film Toys. By the time this POS was reaching the lame climax, I actually thought about hitting the eject button, but I wanted to see if Jackson was going to go for the obvious, predictable ending, and he did! In the future, whenever I hear someone talk about a film that has fantastic special effects, but still sucks, I will think of The Frighteners.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|this game is hard to figure out when you first start playing it.  But other than that 5 stars. Cool Game.
B0090EHVMC|1.0|Great message, BAD movie. Dr Seuss stories almost never turn out to be good movies, so why does Hollywood insist on trying to pad out a 10 minute children's story into a 90 minute movie? The film has an environmental message but it's so on the nose and over the top that I found myself rolling my eyes and checking the clock. I hate to be hard on this movie because I love Dr. Seuss, but this mess is NOT what the good Dr. intended. The songs are an unbearable mix of pseudo-rock-pop, the direction was all over the boards, this is a train-wreck of a movie. I can't see anyone but a four year old liking it, and a very unsophisticated four year old at that. Skip this pile and watch Avatar again...
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is easy to navigate with flip book style pages and no nonsense features. I have found that the few ads are very slightly distracting and find no need to buy the full version. I gave it 4 stars only because of the ads and the radar map doesn't have visible cloud cover. The radar map is very high quality and may be changeable but I have not found out how. The severe weather alert tone is also a great feature.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|I loved this book.  It was written in beautiful, lyrical prose with rich characters and many twists and surprises.  I am easily bored by most of today's writers, but Gaiman is a master storyteller with an extraordinary imagination.
B008Y73940|5.0|Matthew McConaughey is one of my favorite actors.  The plot of Lincoln Lawyer was very different.<br />Like new plots. Have to admit, we have some young writers, directors, etc. doing very well.<br /><br />Jean Bolin Teste
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This is not an easy book to read due to the multiple story lines that intersect and connect. Some of these are so much on the side of the main story, it's hard to keep reading. The constant shifting from one narrator to another, and one point of view to another, was not fun.<br />What we really want is to get the brother and sister back together, and when it finally happens, it is so unsatisfying! At least the two women names Pari complete that circle which both of them need to have completed.<br />What do you take away from this book? That family really, really matters in our lives. It is not country or culture, both of which are pretty much lost through time for the main characters. But the family relationships we had, have and will have are extremely important and shape our lives, even when we don't want them to.<br />It was interesting to see into the heart of Afghanistan, how Afghans view the Taliban's terrorism, and how Islamic law treats women. It was nice to see that women can walk far enough away from all these and become the people they need to, unencumbered with cultural/religious issues that take them down.<br />It is just so sad to see what a third world country Afghanistan still is. This book is set in fairly recent times. A sad, wasteland. At least as Hosseini portrays it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app works excellent, especially when I don't have access to a computer and need to contact someone. Really helpful.
0143036424|5.0|Haven't read the book yet, but impressed with the condition of the paperback and the timeliness of receiving it following the order.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids have played this so much  my phone my husband downloaded it and we downloaded it on the kindle.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|While &#34;Memory&#34; did present a solid, must anticipated ending to this amazing series, I admit that I was a little disappointed.  The writing style was great and I must say that Sanderson's writing is much smoother than Jordan's was.  After spending so many years with these characters, I anticipated an emotional parting of ways and instead I walked away feeling underwhelmed.  For me, there was no great epiphany, no moment of clarity where everything came together for me.  I was hoping to be dazzled and I ended up just feeling relief that it was finally over.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My kids love playing this game for hours and hours. They love the challenges and the little funny things the characters do.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I had a hard time getting into this book. The first 25 pages or so were  a drag. After that, the book picked up and I enjoyed th book.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|My son loves playing this game. My daughter not so much so she has different games. He loves the challenge and the graphics. Great game.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|Works perfect and almost noiseless. Worth my money. Recommend this product to anyone out there. Hope this was helpful to anyone out there.
B009POCG2C|5.0|But of course I bought it because Clint Eastwood's name was on it everywhere... Never been disappointed in anything he's done, be it old cowboy dusters, directorial efforts. Anything he chooses to do is a quality production. He has so many strings to his bow. Story keeps your interest and doesn't drag. These days I just buy anything he does, and next will be all the Jazz films...
B008TRH5N6|5.0|I love this book, I love everything about it, the teaching is great and really inspiring. But even more than that, it made me feel good all the time i was reading, I will definitively read it many times.
B002QXI2L8|1.0|Is this really &#34;the music&#34; of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice or his Orphee et Eurydice? I was expecting a modern dance to accompany Gluck's instrumental and vocal setting of either the original Italian libretto of Calzabigi or his later setting of the French libretto of Moline.<br /><br />That it is sung in German should have been a tip off to me that I was not going to be getting either version of Gluck's reformed Baroque opera, but I didn't pay close enough attention to that detail when ordering this DVD. The printed material that comes with the DVD doesn't help me figure out what libretto is being used. Based on the German title and the use of German throughout, I'm wondering if it isn't the German play by Kokoschka which Krenek set as Orpheus und Eurydike.<br /><br />In any case, to my untrained ears the singing sounds closer to a mash-up of Beethoven's Fidelio and Wagner's Das Rheingold. To this untrained listener the singing is in no way remotely Baroque, however reformed. The only way I could tolerate watching the dance is with the sound turned off. So labeling this as &#34;music by Gluck&#34; seems misleading, even if it follows Gluck's orchestration.<br /><br />Maybe another reviewer could explain what is going on here. In any case, Baroque opera fans beware!
B0019O6IWU|5.0|This is a book that will change the way I communicate with people... The concept is easy, we have been raised to judge each other, to find the fault in ourselves and in others and that contribute to the violence in this world.<br />In this book, Mr Rosenberg shows us how to connect with our feelings and needs and to express them and to connect with peoples feelings and needs and emphasize with them. I would love that everybody read this book. If there is only one chance that we would change the world, that would be it.
0471267554|5.0|I have been stuck in the dreaded plateau for months now. I lost about 16 pounds this year from cutting out meat and eating clean, but I was stuck in the 138-140 pound area. I tried the Shred diet, but it was torturous, and it was hard for me to believe that eating that many carbs was good for dieting (a cup and a half of oats with two pieces of bread in the morning?!). I tried eating way more protein to gain muscle and burn fat, but that had little to no results as well.<br /><br />So, I started reading about gluten-free and diets that incorporated no grains, and I came across the popular Paleo Diet. No joke, after 3 days of doing the Paleo diet, I dropped 3 pounds! I haven't seen the number 136 in years! I can't believe how quickly I dropped weight, not to mention that I feel AMAZING and energetic when I am not eating grains, sugar, dairy, or salt! It can be kind of difficult to figure out what to eat, but it definitely forces you to consume way more vegetables and fruits instead of chips or sugary things which is great! I eat a lot of fish so this diet works great for me.<br /><br />I recommend buying this book or even searching online for how to do the Paleo diet. You will NOT regret it!
B004RXKJ16|5.0|But some words were nowhere to be found as I was reading Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov. Overall it's inclusion of various jargon makes it interesting to flip through during my free time
0393024415|5.0|Easy to read, practical examples you can apply right away. Authors not only tell you to acknowledge feelings, but also teach you exactly how to do it.
B004LY8KG2|3.0|This is pretty much let the right one in redone with different actors, the original was better but the dubs were awful. if you can handle reading subs I would get the original. if you need English audio I would recommend this version.
B00932DCS8|3.0|The story was great, but I don't see well enough or read fast enough to keep up with what's going on.  I missed a lot of scenes trying to read the subtitles.  I guess I don't do well with subtitled movies.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like title said. it's free do I need to say more! Ok thank you for the free app.nice feel and grafits nice and clear best game app so far
B005G48Y58|5.0|I have not read this story, but I  was very pleasantly surprised with Saoirse's performance.  Some things are hard to believe in most movies and Kate Blanchet's ability to be anywhere at any time was one of those especially during the final scenes.  Unbelievable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|They must be really desperate for people to play because it takes forever to get the characters but it is a fun game to play besides moviestatplanet it's the only game I play
B00CWV8X04|4.0|This was an unexpected surprise.  It took me a while to figure out the conspiracy thread, but I think Roony started to give it away somewhat early on.  Jude Law is one of my heroes for several of his movies.  I though it was suspenseful, intriguing, and well directed.  The cast was the best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like everything about it ....! best part is the graphics, it pops out like real life and how points are collected.....hours of fun!
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Love this cd. FFDP never disappoints! Not only are they great musicians but amazing people in general. This cd is by far one of their best and I can't stop listening. Can't wait for Vol. 2!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the best book i have ever read I love it and I think it deserves a lot more ratings.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This is a fantastic movie that made me laugh out loud. I dont really rate stuff, but this was so deserving!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|It's a nice case with the stand option. Easy to carry and keep clean. Also like the strap option on the case
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Nothing different than so many murder mysteries .acting is fine predictable movements and screen play.<br />Ok time pass.  Nothing much for other cha rectors
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I loved it, but it started to get predictable as it ended, and I regret that. I loved the story though.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed Cheryl Strayed's WILD (FROM LOST TO FOUND ON THE PACIFIC CREST TRAIL). As the spouse of an Appalachian Trail hiker, I could relate...albeit vicariously! She is an excellent writer and this was a great first selection for our fledgling book club.<br /><br />Don't be frightened away by the thought of reading a book about hiking; it is so much more than that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is awesome but is you down and jump and u have a shield on after u down and jump your shield will be in the floor and it works for the magnet to but rather then that it is a awesome game any should get it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had trouble envisioning a book about a teenager with cancer that could work. I was wrong. I laughed while I was crying. I laughed out loud while weeping on my reading device. I had to wipe my eyes to see the print, but i didn't find this book depressing at all. In fact i found it healing. This book is awfully funny while being funny about the awful. This book captures many true things. The isolation of illness, it's petty humiliations, and it's giant ones. The need to be seen that we humans share, the desire to make a difference that some of us have. The desire be remembered. The immediacy of terminal illness. The magic of first love.<br /><br />I could give a plot synopsis, but the discoveries are part of the delight here. Suffice it to say this book is a about a teenage girl with a terminal illness. It doesn't minimize the pain of illness. It manages the incredible by not sentimentalizing it. I don't know if this book is written because of life experience, but it rang true in many ways. This kind of truth does not come cheap.<br /><br />An excellent, exceptional book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game. One thing I do not is how it changed from Subway Surfer Paris edition to somewhere in China I do not remember the name of. But other than that I like the game. It's not my favorite game but it is however one of my games I play a lot.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. Natalie Portman plays twelve year old Mathilda, whose abusive parents are slaughtered by DEA psycho bad cop Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his men. Mathilda is saved by neighbor Leon (Jean Reno) who tricks them by letting Mathilda into his apartment. Mathilda learns that Leon is a hit man, and begs him to teach her the trade. Loner hard-case Leon discovers he has a soft-spot for the precocious little one, and becomes her mentor. Mathilda falls in love with Leon, which provides many amusing scenes due to Leon's hilarious reactions. This movie is better than its American counterpart because it shows Mathilda actually assisting in Leon's hits, making the storyline even more believable. The final confrontation between Stansfield and Leon is a classic. One of Hollywood's greatest tragedies is the absence of a sequel to this movie.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Well developed cast of characters; interesting magical model; rich and detailed world build-out with a complex and evolving lore. Highly recommended.
044022425X|5.0|rst read Drums of Autumn about 3 years ago. At the time, I remember not being as into it as the first three books. In fact, my attention began to wane at about 3 quarters of the way through Voyager if truth be told. However, upon my second read through of Drums of Autumn, I rediscovered my love for this amazing series. I do not know how I ever thought this book was slow or boring before. Granted, the beginning of the book takes some time to set up and build momentum, but once the foundation is laid the pace picks up rapidly and spins faster and faster until we reach the end.<br /><br />Some things I really enjoyed about Drums: I absolutely fell in love with wee Ian. I liked him before. He and Jamie have always had a special bond since the day Ian was born and Jamie was forced to hide in the wardrobe as red coats ransacked the house, Jenny having just given birth. Wee Ian sucks Jamie's finger contentedly and from then on the two were bonded for life. In this installment, wee Ian really \\"isna verra wee\\" anymore. In fact, Ian is growing up fast! He is sensitive and intuitive. He counseled Claire to comfort Jamie. He recognizes Willie for who he really is to Jamie. He offers a proposal to Bree, and lastly, without giving too much away, he completely \\"saves the day.\\" Another part I loved was the scene with Claire, the bear, Jamie and the fish! Lastly, I loved Roger. While I didn't really care one way or the other about Roger my first read through, the second time I read this book, I found myself swooning over Roger. He is a first rate gentleman and it is very interesting to see a 21sr century man of noble character and honor and fortitude pitted against an 18th century man of the same character. Jamie and Roger are alike, but very different. I like that Roger finally stands up (well sort of stands up) to Jamie.<br /><br />Some things I didn't like about Drums of Autumn: Jamie is no longer a young man, as evident when Claire finds him face down in the snow, unable to movebecause he has \\"thrown out\\" his back. This was actually a heart breaking discovery for me. I knew intellectually that Jamie was no longer a young 20 something year old, but I did not fully grasp the concept until that moment. I didn't like that every major mishap was due to some misunderstand or misinformation via Brianna. How frustrating. This girl IS trouble, as her name suggests.<br />Overall, I gave this book 5 stars because of its artful prose and masterpiece plot which is part tragic and often times hilarious and rarely dull. Gabaldon has a way of making you not know whether to laugh, sigh or cry. I am excitedly looking forward to Book #5: The Fiery Cross.
B005J4TLN4|2.0|If you're tired of movies that have protagonists with no redeeming qualities, stay away from this one. It's very hard to relate to - or even like - the main group of characters. \\"Attack the Block\\" starts with a gang of young thugs mugging a lady who turns out to be one of their neighbours.  Then, when the trouble hits, they bully her into helping them.  Sadly, their behaviour doesn't get any better as the movie goes along.<br /><br />The script tries to push moments of empathy on its audience by showing us the home life of these little jerks, as if to excuse their bad behaviour.  Those \\"poor me\\" moments irritated me.  We can't blame other people or circumstances for the choices we make, yet that is exactly what this movie wants us to do.  Sorry, but being raised by a grandparent or living in a low-income area doesn't give anyone a free pass to be a criminal.<br /><br />Even the clich&eacute;d and obvious ending was meant to manipulate the viewer into feeling better about the \\"hero\\" being such a worthless creep; \\"Ahh well, he wasn't all bad.  He sacrificed himself to save the world!\\"  I was so turned off by these little punks - er, protagonists - that I didn't remember any of their names throughout the movie and was glad to see most of them get wiped out by the aliens.<br /><br />The only reason this gets 2 stars is that the FX were actually really well done.  Other than that, I felt cheated by this movie.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|I got this game as a free app from amazon.<br />t had only 2 or 3 reviews and its sale price in my opinion was kinda high. So, I decided to check it out because I love finding hidden gems .<br />And this is one.<br /><br />The graphics are smooth, cute and on point.<br /><br />The game play is simple and the puzzles will give you pause.<br /><br />If I had paid for this game, even at 2.99$ I would have been happy.<br /><br />This is a great little game. Im glad I took the chance and I hope to see more like this in the future from them.
B001C3I4UM|5.0|Start of some really great 60's music by The Moody Blues in their long and multi-faceted careers. It's a must.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|A fun challenging game that is well worth the download.<br />Game play is simple, but the puzzles are not. Graphics are smooth and it looks really good.
B001C3L32I|5.0|Had a house fire and lost this on cd(amounst 350 other cd's) ecletic 60's; fine, fine music I am glad to be able to lisen to, again.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Best Series and hate to see it coming to an end this season. I will definitely download and watch the other seasons.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Lots of fun and easy to use and best of all it was free. It's great when you have time to fill and nothing else to do.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Love all kinds of music and this has been lots of fun to use.  Recently I was waiting for my flight at the airport gate and heard a snappy tune which I liked.  I pulled out my cellphone, tapped the shazam and now I know who the artist is and the name of the song.  Great app!  It stores the info on your phone and I think you can purchase the song and download onto your phone with this too....I haven't done that part yet, but I have used the info to research songs and artists on ITunes.
0142422010|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />This book was so good. I loved it. Lola is a fantastic character. Cricket is so endearing. Their romance is well built and timed. The ending is a triumph. Having Anna and St. Clair continue their love story was a nice bonus.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is a great story by Picoult.  I have read nearly all of the authors books.  She is able to write about legal proceedings in a way that allows you to feel for the characters involved. I would definitely recommend this book (and all of her others).
B000I9U8VO|4.0|Fun and exciting. Some of the plot was soft but the action and characters made it fun to watch.  Good for our 12 year old boy and the parents
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had a couple elements that I enjoyed:<br />1) The story was told by several narrators<br />2) There were twists to the story that I could not predict<br /><br />I will be reading other books by this author.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|This was a surprising roll but somewhat disappointing for the charactors that Arnold had played in this years in acting.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Why does this app require that I sign in to my Amazon account to use it?  It was not like that when I first got it as the FAOTD.<br /><br />I do not like that change.  Please fix it so that I can use it without signing in.
B0092QITO2|5.0|Love this movie. So glad it's now part of my permanent collection.  Great price.  The whole family watched and enjoyed this movie
B00C81AVNU|5.0|The new show, Kinky Boots, is an instant hit! The songs are so very infectious. I always find myself humming one of them after listening to the album (It will most likely be one of these songs that get caught in your brain: The Most Beautiful Thing in the World, Step One, Sex is in the Heel, The History of Wrong Guys, Everybody Say Yeah, Soul of a Man, or Raise You Up). But Cyndi Lauper's songs are all great. A great addition to my library of cast albums.
B00AEBB8BA|5.0|Love this movie. So glad it's now part of my permanent collection.  Great price.  The whole family watched and enjoyed this movie

0756404738|5.0|This novel had a lot more expansion into Kvothe's journey into becoming Kote. All of the additional content that progressed the character was very interesting and fun to read. I'm glad he included such character exploration depth it really helped us learn about Kvothe.
0143122061|5.0|Ordered this book for a school (college) assignment. The book itself did not hold my interest because History isn't my thing but it got me through and I got an A in the class. Received the book promptly with no issues. Seller recommended.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|excellent.
0425263924|5.0|Received super quickly. So glad because I had finished book 2 and was dying for 3. LOVED this book!! Now I'm DYING for book 4!! I think I like this series better than 50 Shades.

B008CJ0KEM|5.0|This show is really fun and interesting, with a great cast of characters and some truly unique lore. My personal favorite thing about it is that it's actually got a very strong female lead - and how many truly badass female characters do we get to see?<br /><br />I'd recommend this to people who enjoy shows like Buffy (my all-time favorite show) - shows with a good mix of humor and drama, with likeable and capable characters you can -care- about. This show's got a great first season, as well, because they waste no time - even here there's a lot of foreshadowing and references to bigger events going on behind the scenes, and some big plot threads come in with plenty of time to flesh out and grab your interest. It's got some good writing, even for the standalone episodes - it's impressively good at making you care even about characters that only come in for one episode. As for the main characters, they're extremely well-written and very funny; any scene where they can play off each other is great (and they get plenty of opportunities to do this).<br /><br />All in all this is a show I'd recommend - give it a chance and you'll probably find yourself really happy with it.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|The dvd is great. The only song I missed was the no-no song. His new songs are good & the all stars were great.(Santana,toto,mr.mister,todd rungren) & a surprise guest in joe walsh. Didn't know that walsh is his brother in law...At 72 ringo still puts on a great show.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|amazing.  excellent.  one of the best movies i have ever seen.  brilliant performances by the actors.  really so thought provoking
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love it and all, but it is always trying to get me to by gems.  It is also hard to get your star rating up because if you don't tip people for a while, your star rating goes down. But for a free game, it's pretty good, and besides the company has to make money somehow so they just decided to get people too buy gems.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game and play it every day. I have it on my kindle,  my cell phone and my home computer. 5 stars.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There are no words to truly describe Downton Abby or the 3rd season. You'll be emotionally moved in so many ways. I love this series!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Follows the movie and books ever so slightly, just enough so you can grasp who the characters are but adds so so much more!
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Loved this album from 1995. Really wanted the dvd of old concert footage. Well worth it to see Lange RIP. Songs not released on the 1st album in 1995 on live cd and remastered oringinal.
B008B7OQHM|5.0|Love it, I listen to it at least once a day, one of my all time fav bands! R U 486
0345529057|5.0|Good way to get a broader view of Fire and Ice saga.  Hope it does end sometime, like a good finish.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|I couldn't agree more with the negative reviews of Oprah Winfrey's narration.  I watched this series on television and found Oprah's delivery lacking in spirit.  My brother has the BBC version narrated by David Attenborough, and it's practically a different series with his voice.  I strongly encourage you to find that one, and don't waste your money on this version.
159463176X|5.0|I am so glad I bought this book in hard copy because I want everyone I know to read it. It's difficult for me to believe that an author could write three winners in a row, but I think \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" is the best yet. I won't reiterate the storyline as you can read it above, but so many issues are raised, among them; the power of different types of love; how we might be making life choices based on what we fear more than what we think we want; loyalty and service to others to list a few. This is a book I will definitely recommend to my book groups and friends. It is absolutely excellent.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Jodi Picoult never fails to engage her readers.  As a teacher we students all the time going through being picked on and bullied.  It is so important for us to remember what seems little to adults and what we can brush off is sooooo much more to our little ones.  I will recommend this book to every teacher as a great reminder to love and nurture all our students and to never brush off mean comments as kids just being kids.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This is a great family movie, my family I really enjoyed it!<br />I highly recommend this movie for anyone looking for a movie night movie.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This show's got everything you want - fun enjoyable characters! fun plots! humor! action! and just the right amount of drama.  Too bad there's only one season.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|If you're looking for adventures, secrets, and mind blowing plot twists, you've come to.the.right show. Once Upon a Time is.my favorite show on TV, and i normally don't like keeping up with a series on.TV. It captured my attention from the first epiosde and I've fallen.in.love with it. It has every ones favorite classic fairy tale characters and has a great story line, honestly just click play and you'll love it :)

B00992CF6W|5.0|I Love this game it's fun to play in cars or long trips but you don't get to do everything you do in PC or Xbox
B00CSV7AFC|5.0|I found this band through the newest Assassin's Creed trailer during E3, and I am so glad I did. If you thought their single \\"Full Circle\\" was good, just wait til you hear the rest of the album! Not only is it fantastic, but quite varied. It never feels like I'm listening to the same song over and over, they change up their style constantly. Every song is beautiful and heart-touching. I only wish there were more to listen to!
1419707671|5.0|These encourage my grandson to read and that is more important to me than anything else. Reading is something all children should be encouraged to get involved in.

B00DL47RQ2|5.0|If you want to see this year's master class in screen acting, you need to watch Cate Blanchett's mesmerizing performance as Jasmine French, a delusional Park Avenue socialite wife in Woody Allen's 46th directorial effort, a sly, bicoastal update of Tennessee Williams' classic [[ASIN:B00124LYHQ A Streetcar Named Desire]]. As the film opens, her impeccably dressed character has hit rock bottom after her financial wizard of a husband is arrested and her assets are liquidated. In the throes of a nervous breakdown, she arrives in San Francisco and moves in with her kind-hearted sister Ginger who lives a modest, blue-collar life in a tiny apartment on the edge of the Mission - on South Van Ness near 14th Street to be exact - with her two hyperactive sons. You can tell Jasmine is not only out of her element but quite judgmental about how her sister's life has turned out. The irony of Jasmine's patronizing attitude is that she is a habitual liar who is so angry about her destitute circumstances that she frequently talks to herself. The story follows the basic outline of \\"Streetcar\\" but takes some interesting turns, for instance, when she tries to better herself by taking computer classes while working as a receptionist at a dental office.<br /><br />Allen has crafted his film into a clever juxtaposition of current and past events that feels jarring at first since it reflects Jasmine's precarious mental state but then melds into a dramatic arc which resonates far more than a straightforward chronology could have allowed. As a writer, he has become more vociferous in his dialogue without losing his wit. He doesn't pull punches when he showcases confrontations between his characters, whether it's between the two sisters, men and women, or people from different classes. Hostility can come in flammable torrents or in thinly veiled remarks. That Allen moves so dexterously in tone is a testament to his sharp ability in drawing out the truth in his actors. Blanchett is a wonder in this regard because there is something intensely fearless in her approach. Unafraid to lose audience sympathy for her character, she finds an innate sadness in Jasmine that makes us want to know what happens to her next. She also mines the sharp, class-based humor in Jasmine's struggles with one highlight a hilariously executed scene in a pizza restaurant where she explains to her confused nephews to \\"Tip big, boys\\".<br /><br />The rest of the cast manage effective turns. Alec Baldwin plays Jasmine's swindler husband with almost effortless aplomb. Sally Hawkins brings a wonderful looseness to Ginger, Stella to Blanchett's Blanche, and finds a level of poignancy in her character's constant victimization at the hands of her sister as well as her brutish, blue-collar boyfriend Chili, played with comic fierceness by Bobby Cannavale in the Stanley Kowalski role. In a conveniently conceived role, Peter Sarsgaard gets uncharacteristically breezy as Dwight, a wealthy, erudite, and matrimonially available State Department diplomat who appears to be the answer to Jasmine's prayers, while Allen casts two unlikely comics in about-face roles - Andrew Dice Clay as Ginger's defeated ex-husband Augie and Louis C.K. as Al, an amorous suitor who brings Ginger a few moments of romantic salvation. Allen's European sojourn appears to have freed him up with the movement of characters in scenes and Javier Aguirresarobe's ([[ASIN:B001G9F9IW Vicky Cristina Barcelona]]) camerawork complies nicely. The San Francisco locations bring a nice geographic change to Allen's storytelling, and he only uses the Golden Gate Bridge in a long shot once from the Marin side. This is Allen's best work in quite a while, and Blanchett is the ideal muse for his tale.this regard because there is something intensely fearless in her approach.

0316174483|5.0|Thanks soo much for the book! I looove it! I saw it in the kindergarten where I work, and I wanted one for myself! Lovee it!
0345803493|5.0|This entire Trilogy is an excellent read.  Even though it is a fiction, It demonstrates the effects parents and guardians have on their children and the ramifications of the child's life in general.<br /><br />Also, I received this book in a very timely manner.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Fabulous app and tool.  Not only can I take notes and document meetings, ideas, concepts and thoughts but I can easily share them with colleagues and family members.  I used another app for a while but Evernote is by far a superior tool
B00A993UWM|5.0|The first time I ever saw/heard of Kesha was when I heard her play Tik Tok on the TV.  I remember wondering, &#34;who was that?&#34;  Since then I've been listening to her.  I'm actually into metal and she's the only non-metal show I've been to.  Actually quite a different crowd, I'm not gonna go into the differences.  Anyways the show was entertaining and very sexual in nature.  And so are her songs, which is why I can see the interest in her with many of the youths. My interest as well...In her show she performs a lot on her own as an instrumental artist, not just singing and dancing like most of this style &#34;pop&#34; music.  Her songs are quite poppy,  obviously, but they are different that the norm.  I love the hard hitting beats and just her style of singing.  I am a man and I know a lot of her song are about boys and stuff like that, but I don't listen to music for the lyrics.  Like I said, I listen to metal so I don't understand most the lyrics anyways.  I listen to music as a whole, the way the keyboard, beats, singing, etc. and everything flow together and make you feel.  She can sing about loving boys and sticking things in her anus, which she does, and I wouldn't care.  I hear her music all together as one, one form of art and feeling where I can feel the bass slam my back as I listen to her in my car.
B00005R2IS|4.0|This has some good scenes from the Mad Max trilogy and helped complete my collection. It has a definite place on my movie shelf.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Enjoyed this book tremendously<br />Found subject matter fascinating and Piper a most complex character, quirky yet likeable.  Would recommend to my book club.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Starlink is a great fast to play game, which you can play in as little as 10 minutes.  The basic concept is to capture a majority (all) of the stars on the map.  Each system has (potentially) different properties, and your profile &#34;levels up&#34; as you gain experience, which allows you to buy special abilities prior to each map.<br /><br />Overall a very decent game, that performs well even on low end Android HW (nook color, running CM 10).
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cute game that is hard to put down. Very realistic graphics. Looking forward to higher levels to see what competitions come up.

Anyone who questions our history, and those who have sparked ideas of time travel will thoroughly enjoy this one!!

B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Orphan Black is one of the best shows on television these days. The story is fresh and interesting. Tatiana Malsany is nothing short of amazing. You have to see her performance in this series to witness acting at its very best.
B009NPK1IO|4.0|A very packed last episode -- so many weddings, a death, betrayal, an unveiling of THE Gossip Girl, a birth of an heir. Good jeez!<br /><br />But, of course, the fashion is impeccable, the money and class is in everything -- and that is enough to forgive the tackiness of the plot.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Good game, I really like hidden object games, looking forward to the next game in this series. really good graphics.
B001AITH50|5.0|Stellar performances by all main actors! The atmospheric moodiness that inspired many other mythical-monster movies. This one is a good go-to vampire flick to see -- it never disappoints. Anne Rice herself has sung it praises, so who am I to disagree?!
B0086213XW|4.0|I thought Michelle Williams was amazing. She can carry any movie. I also thought the photography was beautiful.  I didn't think slow at all.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I HAVE BEEN A STAR TREK FAN SINCE WHEN IT FIRST WAS SHOWN ON TV! I LOVE IT TOTALLY! IT IS AWESOME. I ESPECIALLY LIKE LEONARD NIMOY AND NICHELLE NICHOLS!
B00001IVOR|5.0|One Of The Classics in my book,Wu-Revolution!!! is one of the best along with Reunited!!!,For Heaven Sake!!!,Visionz{Meth predicted 911 on this tracc}Older Gods!!!,It's Yours,The Intro ta the 2nd disc,Deadly Melody,The City!!!,The Projects,The M.G.M.!!!,Dog S***{R-I-P ODB},Heartz is crazy!!!,Second & Closing.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The character development was excellent, and by the end of the novel you were wishing Gaiman was more prolific.  Perhaps another novel with the main character older?
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This was a great series.  Can't wait for season 2 to come out.  Definitely one of the best written shows.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Couldn't put this book down it was so good! The ending really surprised me. Flynn is a great writer. Excellent! : - )
B0000067L2|5.0|Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, and Ginger Baker.  What more needs to be said.  Classic rock that makes you swirl with the beat.  No need to get high, just listen to the music.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This series is fantastic although not for children. I liked so much that even  Pre-ordered Season 3 even though it will not be released until 24-28 Feb 2014.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Madonna knows how to put on a show and this tour is one of her greatest.  Cannot wait to see this in Blu-Ray
160774273X|5.0|I&#34;ve been baking for some years now, mostly breads.  I've learned to use 'autolyse', extended rising in the refrigerator, etc. - just to give some idea of where I'm at.  This book had some new to me ideas that have improved my breads, especially about dough handling techniques.  Also, baking in a preheated dutch oven (every bread in the book is baked that way), is very interesting.  Good book to extend/expand your knowledge - and would be a great way to start out as well.
B004GGM444|5.0|one of the best dub-step albums imo. great for fast paced beats and bass. will definitely recommend to anyone interested in dub-step.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|These caps replace factory rear lens caps for Nikon and work perfectly.  I like to always have a backup.  Would certainly recommend if you are looking for a replacement rear lens cap.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I took this book with me on a camping trip thinking that it would last me the week. After an hour of reading I knew that it would be done the next day. Flynn puts so many twists into this book you will not be able to get enough of it.
0060775858|5.0|This book was a favorite of my children when they were young. I just bought 2 more for friends that are having their first children. A classic!
B00AQCMK32|5.0|Great little game. It has many nuances to keep you thinking for many hours.  I played this 6 hours straight when i first got it!
B00BHC5P1O|5.0|A logical twist in a story line for which there was enough foreshadowing to have it all make sense and be engaging fun. (Unlike, you know, the season 2 finale.)
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I title this season (5) CASTLES AND QUEENS because I think the primary actor (Nathan Fillion) and actress (Stana Katic) are virtually king and queen of the murder, comedy, and melodrama series<br />on TV and I include BONES, THE MENTALIST along with CASTLE.  All 3 shows are excellent but seem to follow similar story lines.  I have all the episodes of the three shows on DVD or video libraries (from AMAZON of course!) and they all have their virtues and vices.  But Beckett is so charming and hot, one wonders why Castle took so long to get together with her.  It does seem  that all the women (Bones, Beckett and Lizbon) have walls built around them fearing to get to close to anyone.  They all have problems in their childhood perhaps that caused these walls to be built.<br />  In this season we have quite a variety of story lines, from Alexi being kidnapped (two part episode) to mocking STAR TREK, to romantic interludes, Castle being framed, and poking fun and horror<br />stories.  Like the other shows these five seasons has a great supporting cast (Ryan and Esposito) and a nasty female boss who for some odd reason wants to be addressed as \\"sir\\".  And like other shows<br />there are very obnoxious people, specifically Castles mother: arrogant, a moocher and a big spender (of Castles money).  She reminds me of that old hag in \\"SUNSET STRIP\\" who dreamt of making a comeback in movies: \\"I'm ready for my closeup, Mr DeMille!\\"  She repels me like Dr Sweets in BONES, a lousy actor who doesn't know the first thing about psychology!<br />  But overall, an excellent, very entertaining series with superb acting, fine photography and gooey special effects.  I noticed the gooeyness seems to gotten more messy from the earlier series: influenced by BONES perhaps.  Some excellent aerial shots of Manhattan, though I live in NYC I haven't been to Manhattan in some years.  I put Stana Katic right up there with Emily Deschanel and<br />Robin Tunney as the \\"Persons I would most like to meet!!\\". Lovely, sexy and great actresses to boot. Live long and Prosper, CASTLE!
B008M87GJK|4.0|Required? Ok, we need to start with manners.<br />I really do not have much time here, but will say that I am a little tired of tv news and their preoccupation with celebs and insignificant trials that dominate that media in this country. Have always preferred bbc for better and more objective coverage of more important subjects, and now can choose what I want on my new Kendall without the distraction of stupid and and noisy commercials that fill half of tv news programs. Anyway.....
B00B7FXZQS|3.0|Not a bad movie with good scary scenes but it does not live up to first couple of Paranormal Activity movies.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I hav a blast playing this game. I hav RA an this entertanes me when I'm down. So I hope you will hav fun too.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I ate, slept and breathed SOA for 10 days catching up with Seasons 1-4.  Gotta love SOA!  How I missed knowing about it for four years (only started watching Season 5) is one of my life's great mysteries.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Few words can describe how incredible this book is. I felt like I was there, seeing Gus's blue eyes and breathing through the cannula. The best way I can describe it is this: \\"Okay? .... Okay.\\"
B0063GORYU|4.0|Have used this game for some time and was happy to be able to get it on my newest computer
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|The DVD with this chilling thriller displayed superior visual and audio quality. This &#34;Mother Nature strikes back&#34; movie in the form of bird attacks featured an all star cast. Novice actress (at the time) Suzanne Pleshette ( The Bob Newhart Show ), rendered a remarkable performance as the town schoolteacher. Tippi Hedren and Jessica Tandy also performed superbly. Even young Veronica Cartwright ( Sound of Music, Lost in Space ), acted well. The beautiful scenery contrasted with bloody bird clawings was enhanced by HD capacity. If you love creature features that terrify, you'll love this Alfred Hitchcock favorite.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|I'm highly introverted so that's all i'm gonna say.<br /><br />oh, there's a twenty word minimum.<br /><br />another example for theextroverted oriented world we live in!
0060936223|3.0|Patty Smith had a very unusual and interesting life.  Unfortunately she is more talented at name dropping than story telling.  I found the book to be dry to the point of being tiresome in some places.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book is dirty good. Lives up to expectations. Maybe one of the best books I've ever read. Can't wait to read the rest
B0084MVEJC|4.0|Richard & Linda Thompson came from the renowned group, &#34;Fairport Convention.&#34; Their contemporary & traditional folk music is absolutely superb & among the best you will ever hear, & deserves a place on everybody's shelves...
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The book really holds your interest. Since there are recent actual events in Ohio, where 3 girls were kidnapped for years, made the \\"ROOM\\" much more interesting. It took a while to figure out what was going on.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is an excellent book to help you get started on publishing an Ebook for Kindle.<br />The author reviews all of the details you will need for formatting and getting your<br />work into publishable condition according to the KDP requirements. The most fun<br />for me was choosing a cover for my work.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Not a bad little sharpener I would not put a $100 knife through it but to sharpen up cheapo knives you have around the house this put a pretty good edge on them.
B00CA4S3LW|5.0|Wow! Amazing! Sorry to say I never listened to \\"Blackmore's Night\\" before now, thus depriving myself from experiencing Richie's musical expertise from a different direction. Yup, I figured \\"it ain't rock, it ain't Rainbow, it ain't Deep Purple, it can't be good\\". DUMB ME! Was I ever WRONG! This is great stuff, and I owe Richie Blackmore and Candice Night (and fans of Blackmore's Night\\") a profound apology!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Addictive, lots of fun. Wish bingo credits could be purchased with the bingo coins you win. Fast moving game, a blast.
B00466HM28|5.0|this is my first Midi Keyboard and its amazing the pads are sick and i'm liking the built in arpeggiator
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I purchased the Chromecast from Google Play on 7/24 and received it yesterday. I've only had it hooked up for 24 hours, so my review is likely to change.<br /><br />Good: really easy to watch youtube and netflix videos from your laptop on TV, can still use other tabs in your Chrome browser while the video is playing, can send your desktop or pictures to the TV also.<br /><br />Bad: limited video formats supported, doesn't work with vimeo or a few other video websites I tried last night (choppy play).<br /><br />If you already have something that plays Netflix/Youtube videos, don't buy the Chromecast just yet unless you really want it. I'm still using the Roku XS for Netflix as it has a wired connection to my internet and I don't have to use my laptop. There are other reasonably priced streaming devices available on the market, it will not replace the main devices I currently use (HDMI cable from laptop to TV, Xbox 360 for Youtube app, Roku XS for Netflix/Hulu/Amazon).
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very addictive, and fun game! You will have fun and you won't notice when you are running faster.......challenging.<br /><br />Play with your friends!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read The Kite Runner twice and A Thousand Suns once and I have loved this book just as much if not more.  I especially liked the style of writing where the character is telling a story.  Then it is interesting how the author weaves the stories together bringing the characters in relationship with each other.  I have gained a better perspective of life in Afghanistan and how the ordinary people survived the changes that have occurred in that country.  I look forward to other books by this author.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a reallly addicting game you'll get hooked! I start playing and I cant put my Kindle fire down haha
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Great - as expected - play it almost every day.  Looking forward to his next album!!! Thanks for your swift delivery
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I really can't comment on the game as it would not load.  I tried several times, starting from square A each time, and it just simply wouldn't finish the loading process.  Very disappointing, but I guess that's what I get for accepting a &#34;freebee&#34;.  I recommend that you just don't bother with it.
B0000AC8LR|5.0|The first time I watched this, I knew I loved it.  However I didn't really understand the plot fully.  And unless you are extremely smart and known something about time travel, you will probably be in the same boat as me.  After some internet research (YouTube, Yahoo Answers)for the complete plot unveiled, I felt much better about the plot and the next day I watched it again.  It was amazing to see everything fall into place and I found my own meaning to the movie and its amazing ending.  If having to do a little research and taking observations from those smarter than you after watching a movie isn't your thing and if you don't enjoy feeling a little confused, then this movie probably isn't for you.  But if you are like me, then you will probably enjoy this film immensely.
B002SRQ214|5.0|No complaints here works better then my old 2 core and performs better for gaming, installed nice, arrived in good time, thus I am satisfied with the product/seller
B00005JLWN|5.0|If you liked UltraViolet, you'll love this movie.  The gun fighting styles of UltraVioled were first developed for this movie, and then later perfected for UV.  I happen to like this movie better than UV, but that's just my taste.
B004499KJU|5.0|My girlfriend uses this as her key ring and she loves it. It's cute, fashionable, and goes well with the Minou (also by Alessi).
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game was really fun until the update, then on my kindle fire it froze and I had to deleted the app. I'm in the process of downloading it again,I hope it did not lose my high score and . Power ups.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I am a long-time fan but this is his best album since The Rising.  I played it for a friend tonight who is rushing out to purchase it.
B002FQOI0A|4.0|Pretty confusing story but I understood at.the.end. the ending was really really great and well organized which makes a good story
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We really enjoy this and makes for great family and friends time.  Also love the versatility of the game that changes the board each time and gives everyone an even chance no matter how good or novice you are.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|The first five minutes I thought &#34;oh no, this is a wipe&#34; BUT then the action really started. This turned out to be a very fun movie to watch and I'm hoping for a sequel.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Great book for a laugh! I'd recommend it for a quick fun read.  Sophie kinsella has done it once again!
B00DGN51O8|5.0|I really didn't think I would enjoy this movie, but it was captivating! Well written script, well acted parts. Definitely something I'd watch again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|OMG! My favourite App ever!  The only App I've ever had that makes me laugh EVERY time I play it! WOOHOO!  Apppttt! Banana. Hehehe.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|It's in my car stereo, it's on my computer. I can't stop listening. Someone help .... buy this one, it's great!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|wonderful game lots of fun very addictive with hours and hours of fun and lots of costumes and achievements and goals to accomplish
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|So far, it works. Hard to see the small print for the Android USB port and the iOS USB port. Too early to tell on durability, however, it works.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|My husband has Dementia and this book has helped me alot understanding the different stages of dementia and Alzheimers.  It is truly a sad disease since there is so little you can help with. This book helps you get a idea of what they may be feeling .  my husband doesn't think he is sick. .
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again Hosseini writes a beautiful masterpiece filled with emotion and love. I enjoyed this novel as much if not more than his previous two, Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Sometime in July, the ap was totally re-done. Hate the new layout. Seems there's all kinds of stuff, including more and intrusive ads, but not more weather related content.  Please give us the old ap back!!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Very helpful to keep my calendar and life up to date.  The reminders are great, too, if I choose to use them.  Also, very handy.  Thank you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me in suspense the whole time. Can't wait to read the third book. You are a  great storyteller Suzanne Collins.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This Is one of my top ten movies. Love the plot and the action. I had to have the real thing not a copy.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Love all the Quell games. Well thought out. Even ths easy levels are challenging to do in the minimum numbers of moves.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have to admit that I watched the show prior to reading the book. I loved the book no less for it though! I real life that the show followed the book perfectly...better than any movie or show based on a book that I have seen. The book rewarded me for reading though with some extra bits of information. I look forward to reading the next one!!
0525478817|5.0|This book is already amazing and I'm only on chapter 11 ! It is a good romance and sad story but makes you laugh ! I absolutely love this book (: it's a mist get book !
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This is my first &quot;find the hidden object&quot; game.  Nice change of pace from  flipping birds or driving. Probably would be a little easier to play on a tablet instead of a  smartphone
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|great movie,tom cruise played well in this movie and also great story with good picture like the actress as well.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|I freaking love Gemma Arterton so whatever she's in is a winner in my book. lol It was fun to watch...
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|So Glad B Sanderson was chosen to wrp up the series after Jordan died.  He did a great job and the conclusion was awesome!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is great for kids it also its a game that makes time fly by. There are some bugs but overall its a great game.
B002LVVCQM|1.0|While I love Richard Dawkins, and I know this book would be well worth the money, this kindle book is useless to me unless my kindle and read it to me. Why are most of his books with Text-to-Speech all disabled? I have purchased every one of his books that I can find that are enabled, but not this one. Sorry Richard. Maybe one day. Its on my Amazon wish list, and I keep coming back to look, and when it becomes enabled I guarantee I will buy it.
1476734941|5.0|Doing the 500 calorie 24 hour 2:00 pm to 2:00 pm schedule.<br />It is a diet I can stick to.<br />This diet WORKS!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An excellent book, with unexpected twists and turns. This book will have you on the edge of your seat until the end. Will Katniss cave in and lead a happy life with Peeta, or is she destined to be with Gale? Just how far did the Capital go with Peeta, and is it so bad that Katniss and him will never be the same again? President Snow is finished torturing innocent children, or is he? Find the answers to these questions and more in the final book of: The Hunger Games<br />:D The best book you could possibly read.<br />Is Prim a survivor,or are the bombs takin out her as well? That remains for YOU to find out.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A book referred by a number of friends.  I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was in the story.  Great book
B005DOKM9M|3.0|It's a very tight fit with no room to also hold a stylus.  Other than that it seems well made and does the job.
B003VANOFY|3.0|A good solution if you need wireless sound for your PC.<br /><br />Good:  Nice usb interface for PC.  Works fine with Win7 64bit.  Comfortable to wear.  Charge lasts about 10 hours, and you can listen to them while charging with a standard mini usb cable.  Good sound at low to moderate volume.  Does a decent job of processing surround sound audio signals.  Programmable buttons are handy if you sit away from your PC and need to pause or advance tracks.<br /><br />Bad:  Wireless cuts out from time to time, seems to be troubled by interference with other appliances.  This is NOT the latest in digital channel-switching wireless.  Totally lacking in deep bass:  if you listen to bass heavy music or like the deep rumble in movies and games this product doesn't deliver.<br /><br />These aren't &#34;real&#34; surround sound headphones, it's &#34;simulated surround sound.&#34;  However, since wireless headphones that feature &#34;real&#34; surround sound, with multiple speakers in each earphone, cost several hundred dollars, these do a decent job at their price point.<br /><br />They get the job done for a reasonable price.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it and show it off in my job!  Works great on my Kindle!  I take pictures with it and  I'll be trying the  recording feature soon.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|My daughter enjoys this game.  I like it because she really has to think about how to decorate the balls.  It takes some thought to know what colors and covers to use to decorate the balls correctly.  They are challenging and she keeps at it until she has it right.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|You should expect this to be fairly simple with a lot of action to make up for complexity of plot.  If you are ok with that, it's a great movie to watch with some fried chicken and a 2-liter of cola.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|The Die Hard franchise has apparently chosen to parody itself with this film.  One can see the attempts at humor but they all fall flat.  The action scenes are fast and some are mildly inventive, but the finale is pretty standard stuff.  I recommend re-watching the first Die Hard to remember how well it all started.  Wait for this dud to be free through Amazon Prime or Netflix.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was very interesting &amp; easy enough so that it offered a challenge without be frustrating. The scenes were beautiful &amp; the music relaxing without being annoying where you have to turn it off. It was long enough too.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Awesome movie. So many one liners and hidden jokes. Just as good as Shaun of the Dead or better. Instant classic.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I was hesitant to read this book because I thought it was going to be a  sappy love story that would have me crying by the end of the story. I was wrong. Of course it was romantic, but it was also suspenseful, and I love suspense. I love a book or movie that has you saying, \\"Huh, I didn't see that coming.\\"  I only hope the movie is just as good!  I would recommend anyone who likes romance and suspense to read this book!
B007CT1UJ2|5.0|This is the best travel book I've ever read. Funny, informative, classic Bryson. He has a genuine love for his subject and covers all of the idiosyncrasies of Australia and Australians in affectionate and often hilarious detail. Engaging writer, charmingly self-deprecating. Not sure which I like better--the audio version (read by Bryson himself), where you can appreciate his impeccable comic timing (his sendup of the cricket matches he listens to while driving  some remote backcountry road is worth the price of admission alone), or the book version, where you can truly appreciate the quality of his prose. Read this one and then get his other books.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I downloaded this when it was TFAOD. I figured it wouldn't be the entire game but was wrong. This is challenging enough to keep me interested but not impossible to play. It has replay value as well. I cleared and started again and the puzzles were slightly different. I am however stuck on BACK IN THE LIBRARY.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing! I think everyone should play this game its has a amazing endless run with obstacles and goals to do!
B000W93CHC|4.0|Not great.  The similarity to the first theme makes for a &#34;I've been here before&#34; kind of feel but enough of a new story and a lead off from the last to keep me entertained.
0061950726|5.0|This was great. It is amazing to read what people had to do just to survive and not be bitter what live handed them.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game of adult hide and seek.  It keeps you interested by challenging you with different ways you have to find the items, shadows and in the dark with a flashlight, but also it helpful while learning the objects in regular mode. I would recommend this to anyone who like word searches and hide and seek.
1608871819|5.0|Amazing!  It definitely made my collection of Man of Steel related movie memoralbilia complete.  I was thoroughly pleased with the production quality of the book, the price, and the delivery time..
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It was da good game of da best so of all time, I woke up in a new bugatti and I finna play da game in ghetto shootout.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I've enjoyed this movie so much & I've watched several times & in the future, it will be there for me to watch again. To me, when I get a movie that I like, it's like a friend, something to enjoy over & over.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|My water-resistent Withings Pulse went through a wash and dry cycle with NO DAMAGE!  I was really impressed!  My Fitbit One, in the same pocket, was toast!<br /><br />Things I like about the Withings Pulse -- the heartrate meter seems to be accurate.  I usually get a reading about 90% of the time; 10% of the time I have to retake my pulse (an error message appears).  Rechargeable battery life seems to last a week or more before needing USB charging.  The Withings Pulse is the newest unit; probably the most advanced of Withings and Fitbit products.  The touch screen seems to work well, although once I guess in my pocket I accidentally switched it to sleep monitoring mode, and the next day it told me I had slept 20 hours!<br /><br />Things I don't like about the Withings Pulse -- the Pulse is an Iphone/IPad-centric device; it can't connect to a PC.  I don't generally use my Ipad, so when I want it to synchronize I have to get my Ipad out and have it download the data from the Withings Pulse.  That only takes about 30 seconds, but I prefer to have something that connects to my PC.<br /><br />I have also used the Fitbit Zip (an older, button battery-powered unit), and the Fitbit One.<br /><br />Things I like about the Fitbit units -- they both connect via a dongle to my PC!  If I get within a couple feet of my PC, they automatically download the data to my PC!  The Fitbit One is newer, and also monitors sleep, which I don't need or use.  The Fitbit One has a rechargeable battery which lasts only a couple days.<br /><br />My favorite of the three is actually the older Fitbit Zip!!!  It is about half the cost of the Withings Pulse or Fitbit One.  The button battery it uses lasts more than a month.  I purchase the CR2025 batteries in bulk through the Internet and they only cost about 30 cents each in bulk (DON'T purchase at Radio Shack -- that will set you back about $7 per battery!!!).  The Fitbit Zip is actually the smallest of the three units.  It is NOT water resistantlike the Withings Pulse, however, and did not survive the wash cycle that the Withings Pulse did!<br /><br />I did check the pedometer function of the Fitbit Zip vs. the Withings Pulse -- the readings were comparable (380 steps vs. 397 steps).  Without actually counting steps I cannot state which unit was more accurate, but the readings were close.  Obviously if you are very concerned about accuracy you might want to calibrate your steps by actually counting them and seeing what your unit reads, then measure your average step to correct for what the unit thinks the distance you are traveling is.<br /><br />To recap, the Withings Pulse is probably the most technologically advanced -- and survived a wash and dry cycle!!! -- while the much less expensive Fitbit Zip is my preference because of its PC connectivity and smaller size!  Withings makes very high quality equipment -- I also have their blood pressure meter (which also only connects to an IPad or Iphone) and their body fat scale.  You won't go wrong with a Withings product, but do be aware that you'll need an IPad or Iphone to use! ---
B000SC245E|5.0|I have no real comments on this unit it is doing the job it is suppose to do and that's all I expected.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have truly enjoyed the Sookie Stackhouse books.  I'm not sure this is the end that I hoped for Sookie, but it was still a good story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great! Easy to use and has an attractive clean interface! I would definitely recommend this to others. Worth the download.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|This is simply a comment on the single disc Blu-Ray edition, that is sold for almost the same price as the standard DVD edition, which is still in print. The transfer to Blu-Ray is excellent, and clearly better than the very-good-for-DVD transfer on the DVD. However, the Blu-Ray edition does not contain any commentary or any extras except the trailer. I have watched the movie on DVD with the director's commentary, and it really added a lot to my enjoyment of this intricately plotted movie, including the commentary about Kevin Spacey's incredible handling of so many of the great scenes. I would still buy this, but if you are at all a film buff, I would also buy the DVD for the commentary, as well as several other extras. It will really add to your enjoyment of this noir classic, at a not unreasonable cost.<br /><br />PS: For some reason, Amazon is putting this as a review of the Instant Video version, even though I posted on the Blu-Rat page. While I got the instant video version for \\"free\\" with the Blu_Ray purchae,  I am reviewing the Blu-Ray edition. I have not watched the Amazon Video version and have no comment on its quality, etc.

B00E3VTR1K|5.0|This read was a bit of a new experience for me, and I found it enjoyable. Galactic Energies, by Luca Rossi, is a captivating multi-genre anthology of short stories. There's a recurring futuristic technological element that I think that sci-fi fans will enjoy.<br /><br />I always like to research an author a little while I'm reading their work to get an idea of where they're coming from. Luca Rossi's author bio is a bit...elusive, so-to-speak. I did a bit of web searching and realized that his resume goes way beyond what you might expect from a sci-fi author. Without giving too much away (hey, do your own homework!), I can see where his life experience contributed to his stories. That being said, Google him when you're about half-way or so into this book and you'll gain some insight into this author and his stories.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this app! It entertains me and keeps me focused. I really enjoy looking for pairs while trying to beat my last time record.

B00DHSK3RM|3.0|Well it's seems to be to fast to work on a small sell phone, it's like the timer is not long enough for the application
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fast paced, It will keep your mind busy. A great game for the whole family. My granddaughter loves to play.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I love the prose in this book. It carried me through. Perfectly executed story. And 5 stars for a lovely book cover. 4 stars because I felt the book shift halfway through. For some reason, I wish I could explain, I didn't feel the intimacy with the characters anymore. Strange because that's when the two main characters became close and began loafing about with one another a lot. Can't put my finger on it, but the book is well worth the time.
B0002DXEPI|4.0|julie andrews is as usual entertaining with her great singing voice and clipped british accent.  the movie stereotypes the chinese but since this is in good fun all is forgiven
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|The game is graphically interesting. The audible was annoying so I turned it off. The game itself is frustrating for a non logically functioning brain. It is really hard for me to be that logical and have to remember the sequence of things so it is for strictly personal reasons that I gave &#34;factory balls&#34; only three stars.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|The story is plausible, without fiction, which kept me interested the most! I'm eagerly waiting for the next book to be released.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game.  It puts temple run to shame. Lots of variety. I love how you can constantly upgrade without spending real money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played. I think everyone should play it. it is really fun .
030758836X|5.0|For the most part, the reviews of Gillian Flynn's novel refer to the perplexing relationship of a married couple. Instead of focusing on the relationships, I want to mention the writing structure of \\"Gone Girl.\\" As the story unfolds, it breaks two usual rules of fiction writing mean to satisfy readers.<br />Rule 1.  Readers need to empathize with the protagonist. Flynn does not give the readers a dog in this fight. Who the protagonist depends on where the reader is in the story.<br />Rule 2. The story has a satisfying outcome. Flynn dodged writing a clich&eacute; conclusion. Saying more gives away the ending.<br />The readers' reaction to this novel, from my point of view, depends on their subjective view of marriage. (Although I did not consider murder, many times I wished my mate had also vanished as did the wife in the story.) And, whether the reader needs a novel to follow the traditional storyline to consider it good.<br />I found Flynn's tale delicious and believe her book should be required reading for Fiction Writing courses as an example of creative plotting
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a thinking game that works the brain. A great way to challenge yourself and others if you want to make a game of it!
B0036OS3JW|5.0|I love these boots.  They are so comfortable and fit so very nice.  And they keep my feet warm.  I am so glad I ordered these.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|What is not to love about this game? Puzzle solving, logical thinking. Changing puzzles with a flair that leads to thinking.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The new updates have made a great game even better. It's now my personal reward for accomplishing my day's goals. Once you get a handle on what you're doing, this game is very addictive...
B0042TV4IW|3.0|This is an enjoyable British show. It is nothing spectacular, but fun to watch. The acting in it is very good.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I really loved it.  Great characters and storylines.  So much more than the typical &#34;unpopular kid finds his groove&#34; movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game really is a lot of fun, and horribly addicting!!! If you love bingo this app will make you love it even more. If you get it, connect with Facebook -- there are more perks and it always saves your gameplay.<br /><br />I also love how this is online, so you play with hundreds of other people!<br /><br />I recommend this game, 100%.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|I like batman and I like the series but be ready for different animation than your used to but still enjoy
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I am Evan I am 9 years old. This is a awesome game. It is the best game in the world!!!!!
B004IPPINW|5.0|Great read! One of the best books I've read in years. The monologue style grabs you immediately putting you inside the head of a privileged Pakistani who evolves from his somewhat materialistic high paced New York career into a more caring, though more synical Fundamentalist.<br />I could almost sympathize with him as he 'began to see' the world from an opposite viewpoint. What makes this story so believable is it didn't need the horrible devastation in his country nor the deaths of his family to turn him against America. Instead, he saw how his own selfish behavior was destroying everything he had valued.<br />A real eye opener!
B00DULWFZE|4.0|I bought this album because I have to own it. However, the album isn't great, maybe I'm bias because Brian didn't have as many lead vocals as usual. I was disappointed with that. If they had to narrow the songs from 50 down to 14 I wish they made better selections. If anything the bonus songs are better than any of the songs on the album. I recommend to buy it to show your support, not an album I would have on repeat. None the less I'm still excited and I can't wait till the next album.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. It really tests your skills and keeps you on your toes playing this game! Fun
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Good movie, Action was good, the plot was ok to keep you waiting for what happens next. This movie was very good. The actors melded together, played off each other enjoyable.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played! I hope you add this game to the Kindle very soon
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love It 's is good and to play on the kindle. Despicable me is fun to play on the kindle .the Despicable me : Minion Rush.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|I plan to use the lessons and techniques in this book every day and in every relationship. I have learned even the most subtle word choices have great impact. I now know identifying my own needs is integral to authentic communications, and others' actions are not the cause of my anger or unhappiness. Read this book and help change the world one person at a time.
B007THA4FI|1.0|J.K. Rowlings threw everything but the kitchen sink into this book.  I guess she was trying to be current, so she included cutting, drug abuse, verbal abuse, poverty, etc.  As a result, the plot was barely there.
B008CIUS72|1.0|It doesn't do what it purports to do.  It is a waste of your time and a waste of your money.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great concept, a lot of fun to read, but loses steam.  Good beach book and very clever.  Wish she had sustained it throughout.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am always looking for a book to read on my long flights. These 2 books made me not want to get up from my seat and work. Can hardly wait until 2014 for the last book in trilogy.
0425263908|4.0|Reading this book reminds me of fifty shades of grey. Lots of similarities. I thought it was an ok book. I would of gave it five stars because I thought it need more suspense. It seemed to lack something...but would recommend this book who love steam romance! ;)
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Great book, easy read. Emotional and true. A different kind of love story that keeps you wondering where the silver lining comes to play.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I think that this movie explain very well the world of gaming. There's a lot of hidden &#34;easter eggs&#34; everywhere throughout the movie and the story is well built. Also, we see a lot of characters that already exist in other real game such as Street Fighter and Sonic the Hedgehog.<br />I recommend it to those who know at least a little on the video game subject or there are some parts that they won't really understand. This movie is mainly for gamers, but non-gamers could grow to like it for having a lovely character, beautiful design and a good story.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Wow! Truly struck home with the fictional zombie war. It really surrounds you as you got deeper and deeper into the book, as hough you lived through it all. Not only a good fictional book but also a warning to us. What would happen if something, anything, just as devastating as supposed &#34;zombie virus&#34; hit us? What would we all do then? It raises so many questions that people neglects, about ourselves and our society. Overall, it truly is a great read, the movie is nothing comparing to this. Wish i had discovered this book sooner than the movie producers, because it really is different compare to the movie.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This is a beautiful movie! The animation is stunning and the textures are so well detailed. Each character is lovely and brings us back to our childhood. This movie made me start to believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy again.<br />I recommend this movie for everyone that still have an inner child in them, you will surely fall in love with this wonderful piece of animation.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game very  fun to play.also what y'all need to do is add same more characters and make it more challenging.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just enjoy the characters, the intrigue, and the aristocracy!!!  cant wait for season 4!!!  I am intrigued with all the characters,
1938469011|1.0|If you're into Stan Hieronymus' style of journalistic, interview based writing, than this book may not be as disappointing to you. I also picked this book up as I finished \\"Yeast\\" in the same series, with hopes of gaining the same type of practical information on hops as I did on yeast. Just as he did in \\"Brew Like a Monk,\\" the author interviews tons of people and tries to express his point with short quotes or stories from the interviewee. It has tons of informational history on hops. But it seriously lacks any practical, hands on information on actual brewing (especially the home brewer).<br /><br />Take the chapter \\"Dry Hopping\\" as an example. In this chapter, the author talks about tons of machines that various breweries use to dry hop their beers. Being a lowly home brewer, I was hoping for a simple one or two pages about dry hopping in a carboy, maybe with different tips, tricks, or techniques.<br /><br />You could also make the same argument for the chapter called \\"Growing Hops.\\" Tons of interviews of hop growers telling anecdotal stories. Information for a home cultivator (which I am) in this chapter is non existent. I got more information from the Hop Farm I bought the rhizomes at.<br /><br />Bottom Line: This is not a Practical Guide for anything. If you love everything hops, this is probably a good read for you. If you are expecting tons of cool stuff to help you brew better beer, take a pass.

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|There are lots of in app purchases it wants you to make, but you can do without them and it is still fun. P.S. This is the 1,001th review.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Quick to download and easy to connect to my cloud player.  I now have access to all of my mp3 purchases on my android device.  Love it!
B00DURILJ2|3.0|Cute movie love matthew of course, it was worth the watch if you like strange stories. kinda sad at times.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I love this film! The box is great, the extras are interesting. If you like the movie enough to own it and watch it more then once then this blu-ray/dvd combo is the way to go.
0345529057|5.0|I love it so very very much it hurts me so bad, as in just pure wonderful. What great great show that I dig.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|I really loved this book.. The first one of kate Morton's that I have read.  It is a beautiful story.

B009DCOU9S|4.0|I enjoyed this game very much. It was easy enough to keep frustration<br /> From ruining a good time. But challenging enough to occupy a rainy afternoon. Loved it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Rereading Ender' Game was like sliding on an old pair of jeans. The comfort and the memories felt just right! I had forgotten so much of the story, that I could not believe what I was reading. Was I too young and inexperienced the first go, around? Maybe, but am I still that 20 year old, who has learned more, and can play with Ender, now. Not to say, that I have the knowledge of Ender, but I have experienced more of myself and the world around me. If you have not given yourself the chance, read Ender's Game, for the first time or like me, read it again, you will not be disapointed.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It is a cute movie.  I had no expectations or very little so i was happily impressed.  Allowed you to laugh and had a serious message as well!
B004A8ZWWO|1.0|WOW, an hour into this movie and not even one laugh, seriously. Why on earth would anyone watch a Ben Stiller Eddie Murphy movie if not for laughs? An hour into this movie and nothing at all happens.I couldn't take it anymore. And when will Eddie Murphy be allowed to play a non- stereotypical black? When he tries talking like he's from the hood it sounds really forced, old, and played out, its the same voice he's been doing for like 30 years, enough already.Its not even kind of funny, just insulting. And how is it even possible for Ben Stiller not to be funny? This movie is a total disaster.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun Little Game- I would never pay money for this, but for free its a good game to pass the time on long car rides.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I have barely opened the box, and I already hate it.  It requires a power adaptor or USB from the TV to power it.  The clunky power adaptor is conspicuously left out of the product photos.  LAME!<br /><br />Update:  I plugged it into my tv, and got it set up just fine.  Picture was ok, just like most streaming video, just ok.  However, since my tv is mounted on the wall, I will not be keeping the chromecast, since it requires and extension cord up the fireplace to the power it.  Off to e-bay with it.  Glad I only wasted $35.
B00499QUK2|5.0|A VERY addicting show! It is pretty amazing. If you are looking for a great new show to watch, look no further! :)
1250012570|4.0|The book is very well written and flows seemlessly. I enjoyed the story and, when it was done, I wanted more. I found it very easy to imagine and care about the characters and the author captured the school age experience remarkably well, making it extremely easy to relate to Eleanor and Park, especially if you are from a similar generation. Doesn't end exactly how I expected (which was nice, actually) but the ending was appropriate all the same.
B000TETD9Q|5.0|One of the best bands thus fantastic music. Brings back lots of good memories!! Highly recommend this to anyone who loves the Beach Boys.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|An amazing book for such a low price!You get absorbed into the world and you can't stop reading until the end. Can't wait for the next book!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just as I've suspected Pooh.  The key to getting out, is in the key.  Don't worry, listen to the others.  Medium easy to medium hard.  Elementary, my dear Whoopie!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This game let me know just how much my neural maps have degenerated with age.<br />It has a clean simple appearance and the options are pretty much what one would expect.<br />The difficulty level is presented as a sliding scale which you adjust to please yourself (Ha!).<br />I set it in the middle and soon found that, if I wanted to beat the putative &#34;average&#34;, I'd better concentrate more and take more time over my moves (or continue to be guilty of taking back the moves I stuffed up!). This then exaggerated the difference between my plodding efforts and the lightning speed of my opponent. (e.g. 10 minutes vs 10 seconds ).<br />And I was struck by the realisation that intelligence is not just problem-solving ability but speed of same.<br />So, I'm now well-and-truly aware of my status in the chess world, but I have something that will help me to sharpen my mind if I let it, and it didn't cost me a bean. A very good download methinks.
B000V6U7VK|5.0|This album has such great music on it. I listen to it while studying or just resting with a book.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Awesome movie great writing and story. Great effects and a nice way to merge magneto origin and xmen to bring a top notch movie with great action and emotion.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use Bible app. There are a lot of choices on the Bible versions that can be downloaded and used off line. Some versions even have audio so that you can listen to them. I highly recommend this app.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very good book, engaging and uplifting story of love and loss. Beautiful treatment of several families fight against childhood cancer
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Even though it is a movie, it does take one back in time to the age of Ancient Rome and the Coliseum.  Russell Crow is superb in the movie

B001WCN23W|5.0|Just a couple of years ago I didn't like The Rolling Stones at all, period. Then I heard Jumping Jack Flash and Paint it, Black. I thought those were pretty awesome songs, so I looked up more of their music. I found out a lot of the tunes I kept coming back to, were all on Sticky Fingers so I got the album as Christmas present. And it changed my viewpoint completely!<br /><br />Brown Sugar /8.0/10 - A nice catching riff and tune, perfect to start an album with. I never get that much into this song, especially when the album's deeper cuts are the true gems!<br /><br />Sway /9.5/10 - This song set me on the path! Mick J./Mick T./Keith R. wrote an awesome tune lyrically and musically. It's a rocker with strangely deep lyrics and has often been seen as Mick Taylor's best guitar solos. I haven't listen to much to John Mayall and the blues breakers (Mick T.'s old band) but it's a pretty good guitar solo to me.<br /><br />Wild Horses /9.0/10 - A soft, mostly acoustic upbeat tune, that is famous as 'Brown Sugar'. Example of The Stones' romantic, soft side.<br /><br />Can't you hear me knocking? /10/10 - The juggernaut of the album! Starting of with Keith's electric guitar and Jagger's pleading voice in the song's lyrics. Then suddenly it's a jazz/blues type tune. With the best saxophone solo I've ever heard! And then Mick Taylor comes in to seal the deal with a jazz type guitar solo. A true clean battle of guitarists in this tune.<br /><br />You Gotta Move /9.0/10 - One of my personal favorite Stones' tracks. Short and sweet like 'Factory Girl' in Beggar's Banquet. Features why The Stones' were one best white groups to ever play blues music. Dirty riff, dirty vocals, clean simple lyrics, but such a heavy tune.<br /><br />Bitch /8.5/10 - To be honest I never listened to this one that much. But, it's a great song. Catchy and some nice saxophone and Charlie and Bill keep rhythm up just like in all the other songs.<br /><br />I got the Blues - 8.5/10 - Another great song. Lovethe organ used in this, it just screams out the title.<br /><br />Sister Morphine - 9.0/10 - Another personal favorites. A deadly song that starts out just acoustic and then get's heavier along the way. The song is the very bottom of drugs, mostly illicit drugs, craving more shot of whatever, because you know your going to be dead soon, even calling cousin cocaine to come numb your pain. The piano in this is one of the most hardcore sounds ever in music I've heard. Perfect symbolization that experience shooters like Richards go when they O.D.<br /><br />Dead Flowers - 9.0/10 - A pretty popular tune for me never hearing it on radio or any media. Mick goes country in this, at first I didn't like his voice but I soon loved this song. It shows a more light, more optimism than the heaviness from Sister Morphine. Awesome lyrics and guitars by Keith, Mick, Bill and Charlie's jamming along to with the percussion.<br /><br />Moonlight Mile - 10/10 - A beautiful ballad. Mick's voice sounds so great in this. And it's like an Orchestra played this song's background. All instruments in this are beautiful, in the end there is an instrumental music piece that's like 2 minutes. While listening to it, it's hard to believe it's The Rolling Stones', you know the bad boys of rock n roll, the most dangerous band, making such tender, delicate music as this. Even though the very opposite of this being the first song, is a perfect example.<br /><br />Before this album, I hated Jagger's voice and now I see the uniqueness of it. Keith Richards' was an \\"Ok\\" guitarist now I see why he is so praised now. This album opened me to The Rolling Stones(Anything between 1962-Mick Taylor's departure), this and \\"Beggar's Banquet\\". This album should appeal to everyone even if you don't like Jagger's voice or whatever, it's such a creative piece of music. And Mick Taylor just completed it so perfect as him being lead and Keith being rhythm, such an amazing effort. Coming from a guy who \\"used\\" to think theStones' were an overrated, doped up all the time band.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Jason Mraz is a great music writer and singer. His music makes you think and value the simple things of life.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Best book ever! I seen the movie and let me say that the book is the best! Love it! :)
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I love the songs. You can hear the music over and over without getting tired. Great music lyrics, rhythm and singer.
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|it is oK if you like a few classics that you can download and use to read to yourself. but there is really not too much diversity out there.
0316247545|5.0|It has tons of pictures, always a plus in my (pony) book. There is some interesting quotes from people that work on the show, and even a piece by Lauren Faust I was happy to see. It also summarizes every episode, and has the lyrics to every (EVERY) song from the show. I love the art work on the hard cover, front and back.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie was surprisingly entertaining. I loved the main character zombie. Excellent movie for the end of the week. Funny and sweet.
0894803123|5.0|I read the whole introduction which was really fun. The book explains why they use the ingredients that they do with recommendations for making your own. I have made the raspberry ice cream  and added chocolate chips to it. It is fabulous!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I always the play and was skeptical about the movie because in the past, it sucked. This movie is the best. It's amazing that the actors actually sang while filming, no dubbing.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Play store is on version 5.0 and here we have version 1.2 from almost 2 years ago. I won't be buying anymore EA games.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|As usual, this series is fabulous. If you are a fan of Dexter, you'll love it. The last episode will shock you.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The graphics are good with a good storyline. I haven't played a game like this since resident evil. I like it a lot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun this game will definitely keep you on your toes when the speed picks up it gets challenging quick<br />Stcloudgrl
B007KDFWRG|2.0|Again I must pay more attention when I'm listening to the preview samples.<br /><br />I've only listened once to each of the two discs (and I may not bother again) but, so far, only two out of all the tracks have any originality at all. All the rest sound like any run of the mill Saturday night blare and bashit pub band.<br /><br />And the covers of other band's hits are very poor.<br /><br />I would have given it one star but I don't like the word &#34;hate&#34; associated with my comments so I gave it two.<br /><br />Sam
0345529057|3.0|I found the print exceptionally small even for glasses, very difficult to read.  I love the book but not in this format.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|As usual, Blake Shelton does it again with some really great songs!  I love listening to them and it was worth every penny!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Some people are put on this planet to pivot the rest of us.  Steve Jobs is a wonder, and reading about his life and accomplishments leaves one marveling at how one person can have so much impact n so many people.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am very pleased with the Solitaire that was placed on my Kindle.  I have not had enough spare time to enjoy it yet, but I have been very pleased with the times I have played.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly has worked very nicely as my new way to read the blogs that I love. My list of blogs transferred seamlessly from Google with no hassle to me.  I enjoy the way feedly allowed me to sort how I view everything and it is very easy to use on a tablet.
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|I saw this movie in the theater. It is action packed, but the story line didn't provide much in the way of grabbing my interest. I actually fell asleep for a few minutes! It's not bad, but I don't recommend that you waste your money buying the DVD unless it's like $5.  This is a \\"bargain bin\\" movie (dvd).
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An outstanding novel with a wonderful twist at the end. I would highly recommend this book. A reminder of whatthe human Body is capable of.
0451228731|5.0|look out Tom Clancy, Daniel Suarez is coming.  With recent expose's of NSA and Snowden, it makes it more real
030758836X|2.0|Derivative. It's a word used frequently in Gone Girl. The main characters are always concerned that their brilliant wit isn't quite so brilliant and may be derivative. I hate to break it to the author, but some of this story and the entire character of Amy is derivative. Amy is a product of two psychologists who write books based on her, the child. Sounds familiar. Six Feet Under did that years ago with the story of Brenda. Halfway through the book I groaned because I realized I was reading what had been a popular 1990's movie (and book prior to that) only this one tweaked it a bit. The ending is so ridiculous and such a letdown that I found it hard not to throw it out the window.<br /><br /> The author clearly has deep issues with both men and women. Both are written in the most vile ways. No one is likable or remotely relatable. The book is loaded with plot devices that are so in your face that it no longer has any sense of reality. People make horrible decisions just so the author can get from point A to B. I just kept thinking that no one could be that stupid (since they had been presented as brilliant) until I realized it was the only way the author figured a character in or out of a situation.  I'm positive there were smarter ways.<br /><br />This was a big mess of a story. The only positive was that it did have some interesting social commentary regarding the media (Nancy Grace) and the electronic times we live in. The actual plot was laughable and unrealistic.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|Current version has extreme issue with screen changes. Screens are sticking and sections of buttons do not work at times. I have to kill the application each time. Please add a game/app reset button.
B00D6SBOWG|2.0|realy  this is nonsence I cant get it to turn on and I'm I want to say this game id grrrrr
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|My granddaughter loved it as much as I did when I first saw it!  She is eight and already singing some of the songs!  Thank you for providing such a great service so that &#34;older movies&#34; become new all over again!
0385523394|1.0|Other readers have hit it on the head with this book... It is shallow, self-serving, and outright annoying to read. The author had an excellent opportunity to show some of the beautiful humanity that exists in a place where you wouldn't expect it, but instead she just comes off as a snob who can't believe how popular she is in prison.<br /><br />I wish I could give this book zero stars...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I wish I was better at it, though. Hopefully they keep adding new areas to play in.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What a phenomenal game! Better than subway surfers AND temple run 1 &amp; 2 (my opinion) .. Not only are they cute, but kid friendly too. My nephew is 2 and just loves to help me collect the BANANAS! And what makes it even better is that it gets challenging throughout the game ... especially with the little battles. Must get app for entertainment and well.... JUST BECAUSE ! Lol *kisses*
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I have designed a new world economic system.  Jame's book is the best resource I have found to help me kick start this $311 trillion dollar 100% SUSTAINABLE economic system.  I love his realistic down to earth perspective.... and good choice of case histories.<br />I am following his clear cut plan for publishing my books, and raising capital.  I have purchased 3 of his books so far.  After 45 years in real estate, architecture, construction, and reading thousands of books and tens of thousands of articles.... I can honestly tell you, James is right on the mark on almost everything.  If you are going to change the world, or just change one person, yourself; this book is really worth the read.  Most Sincerely,  Arthur F. Renner
B009DCOU9S|4.0|A find the object game. It has its moments when it is challenging, but much of it is dialogue and reading. It is fairly lengthy so a good free app of the day. Still, I  wish there was more finding and A LOT less dialogue.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|The game is fun its self but everytime u click on smthing it says game not accesible try . Again later and thats lame!!!
0060254920|5.0|Any human being who has ever let their imagination take them to far away places will enjoy this book. There are very few works that capture what it's like to feel as a child feels; this work is one of them, and it does a masterful job of it.
0544002318|4.0|I like the way he tells the story and mix food recipes and training advised. i recommend it to anyone who likes running
0395389496|5.0|A marvelous writing style coupled with beautiful pictures equals a tremendous triumph of literature. There is no individual, regardless of age, that can not enjoy this work.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Helps me get to sleep AND love the timer and close app functions, so glad I decided to upgrade also, worth it!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best game ever. The new farmville. Must tell everyone.I just cant stop playing. I even have my kids<br />playing. Need more stars though.....
B0061S0A64|5.0|This app looked boring at first, but it is rather fun. Lots of different way change the sounds, and easy to use. My 1 year old son loves playing with it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As always, Tom Clancy knows how to make it very hard to put this book down. It's not only the characters that we have come to love, but the plot is intriguing. I know it's fiction, but we should all be aware of the dangers of a cyber attact. Great Read!!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I'm sorry, but I'm in my 60's and I had to get this movie!  I have no children or grandchildren around but I just had to see this young, feisty lady in action and let me tell you, she is a hoot!  Reminds me of my wife (when she was much younger)!  This was a great movie...I'm sure my grandkids would love it too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is awesome. My wife and I love it. Can't wait for season four. We highly recommended it to all.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is my very favorite video game of all time. I have it on all my computers, an old Dell Axim, and now my Kindle.  My grandkids love it too.  It actually teaches me to focus my attention on details, which is getting harder for an old guy.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I like this Magic Academy game. The games are fun but the story line is great. I am on 12%
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|I love these true point-and-click adventure games! And,  no hidden object sections! Played this on 1st generation Kindle Fire with no glitches. Only had a problem with the rabbit's magic drawer - the sequence was different than that on the tree.,  but I figured it out by trial-and-error. Graphics were great,  and the mini-puzzles were excellent. The game is a good length,  and I just took my time and figure out the steps to take. Really loved this one!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Wow, a voice that gives me the opportunity to come out of the wilderness  If you want to again think that everything is possible, read this book and every other book by James Altucher.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This is a nice little timer for meditation.  The bells all sound very clear and authentic.  There are some additional features of showing where other people are in the world who are using the app at the same time as well, though they are rather tertiary to the primary use of the app.
0670022950|3.0|Pinker gives good explanations for the decline of violence, however he is too verbose.The book is 696 pages and the chapters can be too long: one is 138 pages. It's the kind of book you finally begin to scan looking for key points of which there are many good ones, amid too much information. For this reason, I've given it only 3 stars. But also, if one knows history, and has a non-judgmental awareness of today's violence, and understands how the parts of the brain functions, there is not that much of a surprise here. If on the other hand, you have not studied these things, there is much to learn.<br /><br />If you want to understand more about how the brain functions and how meditation can change the brain to bring you better mental health and well-being read &#34;How God Changes Your Brain&#34; by Andrew Newberg, MD (Neuroscientist) and Mark Robert Waldman, Therapist. Don't let the title put you off...it just reflects the experiments of brain scans they took when asking different groups of people what their thoughts about God were. Very Interesting book.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I've tried a couple of different remote access apps to get at my computer, and this is easily the best.  I have an Asus Transformer tablet which comes with one that you'd usually have to pay for, which worked on only a few connections I'd tried.  Generally, public WiFi networks are set up in such a way as to restrict data usage, not allowing services like Google Voice to work.  On such networks, other remote access apps usually don't work either.  Jump has connected reliably on any network that I've tried.  The controls are also fairly intuitive and quite easy to get used to using.<br /><br />For improvements, I'd love to see dedicated buttons added to the bottom bar of buttons for cut, copy, and paste.  This would speed things up greatly over having to open the keyboard, hit the app button for control, then the &#34;c&#34; key, etc.  Also, if you connect to the computer, leave the app, then have to reconnect when you go back in, it seems to change how large it things the computer screen is, leaving you with black, unresponsive bars around all sides when you reconnect.  This issue is solved when you exit out of the app entirely, then go back in.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This movie was okay but a bit disappointing.  The story line was slow and it jumped around a lot.  Acting was great but the story wasn't one of my favorites.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I first saw this production on PBS and I just had to have it for myself.  This is the third copy I have purchased because I keep giving them away.to people I love.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game has a good variety of things to do and keeps you thinking.  Also provides a strategy guide for if you get stuck so nothing is impossible.  Very addicting too!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I don't think there has been a singer who quite captures the feel of both the 40s and 50s, but makes that music relevant today as much as Michael does.  He makes me feel at home, I love his interpretation of the songs he does and his style.  Again, if you like Michael Buble at all, this is a must for all fans.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The movie was Awesome and the video was perfect on HD, I would highly recommend the prime service to everyone.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I admit to a great fondness for David Bowie and have a lot of his albums.  I loved Heroes, but as a general rule prefer his older music and that creates the majority of my Bowie library.  However, since I purchased this album, it has not been out of my car and I bring it in the house with me each time so I can listen to it here.  This has to be one of my all time favorites of his.  Yes, he is older and you can slightly tell it in his voice, but the songs are reminiscent of his older music and I love it!  If you like Bowie, this is a must.
1936608898|5.0|I loved that this book puts everything in a nutshell.  I have other paleo books that I like but this one is my favorite so far!  Thanks.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Not quite as good as the first two books in the series, but a quick and entertaining read nonetheless. Recommended -- but be sure to read the first two books in The Clifton Chronicles first.
B001MSMULG|3.0|It seem to drift in too many tangents which made it hard to concentrate at times.<br />Some of side stories seemed to be more filler.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game!!!!!  love playing. can be addictive but a very nice addiction nevertheless. it is easy to play for any age group
B00340LM8C|5.0|Grace Kelly's beauty, Cary Grant's moxy and humor, and Hitchcock's film genius create a classic film for all time. A library 'must have' if you are a film buff at any level!
B000VWYNOG|5.0|One of Van Morrison's greatest DVDs. I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to it and recommend it to all who love music. He is truly a talented, gifted, person.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am so enthralled in this story. The characters pull you in as if you were right there trying to change Christian way of thinking wall while lending Anastasia your wisdom after having her very first experience with sex and help her try to keep up with &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; himself.
0545101425|5.0|best price for new or used I got a new one cant wait for our next road trip this weekend to finish this series
B005USZYDU|4.0|It starts out slow but gets better keep reading the book. I would only recommend this book to government students or anyone interested in government. The book is a cliffhanger but it's still a great book keep reading it and you'll become hooked to the book.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|&#34;Mistborn: The Final Empire&#34; truly is a remarkable piece of writing. Many readers praise Sanderson for his original and inventive magic systems and his jaw-dropping, page-turning action. And yes—I enjoyed all of that greatly, but what really struck me about his book, and what made it a story that I will never forget, was his top-notch characterization. Sanderson portrayed some of the deepest, most fully-realized characters that I have ever had the pleasure to encounter. And this, single-handedly, made &#34;Mistborn&#34; one of the finest works out there.
B003477DVK|5.0|The entire family can watch!!! The movie was very entertaining and for many age groups! We as a family loved it!!!
B0015AARJI|3.0|It works perfectly but BE AWARE, there is no charging cable. that comes with it. Had I read closer, I would not have ordered it.
0896898288|5.0|I love traditional quilts and this book gives instructions for beautiful &#34;old&#34; blocks.  The stories add that extra touch to reach the heart.
B00CATSONE|4.0|The truth was told. I felt that end turned a bit into a ad for the authors other book. Overall nicely done.
B005IQZB14|4.0|As I an occasional hiker, I truly enjoyed reading this book and if you like adventure, hiking or backpacking, I think you'll like it too.. It was a WILD adventure!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This is by far the best Michael Jackson concert ever!!!  Billie Jean was his best performance of that particular song of any of his concerts. I don't believe there will any concert that any other artist will be able to match. YOU WILL BE MISSED MJ!!!
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|I like this game but me and my brother think that once you whipe the kids nose it shouldn't just start being runny ten seconds later. But other than that me and my brother both love this app. I'll tell my brother to not play my kindle and he takes it and plays this app every time. You should get this app for you and your siblings.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Way better than any other keyboard I've tried. It rocks. Just like the nWo, this thing is just too sweeeeeet!
B000U7169M|3.0|there was a religious element to the movie and as long as you are comfortable with that it's a good movie. Hilary swank always gives a good performance. and the shipping was fast. no complaints. it was okay.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Great game but too short.  You can finish the game in few hours.  Would have given 5 stars if there were more chapters.
B00BI745AA|1.0|We had looked at about 40 mins of the movie Wednesday night and when we went to finish it Friday night, we saw that the 2 day copyright to watch the movie would expire before we would be able to finish it.  I knew about the 2 day limit.  I thought that as long as you resumed watching it again before the 2 day time period that you could finish the movie.<br /><br />I do get the whole copyright thing but the business model is not good.  I be a lot less like to download a movie from Amazon in the future.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Chosen for our monthly book club book.  Fantastic!  We may plan a road trip to Concordia, KS to see the National Orphan train Museum located there.
B001V9LPY4|5.0|Where the heck is this?  Far too important of a film to not be remastered to blu-ray.  The film is engaging, whimsical and sometimes just creepy.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book looks short, but don't be deceived!  There are so many layers to this book, it may take a few reads to get the whole picture.<br /><br />Reading this will bring you back to your childhood, but not just to the idyllic parts.  It will remind you of the things you once feared as well.
B0061S0A64|5.0|it is boss its so cool and its really good for biggeners but It need more hardcore stuff and you should put it on apple
B009Z59ZNE|4.0|A film difficult to watch in its evolution yet gripping throughout although the final confusion made sense of entire plot  Very good writing and acting throughout.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game for both my kids my son who is 7 was diagnosed with ASD last July and he loves this game
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Great movie! Loved the characters, Made me feel like a Kid. Will watch it again if my wife lets me.
B00957T6X6|3.0|Some may consider this review a SPOILER.  So beware!  I watch Game of Thrones religiously, and wanted to see how the story ends.  Well, I read all 5 books, the story didn't end and at the end of book 5 was the announcement, drum roll please...a book 6 is coming soon.  I don't know if I'll purchase book 6, these books are long and in my opinion, toooooo wordy.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I have been enjoying this a lot.  I recommend this game to anyone who has seen Jurassic Park, and if you haven't this is a very creative idea.  There are no ads even though this is a free game.  The game is very balanced with it's currency, and even though there are in-app purchases you can get 90%+  with the primary currency.  All of the dinosaurs in this game were in the real world in the Jurassic era,  maybe you'll learn something while playing it.
B0058SNNOE|3.0|I have purchased several pairs of Crocs over the years (from the ones that look like wooden shoes, the mammoth clogs (3 pairs) and 3 pairs of velvet covered flats (all size 8) about 12 pairs all told.  I thought if I ordered the same size as the velvet-covered flats I'd be okay.  Not so, not all Croc Flats are created equal.  I wear size 8 1/2, so size 8 is tight and size 9 is a bit big.  I'll wear them even if they're a bit tight but I wish that Crocs had half sizes.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Not a bad hidden oictures game but rather chatty and too often am I encouraged to share stuff with social networking. Easy to say no, but seriously I dont play these kinds of games for the fame.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun and a brilliant idea. It's better than subway surfers sorry if others disagree. I love this game and u will too I think
B006BB8KYU|5.0|If you love the blue and great guitar picking then this is the CD for you. The blend of guitars and other instruments is wonderful, the songs are all well written. I believe this husband and wife team are very under-rated and should be more famous than they are. You won't find better music anywhere.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I love this game but it periodically stops and I have to close it.  It's not a problem with my Kindle Fire as this never happens on any other game.
B000002MIY|4.0|I wouldn't call this record vintage Donald Fagan, but it makes for good listening.  There are as always the catchy rhythms and the avant garde lyrics.  I guess it was a concept album, recorded back in the 90s a few years before the return of Steely Dan with the Grammy winning Two Against Nature, which is up a notch from this one.  If you like Donald Fagan and Steely Dan, you'll probably not be disappointed.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Better writers than I have already commented on this book, and I don't really have anything to add except you will not go wrong<br />making this purchase.  I read the reviews and decided to buy, and I totally enjoyed the read.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|There comes a point in any musician's life when there's nothing much left to do but imitate oneself, or cover stuff written by someone else.  I think Donald Fagan has reached that point in his career; but having said that, it's still head and shoulders above the average noise that gets put out these days.  As usual, there are catchy rhythms and Steely Dan lyrics.  Not bad for an old man, as they say--and that is becoming a theme in DF's lyrics in any case.
B004SDEP38|1.0|I wanted something to write and edit documents.  App description was no good either.  App just not what I wanted for my needs.
0553062182|3.0|Elaine Aron tapped into something quite important: the existence of people (supposedly 15 to 20% of humankind) who are unusually sensitive souls.  By the time this book falls into your hands, you are probably already aware that you are among those who inhabit this tribe.  I found the book to have one foot in the love and light realm, which is what some people are looking for, but I wasn't particularly.  Still, it's a good starting point for exploration into how the sensitive person can navigate their way in a world which is not especially kind to such people.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I laughed. I cried.  It was a quick read and I couldn't put the book down.  Having taken care of others for many years I understood where Will was coming from.
0786891416|4.0|Who knew that the fictional fiction of a tv series would be fun to read. There are a few annoying things (such as repetitions of names, even when not particularly necessary. Good read, anyway. Part of the fun is trying to guess who's the real author...
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|What a unique perspective on zombies. I love how they humanized them & showed how love can be found in unlikely places.
1490313370|3.0|Though provoking. Honest. The reason I gave it 3 stars was because I expected more insight into this topic. But i would recommend it.
1781162646|4.0|as I often do, I loved Stephen King's visit to old-fashioned 'pulp fiction'. I hated to see the story end. It was a quick read compared to the likes of Under The Dome, etc. but a good beach book. Loved that it was in print only, in keeping with the genre' and time period the book represented.
B00CS0XOQW|5.0|This is a new release in the Cafe del Mar series and once again shows why Cafe del Mar is THE leader of the pack when it comes to creating the perfect eclectic mix of atmospheric electronica and moody laid back rhythmic tunes....The artists are often quite obscure (though a typically melancholic Moby features here complete with tinkling piano and Kate Bush turns up on a deep-voiced remix of Running Up That Hill) yet this unknown quantity doesn't detract - the productions are slick and sophisticated, the vibes gloriously relaxed, sometimes primal, sometimes veering towards the spiritual (check out the final track on CD2 by Bliss \\"End Titles\\", and the vocals are calming even if draped over a  beat....This is perfect music for a late night setting, be it in a cafe or at home, and a perfect prelude to nightfall and beyond...
B005R32L66|5.0|I have family living abroad and was spending a fortune on calling cards. I sent them a tablet computer and we are looking forward to our FREE Skype calls !
B000W177GM|5.0|This has always been a standard in my house.  One of my faves for years.  When one wears out, I'm looking to replace it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun and very addictive. My 3-year old loves it and so do I.  It is challenging but is good for all ages.
193700788X|5.0|I really have enjoyed reading the Sookie Stackhouse books and I hate to see the story end but it was done very well. I am actually content with the ending and think that the author did a great job tying up loose ends while keeping the story exciting.
B002T9H2ME|4.0|Sam Rockwell is amazing. Duncan Jones is a director to watch out for. It's amazing what you can do on such a small budget.
B00AR0DN3Y|4.0|A great story about the will to survive. Gives a great look in to the live of a mountaineer and the risks. Reads easily, even for somebody from the netherlands.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|this soundtrack reminds me of Robocop's theme. great movement and sense of urgency. nice for workout or working in the yard.
1451668945|5.0|Great book and my purchase helps out a good cause. The book came quick and was in excellent shape. Didn't even seem used.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I was at a seminar that was for 3 days and lasted 7 hours each day on average. This pack kept my iPhone 5, Bluetooth keyboard and iPad mini working at 100% capacity all day long. I would definitely recommend this charger for anyone who loves using their gadgets to their fullest capacity any time, anywhere. It also fits very easily inside my purse where it can discreetly charge my items for further use throughout the day. Very happy with this purchase, it has saved me more than once with my busy needs
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Saw this movie 3 times in the theater and couldn't wait for the DVD. Will watch it again and again. Love Maggie Smith and the \\"Cissy\\" character.  Billie Connelly never fails to amuse us. Don't turn the DVD off too soon. As the credits roll photos are shown of the real life opera performers as they looked in the movie and in their hay day and list their major accommplishments.
1890517062|5.0|My wife asked me to get this book for her. When she got it, she couldn't put it down until she had finished it and then she past it on tour daughter.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|After the fourth movie I didn't think they can come up with more great stuff to add to the story, but they did.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game really goes the distance! Miles and miles of fun for all ages! hope they make #2 for the new movie! awesome graphics and sound
B005LAII80|5.0|I'll keep this quick, if you love gritty, futuristic, over the top violence and cops hellbent on bringing justice to their town, buy this movie. This is the best movie of its kind since Robocop from the 80's.<br /><br />Sign the petition for the sequel to get made. I did!
0811877485|3.0|I bought these wall decals to use to decorate our dining room wall for our babies 1st birthday. I was really impressed with the quality and colours and they came off really easily two days later. Unfortunately the butterfly and caterpillar decal are folded in the package they are packed in and have very large creases in them. The creases causes them to come off the wall and I found myself having to restick those two decals every couple of hours. This is a shame for an otherwise really great product. We liked them so much that we wanted to move them to my babies room but I couldn't be bothered having to keep re sticking them throughout the day, and what are the other stickers without the caterpillar and butterfly...they are the stars! I tried sticking them to my babies wardrobe which is a wood veneer and hey presto they stick wonderfully and while you can still see where the crease is in the caterpillar and butterfly, they aren't falling off. I am disappointed that I cannot stick them to the walls though. If only Eric Carle products would fix the packaging of this product so that the decals are crease free, then they would have a fantastic product here!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This was great entertainment and having additional information on the discs really helped answer questions that we had about the scenes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|omg this app is hilarious. minions different places this app doesn't even need anything it's already perfect. i looooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeee iiiiiiittttt.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|After muchly anticipating this CD, it has not failed.  It is by far the best CD NKOTB has put out ever.  I especially, love the hidden song they have put on the CD.  Great, great, great purchase
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I'm playing this on my Kindle Fire HD and haven't had any problems with it. I got this as the free app of the day earlier this morning and am still playing it.  Thanks for such a fun game.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The upgrade has made the app better than the old version. I run several locations at the same time ofwhich responds better than before. I have to echo other comments on the battery draining of this app on my Kindle HD. I too will be changing to another app for this reason.
B0090X4GLW|1.0|The music bits sound like somebody was standing way behind the cameras and recording in secret. The primary singers are very very muted and in some can barely be heard. also it is very very cut up and alot of songs were left out. I have never written a bad review but i was so disgusted  with the quality of this i had to warn others.
B000007ODY|5.0|I concur with the lead reviewer in that the recording decisions taken by DG for these performances are deplorable. The BPO sounds as if they are playing in an attic. The sets from the 60's and 80's are both clearly superior.<br /><br />As far as interpretation goes, this set is my favorite, though Karajan always gets 5 stars for Brahms. Here Karajan aims for maximum torque and impetuosity, but not so much that he rushes like with the adagio in the 1st from the late 80's. This approach is the exact same one as those of the Bruckner symphonies he did in 76 and the EMI Wagner from 75, all of which are miraculous. They all sound brutal, violent and heavy, though the heaviness lacks the  faceless stolidity of Bohm, for example.<br /><br />By the mid-late seventies and throughout all of the eighties, Karajan's BPO had reached a level of pefection that surpassed all preceding orchestras and will probably never be matched again. They blast right through the terrible recording quality.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I LOVE WALKING DEAD and I never liked zombie movies or shows before. CANT WAIT TILL SEASON 4. AMAZING WRITING. Keeps you entertained every second.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game. Great time killer and updates are great! Would recommend the kids, adults or anyone! Must have. Can't stop playing
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this game for me but now my four year old plays it more than I get to! But today, it won't get past the tips page and loading/downloading. It's frustrating because I want to play it on my kindle but can't.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is my third copy of this album. People like it so much, they can't help but take it with them when they leave.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Be prepared to read this book in one sitting. It will not be put down. The character's thoughts and cares and fears resonate, and when combined with the supernatural result in a story you do not want to end.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|When I bought this game I thought it would be a simple and quick game. All though the idea is simple. Finishing the game is not simple. I played this game for hours. The different diseases all react differently, which makes the game fun and require lots of strategy. I found that there are different way to win with a disease. I give this game five stars because you can play levels over and over with different results.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you like playing BINGO then you'll love playing this game. It has everything powerups ,tournament game, different levels that can be opened. It's just fun all all the way around. So try it I know you like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is an awesome strategic game that tests you reflexes with trains and barrier. I personally love trying to reach the mission goals. S.S. is all in all, one of the best games that I've ever played!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Wonderful addictive game.  I've played an older version of it on my computer for years and never get tired of it.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|This is a classic film.  By today's standards, it is completely lacking in violence and even sex.  Moreover, it is guilty of being inspiring.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good puzzling game, more levels needed now please. Grandchildren love it, good for all ages. What more can I say!
B009DCOU9S|2.0|It was okay as a find the object game.  The dialogue is long-winded with annoying voice acting.  I largely skipped over those parts.  It can be very fussy about where items are placed.  It is extremely annoying when I would put an object in the correct place only to not have it work.  I ended up resorting to a walkthrough which showed that I was placing items correctly.  The game required up to a dozen tries to get an object to work.  I'm extremely glad I didn't pay for this but annoyed that I wasted time playing it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The movie was very different, I saw it in the theatre twice, you miss so much if you don't watch it several times, that is why I bought the DVD.  Fan of Michael Ball and he was the original Marius.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|What a wonderful show....loved every minute of it.<br />I loved the story and the actors make it so believable,<br />One of the best shows I have ever seen .....
B000OVLIQU|5.0|Probably the best inside look you'll get at how the Beatles developed into the phenomenon they were.  Not to mention the many innovations Emerick devised that recording engineers take for granted today.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I love puzzle games like this, and was very happy with this one. I had to stop and plan ahead, it for me it was the right amount of challenging without being too hard. Wish there were more levels!
B000MV8XPG|2.0|Looks great, a little hard to use unless your little one is 3+, but after 2 months of infrequent use the lever to lock the shovel in place broke and I can't find any info anywhere on replacement parts. Even if I were to find the part, it would mean taking the entire thing apart to replace it. Thought it would be better made considering it's Kettler, or at least easier to find replacement parts. Super bummer.
0142420891|5.0|You HAVE to read the prequel to this before you pick this book up. I highly recommend this book to anyone. If you liked the movie \\"500 Days of Summer\\" you will love this book. Read it all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Didn't read the first book but saw the movie.  If it hadn't been required to sleep and work I would have read it through at one sitting, as it was, it required two.  I hear it is soon to be a movie, plan on watching it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game makes temple run look like Pac man. It is awesome and fast paced and holds my attention for quite a while
B001AXME2S|4.0|This group is a great mix of genres an has a vey unique sound. Very good album. I like it a lot.
B005HED08I|5.0|Ditto - The same as previous review on series<br />Best Star Trek ever!<br />Does not come close to any other Star Trek series.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I bought his game after watching Tabletop where it was played on a show that coursed on quick set up games ( have to love tabletop)<br /><br />This game has some pretty basic and easy o understand rules. The I rest to 13 or more brains wins, you lol dice 3 at a time until you either choose to stop, or get shot enough that its the next persons turn.<br /><br />This is great fun, although the game is advertised for groups of 3+ we play with just 2 of us. Great fun defiantly worth buying
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I wish I could watch a new episode every day. Once a week for part of the year is just not enough.<br />Long live Daryl!
B00CCX9DUG|5.0|I loved this book and can't understand the negative reviews. I'd gone off Ms Gregory for a bit, finding the previous books on the Cousin's wars to be rather dull, too much politics and not enough personal stories or narrative. But this book has it all - a gripping story, lots of interesting and complex relationships and just enough politics. The themes examined are fascinating - the nature of deception, loyalty, the meaning of family. The threats to the throne are relentless, and Henry is shown as a flawed, weak and afraid individual, in contrast to Elizabeth, with her inner strength and unerring instinct for preservation. So - loved it! Well worth a read.
B00846REIS|2.0|But i did feel like i was reading 50 shades again.Just that Christian Grey is visually hotter in description than Gideon Cross
B003G4W49C|5.0|Couldn't stop reading this book. Great read for young people and older people.<br />Definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes sci-fi.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I have seen the first movie and instantly fell in love unfortunately I have not seen Despicable Me2 yet but am hopefully seeing it soon .My friend showed me  Despicable Me: Minion Rush and I loved it. Its a great game and I am very happy with it.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|This card works perfectly. Has plenty of capacity for the photos that I take with room to spare. I love being able to review the photos to ensure the came out OK.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have already tried a Roku and an Apple TV but never found the functionality I desire.  I've ended up with a HTPC and never been happier.  However, I thought the Chromecast was worth a try due to its small form factor and low price.<br /><br />The device came very neatly packaged, much like most Apple products.  I knew HDMI v1.4 was required to power the device, but I had not taken the time to research my TV's capability.  The device did not power up immediately, so I knew I needed to add power via the supplied micro USB cable.<br /><br />Once powered up I followed the instructions listed on my screen and used my iPhone (4S model, iOS 6.1.3) to setup.  I found some of the prompted steps lacking information and struggled to change the SSID of my router but realized I should be changing my phone to connect to the Chromecast SSID. Not a big deal, whoever expected electronics instructions to be well written? However this is where the problem began.<br /><br />The Chromecast found the appropriate wireless network and asked for password.  After six attempts, it finally accepted my password and I was able to move on.  I was then prompted to switch back to the internet connected SSID.  This took three tries without avail before I went back to the Chromecast SSID to re-perform the previous step.  It finally connected on this fourth (or is it 10th try?)<br /><br />My iPhone then told me how I could use my Chromecast through my phone.  I tried the Chrome browser at first, but there was no mirror capability present. I guess Google hasn't pushed an App update out yet, no big deal.  I then tried Netflix (the main reason for the Chromecast in my opinion,) and found the mirror feature ready and waiting.  This was the only positive thing I've seen yet with the device.  However things continued downhill from there.<br /><br />I selected a show and it just  hung (loading) for over a minute before I backed out to try again.  On second try the show synced and started playing.  The resolution was poor (480) as the buffer needed to fill to get to high definition (1080.)  HD was enabled within the first 30 seconds, but that's when I noticed the real failure of the device: audio sync.  The audio-video sync was off, enough to make me cease watching. I've yet to determine the offset needed to sync, but I wound expect much, much better from a plug'n'play device from Google.  Pausing and restarted did not improve the sync issues.<br /><br />I turned off the Chromecast and booted my HTPC.  I had high hopes for the Chromecast, but an HTPC cannot be beat.<br /><br />I'll try Chromecast in another few months, hopefully things improve.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/8/2013: After applying update 12480 I saw no improvement in the audio sync.  However I did discover that the direct cause of the audio sync issue was due to selecting a show on Netflix that I had already watched one half.  After selecting new content to start from the beginning, the audio was properly synced.  I've increased my rating to three stars as this is a less obnoxious bug now that I've identified the direct cause.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Enjoy this show immensely! Was very upset that Mathew Crawley was killed off, but can't wait to see where it goes.
B006X08FDA|5.0|I saw this group at the Grand Ole Opry this summer. They sang two tracks from this particular CD and I was sold. I wanted to buy the CD right there and then but the line was too long, so I bought it at Amazon instead.<br />I have enjoyed becoming familiar with this type of singing and must admit that the songs grow on you. All together a great CD with very talented musicians.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I had missed it in the movie theaters, so I was still expecting a five-star big screen motion picture. It was a good movie, but not as exciting as I had expected and heard. Four stars it is.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Beautifully written, I couldn't put this book down, though it isn't a mystery novel.  The characters were so well developed, I felt t.ike I knew them personally by then end of the book.  Deals with the delicate subject of assisted suicide in a sensitive and realistic way.  I loved every minute of this book, even the parts I cried through
B0090SI582|3.0|Not a terribly bad movie but it is slow from beginning to end where it picks up a bit but left me wondering what the writers, producers, and director had in mind because I was lost from beginning to end.<br /><br />I never read the comics as a kid so I don't know the detailed story that most of you have with Marvel Universe so please bear with me if you think I'm being too critical of this movie.<br /><br />It starts out borrowing the storyline from the '70s TV show Grizzley Adams which I enjoyed; since I really enjoyed that TV show as a kid from what I can remember of it, just wondering if the bear in this movie was named Ben like the one in the TV show.<br /><br />As for the atom bomb scene, I can believe Wolverine would survive the blast (under Marvel Universe rules) but the Japanese soldier he sheltered from the blast would have been cooked to a crisp since he had no Mutant super powers, no doubt.  I know it's science fiction, but keep it believable from the real-life aspects that apply, that way you're not insulting the intelligence of the audience for the sake of entertainment value.  It reminded me of the ridiculous scene from the beginning of the last Indiana Jones movie where he survives a nuclear blast from ground zero by hiding in a lead-lined refrigerator.  The lead may have sheltered him from the radiation but the heat from the blast would have cooked him to a crisp and the crash landing would have totally destroyed his burnt corpse to pieces since he had no restraints inside that frig to keep his body from being violently tossed around.<br /><br />The rest of the Japanese storyline reminded me of various other borrowed movie storylines like Kill Bill, The Hunted, Shogun, and Karate Kid but nowhere near as entertaining because like I first mentioned this is a very slow movie.<br /><br />The fight scene at the end really annoyed me when it comes to believability because when the old Japanese guy superheats his adamantium sword to cut off Wolverine's claws made no sense because when you superheat metal it loses it's strength properties and becomes soft/pliable.  So that scene should have had him trying to cut off Wolverine's claws but cutting his sword in half or pieces instead since Wolverine's claws would be stronger than the sword.<br /><br />I think the writers got the sword-making process confused because you do have to superheat the sword to glowing red and quickly cool it by dousing it in water to temper it; it's part of the carbon steel-making process which traps/packs the carbon atoms tighter than just letting it cool normally (which would make a weak brittle knife/sword) and it's how all tempered knives are made.  The History Channel has an excellent documentary on Japanese Samuri Sword Making and manufacturing knives and other bladed tools which is what I'm using as a reference and the movie The Hunted does an excellent job at presenting the process from an entertaining/dramatic drunken swordmaker's point of view.  I know adamantium is not steel (it's actually a ficticous metal alloy created by Marvel Universe) but it is metal nonetheless and has to share the same basic metalurgic properties as all other metals whether real or fictitious.<br /><br />I know the purists are going to attack this post but please remember I never read the comics or any book adaptations of this series so I don't know what Marvel Universe's view on physics both real and theoretical is.  I do know that from a general science fiction point of view you have to bend some of it but to make it belieable you have to keep it grounded to the extent that it's not ridiculous which is what most early science fiction TV shows and movies did, but what I've seen from most of the other X-Men movie material, they didn't take it too far to be completely unbelievable or insulting the intelligence of the viewers.<br /><br />Unfortunately I didn't catch the Easter Egg and the end of the movie so I'll wait 'till it's out on Blu-ray and hopefully if asequel is made they ratchet up the pace a bit because I almost fell asleep during this movie.sequel is made they ratchet up the pace a bit because I almost fell asleep during this movie.

B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is a current favorite due to the effort put forth, the laid back lifestyle,and the journey of Rodriguez which compliment the music.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is very entertaining. I can't stop playing. I would recommend this game. Hope this helps. Got to get back to the game.<br />  ,
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It's a great concept, and the narrative arc is well timed. But the writing is incredibly amateur. The reader is constantly Told what is going on, instead of being shown. Not enough room to let the imagination do its work.<br />That said, I will definitely read the trilogy. It's a great idea.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|The coolest game I have ever played<br />Or seen all the different key holes and awesome characters good hiding places. I was sad when it was over the mystery was nail biting

B0087ITBT8|4.0|It was a very good funny movie. We all laughed  a lot and  Streisand i thought was good in it.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Totally entertaining. New twist to typical object search games. Hope they come out with a #3! Not too easy but doesn't frustrate you either.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|This movie was ok but no where near as good as i thought it was going to be. I was surprised since  i thought it was going to be a really great movie with Theron.

B00821OX98|5.0|My 17 year old twin grandsons made me put this series in my watch list.  I wasn't looking forward to watching this series.  But after watching the first few episodes of season 1, I couldn't stop watching it!  Very well written tv series that keeps you at the end of your chair.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Having seen both seasons of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock, was prepared not to settle for an Americanized version. However, this is a well written and well acted series that does not disappoint.

159463176X|5.0|Please stop making us cry.  Please stop luring us into falling in love with your characters... only to have us watch helplessly as tragedy befalls them.  Please stop reminding us of how imperfect, how very flawed, how unforgiving and harsh the natural course of human life can be.  We KNOW!  We read books so that, at long last, we can watch as something good happens to good, deserving people.  You are brilliant, Mr. Hosseini, brilliant.  (By the way, so is your copy editor--this book was flawlessly edited.  Kudos to him!)  So... can the next book be about how really bad, seemingly capricious incidences occur that separate unique, loving people--but they man up and find a way back to each other???  Please???<br />P.S. Thanks for the incredibly great read.  You owe me a box of tissues.  And maybe a bottle of wine.
B00AH8U3UC|4.0|After a long hiatus the show is just as good if not better than previous seasons. Can't wait to see how hank deals with being poisoned by the ex-girlfriend.

B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Fey is a talented  lady ......but...she tries too hard in her book to be amusing on every page...I found  it more like comedy skits as opposed to a personal take.

B004UPANAI|5.0|this movie is great and it shows you why wolverine is so ... wolverine. and its too bad I only bought the trial, I don't have enough for the full movie. I do not want to spoil anything so I will not say anything except I love wolverine and this movie

0385341008|4.0|This is a smooth text dealing with qualified difficult problems.<br /><br />A comparison. I will compare it to two other books on 5 criteria. The book: Andr&eacute; Gide \\"The Counterfeiters\\" deals with the identity of authors, the Guernsey book deals with the identity of pig farmers. Pascal Mercier: \\"Night train to Lisbon\\" deals with a German teacher that takes the night train to Lisbon to solve a mystery of a Portugese doctor that lived during the Salazar dictatorship. In the Guernsey book Miss Juliet Ashton goes to Guernsey to solve the mystery of the \\"Guernsey literary and potato peel pie society.\\" that \\"existed\\" during the German occupation of the island.<br /><br />A literary quality scale: To me, a good book should i) contain some \\"quotable sentences\\", that is, sentences that give a surprising insight into a common piece of fact.  ii) It should deal with an interesting theme, iii) you should be involved in the characters and fear for their future, and lastly iv) the story reminds you of a symphony with all its movements. For the 3 books: Guernsey, Counterfeiters and Night train I found the following scores: G = 38: (2; 8; 10; 10; 8); C = 26 (7, 1, 2, 8, 8); NT = 29 (2, 10, 4, 8, 5). So much for numerical calculation; I think I enjoyed the three books equally much, but for different reasons and at different times.<br /><br />The Guernsey book: I did not find many quotable sentences, but many funny episodes (\\"Elisabeth isn't tall, so those pistols were pointing at her eyes ...\\"p. 26).  The dilemmas facing Juliet are the dilemmas during war and occupation: (Elizabeth, after seeing a troop of goose-stepping soldiers \\"Finally, Elizabeth said, \\"I have seen enough. I need a drink.\\" (p. 122)) and the authors suggest interesting solutions. I am taken in by Juliet, who probably also are Elizabeth, except that, unlike in \\"Harry Potter\\" you can't spell Juliet backwards and get Elizabeth. The letter format of the book was novel to me, I was a little suspicious if it could last to the end, and it couldn't. So the authors made a twist, not too convincing, but good enough.<br /><br />I have a hypothesis: Texts with many quotable sentences are also texts where the fate of the characters becomes uninteresting. I didn't care what happened to the figures in Andr&eacute; Gides \\"The counterfeiters\\", but I was interested in knowing if Juliet found her life.<br /><br />The book is easy to read, but the text makes you stop and think more often than you would anticipate.last to the end, and it couldn't.

B009OYSFDM|4.0|I am was and am a big fan of Smallville So when I heard they were doing this series I was a little not interested since it wasnt Justin Hartley in the role. So I didnt start watching until a month ago. Its a different take. Edgier & grittier. And Stephen Amell is quite good. I'd say even better than Justin. I also re-watched the episode of Smallville in season 8 that deal with Oliver's time on the island. Now granted Smallville wasnt about Oliver so they didnt devote the time/budget that Arrow does, but you get a LOT more of the character development here(obviously). And yeah it takes liberties with Green Arrow canon, but is that such a big deal? If you dont know a lot about the comics, its still a great ride & lots of good action to boot. I recommend. :)

B002RXHW6S|1.0|We ordered it on June 10th of this year. This was great fun for a few weeks. It burst after about 5 weeks. They won't take it back. Still only seven weeks old, but &#34;Not Eligible for Return&#34;. We didn't expect it to last forever, but one month (that's all they guarantee, so they know it isn't a good product) is quite short. Ridiculous that there is no way to protest other than to write a review that is harsh but absolutely true.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Please tell me this is not the end of the Camel Club!  Being a \\"baby boomer\\" and my husband being a Vietnam Vet, it is rare that  an  author the caliber of David Baldacci would create a character of that era and portray him as a hero; a man of conscience.  All the characters are fleshed out beautifully and the storyline keeps me eagerly turning pages.  I would recommend this book to anyone. Please bring back John.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Cloud Atlas is such a mythic archetypal story with such superb acting that it's one of the ten best movies I've ever seen. This movie shows how we fail, succeed, and everything in-between as part of our growth process. It is comforting for me.  Set in differing times and places, past, present, and future, it is filled with action, more violence than I prefer, but it does not glorify violence at all.  Laugh-out-loud funny, touching, inspiring, and amazing, since the movie inspired and touched me so, I purchased it for my closest friends and family to relish.  This was a copy I gave as a gift. In these busy times I haven't gotten feedback from my friends and family, so this may bode ill. But, for a retired RN/MFT Wiccan, it's one of the very best available.

B009DCOU9S|4.0|I downloaded this game \\"Magic Academy 2\\" to my Android with no problems.  It is a very good missing objects game.  And it's much longer than most. I am very pleased with it.
B007X4ECMI|4.0|This movie was excellent. I wouldn't necessarily call it an action film, though. There are elements of action, but I would label it more a space drama. There is the under-current of romance between Pearce and Grace, and the love/hate relationship between the convict brothers is explored to a minor degree. I must say I found it strange to see Guy Pearce with muscles, but he does make a good semi-action hero.<br /><br />The storyline was familiar - as usual these days - but still enjoyable. The relationship between Grace and Pearce was strange, in some ways. She was very child-like, and him even more so. I suppose that tension between them is necessary for character development more than anything else. The main bad guy (I forget his name) was excellent at being a psychopath. I really enjoyed his performance, however it was pretty obvious that his deranged brother was going to kill him in the end (spoiler alert!)<br /><br />Good action scenes, watchable characters, though the ending was very familiar as well. There is always a big explosion at the end, just as the good guys escape with seconds to spare. The difference with this one was that they didn't escape in a pod.<br /><br />Overall, worth watching if you can get past Guy Pearce as the action-hero.
0553801473|4.0|Not up to par with the first three in the series, but an improvement on the 4th novel. Worth it.
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|This film was so disappointing. Great cast, terrible plot, terrible acting by Depp (who really can't be anything other than a pirate these days), and no surprises. Was I the only person who knew he was the guy from the start? Jolie made it so obvious when she picked him on the train. Their on-screen romance was not convincing at all, I didn't find Depp charming or funny ... I found him annoying. Jolie is always amazing, she is the only thing in this film that I credit 2 stars with. If I were you, I would avoid this film.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|IT IS ANOTHER GOOD ONE.... I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE ANY SPOILERS... SO THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY
B004LWZW7E|4.0|Honestly, this movie was great. I love the concept and how time has been commodified. The blend of science and nature is interesting and the action sequences are great. Cillian Murphy is great as the jaded detective, Amanda Seyfried tries to get into character but I think she stumbles every now and then, and Timberlake is a good actor, but struggles to acknowledge loss in the way I was hoping.<br /><br />This movie is basically a Robin Hood of the future type thing. For me the concept really works, but it could have been a lot stronger in parts. The characters needed some work, but the film did make an interesting comment on society, which I thought was actually quite profound. Good film!
B00C2IN76C|5.0|I LIKED IT AS A MOVIE SO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE EXTENDED VERISON.. MY WIFE LIKES ANY FILM THAT SHOWS MEN NAKED SINCE THE MOVIES ARE FILLED WITH WOMEN NUDITY... PROBABLY A CONSPIRACY OF SMALL SIZED JEWISH MEN RUNNING HOLLYWOOD... BUT THEY HAD 20% OFF AT BIRTH... BUT A GREAT MOVIE AND ACTION FILLED... NOT YOUR TYPICAL COMIC BOOK HEROS.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|Some remakes are rubbish - we all know that - but this one does the original proud. Farrell has that look of nice-guy-next-door yet sinister murderer thing going on, which was fun to watch, and Yelchin as an up-and-coming talent was fantastic. I enjoyed his psycho best friend (he added some really interesting humorous scenes), and the action was very satisfying. Toni Collette is always a nice addition to any film, and she was quite funny as well, though in a subtle way.<br /><br />This film was definitely worth doing, the special effects were well done and the thrills were fun and exciting. Great film!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|ANOTHER GREAT MOVIES SERIES THAT GOT BETTER WITH EACH NEW MOVIE.... A MUST HAVE... SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS OWNING
B002ZG99N6|4.0|Ben Affleck is an interesting talent. Is he better at acting or directing? Maybe he's equally good at both. I believe he wrote this one, as well, so there's the trifecta!<br /><br />It's a great love story wrapped in a drama wrapped in a crime thriller. Affleck's character is conflicted throughout the film, wanting to get out of the life he's built for himself, and his love interest (Rebecca Hall) is easy to watch on the screen. Her character is strong, but she's also traumatised by her ordeal at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that it suggest love conquers all - even betrayal. For me, the ending was not realistic, but it's subjective. You might find it satisfying and romantic. Definitely watch it and make up your own minds :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so cool like totally A.W.E.S.O.M.E. El Macho is so cool 5star for 5hours in playing the AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!!!! minion costumes are SO cool!!!!
B0009MDPYW|4.0|Reeves is excellent at being the jaded hero, the special effects were awesome and a young Shia LeBouf (transformers) was comic as always in his brief but potent cameo.<br /><br />The storyline is your basic angels versus demons type thing, of course the only one who can save the world is the guy who got booted out of hell. The typical genre is transmuted, though, as Reeves is quite selfish. He's really only going through the motions in order to redeem himself. His character goes through some serious changes throughout the film, though, which made Reeves interesting to watch.<br /><br />I must say, too, that Tilda Swinton is amazing as always, and I enjoyed seeing her wings get ripped off. She's one angry angel! Rachel Weisz is an under-rated actress, but she really shone in this film as the suffering victim trying to avenge her sister's life.<br /><br />This film also restored my faith in Reeves as an actor - after the Matrix I wondered how we even made it to Hollywood (that's content for another review, though) - so this one is really worth watching. Great film.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|My father was a navigator on a B17 during WWII. I just finished transcribing his daily journal and through that, discovered a new appreciation for the sacrifices that his generation made in the cause of freedom. A follower of my blog about his journal recommended this book to me. Having immersed myself into my dad's daily events during his WWII service time, I was primed to read more.<br /><br />While some see this book as giving a pass to the Third Reich, I see this book as chronicling the lives of two men, Franz Stigler, the German who chose honor over country, and Charlie Brown, the B-17 pilot struggling to bring his wounded ship and crew home. They were brought together in an improbable situation where one had the power of life and death over the other. In the words of Charlie Brown, the true hero in the story is Stigler.<br /><br />I found the book to be written well essentially divided into three segments, the life of Franz Stigler, the life of Charlie Brown, and the unlikely circumstances that brought them together in later life where they found a common bond of brotherhood.<br /><br />War is a terrible activity. Accounts of honorable acts such as this do not remove the horror of war. We can, however, find hope that goodness can be found in our hearts despite evil that may surround us.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Lots of people assume this is a direct prequel to Alien. Ok, it's set in the same universe, but it's a different film. It begins to explore the history of the Xenomorphs, and the creation of the human. Some of the scenes are similar, but the movie is markedly different to the Alien series. The design of the monster at the end was different, too. I loved the visual effects, and Noomi Rapace proves she can be something other than the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo! Acting was superb, storyline brilliant, Charlize Theron gets squashed, what else can you ask for??<br /><br />I didn't find the film boring at all, I really appreciated the history it was aiming to uncover and the various characters that appeared in the film. If you want to watch it as an Alien prequel, you'll probably hate it, but if you watch it for what it is - a film in and of itself - then you might quite possibly love it as much as I do.
B002ZG974M|5.0|My toddler and I like to watch this movie together. It's really sweet and interesting to see the first year of life in several different cultures. A feel good movie for sure.
B002NZK5RI|4.0|This film was an excellent serial killer movie. In parts it was quite claustrophobic and others it seemed to traverse into your own living room. The sense of isolation in this film is spectacular, as is the notion of the serial killer having fans. Obviously this does happen, but it translated well onto the screen. Sigourney Weaver was killer as always.<br /><br />Definitely worth watching
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has a lot of great turns and twists to it.  Once I started reading it, the book was hard to put down.  I was a little disappointed with the ending.
B004A8ZX28|3.0|What's with Neeson's big return to the screen? He's everywhere these days! I'm just waiting for 'Unknown 2: I Don't Know'<br /><br />Honestly, I did enjoy this film, but the whole 'I've got amnesia and I'm really a swell guy' has been done to death. There were no surprises in this movie, but it was produced well and had some good scenes in it. For me it's worth a look, but it's not a very exciting movie.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|Greatest zombie horror movie ever. I watched it 3 times almost made me cry. Great actors and wonderful plot. It has will smith what else could you want.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|This was one of those films that surprised me - the first time I saw it, I thought - how stupid! - but I watched it again and it grew on me. It's nice to see the heroine who actually did commit the crime, even if she was possessed at the time.<br /><br />Really, this film has everything a good thriller needs - a good mystery, twists and turns, and a character we really feel for. At times we begin to question Berry's sanity, which makes the ending even more exciting. The haunting / possession (whichever you want to call it) is not the scary thing about this movie. The scary thing is the psycho's that live next door, and the ones we are married to! It makes the audience quiver at the thought that anybody could be a sadistic killer, which is one of the main things I enjoyed about this film.<br /><br />Basically, it is a great film that traces the descent into near madness of both the protagonist and the viewer. It was reminiscent of In Dreams to an extent, minus the strong symbolism. Definitely worth a watch, though it also does have a few cheap thrills. You'll know what I mean when you watch it (how long can you hold your breath???)
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I have the original Star Trek movies and am glad they have come out with when the crew was just starting out.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|This sequel was much better than the first one. I was actually really disappointed in the first Sherlock Holmes, so I didn't expect much from this one. It was exciting, it was funny, it had lots of action, and it showed more of Holmes' character than I thought it would. It was a great film. I still have reservations about Downey Jr. playing Holmes - and Law as the sidekick - but they get through it ok and are eventually believable.<br /><br />Worth watching.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My husband and I played together. It was really enjoyable and challenging. We got so addicted and was disappointed there was only 10 levels.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|This film was fantastic. It was highly reminiscent of the original, but I think that may have the point. After all, it was a prequel. The design of the spaceship was visually stunning, the characters were mostly unlikeable, but that made me empathise with Winstead's character all the more. The only female in the part of the world, and she kicked butt! I really enjoyed how they tied it so wonderfully to the original - the ending mainly (with the helicopter and the dog running away).<br /><br />The acting was brilliant, the special effects were very good (not amazing, but still very good), and the plot, although familiar, was excellent. The plot had to be familiar, because it was leading to the original, but I enjoyed how they opened the narrative to the discovery of the alien and the space ship etc.<br /><br />Very well done, I recommend this film for those who enjoyed the original, and those who enjoy a good sci-fi
B0007LXPBI|5.0|This was a great price for an old favorite.  It's in good shape and now I have this movie as well.
6305428050|4.0|Do you ever wonder how the 80s and 90s produced hilarious films without crossing the line? This film is one of those, good clean humour and it still manages to create that edge of excitement - and at times, fear. A young Elizabeth Shue really shines in this film; the plot is a little 'convenient', i.e. there is no real reason to leave the house, but a friend of the babysitter's is in real trouble! It's a great ride, lots of funny characters, and by the end you feel like you've been on the ride with them, rather than just watching it.<br /><br />If you have young kids around 10, show them this one so they know what real humour is. It's also funny just to observe the differences in fashion and music etc. Great film
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|The dinosaurs in the game are awesome and all except when there's an exclusive dinosaur for some reason it costs bucks instead of coins. . . probably because they want you spent hundreds of money!!!  (even though the game is free)You see you have to spend REAL money to get bucks to pay for example, amargasaurus. BUT BUCKS COST A FORTUNE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's like criminal!!!!!!!!!!!!! Look the game is great for anyone. . . except if you don't like spending money.
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|The film was ok. If you want to watch Bruce Willis shoot people, then watch this movie. Or any other movie he's ever been in. The fourth film in the series was great (totally unrealistic, but an awesome action flick), whereas this one was really let down by all the nagging from the son. He's supposed to be some secret agent, yet he can't sense when something's wrong, he has no intuition, and he spends nearly the whole movie complaining about how much Bruce Willis sucked as a father. Of course by the end (as with the other films) the relationship has been repaired and they walk off into the distance as best friends.<br /><br />For me, this film was not worth making. It was barely worth watching. The action scenes were good, and it was interesting (I guess) to see McClain in Russia, but it was basically like watching any of the other Die Hard movies. My favourite scene was where McClain pushes the bad guy off the roof and they shoot it the same way as when Alan Rickman was pushed off the roof all those years back. This made me wonder if they were planning on rebooting the whole series with the son as the main character. (Oh god no!)<br /><br />Overall, basic action film that really is only worth watching if you like Bruce Willis or the son (whose name I can't remember - Jai?).
B003YUC2FE|4.0|ALL WAS GREAT WITH THIS FANTASTIC SET!  AWESOME IN EVERY WAY my kids loved it and still love it today
B004EPZ08O|5.0|This instalment of the Final Destination series is more than worthy, it redeemed it! FD4 was really disappointing on so many levels, but this one was exciting and had great thrills and death scenes in it. The added dimension of the psycho killer was great as well, making us wonder if by killing someone we are intervening in death's plan or fulfilling it? Do we steal 50 years or 10 minutes?? It was great, because it made it harder to determine what was going to happen next.<br /><br />There were hints throughout the film of what the ending was going to be, so for me there was no surprise in that, but my partner was shocked, so I guess some people might not see it coming haha. Definitely worth watching, I'm glad they made this one, instead of leaving the franchise on the depressing low left by FD4.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|As in other books I have read by him, it seemed to start out slow. However, I was suddenly caught up in the fantasy & the fast pace of the book. A fun ride in time & space.
0307463745|5.0|What a great book to get you started in rethinking which helps push you out of the typical and puts you into the unique/legendary category! Loved this material!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Helps me keep up and send information to my friend and family.  This is a good app, recommend you get it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Awesome device!!! Love it!!!! Very fast and beautiful picture....just wish you could have added a sd card slot to save pictures to.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|First off, the picture shown is not the hub I have. Mine is a square with a USB port on each side. It works perfectly with my 3.0 peripherals and also my 2.x and 1.x oldies, too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a cliffhanger. I love this trilogy and can hardly wait for Mockingjay. The characters are likable and the story is very well written. A real page turner.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I find the game to be very stimulating. You really have to think outside of the box. I wish we could place the letters in random order instead of the beginning to end.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|this monitor is just amazing, the sound quality from the mic and from it's own speaker is great. Image quality is also great and the most important feature is the ability to see your baby from any place which any of your apple or android devices, also you can have three accounts to access the app and watch the baby, but still you can use a single account on all your personal devices.<br />The only issue is the delay due to the internet speed, which I hope will get solved with the new app updates
B00E193Y36|5.0|FFDP seems to just get better and better with each album. This one does not disappoint. The Deluxe Edition is well worth a few extra bucks.
B00190N4E4|5.0|I never knew much of the history of Gandhi who I found to be by turn by brilliant and unorthodox. Clearly a man of passion who made a difference.
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|If you like Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise then you'll love this movie. This was a true disappointment. It had such potential. But the film is all special effects and predictable plot twists.<br /><br />Don't bother.
B009M588K8|5.0|I bought this in an airport for a good reason the plane ride home.  I couldn't put it down once I started reading.  The author does a great job of creating a narrative that can be visualized in your mind as you read.  He is careful to disguise names, but still allow you to follow the path to the mission to capture or kill UBL.  I am glad a few gentleman like &#34;Mark&#34; and Chris Kyle have written books to allow us civilians a glimpse into their world.  Highly recommended to read both.
B0051GOB26|5.0|How can you ever go wrong upgrading your favorite movie from DVD to Blue Ray, but you get cool extra stuff with it.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This game is a lot of fun...I enjoy games like this, that make me use my Brain, to solve Puzzles, and such...It's challenging, but at the same time, it's extremely frustrating!  I've finally conquered the \\"Robot\\" without using any of my Orbs, only to get to Puzzle 7 \\"Voodoo\\" (in Chapter 4) where I've completed everything in that Puzzle, but am now stuck 'cause I can't get the Pins to work on the \\"Voodoo Doll\\" in the Picture!<br /><br />I place the Pins, where the Circles indicate, but absolutely NOTHING happens!  They ought to make it so that you can use 1 pin at a time, and not have to pick up all 3 Pins, together!  I have 13 minutes left, to figure out how to get those Stupid Pins to work on that \\"Voodoo Doll\\" picture...If I can't figure it out, I'm going to have to start Chapter 4 all over, again!  :o{<br /><br />Has anyone else had that same problem, while playing this game, on their Kindle Fire?  How did you finally get the Pins to work?  Thank you for the Help!  :o}
B009JBZH54|5.0|How do you make the man in your life the envy of all his friends? Buy this trilogy. It is well worth the prize and your significant other will be very appreciative.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Interesting story and had so much potential but Tom<br />was either not the best choice (very stilted) or he<br />took understated a bit too far
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|This was a good movie. I think my wife liked it better than i did, but it is worth watching.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Always keen on Gerard Butler - no disappointment here - great family story with<br />outstanding visual effects. Reminds me a bit of Keanu and Patrick in Point Break
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great book. I liked it a lot. Will read against son as I get my next chance! Let's go, yes!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I hadn't read much about the movie before watching and Wow! was<br />it a ride. The story, the cinematography, the actors - all make for a seamless<br />heart wrenching drama with an outstanding ending. A must see for any family!
B009AP2G26|5.0|I like how the characters are adapting to graduating from high school. They are going through normal life changes and responding how &#34;the average&#34; kid would.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Going into a Tarantino movie is always a bit of a<br />nail biter for me. You never quite know what's<br />going to come at you....no exception here...
B0082SU98U|5.0|Very easy to reading. Beautiful story, which teach us to be more happy. And people may to be other, than seem at first look.
B0018RE7DU|5.0|American Gigolo was my first movie as an adult of<br />18. Need I say more. Revisiting it 35 years later<br />took years off my attitude - he's still just as luscious<br />now as he was then....
B008220BLG|5.0|It was a very cute romantic comedy. Not a total chick flick. I really liked the story and Nicholas Hoult was great.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Season 2 provides rich narrative and splendid<br />acting across the board. My only - slight criticism<br />is if I had not read the novels to fill in some of the<br />relationship depth of characters Game of Thrones 2<br />might seem a bit on the tawdry and mind candy side
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I saw the movie, read the Hunger Games then kept on reading. The trilogy is well written, full of suspense and also innocence. Katniss and Peeta are wonderfully described characters that feel real, in fact elements of this book Mockinjay feel so real as if our world is heading into epic destruction only we don't have a beautiful, brave Mockingjay with an enormous heart. It is a fast but excellent read.
0071766588|4.0|Its has everything you need to pass the test, you ony have to have time to study... thats you part !
B005LFQRTC|3.0|I probably liked it better as a kid. Some episodes are not very interesting to me at all. I like it ok
1401937519|5.0|Once I started reading this book I could't put it down.  Anita was a Hindu who grew up in Hong Kong and attended Catholic Schools.  By trying to keep pace with the various conflicting cultures and please the people in her life she developed numerous self limiting beliefs and lost her sense of self along the way.  After battling cancer for four years and crossing over to near death during a thirty hour coma she uncovered the interconnectivity of all things as well as the magnificence each person already has within them.<br /><br />I related to the author's experience unlike any book before.  Her perspective helped me shed some old dogmatic programming and to better articulate my personal spiritual stance.<br /><br />We are so much greater than this physical experience and the mental filter through which we view the world.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone on a spiritual path seeking ways to grow through joy rather than pain and struggle.<br /><br />Love + Light
0061730335|5.0|Cleverly written, entertaining, and full of humanity. I recommend Mr. Kamkwamba's story as a gift for all ages, a story that inspires and your young readers it shows us the humility they need to learn and the potential within them all. Higly HIGHLY Recommend this book.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Great movie!  Loved the story line, the witches were cool!  I loved the brother/sister bond.  This is worth the money!!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This is a great movie. There are small differences from the book but still close enough to enjoy. There are some graphic battle scenes so it may not be suitable for small children due to violence.
B0019IOZGC|5.0|classic movie i love it. great job by all the actors. NOT FOR CHILDREN. good to watch every now and then
0316228583|1.0|The dialog is about as riveting as watching paint dry. I bought this book because of her success with her other books but I think she should stick to writing for adolescents.<br />The book also has  distinct British colloquialisms in it which I recognize having been married to a Brit for over 20 years. This may work for Harry Potter stuff but adds to the \\"tea time\\" mentality of the book.  Don't waste your money.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|... on TV.  DVD.  Streaming.  Anywhere.  Anyhow.<br /><br />The finest acting, direction around.  Bravo, and can't wait until Season 4.  Will seem like an eternity.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Decent game. Targeting is a bit iffy at times. Sometimes requiring numerous attempts to get the click to register properly. Has been at least slightly amusing and engaging.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Compared to hidden object games I've played in the past (such as Ravenwood), this game just doesn't hold my interest.<br /><br />Let's start out with the pluses:<br />* The graphics are beautiful. I played this on a 8.9\\" Fire HD. The pictures were sharp and colorful.<br />* I haven't played too may of these games were you have to open cabinets or drawers to find things, so I thought that was interesting.<br />* There is something of a continuing storyline.<br />* The puzzles are mildly challenging and entertaining<br /><br />The minuses:<br />* As has been discussed heavily in other reviews, the lengthy dialogue between actually playing the game gets a bit old. Not only that, but the dialogue itself is wretchedly written.<br />* In traditional \\"find all the objects portions\\" you are only searching for four objects at a time. You get four outlines of the objects, and as you find one it is replaced in the outline list by a new one.<br />* For the most part, the objects are not that cleverly hidden. Objects are generally very distinct from the background, and the pictures are just not all that full of objects to the point where they are hard to pick out. Some might regard this as a plus. LOL<br />* Some of the on screen puzzles are a bit inane. Also they may be a bit too picky about where you place \\"tool objects\\". On one screen I had already tried the tool in the place it needed to be used. I finally resorted to a clue and it showed me the spot I'd already tried. So I needed to position it slightly differently, but still on top of the image in the area I'd already tried.<br /><br />I lost interest after the fourth \\"chapter\\".
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like this app because it's very addictive and I love this game so you should get it. Also when my daughter saw me playing this game she wanted to play the game right away
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|I finished the book but did not care for the content. It wasn't a bad story but weird that she considered the chimp her sister. Not that into animals. I like cats and that is about it.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Like I said In my title I typically do not play these kinds of games, in fact I always thought they would be boring. However once I started playing g this I could not stop! It is challenging but not too much so. The background music is nice and it incredibly fun and addicting. I would recommend it to anyone. Especially if u have never played this type of game before. I can't wait for new levels to be added on.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse Moon shadow is beautiful, it's thanks to the graphics. I have always wanted A horse,now I have one, this game calms my nerves<br />I recommend this game

B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Beautiful execution, a good concept, and puzzles that are tough enough to be interesting but won't make you pull your hair out.  Totally worth a buck! I hope to see more levels soon.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|I downloaded this album because it was free. I think Taylor Swift is an uncannily good businesswoman but find her voice to be somewhat grating and her lyrics a bit inane.
0375869026|4.0|This book was assigned to my incoming 5th grader and she abolutley loved it. There is a real message and life lesson to be learned about how to treat those who are &#34;different.&#34;

B008ZCWFEE|5.0|My 9 yo DD has claimed to dislike math for YEARS.  Turns out what she doesn't enjoy is boring workbook arithmetic.  She caught onto this game very quickly and finished it in a day.  Thanks to this clever app, she's motivated to master arithmetic so she can move on to REAL math (algebra and beyond).  This has been one of the best educational purchases that we've made.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is a great app for kids - it really teaches reasoning and critical thinking.  It also teaches basic spelling as you have to write the words out.  I have to write them for my son (who can't write yet), but it is helping us working on letter recognition and he's good at figuring out what is needed after I read the clue.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book out of curisity - I always want to check why the fuzz about a book. I was totally out of my taste. I couldn't finish it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Characters are very well developed. plot is very elaborate and well put together. Start here if you're going to read the series.
B005LAII4E|4.0|I say \\"kind of\\" because this movie more acknowledges the first movie than it does follow it.  It kept the main ending plot point of Zartan taking over the presidency from the first film, and expanded on the Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow story a bit, but aside from that almost everything was different.  Most of the main cast from the first movie were not brought back.  That is not such a bad thing in the case of Marlon Wayans, but it is when talking about Sienna Miller, Rachel Nichols, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Christopher Eccleston.  Although they did leave open the possibility of bringing Destro back in what will inevitably be another movie in the franchise.<br /><br />The highlight of the film (as it was in the first one) were the martial arts sequences involving Ray Park and Byung Hun Lee.  Sometimes they were fighting each other, sometimes together, and sometimes on their own.  Wire work and special effects aside, they steal the show every time.  The mountain top ninja fight about halfway through the movie is worth the price.  The additions of Adrianne Palicki and D.J. Cotrona as Lady Jaye and Flint were fine, The Rock was pretty much his standard action hero persona, and Ray Stevenson as the other main bad guy Firefly was also very good.  Channing Tatum and Bruce Willis had what amounted to expanded cameo roles but were not around for long.<br /><br />You pretty much know what you get going into a movie like this.  A lot of action, shoot-em-up explosions and martial arts.  The movie looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray.  The special features are pretty standard, but nothing to write home about.  Chances are if you like the first one you will like this one.  Unless of course you are one who absolutely hate the idea of the cast turn over and abandoning much of the story from the first movie.  If you hate that idea or are just not a fan of the genre in general, then skip this.  Otherwise, it is worth a couple hours of your time if you are in the mood to watch an action movie.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Working my way through the second book in the series and really enjoying it.  A long read but very engrossing.  Definitely read book one in the series before reading this one.<br /><br />Characters are very well developed. plot is very elaborate and well put together.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I don't understand the bad reviews. Story was great, characters, great, and John's alpha male sense of humor was a gift that kept giving.  Looking forward to the next installment of this series.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is much like Team Fortress! Great characters, good mix of classes, fun weapons, taunts!, and golden guns to boot! Dagnab if I ain't jus excited as a coon in a toad pond! I am gonna go cap some fools right now! Funk yeah!
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|Was not what I was expecting from the previews. The movie did remind me a little of a Quentin Tarantino type movie. I don't normally like Nick Cage, but this role I did like him in.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and exciting to play. The game is totally worth buying. I love this game .Sweetness is the taste of victory
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Game is addicting but hoping they would come out with an upgrade being I have over $60million to spend on upgrades!
B002SQNM9A|5.0|Great take on the old X-MAS CLASSICS! Only Taylor could give it a new life to something that well known. Loved it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the game, great way to kill time when bored. My 3 year old likes it as well, so it's great for all ages.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|I have been a fan of &#34;FLOYD&#34; since i was 11. Never have they been dethroned. they are unique and yes ASTRONOMICAL.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the hale but some times there are games that you cant win but other than that the game is sol much gun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun app to play to pass the time.  Family enjoy it as well.  The upgrade give you a new challenge every so often.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Yes, it's a novel, but based on interviews with escapees from North Korea and other sources.  Can any place really be this isolated and controlled in this day and age?
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This game is probably one of the best dress-up games ever. The only thing I didn't like about it was how you have to pay to get most of the make-up, hair -dos, and dresses and everything else.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|This book is written with Much Research in Numerous Fields in order to support the idea of no god. It is very clear and easy to read. He has a great sense of humor also.<br /><br />Believers should not be afraid to read it. You can keep your views if you wish after reading, but understand there are other ways to view the universe.<br /><br />This book helped me as an atheist because it confirmed many of my ideas and thoughts. I feel less alone now. Also, learned that atheists are the 3rd largest group. [...]<br /><br />Though I often find it pointless to explain my view to believers, I thank Richard Dawkins for helping me word myself better.
0767803434|5.0|one of Ford's best lines ever...&#34;get off of my plane&#34;....kind of sums it up.  Oldham really makes u hate him.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is very fun, a little repetitive but I think the makes are making improvements on it. However,Amazon needs to have the updates come to the store faster. Other Android platforms get updates 2 to 3weeks before Amazon. That needs to change.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great fun very simple yet still enjoyable  for people of all ages. my kids love it and so do i
B0007KVAVG|5.0|Great music. Judas Priest is still kicking it out. The band is still dishing out top quality metal tunes. A true and consistent metal band.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great for attention and agility...perfect brain food.<br />Children should enroll more and practice everyday to beat the last score.<br />Nice idea
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game for adults and kids!! Very addicting!! Can take up a lot of free time, but well worth it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like it if my internet was faster it would probably work better but I use it when their is a storm
B001B51B9M|5.0|Blu Ray has really restored this movie. Fun to watch. Nice to see the old movies come out as they were intended to be seen.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like this android better than others because it has some features the other does not have such as the
B00B49GSOS|3.0|Takes up where Lord of the Rings end. A bit disappointing.<br />Put this & that from the series and you have Hobbit
B004KPX4W2|5.0|I enjoy all of Bruce Willis' work. He shined once again in &#34;Red&#34;. Good story. Start was a little slow but action packed thrills and laughs come fast and furious.<br /><br />This one proves that old is not dead. It was great.<br />I am glad that &#34;Hollywood&#34; is using age appropriate actors for parts instead of going for those much younger and making them look old.
074401493X|4.0|I wanted a strategy guide for the game since this was the first video game in a while I wanted to play again and do everything in it. The hard cover is very nice, the details are done well, and the firefly keychain is pretty cool as well. i'd definitly recommend this to a friend who wants a cool collectors piece for the game and wants a way to find everything in it.
B001BQDP90|1.0|I am so disappointed in this seller's item. When it arrived i was so excited to view the movie due to it being the specialty unrated international version. 5 chapters of the movie were completely ruined and scratch and it began as soon as the plot thickened so i was completely lost. I view this item i purchased as completely ruined and
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|The game was absolutely amazing and the music always set the mood of each seen in a subtle way. Now I can listen to the music in my car. Love it.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Peter Dinklage! He does such fine job w/ Tyrion Lannister, I forget how cunning he is. I'm finally accustomed to Lena Heady (Cersei) having blond hair. I also think the actress playing Daenerys Stormborn (Emilia Clarke) has become more believable in the role. I'm still not happy with the actor in Jon Snow's role- maybe Season 3?<br />The Blackwater battle was well done but I missed Tyrion's chain. After all, it made the firing of the fleet successful. I'm looking forward to the dragons getting bigger and seeing what comes next. Even though I've read the books, I think the series is good enough to stand on its own.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely live this game!! I'm addicted, one of the best games I've ever played. Start playing!! Minions will make your day.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I really appreciated that the actors were not *STARS*. I would have found that a distraction.<br />The first season has been a bit uneven but I found the first book a bit uneven. The writing has gotten better and the actors are wonderful in their roles. The only thing I wish they'd done differently was to have even younger looking actors for the teenaged and younger roles. Something that really struck me in the boks was how young these characters were.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD.  And just like all 5FDP CD's I love every song off every cd.  That is amazing,  and I never get tired of listening to them. One or the other is always in my CD player or I choose from my mp players.  They are an amazing band in so many ways.  I love Ivan's vocals.  He is a true vocal talent.. Anyone who has never listened I recommend this cd and all 5FDP CDs.  You will fall in love with their music.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The writing for this show is excellent. Julianna Margulies, Christine Baranski, Archie Panjabi, Martha Plimpton! Where else can you see strong women (who are not in their 20's) kick ass?
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Love the album, so glad their back together, sounds so much like their original stuff.  Plus it comes with the bonus disc.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|Jane Austen's writting is and always will be brilliant! The language she uses is beyond amazing, and can never be copied by any modern writer. One downside is the slight confusion in the language, which is bitter sweet. But if you take time to really delve deep into the story, you will not be disappointed!
0143119680|5.0|This is a book I could not turn down until I read the last page. Its fantastic and you will want to read more. Its a trilogy so it should be getting better and better I suppose. But the first parts leaves you breathless. What a read!
B009I2UH2W|2.0|It charged quick so I was happy about it, probably 2-3 mo. later it kept saying that it's not for this device or something like that, so I was given a new one. And this one lasted like a couple weeks, maybe it was a month, and this one just didn't charge my phone at all. It lit up and everything but did not charge my phone so now I just use a regular USB and charge my phone to my radio which can get pretty annoying since it constantly wants to switch over to USB
B0061S0A64|5.0|Wow! Very fun and easy to use. Great sounds and options. Well worth getting! It sounds like an old video game soundtrack.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|I am Legend(released Dec/07)stars,among others,Will Smith,Alice Braga and Charlie Tahan.This is a film that should have been better than it was,but it's slow pace and erratic plot coupled with computer generated zombies that look TOO phony,all work against it.<br />The story finds Smith as a doctor who lives a solitary existence in New York City,along with his German shepard,Sam.Through back story telling we find he had a wife and a daughter.He was one of a team that were responsible for developing a cancer cure.Much of the human population was inoculated,only for most to come down with a deadly virus that killed them.The others that weren't killed turned into light sensitive zombies,who came out at nightfall.Smith has been continuing to work on a cure in his basement lab,but with no success.His daily routine is monotonous,as his search pattern spreads out little by little each day through the city streets.He also makes his usual rounds to pick up necessities at various spots.<br />One day comes which changes everything.His dog runs into a darkened building in which he has to enter to get him.With zombies inside waiting for the dark,he barely manages to escape with Sam alive.He captures one and takes it back to his lab for testing.The next day he discovers a dummy from a store he frequents,sitting down at the dead end of an entirely different street.It is a trap,and before he is able to respond he is suspended above the street by a trip wire.The sun is going down and he finally manages to get loose and fall to the ground,but accidentally impales himself on his knife.Before he can reach his car he and Sam are attacked by zombie dogs which bite Sam.<br />Back at Smith's home and lab Smith injects Sam with a relaxant,but Sam soon turns.Smith is forced to kill his companion in his arms.Wanting revenge Smith deliberately heads out in the dark and confronts the zombies at a pier.He manages to take down a few,but he is soon overpowered.He is upside down and helpless in his car when a bright light illuminates the area.He is rescued by another survivor with a child.They return to Smith's place.The new survivor wants Smith to come with her to a place she has heard is not infected,but he remains adamant to stay and find a cure.Checking his captured zombie he finds he has finally found the cure,as the zombie's symptoms are slowly disappearing.That night the zombies come a calling right to Smith's house and they storm it.Smith and company are forced into a sealed glass area at one end of the basement,but the head zombie deliberately,and with a purpose Smith had heretofore denied,continually slams against the glass,trying to break it.Smith sends his two new friends out through an escape tunnel,while he stays to deal with what lies ahead.<br />The zombies finally break the glass and just as they enter,Smith lets go with a grenade which completely destroys everything.The film ends as his two new companions finally make their way to the safe haven that was mentioned earlier.The vaccine Smith created was given to her and she hands it over to the heads of the population within the walled city.<br />One point that bothers me about the film is that Smith never acknowledges or seems to realize at any time,that the zombies are actually more than air heads.He never cottons on to the fact that the zombies could think,let alone seek revenge as they started to do when they trapped him by enticing him with a dummy he encounters everyday.He never asks who moved it or why.It never seems to occur to him the reason the zombie behaviour changed so drastically was because of his capture of the mate to the leader of a group of them.For a supposedly smart guy,he was pretty dumb.That said,Smith does have some good acting moments,especially his killing of his beloved Sam.It just wasn't enough however to elevate this film to anything than average,at best.The CGI zombies just look too phony.I think the film makers spent most of their budget on their star and had toresort to CGI instead of prosthetic make up.The whole feel of the film would have been far superior had the zombies been real people,ala Resident Evil.Emma Thompson has an all too brief cameo as a doctor being interviewed on a TV screen at the beginning.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Since the film is descended from the comics,there are four animated comics included with the DVD.<br />All in all the film is a slow moving one,with CGI zombies that look so phony,one cannot suspend their disbelief for any more than two seconds.Smith tries his best,but what should have been a home run,turned into a walk to first base.resort to CGI instead of prosthetic make up.The whole

B0064X7FVE|4.0|Simple &amp; Intuitive, but loaded with ads...  I guess if you don't mind being sold to while you check weather, it's ok.
0399226907|5.0|This was an awsome book! My kids love it. My 4 yr olds face lights up when i go to read it to him!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|another great album by Queens, does not disappoint. Was everything that I hoped it would be and more. highly recommend
193700788X|1.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already. This is a truly awful ending to our beloved characters. When someone asks me which do I prefer, tv show or the books? I always answer that I love them both.  They are so different from each other that it isn't that hard for me to think of them as not being the same characters. But after this final book my answer had changed.  I mean....really.  The person she ends up with.....seriously?
B001XVD21Y|4.0|Hell, even Damon really steps it up here (never been a huge fan). There's really not much more that needs to be said.... Oh, and its about gangsters. I mean how many bad gangster movies are there, really?!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This is a fun and incredibly entertaining book. It reads like a James Bond movie but is smarter because it's set in a historical time period and filled with smart details. If you like Miss Moneypenny, M, Blofeld, et al then this is the book for you. No dull moments, lots of laughs, beautiful women and more action than most summer movies. I loved every word. I'm off now to check out this writer's other books.
B00BESCJII|5.0|The story opens in your typical teenage life discovery journey fashion. Awkward kid just starting out high school and is quite lonely. The story is narrated though by the character through the recital of letters addressed to 'Friend'. This sets up the darker undertone to the story that just barely breaks the surface until the finale where it comes bubbling over in directorial and storytelling genius. Superbly acted and directed by all, in a day and age where buying movies is a rarity, this may be the next addition to my modest blu-ray collection.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I've always been a big fan of puzzle games and this one has so many different puzzles it kept me busy for hrs. I would recommend this game 2 anyone who is a puzzle lover.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|I thought this one was way better than Revenge of the Fallen which was utter GARBAGE. I thought the final battle at the end was really weak though, Optimus takes down everyone and they offer no resistance.The first Transformers movie is still the best one.
B00CEF014E|5.0|If you like mysteries, psychological thrillers, cruel ancient rituals, and lots of unexpected plot turns, this book is for you. You can't go wrong with this novella. Just don't read too many reviews: they reveal too much of the plot and can spoil the experience for you.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about this book. The plot will keep you guessing all the way. Just as you think you have figured something out, the story takes a different turn. The characters are realistic and believable. The main character, Dana, comes across as both vulnerable and determined - and that's appealing. At the beginning of the story, she is struggling to overcome some serious issues in her life, but the methods she is using to solve her issues are not working. What ultimately helps her solve those initial problems is very unexpected, yet logical.<br /><br />The language of the book is so vivid that the book feels like a movie is playing in front of you. The author puts just the right amount of sensory details to immerse the readers into the settings: the sounds, the sights, the smells - it's all there. But you will never feel overwhelmed with details or flowery descriptions. All the details serve a purpose, and all of them pull you more and more into the story.<br /><br />I love that this story can be read on so many different levels: you can read it as an exciting thriller and mystery and enjoy it just as that. But you can also think about larger issues that the book brings up, from utopian societies to ineffectiveness of anti-depressants. I highly recommend it!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I just watched it on Amazon and I have to say it wasn't that good. This movie had no real sense of danger like the Joker brought to the previous movie. The bomb plot was really generic. Bane was not very dangerous or intimidating and his plans fell through way to easily, and sometimes I couldn't understand what he was saying. The ending was not satisfying all. The villains were defeated too easily. I was not on the edge of my seat like with the previous movie. Not Terrible but I expected a better movie 3/5 score.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I don't do a lot of games, but this one hooked me. Lots of different puzzles to solve...nothing to extreme , but enough to keep interest.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is very amazing! I love all the graphics and everything! I REALLY suggest you get this game right now!
B00BX8PG4S|4.0|a good movie with a good story line .  not one of the great movies  but definitely one worth watching
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My children like this app because it features lots of different sea creatures and cool graphics. They would recommend this game to 4-7-year-olds.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|At the heart of Old Man's War is a set of characters you can really care about, in a set of circumstances that are just beyond our own reach. The story sucks you in so well that I stayed up till 3am to finish it - Just didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />This is the 3rd story I have read by John Scalzi - and I am still amazed at the range of emotions he pulls from my heart. Many story points struck me as directly related to my own life. How DOES he do that - over and over again?<br /><br />Like the other two stories I read before this, I went up and down from laughter to literal tears and back again till its satisfying end. And my first response on finishing was to look for other stories in the series.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I found it quite slow to start with, but as it went on it got not too bad, I will definitely buy the next one  hoping that the action is ramped up a bit.Following the Lord of the rings it has a lot to live up to.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Definitely a win for the 007 legacy.  Wit, style and action flesh out the narrative which itself is well conceived and delivered with classic 007 panache.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game. Its challenging but not too hard to be frustrating.  I can't wait for more levels.

B0033B5XCS|5.0|I love this DVD collection mainly because the DVDs actually stay in the holders! Very well too! The movies also look and sound great. This is the best Nightmare On Elm Street DVD collection available and for a pretty affordable price!
B009K916ZK|1.0|I bought one and it worked for two days before it stopped showing feed from my macbook pro....<br />be careful when buying and especially if its not from apple store...<br />many replicas out there...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. The control scheme is different from Temple Run but works better in the game's levels because there's more obstacles to dodge. What makes this game better than Temple Run is that it gives you more goals, thus you're not playing without reason. Temple Run was enjoyable, but once you run out of things to collect and characters to unlock, what then?
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I like playing the Nevosoft games and this one has not disappointed me. It lives up to the same standard as the other ones I have played. Thanks for an interesting game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The Best season yet! Definitely leaves you wanting more. Can't wait to see what's in store next season for Downton.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Action packed with some comedy from beginning to the end it kept you on the edge of your seat highly recommend
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|cant seem to get enough of this game! I downloaded it for my kid but she's not nearly as interested in it as I am!!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|very good if u don't have anything to do plus it is very addictive and its pretty fun to play :-)
1781164266|5.0|Being a huge fan of the design of the game series, this was a no brainer. the art is simply breathtaking. A must have and great inspiration for any artist.
B0051O8Z66|5.0|unexpected quality, love it, great songs, great style, music that wants to make you move...The Flood, and Love, Love are highlights of this collection
161655164X|5.0|this book blew me away. incredibly inspiring to see the designs from initial concept to final. definitely pick this one up
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|This is a sublime CD, it has a vintage feel, but is still modern, her voice is better than ever, it my summer soundtrack, these tracks are not overdone, her voice is beautiful, the songs are beautiful, and Agnetha is beautiful
B009PNQUXO|1.0|Downloaded the files but the files were unreadable by my Kindle Fire HD. Absolutely pointless pointless me. The UK is pretty bad too
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Great packaging and convenient way to keep all the DVD's organized by season.  Aaron Sorkin remains as once of the most talented writers in the television business.  Great alternative to what passes for television programming these days.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|another great app by LiBii...great company..great colors, fabulous app. very entertaining for little girls. I have suggested these apps by this company to many friends for their children or grandchildren
B00B1RB942|5.0|Even though this movie is probably intended for a more adult audience, my three under age 10 kids all love watching it. The colors are amazing, the story line is engaging, and the characters are believable. In an age where there are 1.2 billion Facebook users, it's not hard to imagine an immersive online world where people have invested all of their personal and public information. One of my favorite anime movies so far...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really love the trilogy of the hunger game. It was great I love the story the characters and specifically the situation s and decisions that they had to do very moving.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series and have become quite absorbed with everyone's lives. Watching this helps me through the gray winters
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The main characters are unique because they mastermind a prisoners sting against the legal system.  Very entertaining, keeps you on your toes! Even though the story is not based on anything real, John Grisham makes it believable! Great book!
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|Very cute pieces. Some jewels have fallen off the wall and pieces curl on edges so you have flatten out. Great for the price though.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have sent people message and I can see they r online and they don't get the message so plz fix it
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book took me through a rollover coaster of emotions with the characters. The writing is amazing. I would recommend this book to everyone, and I already have. You have to read the book before watching the movie which is almost as good. You couldn't go wrong with this book!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The books are filled with intrigue yet are not as hard a read as The Lord of the Ring Series.  I am 1/2 way through the third book and enjoying it immensely.  Had not watched the series but am now starting to watch from the beginning &#34;on demand&#34;.  Love it.
B005CVWWJY|4.0|Can you recite all of Monty Python & the Holy Grail? Have you still got some D&d modules at the back of a closet? Do you sing along to Ana Ng at the top of your voice? Then this is the book for you. It certainly was for me.<br /><br />I really loved the treasure hunt structure of this book, and the pace was great.<br /><br />My only two niggles would be that a.the characters stay a little flat and b. the writing style, particularly early on, feels more aimed at teenagers than adults. It quickly picks up though, as the author gets in his stride.<br /><br />Oh, and I felt like the Og character's action in the end was too much Deus Ex Machina.<br /><br />But they are only niggles in a very enjoyable pop culture romp.
1449305172|5.0|I read Eric Ries' The Lean Startup and found the subject matter interesting & compelling.  Unfortunately, it was difficult for me to translate the abstract learning in The Lean Startup into practical, actionable steps.  This is what Ash has managed to do so splendidly with Running Lean.  And this is what make the books so valuable.  Ash is personally invested and dedicated in helping entrepreneurs to succeed (in developing a successful business model before scarce resources are depleted), and he has provided a host of online resources & offline tools to assist you, including actual scripts which can be used for conducting interviews and experiments.<br /><br />For the startup entrepreneur, forget going to Harvard Business School (FYI, I am an MBA graduate of HBS), purchase this book and apply the concepts religiously.  Had I done so, I know I would have saved myself much time, money and the attendant dead brain cells.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|This was a fun take on this classic story. A bit predictable, but enjoyable nonetheless. The kids will enjoy it as well.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|I love seeing the many different areas and species of the world we inhabit. This video series is a fascinating look at places and things many of us will never have the opportunity to see in person. It's enjoyable as well as educational.
0671646788|5.0|This book puts you on the right path to wealth and happiness.  It is very motivational.  I highly recommend it.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Bought this based on my son's recommendation. Unique style that has grown on me the more I listen. Each time I listen I find a new favorite song on the CD, which is my definition of a great CD. Plus, the guy has a great sense of humor - rare in the commercial music world. Great summertime listen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is kind of like subway surfurs but with your cute funny crazy minions it is addicting and fun you should get it
B0028IDXDS|5.0|At first our 1 month old didn't really like this but it comes in handy when she's still looking for something to put in her mouth after feedings.  This little gizmo will help put her right to sleep!  It also stays put so she can get it back in her mouth even when swaddled up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked this app and sad when I finished. Would love more levels. It made me think, but it was too hard to solve.
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|Oder was great, fast turn around. Will order again. Will be talking to you all again soon. Thank you very much
0007466064|5.0|A truly excellent saga.  Probably my favorite of all time.  Great characters, once I got them straightened out in my head, there are so many!
B007704HO6|5.0|I order this book and was so very very happy when it cam a few days later. Will order with you all again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show seems to keep getting better. How many different ways can you kill you a zombie? I'm ready to find out.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I am not a fan of the thriller genre, but the premise of this book was too much to resist. A brain-injured heroine who may be in danger? Sign me up!<br /><br />The author did an excellent job of immersing the reader in the protagonist's mounting terror. I will confess to having read the story in a single afternoon--I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The cast of characters was painted lovingly, and limited to a reasonable number, which helped ratchet up the tension. Neither the reader's energy--nor the plot's momentum--was dispersed by following a group of twenty best friends who wandered on and off the pages.<br /><br />My primary complaint is that the sense of constant confusion became cloying after a time. I understand that the protagonist had certain inescapable shortcomings. I just needed to find some portion of her narrative reliable, and I found it both unbelievable and cloying when I found that I was unable to do so.<br /><br />The protagonist was damaged, yes; but most adult humans need to create some sense of stability. I could not understand why she did not. I also struggled to accept her internal sense of logic regarding whom she could trust.<br /><br />Finally, I felt that the ending was a bit too tidy/contained. I wanted to see a more realistic response to the traumas and abuse that the heroine had suffered.<br /><br />Overall, this was a highly enjoyable tale. Kudos to S. J. Watson.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|I just finished watching Upside down and thought it was a cute, entertaining movie with some great visuals. I did not regret spending my money to watch it, but I did regret not renting the HD version.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun for kids and adults. I love it and my two kids are both addicted to it. Plus the Minions are so cute.
B005F9TQ2Y|4.0|As with other recordings in Bob Dylan's personal time-life series of spiritual journeying, the music is a 5 Star experience. How could I not give 5 Stars to any recording by Dylan which utilized the Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare rasta rhythmistas? The singing is still Bob, and the back-up vocalists are 5 Stars, once again. The songs are only a bit less confrontational than on Slow Train Coming, Saved, and Shot of Love. The overt spiritual patina of the lyrics is a bit more muted, but that may just be a matter of opinion.<br /><br />Even if you are a Bob-L Head, this may not be in your playlist. On the other hand, I took several songs from Infidels, Saved, and Shot of Love (all AutoRipped) and created a playlist entitled the Revelation of St. Bob. If you cannot imagine doing something similar, then I would highly recommend that you save yourself the aggravation and by-pass this title. Just for context: I \\"hate\\" New Morning and Self-Portrait, but I still sing (usually off-key, nasally, and warbly) snippets of some of the songs from these two offerings. \\"If dogs run free, then why not me?\\"
B00CFO7PK2|5.0|unbelievable voice, complex rhythmic interections between piano and voice. Diverse range of songs from romantic to exciting, something for everyone!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am addicted to the minions!!! and I love that they just upgraded for despicable me 2! def a must!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is exciting and a interesting period piece. Love how simple of time it was yet shows how history began changing- such as women voting-telephones... Strength of family!
B00156ZWV0|5.0|To have the ability to choose any of Vaughan Williams works and at a bargain price, is worthy of the 5 star rating. It will, of course, take time to listen to them all but this only adds to the value .
B002NUULNG|5.0|I was unsure about the visual update (cgi) but once I watched it and then the original, it only made it better. well worth it. for green anime watchers, this is a must
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|A bit to dark at times, making it difficult to see a hidden object or space. Otherwise a great game, worth watching what they do in the future...
B00B7HQ1DA|4.0|I really like Boz Scaggs new Album/CD/Music Download, Memphis.  Many good mellow rock songs and R & B tunes. Keep on recording Boz!
0810989956|4.0|this book is the only one what was needed to complete the set of books in the diary of a wimpy kid
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I got this app cause my friends said it was really cool. I didn't think they till I started playing it this is the best! It is really fun ,but they could lower the price on extra things like gems and plants.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I really liked this story. The characters are well developed as is their various stories. I love the science fiction world building even though it's hard to imagine a giant crab/snail creature as being very scary. Can't wait for the next book!
B000WEMH3C|5.0|Good quality and just what I expected. I was very happy that it fit my Weber Grill that I ordered it for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is s great game.  I just wish that you could get the extra costume were s little easier to get.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Rich characters, plot twists, suspense, and so much more.  Loved it!  Loved it!  What an amazing book.  I wish it didn't have to end.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This is a easy read and a storyline that keeps you involved.<br />I would recommend to people that love a good war book
1451695195|5.0|A well written book by someone that was there, and would like to express his belief in the hear after.It is a easy book to read.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Honestly I like this album better than I thought I would. Previewing short, few-second clips on Amazon isn't the same as listening to the songs all the way through and really feeling the music. The album is more simple, more acoustic, more adult contemporary. I love it more every time I listen to it. I give it 5/5.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Rock fans rejoice!!!!!!!!! Best straight up rock album I've heard in years!!  Will be on the play list for quite a while to come!! While the musicianship is incredible, each player pays homage to the song first, leaving no doubt that these three incredible players know how to make a \\"Band\\" work!!  Only gave it five stars because there was no option for six!!!
0515123447|5.0|I can't wait to read the rest of Lee Childs books.  (By the way, Tom Cruise is NO Jack Reacher.)
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I absolutely loved this third book in the series.  A wonderful romance read with great suspense. I cannot wait until book 4.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Received Season I as a gift and got hooked and can't wait for Season 6.  Great characters and great show!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I was looking for a new book to read and a friend of mine told me to go read The Name of the Wind. I had already read it a few years ago and I told them the only problem I had with it was that they had not made a 2nd book yet, oh boy was I wrong! they prompted me to look up the 2nd book and I was very pleased with it :)
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great book about a true American hero. If you like action, valor, charactor - you'll find it here. Good read!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Very fun game which gets pretty challenging towards the end. Just wish it had more levels, I felt like I finished it too quickly
B00CMQX84A|5.0|It is High School Musical meets Grease, meets a 1960's beach movie<br />Ros Lynch is amazing,funny,great actor,great singer five stars
B009NY43NY|5.0|Enjoyed it more than the Trueblood series on HBO.  The characters in the book are a lot more interesting and fun!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|It was a well done job great for kids and adults just like the old cartoons and so on on on
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I only finished it on principle. What a terrible book. I'm ashamed that so many women find it sexy and erotic. It's not even he sex scenes that bother me... I'm very open about things like that, but these characters seem like awful, sad, selfish and stupid people. Won't be reading the other two. I wish for character's sake that the story would have stopped here.
B0090SI44M|5.0|Upon arrival of our movie, my 5 and 4 year old were glued to the tv and have watched it several times since. Great movie. Condition of material was great, no scratches, no problems with viewing the movie itself...great service, great product. Thank you.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I replaced my regular clock with this app. Easy to use and portable too. Plus It charges over night on my stand.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is part of the &quot;guess the&quot; series of games.  They are all fun enough to play so why not give them a shot?  They're free!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|First, let me say this is not Neil Gaiman's best work, American Gods is arguably his best, though this is not a bad book by any means. It is a very quick and easy read, and it is filled with dark mystery and wonder that Gaiman does so well. The book will leave an impression if you let it. I finished the tale musing over childhood remembrances and what they would look like had I experienced them now. I was also left at the end of the tale pondering the mysteries of or universe and the possibility of unknown and unexplored areas in creation. I feel that Gaiman intended this for the novel that is that the reader examine themselves and their world rather than let the young boy of the story do all the work. It is not a book everyone will enjoy, but I think it is a book that everyone should experience.
B00BM6BR8A|4.0|Kadavar's second album, Abra Kadavar, is a hard driving, riff-tastic masterpiece that goes beyond their often-credited influences. You get: guitar, vocals, bass and drums with few overdubs. The songs have a darkness to them that is somewhat psychedelic or occult-ish, but always interesting.  This record gets put on at parties and converts people to the church of Kadavar right away. They have done an excellent job creating a image that fits their sound. One look at that cover and you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />They Vinyl is 180 gram. Mine is purple, but they pressed several colors. The gatefold sleeve is beautifully printed and on heavy stock. No MP3 card is included (bastards!).  Highly recommended!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It is great at what it does, but it seems to be limited at the moment. Once more apps start allowing the cast feature this will be amazing! Netflix from my phone (with phone as remote) and easy to take anywhere makes this one of my favorite gadgets by far!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good game. Fun to play. Only complaint is that the regen time is a little long and the prizes are a little repetitive. But otherwise a good fun game
B003EV6DBM|5.0|It is hard to believe the writers can keep coming up with such great scripts.  Didn't know if I was going to like this doctor and first, but he is great and I like his companions too - especially Rory.
0679805273|5.0|This is a wonderful book to give to graduates and new workers.  I teach and always give this to my student teachers.
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|I love all the Doctor Who films (well, not the original series - I tried the first couple and couldn't watch it - really corny).
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I heard so many positive things about this movie and decided to give it a try. My boyfriend and I watched it and we couldn't stop laughing. The entire movie is really just a riot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a must have game! I loved Despicable Me the movie one and two and the game is just both movies in game mode. First off you have Gru's Lab, then you unlock Residential area (neighborhood), then you can unlock El Macho's Lair with Despicable score of x6.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I definitely enjoyed  Mumford & Sons prior to Babel, but now I enjoy them even more. There isn't a song that I skip on their CD - definitely perfect for a long drive somewhere.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I'm able to get the cut scene but it will be in the loading scene and then wont load so i cant play it. I wish i could play it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I had to buy a new router before the streaming media player started to work. Too slow.  Not Google's fault.  The product itself and the documentation are as good as it gets.  I already  had Roku which can deliver more media choices, but the Google Chromecast concept of streaming whatever you have on your Chrome home page is simpler and will soon have more media.  I miss the possibility of Amazon streaming, but if I want it bad enough, I use Roku.<br /><br />Easy as pie to install and works exactly as advertised.  You won't get the free NetFlix promotion because \\"He who hesitates pays more\\", but I, as an earliest adopter, payed a net of less than $10 for this useful and cute gadget.
B009C7JS14|5.0|This app works fine for me because it is updated when I wake up with the current weather. I don't use it that much but so far I have no complaints.
B00CW665VI|5.0|\\"Edward Cullen can take his stupid heroine and OD on it. Kate is my own personal brand of Viagra\\"<br /><br />This book was full of witty and funny quotes. Then reading the story from just Drew point of view was a great change. This book was pretty awesome and Chapter 13 was pretty freaking HOT....
B00AYB16EO|1.0|I stopped watching at 40 minutes. I just couldn't take it anymore. Funny? No way! Farts are funny to a point,they overkilled it with them. The bad language also an over kill and so was the sex humor. The deputy doofy was really stupid! No need to watch the sequels. If you like the \\"Pull my finger\\" humor then it'll be funny to you.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|Lots of fun once I caught on.  Wish there were more instructions on how to play and what all the different things are for and best time to use them.  I'm new at this Kindle so I'm sure its just me.  However, I really like the game and the gofer is so cute.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it is very very very very VERY AWSOME be cc house it's like temple run but better!!!($

140006922X|5.0|Aslan explores almost a thousand references on the life and times in which Jesus was born as well as books on the historical life of Jesus. His central observation regards the historical import of the crucifixion - that it was reserved for the most dangerous POLITICAL opponents of the Roman Empire.  Historians have often advanced the argument that the persecution of Jesus was largely politically motivated in the past, but Aslan adds a tremendous level of scholarship and weight to the argument.<br /><br />It is a must read for all those interested in the historical Jesus.  It is amusing to see the very large number of one star reviews, 40% of which come from the same geographic node on the internet; most of which were put there within hours of each other when a prominent Evangelical preacher condemned the very idea of a Muslim writing about Jesus.  That is, I would be amused except there are those who take this very obvious hate campaign to reflect the views of actual readers.  Perhaps Amazon needs to build a filter for their reviews to filter out the hate-filled spam campaigns that seem to accompany the publication of any religious work which is not wholly informed by fundamentalist, evangelical superstition and myth.
B00B93UDK4|1.0|What is this made of? Platinum? If the stated price is actually correct, is this a charity item for the family, or? Otherwise, this ripoff is an insult to JC and his fans of the lowest order.
0062255657|5.0|Gaiman is a master storyteller. in my mind he has created a universe in which each story is woven from threads of the others. There is familiarity in entirely new contexts. He builds suspense, and always studies compassion and wonder. I look forward to his work.
B000ME5B30|5.0|Everyone should watch this documentary. I would highly recommend this to everyone. Very well researched. I would highly recommend it.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|good game for older folks. it really works the old brain cells. I am already thru the 3rd chapter and I just downwarded the app.
B000FBJHT4|5.0|This is a very well written book, obviously from an expert. Even if you are a novice in this subject you can understand it. I would recommend it to anyone interested in this subject.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I thought this was a good movie. To me, it makes me think of how people blindly follow orders to do certain jobs and when they question things, they realize what they thought were true, isn't.
034580404X|4.0|This was a very well written book about a subject matter we can all identify with (love) in a background that most of us are not familiar with or can identify with so it was an interesting combination that kept you reading. Would recommend to adults.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Great Game. The only downside to this game much like others, is the wait time. Sometimes the wait time sucks so bad that I quit playing for days, because it gets so boring. I get stuck on a goal and I have to wait for a day to create enough lumber just to do it. Love the concept of medieval times, creating a virtual town, as well as missions, and to top it off a story line. I understand you want people to buy gems, but in reality I just want to uninstall it.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I originally wasn't going to watch this series as I am more of a 'vampire' fan than a 'zombie' fan but my niece had me watch a couple of series with her a couple of times and I was hooked!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really loved the books!!  It was interesting and kept my attention.  The only thing I wished is that the writer would tell more of Christian side of things.

B00CEF014E|5.0|Solstice is a short dark tale based on 'The Wicker Man' and deals with the trusting nature of defenseless individuals, especially the main character, Dana, who has been diagnosed as bipolar. Although there are sometimes a few things which suspend belief, this novella thriller reads very well and with a tweak or two could easily become a screenplay.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wonderful story about family, life and love.  Gives one a lot to think about with twists and turns and an uncommon ending.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This movie is definitely one of my all time favorite Disney movies. It's definitely a gem, a movie that can be enjoyed by both adults and children.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love this app.  Now I can shop ebay without having to turn on my computer!  Since I never go anywhere w/o my Kindle I always have access to ebay.
B0093QE37S|5.0|Katherine Hepburn is very amusing but its the contretemps between Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn that really steals the show.  Jimmy Stewart as the newspaper reporter assigned to the &#34;Wedding of the Year&#34; falls under the leading lady's spell is hysterical in the scene where Hepburn has too many cocktails. It's a tale of the extremely rich in a time when people were standing in bread lines.  This was escape for almost everyone then, and it is now.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|One of their best. My 10 year old grandson is listening and enoying the Beatles. It is so nice to share my memories with him
B00DQVSTCG|4.0|The MDNA tour is Madonna's ninth concert tour that spanned most of 2012 and was named the best-selling tour of 2012.  In terms of production, this show makes up for the weak Sticky & Sweet two year tour saga, but as a whole does not compare to some of Madonna's top tour moments.<br /><br />The show is broken out into specific sections with specific themes.  The first theme and the opening section of the show is extremely violent, detached, cold and raw.  Madonna defies gravity by dancing and moving to choreography that her younger predecessors wouldn't have ever been able to get through at the rehearsal stage.  Where this first section goes wrong for me is well, the music.  On paper it looks good but it doesn't translate into an energetic experience.<br />Girl Gone Wild, Revolver, Bang, Papa Don't Preach - (less than one minute), Hung Up - (auto-tuned, slowed down version that allows for Madonna to Slack-line throughout the track) and I Don't Give A -  Madonna comes to the end of her V-shaped catwalk and does her signature guitar (time for a break) part.<br />Though these are decent tracks on their own, as a whole, there are too many weak tracks in this first section that don't carry this section.  The choreography, on the other hand, is so intense and so precise that the music almost takes a back-seat.  If I were given an opportunity to direct a Madonna show where I could pick just about any track I wanted and directed it how I wanted, I would keep the music in mind as the TOP priority.  Here's my version of a set-list to go along with the theme and choreography of this first section:<br />Girl Gone Wild<br />Causing A Commotion (new 2013 version)<br />Bang<br />Papa Don't Preach (longer)<br />Rescue Me<br />Beautiful Killer<br /><br />The second section was a majorette theme and really should have been saved for the end of the show.  Here she does a funky rendition of Express Yourself and then goes into the Blaze remix of Give Me All Your Luvin' and then swiftly leaves the stage while the dancers finish out this quick, intense, hi-NRG section.  Pure perfection.<br /><br />The next section is more guitars, the basque trio supporting her with basque renditions of some classics she hasn't performed in years and more.<br />Turn Up the Radio - (surprised she turned this one into a guitar performance)<br />Open Your Heart - (basque version)<br />Masterpiece<br />I understand why she picked the tracks she did for this section.  Turn up was one of the stand outs from MDNA.  Open Your Heart is one of her biggest hits and a fan favorite and hasn't been performed since the Blond Ambition Tour. Masterpiece is the theme song of the film she directed, W.E.  I would have preferred a version of Open Your Heart that remained closer to the original.  This one was just a little too \\"Riverdance\\" and bouncy for me and not as sleek as the original.  Nonetheless I do like that she weaves these unique sounds into her productions and keeps things fresh.<br /><br />Once the basque section is complete, and after the sexy Justify My Love interlude come to an end, we go into the best version of Vogue that Madonna has done in years.  It takes us back to the days of \\"Blond Ambition\\" and Madonna gives us some serious attitude.  There's only one problem...one major problem...the best song of the night gets shortened and we lose the third verse and chorus?!?! WHY?  Just as an FYI, she kept the same treatment and length from the Super Bowl performance which was great for that short medley performance but should have been given a full treatment during the MDNA Tour.  She then goes into one of my favorite tracks from 2008's Hard Candy album, Candy Shop.  With that said, putting this song on the set-list was a glaring mistake and a song she should not have done on this tour.  If I were her, I would have gone right into \\"Get Together\\" from Confessions after Vogue to keep the energy going.  She then performs Human Nature almost identical to the version we were introduced to in 1994 and similar choreography to the video from 1995.  This truly was the best version of Human Nature she has ever choreographed for live performance.  This leads into a strip tease where she removes most of the clothes she started with in this section and the music also gets stripped to just a piano and her singing.  She sings Like A Virgin and Love Spent and does it beautifully backed with classical arrangements from the W.E. soundtrack.<br /><br />She goes into her standard political video interlude with Nobody Knows Me, a gem from the under-rated American Life album and then comes out on stage performing, I'm Addicted.  This track should have gotten a significantly better treatment than it did and really could have been a stand-out but it missed the mark.  The song ends with the letters \\"M\\" \\"D\\" \\"N\\" \\"A\\" being chanted over and over.  Im thinking epic performance possibility here.  She then goes into \\"I'm A Sinner/Cyberagga\\" and she may have fared better if she instead had gone into \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" or \\"Amazing\\" or one of the older more popular tracks that \\"Sinner\\" was modeled after.<br /><br />She goes into \\"Like A Prayer\\" which gets the entire house energized and reminds us of her legacy and the legend that she is and then closes the show with her not-so-popular compilation title track, \\"Celebration.\\"  I think she should have considered swapping the order, Celebration first then closing with Like A Prayer.  That would have made for a stronger close.<br /><br />Overall, this show is better than most shows you will see from any other artist.  The only artist that has put on a show better than this is, well....Madonna.  Watch the Confessions Tour, Reinvention Tour and the iconic, Blond Ambition tour to see some more examples of her genius.<br /><br />In terms of this blu-ray release, I was rather disappointed.  It is actually worse than the Epix tv airing of the show.  The sound quality is horrifying and there is a clear defect in the video quality.  The style of the shoot itself is also somewhat difficult to watch.  Madonna is over-exposed throughout the entire performance and after being at this show live, I am somewhat surprised at some of the angles chosen during some of the intricate choreography on this recording.  Finally, when will Madonna start adding the backing videos as extras? It is a pure travesty that those are left off as more often than not, those concert back-drops are better videos than some of her music video releases these days.roduced to in 1994 and similar choreography to the video from 1995.

B0097EWK3A|4.0|Fun to play. Graphics good. Only one complaint : you cannot use the map to warp between. locations. Getting around can be tiresome.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I got this app to try it and found it was really good.  I can tell at a glance how much power I have left on my Kindle Fire.  Try this app first, then go and buy the regular one.  It is worth it.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Very enjoyable read just like all her other books.  You just cant put her books down once you start reading.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|I've read through this book in one sitting. It's a captivating tale in which anything can happen (this is what I like most about Neil Gaiman's books).<br />Great reading for Gaiman's fans :-)
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|If you enjoy testing your mental skills and thinking outside the box,, this game is for you!  multilevel game play that changes with each new challenge.  Be careful....i<br />t will keep you playing for hours!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|It was fun watching the action heroes of my lifetime having fun making a shoot em up like this.  Lots of predictability, like bad aim with machine guns for all crooks and good aim, even with pistols, for all heroes, but the inside jokes and references to many of their individual movies was fun for someone who has seen most, if not all of them.<br /><br />This was a fun summertime diversion that I enjoyed very much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a very good game for young children and people who like games like temple run. I enjoy the game and so does my nephew.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|I had NO IDEA the author was a Muslim. I had no idea he also doesn't practice what he writes about. I want my money back. Reza Aslan go to confession and stay off Twitter !
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I started watching the first season on Prime and I'm hooked!  I've been watching non-stop and I am almost through season 4!  The show has great humor, a little romance, and a lot of science - although a bit far fetched.  The characters are good and do not fail to entertain.  It's If you have a sense of humour and  a good imagination, you will enjoy this!
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|It is timeless and awe-inspiring. Once you've fallen in love with this movie, you will carry it with you the rest of your life.
B000C13Y2S|1.0|bought to use as a mechanic. tripod legs not as shown in picture. cheap plastic that breaks as soon as you get it.
B009AMALGM|5.0|This was a great continuation of the first three movies. There weren't as many scares, but I still loved the story and it blends well with the other three. I highly recommend this to those wanting more of the story. Not so much to those only wanting scares though. There aren't many and most do not start until an hour in.
B00AM7E4LM|2.0|Yes that is his super new technique .. common sense ...<br /><br />but as its said &#34;common sense is not the most common of sense&#34; if you want to learn something new and you do not know how to start read this book...<br /><br />The book have a brief description of this &#34;method&#34; to learn ... and then some chapter as how he learn new things ... but he doesn't show really how he apply his &#34;method&#34;.. and well a lot of filling content on each chapter for every learning chapter ...

B000YABS8E|5.0|Great movie for everyone. It has romance, comedy, and action. Everyone should watch this movie. I watched it with my kids and hubby.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|This movie was a great blend of tension, humor, kids acting like adults, adults acting like kids, teenage crushes...not normally a movie I would watch but very entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Looked very interesting, fun and cute with great graphics but every part of the game took about 5 minutes to load and then it just completely froze. Uninstalling.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This was a page turner.  It has a little bit of everything. Good battles, some magic, decent character development, and a tiny pinch of romance.
0205313426|5.0|If you want to improve your writing, buy this book.<br /><br />If complicated sentence structure takes you down a path you fear to tread, The Elements of Style is for you.<br /><br />A lot of information packed in a thin, concise, and easily understandable little book.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook has officially became \\"the place\\" where all nosy people, and drama queens congregate. I don't enjoy it anymore, and haven't for a couple years. I only use it as a source of contacts. Twitter and Google+ is all I use anymore.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Excellent beginning to end.  You are sure to enjoy it.  The characters are well developed and the story is fantastic.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this trilogy and I would love for it to continue more. It's so erotic but loving at the same time. Definitely spices up the bedroom.
0671004107|5.0|Book came in excellent condition. The book version was done AFTER the film treatment, and is most excellent. Glad to have it in my library.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Never did read this earlier in life. Enjoyed the insight into a long gone world but found the archaic style of writing a little complicated to follow at times. Overall glad I finally read this somewhat dark classic and very glad I did not have to struggle through it as a text in high school. Much better as an adult read without the analysis required as an assign, ent read.
B00CW665VI|5.0|So refreshing to read from the guy's point o view.  Drew is totally believable, funny, and lovable. I'd love to read more about Drew and Kate.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Wonderful insights into the psy race and into Kaleb. This novel is the balance. I would recommend reading the whole series ,you won't be disappointed. Nalini Singh has done it again with her smooth writing style and perfect pacing.<br />The five star rating goes for everything, writing style, plot, pace and entertainment! Thanks Nalini for this great offering.You are up there along with all the great paranormal genre authors!!!!
0553801473|5.0|I liked this book. It didn't have the long drawn out feel that the last two novels had.  One thing is that the ending totally left me wanting more!  I don't know how Martin will meet my expectations in his next novel, which he's not evening starting until January 2014.  However, I do hope this ties up everything and I can move on.  I'm in limbo until the next.  :)  Thanks to George RR Martin for the story that he's woven so very well.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love reading this author's books really a great book can't wait to read more of her books. Love all her romance books.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great read. Makes one wonder about what goes on and the average American doesn't have a clue. Thanks for another great read.
140006922X|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  Aslan has inferred a stirring narrative from the few available fragments that attest to Jesus's historicity.  Aslan convinces us there is no way that Jesus could not be political in the time and place he lived. The narrative is seamless and jargon free and moves quickly -- a victory both in its clarity and scholarly excellence.  The book will outrage the extremist right, the Pat Robertson style con-artists and snake oil salesmen, the devotee of petrified scholarship and the ignoramus, as well it should.  What a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Aslan argues that the Gospels and other Biblical accounts are not history, nor did their adherents expect them to be.  History as we know it now had only slenderly begun to exist.  The few references from Tacitus, Josephus and others require us to infer and speculate.  In the hands of the propagandist or nut job, this is an invitation to lie.  In the hands of a scholar like Aslan, it is a divine opportunity.
B005VMSATA|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie! The negative reviews are wrong, in my opinion. Ryan Reynolds did a great job, I liked the story, and Mark Strong as Sinestro was amazingly awesome (as always).
630463949X|5.0|I bought the dance on a vcr version and still liked it. So I got the dvd version of it. It is also similar to the cd.

B002K0WBXW|5.0|I liked it because of the characters in the movie. The love/hate relationship. Bettie White plays the grandma and she is funny in this movie. If you are the hopeless romatic see this movie.

B001OFJPIS|5.0|Think Jesus is coolest theologian figure? Well, think again. Hellboy II: The golden army is jammed pack with more action and great plot than the New Testament. It's a must see.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|The music is just like the movie. If you have watched the movie; you would also like the music for the movie.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Awesome kickass movie. Can't wait for #2. This movie is full of awesome kickass stunts and the awesomeness of all the actors.

0060558121|4.0|I knew coming into American Gods, it was going to be a different type of book than I had read before.  It was not only different, but challenging and weird, though that doesn't mean it wasn't a good read.  The protagonist, Shadow, is released from jail days early to attend his wife's funeral and begins a surreal journey across America physically and metaphysically as a bodyguard to Mr. Wednesday.  Throughout this journey Shadow meets gods both ancient, or at least an American incarnation, and modern as his employer attempts to rally the older gods to rise up and challenge the newcomers.  Given his special relationship to Wednesday, Shadow is targeted by what seem to be forces in the government and thus has to hide away in the small town of Lakeside.  And throughout all of this Shadow must come to terms with his wife's death, though she keeps on visiting in various locations in the flesh.<br /><br />The structure of the book mainly followed Shadow who, like the reader, is learning that the gods of past are real and very much in the now though because of innate privacy the reader doesn't learn much about Shadow as a person throughout the book.  Yes, we learn things about Shadow but after spending almost 600 pages that his character dominates, we really don't know him.  While some could consider this a flaw, personally I thought it was a strength of the novel.  At the end of some chapters Gaiman, through the writing of Mr. Ibis, describes how gods arrived in America through the travels of their believers.  Throughout the book there are several &#34;interesting&#34; scenes which might be disturbing for some readers or just frankly too weird for them.  I'll be honest some of them were pretty out there, but knowing what I was getting into I was able to bare them.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I was glad to have spent the time I did reading it and there is no other thing I can say to recommend it.  But I'm going to paraphrase a statement I made earlier: it's different, challenging, and weird but that doesn't mean it isn't good.nt, challenging, and weird but that doesn't mean it isn't good.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Assuming this book attempts to give an accurate glimpse into life in a country where freedom didn't exist, but could only be obtained by cunning and courage, this story is worth the effort.  Evil exists, but goodness prevails in the end. A page turner... at one point, I could not read on, because of the cruelty and hopelessness, but the next day, I returned: realizing the possibility that truth and goodness might prevail. I couldn't abandon Leo. From that point on, I couldn't put the book down.
B004EPZ070|5.0|It was everything I hoped it would be.  And I got a free 24 hour instant video of it as well so that was great.
B002G01EPC|5.0|He is so spot on it's scary, and all his little parts are exciting to mix and match, especially those crossed arms. This is the best Piccolo figure ever if you're into articulation. He can be posed however which way, and you would be hard-pressed to break him by bending him a little too much. Also, his balance is awesome. I can stand him up tons of ways no problem. I mean come on, even his little feet bend all over the place. I love Piccolo, and this figure absolutely does him justice. The attention to detail deserves a whole army of thumbs up.<br />If you're gonna buy a Piccolo figure, get this one for sure. It's amazing. :D
B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|What could I say another outstanding recording by Cecilia.The entire review I read that just goes on and on about how this isn't Maria Callas.Thankfully Cecilia knows better and is following her own path.I thought it was Callas who said &#34;you can't doing these operas in the same old fashion and stage in the same way year after year&#34;.Now I am no opera expert by any means.But from that the books say this more the way Bellini wrote the piece.Eihter way if you are a fan of Cecilia than this is for you.To find anyone is music these days trying to make exciting recording and not just going through the motions .Than this is for you.If you never bought any of her music.This a great place to start.Make this your Mission to listen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so AWESOME and fun and since it's free it makes it that much more good !!!!!! I like that you don't have to spend real money on anything u just use bananas :):):)
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|I dont meen it as a bad thing, but you can tell in the music. I loved his old Bastard mixtape/cd. and his Goblin album. You see growth and more intelligence in this album. If you like any of the OFWGKTA, this wont disappoint.
0316227706|5.0|Got this for my sisters birthday present and she loved it....finally I got something she hadnt seen. or at least she didnt say she had seen it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun to do during your free time it actually is a lot harder than it seems it test your reaction time
B000W93CHC|5.0|Again, spellbinding and could not put it down.  Thought about it when I was not reading.  Love, love, loved it.
B00867HDTA|4.0|It's a fun game and rather addicting once you get into it! My granddaughter ordered it without my knowledge, but it is fun!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Similar to the Temple Run games but a whole lot moe fun!  Who doesn't love minions and bananas?  I enjoyed the variety of challenges in this and the different venues. My son (age 12) loves it too.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|Not a pleasure to read. Disappointing.  I expect better of Mr. Baldacci.The characters and situations were stale, trite and hackneyed.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Awesome movie for kids and adults. Cute with fun music and constant flow of the story line keeps it interesting.
B009AMAJPA|5.0|This movie is everything I thought it to be. I liked everything about it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies with a little drama, little killing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00428CPUY|5.0|This Crossroads Guitar Festival is great.  I have watched it over and over again and I never tire of watching it.  Great addition to my Crossroads collection.
B00513F9Q6|2.0|Interesting use of nostalgia to fill a book up. (Otherwise quite boring.) Wouldn't have read it but required for book club.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|This purchase was for me to share with my grandchild.  We both enjoyed the story and the time together.  I love making memories.
1936719118|5.0|Short, easy and inspiring read. Helps motivate you to make changes in your own life and teaches you how to work towards success in your professional life. The author seems like a pretty cool guy.
B0081JDMUW|5.0|Joe is a genius.  My husband is a guitar player and that is how I came to know Joe.  We have seen him twice in concert and he is amazing.  I have not heard anything of his that I do not like.  My husband's band plays a couple of his songs and they are always crowd pleasers.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I bought this GPS watch for my girlfriend and she loves it. She's been using it 4-5 times a week since I purchased it over a year and a half ago and it still works as good as day 1. It lasts about 4 days (3-4 runs) before needing to be recharged.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This was purchased at the request of my beloved grandchild.  She watches it all the time. Another Disney classic. It's a beautiful movie.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This is the 2nd time I've seen RED.  I saw it at the movies and it was great then.  Decided to rent the HD Video and it was like watching a new movie until it got to the end and I then recalled some of the parts.  It was well played, and the characters fit like a glove.  Its good to see some old timers, best the Gen-Xers.  Looking forward to RED 2
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Joe is a genius.  I have said it before and will say it again.  There is nothing generic about Joe.  You get geniune feeling in his guitar playing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is highly addicting love these little yellow guys and the funny things they do fun for all ages!!
159463176X|3.0|This was a 5 star book right up with the prior two and then it crashed about 2/3 through bringing it down to 3 stars for me.  After some initial confusion by the jumping around storylines I was totally hooked and loved the characters and story. The book is another page turner keeping me up too late at night unable to put it down.  He did a good job of not being repetitive of the first two books in plot or characters, but no less compelling.<br /><br />Then about 2/3 of the way through the book he goes off on a tangent story line to Greece and then I could not keep my eyes open to finish a section.  I kept reading on thinking this has to be a temporary let down in the story, but it continued on and on.  Then he finally left that story line and was back to the main characters but the story was derailed by that point and was a big disappointment.  I really felt like I had been watching a 2 hour movie on TV and the first hour was riveting and then someone changed the channel for a ½ hour and then returned to the movie and I had missed big parts leading up to the ending that was so much less than it could have been.<br /><br />He can follow up this book with a novelette called \\"The Missing Chapters\\" to cover the parts of the story he skipped, leaving to our imaginations.  If he would return to his writing style and depth into the main characters as in the first half completing the story by filling in the gaps from all the events he skipped over it might make up for the wasted chapters spent in Greece.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|very fun and entertaining! the challenges keep you coming back. also you are free to customize and make the reef your own.
B005LAII4E|2.0|Lots of shooting and blowing up but story line and acting sucked.  Bruce is Joe and it's aint funny. He just need to retire already because everything that he's been in since the 3rd Die Hard sucked big time.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|It was a modern fairy tail. Fun to watch.Danny DeVito was great, as the criminal car salesman, and her mother was a laugh. Reminds me of all the people, who have kids, that don't want them.
0307950689|5.0|This was deep, deep, deep, and I loved every exciting twist, turn, and surprise. Fantastic! I'm now deep in aother of his books.
B0095P33IW|5.0|I've always liked the Marvel superheros. This movie was a good example of drama and humor. Plenty of action and faithful to the comic.Hugo Weaving was a great villan.
0307346617|5.0|This product was actually a gift for my boyfriend and he seems to enjoy it a lot. We went and saw the movie a few weeks before and the book seems to be much better then the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great. I get to make and create whatever I want. Kids have an opportunity to be creative and use their imagination. This game has huge improvements in every update. I highly recommend this game to kids that love use their imagination.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I am not an artist, nor do I do anything in the 'creative' field. I work shift in manufacturing. Blue collar as one can be, but I must say that this is one of the best books I have read in along time.  In fact, it took only an hour to read, but do not let this discourage anyone from purchasing it.  The concept within this books can inspire anyone to be an artist in their own way.  Even if you are dissatisfied with your current circumstances, I think application of the concepts presented here will set you on the path to a more inspiring life, no matter what you choose to do.  I am taking the challenge set forth by this book.  I hope others will find the concepts presented within just as inspiring. I hope many non artists learn these concepts too.
B00C7DGQ9C|5.0|This is not your little kids Hansel and Gretel. The action was more than I imagined it would be anyone who like action flicks this is one you need to watch
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is very fun and addicitve, but I have purchased a token package and I have never received them. I have left 2 emails and haven't heard back. kind of dissappointed.
