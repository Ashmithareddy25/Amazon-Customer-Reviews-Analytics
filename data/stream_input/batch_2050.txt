B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A great start of the Jack Reacher series. Keep you interested from start to finish. Looking forward to reading the rest
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Great series. Wonder when they are going to spin off some other series from this show? Would be interesting to see how would go.
B0011Z32KI|5.0|Michael Buble is my favorite singer.  His music is relaxing, I listen to it a lot at night. I can not get enough of his music.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys easy listening music.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have the first temple run but this is much more fun.You don't have to buy gems with cash (which I can't)you can just earn them if you see a gem while running jump in the air so your character can get it.There is something in level 9 or 10 where one gem counts as two!!!!You should get this game!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think you will have fun with this app because I do it is a good way to pass the time and you won't stop playing it
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|Bought this for my sister who reported that she was disappointed with it.  I didn't listen to it at all but thought that I would report how the recipient felt about it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Beautiful graphics, fun story line, not just another look for objects in the same scenes game. The demo gives you plenty of play time to decide if you like it before you get it. I enjoyed it a lot and found it well worth the $2.99 price.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Not your normal zombies book. The characters are believable and make you want to just take them away from the horrors they are being forced to experience. There are many times in the book I forgot I was reading a zombies book.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing! I went to watch this movie in theaters twice. I would recommend this to anyone. :)
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I appreciated the film's historic accuracy and overall cinematography.  The actors captured the passion and depth of the characters without exception.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|What a strange but compelling family of characters the authors have created in this series. I look forward eagerly to the next!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|ITS GREAT! This modern game is very fun, I like the graphic details, the only thing that i dont like is the REALLY EXPENSIVE things
B007N5YIUS|5.0|ok i love this game, some times it can make me a lil mad and frustrated but i enjoy playing this game for hours
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read ALL the reviews for this before buying..whether good or bad, people were so passionate in the way they reacted to this story so I just had to get it- So glad I did, it was a great read!! Ah young love!! A very well put together story, you'd almost believe it weren't fiction! As soon as the next book comes out (from Travis point of view) I will get that too!!
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Received in great condition and watched as soon as received!! It was a great price to finish off my collection. Love it!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Loved the book and if u loved the lost hero and other Percy Jackson books, u will love this one too!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun. Much easier than taking care of my real horse. The manure just disappears! Nice! Excellent graphics. I recommend to everyone.
B003SI7OQ4|1.0|Dumb movie. Story unreal and changed from the real story.<br />Truly a piece of Garbage! Take it off the air now.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season two was awesome.  I am a history teacher and love the time period (World War I).  The characters you cannot help but root for!
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|Terrible story, Lousy acting. Stupid ending. How do you get stabbed on the side and walk away, fly a helicopter out to sea and survive a nuclear blast? The heat alone would fry you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The greatest show I have every watched and can hardly wait for more episodes!  As soon as the music starts, my heart starts pounding...
B009DH372Y|5.0|I appreciated the DVD.<br />I was happy with the DVD and it<br />Came fast and packaged nicely.<br />I would order again.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|A great movie for cold or rainy day stuck in the house.  Entertaining, but light and fun!  Feel good movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|lots of fun. big download but worth it. works great on kindle fire. no problems.fun fun fun. my daughter loves it. great realty horse game
B009VB97EY|3.0|Would have been a complete bomb without Channing Tatum.  The story line and the acting was very weak.  Thought Woody Harrelson was ridiculous!
B008518MOW|5.0|the story was good, as always. the 3d was decent enough. extras were kinda funny and interesting. it was a much appreciated gift
B008TMA1LY|3.0|Fun...but not enough opportunities to earn heart coins. Great game even if you are not a hello kitty (who you have to purchase) lover.
140053271X|5.0|This is an excellent product and the price is right! I have purchased one of these for my grandson, my grand daughter, my daughter and my best friend and now this one is for ME!  When I saw the price of this nook I thought it was time I treat myself and I absolutely love it! My grandson shows me how to load my books and it is so much easier for me to hold this and read than it is to &#34;flip pages&#34; I can also carry this in my pocketbook with ease without it taking up space, what a great invention. Little did I realize what a great gift I was giving until I got my own and I am saving tons of money not buying books! You can even set your font to the size you want so you don't have to squint to read, this is really a fantastic gadget!
B004HD61KE|5.0|Rollins just keeps getting better. The suspense, action ,and history are great. And a real cliff hanger at the end.
0743216385|5.0|Once again saw random episodes on TV of the miniseries made out of the book and knew eventially I would be getting the book to read. Love how I can see the miniseres taking place in my head while reading the book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end.  As a matter of fact it has been a while since I've read a book so quickly. It portrays a woman's struggle with Domestic Violence and had a surprise twist at the end.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I got this for the grandkids.  they do like to play this on my kindle fire.  My grandson will play it for a while.
B0043RSK3K|3.0|For me this was a very depressing read. Nearly every page suggesting what could have been and demonstrating its loss.
B004G6009K|5.0|I do like this movie.  purchased it for my grand daughter and I would watch it with her anytime she wants me too.
B004QBWU02|5.0|RELLY ENJOY THE MOVIES FROM AN ERA N WHICH I GREW UP IN.........WATCHED IT SEVERAL TIMES..HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU NEVER HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm the type of person who gets obsessed with a game and won't set it down. Right now this is that game. I would recommend that you get this game. 'Nuff said.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Like the game but I play it on the kindle fire. My daughter uses the ipod app and gets better updates and lower prices to buy items. Addictive but a little dissappointing. Fix this and I'd be a happy camper.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is amazing i could not find a problem with it besides that it seems to lag every once in a while but for the most part best FREE game on the market
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|The alarms did not go off!  This seems like a strange bug for an alarm clock app.  Used on Kindle Fire HD
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This shipped out very fast, and was well packaged. Now I just can't wait to watch it. This was a great deal!!!!
B002UM5BXW|3.0|I enjoyed reading up to a point. It's my own fault as cooking is not in my genes. All I learned is what I already know...someone could be spitting in my food.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Considering this is the first book I read about the mission and the fact that this person was there, I find all other &#34;experts&#34; and descriptions of what happened annoying as they are different.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game is wretched for the kindle fire. Personally I think the first of everything is far better. Now it has stopped working and I got it just a day ago. Its exciting for the first couple of minutes but then you'll hate it as I do.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|Having watched this movie with our children when they were younger, it was great fun to watch it again with grandchildren who had never seen it.  Glad we thought of it and I think you will be too.
B001C1066E|4.0|Great little coin purse, but is a little small and too well stuffed with fibers.  The product I received was not the same as what is pictured, not a huge deal, but the one I received had flat ironed on eyes rather than the pictured bobble eyes.  Still a good product for the Naruto fans.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I've Had This Game For A While It's Fun , a the Only Downside Is It Foreclosed And Forgot All My Coins Money And New High Score
B009RH973I|3.0|I didn't care for this very much, looks cheap and doesn't offer much protection , actually pretty flemsey. I now have a leather case and wouldn't use any thing else again.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Great game to keep you busy!  Very entertaining and no bugs.  Highly reccomend this game to anyone who wants to kill time!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Light, fun reading,entertaining.<br />An easy read.<br />Romantic and funny ,I would recommend it to people that like the Harlequin love stories.
031603441X|5.0|I bought this book at the request of my brother for Christmas.  He is really enjoying the read.  The book came quickly..thank you so much!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I'm hooked. I need closure.  There are so many unanswered questions.  Who will win the Iron Throne?  I need to know.  I MUST KNOW!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|This is one of those books that becomes a part of your everyday routine. I own both the digital and physical versions. The reason being is so I can take it with me when I travel. I have tested many of the suggested body hacks and have yet to be disappointed. I own and have read all of Tim Ferris's works and he has yet to let me down. I recommend this books to anyone who wants to hack their way to a better body and quality of life.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Some of the sounds take me back to places I've been and they are very relaxing.  The first night I used it I slept better than I had in awhile.
B002N83H52|5.0|The Man Who Loved Books Too Much, penned by Allison Hoover Bartlett, paints the portrait of an underground thief known as John Gilkey. Gilkey, raised by a lenient family, does not believe in right or wrong. He believes in winning and losing.<br /><br />Ms. Bartlett does a fantastic job researching her subject, both man and mystery. It's hard to believe, when I picked this book up at a closing Borders, that I'd be so protective of it. I never want to let it go. The story was so compelling I actually, PURPOSELY, read slowly. Having only 14 chapters, it is a light read.<br /><br />Gilkey never fails to fascinate. He started stealing rare books in 1999, believing that a man was only as good and as noteworthy if he had a private collection of handsomely rare books. He printed out a list of 100 classic books. He wanted to collect them all. So, on his journey to acquireThe more books, without paying for them, he concocts schemes and excuses to get his way. First he starts with credit card number receipts, using the number over the phone to a bookdealer and walking in to collect the book later. But from there, his schemes become more elaborate and creative. It just goes to show what man will do, what lengths he will endure, for a good book.<br /><br />Not only do with get to know the lowly thief, jumping from bookshop to bookshop across america, but we also learn of the man who tracks him down: Ken Sanders. He's a gruff, tough, no room for enough businessman who believes that John Gilkey made off with thousands of dollars, hurting the booksellers. Though we know that he is correct, there is something seductive in turning these pages. I guess we're all trying to find the method in the madness.<br /><br />Bartlett even outlines book thieves in history, who have actually maimed and killed people, even burning down their houses, to acquire one rare book. Now that's what I call a Bibliomaniac.<br /><br />Gilkey, never wanting a downside to his life, offers many different ways that the book could end. Like the diligent listener that she is, Bartlett hears him out. All of the concepts sound interesting. He offers to open his own bookshop, write detective novels starring a character similar to himself, perhaps produce author Bobble heads to give to people who send him books. A man as obsessed as Gilkey had me hooked from page one.<br /><br />I give this five out of five stars. Do yourself a favor and read this one slowly. Savor it, because it's just that good.at the book could end. Like the diligent listener that she is, Bartlett hears him out. All of the concepts sound interesting.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is the best Batman movie in my opinion.  It is not only for the comic fans, but the movie is so well made that anyone can enjoy.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Usually, I watch the Bourne movies because my boyfriend likes them.  I was hesitant to sit down to yet another one- but SURPRISE.  This one is faster-paced with more twists and turns. I was fully engaged for the entire film.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I just knew dogs had opinions and thoughts ! Loved the relationship between enzo and Danny. Always a dog person, looking at my three furry friends with new appreciation!
B006LSZECO|4.0|We are reading this nbook for our Feb book club selection. I'm still angry with the ending! I like closure. What can I say?<br />I am recommending Gone Girl to friends. I also recommended it to another book club.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I could not give this book any less than five stars as it gave me the very wonderful feeling of knowing just a small measure of the greatness of Abraham Lincoln, both in his person and his contributions to the history of the United States and to the world.<br /><br /> In 1909 Leo Tolstoy said, \\"Of all the great national heroes and statesmen of history Lincoln is the only real giant. Alexander, Frederick the Great, Caesar, Napoleon, Gladstone and even Washington stand in greatness of character, in depth of feeling and in a certain moral power far behind Lincoln. Lincoln was a man of whom a nation has a right to be proud; he was a Christ in miniature, a saint of humanity, whose name will live thousands of years in the legends of future generations. We are still too near to his greatness, and so can hardly appreciate his divine power; but after a few centuries more our posterity will find him considerably bigger than we do. His genius is still too strong and too powerful for the common understanding, just as the sun is too hot when its light beams directly on us.”<br /><br />That is exactly how I felt as I finished this book. This book gave me that as no text book or history teacher (sorry Mr. Pelzel) ever did.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I've been wanting this product for years but honestly had no use for it. I recently became a firefighter and with all the downtime I get it, this was an amazing investment. The pictures do not do this product any justice. The G155 is truly a must have for a gamer who spends a lot of time away from home. Simply perfect.
B006QPX7UI|3.0|This movie was good, but the book was much better. I was a little disappointed by the portrayal of the main characters in the movie.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I read a lot of books. I was thinking today what my favourite book in 2012 was.<br />Not only did Wool spring to mind as my favourite, but it has overshadowed every other book I read as it is the only one I remember reading.<br />If you like dystopian classics such as Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, etc, then this should be high on your to-read list.<br />Suspenseful and chilling yes, but the all-to-plausible notion of us being locked away for our on safety at some point in the future is what hits home for me. The one ideal that we all hold dear to our hearts, our freedom, is shattered and I hope all readers question the notion of mass public safety and what this may mean for us in the future.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like how you have to play games to  get games . The games are so much fun to play
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This was a great movie, really enjoyed watching this with my toddler aged daughter on our family movie night! Five stars!
B0063IH60K|4.0|this was definately worth it.  Downloaded easy no problems and plays great.  The whole family really likes it to play.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun easy way to kill some free time just wish the energy refill was a little quicker so that you didn't have to stop all the time.
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|David Baldacci always writes a good book no matter what the subject matter might be as quite a lot of his biooks vary on subject matter.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I loved this game the first time i played it and then it just automaticly stopped working! the writer. Thanks!9
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Good to see Harry Bosch is still alive and kicking.  Have followed the Harry Bosch series for quite a while and they are always enjoyable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in two days. I could not put it down. There is a twist at every corner. You fall instantly in love with the characters and just can't wait to read what happens next. I'm sad is over.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Just finished reading this book, enjoyed it immensly, It is a great pity that this looks like being the last of the Harry Hole books.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Sade has done it again. It is a very simply done concert but from beginning to end you are stimulated. The music is timeless and the performance was just hypnotic. I gave this as a gift and almost took it back! If you like Sade's music and enjoy her videos then this concert performance will not disappoint.
B009K0OL06|2.0|No one in this thing seems believable.  I watched like two episodes and then started watching Deception.  Revenge is too contrived, but it seems to be doing OK on tv.  To each their own.
B005OK722U|4.0|I love the hostel movies. I loved the second one best though. This one is good as well but it wasn't the best of the three.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I own 35+ knives and use the hell out of them. To put it simple, this BK2 performs as good as or better then anything I've purchased for 4-5x the price. I spend 100+ nights a year in the wilderness and this knife makes every trip (along with a bigger chopper and a folder)! Kinda makes me mad because I have a few $200+ blades that don't make the trips anymore! If you want a \\"do everything knife\\", In my opinion this is as close as you get. Buy one.....you'll see.
B0012GMVSU|5.0|there was allot of good music on this! I love the whole thing , I have listened to it many times since I got it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show to watch.  It captures your attention and you can't wait to see what is going to happen on the next show.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I love twilight. Even if everyone around me hates it and makes fun of it. I love it and I now own all except part two of breaking dawn
B0085W09ME|2.0|only American air. no extra add on 's or wat to get stuff like escort, help, handicap service. no other airlines to compair prices.
B0033G9OFA|5.0|I love this album it has many great songs in it and not like one can go wrong listening to this!
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I am disappointed with this app because there are a lot of websites that I can't get with this app.
B000002AQQ|5.0|I have already loaded this on my ipod and my computer . Great sound track to listen to . I love it.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My daughter and I watch the movie and we thought it was great. It's wonderful that Amazon offers Kiddle users movies that the family can watch together.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I loved the movie I just wish they didn't have the actress who played Fat Amy. I didn't care for her part at all I didn't find her funny at all if anything she was the one who was always quick to pass judgement on others. Finding no fault of herself.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Very cute movie as is all the Ice Age movies.  we had some connection problems but other wise I would recommend it.
B000W93CHC|4.0|This was a wonderful character driven story. I rooted for the star crossed lovers & longed for the<br />villains to receive retribution. The only fault was the detailed descriptions of architectural designs.<br />I often skipped through those pages.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Great book!! Nicholas Sparks always sucks you right in to the story.  I would deffinetly recommend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this app for my children and have found myself playing more than they have. The graphics are wonderful and realistic. LOVE THIS APP!!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Outstanding. Directing, acting, everything in it was done well. If you liked the first 2 Godfather movies, you will love this one.
B00005NKK8|5.0|Come on!  How could anyone not listen to this at work or in the car and not remember every emotion from the movie??
B007ZD17XO|5.0|One of the better match 3 games out there. I just started playing it, but so far I really enjoy it.
0345803485|4.0|There are so many who think this book is terrible and Austin keeps being referenced. I don't think this book is supposed to be like Austin's books - it's erotica. The story does have a lot of the same details as Twilight but if you look on the author's website this book originally started out as Twilight fan fiction so that explains it. Although there is a lot of repetition I think the sex scenes are well done - obviously they aren't realistic but isn't that why we are reading this stuff - it's fun and it's fantasy. Check out Penthouse Forum - those are not true either but they are erotic. Someone in a different review referenced the Beauty novels by Anne Rice being superior to the Fifty novels; I made it half way through the first one and just cannot pick it up again - talk about repetition - how many times can someone be spanked - and I really couldn't connect with the characters at all I was bored to death with it all. But then I'm not really into BDSM - so I find the Fifty novels a lot more erotic because there is some \\"vanilla\\" sex with a hint of the risque for us boring housewives. While the writing was not excellent I think the story was good and I connected with the characters; wanting to find out what will happen next. I enjoyed it thoroughly and went right on to the second book. Bottom line is there are different strokes for different folks and if you are into BDSM you probably won't like this book because it won't do it for you and if you want straight erotica you probably won't like it either because it has a story line.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|it was good, real good. better then the 80's version. be warned it's ultra violent. in the end it was good
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|Nice box, but I do not like the plastic cases.<br />For some reason, image quality of Animatrix blu-ray is not as good as it should be.<br />Best deal for the Matrix Collection on the market, anyway!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This movie is so blah. I really couldn't get pass the fake wife who was like 90lbs was basically the toughest person in the whole movie.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|A must have for any blu-ray collector!<br />Image quality is beyond anything know at this point. A cult for the moving image!<br />Music and audio quality in this movie is spectacular!<br />The only thing I did miss for the first time was a second disc with dvd version. I wanted to lend the movie to some friends that do no have blurry player, but I could not because of this.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|The first time I heard Alt-J I wasn't so sure. What initially pulled me back to them thought was the line &#34;Triangles are my favorite shape&#34; in the song Tessellate. Something about that just caught me, and made me realize that there was something going on here that I didn't know about. Well, after a couple weeks of finding myself again and again looking them up on Spotify for another taste I decided it was time to invest. After that it took no time at all before they had infiltrated my brain and taken over completely.<br /><br />I don't always care so much about whether or not music manages to do something &#34;new&#34;.  I think &#34;newness&#34; is generally pretty over-rated actually, or at least the single minded pursuit of it.  But something like this album...<br /><br />It feels to me that in this case the incredibly unique sound wasn't the goal, but instead more of a bi-product of a group of people really digging down to the core of things, to their own core, and getting to that point where in order to stay true to yourself you can't help but revolutionize.<br /><br />Music like this makes you look forward to the future while still reconnecting to the past. It brings people together. It does exactly what music is supposed to do. Good work.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Beautiful box-set! Beautiful artwork! I can't believe I did get a package like this for this price!<br />Much better packaging than Lord of the Rings Extended Blu-ray Edition!<br />A must have for any collector!
B004DM0UII|5.0|I downloaded this app when it was free, a while back and it has continued to impress me. I love being able to listen to any kind of station I want while no do other things at the same time. No lag, no catch, just awesome. If I had to pay for it, I'd gladly do so!!
B0037KMHRY|5.0|The CD is completely black on one side. The upper side has an identity disc printed on.<br />Like the non-plastic case!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was so surprised to see that this was free to download I'm so happy but I haven't played it yet. I still rate it five stars
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I have watched every single one of the Batman movies and I have t say that this one is right up there with The Dark Knight. I loved Tom Hardy's Bane and I think Anne did Selina Kyle justice. The movie keeps you on the edge and I absolutely LOVED the twist at the end!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander's experience was unbelievable. His knowledge of the medical facts added a lot to the substance of this book. I would have appreciated more of what he could reveal of the information he received while in the coma. It was still an interesting read.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|Not suitable viewing for children though yet it is fantastic storylines and artwork. Good way of purchasing a dvd as it holds it in their own library for you. Watched it on PC and X box
B00755MHXG|4.0|An interesting story about acceptance - would be suitable for a wide range of ages to read. I'll be interested to see what my young nephew thinks about it
B000002JSJ|5.0|so good and so cheap. love having all the discs of the bands i love. this is the longest review i ever had to do
B005EGXTHG|4.0|The horror of the Hunger Games just over for Katniss and Peeta, this novel picks up from where the last book left off, as they deal with another threat in the form of President Snow, who is incensed by their defiant act that made them the first ever dual victors in the history of the Games.<br /><br />Comparisons to the first book in this trilogy is inevitable, even if it is unfair. After the adrenaline-pumping action of the blood-soaked arena where 24 tributes battle to the death, there is an undeniable lull when this second book begins, as Katniss struggles with the love triangle she is caught up in with Peeta and Gale. To Collins's credit, even though this is a young adult novel, she manages not to overindulge in this aspect of Katniss's concerns (perfectly normal for a seventeen-year-old), but manages to turn the story's focus on the districts' growing discontent and seething rebellion against the Capitol and its tyrannny of fear and oppression. Katniss begins to realise that the roles she and Peeta play have the power to overthrow this oppression, and she has to decide if she can compromise the personal safety, and that of her loved ones, for the larger good.<br /><br />The action picks up at breakneck speed again about two-thirds into the book, as Katniss finds herself reliving her worst fears, but this time with a conflicted agenda but a firmer resolve. The cliffhanger at the end ensures that readers will want to find out how it all pans out in the conclusiive volume, \\" Mockingjay\\".<br /><br />This is definitely one of the better-written novels for young people. Collins is adept at writing action sequences that are so impactful sensorily that I often found myself recoiling from the force of a blow or reeling from the suddenness of an unexpected attack.
B0011EU0NG|4.0|Throw back to a more innocent time in kids movies, I have such fond memories of this movie as a kid that I loved sharing it with a friends kids. They found it at time a bit slow but I attributed that to watching mostly quick moving video games. The boy 6 fell asleep but the girl 8 love it and sang some songs from the movie the next day. I hope one day she'll share it with her own children.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|While I enjoyed this book, and found it chock full of interesting historical facts and backstory, at times it felt ponderous and slow. It did help tremendously when watching the movie, Lincoln, though, as it filled in many of the gaps of who's who etc. This was a fascinating read, but don't expect to be swept away by a gripping tale.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Perfect for on the go gaming, everything works great and fits perfect.  I use this to take my ps3 to work and back home and it protects everything nicely. I would recommend this to anyone looking to have a complete on the go gaming experience it is all you need.

B0097EWK3A|2.0|I almost got to the end of this game, then there was some kind of technical issue with one of the last puzzles and I am unable to finish the game. I paid 3 dollars for this game and this carp happens .<br />I liked this game. The storyline was good the graphics are very nice and the game play was good.<br />I am going to complain to big fish and see if I can get my money back.
0345803485|1.0|I bought the trilogy and only read the first two. So poorly written. I hated them. I cannot see what all the fuss is about.

B0085P2Z6E|4.0|A lot of fun just too much dialog and you need to go to menu every time you complete an objective. Would like to select once for the game or for each level.
0345803507|1.0|This is what everyone considers kinky?  Really? Really?!  I feel super sorry for the sex life of the average American.

B008JOLG7U|5.0|I have always like Jennifer Lopez but with everyone trying to lose weight now, it's a great CD to work out to as well!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I have been listening to the Lumineers nonstop since I bought this.  I have a great time singing along.  The music is upbeat and happy.  I would reccomend them to anyone!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just started playing and I'm already hooked. Though, it wouldn't let me change the user of mine or type numbers. It always says invalid user for every single thing I put.
B009PU2SX8|4.0|I am lucky to have heard about Gary Clark Jr.  I love his music & was able to see him live and it was the best.  Saw interviews with him on youtube and he is calm and spiritual man.  Check it out!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the graphics and the new obstacles. I love that it's 1 giant monkey instead of 3 but I don't like is how when I jump the big monkey blocks my view.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had so many twists and turns.  Just when you think you have the plot figured out, it changes.  Very exciting read, keeps you on your toes.
B00A8GBW3U|5.0|I've sarcastically enjoyed Lana for a while and finally broke down and decided to admit that I really like her and buy the album. I love it! Only being familiar with the songs from Born To Die, at first I thought the songs on Paradise were a bit slow, but now I love them. They are the background soundtrack to my life right now. I'd definitely recommend!
B001NHNG64|5.0|The book was well written with great precise detail. This book was a definate page turnner. Looking forward to getting book 3.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in theatres, so I bought it on DVD right away. It is a wonderful film. Wes Anderson is a great director and the acting is very believable. I made my whole family watch it and they all loved it -- even my grumpy grandfather!
0062124293|5.0|A mix of philosophy, feminist critique, and humor. Loved the book for Moran's intelligence, ease in which women can relate to her, quirkiness, and realism.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|i enjoyed the b&w version for years . it is great i have the 2 versions now. i lost or misplaced my old copy and couldnt find a new one at our local stores . when i did find 1 it was double the price you charged.  thank you, judy stevenosky

B0087YYHZU|5.0|Bought this as a gift for someone. How could it not be great? It's Gene Kelly!! A wonderful classic that every movie lover should own.
B003274QH6|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my son in law.  It arrived very fast.  I will borrow it when they are done watching.
B008MF3OEY|4.0|The Verso Prologue Marble Blue is more than a Kindle cover that offers protection and carrying convenience. It's a fashion statement and a classy one at that with its elegant (faux)leather-bound book design sure to stand out or perhaps blend among 'real' leather-bound volumes on a bookshelf.<br /><br />As a cover, the hard or hardened leather spine and the probably plastic flaps should keep a Kindle safe and unscratched if dropped. The elastic straps holding the 4 corners keep the tablet safely attached to the cover without obstructing the screen. The soft, black microfiber interior is a good match to the exterior's light brown with gold engravings and it's a good match to Kindle's own black. Extra utility is provided by an interior pocket that could hold... something.<br /><br />But there's a price to pay for elegance. This hand-made cover has no lock mechanism - only gravity and the wearer's grasp keep it closed. And, there is no documented 'viewing stand' mode. While the 'no lock' feature is what it is and you either accept it or look elsewhere, you can actually turn the cover into a pretty good viewing stand and it can be done easily by folding back the front cover. It works well on any not-slippery surface - tested it on glass, leather and some rugged fabrics - and it only takes about half a second to set it. The front cover actually folds back all the way or 180 degrees if you want to one-hand-handle your Kindle, perhaps for reading.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved It!!  I wanted it to continue!  Very well written especially the parts with Kevin and how he keep repeating things!  Now I can't wait for the movie!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My kids have being playing it for a week already.  It is not an educational game, but they love it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I liked the book lot ! I've never read anything like it and can't wait to watch the movie!!!a must read:)
B00AHHODH2|4.0|The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club by Duncan Whitehead, is a short novel that sort of defies a specific genre. I suppose one could place it in the mystery suspense thriller group and be OK. But, there is touch of satire thrown in as well.This book has about 196 pages, and I believe the publisher is Dog Ear Publishing and is a 2012 copyright.Gordonston is a nice neighborhood in Savannah. On the surface it's a place anyone would feel comfortable living in. There's a nice park where on any given day you can see the citizens walking their dogs. You might notice three older middle aged women, sipping cocktails out of paper cups and enjoying each other's company while they gossip and let their dogs play.However, appearances can be deceiving. These lovely ladies just lost one of their best friends to cancer. Other residents of this quite neighborhood have their own problems as well. Doug and Veronica are having money problems. Tom and Kelly are just too good to be true, both beautiful and healthy and in love, until Kelly wins a trip to Paris and Tom can't go.Elliot just lost his wife,Thelma, to cancer and his running for mayor. He's worried about something from his past coming out before the election.Then there is a gentleman that refuses to pick up after his dog after walking him in the park. The ladies vow they will have address this issue.Slowly, we see this idealistic, charming neighborhood become a hot bed of  jealousy, greed, dark secrets, lies, and maybe even murder. I had no idea what to expect when I started reading this novel. This is I believe the first novel for this author and if that's true, then I'm impressed. No one is what they appear to be on the surface and I promise you will never figure out what is going to happen next. Dark  humor and quirky characters, twist and turns abound. The tension builds to a climax that you never see coming.This is a unique, imaginative story, very different from anything I have read in while. I recommend this on for those who love a good satire, mystery , and a litte dark humor. Overall I would give this one a B.Thanks Netgalley for the the ARCe who love a good satire, mystery , and a litte dark humor. Overall I would give this one a B.Thanks Netgalley for the the ARC
B00B2V66VS|3.0|temple run 2 is extremely awesome and the graphics are amazing, and I love it... but after 6 or 7 times being played, every time you tap it wanting to play, it acts like its loading, then all by its self it exits out of the app! the only way to fix it is to uninstall and then install it back, but all your progess just vanishes which I think stinks.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Seasono one was everything I've been told it would be!  Even more excited for the second season to come out on DVD!
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|It explains clearly the reasons behind the failure of nations. It is also easy to read and has a good support from history to confirm this statement.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Awesome DVD set includes the Is ti fall yet movie and the is it college yet!. The bonus conetent is awesome as well.
0765325950|5.0|I can't believe it is over.  Over 20 years of waiting for the end, and while some people may not have the ending they want, it is AN ending.  Read it and enjoy it for what it is, a labor of love.  Oh and everyone giving one star reviews and not reading the book??? You are missing out on an awesome ending! The joke is on you!
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|WHO DOES NOT LOVE A  CLASSIC CHRISTMAS MOVIE!!<br />It was a movie I watched as a child & now with a child of my own I wanted him to see the movie as well.
B002YCVX5S|3.0|The movie was great.  The presentation was awful!  The movie froze twice for no reason.  Netflix works much better.  I expect more from amazon prime.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Great kids movie! It is a movie even the parents can enjoy the first couple of times.<br />Great All-Star cast with a cute message as well
0756404738|5.0|&#34;The Name of the Wind&#34; was riveting and the writing was so very graceful and elegant, that I had high expectations for &#34;The Wise Man's Fear&#34;.  This book certainly is worthy of the 1st one and I suppose, with Kvothe getting older, the writing would shift to the more adult subject of sex.  In spite of a rather lengthy sexual encounter, (maybe there will be a call back to substantiate this chapter), I am eagerly waiting to see what happens on the 3rd day.  And yes, if someone is looking for a new author, I will without hesitation and with extreme confidence, volunteer the name of &#34;Patrick Rothfuss&#34;.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|THE BEST KIDS MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN A WHILE!!<br />IT IS A MUST WATCH FOR KIDS AND PARENTS!<br />GREAT MESSAGE FOR THE PARENTS AND KIDS!
0765365278|5.0|This was actually the 1st Brandon Sanderson book that I read and I was very caught up in the plot and characters.  I was so enamored with this book that I read other Sanderson's writings such as the Mistborn series and was pleasantly suprised by how much the author has grown.  The characters are much more satisfying and the battles are vivid and picturesque.  My only gripe is that Mr. Sanderson is so busy, I wonder when we'll be gifted with the next book in this series.  Waiting and Wishing.
B002361MLA|5.0|I am still in the beginning of this book but I am already getting so much from it.  I've read a lot of new age books and this one has really impacted me.  I love the way Eckhart phrases his thoughts.  I feel a difference in my life already.
B00004YLIU|5.0|I'm reviewing the vinyl edition of this album specifically, and not just the music itself.  From the moment you start the album, you'll immediately notice how much this album benefits from the warmth of vinyl.  The keys on Everything In Its Right Place will suck you in from the moment their sound fills the room.  Their is a width/presence to the tones that is oh-so-important to this album.  From the bass on How To Disappear Completely to the thick synth on Idioteque, there are so many key sounds in this album that benefit from the fullness of vinyl.  As many of the tracks on Kid A are more minimal, it's worth investing in this record to hear the truest representation of the tones that make this album as important as it is.  Trust me, just hearing the opening track this way is worth the price in itself!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a fun game takes skill ghoul it is worth the storing it is not like tempel run it has gems
B000093NLE|5.0|To start, I am reviewing the vinyl edition of this album and not just the music on the album itself.  I own all the Radiohead albums on vinyl and must say that for those that are trying to be selective, this is a must buy!  Whereas some of the earlier albums don't benefit as much from the vinyl treatment, this one is notably different from its digital version.  If you need an example then look no further than the breakdown of 2+2=5!  With the presence of the bass opened up on the vinyl, the tones of the bass and guitar during this breakdown in particular are superb!  This section of the song was already exciting but on wax it hits like a truck!  Other favorites of mine like Where I End And You Begin and Wolf At The Door also benefit from the warmth of a vinyl release.  They sound much closer to you and your living room, and for the aforementioned songs and others like Sail To The Moon, this makes the songs much more effective at selling their emotion.  Whereas on the digital version these songs might sound sparse, they sound intimate in their vinyl form and may convince you to change your mind if you were keeping any of them at arms length.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is ssssssooooo much better than the first yemple run and me and my sister take turns on it ALL the time! very addictive and i recomend it to all my friends. :)
B00389XV42|5.0|I'm so glad they didn't cancel Chuck, because we never would have gotten to this season, which in many ways is the most development of character and drama we get. I'm glad Amazon has these episodes! A must-watch for those who enjoyed the first 2 seasons!
0345803485|5.0|Thought I'd add my two cents since there are such widespread 'like/love' or dislike/hate' comments on this book/series! I am 2/3 of the way through '50 Shades' and I totally LOVE IT! Can't put it down actually! I happen to not have a problem with consensual, erotic sex between two adults, so I suppose that's a big part of my liking of this book. But I think Anastasia is witty, fun, and intelligent...and I love the whole concept how this guy is soooo into her!!! LOVE IT!!! (There, in a nutshell, is what makes it comparable to 'Twilight'.) I had heard it described as 'porn', and lo and behold, it is VERY HOT...but I feel that there is a LOT more to it than just the hot/steamy aspect since we are inside Anastasia's brain here. Bottom line is, if you are offended by unusual sex then don't read it. But so far I have only seen Christian as respectful and honest and SMITTEN! Sounds good to me!! :)
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I had some problems on the first time but you can fix it on time.<br />My boyfriend love it! ♥....thank you!
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|it seemed that my order was shipped by carrier pidgeon, I had foolishly expected that it would arrive in a timely manner, since it was being shipped from right here in GA.  Oh, well, it arrived, undamaged.  Better late than never.  I'll probably order from this seller again.
B00000K0DT|5.0|I do not know for sure how many times I have watched this, but I rarely watch movies more than once unless they are exceptional. This is one of those for sure! Great twists and turns, you will be in on the inside jokes the second time you watch.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Great story but too short n boring ending, good for a quick read n great book for my SK collection.
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|this game is fun however it freezes a lot and you have to exit the game. I enjoyed it lots
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Great Album.<br />Its a combination of rap and singing.<br />Helped pave the way for rappers like Kendrick Lamar and ASAP Rocky.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The content (conversations of the two main characters) of the book was too adult for high school students.  While I understand that children deal with adult issues the discussions between the two characters and the thought processes were of a more mature adults.  The two did not appar to match.
B0086700CM|4.0|My children will not put their new Kindle Fires down, and they love this Temple Run game.  They have enjoyed checking out the free games at the game store.  This game, Temple Run, seems to be one of the favorites.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|This is a brilliantly written show and I would recommend this to every one. Its going to be a sad day when it goes off the air.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its so good I love it much better then the 1st its awesome xD u should really buy this cool games go buy it lol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I was really surprised at how interactive and detailed this game is. Not usually a big fan of these kind of games but its deep enough to hook you.
1906735875|5.0|The artwork is a bit hit and miss, but that's to be expected with the length and breath of the life of 2000AD.  I have to admit that Bolland's work stood out from the others and were the highlight of the book.  It's the nostalgic stories that I was fascinated to read again and I wasn't disappointed. The book itself is of good production quality though there are some panels where there's an overuse of black did make the artwork a bit of a mess.  Overall a great collection of stories from the dawn of Dredd and a good introduction on how the legend evolved.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|This movie is definitely worth watching.  It has some funny scenes and a good story.  The main downside is the speed.  The movie could be shortly.  There are times when it is dragged out and gets a little slow.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There was never a dull moment! Good luck trying to put it down at the end of a chapter! Just one more just one more is what I thought then in no time I was finished with the first book. Can't wait to read the next!
B00AKKS278|5.0|I have been trying to make time for the important things in my life for years and felt hopeless about every getting it right. Life is so busy that I was always so tired at the end of the day. I also have always found it so tough to get up early. I have now gotten up at 5am for 9 days in a row and it's been easy and I am getting all my important life  improvement activities done before I even start work at 8. I am in great mental shape when I start my work day and feel invigorated and get a lot more done. I know it's still early days but I have never gotten past the two day mark in the past so 9 days in a row shows that I've actually created a brand new habit which I feel confident I can maintain.<br /><br />I was very skeptical about this book before buying it but once I got into it I found what it had to say just resonated with me and I found it very easy to feel motivated to try the steps suggested by the author. The steps are actually so simple which makes it all the easier to follow.<br /><br />Really great book!!!!
0385342055|3.0|It's good..not bad..Easy to read and funny as usual.  It's not as funny as other ones though.  I also found it just too predictable.
B00A757EFW|5.0|it is fun and fast.  we really enjoy playing it.  Pacman is so much fun!!!! We will continue to play it
0385338724|4.0|I like the book and the plot. It kept me interested.  It's a tiny bit depressing and sad but overall good.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Kindle is everywhere. My mom was an early Kindle adopter and this app has worked great for me on several different smart phones and tablets I have aquired and the content is available for any of them. I use other reader apps of course, but this is the primo one.<br />Enjoy.<br />Jb
030758836X|5.0|This is one interesting read and once you get started, you can't stop because you want to see what in the world the female character is going to do next in order to keep her control. Unbelievable and scary behavior!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|And now they have the service where when you buy the cd, the music goes to the cloud service and you can download them to your player. Excellent. I am very pleased with this improvement, it makes perfect sense!<br />Enjoy.<br />Jb
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Love the color purple...not too bright, just right.  The color would be appropriate for both women and men.  And the quality of the leather is great.<br />It is VERY easy to insert the Kindle into, the ability to rotate the is a plus, and the overall quality of the cover is top notch.<br />The only thing missing is a loop for a stylus.<br />I am very pleased with this cover.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|great series, very interesting, make you really wonder if it could ever happen in this country. great acting by all.
1449415881|5.0|How could you not enjoy the daily chuckle from Dilbert's world?  I get one of these every year for my husband who enjoys starting his day with reading whatever &#34;word of wisdom (?)&#34; comes from this guy...
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|i liked it alot, good performances all around especially from tom hardy and shia lebeuf. if you like movies from this time period, it wont disapoint
B00957T6X6|5.0|I started with the HBO series first, this is sooo much better, and I love the series.  I can't wait to read!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Interesting story. I believe John Green did a great job telling a story of an intelligent 16 girl who was dying.
B004G600A4|5.0|I normally don't like watching children's movies, but I loved this one.  My sister had a copy but I wanted one for myself too.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really enjoy all the G5 games that I have played. they have all worth the money to get the full version.  all though they could give us a full version free once in awhile.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I have made a thorough review of book three, which covers my opinion for all books in the series. They are OK all of them,. but must be read as a sequence - not as individual books.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These stickers were very pretty and there were lots of them.  They stick and restick very well, and the princesses are quite big and detailed.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|because they are not written to be read individually (maybe except the first). I always compare with Tolkien and I think that the author have borrowed a little too much from him - i.e. the scene in which Bran/Hodor etc. are at the well inside the great wall - it is taken almost directly from the Mines of Moria.<br />If you read these books for the action alone, you will get disappointed (although there are a lot of action), but the cement which cast it all together is the conversations and the thoughts the people share, and in order to get the full picture of the universe which George Martin presents, you need to read that as well - some will find that boring, but do it anyway and it will pay off as the full universe, present and past,  emerges for the reader.<br />I'm currently in book five - wonder when book six are being published.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app was really good. It's perfect for horse lovers, it's easy and fun to play. It is better for older children and young adults.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I have read a few books on life after death books and this one was unique. It was a refreshing look at it from a person looking at it in a scientific point of view with a touch of religion mixed in. The problem is that at times it was a bit too scientific as if he were talking to his peers which can get you lost thinking of what he is talking about.<br /> He did try to explain what he was talking about but at times it was a bit much and I not a science major, my only advantage is many hours of watching the science channel.<br /> Don't get me wrong, there were many parts of it that were a new concept and made it good to read and give you some new thoughts to think about. It was completely different from any other book of this type that I have read.<br /> Not really sure that if I had it to do over again if I would buy this again and I was torn between giving this 2 or 3 stars.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is one of the best authors of our time and he succeeds again with this book. I can't get enough of his work.
B004J0Q6FK|4.0|I listen to it like i always have an somthing other to fall back on.A very musica peak for the sonics,but nevertheless a stunning record that catches the right noise they have.
B003ZJ70W4|1.0|Seeing all of this movie is on my bucket list. It's been on my bucket list for about two years now because I can only seem to watch about 10 min of the film every three months or so. Not only is the behavior of the women vapid, superficial and embarrassing, I am fairly certain it would land them in jail in Abu Dhabi. They are in new outfits in nearly every scene and storywise, it's within the course of one day. Who changes clothing five or six times a day?! Horrible.
B000W2W4JQ|5.0|Everyone should have this book, and Katherine Woods does the best translation available.<br />A beautiful book.  I cannot recommend this enough.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My 8yr old daughter and I love this movie. It's very funny, clever and poignant and sweet. If you're a Steve Carell fan, you'll enjoy him in this!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a highly addictive game. It is much better then Temple Run and will keep you occupied for hours and days to come.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I do believe I ordered this for my Kindle which I haven't played in a long time so I can't recall if it was actually &#34;ad-free&#34; or not.  As far as the one for my phone, still has the ads.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app works better than I thought it would. I have had no connection problems or force closes, which is a plus!
B003VWU2WA|4.0|I picked this up after moving from a Logitech keyboard with media controls on it to a mechnical keyboard with nothing but the basics. My keyboard elitist friends laughed and kicked sand in my mouth when I said that I preferred to have easy access to a volume knob and mute button rather than using awkward keyboard shortcuts to accomplish the same tasks. Now I'm the guy with a cool cast-aluminum glowy knob on my desk that feels really nice to use, and they're a bunch of ugly knobless jerks who look like they're doing the Itsy-Bitsy Spider with jazz hands every time they want to adjust their volume from inside a full-screen application.<br /><br />The included software allows you to assign various functions to your knob's controls (twist, push, push and twist, and push harder). It's not as open-ended as standard macro software, but the designers were at least kind enough to include a function to send any set of keystrokes you want when a particular control is hit, so you can use your knob in conjunction with freeware macro programs like AutoHotkey to do all sorts of things, like playing a clip from your favorite Gangnam Style dubstep remix or doing your taxes. That will require some scripting, though.<br /><br />So, thanks Griffin Technology, for helping me cling to my desperate sense of superiority over my jerk sand-kicking friends. You should probably change the USB cord, though. Clear cabling is so 90s.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! I use it every day and appreciate that there are so many versions to choose from.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|I loved this app at first; then it started force closing everytime I made changes and since it never saves my location between uses, this happens a lot. there are better weather apps out there and they're free.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|This album is fantastic. I really like it!  Great music to study to. Also great mood music for when you're with the one you love ;-)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game but there is only one thing wrong for some reason when I tried to get in after a couple days of playing it it logs me.out maby one of you can.help me
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack easily accommodates all of your camera needs. Plenty of room for extra batteries and lenses.Seems durable and comfortable.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|The only book you need to read on weight gain and loss. Backed up by evidence, not based on ideas.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|I haven't used this much, but the few times I have it worked great for standing up my kindle to watch a movie. I'm glad I bought it.
B00A17AD36|5.0|The Weekend album is worth buying! I love all of his songs He is truly a great artist with a  genuine voice!
B00A50PE6K|5.0|I got this as a Christmas present. My friend love it .its cheaper than its if u go to target or best buy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is the same game my husbnd and I play<br />at the carnivals.  With this game you have to stop when you run out<br />of coins.  It is better than the Carnival game - less expensive
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Not sure how it scores, but I really like it !!!! When I think I will get 3 stars it just gives me 2...????.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|From the deepest place Americans can imagine this documentary has it. Living the American dream can be filled with disappointing and devastating circumstance but in review of this movie it is motivational, inspiring, and has lessons we all can learn from that shows how one man made the transition from a dream to ordinary life as he raised his family very humble and loving never knowing his dream was alive and touching so many lives! He rocks and so does this movie... A must see for anyone who loves life and is following their dream.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I loved Temple Run so I downloaded Temple Run 2.  I love the concept of it but the game seems to have some glitches that I am sure will be fixed over time.  Once all the kinks are worked out, I am sure that I will be able to give it 5 stars!
B0074Y2YZ4|5.0|this album is not as strong as previous ones, nevertheless, I want to support the Swedish pop rock group for continuing to motivate people and fans around the world<br />I wish they were more popular in the USA

B00B2V66VS|4.0|Oh my gosh it's awesome. I love this game, it only has four stars from me because there is less characters. It takes a little while to get used to, but still you should definitely get it. Temple Run Two rules!!!  : )
B0098460O4|5.0|The CD is great. Hard to believe two teenagers blend there voices so well. Better than they were on you tube
B000FC1MCS|5.0|My grandchildren (mostly teenagers) often pass along books to me that they view as 'a great story'. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was one of those books and it was truly a great insight into the world of autism. I was hooked from the first few pages. The fact that Christopher's mother abandoned him becasue 'he was a difficult child did not surprised me in the least. (It is more often the father who abandons the family) Sadly, some mothers are simply too shallow to raise a child who is not perfect. I passed this book on to a close friend who works with special needs children and she in turn recommended it to her co-workers.<br />If any one who reads this incredible book gives it a bad review then that reader simply does not 'get it' and is perhaps too shallow to see the beauty of  Christopher and his story. Perhaps drawn from fact and turned to fiction, this story leaves the reader wondering if 'simplistic thinking' (without all the analytical train of thought) makes more sense. Five Stars+ to author Mark Haddon.

0765325950|4.0|If you're already a WoT fan:<br />Read this. Sanderson wraps everything up as Jordan intended and does it at a good pace. If you've waited over a decade for the series to finally be over, pour yourself a nice drink. It's finally done. Also, read the last bit of this review.<br /><br />If you're considering getting into it (or getting someone else into it):<br />WoT is a truly epic series, with a story affected by millenia of lore, filled with a multitude of characters undergoing great change and maturation, and wonderful battles with attention to detail as well as tactical creativity. The series gets a little sluggish towards the end (especially in book 11 - the last one Jordan wrote as he was facing the end of his life), but I implore you to trudge onward as it's a very satisfying and epic read as Sanderson picks up the pace upon taking over and finishes the series out gracefully.<br /><br />Both:<br />Some people will complain about the ending, I'm sure. In my opinion, it was an okay ending. Not great, not bad, just okay. Perhaps it's just hard to wrap up such an amazing and epic story and leave readers both feeling satisfied and not sad the our heroes' journeys have ended. This, along with some slow points in the series in general, is why I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|It's an &#34;escape from underground compound flick.&#34; 'occasional pretty images, but lacking in any other form of expressed emotional appeal.

1250006341|5.0|I enjoyed the book as much as the series.  The book details the fashions of the day as well as the etiquette, upstairs and downstairs.  I haven't read the Chronicles as yet.  I'm waiting for season III to end.  I'll review it then.  Downton Abby fans will love this book.  It's definitely a \\"must have\\".
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Dealing with teenagers and their emotions is so hard, and no parent even knows what is really going through their heads as they only let you see what they want you to see or know.  And, as I have learned first hand, dealing with grief is handled so differently by each parent, as well as by men vs women.  This story covers all those emotions and pull you into the raw edges they are feeling so very well.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is the cutest Disney Princesss movie yet, set in Scottland. My child loves watching this and we don't mind it on all the time--so cute!
0807014273|5.0|I had heard of this book a few times before purchasing it. I'm interested in history and thought that reading Frankl's experience as a POW camp would fit right along those interests.<br /><br />The book goes into a bit of the actual experience that he had as a POW but the content is so much more than that. It's an excellent depiction of how we act in various circumstances. Frankl relates these stories with such clarity and purpose that the book sucks you right in!<br /><br />I'd HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways to view the world differently -- to view themselves and their circumstances differently. Such a great book!
B005KELW26|4.0|Did not fit my Kindle Fire HD.  I was drawn to the color more than anything, unfortuanately that style and color was not available for the Kindle I purchased.

B009VA1FN6|5.0|This is the first Kate Morton book I have read, she most certainly is a class writer.<br />I was told this novel was a must read and it was definitely one of my favourites over the last 12 months. The characters were all very endearing and her description of London during the blitz transported you to an unbelievable time for the young men and women of that era. Any family who has gathered around their loved one in the final days would be very touched with the caring account that Kate's writing displayed. If you're looking for a memorable read give this book a go, you'd be hard pressed not to find it enjoyable.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I know yall don't like it but it is a wonderful app to use don't listen to any one else ite great and fun to use
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Thus far book three my favorite.  So many twists and turns, so many names, places, sigels to remember.  Wonderful prose by Mr. Martin.  I do so love it when the bad guys get thiers but hate it when the good guys don't make it.<br />What an imagination Mr. Martin must have.  Enjoy this one.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|This game has been great and fun, but now I'm at the shed, and it won't let me attach the rope with hook to the cement block. :/ Help?
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Not enjoying this as much as book three.  There are soooooooo many names to remember and memory not my forte.  Maybe it's me and not Mr. Martin.<br />I do love the way he writes and describes things; almost feel like I'm there.<br />I think I'm going to have to re-read them. A friend has read them all at least 3 times and says he picks up things he missed each time.

B000SOZXJG|5.0|'Whale Rider', directed by Niki Caro, is a GREAT story about the struggle of the Whangara people of New Zealand to hold onto their roots in a modern day world.  Koro (played by Rawiri Paratene), the chief of the current-day Whangara people comes from a long bloodline of chiefs leading back to Paikea, the ancient ancestor who survived when his canoe capsized, by riding to safety on the back of a whale.  Since that time it was the first born male to the chief that became the next chief of the people.  Koro struggles throughout the movie to accept that his first born son gave him a granddaughter, Pia (played by Keisha Castle-Hughes), and refused to try for another child when his wife died birthing her.<br /><br />Throughout the movie Pia (Paikea) struggles to gain the trust and affection of her grandfather as he desperately seeks a worthy male in the village to become the next chief of the Wangara.  Through many trials and tribulations the chief is finally revealed . . . but not they way Koro expected it.  This heartfelt tale speaks of the fight Koro and the Whangara people face as evolution changes the ways of their sacred history. Great story, great acting. :)<br /><br />As a student of world religions I appreciate the depiction of an indigenous people struggling to keep alive the traditions of their heritage while living in a modern day world.  Not only do they face the struggle of their day to day lives, but they have a history with traditions and Koro, the chief, will do anything to keep it alive in his people.  From they way they are taught in school to Koro teaching the young boys of the village to become chief, this story has it all.  It speaks too clearly of the problem many indigenous people are facing today as the modern world steps in on their ways without a second thought to what might actually be going on.  Maybe stories like this can open the eyes of those who are still naive to this way of life.  That they are real people with real lives, even though itmay seem different than ours.
B004OO4UFY|4.0|I picked this up originally for the track that is on Bordelands 2. It turned out to be a solid album that veers between funk, soul, rock and R&B.

B000000OMP|5.0|Slide It In broke Whitesnake in the States and is a great album that has held up nicely. While their following self-titled album would make them huge with a pop-metal sound, Slide It In has aged more gracefully and has a tracklist that stays strong from beginning to end. The opening title track is a killer with a great guitar riff and a confident vocal performance from David Coverdale. The most memorable tracks were those that were released as singles/videos as both the sensuous \\"Slow an' Easy\\" and the super underrated power ballad \\"Love Ain't No Stranger\\", are great songs full of passion and drama. Jon Lord, who would rejoin Deep Purple soon after and contribute to another strong hard rock album in 1984 with Perfect Strangers, is the unsung hero of this album as his organ lines add a lot of color whether it's on the spooky \\"Gambler\\" or on the aforementioned \\"Love Ain't No Stranger\\". Songs like \\"All or Nothing\\", \\"Guilty of Love\\", \\"Hungry for Love\\", and \\"Spit It Out\\" rock with conviction and swagger and are full of great choruses and strong performances from the entire band. All told, everything here works and this album still smokes nearly 30 years later. Highly recommended.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is really great, I can stay in contact with family and friends. Also put my view points and daily word on Face book. I can also view pictures of family and friends.
B004IY6API|5.0|Like their album Sad Wings of Destiny, Judas Priest's fourth album, Stained Class, is regarded as a classic based more on influence than sales. Their previous album, Sin After Sin, found the band drifting musically but it was on Stained Class that the band truly found their footing. Much of the origin of speed metal was found on the riveting and challenging \\"Exciter\\" and the menacing title track. Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing's solos on these tracks as well as the rest of the album are wicked and Rob Halford's vocals are outstanding. Les Binks's drumming is also stellar regardless of the mood of the track. \\"Better by You, Better than Me\\" is a mid-tempo tune with a cool riff and some theatrics while \\"Heroes End\\" is a strong anthem that the band would perfect on their next release, Hell Bent For Leather.  \\"Saints in Hell\\" plays like a mini-epic with its changes in delivery and has a wicked riff that drives the verses. \\"Invader\\" and \\"Savage\\" are also very strong tracks. Finally, \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\", like \\"Victim of Changes\\", is one of the genre's outstanding epics and sadly they would stop writing these kinds of songs when they tightened their sound. All told, Stained Class is one of the great classic old-school metal albums.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Yeah this IS cool, but I like dragonvale to. This is the best game with &quot;story&quot; in the name. Only thing I don't like is you need the coins from the dragons to breed
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Robin Trower's second album, Bridge of Sighs, is an absolute scorcher of an album that was released at a time when hard rock had fallen out of favor in place of mellow pop music. Robin Trower is a wicked guitarist and his name is on the marquee but his rhythm section of bassist/vocalist James Dewar and drummer Reg Isidore are just as responsible for how strong this is. \\"Day of the Eagle\\" starts the album off like a runaway train, performed at a pace that was seldom heard at the time and then falls into a slow sick groove of which Trower shows off his six-string magic. That vibe continues in the enduring slow blues of the title track and the hazy \\"In This Place\\", tracks where Trower makes every note count, Dewar's vocals are emotional and haunting and Isidore plays with just the right touch. \\"The Fool and Me\\" is a strong rocker where Trower plays with a ton of fury while \\"Too Rolling Stoned\\" is arguably the band's best known tune and for good reason and is similar to \\"Day of the Eagle\\" in scope but a lot funkier. \\"About to Begin\\" is very mellow and the playing is tasteful throughout while \\"Lady Love\\" is an excellent melodic rocker where Dewar's vocals shine. The frenetic \\"A Little Bit of Sympathy\\" brings the original album to a close. The remastered version is a real treat with excellent sound quality and 8 bonus tracks that are rawer but just as impressive, several of which would comprise his next album, For Earth Below. All told, Bridge of Sighs is not only a great guitar album but a great album period. All fans of classic rock should own this.

B000063DHL|4.0|No heavy metal band was as consistently great in the 1980's as Iron Maiden and Somewhere in Time is another strong album from the British band. This was released in 1986 when some of the traditional heavy metal bands (most notably Judas Priest) started experimenting with keyboards or guitar synthesizers. While this style didn't work for Priest (who overdid the guitar synthesizers to the point of making them sound like a pop band), it worked for Iron Maiden because they used this sound more for color rather than making it their foundation. \\"Wasted Years\\" would be the first single/video and is one of their best as it has a memorable guitar line and dare I say, a very catchy chorus. The mid-tempo \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" was nearly as good and has become one of their best deep cuts. \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\" was another in a long line of musically challenging opening cuts performed at a frenetic pace (the band's opening tracks were the best of the genre, bar none). The highlights continue throughout the album as \\"Sea of Madness\\" is a riveting track that slows down briefly before coming back harder while \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" starts out quite somber with Steve Harris's bass synth line before becoming a classic metal track that changes tempos throughout yet it all fits. Other highlights include the killer epic \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\" and the wicked unison guitar lines that carry \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu\\". The last track, \\"Alexander the Great\\", while musically ambitious, doesn't touch the rest of the album.  All told, Somewhere in Time is another strong album from a band that had a ton of them.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Best quality I've ever seen! Story is great! Acting is great! Band of Brothers on blu ray is going to be next
B000WS4P5G|5.0|Although Danzig experimented with their sound throughout their career, they were never better than on their debut album. This has stood the test of time quite nicely. You still hear \\"Mother\\" and \\"Twist of Cain\\" frequently on the heavier radio stations and sometimes even \\"Am I Demon?\\" and there's a reason why. They had great simple memorable riffs and Glenn had the Elvis from Hell shtick down. All of the songs here are very good and the aforementioned \\"Mother\\" would actually be a big hit six years later at the height of grunge when featured on the EP Demonsweatlive. \\"She Rides\\" would become a legendary song in the strip clubs while \\"Not of this World\\" and \\"Evil Thing\\" had killer guitar lines that attracted fans of both punk and heavy metal. The songs \\"Soul on Fire\\", \\"Possession\\", and \\"End of Time\\" were more dramatic and were just as impressive. And what other band of the genre could take blues legend Albert King's \\"The Hunter\\" and nearly make it their own?  I stopped listening to this kind of music on a regular basis about 20 years ago. But I can still listen to this and get into it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game works good on Kindle fire HD.  The ads are not bad.  You need to close the ad before each game starts.  No big deal at all.  Great way to kill time.

If you are a type 2 diabetic you will be amazed at the improvements in blood sugar readings as you naturally lose weight and avoid foods that increase blood sugar.

I lost 25 pounds in 3 months and 2 inches off my waistline as well as getting my lood sugar values from over 200 to; 80 to 140. I believe the discovery of the evils of present day wheat (Modified 1950's) will be as important to our diet regiman as tobaaco was to our recreational habits in the 50's.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|You will understand, within minutes, why the novel Hopeless by Colleen Hoover shot to the top of the New York Times Best Seller List when words spill from the pages and catch in your throat.<br /><br />I turned page after page with bleary eyes, reading late into the night as fear gripped me waiting for the beautiful words to become marred with the ending, they weren't. Ms. Hoover is a weaver of tales. Once you begin to read, you will follow her as I did, wherever the story goes, because, in Hopeless, she has strewn the path with words too beautiful to miss. Hopeless by Colleen Hoover is a 5 star read! And for $3.99 a damn good bargain, and over three thousand Amazon.com readers agree! Can't wait to download more of her books. [...]

0553801473|5.0|Book arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner; the book itself is a welcome continuation of the Game of Thrones series, providing some answers to scenarios raised in the prior books, but pretty much ignored in the last one.  Definitely worth getting if you're into this series and an excellent specimen from the seller.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this backpack for my travels with my Canon T3 SLR.<br /><br />It has been six months and this backpack has protected my camera well on trips to Costa Rica, Cancun and Belize. The adjustable storage compartments are awesome and it even fits my iPad in it.<br /><br />The padding on the back and shoulder straps are very plush and comfortable. It is a nice subtle backpack that doesn't have the Canon logo a.k.a. &#34;Steal Me&#34; logo when traveling. With all the pockets, I keep my compact waterproof camera and charger in the backpack as well.<br /><br />The only knock I have about this bag is that it's smaller than a normal backpack and on me, it looks like a school girl's book bag... I'm 6'0&#34; and 245lbs with an athletic build. I look like a linebacker with broad shoulders and although the backpack fits well, it looks funny on me due to its small size.<br /><br />It'd be nice if the backpack zippers had a lock capable ring like other luggage zippers, so that the bag could be completely secured from being opened while traveling.<br /><br />I'd recommend this camera backpack to anyone who needs an SLR backpack at a reasonable price.

B0058YPGL6|5.0|This show is glorious and features B-level special effects combined with a shockingly compelling storyline. I was dragged KICKING and SCREAMING into this by internet associates and I've been hideously committed since the fourth episode. It functions incredibly well within werewolf lore, but the storyline has yet to be hijacked by bigger mythical baddies, a la Supernatural. It follows the events of a small town and the people within it working to keep a lid on the spooky madness while making sure the remaining inhabitants aren't mauled(too much). Post Season 2, I'm impressed by the depth of character they've managed to flesh out and look forward to seeing more the cast that aren't the Romeo and Juliet style leads (not that I don't have affection for them, but I need that psychological torment and crippling internal conflict.

B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Loved the movie. Paid extra for HD on my PS3 and couldn't get more than 2 bars, till the end got 4, never HD. Connection test on PS3 was over 9gb. That should be enough. Concerns me cause I was going to start buying all my media through amazon because of the a availability on multiple devices. I might use Vudu to rent if amazon can't fix this. Google it and discovered others have had similar problems.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Thanks for offering this series, fabulous acting and writing. Robert Carlyle is a fine actor, who really creates an empathetic troubled character with depth.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This book was well written and was a great introduction to the series of Jack Reacher which I started after seeing the movie.
B000WGYMAQ|4.0|Great product. Arrived quickly and as described. Packaging was intact and the movie played well on my blue ray. Completely satisfied.
0393338827|4.0|I recently finished Michael Lewis' `The Big Short' and was thoroughly entertained by this fast-paced, character driven re-telling of the 2008 Financial Crisis. I found myself alternating between shaking my head in disbelief, laughing out loud, to nodding in agreement, at the ignorance/gross negligence of some its characters, the audaciousness of others, the brilliance of some, and the unabashed greed of even more.  Given some of the detailed reviews that precede mine, I will focus this review on Packaging, Style, Storyline, and end with one of its more memorable Quotes.<br /><br />PACKAGING: The hardcover version of the \\"The Big Short' is approximately 12\\" x 8\\" x 1.5\\", and weighs in at a relatively trim 266 pages, spread across 10 chapters with a prologue and epilogue from the author bookending the prose.<br /><br />STYLE:  Similar to some of Michael Lewis' earlier works like Moneyball and Liars Poker, `The Big Short' tells its story in real time through the eyes of several disparate characters from across the financial industry,  resulting in a chronological re-telling of the financial crisis from several different points of view. The writing style is a mixture of anecdotal conversations, with background detail on various topics/events interspersed through the text when appropriate. The overall pace is quick, covering major storyline elements from 2005 through 2009. New character introductions come fast and often and simulate changing scenes within a movie, giving you a different perspective of a particular event, but simultaneously tying the story to the larger narrative.<br /><br />STORYLINE: The book starts with events that precipitated the 2008 Financial Crisis, the US mortgage market (circa 2005), creation and sale of mortgage-backed bonds to diversify risk, the subsequent repackaging and reselling of elements of these bonds into synthetic mortgage-backed CDOs, proliferation of credit default swaps, the eventual collapse of the underlying assets, the run on banks, illiquidity of the credit market and the subsequent catastrophic impact on the entire financial system. This primary narrative is interspersed with the experiences of several hedgefund managers, analysts and bankers who were able to see the enormity of the risk and bet against overarching market sentiment to earn billions. Overall, the book provides an engrossing, well researched and accessible summarization of the Financial Crisis. On a critical note, \\"The Big Short' by no means provides the entire picture and a reader might justifiably feel that discussion of Government involvement (The Fed, Treasury, SEC) is woefully thin, as is insight into the inner workings at Ratings Agencies and major US Financial Institutions. While limited access to credible sources in these areas likely explain the gaps, it does leave the reader with the sense of a somewhat one-sided re-telling, with a lot left to be said.<br /><br />MEMORABLE QUOTE from `The Big Short':  \\"Our model says they are worth seventy, replied one of the Deutsche Bank people.\\" \\"Well, our model says they are worth ninety-five, repeated the Morgan Stanley person\\". \\"At which point Greg Lippmann (Deutsche Bank Bond Trader) just said, Dude, fu3k your model. I'll make you a market. You have three choices; You can sell them back to me at seventy. You can buy some more at seventy-seven. Or you can give me my fu3king one point two billion dollars.\\"<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Much like an old western from the 70's, `The Big Short' is full of larger than life characters - prospectors, profiteers, conmen, preachers, bankers, sheriffs, government men, and general town-folk. The bloody shootout on main street leaves behind shot-up bodies (of bankrupted firms), the wounded (financially liable / weakened companies), collateral damage (everyday investors left with nothing), and those few who ride out of town with billions.  Saddle up, this is one hell of a ride.nks, illiquidity of the credit market and the subsequent catastrophic impact on the entire financial system.

B008YU0AOE|5.0|This program gives a standard calc in Portrait or a Scientific calc in Landscape view. It's great. for adults and students alike.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was my least favorite of the series. Some of the \\"stream of consciousness\\" style writing, especially when describing Katniss's thoughts when she was high on morphling, was kind of difficult to understand. I also was kind of disappointed with some of the decisions that Katniss made. I think that I idealized her and believed that she would make the best decisions, but to be fair, she was never really that way. Peeta was always the most moral character and I kind of expected Katniss to make decisions in the same way that Peeta would.<br /><br />Those complaints being raised, the author did a beautiful job with this book, just as with all the others. The unpredictability, the details that made the book seem like it could be fact instead of fiction, the gripping characters, the sacrifices and moral dilemmas all contributed to another engaging, thought-provoking read.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|But needs a little setup instruction. I am still not clear on all features but it does remind me of appointments and birthdays on my mobile device.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|As usual a great read, can't wait for the next installment of Scarpetta.  Patricia Cornwell never dissapoints with her stories.
B005LAIGNC|4.0|This is an excellent tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen of WW II, and it features some of the best aerial combat scenes in the history of cinema. But outside the cockpits, the story is a bit on the lame side, with some pretty cheesy cliched dialogue in places. George Lucas is responsible for the best part of this film...the CGI dogfights between the Tuskegee Airmen in their P-40s and P-51s and the German airmen in their ME-109s and Me 262s. The fact that some of the dogfight scenes are reminescent of &#34;Star Wars'&#34; battles between Rebel X-Wing and TIE fighters is evidence of Lucas' involvement. Cuba Gooding, Jr (who also was featured in HBO's &#34;Tuskegee Airmen&#34; and Terrence Howard (who played a Tuskegee Airman in &#34;Hart's War&#34;) deliver good performances, as do the other actors, most of whom are unknown to me, who portray the Tuskegee pilots. Although the plotline is based on history, the events in the film are largely fictionalized. This is a good film and an excellent tribute; but we need a better, more fact based film to commemorate this evolutionary chapter in American history...and to better honor the black airmen who trained at Tuskegee.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Good story but the jumping around in past then back to present made it hard to keep up.  The ending was a surprise I didn't see coming.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|\\"Brutal, yet captivating\\" - is the tagline summary on the Rotten Tomatoes site, which gives this film a 71% positive rating. And that about sums it up for me too...it is a brutal story on a couple of levels. First, the brutality associated with the Vanger family of industrialists in Sweden, headed up by patriarch, Henric (Christopher Plummer) who may be the only sympathetic character in the bunch. Henric hires Mikael Blomkvist, (Daniel Craig) a down and out investigative journalist, ostensibly to write a biography of Henric; but actually to investigate the disappearance of his grandniece Harriet, some 40 years earlier. To assist in the investigation, Mikael hires Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) an unusual researcher and computer hacker. A secondary brutal aspect of the film involves the loutish treatment - including rape - of Lizbeth by her court appointed guardian. Martin (Skellan Skarsgard) the brother of the missing grandniece, is another primary character. While the overall casting is near perfect, the most powerful performance is by Rooney Mara as Lizbeth...if you have seen Mara in other films, you know how beautiful she is, and it is a shock seeing her for the first time in this film...a shock that never completely wears off. And her performance is phenomenal...she certainly deserved her Oscar nomination.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|One more cool game from Imangi...! We are loving this game..! Entertainment unlimited and addicted to this game..! Keep it up!!
B005LAIGZU|4.0|Incredibly well done. When people rave about this film, they always talk about the heroic nature of the people who do this job. But on a technical level, the way it is shot and edited give it the heartbeat that excites the audience.  Think about the courage of men who are dropped among hostiles, but also think of the courage of people gathering information on the ground without any protection, or those who link up the pieces of intel that make this work, and the tax paying dollars necessary to equip and train these people to do the job they do. They can't do it alone, and the people who stay behind to hold everything else together, keeps it together - as they say, if you don't button everything up before you leave, you will hurt the operation and the men who depend on you. The production was incredible. The casting excellent and if you've ever been around these people, the dialogue is sometimes as corny as real life. Well done.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A great story from the first word to the last! Outstanding! I am so happy this is in my permanent library!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Michael Caine is Scrooge in this adaptation and he is wonderful; but be forewarned, this is not a traditional rendering of the Dickens' classic.  Most of the characters are Muppets of course and there is plenty of comedy to go along w/the serious tale about an old and surly businessman, who finds the spirit of Christmas.  It is also a musical, and some of the songs are memorable...especially &#34;When Love is Gone&#34;.  Except for the music and the comedy, this adaptation pretty much follows the Dickens novel.  A delight to watch!!
B00AIGQTEC|2.0|Prince has always made great music.  When he is on he is on.  No one can touch him.  When he is off he releases this.. If you want old school prince funk get the Original 7's (the Time) last cd.  It was great.  This is funkless.
6305128952|5.0|This is an outstanding film adapted from an outstanding novel by Nicholas Evans. It works on multiple levels...first as a story about natural horsemanship techniques, or &#34;horse whispering&#34;, as practiced by Buck Brannaman, who was the technical advisor for the film. Second, it is the story of a family in disarray after a terrible accident results in Grace, the young daughter, and her horse, Pilgrim, being severely injured. This is - my opinion - Robert Redford's best performance behind the camera; and he delivers a fine performance as Tom Booker...even making the romance between him and the much younger, Kristin Scott Thomas, believable. Thomas, as Annie, delivers her usual excellent performance. Perhaps the best performance is by a 14 year old Scarlett Johansson. as Grace...a difficult role for a mature adult; she pulls it off w/aplomb.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|A story of how we can disconnect, and then find ourselves as again in journey called relationships.<br />Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones give heart-warming performances.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|I loved it and if anything, my wife liked it more than me. Based on a true story, a young married couple, Leo and Paige Collins, is involved in a horrendous traffic accident, with Paige going through the windshield and suffering brain damage. When she revives after an induced coma, she does not remember anything that has happened over the past five years. She recovers physically, and returns home with Leo...but he is a stranger, as are all their friends. The story is about the efforts by Leo to help his beloved wife, Paige, recover her memory of their life together.  Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum at their best.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Beautiful graphics and entertaining ancient geography and history lesson-all wrapped in an enjoyable, smooth playing game.  Enjoyable for all ages and for repeated play.
B000AP04NI|5.0|&#34;Oklahoma!&#34; was the first of the Rogers & Hammerstein musicals; and this film adaptation of the stage play is among the best ever movie musicals. I personally love all of the R&H film adaptations and won't quibble about ranking...they are all outstanding. &#34;Oklahoma!&#34;, as in most R&H musicals, epitomized the development of the &#34;book musical&#34;, where the songs and dances are fully integrated into the story, with serious drama that is intended to evoke emotions other than joy and laughter. For example, the plotline features a grim villain, Judd Fry (played superbly by Rod Steiger) who competes with Curly for the love of Laurey. Gordon MacRae is Curly and Jennifer Jones (in her film debut) is Laurey; and they are both in perfect pitch throughout this film. In addition look for outstanding performances from Gloria Grahame, as Ado Annie, &#34;the girl who can't say no.&#34; and the delightful character actor, Charlotte Greenwood as Laurey's Aunt Eller. Also look for Gene Nelson, who as Will Parker, demonstrates his talent as a dancer, in addition to his singing. If you're a fan of movie musical or of popular music, you will recognize the R&H standards and probably be able to sing right along with the cast...&#34;chicks and ducks and geese better scurry, when I take you out in the surrey..
B0067EKY7M|5.0|A charming story about a unusual premise.  I found the subtitles to be very helpful to fully understand what the characters were saying.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|This is the story of a magnificent, amazing and miraculous horse. It is also a historical drama portraying some of the most horrifying aspects of The Great War (WW I) as seen through the horse's eyes. It is adapted from a childrens' novel written by the excellent author of childrens' literature, Michael Morpurgo. To those who believe the plot is too simplistic, sappy or childish and the animals too anthropomorphic, well HELLO...remember the original target audience. That does not mean this movie is for children only...in fact, since it depicts some rather gruesome aspects of war, judgement should be used in taking children to see it. Except for the very young, it should appeal to all age groups. As with most Spielberg films the cinematography is outstanding...especially the scenery shot in Devon which is absolutely breathtaking. The John Williams soundtrack too, perfectly sets the mood for the story. The casting, both human and animal, is spot-on. Jeremy Irvine, in his film debut, was an excellent selection to play Albert Naricott, the original owner and trainer of Joey, a beautiful chestnut stallion. You will marvel, I know I did, that horse cavalry was still used, at least in the early stages of WW I...against German machine guns.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really did like this app. It was fun to play, and the graphics were fabulous. And it's free~! How much more could one want in an app?
B0068FYZIO|5.0|This is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece in my opinion.  Based on a true story of a businessman/war profiteer, Oskar Schindler, (played superbly by Liam Neeson) who develops an  empathy for the Jews he employs in his business located in Poland and leverages a plan to save them.  It also has one of the best characterizations of a sadistic, psychopathic SS officer ever put on film - Amon Goth, played superbly by Ralph Fiennes.  One of the top 25 films ever made...my opinion.
B000B589JI|5.0|So much easier to carry this for a little extra fluid, so much easier to carry this over a whole can of lighter fluid
B00782O7NE|5.0|What an incredible treat for silent movie fans, and what a great introduction to the medium for those who've never watched a silent movie. The director, writers and actors obviously love the genre, and they do it proud - loved every minute of this movie. And Uggy - even if the rest of the movie was only mediocre, it would be worth seeing just for the charm and charisma of the dog. Wonderful film!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Interesting concept to combine OK and NK in the same book.  However it fell short in character development and in creating a believable plot structure.  Still an interesting read.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This movie portrays a compelling story with some top-drawer acting by fresh-faced Jennifer Lawrence in the lead, and excellent fresh-faced support among her fellow &#34;Tributes&#34;, especially by Josh Hutcherson. There is also excellent support from the veteran cast who play the government and gaming officials of the fictional country of Panem...with standout performances by Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland. The CGI special effects are visually stunning as is the cinematography from the mountains of Western North Carolina. Gary Ross does well behind the camera too
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Grandson loves it.  He plays everyday,  he says it's kind of hard to earn gems. I woul l,recommend this for any child and adults too.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The third biggest grossing film of all time, not only was this a huge box office hit, it was also critically acclaimed. We've seen Marvel films featuring the individual superheroes, Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, and Hawkeye. Here in one movie they are all assembled to fight Loki, the rogue half-brother of Thor and his army of extraterrestrials, known as the Chitauri. The film has stunning CGI visuals, which have almost become routine in superhero films...but this effort manages to take CGI visuals to another level. Joss Whedon does a fine job behind the camera in crafting and coordinating a complex melange of super heroes and their various sci/fi apparati. He also scripted the film, so he gets double credit for it's excellence.
1608871517|5.0|I can't express in mere words the wonder and magic that this book has.  This is a treasure.  When you read it, you can feel Michael is reading with you.  He's beside you while looking at all the beautifful photos of the manifestation of his God-given genius and art, as well as Bush's and Tompkins' God-given gifts providentially willed to be Michael's designers, clothing engineers and dressers.<br /><br />Bush had just published a book Michael truly deserves.  Michael is smiling from above.  I know that God is very happy for what Michael Bush did.  Bush is such a great, pure, fun soul like Michael was.  They were meant to work together.<br /><br />I'm wordless to describe it more.  Buy and read it.<br /><br />BEST Michael books (in order, 1 being the best):<br /><br />1.  Moonwalk<br />2.  Dancing the Dream<br />3.  The King of Style: Dressing Michael Jackson<br />4.  Michael Jackson Conspiracy<br />5.  Redemption<br /><br />These 5 books are all A MUST.
B0097GTUCC|3.0|I really wanted to like this album.  I am a great fan of Barrett Martin's drumming and as usual he doesn't dissappoint.  As a whole the music is solid, helped out by notable guests such as Mike McCready and Duff McKagen.  I was unfamiliar with Jeff Angell and have no complaints about his guitar playing but am not sure about his singing--his enunciations/pronunciations of certain words are a little bizarre.  It is also obvious that neither he nor Barrett Martin are lyricists; I won't get into specifics on a song by song basis but the lyrics are weak as a whole and if they are planning a follow-up album this is one area they might want to draft in some help.
B008476HBM|5.0|An out-of-this world experience, especially for the missus who had studied the hard copy at school in her teens.  Today is the 200th anniversary to the day of this novel first being published in the UK, so this review comes with all the stars it duly deserves.  Congratulations for making it possible with modern technology.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|That's right. In my opinion, it is the smartest, wittiest, most fun show on tv and there is nary a hot chick in it, ok for a second. :) Seriously, if you like mystery and adventure, this is your show period. I will watch this over pretty much any movie. Both of these guys are going to be big stars if they aren't already. What a casting job and level of writing. It's tv for the educated.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I never review anything, but this DVD has inspired me. My roommate and I are of average weight, but we've been putting on some fluff due to a spotty workout regime over the past few years. I got this DVD on a whim because it was a suggested item when I purchased some weights and at $8 I figured why not. We started this DVD two days ago and immediately we were feeling the burn. It's day 3 and we are both so sore that moving is a chore, but we feel AMAZING. My energy is back again and I feel more awake and focused than I have in a while. It may only be day three, but just based off of how sore I am, I know the results are going to be amazing. I can't wait to get a few more of her DVDs now so we can keep going even after these 30 days are up. Jillian's attitude and the way she breaks down everything you're doing and the reasons behind it encourage you to keep up with this workout. I haven't been in this much pain in a long time, but I still can't wait for my workout every day, Jillian makes it fun and keeps you motivated! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to lose a bit of weight and get some real muscle tone at the same time!
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|Giving one less star because sometimes loses connection and sometimes doesn't work is device is locked. Sometimes is not able to connect to mt TV
B00B19DMUE|4.0|It does what a horror movie should.. scare you, be suspenseful , make you care what happens, and have great special effects!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me from the first page!! It's definitely worth reading, I could not put it down! It's one of those rare finds: most books these days have sequels or are trilogy's, but this one was well written and had twists and turns to keep you turning the page for more. I love that its a stand alone book and even though I would love to read more about the characters, it had a satisfying ending which was great!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This was one of the best Historical books I've read in a long time. Ms Goodwin wrote a very readable book on one of our best known Presidents. She gave a very complete picture of Lincoln. If you think you know Lincoln read this book and you will come away with a renewed appreciation for our 16th President. There is something for most everyone to enjoy. Family man, lawyer, politician, statesman, and victim. Lincoln and the men he surrounded himself with make for good reading.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Sigh... English accents, period costumes, real-life castles, true love, self-sacrificing heroes, shocking scandals, characters you love to love, and characters you love to hate. What more could you possibly want in a show?  I was going to wait until Season 3 came out on Prime free video, but I just couldn't wait and bought the episode. It did not disappoint.
1843106698|5.0|This book was a major instigator of realization and explanation of the challenges I experienced in life as a result of learning that the traits he mentioned match a lot with those that plagued me when young and to an extent still do. Too bad I did not know about this book earlier as I am now a month short of 60 and recently retired and the knowledge would have changed the way I dealt with life's challenges for Aspies.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I am loving the new Temple Run! It's still a bit buggy, especially when it forces close sometimes when I use a gem to save myself, but it's so much fun! I wouldn't mind a few more objectives, but I'm hooked just the same!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of Heaven.I was impressed that it was written by doctor who did not believe in spritual things. Very persuasive.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Love that book! Smart, funny and very interesting! If you want to read something new about building your own buisness this book is MUST HAVE!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Great buy! I would totally recommend Teen Wolf: Complete First Season. Watching the show on MTV made me interested in this purchase. :)
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I hate the fact that George R. R. Martin writes such a thrilling story that you are forced to read all of the books non-stop... Simply amazing.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a nice read from acclaimed author Nicholas Sparks. The nice thing about this book is that it nicely paced and allows you to get to know the character of Katie while gradually introducing the conflict of this novel. I would definitely recommend it as a feel good Valentine's Day read with an unexpected, yet pleasant, ending!
B0058SNIC6|2.0|I wanted to like these. They are too narrow for my wide foot and they make an awful sound when you walk in them. I was hoping to wear them to work (I teach) but that's not going to happen. Fit is ok except for my smallest toe and it feels awful on that toe. I wish you could get wider crocs.
B000003BZ4|4.0|If you like the blues Gov't Mule is for you. Warren Haynes vocals and guitar work are first rate. Good CD.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Great ensemble acting. Good story. It is filmed in beautiful India, Almost like a vacation. Anytime you can watch Maggie Smith AND Judi Dench, go for it!!!!
B004ZGI1V0|2.0|The story lined had the necessary ingredients to be good, but it was very poorly executed. Go watch The Grey instead.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun, good for kids that love taking care of pets but doesn't have their own. Very good time killer.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was so exciting and funny!!!!!!!!!! It was the best book of the whole series and that is saying a lot
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Using the new multiple point of views really helps keep the series fresh.  This book has the same action and comedy as Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and the new characters are just as engaging as the original.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Another great book in the series. If you want an additcting series of books - this is it! Even if you watched the HBO series, still read the books - so good.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This series just keeps up the same high quality book after book.  It was nice having Percy back in the mix.
B009MF56GC|3.0|As I stated, it's a good movie bust as with almost all sequels it's not as good as the original.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Bonamassa brings 3 guests to this dvd. My favorite guest is Beth Hart. She tears it up. Her and Joe should do another cd.
B005LAII80|5.0|Just a short review, but I just gotta say right off the bat the biggest thing I thought was well done was the fact that Karl Urban made me forget it was Urban under the mask. The fact that the movie stayed true to the comics and never removed it or showed his face was perfect. I really enjoyed the movie and have watched it many times. I really hope they continue this and bring back Olivia Thirlby's character in some form. Ma-Ma was perfectly played Lena Headey. Anyway, not gonna go on about how awesome the movie was. Other people have already said it many times.<br />If you haven't seen it and enjoy bloody action movies, give it a go.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is up there with some of the best books I have ever read.  It took me a few pages to figure out the layout - yeah I'm slow.  But after that, this book had me! About half way through - I honestly couldn't put it down!  The story just grabbed a hold of me.
B005H29GSI|4.0|I try to keep the kids playing with others versus becoming reclusive playing single player games. They both love angry birds so this is a great way to get them to play it together and not kill my battery on the phone. Too bad it's not as easily taken on trips. I did find a small bag that I put everything in but the parts are flimsy so care needs to be taken as to where it's stored.<br /><br />It's quite the pain to get the TNT box to explode but the kids are getting better at it, maybe it just needs to get worked a bit to wear it in right.<br />Cards are used to establish how things get setup and how many points you can get for each piece and so on. It's a pretty good system.<br />Ice blocks fit together and you get points for separating the halves.<br /><br />overall they are happy playing it and I'm happy I don't have a head battery all the time.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was an wonderful book. I would highly recommend it. A colorful representation of the south, presented in an interesting way. Some parts were tough to take, but in all it was a great story.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's a game of solitaire.  It passes the time when I don't have a book to read on the train.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Excellent Zombie movie, neat idea with the &#34;rule&#34; system. Not really for kids though. Woody Harrelson is pretty darn funny. So Nut up or shut up.
B0076DELIG|4.0|This is a typical Harry Bosch story - the ending had a bit of a twist - which I always enjoy
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This was a real page turner. It was one of those rare books which i couldn't put down and at the same time, i didn't want it to end and so I'd force myself to slow down and pause every now and then. My only criticism was the ending. I didnt like it at all. It didnt make sense after everything that had happened for the story to end like Gillian Flyn chose to end it!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I like mystery stories ... I had ready The Lion and had forgotten about all the little side comments the main character makes throughout the book that at times detract from the book.
0783230079|5.0|This is one of the most heartwarming yet funny movies to this date, in my opinion.<br />I have seen this movie in the past and loved it.  Two of my favorite stars Tom Sizemore and Robert Downey Jr. star in it and also one of my favorite actress's in Alfre Woodard.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.<br />  Thanks!!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I would not buy this book in Kindle version as you need to  keep going back to find names that seem important but are mentioned very few times in the  begining.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I bought them for tailgating at night games.  They have a hook on the bottom and you can remove the plastic housing to expose the bulb.  It gives light in all directions when removed. I hang them from the Easy-Up frame so you can see what your grilling.<br />They are bright enough to light my 15 x 18 living room.  Two brightness settings and a flash mode for emergency road hazard I guess.  Also has an small green LED that blinks when the batteries are installed.  Makes it easy to find in the dark.<br />These lamps far exceeded my expectations.  Bought two more for my mother-in-law for power outages.
B0015DROBO|5.0|What a writer . . . amazing.  You could just read this first book but I am sure glad I read teh next two of the trilogy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I like this book because it's intriguing has an awesome story line. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good love story or to anyone who is in the mood for a book with a dark twist.

B009VB97EY|4.0|Laid back comedy with a sweet twist. Definitely a chick-flick though. I'd recommend it for a girls night in movie.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I am very satisfied with this purchase. The first case I received didn't fit exactly right. I sent it back and had it exchanged and now it's perfect! Thanks!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|My husband & I loved all the Bourne movies & we really wanted to see this one too. It wasn't as good as the first ones but they never are. It was still worth seeing & I'm sure we'll add it to our Bourne collection.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Looking forward to future episodes, a nail bitter - literally! Wish it was included in prime purchases though, it was a bit expensive.
B00AFWEPVI|2.0|If you want to take pictures with the Fire, you have to make sure you hold it just so. The camera &#34;lens&#34; is on the same side as the screen, and its difficult to really get a good picture. No flash, so make sure you have good lighting!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I found Gone Girl to be a great read. Very captivating although i was a little disappointed with the final twist in the book
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing book!!!!! At times it talked about some pretty heavy content but I couldn't put it down!! Anyone who needs a good drama pick this book!!!!!
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|I found this book to be quite entertaining. The subject was a little dark, as we're a few of the scenes. I
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It's not really the way crapy version of MINECRAFT but it was a smallish time still I build a good mansion in 20 secs
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Page turning adventure keeps you reading long after you should have gone to bed.<br />John Corey character is funny as usual and this time has some witty charaters to bank off his remarks.<br />Satisfying read.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I love it, amazing graphics. I didn't hink it would mess up on MY kindle but it wouldnt even come up! I deleted almost EVERYHING to prevent lags and mess-ups! Fix things for Kindle Fire!! Recommended for androids and other stuff, but needs improvement before it can be passed off as a legitimately bug-free kindle game!!
B001D8W7CW|5.0|Wonderful movie. I reviewed the book so I have no more to add to the story depicted in the movie. Unlike a lot of movies based on books, this movie was faithful to the book. (Stanley Kubrik's &#34;The Shining&#34; should have been named, &#34;Stanley Kubrik's The Shining to differentiate it from the book.)  Although the &#34;Carrie&#34; the book goes into character development much more deeply than the movie was able, the acting was very good. Sissy Spacek was incredible. The way the relationship between her and her fanatic, fundamentalist mother unfolded said as much in a few moments as some of the sometimes lengthy side trips through which King takes you on the journey in this horribly fantastic movie. John Travolta looked like a teenager, his character was shallow, and stupid. Carrie was filmed in 1976 and John Travolta would have been 22, so maybe he was playing himself. There's much more that can be said for this film, but it is enough to highly recommend the movie and the book.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|The series is good. Brings to life some interesting aspects of the book. Super impressed with the packaging, I showed it off to all of my friends that are fans of the series.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I like Nicholas Sparks novel but they can occasionally become to sappy.<br />This novel is a little different as he added an element of suspense tot he story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app may be free, but it is so addictive. It is also easy, fun and like I said addictive to play. I would and have told family an friends to download and play. I Know they will have just as much fun as I.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I absolutely love Gossip Girl!! I'm deeply sad about the series being over. I wish they would reconsider making a 7th season!!
B00826CI54|2.0|It's a great film, and the 3-D was pretty good, but the image suffered from ghosting. In other words, both of the stereo images were visible, one ghosted in the background of the other, which limited the 3-D somewhat.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved the concept of the book's point of view as an interview.  Reminded me of the original Dracula as told through<br />letters.  Much action.  Unique idea.
0765325950|3.0|From 1990 to 2013 this series has held us all captive. It has finally come to an end. Sadly, the last book was a bit of a disappointment. It wasn't that the plot wasn't good, it was. It wasn't that Sanderson wasn't a good author, he was. The problem, I feel, is that Jordan created too many plot threads. Sanderson tried his best to wrap them all up to completion with little bows. Unfortunately, having to close so many stories, for instance Padan Fain's yarn coming to completion in just a few short pages after having not been mentioned for quite some time, just left the last book feeling disjointed. I place most of the blame upon Jordan and Tor for allowing this series to get out of control in the first place. Seriously, this could have been done much better in four, maybe five books. Better editing, people. The wheel of time is the reason why I will never again begin a series before it is completed in its entirety. Good riddance.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|GUYS SO SO SO SCARY NOT FOR THE FAINT AT HEART THAT GAME MADE ME LAUGH MY HEAD OFF IN TERROR. It's not too scary, but it definitely scared me to the point where I didn't know what to do with myself.
0525952926|4.0|Winter of the World: Book Two of the Century Trilogy<br /><br />This book, interesting from an historical perspective, just misses 5 stars because of Follett's using improbable character connections.  One character meets another too many times. Coincidence is allowed, but not over and over again.  It's simply not believable.  Otherwise the novel accurately portrays historical events.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome book read it cover to cover and it was amazing hope you enjoy it too by the way it talks about Valentine's day and chicken pox
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|foul language , story line just stupid, don't waste your time or money, you'll be more entertained watching a PBS show..
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a funny book. I think everyone buy this books. I was dying to get the book. Bravo Jeff Kinney.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hated to come to the end of the trilogy.  The story is addictive.  Sometimes I have to fight a book just to finish but I gobbled the Hunger Games up!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Deleterious.Excellent to twist the character of young people.Reminds L'Histoire d'O and Les Liaisons Dangereuses as far as moral background is concerned
0425263908|5.0|It was an amazing book.<br />A great love story and exactly like 50 shades of grey.<br />If you liked that book, you'll definitely love this one.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|I had watched a lot of videos/documentaries on Gerson Therapy. This book meets my expectations. I highly recommend it. I have been on juicing for last 6 weeks and feel great. I've lost 6 lbs, lots of energy, my BP went from 140/110 to 115/70 while being off of medication. I can't wait to get off my allergy medicine soon.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an amazing book. Such a fast read as well. Can't wait for the movie to come out next month
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Not for everyone, but beautifully written.  I'm not a hiker, and don't plan to become one but I loved this book.
B008MM9630|4.0|Really love it! Love the challenges as well as the mini challenges. I would definitely recommend this game to all!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is even better than the addictive and challenging temple run 1. The developers have added new twists and challenges so that now temple run 1, which is a challenge, seems like the  \\"bunny hill\\" or practice slope for the mountain that is Temple Run 2. It is truly the next step up for temple lovers and not just more of the same just with new wallpaper. I will look forward to when we see Run 3...if it is the next step up as this one is, we will be on a black diamond slope playing that one. There is a bug that needs to be fixed. Sometimes when you try to pick up the \\"save me\\" gem, the game crashes and has to be reopened, but the score and coins are still there when it reopens. I'm sure it will be worked out on an update very soon.  I suggest using a medium quality picture on the kindle fire. The best quality can't keep up the intense and always changing  grahics well enough when you get into the millions and it will hinder you later to be sure.  Be prepared to spend  hours and hours of enjoyment mastering  and maybe yelling at this app. but it's all part of the fun.  It isn't worth beating the game if it comes too easily, right? I have not mastered it yet...but I got my boss hooked on this game and I can kick his tail every time. ( I am not suggesting that you irritate your boss as much as I like to.)
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|This C.D. was AMAZING!!!!!! Y'ALL SHOULD ALL BUY IT! It was so good! I listen to it all the time
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Watched the movie with my 7 year old and I forget it was PG-13. The aliens featured was fun to watch but the violence was high alone with a fair amount of profanity<br />Buyer beware of child's age
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This temple run us much better than the first one. It is better because the graphics are better also the music is better and the monster is even scarier!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Don't let the overplay of diamonds steer you away from this amazing album. Jump is an incredible song with some dubstep remixing in it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's way better then any other game, know that they made Temple Run 2  I barely ever play Temple Run anymore
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Well didn't realize there was another one after this one; still love the Percy Jackson books; great history; great fun; GREAT read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Imangi finally produces a game with some replay value.  (TR 1 was weak) This is my second favorite game.  You have to try Subway Surfers, blows TR2 away!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is probably one of the cutest books I've read in a long time; heart wrenching and funny at the same time.  All told from a dog's view.  What a winner!
B009AMAMF2|5.0|I am an older movie goer, in my early 60s.  I grew up watching b&w tv on only 3 channels.  I am probably not the target audience for Cloud Atlas, but I think it is a great film.  I will watch it several times, once the Blu-ray price drops, even though it is over two and a half hours long.  It is the \\"fastest\\" long movie I have ever watched.  The real star is the editing together of the various stories--truly marvelous.  I should admit I am a big fan of artful editing.  Pulp Fiction, Lone Star, and Memento are among my favorite films.  I am not a big fan of Tom Hanks, but he is brilliant in each of the roles he inhabits here.  You could appreciate this film just by watching him closely.  I highly recommend Cloud Atlas.  Not everyone will like it, but it deserves a greater audience than it found in the theater.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this os the best horse game<br />: ) ;) I love the game so much iloveyou horseie they are my live delly one s
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Bought this book based upon the star rating. Apparently I read a different book than those who gave it 4-5 stars..never could get use to the many Indian references.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has so much more than the first one. And the graphics on TR2 is a huge step up. This is a job well done for Imangi Studios LLC.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|This is an app that's a little different from the others.  It was a little weird at first, but I actually started to like it.  It holds my attention.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Guess what I had 57 acorns and they took 40 of my acorns today and acorns are hard to get.This really is stinking.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like the different sounds that are available.  There are a ton of them.  This app is great.  I have Nature Sounds as well and it doesn't have the variety of Relax Melodies.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It's very fun but is short for the demo and takes a very long time to load, but I'm going to buy the full version!
B002OSY2T6|5.0|I bought this toy for my infant grandson. I wanted to get him a toy that would assist him in &#34;tummy&#34; time. Its something that he likes to look up to while on his tummy. This encourages him to strengthen his head and neck mucles up. He loves the mirrior and it lights up.  It can be used as he gets older as it can move along the floor and he can crawl or  chase over it. I highly recommend this to anyone. I love toys that can be used in infancy and then still used up to toddler ages like this toy.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book enjoyed reading it  I think it was the best diary of a wimpy kid books you should make another one
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I loved all the harry potter films and books.  It's a great collection to have, to enjoy by yourself or with family and friends.
0307279189|5.0|great book; very inspirational to read and really gets you wanting to run and become a healthier version of yourself
B001F12J0C|4.0|It's usually hard to find a good set of movies in a trilogy.  But the bourne trilogy is it.  Each movie provides a good combination of action, mystery, and all around entertainment.  I know the fourth movie isn't up to par for most people, but this collection of the original three is a good buy.
B00AQMSJI2|1.0|I liked this game however what they don't tell you is the money you earn they take it I played this game several times a day and never really bought anything so why did my money keep decreasing hmm I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is one app you would want to have on your kindle if you want to know about battery health. this app also provides info and useful stats on various programs using your device.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved the first temple run but I love the second one better.It has more challenges and is overall better.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love the way that he loves her and the happy ending. People need to read this book without preconceptions and allow yourself to enjoy the story.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Cute game!  It is really close to the real thing!  It can be very frustrating and it makes you want to move your device to make the coins fall!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book's not to stop reading, do not wait to read the next book. I love the way they like each other.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter found this game and put it on my Kindle for me.  Didn't know if I would like it at first, but after trying iit I became hooked!!
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|As always the story is engaging and captivating. I enjoyed every page. I cant wait for the next book. very nice.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game!!  It is very addicting!!  It sometimes makes me almost dizzy when the cube turns in a weird direction, but it is fun!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|book well written, exciting and sexy story. I loved the characters. I loved the book. The book makes us want to continue and continue reading.
1594481717|5.0|It's a book, what else is there to say.  I hate to read and I don't like books that involve reading,,,bllaaahhhhh......
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I loved the Arnold Schwarzenegger version (although did not especially enjoy him as governor of my state). Not sure why they bothered to do a remake -- it was all computerized action scenes that I find boring and hard to follow, with the characters taking and shaking off blows that should have killed them as if they were cartoon characters, a plot that made no sense (going through the core of the earth? It's hot in there!) (and no one ever before thinking about blowing up the tunnel if it could be blown up that easily?), and poor character development. I ended up feeling as if I had been duped by the $4.99 rental.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game. Just one thing. Can not wait till update comes. Buy it I promise that you will like it and if you do not play a different game like piece of crap block story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Can be one of the best games I've ever played! Better than both temple run games. New zip line, power up, and characters.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I only caught glimpses of this show when it aired.  I have watched the feature length ending a number of times, but seeing the whole thing in one go was spectacular.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This movie deserved every award and nomination. Lawrence's performance was amazing--she's has the chops to be the next Meryl Streep.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was a page turner right up to the last chapter.  I love Flynn's writing style.  Everything from the characters to the plot line was well developed and presented.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was a little bit on the scientific side, but understandable considering Dr. Alexander's profession.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I was home alone and looking for a light movie that would be entertaining for a couple of hours to just relax and not think about much.  This movie sufficed.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a good game, I am only at an early stage and already I agree with the general opinion that the invest points are tedious and overdone. Also I don't want to post everything I do, including every game I play on Facebook.
0765325950|5.0|T've been reading this series from Book One.  Even though some of the books were quite difficult to get through, that was not the case with this book.  It neatly wrapped up the story lines & brought back some characters from previous books -- a fact I thoroughly enjoyed.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I really like this case - it is a high-quality, durable product that dresses up my kindle instead of making it look tacky.  Very pleased.
B005LCECU6|5.0|While rush has many live offerings, this has something none of the others have. Three songs(2 original, 1 live)that are not on any rush albums. For that alone, this is worth it! And the live show itself is a great example of early rush! A must for hard core rush fans.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This Movie is awesome and great,it's fun to watch and I Love it.I really like this movie because it's very cute and it's got fun characters in this movie.the songs are awesome and I really love this movie.
B008XG1X18|4.0|You can do virtually everything with this app that you can do on a desktop or laptop. I miss the option of a &#34;pin it&#34; button for the Fire. But for simply scrolling about a repinning stuff, it's great.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Cyborg or Razer can't compete with Logitech when it come to keypads.<br /><br />It's heavy duty, intuitive and the LCD screen is AWESOME.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Rosalind Russel is amazing in everything she touches! DO NOT waste your time on the remake of this movie. This is the best!
B005LAIIKI|3.0|I am not sure why so many people are reaving about this film as if it is the masterpiece to end of masterpieces.  It is a fair film (lower end of the spectrum) at best.  It is a cross between a spaghetti-western and a 70s exploitation film.  Okay, lets start with the bad and work our way to the good.  Tarantino's trademark is trying for \\"shock value\\" in films and, the truth is, this style is way past its prime.  Sure it worked in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but how about trying something new?  This film could have had WAY more impact had he not required the actors to drop the N-bomb so many times.  Sure, it is relevant to the time period, but WE GET IT! How about moving on with the story and stop bashing us over the head with it?  Next, the plot and story line was so predictable that it was sad.  Did anyone see anything stellar or new here?  There is better story-telling on prime time TV than in this movie (admitting that made me just a little sick to my stomach).  As a matter of fact, the theme and plot of the story is the same as for every 80s video game: We are off to save the princess!  Really?  This is the best Tarantino can come up with?  Hell, even Mario Bros did it better (I'm sorry Mario, but the princess is in another castle).  Next, all the raving about the \\"massive violence\\" is misplaced.  Where was this violence? Again, you can see more graphic stuff on NETWORK TV.  If you are going to push the envelope, then push the envelope! CSI is worse/grittier than this film (as far as violence goes). Lastly, (at least for this review) making fun of the KKK (who certainly deserve to be made fun of) has already been done FAR better in the film Oh Brother, Where Art Thou.  This was a total rip-off of that scene.  Again, how about having an original idea, Tarantino?<br /><br />Okay, now on to the good.  Jamie Foxx was BRILLIANT in this film.  His acting was a masterpiece to witness and will keep the viewer riveted (and luckily overlooking the rampant flaws withthe rest of the film).  Sam Jackson...well, what can I say?  Another brilliant actor.  Need I say more?  The portrayal of Dr Shultz was a fine piece of work in this mishmash of a film.  Overall, it is easy to see how the individual actors saved a substandard film and apparently did such a good job that many other reviewers are overlooking the overall failure of this film.  The absolute best part of this film is the development of the relationship between Shultz and Django.  This is the real story of the film.  This is the ONLY story worth remembering from this film.  By the time the film came to an end, I felt my time was wasted with so much superfluous nonsense.  Funny, that is just how DiCaprio's character felt (but I am not going to spoil this film for those who have not seen it yet).  Is this film Tarantino's worst?  No.  Is it his best?  No.  Is it a middle of the road western that has already been done by far better directors?  I am afraid so.

B003F1WM2K|5.0|I gave Just Kids 5 stars because it is well written/it gives a clear  & tender picture of Patti Smith's relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe/she was his muse & he was her soul mate/Patti reveals the creative renaissance that was NYC in the 60s & early 70s/the confluence of writers, musicians, artists was wide & deep/I'd recommend this to any fan of Patti's & to anyone interested in the 60s arts scene &/or 60s life in NYC
B008XG1X18|5.0|i'm new to the world of Pinning, but so far its so fun! i love that i can collect all these pretty pictures of places to visit, lots of inspiration for craft projects, recipes, travle and more!
B009SSGBOE|5.0|For anyone that is a Donald Fagen/ Steele Dan fan.  This is a must buy!!!! It is classic in the sense that:<br /><br />1.  Every song has that classic Donald Fagen sound, while adding some completely new grooves, mainly a cover from Isaac Hayes, You won't be disappointed<br />2.  As usual the level of musicianship is stellar, and the quality of producing is as usual Grammy level, even though he went with a different coproducer this time.<br />3.  Incredible horn arrangements and some nice trumpet solos through out<br />4.  I am usually pleased when I buy a new CD from someone and there are three or four songs on the CD that I really like, but this CD pretty much every song is great!<br /><br />This was definitely worth the wait, and worth every penny I spent.  Enjoy...
B005XLN97M|4.0|I am actually really impressed by the Barbie beach house. I think it is built really well and has all Barbie's necessities (bedroom, bathroom, living room, stairs, eating area, front door) It has all the \\"needs\\" of a fun dollhouse without the extra cost and bulk. While the back is cardboard and its make of plastic it is actually pretty darn durable. I do agree with the other reviews that the \\"fridge\\" door falls of sometimes, but it's only happened a couple times for us and not that big of a deal. They did a nice job designing this house as there is so much in such a small space! I love that it doesn't fold up - any Barbie house we've had that folds up just gets forgotten about. I have never had any of the supports fall out/apart nor any of the stairs fall off. We have owned this for nearly a year. One small room partition thing has fallen off but it's not really needed anyway. Honestly this house has everything some of the larger dollhouses have at a fraction of the price and size.... so while I'm considering \\"upgrading\\" I'm not sure its necessary! I think the 3 story dream townhouse looks neat, but I wonder how its durability compares to this one - and is it worth the extra cost? There are lots of reviews complaining about the various plastic dollhouses but I really like their articulation, details, and accessories.... those are the things that make Barbie fun!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I really loved this book.  The writing was wonderfully descriptive and so whimsical it was almost poetic.  I could easily picture myself at the circus, hearing the sounds and smelling the scents.
B008H5J510|5.0|Es super mega extra incrible.  No me arrepiento de nada, me encanto.  Ademas esta a un buen precio para todo lo que tiene.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|Arrived sooner then expected.  New movie with a great story about the Tuskegee Airman.  Blu-ray is the way to go.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Israels music is the essence of the aloha spirit.His voice is distinct as it is beautiful. he does beautiful renditions of over the rainbow and It's a Wonderful Life. the heavens above are filled with his angelic voice and we miss him dearly...mahalo
B007HACDLK|5.0|Otro de mis autores favoritos es Vince Flynn, he leido todos sus libros desde &#34;Transfer of Power&#34;, Mitch Rapp es un personaje unico, en cada libro nuevo se supera, espero seguir leyendo sus proximas aventuras.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Loved it. Watched it twice as rental. Should have bought it. Love the music. Do not  know why it got such bad reviews.
B00966TN1Q|5.0|He leido todos los libros donde aparece el detectivie Harry Bosch desde The Black Echo, Michael Connelly es mi autor favorito, espero seguir leyendo sus libros
B0083P1QUM|3.0|The Bone Bed is the latest in Cornwell's Scarpetta series. While not a bad read, the character development is not her best. Difficult to get through at times and hard to stay on track with the story due to lack of developed characters. Despite this, Cornwell is still one of my favorites.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I play this on Kindle Fire.  It works great.  Tons of puzzles & challenges.  You don't run out of time playing, but you need to play fast to earn stars.  If you solve a game in the six minute range you earn 1 star, 5 minute range earns 2 stars & 4 minute range earns 3 stars.  I can replay a game over & over again & still not earn 3 stars.  It's a good challenge.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|hello all<br />first off let me say that if you are a person who cries at sad endings dont watch this you will cry and even if you are this person you may still cry the ending tugs at your heat strings<br /><br />Secondly this is an incredible movie from the action packed moments to the slow moments that lead the story along this is a movie that is for any action fan but also for both fans of the military and their family. The story of these navy seals does not slow down unless it talks about family but as it builds up you can feel the tension in the firefights, and from the insertions. you can see who and how things happen in the navy seal community and how these brothers in arms take care of themselves and their own but the best part is the moments where you see through the eyes of the operator these are tension filled moments fill the movie with a tension that you will enjoy. this is a great movie and i hope that this kind of collboration between the military and hollywood happens again
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Its a lot better than Temple Run!With cool new features like ziplineing.But 4 some reason after playing the game over and over... it won't let me play it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Loved every part of the book. Suspenseful, amazing, and awesome. Sucks you in like a whirlpool. Amazing. Ransom Riggs is my new favourite author.  Can't wait for the second book!!!!!
B009VB9VKY|2.0|wow what a piece of s***- wife wanted to watch it as we were scanning through the offerings on Roku. I was willing to check it out - we couldn't agree on anything else so this was the sole choice.<br /><br />No real plot, the characters weren't terribly compelling, acting... well anyways, I cant get that 1 hr 55 mins back. Save yourself and pass this one by
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Good movie to watch.  Better than the arnold one, more action and substance to this movie I would see it again
B004ZNAXX2|3.0|Having acquired the Wish You Were Here Immersion Box Set and satisfied with what it gave you, I was anxious for The Wall Immersion Set to be released. In the 1970's Pink Floyd was the only band to utilize the Quad format of audio at their live concerts, with the exception of a Gentle Giant show I attended that had sound coming from the rear of the theater every once in a while for a cool affect.<br />Anyway, I figured Pnk Floyd would get pretty creative on how they'd utilize the 5.1 sound on the CD, so I was dissappointed to hear that they didn't include a disc recorded in that format.<br />The other thing I was hoping to hear about in this set, which I've been looking for since The Wall was released, are the songs recorded without the talking and sound affects mixed in. When The Wall was first released and was being played all the time on the radio, I heard a version of Young Lust where at the end of the song there was no operator trying to connect a call to Mrs. Floyd. It was just a clean, uninterrupted version of the song until it ended. I want that! I should have called the radio station immediately back then, but I was just a kid. I didn't know it would turn into a 30 year quest.<br />Is anyone familiar with those recordings of that music?
0743496736|5.0|Book is in great condition.  Seems barely used, and it got here in just a few days.  As for the book, it is so far SO GOOD! Highly recommend reading it.
1401216676|4.0|I liked the killing joke because it was actually a book written by an illustrator, more or less...this goes into one of the jokers back story...although ppl will differ on his origin, the story plays well together with what evil comes along in this piece. Deluxe edition also includes sketches and how the book came to be...
B000002B30|5.0|My son-in-law is a huge fan.  Thought I should catch up.  Chose this one because I thought it had all the songs I know.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Works very well and is easy to use.  The only problem I had was trying to cut the neck of the bottles.  This took a little more thought and work.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|Will be going to a Bon Jovi concert this summer so I'm brushing up on the music.  He's so talented.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Had me guessing at every turn, and still completely surprised me! Recommended to some friends who loved it as well.  A must!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Elena and the Salvatore Brothers are at it again and I love to watch the series.  It doesn't exactly follow the book series but it is a series you can &#34;sink your teeth in&#34; time and again.  Looking forward to getting the 4th. season.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I read this because I loved Gone Girl so much.  This one lacked the magic of GG, but was still interesting and kept my attention.  Plus, it's a quick read.  Good for lazy days.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Dredd's a blast. It's a great popcorn action movie for an afternoon or evening at home. This new Judge Dredd movie is nothing like Stallone's 1995 movie. The story while not the strongest, and done many time over in movies like The Raid: Redemption, and New Jack City, works for this movies. The elements of special effects are worked into the story line giving them more meaning then just one more slow motion scene. The violence is not to campy and some of it has a very small bit of dark humor to soften it up.<br />  What I didn't like in the movie is the Movies big bad guy, or in this case Bad Girl. While she is as bad as up get, I think she could have used a little more fleshing out as she is one of the most unmemorable villains in any movie ever.<br /><br /> I rate the movie as a good time.
B003MC5N28|1.0|Not my kind of book! Without love, understanding, consideration. Its just like ur being told how to act & feel.
1616614609|5.0|Netrunner is one of the best card games ever. Fantasy Flight Games has given this old favorite a new life in their living card game line up. For gamers looking for a CCG without the insane cost to play it at a top level, this is the game to play.<br /><br />  The game is easy to pick up, but best learned when playing another person that knows the game. You can pick up the game in a few minutes and it can take weeks to master.<br /><br />  With new cards coming out monthly this game will have endless play-ability.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As always Mr. Clancy keeps you on the edge of your seat with multiple plots and non-stop action.  You cannot project ahead with possible outcomes as he will surprise you with something you did not expect.  I love his style!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I have not yet received the product, but have seen the movie and it was very enjoyable. I highly recommend it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Fell in love within the first pages. Interesting from the very beginning, then it really started to drag out. I understand he was a doctor, but maybe he should have took into consideration we all are not?
B0067R0APK|5.0|it does the job for me! I would reccomend it to someone else, that is for sure. hope ya'll enjoy
0345803493|3.0|A good read. But please do not try and go by this book. This is not a guide to go by.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is so nice having the longer cord to use when the battery is low on my Kindle Fire. Thanks
0345803507|3.0|A good read. But please do not try and go by this book. This is not a guide to go by.
0307266303|5.0|This book freaking rules.  I've read it multiple times and it never gets old.  I now eat chia seeds....I now eat beans with beer....I now enjoy running.  I will admit, however, after reading the book, I decided to take up barefoot running.  Don't run barefoot - I couldn't run for months afterward.  Enjoy the story, but keep your shoes on - at least that's my $.02.<br />This book is must read for any lazy SOB looking for a little motivation.<br />I recommend running in the previously purchased &#34;united we stand&#34; v-neck tee shirt.  People love it when they see that kinda stuff.

B000EHSN9Y|5.0|Unless you have been unlucky with a bad piece, or mis-information, i think this works to its expectations.<br />Apple as always! Only a little cheaper than @apple online store ;)
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great family entertainment and great moral!<br />My children and grandchildren all watched this &#34;Brave&#34; young,teenage, girl.<br />Laughed and everyone loved it when Mom turned in to a bear
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Absolutely love this game, I definitely recommend for horse lovers. Or really anyone looking for something fun and entertaining. This game was very well put together, and has astonishing graphics!
B000AOEMXM|4.0|I bought this four season set because I had enjoyed the first season (which I had watched online), and wanted to watch the entire series.  I knew it was a bit of a gamble, because shows often go downhill and fizzle out in their second season. But I had liked the first one enough I decided to take a chance.<br /><br />Having watched the entire series now,  my feeling is:<br /><br />1) the first season was by far the best.  It had a focused story arc, centering largely around the volatile relationship between humans and Vulcans, and their troubled history.  This gave the show interesting emotional undercurrents, gave an effective focus to Archer's relationship with his Vulcan science officer T'Pol, and provided a strong underlying theme that unified the episodes.  Most of the episodes in the first season were well written and reasonably well acted.<br /><br />2) The second season began sliding downhill.  It had a few good episodes, but also several bad and pointless ones.  It seemed to lose energy and direction after the first episode (which hurriedly resolved, then shelved, the interesting issues raised in the first issue finale about the temporal cold war). The series then floundered for a while while the writers seemed to struggle with where to go with the storylines, and how to inject drama and human conflict into a generally unfocused story arc.<br /><br />The second season also revealed an inherent flaw in the underlying logic and premise of the series: When Archer and his crew go out to \\"explore the Universe\\" in the first season, it's implied that they're the first humans to do so, because Vulcans have been holding back human space exploration for decades.  In this season we learn that there are human-run cargo ships tooling around at high warp in deep space, and apparently have been for decades. So cargo ships have been going out routinely \\"where no man has gone before\\" without the Vulcans objecting, but a general exploration ship has been unable to?  Ah, what?  If that's the case, it makes the early Star Fleet look naive and inept.  It's rather as if the starship Voyager had encountered random humans out picnicking in the Delta Quadrant, while on its several years mission to try to get back to earth, in the ST Voyager series a few years back.<br /><br />3) The third season was more fun and more tightly focused (to my mind) than the second. The stories were more tightly written and directed.  All in all, I liked season 3 much better than season 2.... until the really silly and stupid ending of the season finale, which set us up for some terrible episodes in season 4.<br /><br />4) I then watched the first five episodes of season 4, and found them almost unwatchable. The acting, writing and direction all slid downhill.  The acting became more cardboard, the stories silly, trite and predictable.  Then it turned around again, and the last several episodes showed marked improvement.  The \\"mirror darkly\\" episodes, dealing with the STE crew in an alternative universe, with alternative histories, was particularly fun.  The Terra Nova episodes again brought a good sense of focus and timing to the storylines.  The ending had some nice surprises, bringing back some characters from another Star Trek series.<br /><br />What to make of it all? Some good, some bad.... Some compelling, some unwatchable.  The good episodes were fun and memorable. The bad ones, I'm trying to forget.  All in all though, it had enough good episodes that if you're a fan of the other Star Trek series, it's likely you'll enjoy it.?

B008602KQI|5.0|It is so nice to have digital copies of movies now.  Amazon makes it very easy to purchase and watch on many devices.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|Boardwalk Empire is beautifully written and visually stunning.  It does a wonderful job of telling a compelling story during one of the most fascinating eras in American history.  The set design and wardrobe look spot on accurate for the time.  Casting for this show was one very well also. The performances by Steve Bucemi and Michael Pitt are masterful.  I highly recommend this show.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Of course it asks me to rate this thing as soon as I wake up.but I like how i wake up slowly.
B001OGLPZI|5.0|I do not normally listen to this type of music. It was suggested to be by a friend. As of now, it is on the playlist and something I recommend for other to explore.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very well written...just confirms lots of ideas I have entertained previously. Answers lots of questions regarding NDE that I have... anyone with questions should read.
0743496736|5.0|This book was highly recommended by a friend so I decided to buy it. Excellent gift to myself! Price was incredible, delivery was timely. Very pleased.  :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it so much I will die for it. So get it for your one good. So get it.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|This is the first time I read a book from Paulo coelho and I really liked it. I searched for the best books to read and this one was on all of the lists I found. I truly recommend this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great! Super fun, but it was glitching the other day. You should check that out. It's so addicting! I love to part with the cart. You should make that part longer.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|A classic feel good adventure you can watch again and again. Find the treasure and save the town, a simple plot with a great cast. You will be drawn in to the adventure and fun as if you were a  child again. Great movie for the young teens and young at heart.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is the best game ever.It is cooler and more addictive then Temple Run.I love this game.I wish I could play this all the time.It is very safe and you can play it anywhere!It is a great game for little kids and for adults!Trust me you will just fall in love with this awesome game!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I got this app and I personally think that it's awesome. If your bad at this game there a hint bitten you can press. I highly recommend this app
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I think this dictionary had a lot of really good facts that most dictionary don't have and I would recommend this book to everyone
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|The movie moved along well. Interesting. Alway like Bruce Willis. Interesting plot line. The ending was quite a suprise to me.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I'm not trying to do a complete review on this book.  I'm simply reporting on the quality of the book in Kindle format as well as commenting on some of the more negative views.<br /><br />I've read this book at least five times Since 1980.  The characters, pacing, and everything else are the best I've ever encountered.  So, I wanted a portable version and got this.  The digital version has few, if any, distracting white spaces due to having the type placed so that it spans the entire printed area (centered) rather than just hugging the left edge (left justified).  So, fantastic story, easy to read in Kindle format - even on my phone (Nexus 4) and completely portable.  Wonderful!<br /><br />I read a couple of the more negative reviews concerning this book, most having to do was the lack of historical accuracy.  The book is not a history, the book is fiction based on history and is as much story as it is fact.  If you're trying to read this book as a fact-filled history of Japan and specifically how the English finally penetrated the Spanish dominance, you're probably not going to be very satisfied.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a wonderful characters who grow and change during the story, this is the one for you. If you like to read James Michener, you'll like this book. Quite possibly you'll love it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great book, this made me buy the rest of the series, it is long, but the character development is awesome!
B002D0L0R2|5.0|Sometimes it's easy to get bogged down with all the bad news in the world.  This movie is a great escape.  I can't help but smile every time I watch it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love reading these books while i exercise on the elliptical.  I use my ipad to read about 2 chapeters a day.  Great books!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|He doesn't let you down in this new release. Buy it. You'll love it. The entire album is satisfying and worth the time!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|After three weeks with my case on my 4S, I am still pleased with it. I like how it looks and feels. My only complaint is that it takes some effort to get it on and off. It protects the phone well and shows off the iPhone design. I definitely recommend it.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|Normally, I don't get excited about alien invasion films. Mars Attacks is a different story. This is Tim Burton at his finest. His genius pays homage to all of the great sci-fi movies of the 50's and 60's while having fun with all the special effects mainstream film money can buy. The cast is fantastic. Some people have said that there are too many \\"stars\\" for one film - but if you look at the films of the 60's and 70's (especially Robert Altman films) that's all part of the magic. The cast has as much fun as the audience and everyone goes home happy. Enjoy this film! It's meant to be fun!!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.I never knew where  was the story was going although I tried to solve the mysteries. Never guessed the ending.Good job!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Admit it, everyone who has seen this movie went into ther attic and looked for a tresure map hoping to go on an adventure like this?? Perfect movie for a kid growing up in the 80's. They sure as hell dont make movies like this anymore!!!!
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I thought Francine Jay did a good job.  Her methodology was good and it was easy to follow.  I think because of the ease with which it is written, people might not think what she has to say is important; however, if you begin to practice what she gives for ideas, you will find that you have less but enjoy that which you have more.  You will also find that less makes you happier or, at least, that was the case with me.  There is less to clean and deal with and today's world, that is a plus.  It makes you aware of your &#34;footprint&#34; and what you can do with the time, money, and space you uncover in minimalism -- including philanthropy!.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I'm new to the tablet world and was having trouble getting onto Twitter. I didn't know I needed an app but once I downloaded the app it took me to the sign on page and I've had no problems since.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Some friends of our suggested we should watch this show. I bought season one and we have watched three episodes a night. It's that addictive. I will now have to get season two and keep watching.
1469984202|3.0|I must admit I am shocked at how many people have reviewed this book so positively. It certainly was a enjoyable read and a somewhat unique premiss. I found myself however skipping over pages as the characters drooned on about what they were thinking and feeling. The action and novels movement forward was hampered by these diatribes. I never want to read a book where I can skip over 3, 4 or even 5 pages and not miss anything. But I am obviously in the minority. People loved this book. I think it could have been 200 pages less.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Love this CD. Every single song is good! It is one you like right away. As opposed to some you have to listen to a few times before liking.
076790382X|2.0|The thing that makes stories about everyday minutiae funny is some semblance of believability. Nearly all of the \\"anecdotes\\" in this book are so exaggerated and unbelievable that they are simply not funny. It is far too easy to exaggerate any situation to make it so ridiculous that it becomes \\"humorous\\". That is what Mr. Bryson does with most of the stories in this book and it quickly becomes very repetitive and irritating. What is even more annoying is when there are flat out factual inaccuracies used in an attempt to make an already exaggerated situation even more \\"humorous\\" (Americanos always come with whipped cream?) I was determined to finish the entire book in hopes that things would evolve but this was not the case until the last two stories of the book (No. 69 and 70). To give Mr. Bryson a bit of slack, I've heard that this particular book is not his best one to start off with so I hope to give him a second chance.
1455519006|3.0|Too many &#34;jump the shark&#34; moments.  Very far fetched for my taste.  Disagreeable main character left me unsympathetic to<br />his cause.  Not the kind of a man I would care to know.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Poor Clint has lost it. His acting in this film is nothing short of awful.  They plot is predictable and over done.
0316069434|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the story.  Connelly's characters are always interesting and fun to learn about.  The story line is well developed with just enough mystery and diversion to keep it interesting.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game is great not too hard to solve but fun to play! Great graphics and easy to navigate though the game. To top it off its free!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds so addicting. I love it love it love it. It worth the download too fun love it
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Good movie.  Loved the idea of a plastic city.  Would recommend as a good family movie for all ages.  Would definitely watch again and again.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|My boy friend downloaded this for the kids and all the kids do is slap the cat until his falls. qnd the noise gets so annoying geez!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Love Bruce Willis.  Will watch this movie over and over again.  Lots of action and a little romance on the side.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Another Vampire movie?<br />Only this one is more for grown ups.<br />What a wicked twist on the History of the Civil War and<br />President Abraham Lincoln.<br /><br />Action packed History lesson.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This storyline grabs you right from the start.  You can place yourself in Katniss's shoes.  When younger sister Prim's name is called, you are thankful for Katniss and the desire to protect her sister Prim.  As the story unfolds, you love the people in the Capitol as much as you hate them.  The friendships and &#34;unexpected between the line&#34; storys will keep you on the edge of your seet.  It was hard to put down and well worth the read.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|loved it when it originally came out..loved just as much now!!<br />my favorite line on the movie...your sexier then socks on a rooster!.....LOL
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I left IT for the dark side (to work at a hardware/software vendor) some 5 years ago, and have never looked back - until now.<br /><br />Frequently, I work with customers stuck in the same muck & mire described in these pages and have lived through it in my past life.  The \\"stuck\\" IT pros I work with now regard terms like Cloud & DevOps as more techno-hype that will fail to deliver - and I understand their skepticism.  What The Phoenix Project does is contextualizes the practical employment of the DevOps philosophy, and the promise for restoring faith & order in IT.  If you are looking to re-energize your IT career, understand DevOps, or simply need a good read for your next bit of biz travel, I recommend this book.<br /><br />How often have you longed for a way to articulate the business value of IT and how to integrate into the fabric of all other business functions?  What business doesn't utterly rely on IT?  Yet, how many still regard IT as at best, a cost center, and at worst, a roadblock?  The Phoenix Project shows a way out of this cycle of pain, either by re-vamping your current IT department infrastructure, or by showing you the infrastructure of an IT organization that really works, so you can seek one out in your next job!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Very funny movie!  I was a little concerned it would be more of a girls movie, but I was laughing hard a number of times.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Here isthe happy  ending to the series that we've been waiting for.  I  hope that you enjoy it.  It did.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book format is not easy to read - there are no numbered chapters - so navigating in it is very difficult.  The main character is narcissistic and probably psychopathic, so some allowances for language must be made, but even considering this - the language was unnecessarily vulgar. The book ends abruptly with a ridiculous ending - one that seems like ...&#34;well the book is getting kind of long.. better wrap it up.&#34;  Absolutely hated it.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|Good read.  Felt their pain through the miles. Questions never answered: Why did they walk?, What happened to the millionaires that once were?
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I really like this app. Now if I could just round up lots of people to play it with me.
B004G600A4|5.0|Loved this much to my surprise. I thought it was new and fresh and very witty. My boys, who in general, do not care for the &#34;girlie&#34; Disney movies loved it too. Very entertaining and witty (as well as, very Disney, but ...).
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Disappointed.  Was not up for the calibar of content.  Really did not understand Albom's message.  My lack of intelligence I am sure.  All Mitch Albom's other books have really had an impact on my sense of spirituality.  I did not get this book at all.  Maybe I should reread.
B000002J0P|5.0|I love this cd as well. I haven't heard these songs in a long time and I'm glad  I bouught it
B006LSZECO|4.0|Excellent read for the beach.  Real page turner. Back and forthing with the characters.  She was quite the character and could easitly be made into a movie made for TV.
B000E97X66|4.0|I like this one a lot.  I'm satisfied with it. It has many of my favorite Springstein songs, so I'm happy with it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best game ever.  It is awesome because on part of it you are on a train cart thing and you have to tilt your tablet or what ever you are playing it on to stay put on the broken track it might sound hard but it is really easy when you get to play for a while or if it looks easy to you then you are a true believer in the game. Rock on peeps!!!!!
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|I JUST NUTTED IN MY PANTS TWICE, AND THE FIRST SONG ISN'T EVEN OVER, but seriously though, this album is great, a lot of care was put into its production. This album is one of Bad Religions best.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A very good game. Teaches you about houses. How to have responsibility for something. I would recommend it for others. Thank you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really fun. I love my little horse Lol. it teaches good responsibility. I recommend this game to any and every one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I would give this trilogy TEN stars if I could.<br />I recommend this book to anyone that would want a action packed adventure<br />P.S. read the epilogue
B001GMH8RO|5.0|The Blu Ray version of Ghost really brings the movie to life. The HD quality both visually and in sound are both impressive. The shots of the architecture in NY and specific scenes add depth and dimension to the movie. It aesthetically is stunning and far more pleasing than the regular versions. It does not take away from the story in any way but allows the story to be relatable even if it was made 23 years ago. It's a great addition to the collection and unlike some Blu Ray conversions from older films, this one is the highest quality conversion I have seen yet.
B007V65R54|4.0|Nate Silver is a great writer and does a wonderful job of explaining the difference between causation and correlation.  The beginning of the book is interesting and wonderful.  As the book goes on, however, it becomes less entertaining and enjoyable.  I recommend it, particularly for the beginning, but you may find yourself skimming over the later chapters.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I think the series was well written and entertaining. I would recommend this book to any one who likes romance novels as well.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Keeps me mellow when driving around in D.C. area traffic!  A great compilation, with good tonal qualities.  Very happy to have purchased this!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I had a hard time with the perplexus. It taught me to be patient but have fun while doing it. I had a lot of fun with it. I have passed it on to my friends for them to enjoy it.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Diana Gabaldon provides the ongoing, very well told and Intriguing fantasy, historical romance story.  Start with the first book in the series to fully enjoy the tale.
1451696191|5.0|After a month of anticipation, the book finally arrived. It is exactly what I expected and I am very happy with it.
B00APUQH0W|2.0|Clint Eastwood: Great as ever.<br />Amy Adams: She played her part fine, but left me wanting a bit more.<br />Justin Timberlake: Like the guy and his character is likable as well, but feels miscast.<br />John Goodman: Gives a strong supporting role performance.<br /><br />I liked the concept of the movie, but it felt very formulaic. You'll likely be able to figure out very quickly where the movie is headed, which is fine, but the execution feels clumsy.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|The Marware Vibe Standing case for Kindle Fire HD has an interesting wood-grain texture on the front cover.  I like the sturdy plastic X frame that the tablet securely snaps into and the protective sueded lining.  It has the instant-wake magnets and stays shut with an elastic strap that is positioned close to the edge of the cover for easy opening and closing.<br /><br />The only think I don't like is that the outside material isn't fastened to the hard backing structure so that it buckles and sags when the cover is open and is wavy on the back flap even when the cover is closed.  This makes it look a little cheaper than similar cases.
B005LAII94|3.0|Now, there's two ways to look at violence in movies. You can wave it off and pretend it doesn't influence anything or you can say that it surely plays a role in today's craziness in our society.  There are so many troubled people out there, how can you really make yourself believe that the violence you see in Hollywood doesn't contribute to put crazy ideas in their heads? Especially when the characters using that violence are so jaded about it? It has to have at least a minimum impact. This Oliver Stone movie, this \\"Savages\\" , is well done, with great actors, great cinematography, great editing and music. The rhythm is hypnotizing and you really want to know how the heck it's going to end. But I had trouble with the violence. And the way it was portrayed. Maybe I'm getting old. I still love action, though. But when you see all the real shootings happening out there and all the sadness caused by the real weapons and the psychos using them, it sure makes you wonder about the righteousness of Oliver Stone's goal here.  Do we really need to be reminded how savage we can be? Right now? In 2013? A lot of people are complaining (rightly so, I think) about the role of Hollywood in today's culture of weapons. I know we can't simply stop doing action movies but c'mon...  this is Hollywood's response? Anyways, it's still a great film, in terms of structure and suspense.  If you don't mind the violence, the guns and torture. After all, it's just a movie, huh?
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Graphics were great and storyline. Really enjoyed it. Im glsd they added pieces of real history to it, I was afraid it wad going to be too fictitious.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|It was nice seeing Zeppelin back together for one more time.  They played great songs, plant can still sing well.  I highly recommend it.
145162607X|5.0|It lived up to my expectations. Of course I am a big fan of Philippa Gregory.  I have read most of her books and she always delivers.
B000001ED1|5.0|Probably the coolest thing about Joan Osborne is her statement that she felt nothing so much as a great sense of relief after all the hoopla about her initial success (and THIS song) died down. It's a great tune to be sure, but like Cyndi Lauper, Loudon Wainwright and Maria Muldaur and any number of genuine talents who've hit the big time with novelty numbers, it's NOT all she was about.  Far from it.  As the rest of the album shows amply, she was capable of putting together a collection of sophisticated bluesy rock with intelligent, evocative lyrics.  I mean, what else can you say about an album where the Dylan cover (\\"Man In the Long Black Coat\\") is just one of many songs with gripping lyrics?  \\"St. Teresa,\\" the album's opening track (and the one that immediately precedes \\"Black Coat\\") is every bit as rich, as multi-leveled and actually more deliciously ambivalent than Dylan's bleak, offhandedly sinister tune.<br /><br />I first had heard of Joan Osborne as a blues-rock phenomenon with great potential.  So in my mind's ear, I was thinking someone in the Janis-vein, or maybe a Tracy Nelson type.  I'd later find something of THAT Joan Osborne on her EARLY RECORDINGS, but there are hints of that kind of blues power on RELISH as well.  \\"Right Hand Man,\\" the album's second single, is one of those textbook blues rock songs you want to analyze just to figure out when she manages to take a breath.  (Reminds me a bit of Janis' \\"Last Time\\" in that regard.)  If you like your swampy blues with a bit of surrealism, then \\"Spider Web\\" (or as I call it, \\"The Ray Charles Dream Song\\") should be right up your twisted alley.<br /><br />Aside from the Janis connection, Osborne has sometimes been compared to Stevie Nicks and other raspy rockers.  I can hear that, but I'd say she's more on the order of a Bonnie Raitt, using the occasional rasp for coloration but also capable of singing with a near crystalline clarity at other times.  In fact on \\"Ladder\\" and \\"Oh, My Crazy Baby,\\" she reminds me of no one so much as (maybe a somewhat funkier)Linda Ronstadt.<br /><br />I mentioned Cyndi Lauper in the opening paragraph, and there are reasons to expand on that connection a little bit as well.  As was the case Lauper's megahit solo debut (SHE'S SO UNUSUAL, natch), this record was produced by Rich Chertoff--and featured collaborations with Rob Hyman (and, in Joan's case, also Eric Bazilian who with Hyman formed the songwriting core of the Hooters).  It's not hard to see recognize some of the creative forces behind these breakthrough albums as relating to producer Chertoff's considerable influence.  And it's not surprising that both singers joined Chertoff on his remarkable Dvorak influenced vanity project LARGO (which you really need to hear if you're a fan of ANY of the contributing artists).<br /><br />At the height of the chart success of \\"One of Us,\\" I recall Joan Osborne actually gracing the front page of THE NEW YORK POST (if one can truly be said to \\"grace\\" the cover of that scandal sheet).  I don't recall the headline exactly, but it was the kind of faux-indignation the POST specializes in re: the supposedly sacrilegious nature of the tune.  You can argue that there's no such thing as bad publicity, but I can't help but think there is--if you're an artist who takes herself and her work as seriously as Joan Osborne clearly does.  \\"One of Us\\" made her, at least for a time, a household name, but I can't help thinking that what Joan Osborne would have preferred is to just be \\"a slob like one of us.\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book because everyone at work told me how great it was. Glad I did! I couldn't put it down. And the same day I finished it I went out and bought the second book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Enjoying Temple Run 2 (loved the orginal)  can't  wait to get the hang of riding in the rail -car. Love all the new additions can't wait to play it on my brothers new Kindle Fire HD (bet the graffics are sweet).
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|All I can say is, I wish I could spare the money to go premium with DI!  I've love di.fm for years, and I love having it for my Kindle Fire, too.
B0002TJGQS|4.0|I bought this for my car remote.  for the price it's a great deal since you get 5 of them.  not sure if this would last as long as the original battery.  I notice on the original battery there was an extra letter on the part number. either way the price is great
B00A757EFW|2.0|- it may just be me, but i find it very difficult to use the &#34;control&#34; - very frustrating -
B004927I50|5.0|I do love this product, it is exactly what I expected and it came well before it was expected to come.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This is always going to be considered a classic by adults and children every where.  Love the story and all the characters.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter and she really like it.  She really enjoys all the movies in the  series.  Item as described fast shipping
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Great Series!<br />Lucy Lawless is awesome in this.<br />Great acting as well as awesome special effects.<br />Takes history of Spartacus to a whole new level.<br />I Recommend this to everyone.
B008GFI4KY|5.0|On first listen this album didn't jump out at me, but after repeated listening not only has it grown on me, but it's become my favorite album out of the 3. She's just a girl Eddie and Concrete are my two favorite tracks, just great songwriting with killer hooks and expert playing. it's a shame people don't take this band seriously, cause they are the best band on the scene today, and the best live act ever
B00B19DMUE|2.0|This movie was your typical exorcist movie.  It wasn't new and original.  Granted, I didn't realize it was based on true story at first.
B00026WU7I|5.0|Again Dylan's genious comes through on this album. I had this on vinyl but never got around to buying it on cd.But after listening to Blonde on Blonde I remembered how great Blood on the Tracks was. So I bought the cd and every track was as great as I remembered. Dylan is truly one of America's greatest singer song writers. I would highly recommend this album to everyone.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|This movie had great ratings and I had heard so much about it, but to me it felt like the story was going nowhere.  There was no point.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Loved it instantly...repeatedly listen to it! My new favorite album next to Jack White's Blunderbuss. Cant wait for the Grammy's.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|It was OK, a bit funny in parts, a lot predictable in others.  Most jokes were spoon feed and over worked.
0142413828|5.0|You never know with Roald Dahl -- you could end up with Esio Trot Puos.<br /><br />The story is Ylpmis Suolucidir, and that is why my children Ti Evol!<br /><br />\\"Poo is a very strong word in any language\\" -- that is their favorite line.<br /><br />This is a great, sweet story from Roald Dahl -- along the same age level as \\"The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me\\" [[ASIN:0141322780 Giraffe and the Pelly and Me]]
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|It seemed OK, but not riveting.  I feel asleep about half way through the movie.  I prefer the original one over this re-telling.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|it has a big build up to a very unsatisfying ending. No real insight or detective work leading to the killer.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Great job by JJ Abrams and cast/crew to re-imagine the series. Blast from the past (like Star Trek: Generations) helps to connect new and old.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|great game love it but it can get spendy if you hate to wait (like me)  and you can get every dragon without spending a penny but I was wondering how do you get an air dragon??? will be checking back for answers. :)
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|She LOVES ALW but is a fanatic about Phantom and this sequel.  We have the Blu-ray, the CDs, the sheet music.  The kid is obsessed!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My kids love it, but some of the later levels are well above their ability to solve, and it becomes a source of frustration.  Other than that, it's awesome!
B005M0X078|5.0|She LOVES ALW but is a fanatic about Phantom and the sequel Love Never Dies.  We have the Blu-ray, the CDs, the sheet music.  The kid is obsessed!
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Merriam Webster is  the resource of choice for the Scripps National Spelling Bee, however, many words from the Bee are not included in this program.  That to me should have been a given.  More than a few words we even looked up on their site online, and were asked to &#34;subscribe&#34; to get the definition.  At least offer an app I can pay a price for, and receive the WHOLE RESOURCE.  Not a free app that requires me to subscribe to their website.  I'll pay for an app if I can get every last word/pronunciation in it that they have in their printed edition.  This one thing is the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars.
B004TI5N38|2.0|Really some good twists in the story. Puller the ultimate soldier. Probably more true than we would like to believe about bureaucracy
B008MEM24S|5.0|It's a game that forces my children to use their problem solving skills!  And my second grader has learned a lot from it, he gets such a kick out of solving each level!
B001CDWFPC|5.0|LOVE this study Bible.  It was recommended by our son and we've since recommended it to many.  Easy to understand and a great addition.
8866130915|5.0|This is my fourth Moleskine planner, and I don't think I'll ever buy another brand. I did think this was the medium size, but it's actually the smaller size. That's my fault though; I should have read the description more closely. I thought I wouldn't like the size, but it's actually kind of nice. I can fit it in my pocket, and I don't need to bring my bag along.
B005USZYDU|3.0|My husband is the avid reader and loves Grisham books, but said this one was not one of his best.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing this game, it is very addicting. My son has even taking the kindle from me to play this one, we actually fight over it.  I love these type of machines at arcades !! :-)

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is such a joy to watch: David Attenborough's narration, the exceptional photography, the completely fascinating organisms...<br /><br />Too bad I bought it as a gift for my dad! :)
B004J4WN0I|5.0|A completely new fantasy style.<br />involving several religious background whit humor but not insulting.<br />a modern fantasy with a really interesting ovewrview on the religion and faith around the world.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Howey has more than successfully put together a plausible post-apocalyptic scenario,he has given an engaging gift. Just read it!<br />mtoney

B004A8ZWSS|5.0|This is a great movie and certainly an asset to my vast collection. Arrived faster than a speeding bullit too!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Interesting storyline, but the characters were too superficial.  I would have liked to have a bit more insight into them.
B000244G36|5.0|This is a great older movie and certainly an asset to my vast collection. Excellent quality too. Arrived faster than a speeding bullit!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is an awesome game, but the game does glitch a little...it just be when you get really far that the device cant keep up. Overall its a good game and you should get it as soon possible. :)
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is a great movie and certainly an asset to my vast collection. Arrived faster than a speeding bullit too!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|It's a great book. Love reading it on the kindle app on my iPad.  I would recommend the kindle app
B002IU4TLQ|5.0|This is a great movie.  As a movie that's been on TV many times, it's still a great addition for my movie collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great read.  I loved the main characters.  I chose it after reading Hoover's book Slammed, which I would also recommend.
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|This is a great movie and certainly an asset to my vast collection. Arrived faster than a speeding bullit too!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I would give this game a rating of 5 stars because it is a fast pace and the graphics are a lot better than Temple Run.
0783226888|5.0|This is a great movie and certainly an asset to my vast collection. Arrived faster than a speeding bullit too!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I got this app I thought, eh probably just a clone. Boy was I wrong!!! This game is far superior to its older sibling, I love the new graphics and obstacles 5/5
B00006CXGH|5.0|This is a great older movie and certainly an asset to my vast collection. Arrived faster than a speeding bullit too!
B001Q4Z5UY|5.0|action packed movie! really enjoyed it i would highly suggest you buy it! i loved it.. thank you i hope you enjoy
B0021L8V0M|5.0|This is a great movie and certainly an asset to my vast collection. Arrived faster than a speeding bullit too!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I very attractive functional case for my Kindle HD.  It provide several angles to read so it is reasonable versatile.
B0013LL2Z2|3.0|This is an older movie but I expected it to be digitally mastered in this day and age.  Quality not that good.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We purchased the EPIC version of the Perplexus toy after the first was such a big hit at home.  This version is more complex than the original and does not disappoint in the fun department!
B001PPLIEG|4.0|The product was attractively priced.  However, package looked a bit cheap.  Perhaps, the next time I would have better luck.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A very lovely book. I really enjoyed it. It's definitely on my top 5 favorite books of all time. An absolute must read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If with all the emotional roller coaster aspects I love this book.<br /><br />I cannot wait to see this movie!<br /><br />Great read, definitely get it if you haven't already!
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I kept getting a memory error for large documents. Purchased this which was much lower than the $500 HP.com wanted.  The documents I was having problems with printed with no problem.  I am very happy!
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Bought this for a gift for family member. Everyone enjoyed. This movie is an excellent movie. Enjoyed Clint Eastwood's performance.
B008745B32|5.0|Brideshead Revisited was my first introduction to Evelyn Waugh (just happened to be a kindle deal). I found myself enjoying his gorgeous writing even more than the story itself, however, the novel held my attention to the end and I would highly recommend it. Looking forward to reading some of his humorous pieces as I enjoyed the bits of humor in this novel very much.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I liked this anti virus program for my Kindle.  I had it on my laptop also. Would recommend this for anyone.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I love the Harry Bosch series, but having said that this was not my favorite. I usually can't wait to get the book done but this one I had to keep coming back to.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|I love this movie and the characters. It was very well done and keeps you spellbound to the very end.
B008XNZMOU|2.0|I think Taylor has been influenced by her associates and consequently her music has changed from being very fine ... to the typical not so nice music by artists that do not know good music, but think they do.
0141345659|4.0|I liked the story line.  It was very interesting.<br />I did not like the vulgar language - the swear words.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|This movie was supposed to be awesome; the best time travel/science fiction movie in a long time.  I thought it was merely an ok action flick.  I hated the make-up they put on Joseph Gordon-Levitt; I found it very distracting and completely unnecessary.
0061537969|4.0|I read this book and gave a copy as a present to someone who loves dogs and is interested in auto racing. Bviously, there is more more to it thatn that!  Parenting and families and all the humor and pain associated with both.
B004G0DN7W|5.0|I love westerns and I love science fiction and this movie has them both.  I was pretty young the first time I saw this movie and I very much wanted it to be real!!  I remember owning a copy of this movie on laser disk and I watched it every day.  This is not the best acted movie in the world but I loved the concept and it holds a dear, nostalgic place in my heart.  I would absolutely pay $1000/day to spend some time in Westworld...without the crazy killer robots of course...
055338466X|4.0|The way I interpret this book, we are not even close to an overall theory about the physical world around us. In fact, according to authors Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow, there may be many other universes, (10 to the 300th power). And, they may not play by the same scientific rules as our universe does. That is something to ponder.<br />This book is very well illustrated, with color prints and cartoons. It is also set up for the lay reader, (as much as any book on science can be); but it will still leave you scratching your head if you are not that familiar with the material. But if you want the truth you should get it straight from the expert's mouth, (and Mr. Hawking is very qualified in that regard).<br />There is no way to dumb-down quantum mechanics or alternate histories, it is either take-it-or-leave it. When I decide to tackle a book like this I just grab a handle and hang on for the ride, (and for dear life). Our very existence on this planet is in the details. It does make me want to investigate further, (but I had better watch my physics video tutor first to get a better grasp).<br />I mean, who doesn't ponder the big questions? Of course, the old maxim applies, the more we know the more we realize that we don't know. The smugness that could go along with the accumulation of empirical knowledge is counter-productive to the spirit of curiosity. It is the people who are never intellectually satisfied who push the human race forward. It is not enough to accept the facts as presented. You should ask yourself why it happened, and how.<br />According to Mr. Hawking there is no accepted GUT, (Grand Unified Theory), so we are forced to patch together different models to find answers. Many of the present theories do not mesh with one another, (or the connections between them have not been deciphered yet, at least in their totality). So, if we are ever to figure out why there is something rather than nothing we still have a lot of work to do. An example of agold fish in a bowl was used to illustrate the importance of perspective, and perception; because if we ever hope to make a big leap in knowledge we have to climb out of the confinements of our own self-limitation. In other words, don't be contented with swimming around in your comfort zone. A good place to start is reading this book.
B00932ANQM|2.0|I'm a fan of Nichols Sparks and loved Message in a Bottle and The Notebook.  But this movie was boring.  I didn't buy the chemistry between the two leads which just made the movie drag.  My wife said the movie differed quite a bit from the book and said the movie would have been better if they would have followed the book more closely.
0761169253|4.0|I definitely was lookin for some guidance lately and tho some of the things seemed like common sense...they really werent hahah this book is soo cute and small easy to carry around and I appreciate that you have like hw assignments to do LOL...I respond well to assignments and things like that. Even if you dont want to do everything in the book there are a good amount of tips and I love how concise and to the point it is. no fluff. GREAT BOOK!
0316017930|4.0|I enjoyed the audiobook read by Gladwell himself. He talks about how success comes from not only hard work but where you're from and even when you're born. The discussion about airline pilots and air traffic controllers was fascinating. I enjoyed this more than The Tipping Point.
B005XLN97M|4.0|Nice, kind of flimsy item but my girls like it. It was cheaper than any other retailer. Ok, ok, ok.
B00008S7KC|5.0|Came promptly and is just like the other one I already own.  Excellent PF concert tape....along with Pulse, it pretty much covers the Floyd catalogue.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|ok this game is really fun but i whent out one time and now i cant get back in to continue. i was like nooooooooooo its so good dont glich :(.so just warning u. :D
B00A1C1DYE|5.0|Great blu-ray quality and an excellent value for a blu-ray box set.  Been very happy with this purchase and the disc extras have been fun to watch.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This dictionary works very well on my kindle. It loads up very fast and has all the words you'll need. It has a pronunciation feature so it tells the words to you. And everything shows up well on screen.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This has been a great opportunity to find out :::I can NOT draw worth a hill of beans...as the saying goes.<br />Thank GOD for really good guessers. I have had soooo much fun playing this game and have seen some really GREAT drawrs.<br />The pictures are funny because I may not envision the drawing in the same way as the drawer sees the drawing. I know mine must be really hilarious to the people I play with. I know I laugh a lot playing this game.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This product is really good. Especially on my kindle. One problem is that it does take quite a while to load up. Other than that its a great download.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|This story is a classic Dr Seuss and it is very well done (a notch higher than the Thorax). Carrey does an outstanding job, along with the rest of the voice cast. I highly recommend this to families with younger children, but it is well enough done that it satisfies the kid in all of us adults.
0547884591|2.0|An unedited compilation of recipes and random \\"How Stuff Works\\" articles; interspersed with 300 pages highlighting the author's industry connections and infatuation with top chefs. I purchased the book hoping to get a basic, no frills introduction to paleo/\\"slow-carb\\" cooking; specifically hoping to learn how to integrate herbs/spices to traditionally \\"slow-carb\\" meals to add flavor to bland protein/fat based meals. The book accomplishes this to some extent, but sandwiches the information among hundreds of pages of arbitrary information and Tim Ferriss personal anecdotes. If that's what you're into, you'll love the book. If you're looking for \\"slow-carb\\"/paleo recipes, you're better off just googling it.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Without a doubt, Victor Hugo's story is a classic and it didn't take me long to be mesmerized by the story. The translation in this version is decent and carries with it all the hallmarks that makes this such a great classic in literature.
0765356139|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has me hooked.  He has a light but witty style.  He is imaginative and thoughtful in a refreshing, quick read sort of way.  Captivating but won't weigh you down.  Very good, fast and pleasant read.
B0053O89IS|3.0|The writers need to do something about the inane approach they are taking with Brennan's character and her interaction with Booth. First, if these two are living together, why are they still addressing each other using their last names (or &#34;Bones&#34;). There is no romance in a relationship that has only one thing in common -- a baby. And then Brennan's ongoing stupidity is really getting long in the tooth. It no longer works on any level. Sure, she's an atheist, but she can't related the practices of any of the cultures she's studied to her own life. She is almost as dysfunctional an educated person can be as I've ever met (I actually met a family who was worse). The short season (thanks to the actresses actual pregnancy) made this set pricey in comparison to full seasons.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I happened to pick up this book just as I was beginning my own solo sojourn through South America. Through moments of trepidation, fear and loneliness, this book lent support and comfort and a sense of belonging, continually inspiring me to keep trekking... literally and metaphorically.
B004NOH9LC|1.0|I wonder if I would feel differently if I worked in the industry, maybe there is something I am missing due to this - but I found the lead character to be harshly grating on the nerves. After Ford's character joined the show I literally just lost interest in anything that happens after that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I  was so happy when it finally came out. I knew I just had to get it. It is so addicting and fun!
B0010SKUYM|3.0|I found this book to be very hard to stay interested in. The story was somewhat engaging, but went into far too<br />much  meaningless detail.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun and soo addicting.I love It!!I always play this every day. I run down the battery on my kindle fire.
B0099114WO|4.0|This is very funny and touching... could feel their pain....Tommy Lee Jones is so cute.  My husband likes Meryl Streep.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A very good game and very addictive and much better than TR 1 with the new items in the game
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Great movie to all who have not seen. Great price too!! If you love a good romance this is right up your alley!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I couldn't put this game down. Played it almost nonstop to the end. Disappointed in the ending. I felt like there was such a story to this game but then when you finished the game they didn't finish the story. That's why I gave four instead of five stars. Addictive game. Just blah ending.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|You can't beat the price for this and my kids are really loving Dr Suess now. Highly recommend to anyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so plur get it now :) it was so fun I got addicted and cant stop playing help me;)
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids love this movie and it made sense to snap it up when the price was so low. Great!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game because it's so addictive and fun!!!!!!  I downloaded this game and I have never played a different game since I got this game!!!! This game ROCKS!!!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The book tells a story about August, a boy with a rare facial disease and his ups and downs during his first year of school in 5th grade. It is a great heartwarming story.
B003WJQ74E|4.0|Effective depiction of the life of a mentally challenged individual who is chosen as the subject of an unclearly-described but nonetheless successful experiment to increase his intelligence.  Charlie, first seen as the lowest-rung worker at a small bakery, is soon able to intellectually understand far more than he is emotionally equipped to deal with.  His new-found intelligence and understanding, however, is transitory and, like the mouse, Algernon, the first animate subject of the procedure, he gradually sinks back to the mental level at which we first saw him.<br /><br />Despite some really dated psychology, virtually nonexistent science, and a touch of the psychedelic, the book is strangely effective in its treatment of the day-to-day as Charlie arcs from retardation to brilliance to retardation.<br /><br />The novel is somewhat bloated compared to the short story of the  same title that proceeded it.  A cautionary tale?  A morality play?  An anti-science warning?  A loving portrayal of the less-gifted among us?  Flowers For Algernon is all of these.  And it is, despite some quirks, still effective and very much recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Read it in a couple of days so it can keep your interest but I found myself getting annoyed at some things Collins does. Def a page turner but pretty lame at some points, mostly the ending. Also I found myself wanting to slap katniss in the face at multiple points in the story. Probably not something you want in a protagonist.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I will begin by saying, I am not a Nicholas Sparks super fan.  I enjoy his books, I know that for 95% of them they will just be alright, there will be nothing ground breaking about them and that's okay.  The end will then of course have me in tears and leave me convinced that it was an amazing book.  This book had a large piece of the plot that was obvious rather quickly and I hoped would not actually happen, it did and quite frankly I feel that it degraded the book tremendously and spoiled the ending for me (not a single tear, I was too annoyed).  I also would have preferred seeing more between Katie and Alex, I wanted more interaction between then, the slow building of their relationship and not just Katie spilling everything.  I would recommend unless you are NS junkie to skip this one.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is awesome get it now all people will like it AWSOME AWSOME save animals hurry you will like it again amazing
0321885112|4.0|In theory this book shouldn't be for me. I can't draw to save my life and don't really have a ton of interest getting better. I'm also not a huge note taker at events. All of those disclaimers aside, I loved this book and found it very useful. How you ask (and if you aren't asking how someone who can't draw, doesn't really want to and doesn't spend much time at conferences, then you really should be)? Well, it has encourage me to really look at the way I go about notes in everyday meetings.<br /><br />While I may not be heading to SXSW anytime soon, I'm most certainly going to be in a meeting at some point during the next week. While time will tell, I believe the approach of this book will have a big impact on the way I approach these. Even if I never get up the courage to add drawings, I believe the concepts inside will help me do a far better job of identifying what's actually important in the span of a meeting from what's actually being said (which can often cause all of the important stuff to get lost).<br /><br />Despite my awful handwriting and even less desirable drawing skills, I believe my notes will begin to look better and more organized based on the ideas in this book. I also believe they will be more pleasant and useful to look back upon. In fact, I'd love the hell out of a follow up that focused on the best possible ways to leverage sketchnotes in a more traditional meeting setting (I'd imagine the section on not drawing offensive pictures of your boss to be very helpful).<br /><br />If I had to say one negative thing about the book (I should at least explain why I only gave it four stars), it would be that it was too beautiful (and it really is, every page is hand drawn awesomeness). Much as the book encourages anyone (even me) to draw, it doesn't really show what this looks like. It goes into the idea of simple Sketchnotes, but doesn't really show bad ones. It did however encourage me to try in spite of my natural disinclination, so perhaps in this case it was better to tell and not show...<br /><br />Bottom line: if you take notes and struggle to make them useful, buy this book. Just understand that it focuses in on Rhode's experience \\"Sketchnoting\\" conferences. That said, it isn't all that difficult to extrapolate the lessons into whatever it is you happen to be taking notes on.ase it was better to tell and not show...<br /><br />Bottom line: if you take notes and struggle to make them useful, buy this book.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is really good there is a decent variety of sounds to help me relax and fall asleep.  It also seems to help keep me asleep.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I love this movie, we watch it every xmas.  The quality is good and I am glad I bought it.
B005F9TPZ2|4.0|Fiona Apple's music is unique sounding to me.  I like how she seems to have a really strong voice.  This album is worth the money in my opinion.
B0043URV5U|5.0|This is the best CD to listen to, because if you like classic rock this is the one to have.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|I love Paramore and have so far enjoyed all of their albums! The only complaint I have is that not one of them other than the Twilight soundtrack has their song Decode on it and I love that song. Other than that great CD and listen to it and the others I have often.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|If you are a Harry Potter fan like me you should have all of them whether you like it or not. I would highly recommend having the whole set and watching them together till the end. There is not one Harry Potter movie that I didn't enjoy!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This puzzle challenging. game is great. and very calming. I recommend. downloading it. and sit and relax as you put these puzzle pieces in their place. definitely. a 5 star rating. keep creating more.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|i really enjoy this game. It moves at a nice pace. There are many levels to unlock i find it to be a lot of fun.
B009EEEW7A|5.0|I loved this movie.  Action all the way!  The ending was a little disappointing, but left an opening for a follow on episode.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Could be more fun if I could find random players and things weren't so expensive!! You need lots of ponies, but the pony cost so much and you would have to sit there all day everyday for a month to get enough money for one pony!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|If not for the awe inspiring games in the collection, get it for the month free of Playstation Plus. It's a great trial for a cheap price!
B00APUQJLO|1.0|It sucks waste of money and time worst movie ever no plot or at least I couldn't find one !!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|cool. awesome. fun. very fun. buy it. installnit now. I don't know what else to say. get this game it is fun and interesting. keeps me occupied for hours. just got it and I love it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is absolutely amazing! It is so well written, the writers are great, and the cast is one of the best I've ever seen!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|It is a great movie, excellent effects. A little expensive tough. I can't wait to see the next one, hurry up !!
0143118757|5.0|I'm an ADR master's degree student at the University of Denver. This book is a classic, really giving rise to the whole practice of ADR in many ways. It is still one of the most practical and realistic books on the subject, without a doubt.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The best action movie from all times !! Hulk, captain america, thor, IronMan together ! can't wait for the next one
0061743526|5.0|Reading this story once is never enough. Reading it and watching the movie is epic. A must have for any literary enthusiast!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|If you like action movies, this is the movie to watch. It has excellent effects, and great story. This is a must have for action lovers.
B006FE83UE|5.0|An all time favorite movie and the extra features are almost as interesting as the movie. Reading the book just adds to the experience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this APP!  it is definatly with it espically because it is free.  I don 't like that you have to buy stuff with gems.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I know the title is snarky.  I really enjoyed the book.  I'm not a King fan-boy...this is likely the first book I've read by him (over 50 years, you sometimes forget what you've read).  I do like his prose style.  It is almost conversational.  Character development was excellent and the plots were interestingly inter-woven.<br /><br />The book was a good price when I got it on Kindle, so I can't be too critical.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I appreciate concise prose.  This book was overly long with way too many branches that were not central to the main or sub-themes.  A good indicator of this was that it was possible to skip entire pages of text and not miss it.<br /><br />Despite the length, the book was worthwhile.  If any area was under-described, it was Jake's last trip to 1958.  Much more could have been written about the altered effects subsequent to his Dallas intervention.<br /><br />I would recommend the book to avid readers, but it will be awhile before I pick up another King SuperSize Me novel.
B004JK61K0|4.0|I was having trouble with the e-mail app that came with my Kindle Fire HD<br /> No problems with this doggie e-mail<br />easy to install, easy to use
B009329Y30|4.0|If you like fun, romantic movies...this will satisfy your needs! Lol! Well done, and well acted, which always helps too!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie never fails to make me laugh.  The quintessential holiday movie.  It was made a while ago, but it's a class at this point.  I highly recommend!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I love films that make me think, and want to watch again to make sure I figured it out right! This one did just that!
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|Tim Burton generally amuses me, but this one left me cold. It was dead in the water. It was a variation on a theme he's pretty much worn out: dead companion brought back to life to fill out a few nasty minutes of viewing time. &#34;Corpse Bride&#34; pretty much ended it for me. &#34;Frankenweenie&#34; was so uninteresting, even with the usual excellent stop motion animation, that I couldn't finish watching it. I give it two stars out of pity. It's more like a one star effort
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I was really looking forward to watching this after my sister went on and on about how AWESOME it was....but it is just strangely stupid, I thought!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Very cost effective and durable, I lobve it.  I would have spent 5 times as much for this case at a wireless store.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I really enjoyed this game and I'm kind of glad I only paid a dollar for it. The hint guide was really helpful being that there was so many scenes to remember. I had a slight problem because I didn't get the spring flower while I was in that season. If u get sick u can always go and change the season back. I know one other person has that problem. If you re-read the clues u can back track to when u were supposed to get it and just go to that season and scene.hope I helped you out. Other than all the different sciences being out of order I enjoyed the game very much.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Nothing was missing while watching this show. They took everything from the book and put it right in the show. The acting and sets are top notch as well. If you are a fan of fantasy this is a must-watch for you. Warning though, this is a VERY MATURE SHOW.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the app is great and so worth getting and addictive if you,  loved the first you will love this one!
B008BM9L72|3.0|The first story is ok but by the third i was feeling so frustrated & that i was wasting my reading time, but I felt I couldn't quit on something i had already invested time in reading...younger woman might enjoy it i guess , but the main character is so frustratingly stupid!
B007VUA7VO|1.0|This application appears to have made my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 very choppy.  Upon advice from the Kindle forum, from a user (not 3 hours on the phone with a Kindle Tech) I have removed this app and everything is back to normal.  Thank God!<br /><br />I have learned a very important lesson.  There are a few apps that are very bad for the Kindle Fire HD - this is one of them.  I've had memory problems, freezing, and stuttering with this application.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP to your Kindle Fire HD.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love the game!!!!It is a good place to talk to friends on. Hope you love it as much as I do!!!!!!!
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This one surprised me. I've read some of the reviews about this movie and they are very unfair. This is one of Liam Neesons best. This is allot more that just a survival film. It explores many things like the human mind, what people do when there put in a situation were the laws and rules of mankind don't exist, and in a small way, faith. Yeah, some (and I mean 1 or 2) scenes have a few faults in them if you're really looking. But if you're looking that hard for faults in a movie then that may be the reason you didn't enjoy it. If you're a fan of Liam Neeson or just need something new to watch, this is one you should not miss. This is an easy 10/10
B000FA6720|5.0|I enjoyed reading this story. I definitely recommend it. I saw the movie first and the book is better but different.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|If you like her banter on 30 Rock, you'll find her style of childhood and career recollection quite entertaining. As I read I can almost see her quirky facial expression and her quick change in vocal inflection. Because there are no sensors... be aware of some adult language. Nothing over the top, but the first few examples caught me off guard and I had to think, &#34;wow... that would really come out of Tina Fey's mouth?&#34;<br /><br />If you're not an SNL, 30 Rock, or Tina Fey fan... you'll get nothing from this book. You really have to follow her work to appreciate the stories she tells in the book. If you are a fan... I give it a &#34;heavy&#34; 4 stars. Worth the $9 if you're buying it for your Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A relaxing way to own an animal. Fun. Interesting.  It includes all of the chores you need to do before owning a horse. Enjoying it!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Absolutely love this game. Highly addictive, except for the fact that it keeps force closing when you use your gems. Other than that I love the added things like the ropes and the mining carts!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Having death as narrator was unique.  But the book was so well written, dealing with this historic time - that was so sad - with a joy that is not often available.  Characters are well developed.
0979019710|5.0|So much of this information has been said over and over in my life, but never put in a way that it comes together and makes sense and inspires a choice to change. Truly, this choice will change your life!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app is just like the real thing on the computer. It doesn't lag, it's very repsonsive, and it posts tweets fast. You can't go wrong!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's the best app I have. Even though it isn't the complete full version, it is still super fun and I highly recommend it if you want to let your imagination run free.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I had been wanting to purchase the Hunger Games on disc for a while, but all the stores had it marked at high prices. The quality of this blu-ray disc is amazing! You just can't can't beat this. Reasonably priced and great movie. It's a steal!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A beautiful story of loss,longing,regret and redemption.I fell in love with Harold Fry and could not put down this book. Simply and beautifully written, it is moving,poignant,and a brilliant study of human relationships and how the unspoken moments can tear people apart.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great outline, great fonts, great font sizes, great everything! This e-Book is just something that is just so great! Buy it!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed this book!  Interesting facts/info on foster system.  Learning about language of flowers was fun!<br />It was just an enjoyable read - read it for my book club and eight of eight were excited about this book.  Great discussion after<br />also!
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I was looking for a way to practice my piano while not at home. This was the best app on the Amazon App Store that I could find. It's good, but it pales in comparison to other apps available through Google Play and iTunes.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This was an entertaining movie but I miss my main man the Joker. certainly worth renting or buying for your collection - for sure
B0086700CM|4.0|I have this game on my cell phone and I really liked it. I wanted to play the game on a larger device. The game is still just as good as it was, but with the size of the Kindle Fire you almost have to turn the device all the way on it's side to make your avatar go to the other side of the temple road. Other than that, it's great!
B009HEMW4W|2.0|I loved the original, liked the sequel and pretty much fell asleep during this one - kinda sucked in my opinion
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I luke this game a lot better than temple run has more stuff on it and its a lot more funner
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey shares funny and awkward stories of her youth. With some interesting insight into SNL and 30 Rock.  Easy read but entertaining.
B000UJ48VI|3.0|The movie was deleved quickly. The quality was not great. There were a half dozen 1 second skips in one scene. No big deal. But the last 15 minutes had issues. The voice stopped matching the mouth movements. Like an old apanese horror flic bad voice over. Annoying.
B001NHNG64|5.0|First of all I would buy any Lee Child novel sight unseen.<br /><br />These comments apply to all my Jack Reacher novel reviews.<br /><br />Each one has a different story to tell and you also learn more about Reacher, his family, and his character each time.  The plot line is so good that I get fascinated in trying to figure out how Reacher will prevail in the end.<br /><br />I should also mention that I bought all his novels in hard cover from the first published.<br /><br />I bought these eBooks so I could enjoy re-reading them on the new technology.<br /><br />I think I am enjoying the second read as much or more than the first.
B000BCE918|5.0|Some people complain about it and I think they're just finicky.<br />Some of my favorite movies boxed together for a great price.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this movie---turned out to be better than expected.  I was afraid that it was a true &#34;chick flick,&#34; but it was a nice story about family dynamics, aging parents and baseball.  All in all, highly recommended.  And I'm not even a baseball fan!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I'm having a good time playing this game. the graphics is not bad at all. hope I can make friends soon.
B0078N2T8I|1.0|This movie totally sucked. If you want to watch a movie that is depressing, disturbing and boring this one's for you.
B006FLGBGA|5.0|Its about time the planet of the apes series came back.. This movie kept me interested to the end, and nothing seemed horribly outlandish. It was believable.
0679809015|5.0|My 14 month old loves all the little flaps on this book and brings it to me several times a day for reading. It's a really small book (think deck of cards) which makes it easy to throw in my purse for distractions.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|Works great reads all my different video types. Easy to use and scan for new videos on my android phone
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game, I am addicted! The app is easy for kids to use and offers new challenges on different levels.
B0060AY85C|2.0|Didn't particularly care for the book or the ending ... just my opinion.  I have read other books by her and have enjoyed them more.
B007SGM084|3.0|Was too drawn out.  Too up and down.  Too predictable Was not worth the $$$ I paid for it was just okay
1416905014|5.0|Ordered this product for my 2 yr. old great-niece. Eventhough it wasn't seen in hand and bought online, recipients GrandMom, Mom and daughter loved it, were thrilled with it! Arrived on time and in great condition. Thrilled that they were thrilled! :) Very happy the delightful pop-up book brought them so much pleasure. I certainly would recommend it to my friends with children!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I downloaded it yesterday on my kindle fire. The kids &amp; I were excited until it wouldn't load today. I uninstalled it and re installed and it worked until I played my other games. they need to fix this or they will lose a ton of users. I refuse to delete &amp; reload a game over &amp; over just to play. fix this soon or I will delete this app.
B000002IV8|4.0|In NO way am I saying this is a sell-out album. In fact I do like experimental albums as long as they sound decent. Around this time we have had Metallica's Black Album, Megadeth's Countdown, and I actually like those albums. Sure they aren't Ride The Lightning, Peace Sells, or Horrorscope but they are still good in their own way. On this release we see the fellas from Overkill take a different direction in their music with a more accesible sound. The result is a good solid heavy metal/groove/hard rock (however you want to classify it) album. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. The production isn't the best on this one. The drums sound way too stale. Another thing I noticed, unlike typical Overkill fashion, the bass is hardly audible. Not that you can hear it from most bands in the genre with them, but to me, that is what always seperated Overkill from the second tier bands. The fact the guys always used the bass guitar as its own entity instead of adding substance to the drums and guitar is what made them interesting. But I will say this is one of their most melodic albums. The chorus on most of the songs are incredibly catchy. Gone are the days of gang vocal shouts on this album, but considering the fact this is an experimental album it is really good. You can also expect some blues riffs, which I really like on this one. I recomend this to anyone who likes hard rock and any Overkill fan. Personal favorite tracks: \\"I Hear Black, World of Hurt, Feed My Head, Spiritual Void, and Undying.\\"
B0076DELIG|5.0|Such a great read. On the edge the whole book. The book takes so many spins, and you never know until the end who dunnit!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Maybe it was because I read a lot of negative reviews before I decided to continue the series, or maybe its because my favorite characters were back.  Whatever the reason, I thought Dance With Dragons was just as good as the first three.  It's hard to tell when reading on a kindle, but it seemed to me that the chapters were shorter, which I liked.  Although I would love to have heard more from Arya and Bran, I'm content understanding their downtime is just part of the story.  I'm still a few chapters from the end and I've read complaints about the end, but I doubt even a cliffhanger ending will change my opinion.  I thought it was a great book.  Read it faster than any of the other four.
0452295548|5.0|My Stroke of Insight by Jill Bolte Taylor is a first-person account of the actual experience of having a stroke and recovering from it. The author is a brain scientist who understood what was happening to her and who communicates with wit and style. As a stroke survivor, myself, I found her experience riveting. What sets this book apart from many stroke survival accounts is her insight into how the stroke changed her physically and mentally. This is a rare look inside the brain and its function by a scientist who knows how to tell her fascinating story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the first one was good but this one is a little more difficult but i love it...it goes a little faster

B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It was the best game I ever played.You should defenetly play this game.The best lands are the snowy 1's.That's why I think you should play this game.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I can't believe I spent money on this stupid app. There are limited options and I can feel my brain dying a little when I play with this. I don't think this is even worthwhile for children. You have limited control and can't save your creations.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo had me change my password for mail.  It worked on the computer, but when I went to change it on my smart phone, I couldn't do it.  Tried to get help from Yahoo, but as usual, none of their help items covered my problem.  I contacted my carrier, and was told to just go to Amazon and get the app for Yahoo into my smartphone.  Just after I did that, my sign-in worked.  Thanks to the Amazon store.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|If you enjoyed the first two in Chris Nolan's trilogy you'll enjoy this one. Not as much Batman in this one as I'd like but the parts he WAS in I loved. One of my favoriite Superheroes of all time in a more realistic perspective than any other previous movies. Some supreme acting from all. Sir Michael Caine has set a new bar on Alfred. In the comics he always had a larger role in what Batman did and was refreshing to see it in these movies. Gary Oldman is one of my all time faves and he delievers very well as Gordan. Joseph Gorden Levitt as uh Blake is also something seen in the comics but with a Nolan twist to be sure. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle reminisce of Batman: Year One. Though in a sexy tight Catsuit(pun intended) she is still agile like a cat and just as viscous at times.  Christian Bale as Wayne and The Dark Knight himself was topnotch. I could go on about each of the actors in this movie but I cannot finish without mentioning Tom Hardy. Seeing him in other films I trusted his acting and boy was I correct to do so. At times he didn't seem all that scary, but those times he was I got chills.I was happy to see a normal sized person with extreme strength. (No Batman and Robin Bane here) This is the calculating Bane I recall from the comics. Once again changed slightly to fit in the Chris Nolan Universe. This Movie, as long as it was, could have been longer. The almost 3 hour movie seemed to fly by for me. For those that complain bout the slow parts don't ignore them, they're there to push the story along so pay attention. If you're a Batman fan put it in your collection and enjoy it often. If not a fan watch it, enjoy the film, then buy it. Rumors of an ultimate edition sounds promising but until then I will enjoy the one I have. I bought the DVD version but if you have an HD set and Blue Ray set I suggest going that route to really take advantage of the IMAX format which is near double the size of your standard 35mm print for you aficionados. If the new \\"Man of Steel\\" movie is even close to this version of Batman I'll be adding that to my collection as well.n of Steel\\" movie is even close to this version of Batman I'll be adding that to my collection as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched this show from the very beginning and feel it is one of the best shows I have seen in quite some time.  In a world of &#34;reality&#34; TV shows with its crass, classless aims, Downton transports the audience into a more refined time, where manners, dignity, honor and integrity mean something.  The cast is wonderful!  You will not be disappointed!
145470246X|5.0|I really like this book. The instructions are clear and concise, the photos are great, and I can't wait to make some these designs.
1416955070|4.0|This is an enjoyable book, a fast thrill ride of a story.  Yes, this book has won a LOT of awards:  * 2010 Georgia Peach Book Awards for Teen Readers  * Finalist for the Locus Award for Best First Novel of 2007  * An American Library Association Teens Top Ten Award winner, 2008  * 2010 Georgia Peach Book Awards for Teen Readers  * Winner of The 2010 Abraham Lincoln Illinois High School Book Award  * Winner of the 2010 Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Reader's Choice Award  * A Texas TAYSHAS title 2010  * Shortlisted for the 2010 Evergreen Young Adult Book Award]  * Shortlisted for The 2010 Colorado Blue Spruce Young Adult Book Award  * Shortlisted for The North Carolina School Library Media Association Young Adult Book Award  * Grand Canyon Reader Award Nominee (Teen) 2010]  * Iowa High School Book Award Nominee 2009-2010  * North Carolina YA Book Award Nominee 2009-2010  * New Hampshire Flume Teen Reader's Choice Award Nominee, 2010  * Nevada Young Readers' Award Nominee 2010  * Ohio Buckeye Teen Book Award Nominee, 2009  * Oregon Young Adult Network Book Rave Reading List Title 2008  As well as placing on the New York Times best seller list.   There is a lot of explanation done within the story, which is necessary, considering the main character, Clary, was hidden from everything that could have been considered her rightful life to protect her.  There are a lot of interesting concepts and heroic battles.  So, as such it is an interesting book and a great start to the series.  Also, I can definitely see why this is being released as a movie (opens August 23, 2013 in the US) [...]  and, a movie I am seriously considering seeing.   Having read the book, I can see how this is trying to be like Harry Potter and why Hollywood is hoping for another successful franchise.  Unfortunately, I fear this will go the way of Percy Jackson and the Olympians.  This book, while pretty good entertainment, is not great.  While handling a very serious life, only allows the briefest glimpses of wonder and beauty in passing.  Mostly this is about strife, fear and betrayal.  One thing sadly lacking, seems to be a sense of humor and wonder.  I would not want to enter this world.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter's favorite thing about this game is that it lets you ride the horse in competitions while other horse games don't allow you to do that.  She also likes that the game allows you to &#34;buy&#34; things and that you can make feed and feed your horse.

B0037QGRZG|3.0|I never saw this movie when it first came out. So, I thought I would give it a try given all of the &#34;woven into the fabric of America&#34; stuff that came out of it. You know..&#34;wax on, was off&#34;, etc...I even remember people back in the 80s telling me how really good it was. I guess our standards were a little lower back then. The bullies in this movie are horrible actors. They &#34;overact&#34; every scene and have really bad 80s hairstyles. The only good thing about this movie is the way the &#34;Karate Kid&#34; learns from Mr. Miagi. (or however you spell it) Other than that, its a very predictible plot chocked full of annoying 80s music. As I watched it, I was trying to accept it for what it is... A predictable, corny, 80s romp through teen puberty with a life lesson thrown in for good measure. Compared to some of the trash that is coming out these days, I guess it's not all that bad.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|too intrusive. wants too much access to my personal info, and i see no reason this app should need it.

B005LAII80|5.0|I did not see Dredd in theaters because the title had 3D in it and the trailer looked awful.<br /><br />That was a mistake.<br /><br />It is a 80s action movie made nearly 20 years later and it is fantastic. I easily consider this one of the best action movies of 2012. There is no sentimental storyline for Dredd, no character development, and he does not save the wold. Instead, Dredd gets a call. Dredd responds to the call and bad stuff goes down. Dredd kills people. Essentially the movie has lots of action with beautiful cinematography.<br /><br />Watch it. You won't regret it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|G5 realy knows how to rope you in. Just finished the trial and I'm hoping that the full version is as good or better.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love a game that makes you think. Recommended this game to several people who have bought the Kindle Fire
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is quite an interesting book. The writer really has something important to say. At the beginning I felt somehow bored by the two many examples of real life cases. But after that I found that there was quite a lot of excellent in depth analysis. The good thing also is that we do not see exaggerations. It is the truth as the writer sees it without using these kinds of exaggerating words that takes from credibility. The book includes some excellent ideas for introverts to use in life. It gives them insight that helps understanding themselves, and it also helps extroverts how to understand them and interact with them.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|At times I thought it was going to get exciting but it never really turned the corner.  I was  slightly amused by this book but was happy to have it end.

141659521X|4.0|This is an action, packed, \\"kill the bad guy\\" novel. None of this moral relativism nonsense.  Bad guys are bad and need to be put down.  The only thing that prevented me from giving the novel 5 stars was the traitor, Rickman, wasn't all that believeable.  Why did he defect?  To live in the wonderous land of Pakistan where a man's dungheap is his castle?  Cetainly there was no ideological basis for his defection.  I just couldn't buy it.  Aside from that, I loved the book.  It makes me wish we had leaders with balls who actually believed in America instead of the sick jokes we have at present.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun but everything is way over priced and it is very laggy. Other than that it is very good though

B00A11AN6O|4.0|This was wonderful book written by a very skillful author.  As an attorney and retired judge, can attest to the accuracy of the many difficulties of the private practice of law as well as arragance and ego driven nature of some trial judges described in this very interesting and  well-written story. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading courtroom fiction. However, I hasten to add that this has to be the most poorly edited book I have ever purchased for my Kindle. I have never seen so errors in simple things like spelling and punctuation. It was so bad  that it really interfered with the enjoyment of the book. I will certainly look for future books by this author and hope for better proof reading and editing.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Can't stand when you are listening to the radio and your favorite song comes on and just like the other 100 times they played it they don't tell you who its by or the name. Shazam!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought Nicholas sparks did a great job of developing the characters and making one feel the pain of abuse that many women go through and how difficult it is to get away from it.  I liked the going back and forth between Katie (Erin) and Kevin.  Sparks also did a great job with many of the twists just when you thought you had it all worked out.  Found the ending very interesting and was not disappointed at all.

B008Y1YJ90|3.0|This got great reviews and our family LOVES Christmas. I thought it was cute, but I should have rented it instead of buying it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After reading the first 2 installments of the Trilogy I had to complete it...I was actually a bit bored by the time I got to this book but it did offer some epic battles and capped off the story.  Whether or not I liked the ending is up for debate, I guess it had to conclude somehow...but I'll let you decide for yourself.
B009XTF8KQ|3.0|This movie itself doesn't have too much to offer that's new. If you've seen \\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"Rosemary's Baby,\\" you'll probably feel you've seen most of the manifestations in this film before.<br /><br />Except, instead of the exorcism being performed in the more generally familiar Roman Catholic tradition, here we see the dybuk spirit being driven out by a member of the Hassidic Jewish tradition. The performer cast to play this exorcist's role had actually been a member of the Hassidic community, lending some authenticity and unique interest to the proceedings. For the most part though, the possessing agent is a familiar character, right down to its ravening appetite for raw meat.<br /><br />However, there are reasons to get this film. There are two commentaries on the disc. The one by director Ole Bornedal is hypnotic and eerie. He doesn't talk a lot about the technical aspects of making the film. No details about \\"hand-held\\" versus \\"steady-cam.\\" Listening to him is like listening to a captivating storyteller around the campfire. In his softly advancing Scandinavian accent, he paces you through the film. \\"And now the quiet, and now the quiet.\\"<br /><br />Then there's a narrative from one of the film's associates about how he actually acquired a kind of dybuk (dibbuk) box, and about the frightening trail of circumstances that (coincidentally?) arose from his possession of it. This narrative is also scarier than the movie itself. It comes with warnings similar to the warnings movie producer William Castle used to tantalize his audiences with in his B-movies of the 1950's. When the dybuk box will actually be shown as part of the bonus features, a caution to the audience appears. \\"For your own safety, you might want to turn away from the screen.\\" It's \\"Homicidal\\" and \\"The Tingler\\" all over again - not as part of the movie, but in the usually blander commentaries.<br /><br />On a more realistic plane, the movie has an appealing romantic subplot and stars two handsomepeople - Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. So there's eye candy for both male and female viewers here. These stars portray a divorced couple drawn back together as they battle to reclaim the soul of their youngest daughter. Will they succeed? Will these beautiful people, who obviously still have so much feeling for each other, be able to sew their family back together?
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Addicting! It' s so hard to stop playing. I can' t wait to try the other games from this creator.Thanks for something new I can use to look really busy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my kids have this on their iPods, I wanted it for my kindle. I have been playing it almost all day! much beefed than the original! it's a must have game!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The book was a little difficult for me initially with the Glade language and being sort of in-the-dark on everything.  I also didn't really care for the Grievers for some reason.  Even with that I think that things get cleared up when they needed to and this introduces the characters and forms a good foundation for the rest of the series.  The overall book was decent, but it was by far my least favorite of the series...I would give this a 3.5, The Kill Order a 4 (I read this second), The Scorch Trials and The Death Cure 5's (I read both of them in less than three days).  Very entertaining series, and if you don't like the first book very much they got much better imo.

B002M9WW30|5.0|This Rocky collection for $20 on Blu-Ray? Heck yeah! I love the Rocky movies no matter how cheesy they are. They bring back so many memories. And even with the later misses in the franchise the entire series is still enjoyable. I like having the whole collection in one set on blu-ray. The quality is fine and it is definitely recommended.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|This is a good app, but there is no explanation of what the icons mean. I contacted Apalon customer service and was told that this info might be included with app updates at some future date. I contacted them again and asked if they could tell me what a certain icons meant, but they were unable to give me specific information.<br />Today I noticed that my Alarm Clock app (also an Apalon app) has a weather feature which includes the same weather icons as Weather Live, along with an explanation of the icon.<br />I would have rated this app 5 Star if Apalon customer service would have been more helpful.
030758836X|2.0|Whether or not one will like this book depends heavily on what one expects out of narrative fiction of any genre.  Me?  I'm a Plot Girl.  First, last, always, the plot's the thing.  I can suspend disbelief if need be; I will let an author set up the rules of his/ her own world without question.  In return, I expect the author to have set his/ her story up with a well-constructed, clever plot, capped by a satisfying, suitable resolution, or I will pretty much rue the day I ever picked up the book.<br /><br />I pretty much rue the day I ever shelled out money for, and wasted time reading, \\"Gone Girl.\\"<br /><br />Without going in to too much detail, you get something of a shock at the beginning of Part II (\\"Boy Meets Girl\\")...and that's pretty much your narrative high point there.  Half of a 400+ page book is too long to spend on a denouement, with only a page or two of resolution - a highly unsatisfying resolution, at that - at the end.<br /><br />If it matters, the book is populated with characters about whom you will feel little more than indifferent at best, and at the worst, completely despise.<br /><br />If you haven't already succumbed to the hype, don't bother buying this book.  Borrow it from your library if you must, but even then, don't blame me for the hours you spent reading it that you'll never get back.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|This album is much more soul, funk, guitar, bass than the last. Even though I liked his last album, this one is more rock and upbeat.

1457514508|5.0|The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club by Duncan Whitehead is an entertaining piece of satire that chronicles a period in the boomer years of four women living in Gordonston, a suburb of Savannah, Georgia.  Revenge, jealousy, envy and vanity are the overriding themes from which the female boomers characters emanate.  The misquoted line from Shakespeare's Hamlet, \\"Vanity, thy name is woman,\\" surely applies here to Cindy and Carla while Heidi seeks retribution for her perception of misdeeds that happened over 60 years ago.  The fourth character, Thelma, is dying at the beginning of the story, but her zest for life is the antithesis of her three friends.<br /><br />The juxtapositions of their various stories create coincidences that are oftentimes comical and at other times, serious.  In this debut novel the author has done a masterful job of creating characters that we want to see again.
B0058O84G0|4.0|Very well written with a lot of attention to detail - makes history come alive. The characters are very realistic.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Great book from an interesting perspective. London presents a clear view of the simple, carnal pleasures of life. Highly recommended.

It appeared as a suggested purchase when I bought another CD.  I went to bed the first night I downloaded the MP3 version with it playing on my Kindle and in my ear in my iTunes.  Since I couldn't crank up the music loud enough on my Kindle, I went to the same song on my iPod, and danced in my bed until I wore myself out and fell back to sleep.<br /><br />DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS CD.  Get it now!
0765325950|5.0|I bought this for a gift.  I give it 5 stars because of the enthusiasm the one I got it for had.  He has read other books by this author and liked them very much.  This book has 909 pages.  From the jacket I learned Robert Jordan died in 2007 but fantasy writer Brandon Sanderson worked from notes, scenes and an outline left my Robert Jordan.  Sanderson consulted with Jordan's widow who edited all of her husband's books.  It is a sequel to Towers of Midnight.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i really like this app. it has great quality and stuff. the only reason i rate it 4 stars is because im not really into horses that much.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this game has good graphics and there is tons of things you can bulid and even though there is not all blocks on the app u can still have fun!!! I can give you some seeds for diamonds u need iron picks for them though here is one jpgaming dig straight down for where u spwan get the materials you need first and one more is 0.4.0 this u get gold and diamonds dig on spawn like the other. minecraft can be so much FUN GUYS OMG!!!!!!!!!!

B007IXWL2C|3.0|I feel lost.  Needed more details, left too much for my imagination.  Too many mumbles, tongue thrusts.  Not original sex.  I've done more sexting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app because the regular version is a very good game but the temple run 2 is the same goes for the regular version
B007N5YJYS|5.0|A fast moving thriller from the master of suspense.The scene with Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll in the hotel room while handcuffed is absolutely magical,and this Criterion edition is brilliant I have watched this movie several times since it arrived a month ago.I will be investing in more Hitchcock magic in the near future.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Riveting - exciting - touching- and sweet - great characters<br />Fast paced, smart, clever, and mentally challenging - a must read
B000SEGUDE|5.0|It would be an almost impossible task to truly encapsulate this book in a few short sentences. Suffice it to say I was utterly engrossed in the multiple writing styles (each according to its own epoch) achieved by Mr. Mitchell, not to mention the thought-provoking message.<br /><br />This novel will surely be seen by future generations as a \\"Classic.\\"
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I LOVE imagine Dragons!! I listen to them alllll the time! I don't even have a favorite song because they are all great!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE!!!!<br />GREAT GRAPHICS!!!!!<br />I GIVE THIS GAME A 5 STAR RATING!!!!<br />THIS GAME IS SUPREMELY ULITMATELY MORE AWESOME THAN ANY GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!<br />PLUS IT IS ULTRALY EPICNESS!!<br />PLUS IT IS ADDICTED!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this app so far. its got good graphics and fun to play. I hope it continuesnto be as good as it already is
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am enjoying this game. The graphics are amazing. I like that I don't have to be connected to the internet to play.
B004UID2LC|5.0|not only can I download those goofy scenes of animals, including those of the human species, I can also get instructional videos to enhance my intellect, I can feel myself getting smarter every day!
B00136NUG6|4.0|A blast from the past. I love those funky horns. And at $3.99 for 17 songs with clear digital sound, it is a steal!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I downloaded this game for my granddaughter and she loves it.  It took a couple tries to get it started, but it was worth the realistic graphics.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app because it helps keep track if my battery and I love how you can change the color if the battery.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Great sequel to a good game but for the kindle fire it needs to be overhauled! Super frustrating when you are making a record run and then the game crashes and you lose everything. The game needs to be debugged before it is worth playing.
B009R9WAZ8|3.0|Just okay.  I actually have enjoyed Ri Ri's three previous albums better.  There were only two clear hits on this album compare to at least 7 per each of  the previous albums a piece.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Wow,  I am blown away by this show.  It's like a 16 hour horror movie.  Definitely worth watching.  I wouldn't recommend watching it with your teen.  A bit too adult for that.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Easy to use, sync to phone/computer/kindle, especially considering that I downloaded it as a free app. Doesn't require a PhD in computer science to navigate.
B0077ZNCE2|1.0|Best two hour nap of my life.  I am impressed that someone was so able to channel the psyche of 14 year old kids into book and film format.  Give me back my vampires!!  The OC can't have them.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|All I can say is I love Les Miserables!!! It has been my favorite book since childhood and the movie rocks.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The show has twists and turns each episode. It is not horribly intense, just exciting and fun. I love the actors. They do a great job.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|AWESOME book!! Cannot get enough of Christian and Ana!! Read all three books n less than a week and have started reading book one again!!!!!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|ive only used it a couple times but so far i like it. cant figure out the alarm thou. still working threw all the sounds
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it. I'm 10 not an adult but my sibblings can not play my kindle so they cant play any of my games oh a bum for them
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Didn't live up to the first two starring Matt Damon. Jeremy Renner's acting career seems based upon being the poor man's Daniel Craig.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|Does a very good job running my desktop from my Kindle, albeit a bit slow.  Somewhat difficult to drop and drag and have not figured out how to do two key functions (like control/down arrow, etc).  But by in large a very useful app, which I use every day .
B006LSZECO|5.0|I found the book had twists and turns and didn't want to put it down. Very interesting and enjoyed reading this novel.
B000063UR2|4.0|REVIEW IS A REPLY TO BRETT D. CULLUM'S REVIEW, WITH PLENTY OF BLADE RUNNER BABBLE ADDED, IN FACT, UM, MOSTLY BLADE RUNNER...  BUT WITH SOME GOOD THINGS ABOUT BOTH LEGENDS...<br /><br />Wow... Jaw drop and drool...  Although I tend to agree with your summation of this Legend set (although, I think I like the Goldsmith/extended cut better, as, hey studios, I'm not an idiot- the additions add flesh and dimension, and, mostly I dig the undated feel that Goldsmith's score ended up giving this more timeless cut of the flick=== not that the US is lacking in it's more dreamrush charms [and hey, I do dig that synthy goodness, also]) I must strongly disagree with you on the Blade Runner comment.<br /><br />With Legend, I can actually appreciate both versions, although, they still seem to get off basically the same idea (although with differing speeds and tones-- I almost view the Goldsmith/extended cut as: THE MOVIE and the Tangerine Dream/US cut as the dream I had AFTER I watched the movie that night.)  But really, the differences between Blade Runners?<br /><br />Okay, okay-- between the 4 cuts! the change can appear \\"gradual\\" but the end result away from the original US theatrical with the narration and cheese ending to the last Ridley Scott take on his film is a real artistic and conceptual black and white difference.  One is: a movie, the other is: a film.  Dropping a hammy \\"detective noir\\" narration and adding, even a BRIEF dream sequence of the unicorn and later bringing said unicorn back at the end as a piece of Olmos origami is effing monuMENTAL in tone, concept, feel and statement.  Oh, and ONE WORD change that the US version 1 had between \\"father\\" and \\"f__ker\\" is also quite huge and meaningful and significant (to say the least the savage hacking that many of Rutger Hauer's lines, including the closing monologue, got).  I'm sorry to go all \\"art school fan boy\\" on you about this-- maybe it's been awhile since you've seen the different versions, and, after the initial dropping of the narration approach being a more obvious change and the subsequent versions and their slight, yet significant, tinkering I can see how some things might get muddled and lost--  but, IF--  you compare US cut 1 with the final statement, cut 4, you may be surprised about how much better, classy, meaningful, thought provoking these changes were.  Seriously, it goes from being a jazzy eyeball-fest sci-fi shoot-em-up into something more, something special, and, (somehow confusing me with PKD's take on what I'm guessing was US cut 1), WAY MORE IN KEEPING with the heady stew that PKD served up so well in his writing and Ridley Scott's impressions of where the story could go and what it could say or incite.  Verbal landslide, sorry.  Anyway, check it again and see what you think.dropping of the narration approach being a more obvious change and the subsequent versions and their slight, yet significant, tinkering I can see how some things might get muddled and lost--  but, IF--  you compare US cut 1 with the final statement, cut 4, you may be surprised about how much better, classy, meaningful, thought provoking these changes were.

B004F1F32A|4.0|this was a very good movie, with a lot of action. i will probably watch part two this next weekend, can't wait
B002ZG99QS|4.0|Slick flick.  Dug it.  Most beautiful thing I've seen in awhile.  Takes the classic Tron movie and develops it more, as it should, as the story and world of Tron, or \\"The Grid,\\" would have were it, y'know, um, \\"real.\\"  Delicious escapism and feast for the eyes.  Mid-level on commentary, more entertaining than \\"thought provoking.\\" Bridges was great, as usual, but occasionally a little irrationally \\"grumpy?\\"  I have some issues with a bit of his character, but overall, does a fairly entertaining digital Dude.  And speaking of \\"digital,\\" \\"young\\" Jeff (CLU): mostly convincing as a \\"character\\" if not always convincing as an animation (nevertheless, a totally laudable and worthy attempt at \\"creating\\" young Jeff from current Jeff.)<br /><br />To make it a more solid flick it could have had some more meat, but Tron was always more of a dream than any nailed-down idea needing freeing.  It's fast, yet knows when to take it's time, it's moody (although, for any Zelda fans out there, is it a little \\"Twilight Princess\\" dontcha think-- loved that) and delivers enough character, concept and variety to go with it's undeniable audio/visual genius.  Epic, beautiful, energetic, ethereal, classy, grand and thematically seamless-- nothing but top recs for Tron: Legacy.  Great Michael Sheen, better than passable Garrett Hedlund and catlike, innocent yet not naive, Olivia Wilde (loved the hair and the dark eyeliner).  Bringing in Boxleitner and Journey/Eurythmics an absolute plus!  Just fookin' cool somehow, despite it's connections, without buying in to \\"the industry of cool.\\"  Please make another one, and bring back Box and that devious Cillian Murphy!<br /><br />A word about my title...  when I was little I enjoyed the Tron movie, however, I did have this dream where my dad and I were in \\"Tron-world\\" and were being attacked by, well, the Cylons from Battlestar Galactica (what a mushy mash-up).  I was mad young at the time, but I still remember that dream and have a few \\"screenshots\\" from it.  Anyway, my dad and I barely held them off, and then I woke up, screaming.  ... ... ...  Heh heh.  To this day, eff you, Cylons!
B0031SU2Y2|5.0|Life is hard for many people, and there are those who, at great expense and personal risk, choose to flee for a different place.<br /><br />Is it different when you do it for love?<br /><br />A young Kurd is desperate to get to England to see his girlfriend, and to propose to her.  But he is caught, and is now stuck in France, looking across the English Channel.  So near, yet so far.<br /><br />And then he meets a Frenchman with his own problems in love.  Might they help one another?  Might they both crash and burn?<br /><br />Excellent movie, with a gritty flavor.  Recommended.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|Shakenbake...  I'm throwin' in with the \\"like\\" crowd.  The chorus to \\"Rise To The Sun\\" is probably my favorite thing in the last few months.  Name drop, that, trusty Jack White took them on tour (has he failed us yet?).  Reviewer Neil Purcell saddens me.  I hope the kids grow and rock.  Download this while it's cheap, or, download later when it's not cheap-- either way, you get a good deal.  Keep these guys employed, writing, recording and releasing some ballsy ovarian rock.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Would've gotten 5 stars if not for the horrible instructions.  I can work with minimalist instructions, but these instructions were so bad they actually made you do things that were counter-intuitive to the instillation.  Eventually I ignored them and just did what made sense.  Apparently this is a video for instillation, but I had my pc off at the time so I couldn't look it up.  Anyway, MUCH quieter than the stock fan on my phenom II X4 black, and runs about 50% cooler (also added a case fan).  Not only did my last fan make the case so loud that guests would immediately ask what hell that sound was, but my cpu would overheat when playing certain games on the highest settings.  This has remedied that.  For the price, I would recommend it to anyone that asked
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Page turner which is well written, suspenseful, and tragic.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I beat it on my fist try and afterwards i just wanted to scare myself and after like 3 times of letting him get me i turned around and didn't see him and for a little while i didn't see him but then i l looked over and he was walking toward me down the hill and i turned it off and threw my kindle on the ground. So scary!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love playing this game soooooooo much it is so much fun you should really get this game! it is a lot better then the original version.YOU SHOULD GET THIS APP!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed it. Never a dull moment. I can't wait to read the next book in the series. Well written.
B001AIRUOU|4.0|This Collector's edition box set is great.  I loved the movie and the box is really cool...Jack's head is actually 3D plastic you can touch.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Awesome, the movie makers did a great job with Bethany's story and the movie came to me in good condition...thanks
B002PEP4SC|5.0|A fun read. I will read another book by Castle. Entertaining plot and enjoyable characters. Left me interested in what's next for Heat and Took.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Bought for my daughter who is both fascinated and hooked on the television series. She's an aspiring childrens' author with hundreds of books in her library. Her views on this series contain words such as &#34;fascinating, intrigueing, thought-provoking and pure inspirational genius. She will get each season as it comes out.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|I like the fact the tiles move during the game. makes it more challenging to keep up with them... Good app.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|WOW!!!  I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!  I spent the weekend reading Bared To You and Reflected In You.  If you are looking for a series similar to Fifty Shades of Grey....THE CROSSFIRE SERIES is for you!!!!  This book was even better than the first.  There is no denying there are some incredibly sexy love scenes in this one. If you thought the first book was hot, wait till you read this one!!! Sylvia Day takes it to the next level with this one, it's going to be hard to top, but I have no doubt in my mind that she will blow us away with book three.  I can't wait!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Play all day and not lose money! You can spend real cash to buy more fake coins, but why? This is a lot of fun.
0425263908|5.0|I LOVED THIS EMOTIONAL AND EROTIC BOOK!!!!!<br />If you're looking for a book similar To Fifty Shades of Grey then BARED TO YOU is the book!!!!  Gideon and Eva are two emotionally screwed up, tormented individuals trying to find some kind of happiness.  Their relationship is emotional, intense and complicated. They're obsessed, possessive and jealous of each other. Add that all together and the sex is explosive, their love is sweetly intoxicating, their relationship is dysfunctional and stormy but when they're happy it's beautiful.  This is one of those books that I will keep thinking about long after I've finished reading it.
B00005MP58|5.0|I love this CD. It has Colin Firth in it and he is a marvalous actor. The CD was as it was discribed. It also got here earlier then the time said.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|here I am buying episodes....Goes to show there is a lot of good tv out ther for us to watch
B005K17RU0|5.0|gives you a quick and concise overview of the weather and forecast with pretinent details you'll need that day.  also has links to additional information like radar and sattelite.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Outstanding historical drama. Great story line. Actors are believable. Started watching and can't stop. I am a true Downton Abbey lover.
B004QL7K70|5.0|This movie makes me not ever want to have teenagers. Crazy stuff happens and I just want to make sure if I ever go out of town, to take my kids!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|At 70% of the way through, I already don't know how I'm going to stand the level of anticipation through the rest of book!  Usually this level of thrill only comes in the last 10 pages of a book....
B000EULJLU|5.0|I love tool. and this cd was great. Would deffently buy this again. Or would love to see them in concert!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Not much action in the way of shootouts, but the drama of still high. The writing is great and witty and the characters are wonderful.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best game so far I say they should make a 3rd temple run and have a straight path where you dodge jump duk and get power ups and have a power up at the beginning you have to find by winning a certain mission
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoy historical novels and this one added to my interest in the relationships of slaves with their masters.  The characters were well developed.  The chapters went back and forth between on Belle and Lavinia, which was an interesting way of doing it, however  the book would have been stronger if the chapters had been  more balanced. Overall a good first novel for the author. I enjoyed the book
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a great app to use. It lets me focus on what is playing and comes my mind down so I can get some much needed sleep. They have a huge selection to choose from. A noise for everyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is A W E S O M E. I  L I K E  It. It is G R E A T
1401322786|5.0|Another amazing book from Mitch Albom. My favorite author by far. I recommend all his books and am one of his biggest fans.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 4 year old girl love this app and can not stop talking about this game.  This is one of the best app.
B00005NOM0|1.0|The movie I was sent didn't play. Threw away packaging so could not return.miracle on 34th street grandkids were very disappointed
B007EE564U|4.0|The Last Man, Flynn continues with the tempo and intrigue, after having read all in the series in the last 60 days, I can only hope the next installment is not too far away.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I loved the original Temple Run, but Imangi Studios has some major debugging to do for the sequel. I played this on a friend's iPad; it woked like a charm. I loved it and couldn't wait for the  Amazon Appstore release (oddly enogh, I use this one instead of Google Play). However, when I first installed and opened it on my device, running a fully capable Andoid 4.0 system, the app did nothing more than display their logo. Then, when I went to my homescreen, it had replaced my wallpaper with that same image. I had to redo my wallpaper. Closing the app restored the original wallpaper, but this continued to happen every time I opened it. Restarting, uninstalling/reinstalling, etc. had no effect. I am thoroughly disappointed with the new app, as I would love to be able to play it. Developers, please keep working on this version- it has tons of potential awesomeness. (Also, please forgive any typos, as this is a touchscreen. I do proofread, but I'm human too :)
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars cause I'm not much of a race car fan and didn't too much enjoy all the race car analogies. However, the rest of the story is very good. The ending is especially heart warming and leaves you feeling a sence of completeness. I would definitely recommend this book!
B002SJKWZ4|3.0|Purchased as a gift. Step son says he loves it. Lot of fun when guests are over. Some motions are hard to catch onto.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I may be biased because I LOVE Nicholas Sparks but this is truly is one his best!!! An ending you really won't see coming!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Loved this book! So meaningful and inspiring! Everyone should read this book, it is very eye opening and insightful about our lives and the world live in.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great book. Loved it and didn't want to put it down. Had a good plot and fairytale romance
B00B2V66VS|5.0|To me this is a awesome game and i would totally recomend this game for like teen  and ages 4-20 my brother who is 19 is playing it right now so yea thats why i would recomend it for i think my brother just played a trick on me about the alphabet he said that the letters e and t went home so i dint get it
B0083Z614S|5.0|Loved the book.  Reading it with my 3rd grader right now and she loves it too! A must read for all ages.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Half way throiugh the transmission the movie rebooted afor the second time and when it came back the HD transmission was lost. I paid for HD.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Another wonderful collection of classic old music by Buble and is wonderful &#34;throw back&#34; style.  This CD and the Michael Buble Meets Madison Square Garden are two you have to have in our music collections.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|My husband thought this would be funny and I was hesitant but finally agreed. Within 20 minutes we both didn't want to watch another minute.He told me we could watch anything else. Not funny just dumb movie. I guess of you ever wanted your teddy ruxpin to come alive you might be mildly amused.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|Perhaps this may be the best collection of Michael Buble music put on a CD.  It's played weekly around our house.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Great App, easy to use and allows me to view and share my photos. I recommend this app for anyone.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|Addictive. What else can you say about the actual dvd, it's a dvd. Can't figure out how to do sub titles
B0066WJLU6|5.0|My daughter and i both love this ap!  the flashlight is very bright & easy to use.. probably my favorite ap of all.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great, fun game for all ages! If u don't have the original temple run, I would recommend buying that for free, first, due to this game being more complicated, but fun!!!!!! Temple run never had my kindle fire lagging, etc. This is much harder than the first, but that just makes it 10x more fun!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Works great on my Motorola Razr Maxx & iPad.  My 6yr old daughter and I have endless fun with this game!! I like the minor changes from previous Temple Run.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so damn good!  Another one I couldn't put down.  It just goes to show you you can't believe everything you hear about someone.  After Sky finally got Dean to open up, they found out stuff that will surprise everyone!  This is a must read!
B0037QGRZG|4.0|This is a great movie to own.  I was going through a list of movies to dispose off, and came across this one.  I decided not to, popped it in the Bluray player, and had a nice family time with my wife and son watching this movie.  I am going to keep this, despite the fact that the transfer to Bluray is not satisfactory, for a classic movie like this.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved this book!  It just goes to show you how close families can be.  I laughed and cried.  Couldn't put this book down.  It is a must read!
B007HO392S|5.0|Probably her best CD yet.  The only song I don't care for is track 8 so I'd say it was well worth the money.
B000G759LW|5.0|I love Christina, and own all of her albums. This is my favorite of them all! I love the whole retro vibe. There are also some amazing songs for instance \\"nasty naughty boy\\" gives you the feeling that you are in an old 50s style bar or burlesque lounge listening to her sing these extremely sexual lyrics. \\"Candyman\\" is a very fun song and \\"Aint no other man\\" is fun and catchy! Some of the other songs such as \\"mercy on me\\" are powerful and amazing, and \\"save me from myself\\" stays true to the 40s and 50s style of the album! This whole album is very creative! And In my opinion this was Christina's best era! She channeled Marilyn Monroe a lot and she looks so classy, glamorous, and beautiful! She does the \\"pin up girl\\" look very well! And of course her voice is amazing!
B009X01D9U|5.0|Terrific case! I like the ability to set up either vertically or horizonally. It's well made and is easy to use.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I usually sleep with a fan now I dont have to.  Its easy to use. I have it shut off at a certain time and there are several sounds to choose from.  Love it.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|This movie shows gratuitous drug use/ abuse, drug paraphernalia and profanity that was unnecessary. Not a good message for families, many who will sucked in with a teddy bear as the second banana in the movie. Thought it would be funnier, as I normally like Mark Walhberg's work. Should have known better with Seth McFarlane at the helm. Would not recommend seeing this movie.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Avengers shows that you can make a good comic movie, remain true to form, and not descend into campiness. Rather than pull the team of heroes into the &#34;real world,&#34; as the Dark Knight Trilogy does (and those were a brilliant take on Batman in their own right), the Avengers recognizes from the outset that the audience has come expecting a superhero-filled all-out brawl. And that's what you get.<br /><br />And no review would be complete without mentioning that Hulk absolutely steals the show here.
B0014YPEI4|3.0|When we first got this allosaurus, we were blown away by the details.  Between my daughter and son, we literally have over 100 plastic dinosaur toys from both Papo and Safari.  In all cases, I have been happy with the durability of the models, with the exception of this one.  Although the dorsal spikes give this dino a really cool look, they fall off easily, even with the most delicate play.  Most of the head spikes fell off after my son put them in his back pack.  This was really surprising, as all of our other Papo toys have held up extremely well.  Like any boy, my son can get a little rough with his toys, but all the papo dinos still look brand new after a couple years of play.  Papo usually makes really cool and durable toys, but it looks like this one was not really meant to be handled much.<br /><br />Now, I used to collect action figures when I was in college (like the McFarlane toys), so I know the difference between toys that are meant to be displayed and ones that are meant to be played with.  Papo describes its mission statement for entertaining kids on their own website.  What I love about Papo is that they never sacrificed durability for details.  Allosaurus is the lone exception.<br /><br />With that said, Allosaurus still looks pretty cool, even with many of his dorsal spikes gone.  My son still plays with it plenty and no other problems have occurred.  The paint job is really well done and durable, and you really have to see the details in person to appreciate the artistry of this toy.<br /><br />So if your kids are dino fanatics and above the age of 10 or more, I would get them this toy as a model to be placed on a desk.  It is definitely worthy of display. If they are younger (and appreciate the quality), I would recommend any of the other Papo dinos.  Especially the new running T-Rex, which is 5 stars all the way.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This Free App has given me numerous hours of fun and entertainment without costing an arm and a leg, GREAT.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Really enjoyed Life of Pi.  It was very thought provoking and at times made me squirm a lot.  The story flowed well and kept you reading.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|This is a really good album.  Enjoyed all the songs and listen to it all the time.  Recommend it to everyone
0547995660|5.0|I was assigned to read this book for an English class in 7th grade. I am so happy I had an amazing teacher who truly knew a great book when she read one. I owe so many great reads to her. This is such an interesting book. It really takes you into a whole other world. I have to read the othe books too.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|It was more magic than I expected but I really enjoyed the book. The imagery was described beautifully. I could really picture it.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This is the best weather app. Definately worth the money. love to check it first thing in the morning with my cup of coffee
B009O2XY12|5.0|great little game like all the angles you have to do .<br />keeps me entertained while waiting in line .<br />nice that you can stop at anytime.
B0001I562I|5.0|We lose the essence of the young mind in fantasy,  I thought it was a great film.  Wish there more like it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|There is nothing wrong with this game. I mean it, really nothing! I mean a perfect game. It's so addictive.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love the purple and I love the stand-up feature especially as well as the band that keeps the cover shut.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Such a good read. Heartbreaking and promising all at the same time. I was with Lu the entire story. Great book
B000WQWPKA|5.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. The special effects are really brought to life in the blu-ray version, and with a bit of surround sound you'll be french kissing the ground thinking aliens are blowing up DC in no time!
B00846REIS|3.0|It was just okay, nothing special. It's VERY similar to Fifty Shades, which I happened to like better than this book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Gives you an insight in the mind of somebody who thinks about life and what is around him and it made me think as well. Very good humour, very Indian I thought.<br />In brief a fantastic book, certainly worth reading.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love how it leaves you wanting to jump right into the next book.  I can't wait for the movie to come out for this book as well.
B008TRUDAS|2.0|I hated the premise of this book with a teacher having a relationship with his student. It was a betrayal of trust and an unbalanced  relationship with the teacher holding all of the cards. Could she have been more vulnerable with just moving to Michigan after the death of her father and he's literally the second person she meets? Plain yuck. Didn't find it romantic in the least and won't be reading the sequel.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's an okay kind could have been A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN THAT®©™~~%¡THANK U SO MUCH PLZ HELP ME KK
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I don't know where to begin. This flippen book was AWESOME :) it was so well written & I can not wait for 'Walking Disaster' to come out in April! The characters are fantastic! The story line was well thought out & carried awesome though out the book never one did I have to I have to think about who was talking or were they were or anything. Author is awesome :) how many time can I say this book is AWESOME, MUST READ!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I personally LOVE this game but if you get sick or dizzy easily by 3D or vast movement this may not be the game for you but either way try it ITS FREE
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee tiiiiiiiiiiiiiii lol the best game ever I can play dis game all the long lol but subway surfer is fun to
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really loved this book after I got into it. It took me a while to get it to it because the setting was so depressing. Also I felt as if it took a long time for any action to happen, it kept going on and on about district 13.
B000FC10WU|5.0|Dame Agatha Christie was an amazing storyteller. Her writing is clear and understandable. You feel like you are right there watching the action. This entry is no exception.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|TED gives a long list of inspirational talks on many subjects. The ones I have listen to were first rate with an interesting point of view. I would highly recommend this app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like card games that challenge you to make choices that may make or break your game. The ease of play increases my satisfaction. Who wants to shuffle and deal real cards?
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Purchased this as a Christmas gift for son. He watched every DVD in the set and said that they were in perfect condition and he enjoyed the story.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my favorite card game on computer. Now I can take it with me wherever I go. Good job!
B0025KVLVA|5.0|This album makes you realize how impressive is the sheer ~volume~ of excellence and remarkable diversity that one band can produce.  Thanks forever, Fab Four!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I have heard of the mania surrounding this game in the past. I am getting to like it too but it isn't my favorite
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I will never travel agian with the use of the TripAdvisor App. It tells you where you are in relationship to where you want to be. It gives you awesome tips for cities that are unfamiliar and it's all written by people who have stayed there, not a travel magazine where the writer is getting paid to write a good review. This is a must have app.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I really like the look that the cover gives my kindle. Just like a book. My daughter complimented me on it this weekend.
B007TK77QE|5.0|This was one of those books I didn't want to finish. There is little to compare with the Harry Potter series, except to say a good writer writes good books. J. K. Rowling clearly knows people well and has the ability to create very true to life characters across a wide range of personality types and social strata. They ring true through and through. Darkly funny, tense and a wonderful expose of the seething depths lurking beneath picture perfect Pagford. Highly recommended.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This seemingly simple past time is addicting. The premise is simple but as you progress to more &#34;pipes&#34; the difficulty is challenging.
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|Girl power ..... allows for both genders to be a part of the train world of children.  I highly recommend.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|The google search board makes it easier to zero in on items of interest. It helps you to find those things you need, more quickly.
B004HHKFIY|5.0|Cute smile... good for a firm handle on the train.  They run smoothly on the wooden tracks... even on corners .
B0049J3QNG|5.0|My son loves Toy Story and I love that it streamed flawlessly with wonderful video quality! Its such a delightful movie! Thank you for not charging an arm and a leg to rent it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I wasn't sure what this book was really about when I purchased, but it's surprisingly good. it's smart, funny and a little dark. winning combo!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When first saw temple run, I thought it looked boring. I was VERY wrong! This game is super fun and enjoyable. I would advise getting before it starts costing money to download. I clap my hands to Imangi Studios.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I Enjoyed this game excellent story great graphics lots of places to visit and solve mini puzzles that are challenging you have to think a bit.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Everyone says it's so great. Honestly...IT SUCKS. It's hard to control, when I trip and the monkey is behind mme I can't see, and the app doesn't open 1 out of 10 times. I hate it and am going back to the original temple run. Who ever made this obviously has no clue what they are doing. The graphics are cool, but not worth keeping the game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun and realistic this thing is making me write more words so...<br />you get to feed and take care of horses, dress  them up in the clothes that you buy, and do tasks to help them and improve.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one of those reads that has a lot of emotion.  You are happy, sad, worried, fearful, mad and confused.  Great story and written wonderfully!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play this game on my kindle and I pod and thus bane is my addiction. I get frustrated when I don't make it to a mine mainly because in my oppinion the mines are the best parts.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I feed this amp with the line output from my Tivo box and it works beautifully. It adds no noise that I can discern and it drives my headphones with all the power I could ever want. I mainly use the headphones when I want to listen to musical programming in the evening without disturbing my neighbors. It would be a good buy as an amplifier for just one set of headphones, but the fact that you can drive four, each with its own volume control, is icing on the cake.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|It is not as interesting as his other novels.  It reads more like a young adult book with not much meat to it.
B00942S4OY|1.0|I listened to them via a broadcast from  Tokyo. Let's see- they can't play any of their instruments, they can't sing and their lyrics are best suited to the night time fantasies of 13 year old boys. How can anyone take them seriously? When the \\"band\\" members grow up- if they ever grow up- they will surely be ashamed of the trash they created.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|they keep me reading till the end can not set them down once I start them that can lead to many long hours in the chair.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Intriguing story line.  I didn't know what to expect with the whole Abraham Lincoln thing.  The screen play was well written and the plot with its twists and turns held up quite well.  Many of the historical aspects of the era was played out in the storyline.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  Entertaining and action filled.
B00AW735QC|5.0|I love the series as a whole.  The Asylum is a great and interesting backdrop for anything scary and twisted.  The show just keeps getting better and the surprises and twists are in every show!  Well written, with no loop holes, the plot doesn't just roll on,it builds and develops with each new addition to the cast.  New cases, both good and bad are added and the thought of some of this really happening in Asylums makes it feel real.  You get such a great blend of science fiction, added on top of a typical ghost and horror movie, it's great.  Add the fact it all takes place in an Asylum for the criminally insane and no wonder it's a hit!  This last episode really got me more than the others and I cannot wait for the next episode and seasons!  Highly recommended!!!
B000FAGGWQ|5.0|Any sw fan will enjoy this behind the seens look at how the saga was put into motion, good to rewatch as the possibility of a new set of films is ahead of us, nice to revisit. DVD was great quality
