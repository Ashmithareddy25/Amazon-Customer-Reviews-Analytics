B00006LLNU|4.0|This is a great album for any fan of expirimental or slow and moody rock.  It's not for people who are impatient or in a hurry.<br />+ These guys have a great sound, emotional, real, and relaxing.  The lyricless songs are powerful, interesting and beautiful.  The reason I say the album exudes tranquility (and is potentially boring) is because it forces you to slow down... You can't listen to a 10 minute song if you're in a hurry to get somewhere or do something.  This album forces you to take a breather from the hectic pace of every day life.  Great for anyone who is willing to set aside 10 minutes or an hour just to sit and listen to slow and beautiful music.<br />+ I think Sigur Ros has done a really cool thing with this album by making the case and cd booklet a beautiful part of the complete work of art rather than merely a commercial means for delivering the album.  The idea of being able to title and interpret the songs myself, as well as just the beauty of the images and the texture and smell of the insert booklet, really turned me on to this album and made me want to take the time to listen to it closely.<br />- The only thing I don't like about this album is that the tracks are of inconsistent quality.  Although they are all good, tracks 2, 5, and to a lesser extent 6 and 7 aren't as good as 1, 3, 4, and 8.  I want to give this album 5 stars but I just dont think it's consistent enough in quality to be a 5 star album.  I am, however, excited about the future of Sigur Ros.  I think they will only get better and better.<br />( ) is not recommended for people who don't like slow music or who have a short attention span<br />( ) is highly recommended for anyone who likes experimental music, wall-of-sound type rock bands, or slow or emotional rock, or anyone whose mind is open to listening to music in a new and different way.
B0000683DH|4.0|If you do,then get this movie.  <br />The Good:<br />It adds a lot of little scenes that explain small gaps in the storyline.  The digital sound and quality of the DVD are better than the original.  I enjoyed the extras with included interviews.  This is a very nice 2 DVD set.<br />The Bad:<br />I found the original cut to be more fast paced and entertaining than the director's cut.  Don't get me wrong, based on my rating it's obvious this is still a good movie, but those scenes were removed for a good reason, they slow the movie down or add unnecessary campiness.  One example is during the famous engine room inspection.  Kirk refers to a crewman (related to Scottie) as a tiger.  Come on...that sounds so out of character.  I've enjoyed the television show and movies for years, but calling a cewman a tiger?  This is along the same line as the scene where Kirk discloses to Spock how he told David about being his father.  Spock's reaction is definitely out of character.<br />Conclusion:<br />If you have the original, keep it and this set for the extras.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|When I first heard \\"Me Against The Music\\", I thought Britney had lost it.  But as I listened more and more, I can't get the track off my repeat button.  It is a great example of the whole album.  At first it seems radically different from Miss Spears' early works, and it is.  It is one of teh best albums I've heard in a while.  All Britney's previous efforts had classic songs(Baby...One More Time, Born to make you happy, Ooops!, Stronger, Slave, etc.), but also a lot of filler, great filler but obviously filler.  This album is 100% chock full of irresistable, catchy pop/dance tracks.  From \\"Me...Music\\" to \\"Boom, Boom\\" to \\"Showdown\\" to \\"Outrageous\\" to \\"Brave New Girl\\" my butt hasn't stopped shakin'.  Even the ballads and slow-jams work.  \\"Breathe On Me\\" and \\"Early Mornin'\\" put you in an unescapable transe that delivers great aural pleasure.  \\"Touch of My Hand\\" is a beautiful track. So what if it's about masturbation, it belongs up there with the greatest pop songs of at least the last 25 years.  \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\"  are hauntingly beautiful and earnest.  I can't get enough of them, and Britney's voice sounds spectacular.  But the best track has got to be \\"Toxic\\".  I beleive it's actual musical intoxication because when I hear it I can't but dance or tap or just move with sheer happiness.  It's the best track I have heard in a long, long time.  I have literally put that rack on repeat for more than 24 hours at a time.  It is classic Britney and classic pop music.   If you don't get the hint by now, \\"In The Zone\\" is a fantastic album.  Whether you're a Britney fan or not you should own this album or at listen to it to see what you're missing.  A+++++
B0000C1733|5.0|This cd is great. Its called greatest hits because it has greatest hits from the bands whole career. And who was the genius that said its not greatest hits if you dont have the song &quot;Don't Stop&quot; on there. Obviously you are a great fan considering the song is called &quot;Can't Stop&quot;. We have a genius on our hands
0780021150|5.0|In 1931 Berlin, 8 children have fallen victim to a murderer.  Suspicion abounds on the city streets, and the police have very few leads to follow.  To expand their search for the killer, the police raid the dens of the underworld, infuriating the crime bosses.  How could the police think that a murderer of children would be included in their ranks!!  They may be theives and prostitutes, but even they wouldn't stoop so low as to harm a child.  In an effort to rid themselves of such a terrible mark, the criminals take it upon themselves to track down and to bring their own form of justice this terrible person.<br />&quot;M&quot; is Fritz Lang's first &quot;talkie&quot; and is filled with great camera shots and very little sound.  Sound is only used when necessary, giving this a great mix of the silent era and the new age of the talking pictures.  The story is wonderfully told and displays one of the finest performances of Peter Lorre's acting career.  His portrayal of the child killer is chilling and beautifully acted.  An incredible film.
B0000013G9|4.0|My Girl Gorup of All Time is TLC, But my favorite song on the <br />CrazySexyCool alubm is Creep, Warterfalls, and Diggin On You,<br />But is still hot on the strees right now, Go cop that alubm in <br />stores now Bkace in The day baby.
B000002WPI|4.0|I'm not a really big fan a rap, I'm more into really heavy hardcore and punk. As a matter a fact, this CD is the only Rap CD I own! I love the rawness, bare bones production. Just right in your face. The martial arts connection is brilliant. I've always been a fan of old school kung fu movies so seeing them adapt it to their rap personnas is very cool. I've heard some of their solo releases (Method Man, Ghost Face Killah etc..) None of them match up to 36 Chambers. SIDE NOTE: Dont buy any of their re-released Kung Fu DVDs. They're bad dubbed VHS copies in most cases, stick to the Crash and Celestial releases)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I fell in love with Firefly from the very first scene when it was briefly on the air on Fox (idiots).  Fox did every thing they possibly could to doom this show to failure.  They refused to air a perfect pilot until several episodes later.  Instead they made the creators write an episode (The Train Job) over a weekend to air first.  The episode worked but there were too many people that were missing the necessary exposition that the pilot provided.  Then they stuck it in a terrible timeslot.  Congrats Fox you ruined the best original television series I have ever seen.  <BR>Whether you are a fan of the brilliant Joss Whedon's other projects (the fantastic Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel) or not, I wager you will still love Firefly.  The direction, writing, and performances from a brilliant ensemble cast are flawless.  Joss Whedon is the only person I know of that can effectively entertain fans of drama, action, and comedy simultaneously in the same one hour episode.  You will laugh out loud, shed tears, and be on the edge of your seat in any given episode of Firefly.  <BR>The creators have put the episodes of Firefly back in the order they were meant to air.  There are also three great episodes included that fox never aired.  Anyone that watched the series when it aired will see what a mistake fox made in refusing to air the episodes the way that Joss and Tim intended.  <BR>Many reviewers have suggested that Firefly The Movie is a done deal to come out in 2004.  This is not true.  It is possible, but by no means a certainty.  The best thing people can do to help get the movie made or (like in the case of another brilliant but doomed fox series Family Guy) get the series back on tv is to buy this box set.  You will not regret it.  <BR>And be on the lookout for Tim Minear's new series (oh god it's on fox too, it will never make it) Wonderfalls.
B000003TSP|5.0|This CD confirms for me that the 90s was probably the greatest decade for music in terms of freshness, creativity and just plain good music! I love this CD every bit as Dummy. Everything that people  found wrong with this album I loved! It's darker, wierder and the vocals are less polished and more organic at times.  Portishead and Morphene's &quot;Good&quot;  are the perfect CDs to listen to back to back.
B00005JLXE|5.0|This movie was about a little kid named Matt Mettock(Ben Afflict)<BR>who became blind. He's Dad was killed by the Kingpin of New york<BR>and Matt then swears to bring Justice to the streets and becomes<BR>Daredevil. I think this was the best film marvel made,you really<BR>feel for the characters. This was realy good.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I have to say that I love this album. It is hypnotic and I know I can't stop listening to it. This is a soundtrack to a surreal dream, dark and beautiful.<br />I just traveled 3,000 miles to see Radiohead in concert and I have to say, one of the best concerts I have ever been to. If you like this album, listen to Hail to the Thief by Radiohead. You will be consumed by that album too.
B00005JM02|5.0|What can i say? All i heard was raving reviews but no way was i going to see this at the cinema. A group of 17yr old lads out to see Finding Nemo? ... i dont think.<br />But lucky me- a friend lent me their DVD afew months later and all i can say is- amazing. The film is excellently made and is funny throughout with some deep characters. Not only is the film amazing, but the extras on this DVD are incredible.<br />No matter who you are, No matter how old, No matter what background. Finding Nemo will be a prized possetion in your DVD collection.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I have to say that Radiohead is one of my favorite bands. I just traveled from New York to London to see them. I love this album. It is great for sitting in a dark room and it is great as background music.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard Bring Me To Life I was hooked on Evanescence. Their sound is so original and just plain cool! Their songs, although they may sound similar to each other, have different messages that are very deep and full of feeling. Lead singer Amy Lee can really belt it and her voice just goes with the music, and I cannot get over the way she sings the songs, it's like she really knows what she's singing about.
0812550757|4.0|For those familiar with Ender's Game, this is a must-read, though it is most certainly not the same high-action level. A quieter, even more subtle read than EG, with some plots choices I didn't favor. As a Speaker for the Dead, Ender is no longer known as &quot;the&quot; Ender, but as his true name, Andrew Wiggin. A new alien species has been discovered on another planet. The &quot;piggies&quot; are most likley intellegent, but due to government laws and clashing cultures, there is an enormous misunderstanding. Ender comes out to Lusitania to speak at the death of one of the researchers, but when he does, he uncovers much more than he could have anticipated...A slower story, with almost all new characters in a new world, this will definatly change your perspective. I would have appriciated some of the old gang back, and a more familiar world. I didn't feel the emotional attachment to these characters that I did in Ender's Game/Shadow, but it was still a well written book, and definatly worth the time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|So when you finally get to the last of the 3 new episodes, and you finally get to the end of the 3rd new episode(new to the US, the UK got them last year)and that cliffhanger sets you up for the big &quot;awww, dang it!!  Now what??&quot;<br />You check out Amazon.com's sister site, the Internet Movie Database and find out the the Firefly MOVIE is currently in PRODUCTION!!  Joss Whedon alludes to one in the commentary, but what a happy suprise for such an incredible series!!  The characters draw you in with each story they have, and what secrets still to be told.  Yes, it's a Sci-Fi Western....SO??  I dont see too many people lining up to get the 1st year of Survior now do I??  Firefly is interesting, and dramatic, and funny and a great watch.  My two cents, thank you.
B00006J3T4|4.0|I think it's fair to say that if you play a CD and love it right off the bat, you'll soon tire of it.  Conversely, if it takes a while to grow on you, you appreciate it all the more.<BR>That's what I find with Mark Knopfler's music.  I had owned \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" for about a year before buying this album and \\"Golden Heart\\".  I must say that I was a little disappointed in these new albums at first play because I had grown to love \\"Sailing to Philadephia\\" and they didn't seem to be quite as good.  Since then, I've played these new albums quite a bit and they are steadily growing on me.  There are nuances to Knopfler's music and lyrics that don't come over at first but grow upon you with repeated listening.<BR>His diversity of talent and musical style probably accounts for why he doesn't get much airplay - it's hard to categorize him as one thing or another.<BR>While Dire Straits was a great band, everyone has to grow and move on.  There's nothing sadder than seeing old rockers beating out the same music they did 30 years ago - with half the energy and voice they had. I appreciate the fact that Mark Knopfler continues to search out new ways to express his creativity - which I think he has done excedingly well on this album and \\"Golden Heart\\".
B0000AQS0F|4.0|The crew of the Spaceship Serenity, a Firefly class cargo ship, did not deserve the short run on TV. The series is a true western, set in space (please ignore the small time/distance problems of REAL space and just enjoy the action). The DVD set presents the series in the correct sequence, not the way that it was shown on TV, that way you get to meet the characters in order and don't have to say &quot;what was that?&quot; and &quot;where did he/she come from?&quot;
0393051587|5.0|This handsome volume has everything: both the original text and Dicken's very different &quot;reading&quot; version; fascinating introductions to both texts; hundreds of illustrations and photographs, superb annotations throughout; and a generous and heartwarming editorial spirit in keeping with the story itself.  You may think you &quot;know&quot; A CHRISTMAS CAROL from the many movie, television or theatrical versions; or, once-upon-a-time, you may have read it.  But until you read this version, you won't really &quot;know&quot; A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  Michael Patrick Hearn's love of this wonderful old story shows in the care and detail he has lavished upon this edition, in the documentation he has provided and in the absorbing notes which enrich the story and our understanding of it.  This book is required reading for everyone who loves Christmas and literature.
B000002LIX|5.0|I must disagree with the editorial review. This is the best &quot;Jane's Addiction&quot; album, but not by far, and if he thinks &quot;Three Days&quot; is overlong and bogged down, I suppose he thinks the same of Led Zeppelins &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;, and The Doors &quot;The End&quot;. Anyway, this would be my pick for &quot;Jane's&quot; best, though &quot;Nothing's Shocking&quot; is almost as mindblowing. It starts ironically with &quot;Stop&quot;, which if a powerful song, musically and lyrically. The next three all rock, and &quot;Been Caught Stealing&quot; is of course the most popular. Then side two (or track 6), begins with the moving epic &quot;Three Days&quot;. It's delicate, and heavy, and amazing, all at the same time. &quot;Then She Did&quot; and &quot;Of Course&quot; are good, of course. And it closes with the beautiful &quot;Classic Girl&quot;. To me, this album is the epitome of &quot;alternative&quot;, and &quot;Jane's Addiction&quot; probably kick-started the movement more than most other bands did. Easily 5 stars.
B000002LGW|4.0|This is probably one of the best live albums I've ever heard, and I've heard it probably 500 times. It also serves as a 20 track  &quot;Depeche Mode&quot; best of the 80's collection, since everything is pre-&quot;Violator&quot;. This includes the big hits &quot;People Are People&quot; and &quot;Never Let Me Down Again&quot;, as well as the softies &quot;Somebody&quot; and &quot;Question Of Lust&quot;, among others. Also here is the excellent sing-a-long closer &quot;Everything Counts&quot;, which ended up on &quot;The Singles 86-98&quot; collection as well. But really every track is great, and makes &quot;101&quot; essential for any &quot;Depeche Mode&quot;, or synth-rock fan. Highly recommended.
B000002H97|4.0|This may not be &quot;Metallica's&quot; best album, but there's no doubt that it's their most popular, most accessible, and probably still best selling. They became huge, right at a time when the alternative craze seemed to kill-off other metal bands. The success of this album came mostly from it's numerous singles. This includes the monster hit &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;Sad But True&quot;, &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot;, and the suprising but excellent ballad &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;. Whether you consider this to be the end of their best years, or the beginning of their worst years, you've got to like this album. Now where's that &quot;Best Of&quot;?
B0000508U6|4.0|I remember hearing &quot;Yellow&quot; on a plane home from Ireland in 2000, and knowing that when I got home I would get the cd. There is obviously something special about &quot;Coldplay&quot;, and when Chris Martin sings, you can feel it in your head and your heart. I can understand the comparisons to &quot;U2&quot;, &quot;Starsailor&quot;, and &quot;Radiohead&quot;, because the music really is passionate and emotional. Other popular songs are &quot;Shiver&quot;, and the gorgeous &quot;Trouble&quot;, but I also like &quot;Don't Panic&quot; and &quot;High Speed&quot; just as much. Overall an amazing debut. The only thing more impressive than this album, is that &quot;Coldplay&quot; followed it with an even better one.
B000002H70|5.0|With so many excellent albums from &quot;The Cure&quot;, it's hard to say which is the best, but most people think this is. It's definitely the most consistent in terms of mood and quality songwriting, even over the &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; and &quot;Bloodflowers&quot; albums, though similar to both. And as great as this is for it's few singles like &quot;Fascination Street&quot; and &quot;Love Song&quot;, it's even better for it's moving and epic tracks like &quot;Prayers For Rain&quot;, &quot;Untitled&quot;, and especially &quot;Same Deep Water As You&quot;. I could put that one on repeat forever. Another popular and amazing song is &quot;Pictures Of You&quot;, recently used in a TV commercial. So if you're looking for diversity, check out &quot;Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me&quot;, but if you want probably the best pop-goth album of all time, it's &quot;Disintegration&quot;.
B00005UKKF|5.0|This girl is realy talented and you can see it when you view this DVD!<BR> She knows how to put a show on!<BR>Her performances are amazing if you are a person that wants performances worth watching get this DVD!
B00005RDAF|5.0|I love this video it has a few of her Music videos,a short making of her movie Crossroads,Britney taking poses to the camra and much more this would make a good gift!
B00006RU5B|3.0|I think that they could have done a lot better.  Thro alot of the songs the lead singers voice(the name is out of my head) sounds like he is on helium.  If you are excpecting an in your face head banging albulm this isnt for you.  These people aren't Rage Against the Machine.  I really never was a Soundgarden fan but was a RATM fan.  So i decided to by it. it was an average cd.  One for the person who likes average rock.  The best song is Gasoline.  You can defiantly tell that this is Rage and Soundgarden mixed together.  I hear farmilar riffs from both of the bands.  So I mean itz up to you. It really isnt that bad. but it defiantly wont be a classic.
B000051VWW|5.0|this is one of my all time favorite albums.  sade's smooth voice, matched perfectly with the soulful and moving beats make this a classic.  while the first single, by your side, got played out, king of sorrows and lover's rock never get old (and she's amazing in the video for king of sorrows!!!) if you're into soul/r&amp;b this is a must have album.
B0000026VZ|4.0|When I got this, I was expecting classic rock, but when I played it, I got much more of an 80's sound. But, that's not a bad thing, especially since I knew and enjoyed alot more than I thought I would on this cd. Besides the big hits here &quot;Rosanna&quot;, &quot;I'll Be Over You&quot;, and &quot;Africa&quot;, this includes &quot;Hold The Line&quot;, &quot;Pamela&quot;, &quot;99&quot;, and &quot;I Won't Hold You back&quot;. The majority of this disc should be familiar to any radio listener. Plus, what's not so popular here, is still pretty good too. Overall, this collection might not be perfect, but it's still definitely better than &quot;Super Hits&quot;.
0385504209|5.0|I thought this book was excellent.  I was entertained every step of the way.  Just fabulous.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|No fooling around here...Just a super-funked-up and very tastefully done live-music DVD. The Chili Peppers are at their finest and funkiest. They make you appreciate what sight and sound was intended to do for us music/video fans. The set is mostly from their most recent CD's but don't let that fool you!<BR>What sounds mature and graceful on Californication and By The Way looks/sounds even better as soon as the first note hits your ear. The DVD is mixed with as much energy as the Irish fans that seem to know every word of every song and aren't afraid to sing them. The band has not let-up either...most bands would have walked off the stage after playing half as many songs as this...and felt good about it. Cudo's to the boys from LA and thanx for showing the world AGAIN what real people with real musical talent who actually play their instruments can do.<BR>-DAV-
0811806405|5.0|The book is comprehensive and very well written.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is a must have.  The performance is nice, enjoyable, and anything good you could think of.  From the minute, I've view it from the T.V. i couldn't leave my seat.  What can you expect?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|&quot;Firefly&quot; is a great show with a great ensemble.  ALL of the characters are interesting and worth caring about.  ALL of the actors give first rate performances.  Great writing, story, lighting, photography, music, set, costumes, effects...  Top notch production all around.  Quality.<BR>  The DVD set presents the show as it should be seen:  Pilot followed by the episodes in order; and in widescreen format.  It does make a difference...<BR>  Having it all on DVD is one dream fullfilled.  Next would be a return of the show and/or a feature movie(s).
B000056QE5|4.0|When I watched Mary Poppins for the first time in six years, I was reunited with some of my favorite songs, which I had forgotten.  I was immediately compelled to buy the CD.  Now I can listen to the music anytime without dealing with annoying VCRs.<br />  The sound on this CD is fabulous and the songs are just as great as they always were.  From the delightfully bouncy \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" to the beautiful lullaby \\"Feed the Birds\\", this CD is something everyone in your family should enjoy.  In the little paper that comes in the front of the CD case, lyrics to every song are included (the ones to \\"Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\\" are somewhat incorrect.<br />  Also included on this CD is a roughly 17-minute interview with the Sherman brothers, who wrote the music.  (I haven't listened to it yet, I'm too impatient)  It's a definite plus, but I think the best five things on the CD are \\"Sister Suffragette\\" (#2)  \\"Jolly Holiday\\" (which is #7 and really romantic)  \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" (#8) \\"Feed The Birds\\" (#12) and \\"LEt's go Fly a Kite\\" (#17)  If you liek MAry poppins, get the CD.  It's a big plus from annoying VCRs.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I was going to do a long review on what makes this movie so great, but that would exceed the 1,000 word limit so I'm going to tell what I don't like about National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. The one thing I would change would be the scene where the girl from the store, Mary, dives into Clark's imaginary pool. They don't show her topless and that has always annoyed me.
6301868684|5.0|This is not a film for uptight people who can't see the form of art beyond this film's less-than-subtle depliction with sex, drugs and violence.  This film deals with a box of subjects ( drag queens, gays, prostitution and gang rape ) that makes the \\" decent \\" of society run the other way.  It's one film I suggest people over seventeen see at least once.  The director's woven the novelist's tale into an unforgettable book flattery. This is one of the best film adaptations of a book I've ever witnessed.  The actors will leave you breathless. The film doesn't present one dull moment. The movie is full of intense emotion and reality.  Take it like it is if you can handle it.
6305907145|4.0|Come on! No one expects a movie to be completely faithful to the novel. The other reviewers are right, Fanny Price from the movie is nothing like Fanny Price from the novel (maybe that's for the best, though!). But this is another person's interpretation of the book, not Jane Austen's. It's a very good movie--holds your interest and raises some intriguing issues that Jane Austen, perhaps, only hinted at. <BR>Watch the movie, as Luna said, for itself, not because you think it's going to be an exact replica of the book. <BR>~A
B00005JMTN|2.0|Near the beginning of Big Fish, Edward Bloom, the hero of the movie, is telling the story of how a giant visited Ashton, the town where he grew up.  The giant, whose name is Karl, is not created by a computer; he actually has gigantism, and is clearly not a professional actor.  His completely unaffected performance is one of the few charming things about this movie. <br />Anyway, Edward and Karl go off to the city together and Edward of course takes Karl to the circus, where he's bound to be star.  Here's the part that bothered me, the part that I think gets at what's wrong with this movie.  Danny DeVito, the ringmaster in the circus, plops down a contract in front of the giant and says, \\"Do you know what `involuntary servitude' means?\\"  The giant says, \\"No,\\" and DeVito smiles and says \\"Good!\\"  This gets a laugh from the audience.  Now, this character had already earned my affection, so I wondered what was going to happen to him in this exploitative circus: how's he going to end up?<br />But they never tell us.  They skip to the next tall tale.  And this happens again and again: oddities are used essentially as props, and then taken out of the story until they're convenient again.  The Siamese twins could just as easily be talking Rhesus monkeys, or four armed men juggling robin's eggs: the movie doesn't care, it just wants weird.  Clearly the studio thought, Circus freaks, let's get Tim Burton - but his old creations like Edward Scissorhands had life and compassion behind them.  Here's Burton working with someone else's book and screenplay, and I can tell he doesn't care about any of them.  Even the human characters are there only to learn lessons or impart them, and a few scenes had emotional resonance only because the actors were so good: the scene in the tub with Edward and his wife doesn't feel real because the characters have earned our sympathy, but because Lange and Finney convey something authentically beautiful in the wider world - the deepening love of couples as they age.<br />When I got up at the end of the movie, severely annoyed, I noticed that the girl next to me was crying.  I didn't understand her reaction, since everything about this movie struck me as false.  Maybe the tears were a surface emotion, or Big Fish reminded her of something authentic in her life.  I imagine plenty of reviewers will gush about this movie, but just like everyone cried at the end of Titanic, and you now see shelves of the movie unrented in Blockbuster, this film's phoniness will catch up with it eventually.  It isn't fair to ask every movie to become a lasting part of someone's emotional life, but when a movie pretends to cast a net of generosity around all of its characters and treats them with either callous indifference or vapid sentimentality, it makes me upset.<br />Clearly, I didn't react to Big Fish in the way that some other people did - I suppose it's good for a few laughs and a quick cry - but these are disposable emotions brought out by a disposable movie, one that will dull your appreciation for the lovely moments in life instead of intensifying them.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly will take over your mind and soul if you simply watch.  It is the best show ever.  Period.  Fox totally screwed up by cancelling this incredible show.<br />The plot is excellent, the characters are even better.  Don't miss this fantastic DVD!
0385474547|1.0|I was forced to read this novel for my high school honors  English class and was bored from beginning to end.  The language of this book is hardly worthy of being read in middle school, let alone high school.  It flows as if a fifth-grader had written it.  The plot?  Nothing more than a collection of rigid, cardboard figures who can't seem to care about anything but growing yams and beating their wives.  Toward the middle of the book, we see the emergence of the 'evil' white men who brought that horrid religion, Christianity, into tribal life.  Oh, the horror!  I am always perplexed as to why public schools always find it necessary to force the students to read works that only make whites sound as if they were an incarnation of Satan.<br />Bottom line:  This book is a complete waste of time.  Hopefully you won't be forced to read this dribble as I was.  Try something that will actually expand your vocabulary and open your mind.
1567184855|5.0|This book had a profound impact on me and on nearly everyone I've given or recommended the book to.  I'm so surprised I'm writing the first review.  If you are on a spiritual path - this is a must read.  It is similar to Many Lives Many Masters in the messages within but covers many case stories and focuses on life between lives.  It reminds or opens the reader to looking at his/her life from a broad spiritual perspective.  I've bought many copies of this book to give as gifts.  You can learn more about me at [...]
0743243307|1.0|I don't know much about Bangladesh culture or what it's literature should portray.  I do know that this author received a wealth of hype when the book is filled with &quot;cliche after cliche&quot;.  Sorry Monica.  I do believe there is some talent there.  But if you don't know the culture you are writing about, do extensive research, research, research.  Perhaps your characters might have been more authentic if you, yourself, really knew/know the culture.  Do you?  I don't feel you do--at all---nor do I feel that whatever research you did helped you know enough.  I don't know about Bangladesh culture, but I do know cliched, super fast, quickly rushed writing and poor research.  I hope your next book lends to your readers a lot more of what you do know.  Brick Lane is not terrible, but it's too darn formula-ic, wrought with passages that really don't say anything about the characters other than that they are A,B,C,D'ish.
B00009V7T2|5.0|de-loused in the coamatorium canonly be described with one word: indescribable. there's simply no word for how great this cd is. when listening to it, you don't really know what you like about it, that is, you can't tell yourself what you like about it. all you really know, is that you like it, it's like a gut feeling, like your whole body absorbs the music and is energized by it. tracks 1 and 2 work so well, together, you hardly notice the transition. but the best is track 3, roulette dares (the haunting of), if you don't find yourself completely intranced by this song, you might as well reconsider breathing in and out. there's nothing else like this music. get it!!!!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|this band has been getting a lot of hype, and its well deserved.  a friend let me listen and i was hooked.  the orchestrations and the choirs are amazing true, but metal fronted by an amazing woman voice, who saw that as being something great?  this album is well worth the money.  Its nice to finally hear someone doing what they want.  for the rock, for the music.  something new, something fresh.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|No matter what you think of her.  She is one of the greatest voices of all time. No one else that I have heard can SANG as many standards as she, can so poignant, pronouncing every syllable so clearly yet effortlessly with power and compassion.(ex. Oh Emanuel.  God Bless her she sends chills through my body and I really can't think of another artist who can do this maybe old school Aretha.  But God knows he surely put some powerful cords in that petite frame of her's.  And I can't think of anyone else who can honestly touch her to put it honestly and frankly (not even Mariah) yea Mariah  she can hit some high notes but sanging with the depth, power and passion that Whitney does is all together a different story.  And I think it is credible coming from me because I don't review music based on my personal likes or dislikes of someone's personal life.  I will say one thing I hope Bobby will take a GOOD Look at what he has next to him and wake up to a new day, BECAUSE WHITNEY HOUSTON IS ONE SANGIN B......(And I mean that with the UTMOST RESPECT but I got to keep it real.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was entralled by this show from the first episode and crushed when the show was cancelled. I haven't seen anything like it on TV and fear I may never again.<br />If there's one joy that resulted from the sadness of not seeing the show every week, it's the fantastic DVD set they've put together. The show's magnificent writing, brilliant acting, and visual effects that seem SO REAL are preserved forever!<br />The set offers the show in letterbox format (something US viewers were denied) and allows new viewers to see the show in the original order (not the scrambled order originally aired by the network).<br />I bought 3 sets the day I found out it was available and I'm back to order a couple more for gifts!<br />If you like Science Fiction, Fantasy, Adventure... scratch that! If you want to see a show that will surprise you at every turn and have you laughing, crying, and cheering, buy this DVD set today!
B00008H2LB|3.0|I find it quite interesting to see all the reviews with people saying that LP are metal or hard rock. They are neither but they are an excellent angst rock band. Although LP is aimed at teens, a 22 y/o bloke like me can get a lot off. their not original, their not gods of metal but for what they do their is no other band that can beat them.
B00009MGGP|5.0|This is high stakes political drama like nothing you've ever seen before.  I can't wait to see the other discs in the series.  Brilliant acting from Ian Richardson and the entire cast.  Reminds me of Shakespeare's Richard The Third a great deal.  A must see television show.
B0000DZTIW|4.0|While not as authentically eastern as Crouching Tiger's Soundtrack, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is nevertheless rousing and emotional while retaining an Eastern flavor.  Like the movie, it is not purely based on Japanese tradition, however, the japanese instruments are authentic and played to perfection, and the score captures the moments of Zen that cruise experiences in the film.  These moments of &quot;stillness&quot; make it a great study CD or for anytime you need to focus your mental energies.<br />Finally, the melodies are simplistic, but it is very pleasurable to hear Zimmer and the orchestra play them in so many different tones, evoking feeling from the notes each time they are played.
B000002KB8|4.0|Cream, The Who, Led Zeppelin and the Jimi Hendrix Experience laid down the roadbed for what would become heavy metal, but THIS is the album that laid the heavy concrete down.  Metal begins here, bar none, with \\"Deep Purple In Rock\\" not far behind.<br />Listening to it in this overproduced techno-digital-MP3 age, it is difficult to believe that this album was recorded in just a few hours on an eight-track studio in England thirty-odd years ago.  Quality will always show through and stand the test of time.<br />This is actually an odd mixture of songs and extended jams, which shows the era it comes from.  The later, tighter song-oriented Sabbath is on view in the title track, to a lesser extent in \\"The Wizard\\", and \\"N.I.B.\\" (which doesn't stand for \\"Nativity In Black\\", but was named after drummer Bill Ward's beard, which resembled a pen nib!).  In addition to guitar, bass and drums, you'll find harmonica and even a Jew's harp on this album!<br />The Maestro, Tony Iommi is the greatest guitarist in heavy metal history, if not all of rock n' roll history.  To hear what this left-handed man with mutilated fingers could do with his down-tuned Gibson SG and stacks of Laney amplifiers is amazing and a joy to behold.  He even shows his first forays into classical guitar on \\"Sleeping Village.\\"  He really was the driving force behind the band and had every right to keep the name after the Ozzy years.<br />Terry \\"Geezer\\" Butler was Sabbath's \\"wild card\\".  Not only was he responsible for bringing the bass guitar to the forefront like no-one else before, but he was also responsible for the majority of their lyrical output.  His mixture of rock-solid bass lines and fast-fingered melodic work would influence legions of HM bassists to come, such as Iron Maiden's Steve Harris and Manowar's Joey DeMaio.<br />Bill Ward was a very different drummer from his contemporary and good friend, the late John Bonham of Led Zeppelin.  Bonham was a solid timekeeper.  Ward was more of a percussionist in the jazz/swing sense, which can be heard to good effect on \\"Wicked World.\\"<br />Then there's Ozzy.  I've often wondered why he sounds so much lower-register on this album than his keening whine on his later work.  He is no singer in the strictest sense of the term, and the band would go on to work with much better vocalists (Ronnie James Dio, Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Tony Martin) but he did put personality, if not creativity, into the early Sabbath work.  I've often scratched my head as to why this guy is so popular.  He was fun in concert when I saw him, and of course he always knew how to pick a backing band, but he is still no singer and that's what shaves a star off this review.<br />If it sounds like I'm being uncharitable to Mr Osbourne...well, I am.  I'm still smarting from his fiasco of removing his original backing band from his first two solo albums and not owning up to it.<br />I also own a (horrible - no top end, distorted recording) import cassette of this album with \\"Evil Woman\\" (boogie cover song) in place of \\"Wicked World.\\"  I only bought it as a curiosity and rarely play it.  This version of the album is just fine...more than fine, in fact...ages like fine wine...
B000050HTO|5.0|Bob Dylan is perhaps the best songwriter who ever walked this earth. Artists such as The Byrds, Jimi Hendrix, and Eric Clapton were all heavily influenced by his music. I bought this \\"Essential Bob Dylan \\" collection today and it has all his great songs including the 60's hits \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\", \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\", \\"Mr. Tamborine Man\\" (who the Byrds made into an international hit), \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", the seventy's hits, \\"Lay, Lady Lay\\", \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\", \\"Hurricane\\" onto the 80's and 90's like \\"Silvio\\", \\"Not Dark Yet\\" and \\"Times Have Changed\\". On this collection you get 30 songs total which is probably all the Bob Dylan you'll really ever need. Dylan who must be close to 60 years of age or older still continues to amaze people with his unique songwriting talents. Buy it and enjoy the talents of this superstar poet/songwriter.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have read some nasty reviews about this album 'Fallen', and I am here to say that this is a fresh album from a rock group. Now when a friend told me to get the album, I listen to a couple of songs, and I was hooked. What made this CD good is Amy Lee's vocals, they are fresh from the pop world, and Evanescence brings a dark and haunting album to the music industry. <BR> Now two of the songs are slow and they show Amy Lee's talent as a singer with 'My immortal' and 'hello' with the piano instead of hard rock rifts. <BR> Now this album is not for everyone because people have different taste in music, but give it a chance, and you might like it, if you dont, then that is ok too. But dont let this CD pass you by, this is so much better than any other pop albums out there that depict sex or drugs, it just brings real human emotion and how someone can relate to it (like myself). There were times where I do cry on the album, with 'My immortal' and 'hello' because these songs were heart touching to me, and I am glad that this band made a album like this.
B0000019PA|5.0|I love the entire theme to the album. Mangum's words are so thought provoking, surreal, and occasionally haunting. No matter how odd the lyrics might seem, Mangum chants them with deafening conviction. Also, they surpass a single interpretation, which I think is the great thing about the entire album.  <br />Both uplifting, and disheartening. At times, I find it horrifying, and other times more comforting than any other record I own.
B000002J03|5.0|Great stuff for sure.<BR>Unlike The Rolling Stones, who gave credit when and where due, for songs that they covered, Led Zeppelin PLAGERIZED Whole Lotta Love; Real title: You need love. They also PLAGERIZED The Lemon Song; real title: Killing Floor.<BR>Jimmy Page is a GREAT guitarist, Robert Plant sounds like a girl.<BR>GREAT CD!
B00009V7T2|5.0|There are a handful of albums that come around through the years that you can't put down, that you listen to endlessly, and that you compare all others to.But throughout a persons life there is an album or two that totally changes the way they think, the way they see things, and what they expect out of music. For me, Deloused in the Comatorium was this album. The members of the Volta have managed to blend funk, pshycadellica,jazz, and amazing guitar playing into a seamless hour long musical orgasm. From the opening contration-like sounds, to the finale where lead singer Cedric Bixler (former singer of At the Drive-In) sings the question &quot;who brought me here&quot; with such passion you want to answer him, it is evident that The Mars Volta isn't your ordinary band. Essentially, DeLoused is a concept album about a childhood friend of Omar and Cedric's who, throughout the course of his life attempts suicide through shooting rat poison which causes his limbs to shrivel, and causes his body to look like a road map. As a result he slipped into a coma, when we awakes he is still filled with the same suicidal urges and eventually ended up taking his life by jumping into rush hour traffic from an overpass, in the city of El Paso. This story is so important to understand because as a tribute to his legacy the two former member from ATDI wrote this album about a fictional character Cerpin Taxt. The albums story takes us through his adventure which parallels that of their friends. As you listen to the album i truly feel that you can have a great insight of this mans life, and the pain he went through. This is by far the greatest album of 2003 and perhaps the last 10 years. You are foolish if you don't by this now.
B0000DD7NL|2.0|I WAS NEVER REALLY A BIG ALICIA KEYS FAN, BUT I DO ENJOY SOME OF HER MUSIC.

IT HAS NOTHING TO IT. &quot;YOU DON'T KNOW MY NAME&quot; IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS! WHEN THAT SONG CAME OUT, I THOUGHT THE CD WOULD HAVE MORE TO OFFER BUT IT DOESN'T. I HAPPEN TO LIKE &quot;DIARY&quot; BUT THAT'S IT! THIS CD WAS A COMPLE WASTE OF MY TIME.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Errr.. What happened to the other reviews on this I am sure there were more reviews. Anyway I love this collection. I loved Alien which annoyed me by freaking me out despite the fact that it is over 20 years old and the alien frequently looks fake by modern standards. I still get an adrenaline thrill from Aliens despite the fact it has less action than most modern action thrillers. I didn't like Alien 3 and hated alien resurection.<br />  So why am I giving this 4 stars? Well I love filmaking as much as I love films and this is an excellent view of what went right and wrong vs what was intended. I can see clearly why Alien 3 was a disaster waiting to happen and why Jean was the wrong man for Alien ressurection. I find that information invaluable.

B00005JM0B|4.0|Interesting that the three Terminator installments have come about a decade apart from each other.  The first came out in 1984, the second in 1991, and this third one in 2003.  After the very successful first film, the series exploded with the sequel, a film which was better than the original (very difficult for a sequel to do).  The second movie introduced us to some different special effects, as Arnold was now the good guy, and the new villain was made of &quot;liquid metal&quot;, and could morph himself into anything he touched.<br />Now, in this excellent third chapter, we have a similar situation.  Arnold is again the hero, with a villain who is more advanced than him.  This time it is a woman(Kristanna Loken) who can not only morph into what she touches, she has a right arm which can turn into just about any weapon you want, and she can control machines remotely.  The goal of the second two movies is the same, kill John Conner or those associated with him.  <br />The movie is missing Linda Hamilton, as Sarah Conner, and real life husband James Cameron as director.  Edward Furlong as John Conner in T2 is Nick Stahl.  Furlong is not missed at all.  Stahl does a credible job with John Conner as a late teenager who thinks the work he did in T2 has saved the world.  Wrong.  Claire Danes plays a veterinarian who gets caught up in the madness and who may play an important role later.<br />The absolute highlight of the movie is an early chase sequence involving all involved.  Danes and Stahl are in a pickup truck, Arnold is on his customary motorcycle, and Loken gives chase in a huge crane and destroys half the city.  At one point she drops the crane and wipes out an entire side of a road.  There's so much carnage it's funny.<br />This brings us to the conclusion, which I will not reveal.  I will say that while some sequels leave open the possibility for another installment, this one all but demands it.  The ending is logical and unlike most Hollywood productions, nothappy.  It is subdued, but appropriate and I congratulate the filmmakers for this conclusion.  In short I am looking forward to the fourth film.

B00005N83M|2.0|Okay, so Jennifer Lopez isn't exactly Miss Diva. She has no talent as an artist. Let's admit it the girl can't sing. It impresses me that even though she can't sing she's still popular, but I guess it's the same way with Britney. However, I must admit that some of her songs are good. However, this album gets annoying over time. I used to like Love don't cost a thing and Play but now I always skip these tracks. <br />Favorite tracks worth listening to is: I'm real, Ain't it funny, Come over, Dance wtih me, and That's the way<br />Other good songs are remixes such as: I'm real (Murder remix) and Ain't it funny (Murder remix and It's gonna be alright (Remix). But for these tracks you'll have to buy J-Lo the remixes. This album is not that great it's just okay. J-lo is a great dancer and actress but she lacks vocally. She should just stick to acting however, she still has the hits to keep her going. I guess is one of the reasons why I bought On the 6 and J-Lo
B00005JM02|5.0|A film by Andrew Stanton and Lee  Unkrich<br />I finally got a chance to see Finding Nemo.  After all of the hype, and all of the box office success, I know what the big deal was all about.  Simply put: Pixar makes great movies.  Finding Nemo is a lot of fun to watch, and has some of the most beautiful animation I have ever seen.<br />The story is rather simple.  Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a Clown Fish.  Marlin is the single parent of a little clown fish, Nemo (Alexander Gould).  Marlin is a very over-protective parent and while Nemo is away at school (clever, no?) he is taken by a scuba-diver.  This is the branching point of the story.  The movie switches back between Marlin and Nemo.  We see Nemo taken away and what his life is like in a fish tank.  We also see Marlin's quest to find Nemo and bring him back home.  Marlin has a huge adventure as he tries to rescue Nemo.  He meets up with another fish, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), and together they track down Nemo.  Dory is an interesting fish, as she has a limited short term memory and keeps forgetting things.  Together they deal with sharks, jelly fish, pelicans, and sea turtles and everything feels extraordinary and fun.<br />Fun is the bottom line with this movie.  It is simply a lot of fun to watch (for children of all ages) and the animation is simply stunning.  Finding Nemo also features the voice talent of Willem Dafoe, Alison Janney, Stephen Root, Brad Garrett, and Geoffrey Rush.  I would like to highlight the work of Ellen DeGeneres.  Her voice work was part of what made the character of Dory for me.  It was a funny character, a sweet character, and perhaps the most sympathetic character.  Dory was a lot of fun (like so much in this movie) and is probably my favorite character.  I would recommend Finding Nemo to anyone (and everyone).

He deserves a whole lot more because I think he made this movie good. (O:
B00006LLNU|4.0|... is how I would describe Sigur Ros' music. This album is not so much a departure from Agaetis Byrjun, but an advancement. The use of electronics works in their favor, and actually gives their music a more organic texture. Truly an original band, Sigur Ros released one of the best albums of 2002 with their release of &quot;( )&quot;. The first four songs might just be the most beautiful thing ever heard by human ears. The great thing: they are just as good live.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I first heard DT back in the early 90's when the only saving grace to the crap hairband stuff coming out was Marillion. I really remember how impressed I was with the playing ability of the band - from musicianship standpoint they were just amazing. But I really was annoyed with how they took the crap cheezy hairband melodies and then inserted the brilliance... I gave that album away since I couldnt listen to the whole thing just the instrumental sections.<br />Ok, so flash forward to 2003 and I read a guy's post on a PF here at work:<br />-new Dream Theater album, very very heavy and excellent!<br />Intrigued, I ask to borrow the disk for a day of listening. Probably the best hour of listening to new material I've had in 5 years.<br />DT does kinda go back to the NuMetal genre to grab the heavy grooves and chunka chunka guitar sounds that are so popular, but I dont think Limp Dickstick or others in that genre could ever put together a NuMetal song in 12/8 or mixed time sigs that DT succeeds in doing. Yes it's a bit derivative but they take it and extend it past anything out there right now. LaBrie's vocals were always a source of issue with me just because they're too pretty for the music, but with the production they definitely have grown on me. He's tried to toughen them up and for the most part succeeded. Especially the layered minor 7th and minor 3rd harmonies a la Alice In Chains, LaBrie is finally coming up to the rest of the band in his presentation. To be succinct: John Petrucci is just freaking amazing!! With sections where Portnoy and Myung are right in the speed metal groove a la Master of Puppets and Kill Them All, Petrucci just flies on the guitar making everyone else in metal look to be a pale pretender to the craft. I wish I could play like that but I would need about 10 cups of coffee every hour just to hit that intensity level.<br />Portnoy and Myung are typically brilliant, with Portnoy playing that big huge stupid work of art Siamese Monster kit of his and Myung chugging out ripping bass work supporting Petrucci and Rudess. You cant have a decent piece of music without solid rhythm track, and these guys give it everything and more.<br />Probably the only criticism I could have would be Jordan Rudess' playing seems hidden by the fact that his lead key sounds all sound like guitar - too close to Petrucci's sound to make it out on first listen. But after a few listens I found to my astonishment that what I thought were guitar lines were key solos and ... well that's all needs be said.<br />Bottom line: excellent musicianship, only one song seems weaker than the rest otherwise a brilliant concept album from start to finish. Any Prog Rock or Metal freak needs this in their collection.his and Myung chugging out ripping bass work supporting Petrucci and Rudess.

078681859X|5.0|As I've said in previous reviews, if you're going to set your book in England and have as a main character a young boy learning the art of wizardry, you've guaranteed yourself a comparison to Harry Potter.  With The Amulet of Samarkand, Jonathan Stroud can proudly say, \\"bring him on--wands at 15 paces!\\".<BR>  With so much pallid fantasy out there, Amulet is a breath of fresh air, told in a witty, original voice within a well-constructed plot and structure focused on two complex characters.  Amulet is set in an alternate England ruled by magicians whose powers come from their ability to conjure demons.  The society is beset within (by a resistance movement of \\"commoners\\" as well as by the murderous in-fighting among the ruling class magicians) and without (at war with Prague).  Nathaniel is a young magician's apprentice who, after being publicly humiliated, seeks revenge via the demon Bartimaeus and a powerful talisman--the book's namepiece.  By the time the book closes, it will involve murder and mayhem, betrayal, the attempted overthrow of the government, ancient (and I mean ancient) grievances, several tense chase scenes, various escape attempts, political commentary, the searing intensity of unassuagable guilt, and more.<BR>  Despite all that is crammed in here, the plot moves along briskly for the most part (this despite its complexity and the use of footnotes).  Nathaniel is a complex character, giving us easily as many reasons to dislike him as to sympathize with him.  He is no paragon of heroism or innocence.  The other and much more likable main character (or perhaps more accurately the true main character) is the demon Nathaniel summons and the trilogy's title character.  Unlike Nathaniel, whose section is told in 3rd person, Bartimaeus gets to tell his section of the  book himself, lending us a more intimate view and thus allowing us to empathize more directly with him.  Even better, his is a wry, cynical voice,  bitingly funny.  He also has the advantageof centuries of experience to call upon for more material with which to sharpen his wit.  His sections are simply a pleasure to read.  He too is more complex than is typical in these works.  For instance, a scene where he somewhat blithely is willing to kill three young teens with little remorse reminds us he is no tame funny pet for either Nathaniel or the reader.<BR>   While Nathaniel's main antagonist, an evil wizard whose plots really aren't that out of character for magicians in general it turns out, is perhaps one of the weaker characters--a bit bland in both villainy and dialogue, the various demon antagonists of Bartimaeus are all wonderful creations, especially his two long-running nemeses whom he comes across several times.<BR>  The structure moves back and forth skillfully between Bartimaeus's first person narration and the third-person description of what is happening with Nathaniel, pulling away from one to the other at just the right moments to create the greatest suspense.  It is all deftly handled with no confusion whatsoever.<BR>  The story itself is well-paced and complex enough to keep the reader guessing.  It ends independently but with enough loose ends to point to an obvious sequel, which I for one eagerly await.  Very highly recommended.

6305308659|4.0|Prior to his impressive work with 2003's Seabiscuit, writer Gary Ross (Big, Dave) made his directorial debut with this slyly comic gem of a movie.  Ross has described himself as a \\"fabulist,\\" telling his stories in big, bold colors-in Pleasantville's case, literally as well as figuratively.<br />Surrounded by doom-spouting teachers and the drone of American suburbia, ignored by their divorced parents, high school twins David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer Wagner (Reese Witherspoon) have developed very different strategies for coping with teenage alienation.  Shy, geeky David looses himself in the perfect world of a B&W 1950s sitcom called Pleasantville, while sexually precocious Jennifer pursues guys and popularity.  When their mother (Jane Kaczmarek) goes out of town, a fight between the siblings over possession of the television results in a broken remote control.  An unlikely good fairy arrives in the form of an elderly repair man (Don Knotts), who offers the twins a remote that will \\"put [them] right in the show.\\"  Much to their horror, the new toy does exactly that, and the siblings find themselves trapped in Pleasantville, in the identities of Bud and Mary Sue Parker, the children of doting parents George (William H. Macy) and Betty  Parker (Joan Allen).<br />Pleasantville both spoofs and pays homage to 1950s TV shows--a tough balancing act that Ross performs with uncommon skill.  Betty serves her family a gourmet breakfast; the firemen only rescue cats; the basketball players never miss the hoop; there are only two streets in town, no double beds, and no toilets.  The weather is always 72 degrees and sunny; people exclaim things like \\"gee whiz!\\"; everyone is attractive and good-natured; and of course, nobody has sex.<br />The twins react to their virtual imprisonment in predictable ways.  David uses his extensive knowledge of the series to negotiate its pre-fab world, secretly pleased to dwell in his fantasy refuge.  Jennifer is bored out of her mind, and against David's insistence that they not alter the show's continuity, she takes basketball captain Skip (Paul Walker) out for a wild night at Lover's Lane.  Suddenly a crimson rose is blooming in Pleasantville's B&W Eden.<br />As the town's teens discover the pleasures of sex, color begins to spring up everywhere--at first in little splashes, but then in great swaths.  With the show's carefully scripted existence thrown to the winds, the characters break out of their two-dimensional roles and develop real personalities, the profusions of color mirroring these transformations.  Even David, who initially fights the changes, begins to see their value: in this environment, he has opportunities for love, heroism, and leadership that he never had in his previous life.<br />Of course, some denizens of Pleasantville don't react well to this colorful metamorphosis.  Led by the town's mayor, Big Bob (the late J.T. Walsh), the remaining B&W characters fight to keep the status quo intact; things turn ugly when a group of young ruffians begin to bully and harass the \\"colored\\" folks.  Here, Ross takes an unfortunate stumble: after a night of riots, book burning, and physical assaults, Big Bob restores order simply by issuing a new Code of Conduct.  It's a jarring change; one senses Ross struggling between a lighter and a darker approach, settling awkwardly between the two.  He also doesn't know quite how to end the story; apart from a nice scene between David and his mother, the movie drifts to a vague close.  This may have been done intentionally; however, it robs the ending of real impact.<br />The use of color as a civil rights metaphor is clumsy at best.  For one thing, it's unnecessary: the emergence of color works beautifully as a metaphor for personal transformation, with the characters discovering untapped aspects of their personalities, be it through romance, art, intellect, or new emotional experiences.  The attempt at a Big Statement about racism saps the first, stronger metaphor of its impact, and given the movie's all-white cast, also smacks of hypocrisy.<br />Despite these problems, Pleasantvile has many strong points.  The script is deft and sharp, crackling with wit and funny one-liners.  Ross pays homage to the idealized world of the 1950s even as he lampoons that fantasy and exposes its dark underbelly.  The characters all grow in ways that make sense and feel organic.  The visuals are wonderful: the town looks appropriately two-dimensional and fake; the costumes are vintage 1950s; the humor-filled Randy Newman score is punctuated with classic tunes of the era; and the gradual transformation from B&W into color is visually stunning.<br />The cast is so excellent that in places it's easy to overlook the film's weaknesses.  Tobey Maguire, in his first leading role, carries the story from start to finish, easily holding his own against veteran actors twice his age.  Displaying the grace, understatement, and versatility that have become his trademarks, he handles the character's emotional gamut effortlessly.  It's a familiar role for him--the awkward boy who grows into a confident young adult--but the approach he brings is so fresh, natural, and appealing that it's easy to see why he excels playing this type of character.<br />Unfortunately, Witherspoon doesn't deserve any accolades.  She's far from terrible--she has a number of good scenes, and some of her expressions are hilarious--but mostly she just comes across as shrill and annoying.  Playing opposite Maguire is a two-edged sword.  On one hand, Maguire can make almost any co-star look good, and working with him probably spurred Witherspoon to try her best; on the other hand, spending so much time on-screen with him makes it too obvious that she's not in his league.<br />The rest of the cast is spot-on perfect.  Joan Allen is particularly good as a repressed housewife who blossoms into a passionate, emotionally expressive woman (her scene in the bathtub is an absolute classic).  Macy is similarly wonderful as a well-meaning guy completely befuddled by changes he can barely begin to process.  He has his best scene stomping around in the rain, repeating \\"where's my dinner?\\" as if he expects the meal to materialize out of the sidewalk.  In one of his final performances, Walsh is great as the town's benevolent-dictator mayor.  Rounding out the main cast is Jeff Daniels as Bill, owner of the town soda shop, who discovers the joys of love and art simultaneously; he plays off both Allen and Maguire beautifully.<br />The supporting players are also strong.  Knotts is perfectly cast as the TV repairman; Kaczmarek is very effective in her small role as a divorced suburban mom; Paul Walker shines as doofy heartthrob Skip; and Marley Shelton is warmly appealing as David's love interest, Margaret
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre when I was about 10 years old.  I loved it then and I love it even more now as a 30-something year old.  I think it was so much better than the one they made a few years ago. Carol Burnett is so funny as Ms. Hannigan.  I didn't get the humor as a child, which makes it even more enjoyable as an adult now. I would highly recommend it for families and for big kids like myself.
055357342X|5.0|Amazing. The epic continues and the stakes are raised even higher than they were in the second book. The death of a very integral character surprised me and many at the end of the first book and only continued in the second. Try not to fall in love with anyone too much because you'll never know who is offed next. With the third you can expect armies of the undead, messy and costly battles to all of the families, and dragons in full destructive mode. The intrigues take unexpected turns, even to skeptics who beleived they had it all figured out. My only worry is that the story gets somuch deeper that I don't know if Martin can reasonably pull it all together in just two more books. As a fan of the Wheel of Time I find it refreshing that Martin can convey as much of a richly detailed back story as well as an equal amount of back-stabbing without the need to stretch it out over ten billion volumes. READ THIS SERIES! I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!!
6302878527|5.0|Well first i should say that Two For the Road is practically my life and my partner's life story. However, four years before I was married I had first seen the film.....little was i to know.<br />Now thirty-three years later, more happily married than ever, I look at this film as a timeless, classic work that survives while so many others have failed.<br />The writing is superb in its wit and poignancy - a poignancy that was applicable then and is as pertinent now.<br />Lines like, Finny pointing to the obnoxious child, \\"Do you Still want a Child..\\" And Hepburn replies, \\"Yes! just not THAT child..\\" The statement speaks volumes for those deciding on children or not....it exemplfies how individual that decision is. <br />Finny is as funny as hell as a typical male and Hepburn is sweetness personified in her portrayal.  <br />They grow old together, in sickness and in health, good times and bad, joy and happiness and pain and sorrow. They live in a world of reality where life is a roller coaster and no one is perfect.  They make it through the times of deceipt and betrayal by knowing the greater part of their marriage is positive and rewarding.  <br />The film is brilliantly photographed, the score is uncomplicated and lovely. Sub plots like the erosion of the environment because of over-building and the superficial needs and crutches of the overly monied add to support the central them of compromises and misfortunes even in the best of worlds and relationships.<br />Rent it -- Oh and for god's sake will someone please get this on DVD -- and see a big dose of healthy truth wrapped in glorious scenery, incredible fashions and wonderful performances.<br />God i LOVE this movie.
B00001OH7J|4.0|Yeah, it's indeed an honor for me to become the first reviewer of this great album. Earlier, I had the Gallagher exposure in his former band Taste &amp; the Isle Of Wight video &amp; I started liking him when i saw the performance of Sinner Boy in that video. Photo-Finish, in a word, is a perfect blues-rock album one can expect from a genius gutarist like Gallagher.  Gallagher's vocals &amp; guitaring in this album are very attractive &amp; matured &amp; all tracks are full of catchy hooks. The album kicks off with Shin Kicker which is a bluesy rocker. There are various mood swings you can feel on this disc...sometimes loose, bluesy feel &amp; at other times uptempo adrenilizing rockers which make this album charming &amp; balanced as well. Tracks like Brute Force &amp; Ignorance, Cruise On Out, Mississippi Sheiks will give you an ample scope to explore the music in Rory Gallagher. But the most shining moment of the disc is Shadow Play, a powerful, uptempo rocker with great groove, tight rhythm, upper register singing &amp; killer hooks which will set your feet a-rolling. In fact, all tracks including the bonus ones are equally enjoyable. The production is slick, the music is catchy &amp; charming, so what are you waiting for? Just go &amp; grab it, fellas !!!
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is by far one of the best books that I have read in high school.  The meaning of the title, Pride and Prejudice, is present throughout the novel.  The main characters portray the meaning of the title.  It was a must that they, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, marry, but their pride and prejudice were keeping these two characters apart temporarily.  Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are so different,  yet so similar.  Pride is one of the main barriers that creates an obstacle to Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage.  Darcy's pride in his position in society keeps him from interacting with anyone outside his society, which includes Elizabeth.  Elizabeth's initial prejudice against Darcy is rooted in pride of her own judgment of people.   She was very proud in her ability to judge people by their  first impression.  But these characters were able to overcome their flaws and realize they were destined for each other.<BR> My favorite chapters are chapter 12 and 13 in volume II.  I like these chapters because this is where Darcy reveals the truth to Elizabeth and Elizabeth begins to analyze Darcy's actions.  Darcy explains the reasons why he prevented Bingley  from marrying Jane and the reason why Darcy and Wickham dislike each other.   Thereafter, Elizabeth realized the she judged Darcy completely wrong and that her vanity has been the cause of her prejudice.  This is the chapter where both Elizabeth and Darcy realize their faults and it is also the turning point in the novel.  <BR>   This novel would be appropriate for people 15 years and older. It does not have  a complex plot, and the reader is able to evaluate each character after carefully reviewing their role in Pride and Prejudice. <BR>    One literary device that I appreciated was the way Jane Austen revealed the personality of each character.  Jane Austen revealed the characters through letters, and revealing the character's effect on others.  I liked the way Jane Austen used indirect characterization, whichforced the reader to use his/her own judgment, thus putting clues together to figure out the personality of each character.<BR>   I enjoyed this novel and I recommend it to others.  Throughout this novel one is able to see the flaws of people regardless of social standings.  People from all social levels  are alike-they are all PROUD.  Therefore, one is able to conclude that human happiness is found by living a life in accordance with human dignity, which is a life in accordance with virtue.  Human dignity and virtues go hand in hand, happiness is found in human dignity which is found in virtue, and together anybody could over come it, like Darcy and Elizabeth did.
8590379817|5.0|The Lua programming Language has been around for a while but this book by Roberto Ierusalimschy will be a mark in its history. The book managed to surpass every expectation I had for it, and I was eager! From someone with no Lua knowledge to those with Lua klocs in their backs, this book will be a great companion in a nice to read trip down the Lua 5.0 lane.<br />The book begins with the basic Lua elements and structures and then advances through control structures, functions, iterators and coroutines. Iterators and coroutines are one of those language features that may confuse the first timers, but the author manages to show the concepts and inter relations between them in a way that clarified the issues even for a seasoned Lua programmer. Alas, make no mistake, the whole first part is totally worthwhile for non beginners.<br />The second part of the book shows one of Lua biggest assets: tables and metatables. I've seen people sneer at Lua at first glance and then convert themselves to Lua evangelists simply for the features of tables and metatables. The author does his magic and makes a whole set of apparently complex concepts flow by the reader as fluid and logical as they can be.<br />By the way, fluency is arguably one of the major benefits of this book. The reader is taken from substrate to substrate of the Lua way of life without even taking notice. Every end of chapter left me with the satisfaction of having been presented with one more facet of Lua and with the tranquility that everything was falling in place at the right timing.<br />After tables and metatables, the book presents the concepts of Packages and Object Orientation in Lua. If you had any doubt ever that Lua was able to sustain &quot;real&quot; Modular/OO programming, be prepared to replace your dogmas. The book not only clarifies how to do it in Lua but also shows how easy and clear the coding gets.<br />The author ends the second part of the book with a great chapter on Weak Tables. I have toadmit that I was somewhat refractory to Weak Tables before I read this book, but after this single chapter I was converted. May the name &quot;weak&quot; not influence your judgment on those Weak Tables. They are great, and the book showed more about them than I was expecting.<br />The third part of the book focuses on the standard libraries. Those would be the Table, String, I/O, Operating System and Debug libraries. Instead of repeating the contents of the Lua reference manual, the author manages to show lots of new information about the libraries by the use of examples and clear explanations. There are some points in Lua that can indeed be quite idiosyncratic at a glance, but this book is more than enough to clarify every one of them.<br />The fourth and last part of the book brings us the Lua C API. For the beginner Lua programmer this part will probably be skipped, but for the average programmer and most of all for the hardcore Lua explorer, this part will be pure delight. C programming is not for the faint of heart, but having a Lua interface for your C library is akin to the jackpot of embedded languages in my opinion.<br />This part of the book shows that the task of wrapping C code for Lua is not only feasible, but easily done once you grasp the fundamentals. Have one thing in mind, this was no small task for the author. Describing such an plethora of resources and how to use them in six chapters demands a clear yet straight to the point approach, and once again the book shines through.<br />Step by step the author shows how to deal with the Stack, to get arguments from and return values back to Lua, to handle tables (even those big ones), to call Lua functions from C code, to call C functions from Lua code, to handle strings, to handle state (using the registry, references and upvalues), and last but not least to use userdata types and metatables in C.<br />The last chapter of the book brings two examples of the use of the C API, one offers a directory iterator and the other a really nice example of binding an existent library (expat) for Lua use. Lots of my questions on the C API were dismissed with those two examples.<br />I should also reserve a praise for the book index. Not only I've found it complete but it is easy to understand some details of the Lua structure only by glancing at the index pages.<br />Conclusion<br />Being one of the first readers of this book was not only a great honor but also a great surprise. As a Lua old timer, I wasn't expecting to be presented to so many novelties, subtleties and jewels of programming in almost every chapter. Was I wrong...<br />If you have not seen Lua until now, this book is THE starting point.<br />If you are acquainted with other versions of Lua but have not studied version 5.0, this book is a great shortcut for your new endeavors.<br />Finally, if you think Lua is your native language and no book could teach you something worthwhile, think again. I was grateful I didn't skip not even one paragraph.<br />We've got the language. We've got the book. Let the revolution begin... :o)

B00005JMJ4|5.0|No.  I'm sorry, but no.  I am quite curious to know if any of the individuals below whose gripe is an inaccurate portrayal of Japan or the Japanese people have any firsthand experience with the place.  While I don't pretend to be an expert, I do have a fair amount of experience with Japan, and for me the movie was a wonderfully nostalgic trip back to a land I enjoyed living and working in.  Granted, my excursions to Tokyo were occasional at best, since I was employed in the countryside, but I spent enough weekends in the concrete jungle to see a lot of truth in \\"Lost in Translation.\\"  Is it a sea of neon and crowded sidewalks?  Oh, yes.  Are there innumerable little hole-in-the-wall bars and karaoke clubs, especially in Shibuya and Roppongi?  Oh, yes.  One tiny 2nd floor bar, Sugar High, was a favorite among my friends and I.  Is much of Japanese TV ridiculous and over the top?  Again, the answer is yes...and many of my Japanese co-workers and friends would agree.  And there are prostitutes and strange pornographic offerings as well as huge temples in the middle of a sprawling metropolis.  Essentially, everything in the movie rings true.  Is it missing the normalcy of Japanese life, an insightful look into the lives of any Japanese people?  Yes, but that isn't a problem.  After all, the 2 main characters here are foreigners who are merely there for a short while...not long enough to feel at home or truly get to know the place.  Therefore, the movie shouldn't attempt to make the viewer more savvy or in tune with the \\"true\\" Japan than Murray and Johansson...after all, if that were the case, it would be harder to relate to their bewilderment and confusion in a foreign land.  Similarly, Coppola wisely avoided subtitling the Japanese dialogue (a technique her father made good use of in \\"The Godfather,\\" albeit for a different purpose)...we shouldn't understand it (although I think it's perhaps funnier to one who does speak Japanese) since neither main character does.
B000089RVX|5.0|The trick with this album is- the more you listen to it, the more you like it. Amy's voice can you give you chills- it's the perfect accompaniment to the hard rock background. The lyrics, I feel, rely on love as major theme, but, unlike some love songs, these songs are far from sappy. The music goes from being loud to sometimes being quiet and somber- but the transition of one song to another is excellent throughout- the CD flows, making it all the easier to listen to. There is not a song that I don't like on this album, and that is a real treat to find. This CD is definitely ear candy.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is something everyone should have in their collection..Firefly is not just a tv series that was pulled from the airways WAAAY too soon, but it is also an experience! The best casting in a long time and a great script, plus lots of great special effects and some funny lines and quotes as well make this series a great addition to your home collection!<br />Definately should STILL be on tv!
B00005JM02|5.0|How is it possible that every movie Pixar makes manages to top the ones before it?  They just get better and better!<br />&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is one of the best movies to ever come out of animated cinema.  Everything about it fairy reeks of perfection.  From start to finish, this movie is brilliant.<br />For starters, the animation is top-notch, it is simply breathtaking.  Every detail, every little artistic touch is wonderful.  One of the most beautifully animated scences I have ever seen is the jellyfish scene.  Wow!  Talk about spectacular!  I wanted to get up and clap when that scene was over.<br />The voice actors were absolutely perfect, in particular Ellen Degeneres as Dory -- she cracked me up!  I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.  One of the funniest things I've ever seen is the whale scene (and for those of you who have seen this movie, you KNOW what I'm talking about!)  Dory completely stole the show.<br />The other, more minor supporting cast, were wonderful as well.  Bruce the Shark, and Crush the Sea Turtle were fabulous...the fish in the tank were great...even the gulls!  I will never be able to see a seagull again without thinking &quot;Mine!&quot;<br />The story was unique -- funny and touching and heartwarming all at the same time.  It kept you interested from the moment it started, and never stopped for a minute.  It was rounded out nicely, and fleshed out to perfection.  I laughed and I cried, and when a movie does that, I'm hooked.<br />As is typical for Pixar movies, it started out with a great little animated short.  I laughed so hard just in that few minutes!  These are fantasically brilliant animators, folks.  This short is called &quot;Knick Knack,&quot; and it's so funny!<br />The only thing that disappointed me at all was that there were NO outtakes.  That is something we've all come to expect from Pixar, and frankly, I was rather looking forward to some great Dory outtakes!  That would have been HILARIOUS!<br />But oh, well, the movie was worth it anyway, outtakes or not.<br />Bravo for Pixar! I can't wait to see the next one!
B00005JM20|3.0|Rowan Atkinson tries to start his own Hollywood franchise with this reasonably funny spoof of the Bond movies which coincidentally (methinks not) is written by Neil Purvis & Robert Wade who wrote the 007 movies THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH & DIE ANOTHER DAY (& who according to IMDB will write Bond 21- due for release 2005).<BR>The World appears to be geared towards imminent disaster. French businessman, billionaire, supervillain & megalomaniac Pascal Savage (the always excellent John Malkovich) has stolen the supposedly heavily guarded Royal Crown Jewels from under English's nose (its not said if these include Bonny Prince Charlie's earrings)& is now setting in action his master plan of turning England into the Worlds largest prison: straight after he manages to get himself crowned King!<BR>Assigned to save the free world from the clutches of this \\"jumped-up Frenchman\\" is British Intelligence Agent Johhny English (Rowan Atkinson). English has been selected not for his skill & ability, but because he & his partner Bough (Ben Miller) are all that remain after all the other agents are killed in a bomb blast. Thankfully his new partner is the smart & beautiful agent Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia-whose acting ability leaves much to be desired).<BR>Predictibly the film is littered with plenty of slapstick gags (& a couple of mild gross outs- this is a PG movie after all)which Atkinson fans & kids will love.<BR>The special highlight for me is the scene where English crashes a funeral & is saved from disaster by posing as an escaped mental patient! My only complaint is that Robbie Williams sings the title song ARRRGGGGHHH!! How people call him a \\"rock star\\" is appalling! (I'll stop my review here before I break into a 500 word anti-Robbie rant. After all it IS meant to be the season of Good Cheer). A good movie to plonk the kids in front of while you struggle with all the sticky tape & giftwrap.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is Disney in top form...which, unfortunately, you just don't see anymore.  This particular movie is the crown jewel in Disney's repertoire.  They should have done more movies like this one.<br />As was always the case, the music is beautiful, the story is sound, the writing is clever, and the animation is simply astounding.<br />This Platinum Edition features a new song that was not in the original theatrical release, a funny little number called &quot;Human Again.&quot;  I was fairy trepidatious going into this film, worrying that the added scene was going to kind of ruin it for me, but lo and behold, Disney pulled it off beautifully!  That is something I did not expect.  The transition was seamless, you would never have guessed, if you didn't already know, that this scene was not in the original.<br />And, for those who are total purists and don't care to see the added song, they also give you the option of watching the original without anything extra.<br />They ALSO put in an option to watch the &quot;Work-In-Progress&quot; -- which shows the movie in its entirety, moving back and forth from sketches to midway to finished product.  It's quite interesting to see the transitions!<br />And of course, on top of all that, they have the making-of, and the special documentay features, which are worth watching if you, like myself, are fascinated by the makings of movies of any kind.  I never cease to be amazed at how a traditional cartoon is put together, it's phenomenal!<br />All in all, this special DVD is well worth the money you pay for it!  Disney may be losing its image these days, but movies like this one will forever remain priceless.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|I think that this cd is great.  It has the same quality as the other two but is different in its own right.  I think the best thing about it is that it uses people from the movie instead of professional singers which makes it even better. WIth Viggo Mortensen and Billy Boyd included, it is a great piece of music.  I especially love Into the West by Annie Lennox.  It is such a touching song and a beautiful ending.  The added card is a great touch along with the translations for some of the songs.  It would be a great addition to any true LOFR fan.  A must buy.
B00006M183|5.0|As a longtime Pearl Jam fan, this album definately lives up to a fans expectations.  &quot;Save You&quot;, an upbeat song, fast paced song, has some memorable quotes in it, as does &quot;I am Mine&quot;.  Ed Vedder, always having been a political guy, puts his fealings in words in &quot;Bushleaguer&quot; and the album closes with &quot;All or None&quot; a soft melodic song about deciding what's next.  I definately recomend this CD to anyone with an interest in classic rock!!
B000002LLC|5.0|Madonna has all ways changed her look and her music and this album is no diffearnt I thought it <BR>would  be ok, but I did not think it would be the best.I think this cd is a most have for all Madonna fans. recommed songs would be &quot;He's a man&quot; ,&quot;<BR>&quot;Cry baby&quot;,More and Vouge&quot;

B00004SZWD|5.0|While I always enjoyed Stevie's music, I was merely a casual listener. I finally took the plunge and purchased this as my first Stevie Wonder album only a couple of years ago. I'm now a complete fan, building up his collection. This is a great album. I do believe the first disc is superior to the 2nd. But that's my only quibble - if you can even call it that. You can truly hear a man who simply loves music and continues to push his exploration and experimentation with/of it.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a chilingly realistic novel about a young boy, ender, who goes to fight an alien race called the buggers. His adventures bring him to asteroids, and space stations. Although the plot may seem somewwhat drab from this description, the best part is the writing style of Orson Scott Card. He explains anti-gravity orientation so well, it nearly makes you sick. The fight scenes are graphically depicted, and the ideas for war are increadable. At the end of the book, metaphors flood the text and review nearly the whole book. The ending keeps you wondering and the entire book stays with you for your entire life. If there was only one word I would use to describe this book, it would be &quot;perfect&quot;.
0385335482|5.0|Shopaholics - buy this book!  It is very fun and enjoyable to read...I even laughed out loud.  If you enjoyed Bridget Jones' Diary check this out, you will like it!
B00008BXJF|5.0|\\"The power to believe\\" is their \\"Red\\" album of 21-century.<BR>Lots of heavy distorted guitars,noisy and disonant melodies and experiments.underneath them hides the spirit of true art.just listen to paranoic \\"Happy with what you have...\\",\\"Eyes wide open\\" or any other track to ehar what i am telling about.<BR>i thought that King Crimson will not suprise us as much as before because most of the modern trails were discovered on their previous albums.i was so wrong - their brand new work can stand pround along with \\"Discipline\\" or \\"Lizard\\".<BR>Brilliant piece of music,not for the weak ears.you can find it difficult but it will grow on you!
B00005K9QP|5.0|I loved this album since I first heard it.  The guitar tone is amazing.  It screams but is soft at the same time.  This is Clapton working his magic.  I can't believe the remastered verson has Bernard Jenkins and Lonely Years, two of my favorite obscure Clapton cuts from that era.  Bernard Jenkins is a great tune to learn from.  Clapton is the undisputed master of the blues and he sits up there with SRV and Hendrix as the best blues guitarists ever.  <br />Every song is worth the price of admission.  If you learn these licks you will be on you're way to becoming an accomplished blues guitarist.  You have to learn somewhere, and might as well learn from the master.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Initially, I wasn't too impressed with this album when comparing it to her first one, however, I had to realize that they were two different sounds musically and really could not be compared.  The style of music that is used on the album is much different than the popular sound of today which can create some dislike for the album.  I must say that Miss Keys has matured lyrically and vocally and her maturation shows well through her music.  After listening to the album over and over again I realized that although the album was different, it was definitely one to add to the music collection.
B00000099Y|5.0|This CD changed my entire views on music as an art. There is so much substance to this album it's overwhelming.  On a instrumental level these guys surpass anything else that's out there.  With complex arrangements, intertwining melody and energy, and harddriven percussion TOOL pushes the envelope to deliver an unprecendented masterpiece. Definietly the best CD of the '90's.  Check it out, you won't be dissapointed.
B000099T2L|5.0|I bought this album wondering if it was going to be another pop, giddish album, similar to some of the albums recorded by Destiny's Child; boy was I wrong.  I am an R&amp;B fan right down to the heart of me and I truly loved this album.  Beyonce deals with mature situations on this album and returns to her roots with some of the older sounding songs such as &quot;Be With You&quot;.  My all time favorite song on this record is &quot;Me, Myself &amp; I&quot; because it relates so well to just about anyone's life.  It is truly a timeless song.  Overall, I would say get the album, but listen to it with an open-mind because if you are expecting to hear Destiny's Child shining through you won't, and that's not such a bad thing.
B00006J3WH|4.0|If you're a Buffy-fan, you know you want this. And it's very reasonably priced. So get it already. The complete lyrics are included; and they're helpful especially when two characters are singing different phrases simultaneously. The art is disappointing: that artist has a problem with eyes. The photos are good (though most are black &amp; white) There are four songs that I like to listen to every day (mp3 player). There are several mediocre songs and a couple that are severely, painfully bad (sorry Spike, I like you and all but that smell is coming from your corner). The last few tracks are eery instrumentals (from other episodes) that would probably turn me into an ax murderer if I heard them every day.<br />If Willow's your favorite, sorry but you won't hear too much from her. In fact, she has a funny line about that: &quot;filler&quot;. Tara has an amazing voice and she puts it to good use on the album's best-written song, &quot;Under Your Spell&quot;. Buffy ranges from adequate to pretty good, depending on the song. We already knew from some previous episodes that Giles has a good voice for soft rockers. I just wish they had been able to sneak in a bonus track of him singing &quot;Behind Blue Eyes.&quot;
B00005KHJM|5.0|Okay, so, I lied... It's sort of like Rosemary's Baby. Sort of. As much as I like Rosemary's Baby, I think The Wicker Man goes a step further... a mile long step further. It's difficult to review this movie without giving too much away... I mean it started out really, well, bland. (I mean I almost stopped watching, but I'm glad I didn't.) However, there comes a subtle turning point where the movie delicately draws you in to its madness...<br />I say this isn't you typical horror film because it doesn't really have any of the cliche elements that make a horror film. But don't let that fool you... This movie is so very disturbing.<br />Give it a chance! You won't regret it...<BR>(...or maybe you will, because it's just so damn creepy.)
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|but this one is nothing but a piece of crap.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I loved his first cd and think his second is absolutely great! Amazing and hard to believe his sound when you see his picture and that he is only 22 years old. I have only had this CD a short time, but play it over and over in my car. It has just the right amount of english and foreign songs. I was excited to learn that he co-wrote and wrote some of the songs. &quot;Remember when it rained&quot; is one that he wrote - awesome how you can just feel the emotions as he is singing it. His range and mature sounding voice awe, inspire, brighten my mood, and just makes you feel good. Heart-felt and pure, Josh sings with his heart and you can tell even if you can't understand what he is saying. &quot;You raise me up&quot; can be translated in so many ways but one thing is for sure - it raises you up, spirits and all. I love most the songs but my favorite are Mi Mancherai (I will miss you), Per Te (For You), and When you Say You Love Me. If you haven't bought his first album you need to get it as well. Once you get the album you will want to find the lyrics in english like I did! For the true romantic, it's definitely worth buying!!! It leaves you wanting more!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I have been a fan of Tolkien for many years, and have read and re-read the Hobbit, Fellowship,Two Towers, &amp; Return of the King many times over.  I've yet to tire of these wonderful books.<br />When I heard about the triology of L.O.R. books being put to film, I was excited, but skeptical that anyone could do justice to the books that I love so much....<br />I was wrong.  What Peter Jackson and crew have done with these films is astounding!  Not only because of the fact that the characters are living and breathing on screen, and the imagined sites of both paradise &amp; hell are made real, but most of all, because the bitter and sweet essences of good and evil are exquisitely portrayed by the fine cast, not to mention the heart-wrenchingly beautiful soundtracks by Howard Shore which stand on their own as very fine pieces of musical art.<br />You MUST see the extended versions of both Fellowship and Two Towers...there has not been a set of films like this in my lifetime, and I doubt there will be any to top them in the future....
0446310786|4.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is a novel based on the childhood of a young girl. Bob Ewell, Boo Radley, Tom Robinson and Scout were all main characters. Bob Ewell is a mean, racist man who accuses Tom of raping his daughter. Boo Radley is a retarded, crazy person, so the children fear him. Tom Robinson is a black man who is trying to survive in the town with racism problems. Scout is the young girl who tells the story of what happens in her town. Bob has problems with Tom, so he said that he saw Tom rape his daughter. Scout has problems with Boo because she wanted to be friends and he didn't. My favorite character is Scout, because she wanted to know who Boo Radley really is, and she was determined to find out.<BR>If I could relate to a character in the story, it would be Atticus. Atticus is a man who took up the challenge of a new type of legal case. He, a white man, is willing to defend a black man. Atticus took the challenge because if he doesn't than he couldn't hold up his head in town, and he couldn't hold his morals and principals. He felt that Tom Robinson was innocent, and he knew that Tom wasn't going to be found innocent by the people. I am also taking up a challenge to become a U.S. Marine. I want to challenge myself to this because it will be a good thing for me. I want to be able to learn leadership, self-reliance, new skills, honesty and loyalty.<BR>I like the book. My favorite part is when the Ewell kids sat on the black side of the court, because they wanted to hear the decision of the judge. They knew Tom was innocent. At that point the town was convinced that Tom Robinson was not guilty of the crime. My least favorite part is when Mr. Nathan Radley fills the tree hole with cement. He did it because he doesn't like little kids to be playing with his property. Jem and Scout were mad that he covered the hole because they left a chain, a knife and a watch there. Mr. Nathan Radley was just being mean person toward kids that get near his property. In this story, I would change the way Boo Radley is. He didn't deserve to be like this. He was a good boy but had problems with his head. He was lost in his own little world and his parents just made his life worst.<BR>I would recommend this book to others, because it's good for people to read. It's very interesting with lots of detail about life in the old South. People will re-think about life back in the day after they read this book. Everyone will like this book.

2070364232|5.0|There is no better way to improve your French than by reading this book (and the entire series).  Shortly after meeting my fiancee (a French speaker) I began learning French.  We would read this book together...it was a wonderful experience.  The story is hillarious and it is not too difficult (I read it without too much trouble after having lived in Geneva for about a month).  This series is written in every day language, so you will pick up lots of phrases that you wouldn't learn in a class or in an \\"adult\\" book.  If you like to laugh, I am sure you will love this book.
B000089QEN|5.0|I truly enjoyed watching all 5 hours of this BBC adaptation of Vanity Fair.  I found it as humorous as the original novel was intended to be.  While some parts of the story are necessarily left out of this miniseries, I couldn't really complain.  The casting was excellent and I found myself laughing out loud at times.  Although some have complained about the soundtrack, I found it only added to my enjoyment.   It was a great story, and a great film, and I highly recommend it to fans of this genre.
0156013983|5.0|This books is simply one of the most wonderful stories ever written.  On its face it may be a children's book, but there is a strong message for adults regarding what is important in life and keeping one's priorities straight.  In terms of writing quality, the French version is on a whole other level relative to the English version.  Even if you only speak a little French, being able to read this book is the perfect reason to learn more.  Je suis certain que vous aimerez ce livre.  Bonne chance.
0393317552|5.0|I really liked the way this book was set up. It was clearly structured and Diamond carefully addresses each of the questions that are brought up. <br />Diamond draws information several different fields of studies and inventively combines the information in order to address the issue of why some societies quickly developed 'civilization' while others developed more slowly or not at all. This book is easily accessible to people of all levels of education and the arguments Diamond makes seem very practical and down to earth. <br />I greatly enjoyed this book. It was entertaining and interesting, and I think it is a must read for anyone interested in the development of societies.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The music on this soundtrack is nothing short of amazing. Howard Shore once again takes us, the listener, on a journey to Middle-Earth with style and drama. This is a great soundtrack, intense and moving.<BR> Go get this soundtrack, as well as the other two soundtracks. This is a great set and gives lots of music to listen to.
B00000FC5H|5.0|So I'm you're average high school student who's in love with Earth, Wind and Fire [kudos to my parentals]. I just have to say that this is by far the best cd I have in my collection. It has the perfect mix of songs to dance to, sing to, get intimate to, and just to feel good to. Thank you Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.
B0000CAQ27|4.0|I think this album is better then the last one.  Pink is a great artist.  I just love her voice.  Pink has really grown from her first album and she has grown better.  I love everything about this new album.  Stay the same Pink.  You rock!
B000002UAU|2.0|&quot;Rolling Stone poll says #1 album of all time.&quot;  Who cares.  Rolling Stone isn't much of a definite authority on anything, and the fact that they rank so many Beatle albums in the top 10 shows their embedded British bias.<br />As for Pepper, it hasn't dated well except for its reputed impact on music, which wasn't as big as often supposed.  The future of music was already being defined by others, including Jimi Hendrix.<br />The title track is good, and so is A Day in the Life.  Each song gets one star.  That's it.
B00005BCOL|5.0|I love this movie I watch it often...about a tramp, Joan Crawford, who breaks up a marriage, Norma Shearer, in the high society group. Norma Shearer shows her grace and classic beauty in her performance in this movie.  I watched it a couple of times before realizing there is not one man in the whole picture...I recomend this movie to anyone who likes a real classic....
B000002UAO|2.0|Should be listed under &quot;Easy Listening&quot;.  Not for rock &amp; roll fans.
B00005JLYW|3.0|I thought I was watching an MTV video, cool music, great looking ladies, and a lot of unreal special effects!  I did however, enjoy watching it as a movie.  I never got bored, and I did get a few good laughs!  The colors were vibrant and the 5.1 is great!  I enjoy the series, and if the cast continues with sequels, I will probably continue to watch them.  Kick back and enjoy it with an open mind!
0440178002|5.0|This book is an absolutely absorbing, unbelievable adventure.  James Clavell brings the romantic world of historic Japan to life with his writing in a way that I've never encountered in any other author.  This book is by far my favorite to read, over and over again.
B00005JM0B|3.0|Pretty good special effects, loved Claire Danes, but it could have easily become a made-for-tv movie.  The dialogue is terrible, even though the plot got a little more interesting in the second half of the movie.  Arnold's one liners are about as impressive as his political speeches, and the car chases almost put me to sleep after a while.  However, I still will watch again, and as usual the extras are pretty interesting.
B00005JLD4|5.0|I could not agree less with the previous reviewer's opinion of this film...  Rabbit-Proof Fence is the certainly the best Australian film I have ever seen and one of the finest films yet from this young decade.  Why?  It's story is real, poignant, and thoroughly entertaining; I never once looked at the clock.  And its heart-tugging without being sappy or overly politically correct; like the Quebecois film &quot;Robe Noir&quot;, one sees that neither side is completely in the right (unless you think its OK to sleep in the dirt, eat lizards, and have no formal education).  The film is visually stunning with brilliant colors and superb wide screen cinematography.  And the acting, in my humble opinion, puts this film over the top.  Kenneth Brannaugh redeems his downwardly spiraling career with a performance that will some day be held up just underneath his Henry V as his most compelling role.  But even more importantly, Everlyn Sampi's quiet but powerful performance should someday be held up with Maria Falconetti's Jeanne d'Arc as one of the most memorable events in the history of film.  She was stunning.  David Gulpilil's role as the tracker was also great.  It gave that &quot;uuuuuuu&quot; scary feel that I remember from reading Mark Twain novels as a kid.  All of this makes for a great family-film introduction to serious topics.<br />I thought the DVD image and the &quot;making of&quot; extra documentary were thoroughly entertaining.  I was also fascinated with how beautiful all those young Aboriginal children were.  In all my life I have never scene an attractive Aboriginal person on TV or film, and here I see that there are bounds of them.  This film was largely ignored by the US market and awards, but that means little.  A look at the long list of best-picture winning Oscars shows a long line of mostly forgotten and unimportant films.  Time will tell if Rabbit-Proof Fence becomes a great classic, but my overwhelming inclination is that it will indeed.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|I loved the DVD so much that I had to buy the CD too.All songs are so close to the actual original recordings as far as the guitar riffs and arrangements. Kudos for the music arrangers for not interpreting the songs their way but keeping the songs the way George wanted us to hear them.The musicans are OUTSTANDING. It is obvious that Eric Clapton gets emotional while playing &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. My favorites are &quot;I Need You&quot; by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers&quot;, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; by Billy Preston, &quot;Honey Don't&quot; by Ringo, and Something has a most unusual twist by McCartney and Clapton. I agree with another reviewer that I could have done without McCartney's interruption of Joe Brown. Paul seems to be pompous now. Needs to get the stick out!
B00005JMFI|5.0|This was a great movie, and very funny. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|Definitely a beautiful score for a movie.  I thought that it was written by Hans Zimmer (as others have stated) until I watched the end titles on the movie.  However, Hans Zimmer produced it which could account for the presentation and similarities.  The dynamics of the music remind me of the soundtrack for Backdraft (written by Zimmer) which has similar crescendos and decrescendos. If you love soundtracks that are both lyrical and stirring then this is a good one for you.<br />I must agree with a previous reviewer about the titles not matching the music.  I would have preferred them to really look at the order the pieces are presented in the film and then match the titles to that order.  Also, they call a title &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot; which doesn't match the scene on the DVD with the same name (the scene where Elizabeth is &quot;introduced&quot; to the curse on the Black Pearl, i.e. the fact that in the moonlight the crew appears as skeletons).  Whoever decided on what to name the titles was not thinking or had never seen the final cut of the film.  They really need to name the titles according to the scene in which they appear.<br />Overall, definitely worth the purchase price.
B000002H70|5.0|Let me start by stating that I'm an avid obscure/old school hip-hop listener. I've studied more than my fair share of music theory and production over the years, and I consider myself pretty well educated in it. I have no idea why I chose to buy this album, it clashes with everything else in my collection, but I'm glad I did. I can honestly say that this album, as a whole, is one of the best I've ever heard... Trying to explain it wouldn't do it justice. If you are passionate about music, then you will love this album for it's imagery and composition... If you don't own this album, buy it. It's one of the best music purchases I've ever made.
B000059TEP|5.0|Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze are a couple madly in love with each other when Swayze is murdered - but just won't entirely go away. His ghost is hanging around, protecting Moore from some bad guys and trying to figure out a way to give someone the information needed to nail his killer. The movie veers between genres: horror, sci-fi, romance, mystery. And then, there's Whoopi Goldberg in another signature role (she won an Oscar for this one); she plays a medium who is shocked to find that she really IS gifted with second sight - and her confusion as she comes to grips with her newfound power is hilarious to watch as she works with Swayze to pass on the incriminating criminal information. <BR>It's a tear jerker, especially the scene in which ghost and Goldberg revisit Moore in a passionate, loving, romantic sayonara interlude set to the music of the Righteous brothers.<BR>Marvelous sentimental schmaltz that works perfectly in every way.
0385491026|3.0|I read Cat's Eye after several of my friends recommended it to me. The book centers around the peer pressure and mental bullying girls can encounter during childhood and adolescence with other girls that often goes overlooked in favor of the typical physical schoolyard bullying that boys endure and how these interfaces can still influence women's self-esteem into adulthood. I feel as though many women can probably relate to the situations faced by the main character, Elaine. Atwood is really brilliant here at weaving in the minute details of childhood that stick in one's memory: a harsh quip from a friend, the one object that you MUST have to fit in with your peers, etc. In that respect Cat's Eye is a masterpiece. Why, then, did I only give it three stars?<br />The book runs out of steam about 3/4 of the way through. I wanted to give up on it after the story shifted gears from Elaine's childhood to her adulthood. I found that I just didn't care about her trials as an adult. Her obsession with Cordelia when she was a child is understandable and empathetic, but her continuing obsession as an adult lacks substance and doesn't really have a point. Perhaps I just had a different experience with my own personal Cordelia than Atwood did.<br />If you're an Atwood fan, definitely pick up this book. Atwood writes so many concise words of wisdom in Cat's Eye that I regret not picking up a highlighter. If you're interested in reading a better story, however, I would recommend picking up A Handmaid's Tale instead.
6302581907|5.0|I didn't expect to like this movie when my husband brought it home one Friday night - but I was wrong, wrong, wrong. It's hilarious, uplifting, and entertainint.<BR>Goldberg plays a Reno casino singer who gets in trouble with the mob and hides out disguised as a nun in a teaching convent. Maggie Smith, every twitch and blink in place, plays the mother superior who must cope with Goldberg's high jinks as she energises the convent, its choir, its students, and her own life. And, omigod! The music! You'll want the soundtrack when you've finished watching the movie.<BR>A feel good movie to die for.
B00006DEFA|5.0|If any movie of the past 20 years deserved the &quot;Special Edition&quot; treatment on DVD, it was Amadeus. This lush, accesible &amp; very moving introduction to the music of Mozart could only be improved by the crispness of DVD &amp; improved sound of Dolby 5.1. But this set gets even better than just technical improvements; it answers many questions film buffs have asked over the years.<br />The 2nd disc includes a 20th Anniversary documentary on the making of Amadeus. This documentary gave a new dimension to the film, at least in my eyes. For instance, all of the opera sequences were filmed in an opera house that has been almost completely untouched by the past centuries; this opera house was where Don Giovanni actually premiered! The casting choices are explained (I had always wondered how Elizabeth Berridge got the role of Constanza), &amp; many technical aspects, such as Hulce's performances on piano are explained. I found this documentary fascinating!<br />The additional scenes added by Forman to make this a &quot;Director's Cut&quot; do not add to the movie, in my opinion. Amadeus was a perfect gem to start, &amp; the additional sequences slow things down. The only scene that adds dimension to the film is the one in which Constanza attempts to seduce Salieri. His rejection of her explains her later antipathy towards his presence in her apartment. Other than this scene, the others deal almost exclusively with Salieri's internal demons &amp; are adequately covered in the original cut. The oft repeated &quot;too many notes&quot; should have been kept in mind by Forman!<br />Please, do yourself a favor &amp; purchase Amadeus:Director's Cut. Even if you think you don't like classical music, you will find within yourself a new appreciation for the construction &amp; theory of music, &amp; way a composer's mind translates inspiration into beauty.
B00005JKN9|2.0|With this cast and under Scorsese's direction, this film could have been great.  It could have been a compelling period piece drawn on a sub-culture little known to Americans.  There could have been tremendous insight into the struggles of an environment that contributes to gang life with subtle parallels to contemporary culture.  <br />Instead this is a 3 hour rock video peppered with historical facts made questionable by the historical hyperbole.  The characters are flat and cartoon-like.  Daniel Day Lewis became so immersed in his character that he lost touch with reality.  DiCapprio's \\"on again, off again\\" Irish accent was laughable.  Who was that cat woman who cut off ears?  Give me a break!  Frankly I wanted them all to die within the first hour, but thank you for the gratuitous sex and orgy scenes.<br />For a movie that could have been so intelligent, it debased itself by appealing to the lowest common denominator.  I wonder if Scorsese has ever seen \\"Mean Streets\\" or \\"Taxi Driver\\".  He could have learned something from them.
B0000691U1|5.0|The reviewer above who doesn't understand how one can love this album AND admit that they are playing against, rather than with, each other, just doesn't get it. That's what grabs me in every minute of this recording- three brilliant minds, challenging each other to break out of the square box of jazz in all its forms. It's clear that each of these men is a composer in their own right, and the competition is thick. It's like watching a boxing match between the top heavyweights- every second is fascinating. I can feel Mingus struggling to impress the Duke, and sometimes getting grumpy when he can't keep up. Then he starts plucking aggressively, daring Ellington to break out. Roach, always the gentleman, dodges and sways with each punch the two dish out, like a cool referee. I love every minute of it.
B000002KDG|5.0|This is Young at his best - if you like Neil Young, you'll love this album.  'Nuff said.<br />A note about &quot;Powderfinger&quot; - The story of &quot;Powderfinger&quot; is set in modern times, and is about a family of cocaine (i.e., &quot;powder&quot;) smugglers who use a boat to bootleg their product into the country.  &quot;Red means run, son&quot; refers to the bold red stripe on the bow of any US Coast Guard ship.<br />I suppose &quot;Powderfinger&quot; is Neil Young's poignant way of portraying the futility of the War on Drugs, as well as just telling the story of a young drug runner who had no choice in the matter when he became involved in this &quot;war.&quot;
B0000AXE8I|4.0|On the Movie:<br />Ok, this movie made me hate Larry and Andy Wachowski the first time I saw it. But then I decided to swallow my disappointment and saw it again with hope of finding something, and I did.<br />I believe that this movie is a work of art with some very nasty flaws that spoilt it to me the first time, but after my second time I watched this movie I just forgot the flaws. It's like if you couldn't remain angry at a child for doing something dumb after a good smile.<br />The Plot doesn't have any holes as I first thought. In fact, the twist the story had with Neo's confrontation with the Architect was amazing. The Orwell inspired \\"1984\\" view of hope and rebellion being measures of control released by the system itself in order to keep a balance and ensure its survival kept me thinking.<br />The film is very philosophical, in fact it has very deep ideas like the nature of choice, causality and the behavior of men. The visual aspect was incredible with a dazzling use of special effects and the shots were simply breathtaking.<br />But now lets analyze the flaws. Zion was my worst problem with this film. Please!!! do not do that ever again. The rave was completely out of place and seemed as a desperate attempt to win viewers through a \\"Baywatch scene\\" after the heavy philosophy the studio may have feared people wouldn't stand without (I don't dare to name this atrocity with an adjective).<br />The people of Zion looked everything but men and women who had found the truth about reality and awakened from a lie. They were more like \\"wanna party and be sexy for real\\" rather than \\"I'm fighting not only for myself but for mankind's freedom\\" idealists and warriors. The only characters I found real there were a wise old man with a point but claming to have none, a worried man in angst for seeing his vision of defense crashed by an etheric believe he didn't understand, the crew members of the ships and controllers of Zion, a kid and a bunch of old people in the council (which are considerable), but not the thousands of mistakes raving with an army above them.<br />The other huge mistake I found was the \\"Kung-Fu plus 10 000\\". The first movie had an amazing mix of action (yes and Kung-Fu) with dialog, character development during the fights, philosophical revelations and more. Reloaded had some grate Kung-Fu too, but the scriptwriter forgot the mix, the interaction of characters and the narrative beauty leaving only the esthetic, letting the Kung-Fu be the star... (for that I can rent an ordinary PG-13 movie with Van Dame)<br />In the end the movie left a grate foundation for Revolutions, but again with a mistake... (never end a Film like TV!!!). The \\"to be concluded\\" after a flash shot of a man infected with virus Smith (grate performance by the way!!).<br />Oh, and another thing I just hated was the exaggerated use if CGI in the Neo - Smith fight. (It looked like Final Fantasy). There were other ways to that more realistic...<br />But in the end I had to swallow my hate to this mistakes and enjoy the pros of the movie. My conclusion is that there were errors in the script (in the way of deep narrative during the fights and using things without purpose)<br />If you cut some parts like the Zion rave, you can still understand the movie without any loss. If you reduce the Kung-Fu a little bit and add character development like in the first Matrix (1st is less expensive and 2nd makes a better movie). <br />The movie began incredibly boring, (just kung fu (without context), usless and ridiculous rave, kung fu (without context), kung fu (without context), and no development at all. But after the conversation with oracle, things began to improve, and by the time Neo was in the building I was hooked. The twists at the end were great and turned my imagination wild.<br />Dispite the flaws, I still love the good parts of the movie and think Revolutions makes amends. <br />On the DVD:<br />Great transfer (both audio and video). Great Information in the Special Features. But...<br />The extras had one flaw, a very plain audio track. They put one track and left it playing the whole documentary killing the rhythm. But the information is still very interesting.<br />Could have been better... but hey, nobody is perfect.<br />If you have doubts about this movie, watch Revolutions first and then think if you can forgive what you didn't like. In my case, I only had to watch Reloaded again...
B0000787FH|5.0|When \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" first hit the shelves, critics were falling over themselves with superlatives. Even Columbia's \\"Artist...Masterpiece?\\" ad campaign was begging the question. Was this the album that would crack the new wave stereotype that had been hung around Elvis Costello's neck since \\"My Aim Is True?\\"<br />The answer was yes...and no.<br />Granted, hiring Geoff Emerick to put his Beatle-esque touches made for a handsome, rich sound, more than any other album in EC's discography. The expansiveness paid off right from the album's opener, \\"Beyond Belief.\\" Toying with his own range and the overlapping vocal parts, Elvis' willingness to experiment rocked the foundations of all the early \\"punks\\" of the period. (Think of how closely Joe Jackson's \\"Night And Day\\" and The Police's \\"Synchronicity\\" followed.) The experiments were also inherent to the arrangements. The high pitched strings that slip out of the album's fade to \\"Town Cryer\\" were four cellos overdubbed to sound like an entire string section, as I recall.<br />Working from the pretext that they could experiment like the Beatles did, each song was tinkered and toyed with till (as you can hear in the comparisons to the bonus disc's demo versions)  they barely resembled their original ideas. It made the original album's side one a song suite of near \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" proportions, with the standout of \\"Man Out Of Time\\" marking the perfect bridge between the Elvis of old and the Elvis of new. His anguished howl that breaks the song open and then ushers it into the heartbreak of \\"Almost Blue\\" reset the boundaries of compositions in 1982.<br />Comparisons to Gershwin and Porter were also being tossed around when \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" first came out, one suspects they had more to do with overzealous critics trying to make associations with \\"serious music\\" than to the obvious merits of Elvis' songwriting prowess. The debt to Tin Pan Alley (\\"The Long Honeymoon\\") is truly there. But the lyrical jabs and jibes are still pure Costello, and a line like \\"In a private detective overcoat and dirty deadman's shoes\\" would be perfect for that kind of stage production cross. I'd be hard pressed to imagine Cole Porter working up the anger behind \\"Shabby Doll.\\"<br />In short, the dark and introspective \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" was a turning point for Elvis, final proof that he was at the crest of the still expanding wave of British writers that had begun emerging in the early 80's. It was likely the best album of 1982 as well.re Costello, and a line like \\"In a private detective overcoat and dirty deadman's shoes\\" would be perfect for that kind of stage production cross.

B0000DJZA5|4.0|Imagine for a moment tripping back to 1968/69.  The social  conciousness of the way we perceived events of the world was changing.  While not bombarded with information overload we had time to digest the rapidly changing social structures.  Imagine that after the Beatles &quot;White Album&quot;, this version of Let It Be came out.  The crisp sound.  The spartan musicianship.  The song line up.  No evidence on this disc of disharmony in the band.  People would have embraced this record.  It would not have been the swan song of the Beatles.  Abbey Road would have followed and the Beatles would have become legends today 35 years later.  Oh, wait a minute, they are legends.  Well guess what?  This IS the album that should have been.  Thanks Paul and Ringo (and George, belatedly) for finally setting the record (no pun intended) straight.  You should buy it and find out how good those four young men really were all over again!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|First of all, I am skeptical of the motives of the people who wrote some of the bad reviews for In the Zone. It sounds like most of them are jealous of Britney and have not even heard her album. That said In the Zone is a welcome departure from Britney's bubble gum pop days. The songs really expose Britney. The album is so honest (Touch of my hand, everytime--written for Justin Timberlake). The best songs are (I got that) Boom Boom, Showdown and Everytime. The worst (which are still great, just not as good as the others) are toxic and Me Against the Music (this song was rushed). The album has great beats and as with everything Britney, is incredibly addicting. Purchase your copy today, you will not be let down.

B0000C7GG2|4.0|With Absolution, Muse have topped my expectations and even have moments of sheer brilliance. Absolution is a rock record, first and foremost, but its one that can be quite deep in lyrics and arrangement one moment, and very stripped down the next. The same voice of Matt Bellamy is back, and in my opinion, has lost some of the Thom Yorke-ness for which it gets lambasted here in the US.    A good place to start on absolution is the once, for download single, Stockholm Syndrome. That song is really epic and is a good representation of the whole record and what I think the trio are trying to do with it. Stockholm Syndrome is loud and aggressive, but beautiful and even delicately arranged at the same time. It's this balance, this dynamic, that makes Absolution as a whole, work so well. Time Is Running Out is straight forward enough, but only on the first few listens. Like most of the tracks on Absolution, they get so much better on the third or fourth time round. The song Endlessly rocks a little less, but is still as powerful as anything else found on the record. My favorite track though is by far Hysteria. And no, it's not a Def Leppard cover. Hysteria combine's the frantic guitar work and air-guitar-worthy riffs of earlier Muse with the stadium rock of say a Queen or U2. Lofty comparisons I know, but hey these guys do aim rather high. The catch is, they hit the target more than they miss.    I ranked this very high on my best of the year list (please check out my listmania lists for more best of) and hopefully you'll hear why this might be one of the best albums of the year.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|I have to admit that I never watched this show when it was on Fox. The concept just seemed too hokey to me at the time. But a friend recently convinced me to watch a couple episodes from this DVD collection one evening. I went the next day and bought it for myself, I was so impressed.<br />Granted, like most shows, it takes a bit of time finding it's feet, but the actors are all extremely good, the visuals are of a quality rivalling those of Babylon 5, and the realization of a truely polyglot society (not unlike most frontier societies in American &amp; other histories) borders on genius.  Overall, the storys are good, with an interest quotient not seen in the Franchise that Shall Remain Nameless in far too long. If it had been given time, and not to put too fine a point on it, Firefly might well have been spoken of in the same breath as Babylon 5 &amp; the original (OK, I'll say it) Star Trek. As it is, Firefly stands as a prime example of the difference between entertainment &amp; marketing.<br />I hope most fervently that the movie version gets made, and has many, MANY sequels.

B0000DCGT0|4.0|Beautiful to both watch and listen to, as David McCullough lends his perfectly pitched voice to set the film's tone.  Jeff Bridges is wonderfully cast, excelling again as the larger-than-life character/battler.  He also makes a good president in my opinion.  <br />But I was left with a few questions at the end of this story...<br />What happened to the white horse Chris Cooper saved and lived with on the outskirts of a Mexican town?  Apart from this minor curiosity, Cooper nails yet another role.  <br />Why did Jeff Bridges and Elizabeth Banks, Mr. and Mrs. Howard spend so much time around horses and barns, what was the fascination?  It seems a bit unlikely that's all they did during the Depression, travel from NY to California by train and pursue a single, seemingly ridiculous long shot.  Convenient, but this plot line needed to be explored a bit more for my personal interest. <br />And lastly, and maybe more egregiously, Tobey Maguire plays a convincing down on his luck loser (though his best jockey of the day was less believable and a bit rushed) but why did the film end with his voice over?  Come to think of it what happened to David McCullough in the second half of the film?  His sign off would have left me far more satisfied.  <br />These little distractions only slightly handicapped a winning movie.  <br />md<BR>[...]
0060090383|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is a first person account of an Irish woman's realization that she is a drug addict. It starts in New York City, but she quickly overdoses and is whisked off by her maladjusted family to a treatment center in Ireland.<br />The book alternates between what is happening to her in the center and flashbacks to her life in New York. What I like best about this novel is the great job the writer does of showing how a person's self image is frequently not grounded in reality--especially in the case of an addict. The author also uses unique descriptors, similes, etc. It really adds to the entire book.<br />What I liked least about the book was the epilogue. I felt like the book had one tone and a good ending then someone said &quot;hey, we need a more romancy/happy ending.&quot; so this epilogue was tacked on. That is how it read. It just didn't fit. Also, I found this book shelved with romance novels. This is not a romance, so don't buy it expecting a romance plot. It is more chick lit. Give it a try.
B000003N7G|5.0|This was the first John Coltrane album I brought and I am just stunned at the Beauty and Power of Coltrane's music.  I cannot imagine a better album or a better musician.  After hearing this album I wanted to buy more of Coltrane's albums.  John Coltrane's music is a treasure.  This is the only album I have or know of that you can listen to repeatedly and love more each time.  If you don't have it, buy it now, go out and get it immediately!!!!  I have never ever been more pleased with a purchase in my life. This album is the epitome of High Art.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I watched the first episode of Firefly (The Train Job) last year, I was a bit turned off by the heavy &quot;Old West&quot; influences. I never watched the show again.<br />Recently, after reading an interview with producer Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) where he said he was as proud of Firefly as anything he has ever done, I felt compelled the buy the DVDs.<br />In a word... Wow!!! I was shocked at how incredible this show was. Great characters, great writing, a truly great show that was never truly given a fair chance by the Fox network. The original 2-hour pilot (Serenity) was actually the final episode to air. Fox forced Whedon to write a new pilot (The Train Job) because they wanted more action. This was a huge mistake. The Train Job is a good episode, but it wasn't nearly as good as Serenity. Because of this, the show was likely doomed from the beginning.<br />But I strongly urge everyone to give this show a chance. It is truly one of the great sci-fi shows out there, one of the few that found its footing right off the bat.<br />Firefly rules!!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw this when this aired on FOX back in 2002. For some reason FOX thought it was a good idea to air Episode 2 - &quot;The Train Job&quot; first, followed by pre-empting every other episode whenever the baseball playoffs felt like going into overtime, and then ending the season with Episode 1 - &quot;Serenity&quot; and then kicking it into the uprights for not doing well. Oh and they forgot to air 3 episodes somewhere along the way. I stuck with it throughout and managed to watch about 8 of the 13 episodes that are on this DVD without being too confused and I could still see that something great was being created. I was severely disappointed at the way this show was treated. I mean what the eff is FOX thinking? It's like Disney hiring Johnny Depp for &quot;Pirates Of The Caribbean&quot;, but telling Johnny to not be Johnny (that scenario ended up okay as we all know after Johnny told them he's doing it his way or he's out there, and they are raking in the cash because of him). Or Nickelodeon hiring Jhonen Vasquez to create a cartoon, which ended up being &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, and then canceling it (but for some reason Nick still airs in on their secondary channel while the merchandise flies off the shelves at Hot Topic, a DVD is in the works, folks!!). Why do these studios hire these people and then they don't support them? Why bother hiring them, if you are just going to try and turn them into something they are not? I digress. Anyway, in short, buy this DVD, watch every episode in their correct order, even the 3 missing episodes, and prepare to be a fan. If you like stuff like Star Trek (but with more of an edge), Cowboy Bebop (without the noir) or just sci-fi and westerns in general, you'll love Firefly. This DVD is a god send, it's liking watching the director's cut of the series, it's so damn good. Joss if you are reading this, keep the faith, my brother. I hope the film version works out not only for you, but for fans of your show like me who want to see more of the crew of the Serenity. As of this writing, Amazon has this sales ranked at #15 on their DVD chart. Shiny!ore of the crew of the Serenity. As of this writing, Amazon has this sales ranked at #15 on their DVD chart. Shiny!

B00005V3Z4|5.0|I am not joking.  This is not only one of the most interesting screenplays I've ever seen, it is one of the most impressive debuts since Orson Welles did Citizen Kane.  Written and Directed by Richard Kelly, it features an all- star cast including Jake Gyllenhaal (OCTOBER SKY, doing one of the greatest performances of a lead character since Malcom McDowell played Alexander DeLarge in Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE), and many others including Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell, and Katharine Ross.  Not only should you rent this movie immediately, but you should buy the DVD.  Not only is it extremely reasonably priced, but it has great features, like 2 insightful and funny commentaries, and deleted scenes, and more.  This movie is one of the greatest films of all time, and is worthy of so many viewings, that it never gets tiring.  EVER.  Its so much more than that &quot;psychological thriller&quot; that it is advertised as.  It is a plethora of origniality, bursting at the seams with wonderful directing, cinematography, music, and editing.  Ha.  I rather like the sound of that.  BOOM!
B000002NJS|5.0|Having grown up in the eighties, there has always been a certain amount of sentimentality that I associate with Madona, however &quot;Ray of Light&quot; made me a die-hard fan.  Watching Madona reinvent herself album after album, I believe &quot;Ray of Light&quot; brings us closest to Madona's true self.  The songs are an intimate look into her life, beliefs, and a reflection on her past.  I found it interesting how this CD also reflects, the modern society in India (interesting scale usage and a tinge of modern techno influence so popular in India today).  I have owned the CD for many years now and still find it extremely inspiring and uplifting.

He's surprised by the sand on Cape Cod and amazed by southern accents. I got a few laughs at the start of this book, but soon it turned nasty and cynical. Bryson wants to follow in the footsteps of Dave Barry, but Barry offers humor without the caustic bite I find in Bryson's writing.

B000000OMB|5.0|This is one of the finest debut cds ever released, right up there with the first cds from Boston &amp; Foreigner.  Not a bad song on this cd, and the group as hard as they tried could,never make another cd, quite this good, they would come close, but would be short of the mark.  ONLY TIME WILL TELL, has to be one the best keyboard intros, the first second it plays, you know the song.  HEAT OF THE MOMENT, has a well know guitar lick, that any kid then knew. Although Wetton,has never been a favorite singer of my, with Asia, he was just short of great.  All four members get a chance to shine in their own right.  Every song is a classic on this cd.  Even when it was released in the early 80's, it was called &quot;dinosaur rock&quot;, that maybe true, still today, but it beats alot of what has been released in years.  If you like good playing, and songs that make sense, this is the cd for you.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Picked up my copy from FYE in the local mall for a great price and I haven't seen a lower price since.<br /><br />First of all, yes, the packaging is a bit cumbersome, but big deal.<br /><br />Secondly, after seeing the extended work print of Alien 3, that film has become my favorite of the tetralogy.  Upon its initial theatrical release, I was highly disappointed (except for the music) but I am now convinced that David Fincher was way ahead of his time and we are all now just catching up.  For my money, the Alien 3 discs make the set.<br /><br />Thirdly, I'm still not all the way through this thing!  I've had it for a week and there's still a lot of content to look forward to.  Viewing this set has become something of a hobby.<br /><br />Finally, any person remotely interested in filmmaking must buy this set as it offers a very good look at the trials and tribulations a great many people endure before we as an audience buy our tickets.

B0000DD7NL|3.0|Okay... I know I've given 5 stars to albums that are far from deserving it, but one semester in a music school has done it.<br />I've always been able to see the good and bad about things, let me tell you the good about this CD: &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;- I'm 19 years old and haven't been exposed to many original oldies, but I can tell that the old-school vibe this song has, is intriguing to me. Honestly... OK, I had never taken voice lessons before [college], but again a semester has given me a much better idea. You see, if I would have heard this before my first semester in school I would've problably thought &quot;Wow! Such powerful vocals... nice 'ooh ooohh ooooh oooooh'&quot; but, no. Maybe this is the most Alicia has to offer but really, that raspiness kills it when she goes for the high notes... yeah, she's taken voice lessons, but why does her voice sound so strained? Perhaps it's her range. Oh, sorry, I was saying the good... anyways... that's about it, after &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot; you won't find that much... I like the song &quot;Diary&quot; but it's not because it's an amazing song [it's a good song], but because it's has some vocal goodies that I can appreciate.<br />You know judging is easy but making GOOD music isn't (at least not when you're TRYING to)... of course she's not much more talented than any of the TALENTED students going to a performing arts school, but mainstream doesn't know that... they only know about the things that are shoved in their faces... but come on, honestly Alicia isn't that bad compared to the rest [she's much better], plus I've seen her, she honestly seems like a super positive person and nice, and no I don't think you can fake that! (I know you can fake being nice, but not being positive.)<br />So look at both aspects, musically this is NOT a five, but in today's popular music world it is not a one either. Let's leave it at three... seems fair.

B00005JMFR|3.0|I am a very big Matrix fan.  I have been intrigued since the first movie, but the final movie was disappointing to me.  It was heavy on action, but had one main plot hole that I can't get out of my head.  I am not a fan of movies that insult my intelligence, and I thought the Matrix was going to be an exception.  The first movie did and the second kept me very interested.  Even the video game was fun to learn more about the Matrix.  The Animatrix was really nice with wonderful short stories, but Revolutions falls short.<br />The biggest plot hole I have with Revolutions is the lack of EMPs in and around Zion to protect it.  We are well aware of the EMPs being the \\"only real defense we have against the machines\\".  Then why do only the ships have them?  And if there is a special reason for the ships being the only carrying device for the EMPs, then why did they send ALL the ships in Reloaded (except the Neb, and the Logos and the Mjolnir) to attack the machines without leaving ships to defend their only city?  Have you known any strategic leader to throw all their eggs in one basket?  We learn even in chess to not leave the king unguarded.  But Commander Lock and the council agree to send all the ships and their only real defense against the machines to attack the squids, which fails leaving Zion with little defense.  I would think if the human race was going to be wiped out as you know it, you would be more intelligent with your defenses.<br />Oh well, I suppose you wouldn't have had such a grand Hollywood battle if they had Zion surrounded by EMPs.  Hence my disappointment in seeing the Matrix go Hollywood and insult my intelligence. There is still much to see in the way of cinematic eye candy, if you overlook parts of the plot.
0553213105|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is an illustrious and fascinating book to read because of its twisted plot that attracts readers.  What really made me crave the book was the love-hate relationship Elizabeth and Darcy maintained.  My favorite chapter of the book was chapter two in volume III where Austen gives an optimistic overview on Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship as well as Jane and Bingley.  She expresses Elizabeth's strong feelings towards Darcy and foreshadows a second proposal.<br />  I enjoyed reading the book because of the setting and the era in which it was written.  It's quite interesting to read their proper English and try to understand their rare humor.  I believe that the right type of age group would be senior students, around the age of seventeen to eighteen and above because of the mature language the author uses.  I strongly recommend this book especially to women who like &quot;fairy tale&quot; type of endings in a novel.<br />  The literary device that I appreciated was dramatic irony because I found it appealing to see how Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship was going to end up.  It was exhilarating to see that Darcy was going to propose to Elizabeth for the second time and she not know about it while she was thinking she had lost him forever.  That to me was good enough to want to read the book all over again.
B000099T2L|5.0|This CD is that deal. I absolutely love it. If you love R&amp;B and haven't listened to this album, you're missing out. Beyonce did a wonderful job on this album. I enjoyed every song. She is a very talented young lady and I look forward to buying her next album.
B0000DD7LC|1.0|I was so disappointed in this album. I fell in love with her first release but this was nothing like that one. The first one had so many songs that instantly stuck in your head, but nothing on this album really moved me. She didn't use her amazing voice to its full potential on this one either. Disappointing.
B00008RH1H|5.0|THIS JAPANESE VERSION OF MACBETH IS WEIRD AT TIMES, BUT IT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST INTERNATIONAL MOVIES OF ALL TIME. THIS MOVIE TELLS A WARRIOR'S RISE TO POWER AND HOW HE VIOLENTLY LOST IT. ONCE YOU START LOOKING AT THIS MOVIE, IT BECOMES ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP WATCHING. TOSHIRO MIFUNE PUTS ON A CLASSIC PERFORMANCE AS WASHIZU. THE FINALE IS VERY THRILLING. THIS IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN MUCH OF THE AMERICAN FILM VERSIONS OF ''MACBETH''. AN INTERESTING PLOT AND INTENSELY GOOD PERFORMANCES MAKE THIS A 5 STAR CLASSIC. FIND A COPY OF THIS MOVIE AND BUY IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN! IN JAPANESE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS MOVIE HAS AN ENGLISH DUBBED VERSION.
B00000293E|5.0|Ignore the &quot;official&quot; review and then find this album on VINYL.<br />I purchased this LP back in 1974 on vinyl and still listen to it every so often.  The sound quality on a good system is just superb.<br />That the official review complains about the sound quality simply tells me that the CD was poorly mastered which is such a shame because this album is a joy to listen to.<br />Go hunting online and find the vinyl version - it's well worth the hunt !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I hope that when my life is over and when I am lowered into the ground my loved ones can add to my coffin two and only two DVD sets. The trilogy of The Lord of the Rings, and this DVD set of Band of Brothers. I have now watched this set in its entirety eight times. Every single minute. I have watched the boys from Easy Company turn from being green recruits and volunteers to battle-weary true soldiers.<br /> I have marvelled at the perserverance of Dick Winters, and with his unflinching friendship with Capn. Nixon. I have watched in wonder at the grit of all of the guys; Guarnere and Lipton, Heffron and Liebgott, Bull and Moose, Webster, Martin - I have even marvelled at what the replacements went through - and all of the other Brothers. There are not enough remaining words to say how powerful this HBO series is, and how everyone out there needs to view this DVD set.<br />These men were part of this \\"forgotten generation,\\" but I can state with every fiber of my being that I will never, ever forget what easy Company did, and what the 101st did, and what the 506th PIR did, and what every soldier who served his country did to preserve the sanctity of America. Once you have viewed this series you will never be the same. And so, it is my choice for traveling to see my maker, and in some small way, my way of honoring these men who were so belatedly honored for their part in World War II. I hope everyone will have the chance to experience what I have experienced over and over again.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|You need this CD! Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are phenomenal as Elphaba (The Wicked Witch of the West) and Glinda respectivley.  The song &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; is worth the price of the CD alone.  This is the best show on Broadway and if you ever get the chance to go see it DO IT!  If Idina Menzel doesn't win the Tony I'm going to cry!
B00005NRO3|3.0|VERY SHORTLY AFTER ''STAB'', A MOVIE ABOUT THE KILLING SPREE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE FIRST MOVIE, IS RELEASED IN THEATERS, A COPYCAT KILLER CONTINUES THE RAMPAGE. BETTER THAN WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT OMAR EPPS AND JADA PINKETT SMITH COULD'VE USED A LOT MORE SCREEN TIME THAN WHAT THEY GOT. CAUSE UNFORTUNATELY, THEY WERE THE FIRST TWO PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED. THIS MOVIE BENEFITS FROM NEVE CAMPBELL, WHO RETURNS AS SIDNEY. IT'S AN OK SEQUEL. IT SHOULD PLEASE FANS OF THE ORIGINAL, ALTHOUGH IT RUNS OUT OF STEAM TOWARD THE END.
0385507755|5.0|absolute honesty is found in this book...a book that people should read to be able to get a feel for the raw side of life and the daily ramifications of it.<BR>I want to also mention Nightmares Echo and Running with Scissors. Each book has its own words of honesty and many life lessons learned. Though these books are not for the faint of heart it will teach you about life and what really goes on within a persons soul
B0000TB05A|5.0|This DVD is everything that the Boston video wasn't.  It's live, spontaneous and conveys what the Elevation shows were like.  Both videos were compiled from 2 seperate shows.  However, this one has lingering shots of the audience and the band, while Boston often felt like an MTV video.  For some shows that works.  For this tour it mostly didn't.<br />Then there's the sound.  The PCM track from Boston was fine, but the 5.1 track was nothing short of unlistenable.<br />Thankfully the clarity is roughly the same on all 3 tracks.  I personally find the vocals (center channel) a bit grating, but it either gets better as the show goes on, or I got used to it.<br />Either way, for 12 bucks this is a no brainer.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|After years of absence focusing on her personal life (new child and marriage) and some much needed rest after her last commercial album and concert tours like Lilith Fair, Sarah delights us with her latest offering. Afterglow somehow seems to radiate the depths of her maturity found from those experiences. I have always loved her poetic and cogitative lyrics in her previous albums and she had not disappointed in Afterglow. All the tracks display a freshness of artistry while maintaining the distinct Sarah McLachlan sound her fans have come to love throughout the years. A must addition to your music library.
6305903182|2.0|THIS SECOND SEQUEL DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO BE MADE. ON THE SET OF ''STAB 3'', YET ANOTHER COPYCAT KILLER EMERGES. THE ENTERTAINMENT JUST ISN'T THERE MOST OF THE TIME. THE ROMANTIC SUBPLOT BETWEEN DAVID ARQUETTE AND COURTENEY COX SEEMS TO BE GOING TO A VERY BIG LEVEL. IRONICALLY, DAVID ARQUETTE AND COURTENEY COX ARE ACTUALLY MARRIED IN REAL LIFE AS THIS WAS BEING TYPED. THIS SERIES WAS FUN AT FIRST, BUT NOW IT'S LOSING ITS EXCITEMENT. YOU MIGHT WANNA STICK WITH THE FIRST TWO MOVIES AND FORGET ABOUT THIS ONE. EVEN THOUGH NEVE CAMPBELL, DAVID ARQUETTE, AND COURTENEY COX HAVE ALL CAME BACK FOR THIS ONE, THEY CAN'T SAVE THISONE.
B00000JMOJ|5.0|This is one of my two favorite Schwarzengger films off all time.  The other is Total Recall.  The Running Man was originally written Richard Bachman(Stephen King).  The Running Man is a life or death game show where convicts can win pardons to achieve the freedom that they have been denied.  Stalkers are what convicts have to overcome to have the slightest chance of survival.  Media is controlling people's lives and the truth is unpopular in the year 2019.  Ben Richards is a pilot who refuses to fire upon a crowd of 1500 rioters and is detained because of his noble choice.  The rioters are fired upon anyway and the TV says that Richards killed the rioters without reason.  Well, Richards escapes from his captors (with Weiss and Laughlin's help)who used a device around his neck which detonates when a prisoner is in an activated perimeter.  Richards then goes to his brother's apartment where he finds Amber Mendez, a musician who recognizes Richards from the news.  He forces her against her will to accompany him to the airport so he can get out of the country.  Stupidly enough, she turns him in and that is when he is forced to become the next contestant on &quot;The Running Man&quot; because if he does not participate then his buddies will take his place.  He agrees and is sent to the Game-Zone, a place in disarray because of a earthquake that occurred in 1997.  Richards faces Sub-Zero, Buzzsaw, Dynamo, and then Fireball(in that exact order).  Richards and Mendez then find Mick(played by Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac)who is the leader of the organization trying to broadcast the truth to the people and overcome the corrupt media and more specifically Killian, the scumbag host of The Running Man.  Ben Richards is an Amazingly charismatic character who is suprisingly well played by Arnold.  Compared to his other violent action films, Arnold really slips into this juicy role rather well.  This was my favorite movie when I was a kid growing up.  It is up there with the best of Post-Apocalyptic 80's action films.  The music score by Harold Faltermeyer is AMAZINGLY CAPTIVATING.  SCHWARZENEGGER TURNS IN A GREAT PERFORMANCE AS AN INNOCENT MAN PUSHED TO THE EDGE WITH NOTHING TO LOSE AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN!  I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THIS FILM!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is my first Norah Jones album and it's fantastic.  It's the kind of album you can put on to clean the house; or to read too on a rainy day.  It's the kind of album that doesn't just have one good song on it; all the songs are great.  She has a lovely voice and seems very talented.
B00006WUWQ|4.0|I agree with most of the reviewers here. The movies are pretty good and pretty darn funny. But the boxed set is such a rip-off I can't believe my stupidity. I could have bought each movie for $8, but instead I bought all three for $50. I was thinking maybe there was a bonus disc, but no. It is all exactly the same.<BR> <BR>As far as the movies, I will give my short opinion. The first one is really good, and Elizabeth Hurley was great. I give it 4 stars. The second one is the best of the trilogy. I would give it 5 stars. Heather Graham I think is the best &quot;Powers girl&quot; of them all and Mini-Me is just too great. The third movie I would give 3.5 stars. It is very funny, but Beyonce ruined the whole thing for me. I just can't stand watching her, she is so awful. The music she sings is so dumb, her lines are so unoriginal, I could go on and on. Dr. Evil was hilarious, Michael Caine was great, Mini-me and Austin are always great. Even the younger version of Powers was great. Beyonce just ruined it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a fan of Star Trek (TNG, DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise) as well as Babylon 5, I was skeptical when I watched the first episode of Firefly.   After all, I thought I had pretty high standards.  How could this upstart space western compete with my other favorites?  When Firefly episode one had ended, my standards had been redefined.  <br />I had never seen the kind of high quality acting, writing, and production on display in the Firefly series.  Most science fiction series are, to be quite frank, kind of lame for the first season, since it takes a while for the cast and the writers to develop the characters, storylines, and relationships.  Firefly shatters that stereotype, and from the very first episode, the characters seem like they have been &quot;in their skins&quot; for their whole &quot;lives&quot;.  <br />Firefly's aura is dark and mysterious at times, which makes the Star Trek series seem almost boring, clean-cut, and unrealistic.  But Firefly also has a fun side that really comes through with a down-home western feeling.  The tension that exists between the supposed &quot;good guys&quot; adds a dimension to the stories that does not exist in most heroic science fiction, and the writers of the series successfully captured the stories of flawed heroes that really triumph over their own dark sides more than simply beating up the &quot;bad guys&quot;.<br />Like any science fiction series, Firefly requires the suspension of disbelief.  There are some flawed economic theories at work in the show's premise, and the laws of physics are ignored in space travel, just as they are in Star Trek.  But the quality of the acting, writing, and production makes Firefly a series worth watching.  Be careful; watching Firefly may ruin you for any other science fiction TV shows!<br />Disclosure:  As a side note, I found it unbelievable that an amazing show like Firefly was canceled after a partial season, especially since its viewership was very close in size to the viewership of Star Trek Enterprise (a much worse show).  I participated in the &quot;Save Firefly&quot; campaign, which failed to convince management to keep the show running.  Since I was such a fan, my review of this DVD should be viewed with my prejudices in mind!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has great talent and I'm glad she's famous. There are really few artists who have both the talent and the ability to get it out there, whereas many artists have the talent but haven't been able to present it in a way the masses can understand, or artists who are great at looking good, even sounding good, but don't have the soul and life under all those waves they make. When I first bought her CD, I was looking for something to fill my ears. I didn't enjoy it at first. I thought then, she has a great voice. But I was looking for something else, waves I guess, so I sold it. Well, I eventually came back because it was sort of calling back to me, and I knew my soul wanted to hear it again. And I'm glad I did. Listening to this record is like seeing how beautiful one can be while being alone.
B00006RAKP|4.0|ive been an elton john fan since i was 10 years old. hes done some really good music through the years and most of them are here on this cd. there are some that i feel should have made this cd, harmony, elderberry wine, love song,captain fantastic and the brown dirt cowboy,i feel like a bullet, pinball wizard just to name a few. overall this is a very good greatest hits collection and well worth the money
B00005JMTQ|4.0|This was a great movie. Stars of the movie was Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson. While the ending was a bit on the unrealistic side. I've enjoyed how they address the issues of aging,sexuality,divorce,starting over with a whole lot of humor. This gets my vote.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|One word... wow!  Thats the only thing that comes to mind when I hear this album.  I believe this to be the best heavy metal ever recorded.  It captures the brutality of just about any metal act out there, while blending in melodies that can float around one's head for days. The musicianship is awe inspiring to say the least, the guitar playing is right up there with old iron maiden and the drummer has to be the best since Dave Lambardo(Slayer anyone?).  Here's what really brings it all together, the vocalist can scream and growl like satan himself, switch it up with some misfits singalong whoahs, break into the chorus with a James Hetfield like heavy singing voice, then drive it home hitting the high notes like Bruce Dickinson.  This band combines the utmost heaviness of early metallica, the melodic sensibilty of iron maiden, and the high energy style of the misfits or say afi. To make a long story short, do yourself a favor and buy this album.
B00004Z459|1.0|Linkin Park were really big when I was a teenager. of-course, I had their album (Hybrid Theory). I have just given it another spin after all these years. It's clear that the main problem with their music is that it is formulaic and very repetitive. But their weakest point is their persona. They do enough whining, whingeing and complaining that you may have thought they were homeless war veterans who had all the family murdered and had lost their body parts in the fighting. But that is not the case; this angst feels fake and put-on, probably because that was the fashion at the time, perhaps because of the success Kurt Cobain had with making a career out of his torrid childhood.     Here is a song-by-song run down after listening to this after ten years    1. Papercuts   2/10    - bad  2. One step closer 1/10 - awful, such over-the-top angst  3. With you 6/10 - actually, not bad  4. Points of authority 3/10 - not so bad, like the r'n'b sounds, but mostly it's poor quality music  5.Crawling 3/10 - tonnes of fake angst, might be good otherwise, the keyboards are nice  6. Runaway 3/10 - the lyrics aren't so bad, but sounds like a reworking of the previous songs. What? Ripping themselves off after only a few songs? And the screamed bridge is really bad.  7.By myself 2/10 - Gor-bij. What supid lyrics.   8. In the end  2.5/10  - not so much a bad song as sounding so much like the previous songs it raises no interest.   9. A place for my head 3/10 - The opening riff is really good, the chorus is not bad, but the 'you try to take the best of me go away!!!!!!' bit really grates  10. Forgotten 7.5/10 - A wondrous melody and innovative lyrics (really! \\"A little piece of paper with a picture drawn Floats on down the street till the wind is gone The memory now is like the picture was then When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again\\" come on, that's beautiful!) If it weren't for the over-the-top bridge I'd give it ten.   11. A cure for the itch 6.5/10 - filler, but not bad  12. Pushing me away 3/10  - the intro is good, but once you get to the chorus...     There you go, worth picking up for 'With You', 'Forgotten' and 'A cure for the itch'. This album is worth about 3/10, not THAT bad but it's bad... Rating * 1/2
1563894696|3.0|Murder mysteries and mafia dramas; there's a million of 'em. What separates the wheat from the chaff are 3 things: originality, characterisation and resolution. So how does this tale measure up?<br />Originality - Well, as this is a conscious homage to Frank Miller's Batman Noir, it's more a comforting return to established territory than anything new.<br />Characterisation - Yikes. Hardly any! There are 2 crime familes who are quite impossible to tell apart, and no insights into either Batman or any of the Arkham Asylum Barmy Army. (Jeez that place is leakier than a sieve.) Apart from the standard soul-searching about \\"the death of my parents\\", Batman doesn't use his grey matter either to look at himself or solve clues.<br />Resolution - See \\"characterisation\\". Without any credible motivation among the participants, the final revelation of the killer's identity is empty. In fact, it's right out of Sccoby Doo.It doesn't even make logical sense - but I can't tell you why without spoiling the plot, which is always unfair in a review.<br />So there you are. Only average I'm afraid, but I'll give it 3 stars instead of 2 for the beautiful art
B00005JM0B|3.0|Disappointing movie..., there is no real story to tell, the whole movie has no style, only action scene after action scene, with no character developement. The most disappointing is the music, where is the frightening sounds of the Terminator heart-beat from the T1 and T2 ??? Where is the Terminator theme ??? This is the kind of sequel that is made only for money. Fun, entertaining, action packed, but that is all one can say about this sequel..., it has no real connection with the Terminator line. It's just a faint copy of the Terminator 2: Judgement Day, with the story and music/sounds extracted... I only hope that James Cameron and Brad Fiedel will wake up us from this nightmare and they do &quot;Terminator 4:War Of The Machines&quot; or whatever, closing forever this great (except for T3) SCI-FI tech-noir saga.<BR>The movie DVD picture and sound is great, but the second disc is very dull, full of comercial crap. Pity...
B0000AUHPK|5.0|This version far surpasses the 1939 version.  The haunting spell that Bronte intended is found here.  Ralph Fiennes is near perfect.  Juliette Binoche is good too.  Together they impel the same emotions that the book does.  The 1939 version made me yawn.  This version made me cry.
B00000GAIW|5.0|I have been listening to this album for 2 years, and yet i have not found anything wrong with it at all. There is a perfect construction of acoustic and electric parts of this album. Aqualung is truly the best album Jethro Tull has ever created.
0385504209|1.0|The worst part is: some editor actually thought this guy could write. I stopped on page 50 after 50 pages of annoying writing. I gave the guy the benefit of the doubt, but he just can't write. If you like pulp fiction and are not annoyed by bad writing, you may enjoy this for the plot. I still like the plot and wish someone with talent had written the story. ew. ew. ew! This book reads like a freshman writing workshop project gone bad (and there's no such thing as a freshman writing workshop).
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Don't ever miss Showdown, toxic, Outrageous, Brave new girl, Shadow and Everytime. There's something for everyone (except rock so stop suggesting people to buy evanascence instead)<BR>One-star reviewers have not listened to it and they're the ones missing out on the good stuff anyway. I love almost everysong and don't judge the album by that crappy first single (me against the music).<BR>Recommended for britney and nonbritney fans. And for whoever said that this album was a flop, this album is the strongest female release of this year (after alicia keys). It's less compared to her previous massive hits but in today's music world no artist can sell more than what In the Zone just sold.<BR>Buy it!! Worth it!!
B00003CWRX|4.0|Michael Mann's The Insider is one of those films that makes you think then it makes you angry. In its most simple form the movie tells the story of corporate whistle blower Jeffrey Wigand and his battle with Brown and Williamson Tobacco. This story is only the beginning however. The film in its second half explores media ethics like no recent film that I've seen<br />Russell Crowe plays Jeffrey Wigand who has been fired from his corporate job at Brown and Williamson. Hired as a consultant by 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) to consult on another cigarette issue he gradually begins to open up about huge health concerns within the industry in violation of confidentiality agreements.<br />The film charts CBS News darkest hour. When it made the choice to pull the plug on Wigand's interview to avoid the risk of a lawsuit which could have cost the Network massive amounts of cash in a corporate buyout.<br />There are outstanding performances throughout the film. Among the standouts are Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace. <br />Even though the film is somewhat long it maintains interest throughout and remains as one of the greatest journalism films of the last decade or so.
B0000C6E4D|1.0|what is this. is she serious. i couldn't believe she actually released this as a cd. it sounds more like seconds they scraped up together off the editting room floor. <BR>this is embarrassing.
0156027321|5.0|For what it's worth, I've studied literature and have a degree in creative writing; this is the kind of stuff you should read and study! Martel's simplistic prose paints just enough of the picture to keep you engaged. And the plot/theme is well-crafted and just brilliant (IMHO). Martel takes a lofty topic and recasts it in a mold of his own.<BR><BR>I won't go into the plot because I'm sure other reviewers have done that. I will tell you that the story is essentially a study of creationism vs. evolution. Which story is easier to believe: That some supernatural force created everything like some crazy fairy tale or that the natural world just happened out of blank space? Which story is easier to believe: That a boy was stranded on a boat with a tiger that he managed to tame and found a living, floating and carnivorous island or that his experience actually involved humans acting naturally in the natural world?<BR><BR> My favorite fictional work of 2003!!
B000002BQK|4.0|When I first purchased &quot;Butterfly&quot;, I was not disappointed, and I assure you wont be either. I have 11 out of her 13 albums, and Butterfly is definetly one of my favorites. Most of the songs on this album are mellow and mid-tempo. This is Mariah's favorite album to date, and I can see why. Best songs: The Roof, Breakdown, Babydoll, Close My Eyes, and Whenever You Call. Expect strong, moving lyrics and catchy beats, that will have you hooked in no time. Be for-warned: In my opinion, if you dont like slow ballads, this is not the album for you. Like I said before, the album is mostly filled with mid-tempo songs, and the only up-tempo songs are Honey and Fly Away. The song that will make you say &quot;Wow&quot;: Breakdown. On this song she collaborates with Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone from Bone-Thugz and Harmony. The lyrics are outstanding, and its one of those songs that just about everyone can relate to.  Purchase Butterfly...You'll like it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Have you ever sat down to watch a movie expecting to be entertained, and instead found yourself deeply moved, even addicted?  This is it.  Firefly is a story about integrity, loyalty, and meaning in a harsh and meaningless universe. But it's also about laughter and love. Great stuff.  The best.
0345440900|2.0|I read this book when I was pregnant, before I had my first child.  Before I knew better, the advice seemed very logical and I was committed to following the advice.  However, once my baby was here, I found it to be unrealistic and did not fit my baby's needs.  It's not a bad book to read just to get ideas.  I read many baby books and took them all in in order to make my own decisions on what to do with the new baby.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|This album is without doubt my favorite for the year. It's also the first Muse album I have purchased, and did so after knowing very little about the band or album (other than some glowing reviews from street press and friends), and after only hearing the first single \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\".<br />This album has an immense feel about it, one of a glossy, highly polished product thick with instrumentation and body, but thankfully it doesn't suffer too much from it as it still retains the down to earth basics that is needed (much like the brilliant \\"Source Tags and Codes\\" by \\"...Trail of Dead\\" - in fact, if you like that album, don't bother reading the rest of this, just go and buy it). <br />Straight away you get an engulfing feeling from the marching intro and pulsating first song \\"Apocalypse Please\\" and its \\"this is the end of the world\\" lyrics, before running into the seemingly simple piano intro of track 3 \\"Time is Running Out\\". This song then explodes and once again spells doom as the \\"our time is running out\\" lyric spews forth from the thumping chorus.<br />\\"Sing for Absolution\\" slows down the album with a simple repetitive piano line that haunts the song and carries on the destructive doom undertones that are a common theme for the first half of the album. A stark contrast to this beautiful song is the full frontal assault of the rocking \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" which has an energetic beat and a vague resemblance to the music from an 80's computer game. <br />The next track \\"Falling Away with You\\" has a slightly easier feel, mainly in the sense that it is not quite as intense as some previous songs, whilst the lyrics are perhaps the most depressive:<br /> \\"Promise to hold you close and pray<BR> Watching the fantasies decay<BR> Nothing will ever stay the same<br />All of the love we threw away<BR>All of the hope we cherished fade<BR>Making the same mistakes again<br />I can feel my world crumbling <BR>I can feel my life crumbling<BR>I can feel my soul crumbling....down\\"<br />Thankfully we receive some respite in the short \\"interlude\\" but are thrust almost instantly back into the mirth, although this time around there seems to be a glimmer of hope on the horizon. \\"Hysteria\\" would be the highlight of the album, with a guitar riff that RATM would be proud of and a thumping beat to keep you tapping that head all the way through. Track 9 \\"Blackout\\" comes down from this high to a very slow string laden beginning in which you seem to be gently floating down a peaceful river, with almost a crooning to accompany you. The track slowly begins to build but never peaks and has a \\"sure your gonna die but maybe it ain't that bad\\" feel rather than a \\"your gonna die\\" feel as the first half of the album does.<br />Track 10 \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" is another brilliant work of art. This is one song that truly evolves and erupts before a quiet piano and string \\"intermission\\" arrives just before the song comes to a thumping end. It is also hear that the hope that has been under the surface of the last few songs finally comes soaring out as Muse sing \\"you've got to be the best, you've got to change the world, your time is now\\". Another song that is a highlight in an album full of them.<br />\\"The Small Print\\" is a pure punk rocker that would have even the heaviest thumping their head. This leads into \\"Endlessly\\" which is a smooth rolling song that is slightly quirky and has a very Radiohead (sorry but its there) feel. Once again it also picks you up with some positive lyrics.<br />Taking out the award for the best ever song title is track 13 \\"Thoughts of a Dying Atheist\\", which thankfully is a damn fine song and one that once again brings out a very punk prog style. The closer \\"Ruled by Secrecy\\" is a slow starting song that doesn't realer kick off until about the 3 minute mark where you feel the final piano notes building to epic proportions before lowering and getting more and more urgent before slowing down and fading out. Wow......now we can start breathing again. <br />Muse truly do obliterate, demolish, wipe out, devastate, annihilate, tear down and destroy everything before slowly piecing it back together, and all the pieces that make up Absolution result in one brilliant cd, without a shadow of a doubt, album of the year for 2003.<br />5 stars
0446530891|4.0|This is the first suspense/mystery novel I have read from Baldacci and I have to say that I was pretty impressed all in all.  Baldacci's ability to develop the characters of Sean King, Michelle Maxwell and flirtatious Joan sets up a suspenseul ride that I actually found myself caring about.<br />Split Second is a quick read that I found myself instantly drawn to from the beginning.  I do agree that 2/3 through the book the mass introduction of characters, suspects, and theories made connecting the dots a bit confusing.  I found myself having to pause and try to put all of the relationships together more than once.<br />I recommend this book as an exciting, pulse pounding read and hope that the door Baldacci left open for a series to follow comes to fruition.
B0000DBJDM|2.0|Firstly, given the scope and breadth of the Floyd's highly touted aural experience, why even bother to rerelease this without doing in 5.1. It's the industry standard, particularly among the classic-rock behemoth bands that are still actively making tons of money. Take the time and care and get it done. There's only one audio option and it sounds flat and bassy..The director's interview only scratches the surface of the process of filmmaking and how this shoot came to be. A commentary track would have been nice. And the subtitles only cover the interview banter and not the song lyrics, And I wasn't blown away by Maben's added footage. They are visually inconsistent, out of context and wholly detractory from the original atmosphere set by the original version.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Like any other fan, I was really looking forward to the release of this little compilation of B-sides and rarities by my favorite band. When I finally got the album I was delighted to see that all the hard to get hold of gems like &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;, &quot;Wash&quot; and &quot;Bee Girl&quot; were all present.  <br />Some of these &quot;dicarded&quot; tracks such as &quot;Footsteps&quot; and &quot;Sad&quot; would have easily been able to hold their own on any of PJ's previous albums. There are some songs on the album that wouldn't really impress a non-fan who bought it speculatively, but that would any longtime PJ fan quiver with delight.  The mood of the album is constantly changing from deep and sometimes dark on tracks like &quot;Alone&quot; to a more free spirited vibe with songs like &quot;Don't Gimme No Lip&quot; (With Vocals By Stone).  <br />All in all this is any Pearl Jam fans' fantasy.  If you are a real fan of the band, Lost Dogs is an absolute must-have and with two discs worth of music, it's not a bad buy for anyone else either.  I'll tell you this though: If you're not into Pearl Jam, but want to get into them, I'd suggest that you rather get some of their older recordings like &quot;Ten&quot; or &quot;Yield&quot; instead, because this album might be a little hard to digest if you're not fimiliar with the band.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather trilogy, I supposed that if you were to buy the Godfather you might as well buy the whole trilogy. I thought that the sequels were not necessary. The first one was incredible, a great plot, great actors, great decade to make it in. The second movie was great also, it had somethings that made it memorable, quotes, the plot was still the same which made pretty good. The third one had to come, only because it would've been really [incomplete]... without the third one. It was a wise move.<br />The first godfather was mostly about the leader of a mafia, and he was passing it down to his son. His son on the other hand was trying to keep out of the family business so that he could start a new life. But after the father dies the son has no choice but to assume the role as the Godfather. Al Pacino kicks ass!<br />The second godfather was about how Michael keeps the family striving, it also shows a little bit about his father, played by Robert DeNiro. The legendary brother kiss is the only reason this movie made anything. Its what put it on the map.<br />I dont know much about the third one, I have seen bits and pieces but it looks pretty stupid. I guess if your a godfather fan it would be useful to watch it.<br />Well thats pretty much it... Have fun!
6302794331|5.0|This is a great film.  If you have a heart you will love this.  Michael Caine gives an amazing true to life performance here.  Somehow tapping into the very depth of the character and you can't help but feel that he's somehow living out his own personal demons from his own life.  Who would ever believe that someone could give such a performance for a silly muppet movie?  Yet Michael Caine somehow takes hold of this role and makes it his own and turns this into a wonderful film of incredible human depth and meaning.  And more interesting is the fact that he plays the role of a Scrooge who is less of an evil man and more of a blind heartless man.  Thats really how Dickens wrote it.  In that regard everyone can see himself as a potential Scrooge and can identify with the things they've done in life which have been Scrooge-like.  I've seen grown men sob and have to leave the room after watching the scene in which Scoorge see's himself as a young man foolishly losing the only woman that ever loved him.  It's a moment in which love dies in his life and he doesn't even know it.  As a young man, he simply walks away - he feels nothing.  But now an old man many years later, he's a broken soul and all he can do is stand behind this lost love, who is now only a shadow of the past and sob in terrible sorrow.  He asks the ghost of christmas past, &quot;how can you take delight in showing me this?&quot;  With that moment, the truth of life is made reality and he understands the past can never be undone or changed.  There is something very beautiful and great about this film and no matter what religion or belief you have, the message is universal.  You can easly identity with the most important message.  Don't waist your life in fear and pride and ignorance.  Open your heart and stop yourself in your tracks.  The future.. your future, is unwritten.  It's wide open before you.  Make good decisions.  Follow your heart.  Believe in your heart again. It does matter! This great message is mixed well with the muppet characters that you remember and love from the 70's and also really great songs that are just dazzling, &quot;where-ever you find love, it feels like christmas.&quot;is mixed well with the muppet characters that you remember and love from the 70's and also really great songs that are just dazzling, &quot;where-ever you find love, it feels like christmas.&quot;
B0000E2FLC|4.0|As the website was having problems allowing me to enter a VHS review, I'll address things here.  I have the VHS edition.  A reviewer complained the DVD has VHS quality at best.  While I don't have the DVD, that doesn't make sense since the concernt was filmed on 35mm film - just like a normal movie.  As a result, any dvd mastering should come from the original film and look much BETTER than the VHS.  Now if the dvd was mastered from a VHS master... that would be a problem.    I have the DVD of the Muenchen concert from Stiff Upper Lip and can concur with the reviewer who complained bout the quick and frequent cuts and zooms that detract from the experience by never letting you focus on any event long enough to enjoy it.  If the person who did the edit directon on the 'Stiff Upper Lip' DVD is the same fellow that did this and they are not the one who did the VHS, then ther is clearly a problem as they must have changed things drastically over the VHS.  The VHS is FANTASTIC - and I can only highly recommend it.  For the DVD - maybe rent it first.
B00005QCVY|5.0|I just finished watching this movie for about the 25th time and remarkably, this movie still holds up.  James Stewart gives one of my favorite performances in his long and illustrious career.  Probably \\"Mr. Smith goes to Washington\\" would be better.  For some reason, this movie reminds me of a 2 hour \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode.  The plot is something Rod Serling would develop.  But Frank Capra brings it all together with charm and wit.  It's simple message is very much needed today, \\"No man is alone if he has friends\\".  A all-American classic!!
B00006BTCA|4.0|...these guys rock. Having seen their blinding set at Leeds festival I can safely say that Interpol's intensity and skill marks them out as the post-punk nostalgia band for the noughties. I love every track on here and were it not for the fact that there isn't an original moment on the album it'd get five stars. Practically everything about this band can be traced directly back to Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and perhaps Joy Division (I'm not really hearing the similarity with JD, but plenty of others are). So one star deducted.<BR>But these NY boys imitate their Brit forebears with self-awareness and talent. Stella and NWA are particularly fantastic songs, but the album really doesn't have a duff note. And they mark themselves out by adding a distinctively New York flavour in the dark humour of the lyrics. Impressive stuff.
B000002H6C|5.0|'...And Justice for All' is not only Metallica's most minimalistic album, but it's their best.  End of story.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I got this album for Christmas last year and found that it was even more than I expected.  Her first album was typical teeny pop, but this album did a lot more to set her apart from the rest.  Each song seems to have a feel all its own and her voice is divine.  I look forward to her next endeavor!  Definitely a must buy if you appreciate talent rather than hype.
B0000UMD00|1.0|I gave this album a chance, because I really liked &quot;Mizundastood&quot; and I thought it was great.  I can't stand Pink's views about animal rights, and I am sick of celebrities jumping on bandwagons for some extra publicity.  Pink is a loud mouth, and this album reflects her annoying, trashy self being annoying and trashy.  Even though I didn't like &quot;Trouble&quot; I thought I'd give it a chance anyways, based on past efforts.  &quot;Try This&quot; is a bad follow-up, and a shame to the recording industry.  This horrible effort is drippy, meaningless, and eye-rolling.  Trust me: don't &quot;try this&quot;, it will give you hives.  It is the worst album I've ever heard from a promising face in the music industry.  I wish I never wasted my money on this garbage.  I'd give it 0 if I could!
B00000IP3S|4.0|Blind Guardian is one of the few, if not only Power Metal Band that doesn't come off as total cheese.  They're lyrics are profound, their time excellent, and Hansi can growl(although it takes a bit to warm up to his voice).  One thing I've come to expect is that these guys never fail to let me down.  Imaginations is no different, it's quite a bit rougher than it's succesors Nightfall and Opera, but that's why its one of my favorites.<br />Imaginations from the Other Side - My all time fav. BG song.  It's fast, intelligent, and eerie.<br />I'm Alive - A killer song, the hardest on the album, and Ilove the little break off to the accoustic guitar.<br />A Past and Future Secret - The bardic stuff is nice, it's short, but nothing spectacular.<br />The Script for my Requiem - This is probably my least favorite song on here, it starts off really great, but just seems flat afterwards.<br />Mordred's Song - This song starts off kinda like A Past and Future secret, but comes off much heavier, a testament to BG's ability to mix bardic and metal into an awesome combo.<br />Born in a Mourning Hall - Another decent song, like alot have said it sounds muddy, but the lyrics are awesome.<br />Bright Eyes - Man I love this song, its deep and calm, but swift and vengeful, and Hansi vocals are awesome.<br />Another Holy War - Yay, more speed, with some spiffy lyrics. I often liken this bad boy to Brainwashed by Iced Earth, just not quite so dark.<br />And The Story Ends - A sweet closer, that wraps up the CD beautifully, Ilove the chorus.<br />The CD suffers from downfalls though, two of which seem to make each other worse. One, BG has tendacy to go over the top with their insturments and backing choir, and sometimes songs seem too noisy or muddy.  The other problem, the production value. On songs like Born in a Mourning Hall and Bright Eyes they simply don't sound clear.<br />If you've heard something from BG and liked it, this is an excellent album to add to your collection(the cover art rules).  If you listen to Iced Earth, Iron Maiden, Helloween, Old Metallica or Opeth odds are this is something to check out. Everyone else might want to try Opera first.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|There are albums that are good. There are albums that are great. There are albums with a few good songs.<BR>But this one tops them all.<BR>I have never heard a better album by anyone, though the other Strokes album &quot;Is This It&quot; comes close. As few the songs are, they are all magnificent. Brilliant. It's audio gold.<BR>Any more need to be said?<BR>If you'll bother to read this, bother to buy the album.
B000023VR6|5.0|The greatest thing about this CD are the many different rappers featured, nearly every song features somebody, that's amazing. I won't even name everyone, but you must know that's a great thing about the CD.<BR>\\"The Watcher\\" tells us about how time flows in rap business, \\"F*** You\\" is a sexual song featuring Snoop Dogg and Devin The Dude, \\"Still D.R.E.\\" tells us he hasn't changed since The Chronic CD, \\"What's The Difference\\" features Eminem and XZibit, the lyrics don't tell much, but it's a great song. \\"Forgot About Dre\\", featuring Eminem, has one of the best lyrics of this CD, \\"The Next Episode\\" features old friend Snoop Dogg, no need to say they both kick ass, \\"Let's Get High\\" is hot, \\"B**** N****\\" tells us a little about people in the streets, wrong people. Every track in here is highly enjoyable, but the best ones are above.<BR>This CD has the Clean and the Instrumental version too, but the explicit one is obviously the best. Clean rap CDs aren't rap, you loose so many things during the Clean process...<BR>Overall, this is one of the 10 best rap CDs ever, a must for any music fan, absolutely worth your money. Great beats, great lyrics. That makes a great CD.
0385335482|4.0|I picked up this book at a Walmart over thanksgiving (I needed something to distract me from the relatives). I actually didn't think the book would be that good, but after the first few pages, I could relate to the main character. Her ups and downs were a little similar to Bridget Jone's, but the money aspect clearly differentiated the plots...all-in-all: A pretty good read for a vacation...it was so darn funny!
0761957553|5.0|The advent of statistical software for the personal computer in the 1980s can be argued to be both a great advancement as well as a critical liability for the field of research. Statistical software has certainly made difficult analytical tasks easier to accomplish, enabling more people to benefit from the use of quantitative techniques. The ever-increasing speed of the personal computer allows researchers to conduct complex analysis in minutes that would have taken days to complete manually. However, with this increased speed and usability comes pitfalls. The ease and speed of statistical software has encouraged some researchers to take a shotgun approach to analysis by running large numbers of analyses instead of strategically selecting analyses guided by theory. Statistical packages also make it possible to run complex procedures that may be misapplied or misinterpreted by researchers without a solid understanding of statistical principles.<br />No book can stop unscrupulous researchers from supporting their hypotheses by cherry picking favorable results from hundreds of analyses conducted. Well-intentioned students and researchers, however, can turn to Andy Field's book Discovering Statistics using SPSS for Windows for the statistical background and guidance needed to appropriately select, execute, and interpret results.<br />Field's book bridges the gap between introductory/intermediate statistical textbook and software manual. This engaging, easy to read book leads the reader through: <BR>· Introduction to statistical models<BR>· Exploring data<BR>· Correlations<BR>· Regression<BR>· Logistic regression<BR>· Comparing means<BR>· ANOVA<BR>· Complex ANOVA<BR>· Repeated measures design<BR>· MANOVA<BR>· Exploratory factor analysis. <BR>Each topic of the book begins with an overview of the applicable statistical theory. The theory is presented in non-technical language and references numerous sources for readers wanting a more in-depth review. When background material does become technical, these sections are specially labeled to alert non-technical readers. Field focuses particularly on the statistical assumptions of each statistical technique and how to use SPSS to test for them.<br />Following the review of statistical theory, each topic includes one or more exercises. Readers are guided step by step through each analysis from dummy coding data, through entering in the necessary SPSS commands, to interpreting SPSS output.  An accompanying CD furnishes the data sets used in each exercise, allowing readers to work though each exercise and check results against the book. Through these exercises, Field shows how results can be misinterpreted without a thorough investigation of the data. Great pains are taken throughout the exercises to demonstrate the perils of blindly trusting SPSS output without understanding the theory and underlying statistical assumptions. <br />From this review, it is obvious that I greatly enjoyed reading the book. I assume that this book is intended primarily for students and practitioners without an extensive background in statistics. However, I found this book to be beneficial in reviewing concepts studied in graduate school more than ten years ago. Field accomplishes the difficult task of simplifying complex topics into everyday language without talking down to his readers. This book is perfectly suited for the non-statistical expert looking for guidance with running analyses with SPSS.
B0000025DT|5.0|This was the album that introduced me to ELO, first heard in a high school art class.  Despite it's obvious influences, I'd never heard anything like it before, and it wasn't long before I was spreading the word.  I've owned it on 8-track, cassette, album and cd, but I think that will have to do it for me.  Jeff Lynne's retirement account doesn't need any more of my money.  Although several of the songs, Telephone Line in particular, are getting somewhat long in the tooth, it's still a great listen start to finish.
158234082X|4.0|I purchased &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; expecting a tell-all expose on what REALLY goes on behind the kitchen door in the average restaurant. And the book absolutely delivers on that level. An added treat is that the book is also the often hilarious tale of Anthony Bourdain's personal journey from misguided youth, who took a job at a restaurant only after friends he was sharing a Summer getaway with during college got tired of him not covering his share of the expenses, to the executive chef at a fine French eatery in NYC today. The story of the single event that caused Bourdain to aspire to become a chef is almost worth the price of the book alone. <br />The most interesting chapter of the book is the \\"From Our Kitchen to Your Table\\" section, where Bourdain confirms many of your worst fears about restaurant dining. Some things I took away from this chapter include the advice never to order fish on a Monday (it is most likely at its least fresh state, having been delivered the previous Thursday to cover the weekend orders), never order your meat well-done (you are pretty well insuring that the chef is going to treat you to the absolute worst cut, figuring you won't notice the difference since it will be dry anyway), and don't be so sure that the bread the waiter or busboy brings when you sit down went straight from the oven to your table (it likely was recycled from another table who didn't eat it). <br />Bourdain is an engaging writer with a great wit. I was rarely bored during my reading of &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;. If, however, you are one who is easily offended by coarse language, consider yourself forewarned that this book has a lot of it. I personally wasn't offended by the language, but I did find myself occasionally annoyed when Bourdain would go overboard in describing what a wild and crazy lifestyle he's led.  Bourdain would often go on and on about all of the drugs he's done, how much he drinks and how tough and macho he acted in this situation or that situation. There is something inherently off-putting about someone constantly boasting about what a &quot;bad-boy&quot; he is. To Bourdain's credit, he can also be self-deprecating, particularly in the humorous story about how a dumb misunderstanding on his part during a job interview caused him to lose a great opportunity at an upscale steakhouse. Bourdain also devotes an entire chapter to a fellow, more successful, chef and explains the differences between the two of them that make this so. Overall, a very entertaining book that is easy to recommend.
B000002A46|5.0|This is one of the best Christmas albums ever. She delivers each of the songs is a new way. She rocks out these songs with her 5 octave range. <BR>     She sings the old traditional songs and makes it sound like it was made for her. She also has quite a few of new holiday songs to add to the collection, like the most famous &quot;All i want for Christmasis you&quot;. <BR>     I thought that her rendition of Holy Night was amazing. They way she interprets the song is absolutly mind blowing. <BR>     This CD is a MUST to have in your Holiday Collection....
0385504209|4.0|I was reluctant to read this only because I am not a fan of the &quot;thriller-type&quot; novels.  However, I caved after hearing numerous word of mouth recommendations and seeing it appear on several newspaper's &quot;Best of 2003&quot; lists.  Given that, I was expecting more substance than it had.  Read the book if you like thrilling page-turners and/or are a history buff (like me), but don't expect anything more.  The characters annoyed me!  And for a novel with feminist overtones, the main female lead was an idiot and a prude!  For a 32 year old &quot;woman of the world&quot; who was supposedly highly educated, she sure needed to be condescended to a lot by the other male leads (including one chapter in which the male lead comes achingly close to explaining to her the birds and the bees).  I groaned when the supposed justification for why she didn't speak with her grandfather (and only living family member) for 10 years was finally revealed.  And she had never been in Westminster Abbey even though she lived in London?  All of this grated on me, although I found the historical/theological story quite fascinating, so much so that I'm tempted to pick up some of the books referenced by the author.

6300268993|5.0|This is the film that proved that sequels can surpass the orignal. Both embellishing upon the magic of the original film and simultaneously moving the plot forward with a unique and brilliantly scripted story, \\"Superman II\\" deserves all of the acclaim that accompanied it. The plot: the three Kryptonian villains seen in the prolouge of the first film are released from their imprisonment in the Phantom Zone when Superman tosses a hydrogen bomb into outer space. They arrive on Earth,and their leader- General Zod (an outstanding Terrence Stamp, giving the performance that he is best remembered for today) makes it clear that he now rules the planet. Then Zod discovers that this fabled \\"Superman\\" he keeps hearing about is none other than the son of his hated nemesis Jor-El ( a bit of info given by Lex Luthor, once again played to perfection by Gene Hackman), and the battle to save humankind is underway. Along the way, we are treated to a magnificently handled subplot detailing the evolving romance between Superman and Lois Lane (In fact, I thought Margot Kidder was at her best here..usually she annoys me, but in this film she shows a sensitive side that makes it very easy to understand why the Man of Steel has fallen in love with her). Sporting top of the line visuals (the battle in Metropolis is breathtaking , even by today's standards ) , excellent writing and masterful direction by Richard Donner (yes, I know, Richard Lester is credited as director, but word is that Donner had pretty much finished most of the shooting on this picture before his dispute with Warner Bros. caused him to quit. Think I'm wrong? Compare this to \\"Superman III\\" , which was directed entirely by Lester), \\"Superman II\\" is the crown jewel in this franchise. The only other movie I've ever seen that comes close to adapting a superhero to the screen with such finesse (beyond the original \\"Superman\\", I mean) is the recent epic \\"Spider-Man\\". If you havent seen this, rent the dvd at once. If you have, then see it again. A masterwork!!!
B00008NRI8|4.0|Cute flick. Funny moments in it, Love Hugh and Sandra Bullock as always is great. Not a classic, but cute overall. The DVD commentary with Hugh &amp; Sandra made me laugh more than the movie. Great chemistry!!!
B0000E64TR|5.0|Like a great many listeners, I have been weighing whether it is time to \\"upgrade\\" my system to SACD.  If the SACD mix of this album is anything close to the quality of the included stereo version, I may be making the transition very soon.<BR>I have owned \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" in different formats; LP, cassette, the initial CD release, the remastered CD from a few years ago, and the Mobile Fidelity edition.  This version is on par with Mobile Fidelity's, if not it's equal. Again, there is a caveat...I do not have a SACD system at this time.  This remastered stereo version, however, sparkles with detail and musical dynamics. If you like Elton John, you will want to own his best album, and, consequently, the best sounding version of it.  Since Mobile Fidelity's release is out of print (not to mention more expensive), this is the one to buy...especially if you have or are going to upgrade to SACD.  An essential work.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is fantastic!<br />Being a big Buffy fan I was damn interested in Joss' follow up show and knowing little about it bought it as soon as it became available and I was not disappointed one bit.<br />It has everything - action, humour, evil corporations, evil government, evil crooks, gun slingers, war buddies and telepaths!  The writing is great, the production design is fantastic and Joss' skill as a director has come along in leaps and bounds.<br />From the first episode you can tell that this show was destined to be cancelled - it just has an air to it that you can tell (or maybe you just know already) but this air of desperation just to keep going just adds to the character of Mal in particular and the beauty, grace and humanity of the show as a whole.<br />I can't recommend this highly enough - buy it and fall in love for yourself!
B00009RDG9|4.0|Underrated thriller from William Friedkin, a taut, tense and even deep thriller about the human nature. Man is man's worst enemy.
B0000E1WKE|2.0|Now, if you have been a Whitney Houston fan since the beginning of her career, the first thing you would notice on this disc is the degradation of her voice.  It sounds as though she has lost the danty fluidity which gave her voice that soft yet powerful strength during the 90s.  Similarly, there are instances where it sounds as though it is such a struggle for her to belt the high notes.  The deepening and hoarsening of her voice are likely due to 1. her drug use  and 2. general vocal stress over the years.  <BR>Of course, the disc is not entirely disappointing.  Luckily, Joy to the World and Who Would Imagine a King were barrowed from the Preacher's Wife soundtrack to give listeners a taste of her voice when it was in top form.
6304698526|5.0|This is without a doubt the best car chase movie ever. Here we are 35 years later and not one movie has lived up to it and I don't think one ever will. Steve Mcqueen did most of his own driving in the 1968 ford mustang GT 390 through the streets of san francisco at speed well over 100 mph! It's good to have safety protocol's while making movies but they have become so tight that it will prevent a movie of this level from ever being made again. I recomend buying this dvd and cherishing it forever!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw Wicked when it was in previews on broadway.  After I saw it, I immediately wanted to own the soundtrack.  The story is both funny and charming as is the music.  Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth both have outstanding voices and are a great combination on stage.<br />I recommend anyone buy this soundtrack and if you get the chance, see the show!
B0000DD7NL|4.0|This CD is good, but it isn't up to par with Songs in A Minor.  I do hate being judgemental by comparing the two CD's, but the songs in her new CD seem to lack the inspiration that was so evident in Songs in A Minor.  With Songs in A Minor Alicia was able to project her emotion into her music, she did not do that in this album.  However, one thing that I do like is the hip-hop vibe that this CD exudes.  It is apparent in the song, &quot;Streets of New York&quot;, featuring Nas and Rakim (great blend of rap and soul).  The hip-hop vibe is also felt in &quot;Karma.&quot;  The best songs in this album, other than the overplayed &quot;you don't know my name&quot;, are &quot;Karma, Slow Down, Streets of New York&quot;, and &quot;So Simple.&quot;  These are the songs that I listen to over and over again, they're top notch.  But even the best songs in this album do not measure up to the songs in her previous album.  Songs in A Minor is an unparalelled CD, and we may never see another album that is that raw with talent.  Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not chastising Alicia, I still think she is the most talented artist out there.  She just didn't perform to her full capabilites in this album.  Regardless, the album is very good when you consider most of the second-rate substandard albums out there.  Much love.  She's still the greatest.
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown has written an excellent book.  His research is extremely well done.  However, the book tries, but does not, engage the well educated reader.  If one knows the history and the mythology surrounding the Medieval Templars and the Grail story, one is disappointed by the outcome of the book.  Otherwise, the book is well written and exciting.  There are a few things the book lacks but it is worth a read.  He could have carried some of his research into ancient Near Eastern history and archaeology and built a stronger foundation for his premise.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|My review refers to the UK version of the album.  I researched before I purchased the US version, and I am glad that I did.  I'm sure the US version is good, but it lacks some great songs that sum up the whole theme of the film.  <br />One major song missing from the US version is Billy Mack's 'Christmas Is All Around'.  How they missed this one, I'm sure I'll never figure out, but it is a major part of the entire movie.  On top of it, it's a great song, really fun to sing and dance around to, to get you in the holiday spirit!  <br />A couple of other songs worthy of mentioning before you purchase the US version and realize you made a mistake:  Otis Reddings 'White Christmas' (I've never heard this song sung quite like Otis does it, he updates a very classic song), Gabrielle's 'Sometimes' (soulful song, has alot of meaning), and two of Craig Armstrong's instrumental's 'PM's Love Theme' and 'Portugese Love Theme' (these two songs will remind you all over again of the feelings you felt while watching the movie on the big screen- hopefulness, happiness, and of course, love).<br />Now that I mentioned all but one of the songs that were forgotten on the US version, I'll tell you about the the final one.  It is an overplayed Mariah Carey Christmas song (I think she's the artist, I'm not a fan), sung by Olivia Olsen, 'All I Want For Chirstmas'.  The only thing that saves this song for me is that it is sung by Olivia Olsen, who is a very young girl with an amazing singing talent.  That is the only reason I appreciate the song being included on the CD.  <br />I also want to mention that even though the UK version is more expensive, if you go directly to Amazon.co.uk and order it from them, it's cheaper (I paid $19.04 total including shipping), and it is delivered in one week instead of two to three weeks on Amazon.com.  <br />To sum it all up, I love the soundtrack as much as I did the movie, it's upbeat, will get you singing and dancing, and hopefully into the holiday spirit!!!<BR>  <BR>** I am editing my review slightly because I did not realize, as most wouldn't until they actually purchased the US version or read a couple of the helpful reviews left by others, that Billy Mack and Olivia Olsen's songs were included on the soundtrack.  I do, however, still think that the UK version is the most complete ensamble because it does include those extra few songs I mentioned above.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The Return of the King soundtrack is truly the perfect finish to this wonderful trilogy. It differs from the first two soundtracks in that there is no single outstanding theme - until the final track.<br />Where Fellowship had 'The Bridge of Khazad Dum ', and Two Towers had 'Forth Eorlingas', much of the music in this third installment seems to be quite neutral in comparison, and a lot is remixing of original themes. However, this is not to say that there are not highlights in the music.<br />The fifth track, 'The Steward of Gondor', features the almost angelic vocal talents of Billy Boyd who sings a very sad and mournful theme. We are also treated to a short rendition from Viggo Mortensen in track 17, 'The Return of the King'.<br />The absolute highlight of the CD, however, would have to be the final track, 'Into the West' by Annie Lennox.<br />Put into context with the feature songs of the two previous soundtracks, 'Into the West' really does finish it off beautifully.<br />'May It Be' (sung by Enya for Fellowship) was a song full of bittersweet hope. 'Gollum's Song' (The Two Towers) was all about betrayal and despair. 'Into the West' marks the end of the long journey, the renewal of life and hope, and the end of all grief and pain.<br />The words are poignant:<br />'What can you see on the horizon?<br />Why do the white gulls call?<br />Across the sea a pale moon rises,<br />The ships have come to carry you home.'<br />This is the end of Frodo's journey, and he finally has the chance to find peace for himself. The music matches the mood perfectly, and is the most fitting end to this brilliant trilogy of music.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Play this album, close your eyes, and think nothing. This is the closest to musical nirvana anyone can get. I would have added humanly possible, but Radiohead are Gods. A band is defined by their music. If that is the criteria, OK Computer is immortal.<br />There is no need to go through the motions of rating every track. Each track earns a perfect 10.<br />If you don't own it, buy it now. I mean NOW!!
0345404475|4.0|If you have watched \\"Blade Runner\\" before reading PKD's story (like I did), you'll find they are very different indeed. \\"Do androids...?\\" is the inspiration behind Ridley Scott's movie, but this book has its rightfull place within the realms of good science fiction.<br />While the movie is very graphic, visual and dark (all those rainy nights and opulent clothing), the book seems like a mind-breaking experience. In fact, to fully understand the many layers contained between the lines, one reading is not enough. The novel itself is not that much graphic. Dick rarely describes settings, people, buildings, etc., leaving the reader's immagination to work full-time. In fact, is this science fiction? Yes, I think it is, not because of the science involved, but because of the revolutionary elements present in the story.<br />This is mental sci-fi; the main question of the book is: what defines a human being? Rick Deckard has to answer this question every time he retires a Nexus-6, all the time taking care not to loose his bearings of what he thinks a human being should be. This kind of complexity is what makes \\"Do androids...?\\" a great read, although I thought Dick's style a little too dry for my personal taste.<br />Grade 8.2/10
B00006V9A0|5.0|This is a great CD to buy if you're a new fan of Nirvana. Of course if you're going to become a true Nirvana fan, you MUST have most, if not all, of the CDs. To Fred Dursts Numbah One Fan, next time you think about writing a horrible review about any other band, GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT!! Even people that don't like Nirvana know that they came out and made CDs before Chevelle, Nickleback, Creed and any other band you mentioned. The people that have written reviews and have included some advice for you are just trying to help a poor, diluted soul like yourself to know what you're talking about before you open your mouth. Here's a little tip for you, you stupid jizzbucket. Next time you wanna trash a band, there's a little search engine on the top left corner. Drag down the little topic bar, and click Artist Name. Then type the name of the band that you know nothing about, and search. Then maybe you'll actually make some informative remarks about the band. You make true grunge fans sick and tired of hypocrits hating some bands, and actually having the nerve to mention American Idol in the same review as Nirvana?! Leave true grunge fans, and other music fans alone, and quit filling our heads with this bullsh*t that you call common sense.
B00005JM02|5.0|When I first saw Finding Nemo in the theaters, I was amazed of how many age groups could enjoy this picture. The story line was encompassing and taught lessons to children and adults alike. I cannot sit through the movie one time without commenting at the end about how wonderful the story line could touch so many aspects of life and emotion.<br />When I purchased the DVD I was even more amazed about the extras. There were hours and hours of information about the making of the movie as well as educational aspects of the types of fish and other animals that were represented in the movie. There were also games and and things for children to read and learn about current ocean issues like pollution.<br />A great buy for any member of the family.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|This collection is fabulous. All the best songs from the Beatles are here. The B-sides which were chosen are excellent. The only possible improvement might be some more Harrison's songs.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Very nice film, especially the action scenes. Also I liked combat figures. If you saw the matrix series and you liked them, I2m sure that you will like this movie.
B00000634J|5.0|This completely comprehensive set is the definitive Lennon. All the necessities (Imagine, Instant Karma!, Cold Turkey, Give Peace A Chance) are here with a few extras. All the songs are classic. This collection is great for any fan of Lennon (and Yoko). Including songs from all of Lennon's albums, this album is one of the best on the market.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This review actually pertains to the theater showing of the extended version, which I had the privilege to see on Sunday.  It honestly was a treat to see the extended version of the movie on the big screen, although I'm really looking forward to the various commentaries on the disks, as well as the other extras.<br />The extended version of the movie adds a lot of little scenes here and there that clarify and reinforce some key plot points.  I imagine I missed a few of them as well, but I was glad to see that the ending was drawn out a little bit and some loose ends were tied up in this version.<br />The scene that fascinated me the most was the Boromir flashback.  What I'd read about it claimed that it explained Faramir better.  Well, Faramir still wasn't really true to the character that Tolkien wrote, but his motivations were explained more clearly.  What was also clarified was what Boromir knew when he went to Rivendell.  I plan to re-watch Fellowship again with a different perspective on him.<br />I am so excited about this series and thrilled with the production that Peter Jackson has put together.  It's a class act all the way.
B00008X5J3|4.0|Skanky, spanky 'hos stretch their struttin' stuff across the screen from camera angles galore in this cheap-shot show.  Although the choreographer's SPREAD-'EM-WIDE obsession may pander to hetero males, it became cliche' in my book before the fourth crotch shot.  &quot;Chicago's&quot; embittered, cynical 'ho cliche's overpower the droopy, dreary, dreadful drag queens that dragged &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; to a two-star rating (see my &quot;cliche' hell&quot; review).  Only a fool loves in Chicago, and the 'ho leaves her footprint on his heart.  In contrast, Moulin Rouge howls love to an unholy death.  The &quot;splits&quot; were cliche' fodder in Chicago, but at least dancing was included.  Aside from an occasional hoof-stomp, that activity was edited out of Moulin Rouge to make room for emoting. Chicago has a future with my VCR.  I will not be insulted by Moulin Rouge again unless I am falsely arrested and subjected to that miserable movie to coerce a confession.  Chicago featured fantasy set to music.  Moulin Rouge's redundant grinding wail fits its name:  &quot;moulin&quot; means &quot;mill;&quot;  &quot;rouge&quot; is &quot;red&quot; for EMBARASSMENT.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I am EXTREMELY impressed with Britney's new cd. I was expecting something really cheesy but it has actually turned out to be quite entertaining. I have in my stereo 24/7. Way to go Britney!
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Oh how far the mighty have fallen.  It is really hard for me to give this album 1 star, but even 1 star is too generous.   Dream theater was once my favorite band of all time.  I listen to thousands of bands, but Dream Theater was always on top and set the standard with classics such as Images & Words, Awake(in particular), Change of Seasons, and Scenes From a Memory.  These days are gone, most likely forever.  \\"Train of Thought\\" is a lifeless shell of an album, proving once and for all that the magic of Dream Theater is dead.  Dream Theater is no stranger to releasing a bad album, but have always bounced back ... until now.  1997's \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" was a disaster to say the least, and outraged fans around the world.  The band got a well-deserved black eye for releasing this commercial, uninspired mess, and nearly broke up after the tour.  Fortunately, the band appeared to learn their lesson.  Two years later the band releases \\"Metropolis Part II: Scenes From a Memory,\\" one of the best prog metal concept albums of all time, right up there with \\"Operation Mindcrime.\\"  In 2001, the mediocre \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" is released, and is met with mixed reviews.  Some parts were bad, some parts were very bad, and some parts were brilliant.  2003 was their chance to redeem themselves once again, although this did not happen . . .  \\"Train of Thought\\" makes their previous album, \\"6DoIT\\", seem like a masterpiece.  Even \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" seems excellent compared to this, because at least the album still sounded like Dream Theater.  I hate to say it, but this album is very NU-metal based.  I hear a lot of new Metallica, Linkin Park, Staind, Godsmack, Korn, Tool, and other crappy bands such as these on this album, and it sickens me that I'm even REMOTELY reminded of this kind of garbage on a Dream Theater album.  When I hear LaBrie trying to rap like Kid Rock(!) on one of the songs, the awful truth really sinks in.  Dream Theater has sold out.    Anybody who gives this album a good review simply because \\"It's angry! It's brutal! It's heavy! It's fast!\\" is an idiot.  \\"St. Anger\\" was angry too, does that mean it was good?  Nope.  The band's only purpose for recording this album was to prove how fast and heavy they could play, melody and meaning be damned.  Petrucci and Portnoy are to blame here;  banging away chaotically on their respective instruments, it's apparent they don't even care what it sounds like, just as long as it's fast.  I am a fan of thrash, death, and black metal, so I have no problem with heavy music, as long as it sounds good and makes sense.  This album does neither.       As I am - Slow and boring.  The only thing I liked is the song fades in with the same tone \\"6 degrees\\" faded out on.  A nice touch, but the song was so forgettable, it's a miracle I even remembered this.      This Dying Soul - Wow, the title reflects the spirit of the band, another nice touch, although I'm sure it wasn't intentional.  Here's where the album really shows its true colors.  Mindless, angry music throughout the entire song, while LaBrie is forced to have his voice distorted in the same way it was on \\"The Great Debate\\" off of \\"6DOIT.\\"  Why disguise a talented singer's voice?  Another great idea from this stumbling band.  Anyways, a very long and dumb song.      Endless Sacrifice - The chorus is 90% of the reason why people call this Nu-metal.  It is the first thing that comes to mind when listening to this song.  Absolutely terrible.  Moving on...    Honor Thy Father - LaBrie raps.  What else needs to be said? This is probably the worst song on the album, both lyrically and musically.  I didn't think Dream Theater even had this in them.  I was proven wrong, what a shame.      Vacant - The wannabe balance track on the album.  LaBrie's big, and only, lyrical contribution.  The result is a couple lines of lyrics, all very generic and simple.  Think harder next time, James.  Musically, it's slow and empty, not even capableof making the listener feel the depressed mood of the song.      Stream of Consciousness -  The only good song on the album, and coincidentally, it's the only song without lyrics or singing.  That's right, the only good song is an instrumental.  The song is about 3-4 minutes longer than it needs to be, which results in the song dragging in several places.  However, it's the only thing this album has going for it, although it hardly redeems all the bad that has already been heard.  But wait, the album isn't over yet!    In the Name of God - A super long song about nothing.  NOTHING!  There's nothing worthwhile in this song, I don't know why people praise this so much.  I have trouble staying awake through this one!  Just drags on forever, I couldn't wait until it was over.    I sincerely hope this album was just a fast paycheck for the band, because this is in no way indicative of the band's talents.  They said it themselves, it took 3 weeks to put this thing together, and it shows.  If you are new to Dream Theater, stay very far away from this one, and pick up their first 2 albums, and Scenes from a Memory after that.   If you are into crap Nu-metal than this is the album you've been waiting for.  For real metal fans, don't even waste your money.  Hopefully this is the band's rock bottom and they rise again.
B000066NW0|1.0|This has to be one of the most disgraceful records to come around in the past couple of years. When I first heard of Avril, I had some respect for her. I thought, a girl who can play guitar, write her own songs, wear clothes, and has a bit of vocal talent. But man was I EXTREMELY wrong. First off all, although Avril sounds decent during recording, its because she has computer in enhancement. How do I know this? She SUCKS live. She can hardly even play guitar, besides for a few basic chords that took me two minutes to learn. ALthough, it seems like she writes her own stuff, it you look at all the credits, other people wrote the songs for her and she changed a few words. The few songs that you can tell she wrote are ones with lines like, \\"You stand like a stone, alone in your zone.\\" Please, I could write better than that in 2nd grade. And although she wears cloths unlike other pop stars, she wears cheesy 'punk' hot topic clothes that was clearly a marketing scheme. Look at all of her old pictures and see how 'punk' she looks. She also claims to have punk music when all she sings about is love, with annoying pop tunes. Very hard core indeed.<BR>The only redeeming quality about Avril is that she does show young girls that you don't have to walk around in underwear to get attention.<BR>She should try just being herself, and not invading on a tradition that is real to many people. Stop being a poser Avril. And if you're going to be famous, atleast learn how to sing.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I love this movie and the extraordinary trilogy but I wanted to know when it will come out on DVD. The Wachowski brothers have such imagination,wow!, i mean(wohoa)!!!There should definitely be another Matrix movie, maybe Matrix Reunion(s), where Neo returns as the biblical figure and savior of Zion with Morpheous and Niobi and a little Morpheous maybe, hahah. At least Niobi (Jada Pinkett Smith) thinks so as well. All in all, what a great movie.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I soo LOVE this album.... This dude means what he sings and you can truly tell, he will be around for a long time.... I love the whole album, which is hard to come by..... Also very rare all songs are written by Gavin DeGraw which also rocks.... Lets hope more singers come along as talented and awesome as Gavin DeGraw.... Keep On Rocking!!!!
B00005U122|5.0|Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters' genius as a lyricist has not been disputed (except by a few misguided, ill-informed David Gilmour fans) but his work as a performer has always been something of a mystery to the casual Floyd/Waters fan who could not see him in the stadium monstrosities staged by Pink Floyd or in Waters' relatively intimate (but rare) live performances. This DVD displays Waters' mastery of the visualization which give purchase to his poignant, intelligent lyrics and melodies. Waters' voice, a unique rock and roll treasure, is in fine form and shared by talented sidemen and women with whom Waters graciously grants stage and vocal time. The set pieces, the lighting and the structure of the show make this a must-have for all Floyd fans. It is also a nice introduction to Waters' brilliant solo work, though I honestly wish he had chosen different tracks from &quot;Radio Kaos&quot; and &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking.&quot; The former would have been better served by &quot;Sunset Strip&quot; and the latter by the title track. No matter. There are no throwaways here--as a matter of personal taste, I just wish this song-packed concert had featured more from &quot;The Final Cut&quot; and less from &quot;Animals.&quot; The DVD extras are great, giving a glimpse into Waters as a human being, but sparing us the usual trite tripe you get with many such &quot;backstage peeks.&quot; Waters was the heart and soul of Pink Floyd and &quot;In the Flesh&quot; is a triumph for This Man Behind Pink Floyd's Curtain. This DVD will demonstrate just how shiny and souless Gilmour's Pink Floyd is without Waters at the helm. Have A Cigar and get this DVD.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|This album just rocks, P!NK gets better everytime... I love how each album is a major change.... Awesome songs that I like are: Last To Know, Tonights The Night, Save My Life, Walk Away.... There isn't a bad song on the whole album... Keep On Rocking!!!
B0000C7PQK|3.0|Overall, this was a good album.  Songs like &quot;Boum Boum&quot;, &quot;Look of Today&quot;, &quot;The Piano&quot;, and &quot;Following the Sun&quot; made me want to get it.  But compared to MCMXC A.D., The Cross of Changes, Lei Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!, and The Screen Behind the Mirror, it just doesn't work as well.  Still O.K. though.
B0000640S1|4.0|The most important thing to keep in mind when watching \\"First Blood\\" is not that this 1982 film was Slyvester Stallone's second most successful series after the Rocky films, but that at that point in pop culture history the Vietnam vet had essentially replaced the Nazi as the default villain in a lot of movies and television shows.  The idea was that you took somebody with military training and set them off because (a) they did drugs in Nam, (b) were exposed to Agent Orange, (c) went crazy under the pressure, (d) were rejected by their government and the American people when they got home, or (e) any combination of the above.  In that light, \\"First Blood\\" was one of the few films to present a Vietnam vet as a hero.  John Rambo was moody and mentally unstable, in a trained killing machine sort of way, but he had a sense of honor and only struck back when pushed too far.<br />The rule of thumb is that a movie succeeds more on the villain than the hero, and that holds true in this case, with Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle, who does not take a liking to a the moody, shaggy haired, Rambo when he wanders through town.  Teasle take Rambo into custody and tries to show him who is boss, but has a deputy sergeant (Jack Starrett) who takes things to far.  Rambo snaps, easily escapes from the police station, and the massive manhunt hunt is on.  The only problem is that Teasle and all of his men are no match for an unarmed Rambo, who quickly finds a way to arm himself.  Teasle has some understanding of how his men are culpable in what is going on, but stubbornly insists that the rule of law should still apply, even when Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives right behind the National Guard to explain how big of a mistake the locals have made.<br />The main problem with this film is that there were sequels, which buried the strengths of the original under big budget gloss (a charge that can be leveled against the Rocky series as well).  Beyond that the main complain would be that once events have been put into play and we all acknowledge that Rambo has been done wrong, the politics of the situation gives way to the action.  As such, the politics become an excuse for the violence, which is one of those things that would be ironic on so many levels.  Then, at the end, when the movie becomes political again, it seems rather uncomfortably forced and Rambo's articulation of the very real plight of a lot of Vietnam vets becomes exceedingly forced (actually, at the end of this film, after being moody and silent for most of the film, Rambo talks a LOT).  The best of the action sequences is when Teasle and his cops (including a relatively young David Caruso), try to track down Rambo in the woods, mainly because it relies more on stealth and intelligence than big guns and bigger explosions.  Against a Green Beret these boys have no chance and when Rambo offers Teasle one last chance to let it go, and when the Sheriff refuses, all of our sympathies go to Rambo.<br />The message of \\"First Blood\\" might be forced, but it is hard to turn in a stern indictment of the film on that basis given what was happening with Vietnam vets in Hollywood.  Even in this heavy-handed effort you have to admit there was an attempt at a noble motive.  Special mention should be made of the audio commentary on the DVD version by David Morell, who wrote the novel on which the film was based.  Morell is an interesting choice simply because he was not really involved in the production of the film, but this has some interesting payoffs, such as the argument that \\"First Blood\\" changed the action genre as one of the first movies to feature a brief set-up and then pretty much non-stop action for the rest of the film.  There are some tidbits about the film (Kirk Douglas was originally cast as Colonel Trautman) and how the ending was changed when audiences were upset that Rambo was killed.ain would be that once events have been put into play and we all acknowledge that Rambo has been done wrong, the politics of the situation gives way to the action.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is by far the best representation of realistic space travel.  It just looks like this would happen.  People on worlds that are forgotten, plagues, run down space ships.  It is totally believable... just not to those who thought it was necessary to cancel.  At least I got it on DVD, it's great!
B000002I6T|5.0|This album is genius, and I'm not only saying that because it is like a concept album for an acid trip. I mean, so is Ummagumma, and that's not in my pantheon. Crosby really transcended everything he'd done before with this glorious freak flag of an album. The songs are like psychedelic meditations on birth, death, love and justice. &quot;Well, the strangest thing I've seen, is a T-shirt turning green, In India, a turtle dove. The dove's lady was the cause, or maybe it was the olive branch she held in her jaws, or maybe he could see they were in love.&quot; And that lyric was based on a Vietnam War protest march. &quot;I'd Swear There Was Someone Here,&quot; the mind-massaging vibes played by Neil Young on &quot;Music is Love.&quot; Tripped out genius and the perfect way to end the less-than-glorious, failed-to-live-up-to-its-hype flower-power, Haight-Ashbury 1960s.<br />P.S. I've heard that Warner Music is preparing a remastered reissue of this LP with added tracks. Any truth to that?
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have seen the Broadway Musical and loved it!!! I have been counting the days for this CD to be released. I pre-ordered it when I saw the show. They actually shipped a little early so I have been listening to it since Dec. 13th (3 days before the official release). Some of the best songs are &quot;The Wizard and I&quot;, &quot;Dancing Through Life&quot;, &quot;Popular&quot;, &quot;I'm Not That Girl&quot; and &quot;Defying Gavity&quot;. Kristen Chenoweth is very bubbly and funny(perfect actress for Glinda...excuse me...Galinda), especially in &quot;Popular&quot;. The cast performed &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; (which is the BEST number in the show) on The David Letterman Show a while ago. It is a phenomenal number, but don't judge it from TV. You MUST see it in person. Idina Menzel shines in her role as Elphaba (the Wicked Witch). Her voice hits it's peak in &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;...she is &quot;unlimited&quot; (see the show). So, bottom line, I HIGHLY recommend the CD as well as HIGHLY recommending going to see the show. I know I will...again!
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|I loved this movie and the soundtrack.  As soon as I left the movie theatre I went straight to Wal-Mart and brought this CD.  The same feeling I had during the movie I have everytime I hear this CD.  I think I like track 3 - Sweetest Goodbye/Sunday Morning the best but track 17 (bonus track) just made me smile when I heard it (if you've seen the movie, you will know why!!)  Kelly Clarkson tears up track 1.  Great way to get started.  The only down song is track 8-Jump.  Although it was 'cute' in the movie, it doesn't really fit the mood the other songs gives.<br />Even if you don't see the movie (which you must) this is a wonderful CD for just veggin' out to on a cold winter evening with someone special or just yourself.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Once again Madonna has captured the hypocrasy of America, this time in 2003. Of course this album seems self-absorbed -- THAT'S THE POINT! As a society, America is the most spoiled, selfish culture you could possibly imagine. As individuals we are sensitive, caring people who want to fix the insensitivity and injustice around us. This album taps into those feelings.<br />I think this may be one of Madonna's strongest over-all albums with no one piece dominating over the others. Sometimes listening to this album makes me uncomfortable, other times it's a relief that the ideas are explicitly stated somewhere in our pop culture. This definitely has a place among the albums I listen to regularly.
0792840461|5.0|Once again, why did they ever even think of remaking this movie?  Steve McQueen is at his best in his portrayal of Thomas Crown, a wealthy genius who is a mastermind for constructing elaborate bank robberies.  I really enjoyed the music in this film, particularly the way it interacts with the director's (Jewison) use of split screens.  While it's a dated technique, it really helps move the plot along without unnecessary cutting.  Additionally, the anonymity of his accomplices and the way that several loose ends come together to form the perfect robbery is best captured by this technique, in my opinion.<br />Beyond McQueen's powerful performance, Faye Dunaway blows Rene Russo's remake performance out of the water.  Dunaway is smart, sexy, and knows how to handle herself.  While it's a bit slow in some parts, this movie is a psychological piece that focuses primarily upon the \\"cat and mouse\\" interplay between McQueen and Dunaway.  This is a \\"battle of wits\\" movie-not a pure action flick, as the remake might have you believe.  The ending is also extremely well done.  Rather than end on a typical Hollywood note, the final scenes of this film will leave you perplexed and wanting more of this film.  With one of the longest screen kisses I've ever seen and the famous \\"chess\\" sequence, this film is a classic that definitely belongs in your video library.

B0000640S3|3.0|While I'm not a big fan of the two sequels to \\"First Blood,\\" I do believe that \\"Rambo III\\" is a better film than \\"Rambo: First Blood Part II.\\"  I do not criticize it for its historical awkwardness-one must judge the movie from when it was made and not by all of the things that have happened since that time.  Simply put, in the last film Rambo fought the country of Vietnam and the Russians.  In this film, he takes on the Russians in Afghanistan.  The action is better in this film than the previous one and I was more entertained.  Aside from the action aspects, however, the dialogue is even more pathetic than the second one.  This is, of course, with the exception of the monologue one of the Afghanistan rebels makes.  But the dialogue has been minimized in this film to a ridiculous level-there is hardly any talking at all.  That's okay, however.  All I really wanted to see was Rambo and that big knife anyhow.<br />I was also interested in the final stage of character development the writers tried to pull off in the first couple of minutes.  Trautman tries to convince Rambo that he is nothing more than a fighting machine-a killer.  One would think, or hope, that John's mentor would have higher hopes for him.  Instead, he reduces Rambo to nothing more than a killing machine.  Sure, he's a character that overcomes oppression to bring brutal justice to thousands.  But he is still nothing more than a killing machine.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|As a huge Sarah McLachlan fan, I bought this cd the day it came out, put it in my car and almost started crying from hearing her beautiful voice again.  When I listened to the whole cd, I was slightly disappointed at some of the songs, but the more and more I've listened to this cd, all of it has grown on me.  I find myself getting the lyrics from my less favorite songs stuck in my head!  While no cd can ever top FTE which i can listen to for hours on end and never get sick of, I think this album is even better than Surfacing.  Granted it probably will not have as many hit songs, however it's more upbeat and there's a lot more going on musically.  My personal favorites are Time, Perfect Girl, Fallen, Stupid, and World on Fire.  Don't give up on this cd after just a couple of listens, it will grow on you!
6305657947|3.0|Once again, I am completely perplexed as to why they remade this film.  On top of that, why did they decide to turn an intelligent \\"cat and mouse\\" movie into a mind-numbing action film?  While I was amply entertained, I had to completely detach myself from the original in order to enjoy it.  One scene of note, however, is the final heist scene-spectacular action and extremely entertaining.<br />They have weakened the incredibly strong character that Steve McQueen created.  In this remake, Thomas Crowne solicits the help of a psychiatrist (really just a ploy to pull Faye Dunaway into a cameo role) in order to help him sort out the troubles he has with Rene Russo.  Steve McQueen needs no such crutch to get him through.  In a similar manner, Russo is not nearly as compelling as Dunaway-her character is much more fragile and less complex than the original.  I was very disappointed to see the wonderful characters from the original collapse at their knees and fall in the dust.  As interesting as the action is, the lack of character interest is a definite turn-off.<br />Do yourself a favor: see the original.  And if you do watch this film, watch it before you see the original or you will be disappointed.  That way, you can end on a high note.
0689859368|1.0|This series is intended for children ages 8 to 12.  Book One is fairly entertaining and age appropriate, BUT Book Two is totally unacceptable for this age group.  It contains graphic violence towards animals (there's even an illustration of it!).  The children will either be traumatized by it or intrigued by it, both of which is VERY BAD!  The bad fairies catch a domestic cat and roast it on a spit over an open fire!  A nice bedtime story for ten year olds!!!  Skip these books and try these series: Chet Gecko Mysteries, Animal Ark Series, Secrets of Droon, Magic Tree House and A to Z Mysteries.  Also books by Eager, Estes, Eva Ibbotson, R. Dahl, Judy Blume, George Selden, E.B. White and Beverly Cleary.
B00006AG5N|3.0|I loved the selection - that's why I bought this CD.  Unfortunately, this CD does not play on a DVD player. So if you're used to listening to music on your pc - it won't work.  I've gotten this CD twice and no luck either time.
B00013F35I|5.0|Bruce Springsteen and the E St band puts on a great performance during their show taped live in Barcelona . I'm a big fan of THE BOSS since my early age and I have to say it's one of the most Joyfull concerts I've ever seen on a screen (unfortunetly I never saw him live). During the whole concert he's singing playing Guitare and Piano he's THE LIVING LEGEND. And above all he's never tired and you feel he's giving it from his soul. The confindence he portray adds enjoyment to watching this concert, while the E st Band is on the Edge of a great performance. The only disappointment for me, not being able to watch them perform live! But hopefully I will one day ! Great Job BOSS keep on Rockin !!!!!!!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|At the time that I am writing this review, Firefly is ranked #21 on the top sales for Amazon. That's #21 out of hundreds of thousands of items. So, tell me again why Fox cancelled this show?<br />Apparently, the country music theme song scared off a few people...which is too bad. Because it really is one of the best science fiction shows ever to air on television. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for the Star Trek franchise and I think that Gene Roddenberry was great. However, as an avid consumer of science fiction television, movies, and books, I feel strongly that Firefly far surpassed Star Trek.<br />It has all of the elements that I look for when searching for a science fiction book, movie or show: interesting stories, action, adventure, humor, and people I care about. Captain Malcolm Reynolds is one of the greatest space ship captains ever (Captains Kirk and Picard notwithstanding).<br />I can't believe that Fox cancelled this show. At the time Firefly aired, they were running encore shows of Fastlane on Fox AND MTV. (If you missed this week's episode of Fastlane, see it again at ...) Firefly was in the worst possible timeslot (Fridays at 8:00) and they never advertised it EXCEPT during the show itself. If they had supported it half as much as they had supported the now cancelled Fastlane, or The O.C., Firefly would have been a huge success.<br />Review of the DVD: don't let what appears to be low-budget packaging scare you. The content on the DVD set is excellent. And the new episodes (that were filmed but never aired) were well worth the wait. Buy this DVD now to show Joss Whedon and the cast that you support them. Hopefully, the DVD sales will show Fox what a mistake they made in cancelling this show and give it another chance. If that doesn't work, maybe the Firefly film Joss is writing will.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was so disappointed when Firefly was cancelled and absolutely overjoyed when I learned they were releasing the entire series on DVD, including 3 episodes I had never seen. I bought the box set just a few days ago and have already watched all 14 episodes. This series has everything- an interesting plot, fascinating three dimensional characters and a fantastic setting. Fox made a big mistake when they cancelled it. I don't know why they didn't give it a better chance to succeed. It was mishandled from the very beginning- I won't go into the details, but Fox basically shot themselves in the foot here.<br />Anyway, I would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys character development, humor, drama, romance, action, adventure, etc.<br />There's only one downside-after watching all the episodes offered, you're left wanting more. Each character has a mystery in their past and none are solved in this box set-which is maddening, I admit. But what's there is so good, it's worth the aggravation of being left hanging. AND I've heard distant rumors that a Firefly movie may be in the works!
B00009W0WM|5.0|One of the all-time favourite Hollywood movies may well have found its definitive presentation in this superb double DVD Special Edition set. The picture quality of this new digital transfer is downright stunning and easily surpasses all previous DVD releases. The sharpness and the rich contrast reveal the plasticity and the expressive quality of the image in an unsuspected dimension. To take but that example, the studied close-up shots of Ingrid Bergman's face are simply breathtaking. The sound is mastered perhaps a little low, but with the volume turned up sufficiently, proves clear and flawless.<br />The extras alone would already be worth the investment. There are two interesting, complementary commentaries by film historian Rudy Behlmer and critic Roger Ebert. Especially Ebert's narration will learn you a lot about what you actually see on the screen. (Watch for the midgets around the plane in the closing scene). There is a fine documentary on Humphrey Bogart presented by Lauren Bacall and on disc 2 Stephen, son of Humphrey Bogart and Pia Lindström, daughter of Ingrid Bergman evoke how their parents experienced Casablanca. In \\"You Must Remember This: A Tribute to Casablanca\\" one gets a complete view of the production. Finally, there are trailers, biographical sketches, scoring stage sessions, and even (silent) outtakes and additional scenes.<br />In short, Casablanca gets what it deserves and this DVD set should figure in every serious movie collection.
079070546X|5.0|I first saw Christmas vacation when I was very young and ever since then, my family has watched it every Christmas, and we still laugh hysterically along during Clark Griswald's &quot;Family Christmas&quot;. A stunningly funny cast, great story line, and of course a wonderful soundtrack (that we can seem to never find) make this truely a holiday tradition that my family has enjoyed for a very long time. With out a doubt, Christmas Vacation is the best holiday movie I've seen, and it just isn't Christmas until we watch it!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is an incredible album, it's been said Britney is falling, but with this record she proves us that she is stronger than ever. All of the songs of this album are great, it is not difficult to see that she worked very hard for this record. With this album you can dance, cry, be happy, scream, everything. <BR>Another great thing is that the content of this album is more mature, you get touched by the songs. I mean I love ALL of the songs, the best ones are: &quot;The Hook Up&quot;, &quot;Early Mornin'&quot; and &quot;Outrageous&quot;.<BR>For the Fans it is very good, because they get to know the very real Britney, The one that has been through alot of difficult experiences, and is not afraid to show the world who she really is.<BR>I cannot say there are bad songs in this album because there aren't. <BR>People should buy the album because you can enjoy it and she just never disappoints people.
B00006JMXH|1.0|can anyone tell me if this cd is in english?<BR>I know that might sound like a dumb question,<BR>but I'm not sure and it's a stocking stuffer.<BR>Thanks, Arleen
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There were 200+ plus positive reviews here yesterday...Hmm.<br />Anyway. If you are hearing any kind of buzz about this series, you should buy the set. It is an excellent show with multidimensional characters and excellent stories. I really can't rave enough about this collection. You really should check it out for yourself. It's money well spent
0783225903|1.0|I put one star on this review to GET THE ATTENTION of people like myself, who find most movies bad. I always look for the worst reviews. To me, though, Brazil is the best. <br />But, dammit, forget what I or anyone else says -- just like you have to forget idiotic rules about what the &quot;stars&quot; on a review mean -- and decide for yourself.<br />I saw 'Brazil' first in 1986 or so. I thought it was good, but it was preaching to the choir ... I already knew how miserable modern life is.<br />It's the end of 2003 and I just saw it again for the first time in 17 years, and I'm shocked at how hilarious it is! Much funnier, and much more from the heart, than the serious young man thought.<br />See it. And if you're an old geek like me, you'll love the set design. The old equipmnent is aging really well! As is the movie.
B000008HZB|5.0|Jeff Lynne is one of those musicians that you can't help but notice after awhile.  I loved ELO, particularly the Discovery album.  Later, I really got into the soundtrack from Electric Dreams.  Then I got into something else and realized that Lynne's name was stamped on all of them.<br />He is a master of a certain sound and this album showcases it.  Some of the songs are reminiscent of ELO to me (Don't Say Goodbye, Every Little Thing, Save Me Now) but mixed with widely differing sounds.  Nobody Home is great - has somewhat of an r & b feeling to it.  Don't Let Go has a little r&b and maybe a Buddy Holly type tempo.  Now Your Gone has piano rifts and Hindu-esque laces like those used in some of the later Beatles music that was almost certainly George Harrison's influence - makes for a beautiful and mournful tune. Then he takes classics like Stormy Weather and September Song and brings them up from the earlier part of this century and makes them young and fresh with his distinctive sound.<br />Absolutely fantastic - a genuine genuis.  All of the songs are good.  If you like ELO, this is even better.  If you like George Harrison's solo work, you'll probably love this. Overall, it has kind of a synthetic bluesy, jazzy pop tempo kind of sound. Lyrics are fantastic. How do you define genius?
B000002UWL|5.0|This CD has to be PSB's most emotionally revealing.  This album was made during the turmoil surrounding the fall of the Berlin Wall, and it is well expressed in the Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe's lyrics throughout.  All of the songs are great except for a couple such as TO FACE THE TRUTH and NERVOUSLY.  These two songs seem like fillers between others that are far greater.  The best songs on this CD are BEING BORING, HOW CAN YOU EXPECT..., THIS MUST BE THE PLACE..., and of course, OCTOBER SYMPHONY.  OCTOBER SYMPHONY is really exceptional....just because it is Tennant's coming to terms with the European demise of Communism....at least for the moment.  What an interesting song....   Behavior is great for any PSB fan...and a really good one for the beginner as well.  Go ahead and give it a chance!
B000000IRR|5.0|The attached is arguably the best CD Steely Dan completed prior to their breakup or since.<br />This is the Mobile Fidelity 24Karat Gold Version in the orignial shrink wrap.<br />A truly outstanding piece of jazz inflected rock/pop that is simply hard to beat if you are a fan. The sound is superb thanks to MFSL technology and remastering and ranks right up there with the Super Audio Version on the SACD Layer.<br />This item is a collectible and you may find it periodically on Ebay for significantly more money and in U.S. $'s.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|As an Alien fan, the I would have been perfectly happy to pay the same amount of money for this set's bonus discs alone. Each movie is paired with its own dedicated bonus disc full of behind the scenes footage and new interviews, photo archives, concept artwork, 1st draft scripts... it's enough to make an old fanboy like me weep like a little girl.<br /><br />Aside from the wealth of information presented here, there's something else that I appreciate just as much: the unflinching candor in the interviews. Usually when you watch behind the scenes talking head interviews with cast and crews, everything they say is through a sunshine filter, praising their comrades with every other breath, making it sound like the movie was made by a troop of saints and Good Samaritans. Not so here. If a writer had a problem with one of the producers, you'll hear about it, sneers and all. (Dan O'Bannon has always been a hero of mine, and now he's even more so. How can you not love this bitter old crank?) James Cameron has a reputation for being a big jerk on the set, and here you'll find out why. Alien 3 wasn't a successful installment of the series, and no one tries to skirt that issue here; they go into great detail to explain the process of how the project was born with a lot of potential and was then pounded down into mediocrity by a handful of studio execs with no imaginiation or vision. Vincent Ward, the original \\"first choice\\" director for Alien 3 has a lot to say, but David Fincher, the sore loser that he is, stubbornly and petulantly refused to appear here. I really would have loved to hear his side of the story, being a Fincher fan. I've lost a smidgen of respect for him now. I haven't even started on the Alien Ressurection bonus disk or the final all encompassing disk 9, and I haven't watched any of the movies in the set yet. I will though, if I can ever finish these other extras...
B0000AQS0F|4.0|...just trying to keep gas in the tank and food on the table by salvaging, smuggling, stealing - whatever pays good without hurting anybody (intentionally).<br />A small group of people crew a transport ship named &quot;Serenity&quot;(with no guns or lasers) that the captain loves like a car enthusiast might love his '57 Chevy. If Star Trek's &quot;Enterprise&quot; (pick any version) can be compared to a CD stereo, then &quot;Serenity&quot; could be compared to an 8-track tape player. But that lovable bucket-of-bolts ship is their lifeline of daily survival in space and on the western-themed planets on which they do business. There's a price on their heads, so they have to operate slightly outside of the law, but they always manage to eke out a livin' somehow while remaining free.<br />There's lots of subtle and outright humor throughout almost every episode (and weirdness like characters speaking Mandarin Chinese at odd times), but that's THE main thing that ties it all together so well. The characters never take themselves too seriously and, when they ain't a squabblin', usually cover each other's backs (but not always). The western flavor comes and goes, so it sometimes plays as more of a straight-forward sci-fi series than a cowboy comedy, but the perils they get into generally tend towards funny and less towards tragic. There are a couple of episodes, however, that are darkly serious.<br />Try not to get too attached to this 14-episode space soap opera because it's over before you know it. It wasn't supposed to be cancelled so soon, so the storylines were never totally resolved, but it was good fun while it lasted. You might find yourself shedding a tear during the last playing of that haunting theme song. Sob.
B000089RVX|5.0|If you mixed Sarah Maclachlan and Linkin Park together, you would get Evanescence.  Amy Lee's voice sounds very similiar to Maclachlan in certain songs, particularily  &quot;My Immortal.&quot; That song, and &quot;Hello&quot; are two of the saddest songs I've heard this year.  &quot;Bring Me Back To Life&quot; is perhaps the most overplayed song on the radio this year but it tells you that the listeners want to hear it.  It took me a while to come around and finally buy this CD but I'm glad I did.  One minor annoyance is the 2 versions of &quot;My Immortal&quot;... the music video has the full band whereas the CD just has the &quot;quiet&quot; version.  I hate it when artist do this and it is not fair to the listeners. I'm guessing that the band didn't want the video to be the Amy Lee show.  I hope guitarist/co-founder Ben Moody rejoins the band.  Definitely one of my favorite CDs of the year.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I tend to be somewhat picky about what I watch, and was skeptical about all the good things I kept hearing about Firefly.  But, I decided $35 was a small risk.  I was not disappointed.  This shows is simply  amazing.  There is no other dvd to which I have given a 5 start rating.  This show is worth the $35 and then some.  It is intelligent, witty, humorous, exciting, and original.  While shows like star trek seem to be about exploring space, Firefly is more about surviving it.  IMO, this show represents the next generation of sci-fi programming.
B0000B3B95|3.0|Surprisingly, Ang Lee's first film after \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" has the same deliberate pacing and gracefulness that that film did.  Most of the comic book films of our era have a set formula: big, explosive action, tongue-in-cheek caricatures, and plainly linear plots.  Usually their best assets are the villains - psychopathic killers like Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin and Jack Nicholson as Joker - or the mysteries, like the shady Wolverine in the \\"X-Men\\" trilogy.<br />\\"Hulk\\" was ripe for divergence, though, and Ang Lee knew it.  The Hulk is his own villain, a bizarre menace to himself, his girlfriend and the United States military.  He is the manifestation of pure emotion, a metaphor for the real monster within all of us.  Of course, this \\"thematic ore\\" has been mined dozens of times before, so you'll be wise not to expect much originality here.<br />The cast is great.  Eric Bana covers both the American accent and the introverted scientist role of Bruce Banner with ease.  Nick Nolte is at his fiery best as Banner's haunted father, and Jennifer Connelly, who doesn't quite impress me in any of her roles, is fine here.  Sam Elliot borders on camp in his enraged portrayal of an American general caught between his country and his daughter, but it's all well and good because director Lee mixes things up with fractured visual styles and plenty of CG eye-candy.<br />This \\"Hulk\\" isn't flawless; the film is a bit too long and drives in the themes a little more than it should.  The climactic battle seems energetic and frenetic, but empty.  And the simple plotline gets twisted and tangled more than it can handle.  But, considering the cartoonish level to which some of these movies have sunk, \\"Hulk\\" keeps the violence to a smart level and lets the characters speak for themselves.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have turned three of my friends on to this series and each of them asked me the same thing.  How on earth did this show get cancelled?  Well, I do not know.  But I do know that it is truly a great piece of work.  It is witty and funny.  Best of all, it brings a fresh and long overdue perspective to the Science Fiction genre.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I don't know what folks are griping about, as this CD sounds exactly like Sarah always sounds. (And that's a good thing.) The  emotive, mellifluous voice is still there; the accompanying music is perfect, as usual. If you are a Sarah Fan, buy this CD. You won't be disappointed.
B00002Z88D|5.0|For either the diehard Metallica fan or someone looking to introduce themselves to their music, this CD is a perfect choice. <br />First, the setlist is superb, containing a majority of their many hits and including 3 new songs: a kickass single (No Leaf Clover), a short symphonic opener (Ecstasy of Gold), and another solid rocker (-Human). With a few more hits (&quot;Fade to Black,&quot; &quot;Orion,&quot; and &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; come to mind) it would be a greatest hits album, althought that would undoubtedly put it onto three CDs. <br />Metallica's playing and the support of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra are what really make the album, though. 'Tallica rips through tracks like &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Fuel,&quot; and Hetfield roars at the crowd. The symphonic accompaniment is wonderful, though hard to describe. The orchestra beautifies each epic track (&quot;Call of Ktulu,&quot; &quot;The Outlaw Torn,&quot; and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; especially) without watering them down at all; they sound like they are playing notes that you knew were there but Metallica never played. It gives the complex sounds a rich quality without ever sounding, as Amazon reviewer Jerry McCulley put it above, like &quot;one long &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; outtake.&quot; You come away convinced that Metallica not only rocks hard but is composed of true musicians. <br />In short, this is the best album I could have hoped for from an awesome band. It will not disappoint.
0385335482|5.0|The funniest book I have read in years!  People on the airplane must have thought I was insane!!  If you liked Bridget Jones, then get ready for Becky, because she is about 5x's funnier.  The author did an Excellent job of surprising the reader, and the twists and turns were hysterical.  Several times I had to close the book for a minute, because I was cringing at what Becky had gotten herself into.  <br />A modern, single Lucille Ball - but instead of Ricky getting her out of the tricky situation, she goes shopping!  <br />Great Christmas present!!
B00005N83M|3.0|I only like 9 of these 16 songs. Jennifer Lopez has a poor, poor voice, and although she can dance, in the music business, talent is what makes the singer, and Jennifer is talented at dancing and acting, not at singing. Sorry, but this album is fair. It isn't even good. I gave it 3 stars because I like 9 songs. I'll be waiting for her next album and see if she's improved any.
B00000AOUD|5.0|I first remember listening to this in Japan, I was at U.S. Army Base, Camp Zama, on the way to pick up some wounded GIs for Thanksgiving dinner. A duce and a half truck had just spilled some frozen blood out onto the road in front of our car which we had to swerve to avoid. The war hit home then. The annoucer at Far East Network Radio (FEN) started playing this album. It brings home the era.
B00005Y228|5.0|This CD is awesome! I got it yesterday and the first time that I listened to it, I was truly hooked. Kylie has a beautiful voice and the songs are just phenomenal. What is Kylie waiting for to release her 2nd. album? There isn't one song on this CD that I don't like. I bought it and I loved it and if you buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00005YU1O|5.0|A great movie for people who think The Matrix is too simple or are just mesmerized by great animation.  Occasionally some of the dialogue went in one ear and out the other, but during those times the animation was particurally insane and I still had my eyes glued to the screen.<BR>Not only is the film smart and gorgeous, but it has some really clever creative moments right out of everyone's dreams.<BR>I saw Waking Life in September and I still think about things that were brought up.  This film is simply amazing in every aspect that a film can be amazing.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love this album. I bought it at a local store five days after it came out and I still listen to it as if it were brand new. Check out my review on each song.<br />1) Stripped Pt. 1 - 5/5 - Straight and in your face, to all haters. This is the way she is and she'll never change!!<BR>2) Can't Hold Us Down - 4/5 - Great female empowerment song. Makes us all girls feel great. <BR>3) Walk Away - 5/5 - Great sad ballad. First time that I listened to it I dropped tears.<BR>4) Fighter - 5/5 - I can identify with this song very easily. I trusted someone and he abused my trust. I will dedicate this song to him if I get my shot at singing someday.<BR>5) Primer Amor Interlude - 5/5 - Very sentimental. She's telling you a story. Excellent.<BR>6) Infatuation - 5/5 - Great song! Great Latin Beat, great lyrics. Can identify with it, too. I've been infatuated with a guy way too many times.<BR>7) Loving Embrace Interlude - 5/5 - Aww Christina's sooo sweet on this one. Wish it were another song instead of an interlude.<BR>8) Loving Me 4 Me - 5/5 - Isn't it great to be loved for who you are?<BR>9) Impossible - 5/5 - We've all gotten our heart broken some time in our lives, haven't we?<BR>10) Underappreciated - 5/5 - Fabulous message to all them guys out there that don't appreciate what they've got at home.<BR>11) Beautiful - 5/5 - Every time I feel down I listen to this song and it uplifts me.<BR>12) Move Over - 5/5 - Another feel great song. Brings the message that you shouldn't let anyone break you down.<br />13) Cruz - 5/5 - Great song, about starting a new life.<BR>14) Soar - 5/5 - Another spirit-uplifting song. Highly recommended to listen to when you feel sadly.<BR>15) Get Mine, Get Yours - 5/5 - Very racy. I love that!!<BR>16) Dirrty - 5/5 - Makes me want to get up and dance!!<BR>17) Stripped, Pt. 2 - Christina loves herself the way she is, and if you don't, that's too bad.<BR>18) The Voice Within - Another spirit-uplifting song with a fabulous message. Urges you to listen toyour heart when you don't know where to turn.<BR>19) I'm OK - 5/5 - Didn't know any of this about Christina. Made me cry, too.<BR>20) Keep On Singin' My Song - 5/5 - Yep! No matter what people say, keep on singin' your song, Christina! No one knows a thing!<br />Well, there you have it. My review. If you don't have this CD buy it! You won't be sorry. I guarantee it.
B000088E77|4.0|I'd just like to say that Business As Usual was one of the formative influences in my life when I was growing up. I loved Men at Work then and still do. This album never fails to conjure up the nostalgia for my early adolescence with great tunes, quirky lyrics, and Colin Hay's incredible vocals. Overall, it's a tremendous album, which deserves much respect.<br />Naturally, then, I was excited to see it remastered with bonus tracks from the band's &quot;Golden Era&quot;, and snatched up a copy right away. The new remastering is excellent and it is superior in sound quality in many ways to the original CD that has occupied my player for so long. The liner notes are helpful and give a nice retrospective for fans of the band, along with a lot of unique pix of the lads.<br />Which brings me to the extra stuff. The bonus cuts are a very cool and welcome addition. I loved Crazy and F-19 (an experimental ditty if there ever was one), but was frankly puzzled by the addition of the live tracks from the &quot;Brazil&quot; album. Why? I was hoping to get live performances from the &quot;Business as Usual&quot; era, but was instead confronted with two tracks that I already have on another disc! This was somewhat disappointing to me. Why not include live performances from 1981 or thereabouts instead of the reunion concert tracks? Another glaring omission is the b-side &quot;Anyone for Tennis?&quot; which should be on this disc but is sorely lacking.<br />All that aside, the two 1980s-era b-sides and the remastering make this a must-have for any MAW fan. Enjoy!
6304907648|4.0|Copycat - very well done thriller , with high empathis put on suspense and shock rather than merely gore an violence, keeps you in suspence and guessing till the end, in the same kind of legue as Silence of the Lambs, Seven ect. one of my favourite all time films as well as one of my favourite horror films - one of the few horror films i can watch numerous times.<BR>Definutly worth watching, makes you think as well - certainly not your average horror film.
0689835604|5.0|I bought this book for my son when he was only 4 months old.  He loved it then and it's still his favorite book a year later. Each page only has a few words - perfect for little one's who just want to turn the pages.  He loves looking under the flaps.  The flaps are starting to get a little worn, but when I ask my son if he wants me to read him a book this is the first one he grabs.  Only warning - when I first bought it for him he would have me read it 10+ times a sitting until I finally distracted him with another toy, he loved it that much.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What was Fox thinking dropping this awesome show, I loved the 3 non-aired shows. Joss did an exellent job and the actors just melded to one great cast.  If you like great stories, even westerns, you love this series. Trust me...
0689859368|5.0|I have never seen my son so into a book before.  He's 8 and he read the book in one night, barely stopping to eat!  I would suggest this series to any parent.  They are not as intimidating as other larger books and they obvioulsy capture the readers attention. He's finished book 2 and 3 with the same enthusiasm.  Now, I'm going to read them too!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched firefly whenever fox aired it and enjoyed the rich background and loved the characters.  The show wasn't respected by the network and so many never witnessed another great Joss Whedon show.  Now watching it on DVD I love it even more since I can view the episodes in there correct order (the original airings of each episode were for the most part out of order).  If you love Buffy or Angel I can guarantee you'll love this series.
B00006BTCA|5.0|When you hear the guitar intro in the first track (Untitled) you know that these guys are special, TOTBL has the makings of a classic album, great music, vocals and overall production, very moody, but it falls short of being a masterpiece, because of the lyrics. I know many alternative groups since the 80's use metaphors and great lyricists sometimes leave their songs to open interpretation, so you can make songs your own, but come on \\"subway is a porno, pavements are a mess\\" its lazy songwriting, this is an aspect they have to improve for their next album. On the other side of the music is amazing, all instruments perfectly executed. Many people compare them to Joy Division, and the mood they create recalls the sound of Manchester favorite sons, the difference is that the driving force of the music is not the bass player, but the drummer here stands out, he carries the weight of the rhythm section wich sounds a little more like The Smiths (Say Hello to the Angels). The double guitar playing is amazing too, they interplay very effectively creating walls of sound, unlike JD which only had Bernard Sumner and his use of feedback.<BR>**** 1/2, almost a classic debut.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't think I needed the DVD since I had the shows taped in Canada but HA was I wrong. The added bonus pieces, the interviews, commentary, all confirming what was so obvious on the show--that the actors got along splendidly and worked so well together. There's intrigue, romance, a character for everyone to love. There is no gleam in this spaceship, it's nothing like standard sci fi fare. It's more real and more believable. Makes you wish you could get on board for awhile. Buy it before they sell out, you won't be sorry.
B000002NHN|5.0|I love this album.  I find the music to be equivalent to a day spent in the art museums, absorbing all the colors, images and poetic visualizations.  It really focuses your energy and elevates your spiritual mood to listen to her music.  I prefer her over Enya.  She is incredibly passionate in her music.  I also recommend John Berberian on the Middle Eastern Oud, and Ottmar Liebert's flamenco guitar.  Get this CD, light candles and take a hot bath while playing it.  Her voice and music are very healing on many levels.  Your tension, stress or any grief will melt away when you listen to &quot;Mummer's Dance&quot;.  I also love The Mask and Mirror, another album of hers.  I've given both as gifts to friends and family along with a copy for myself!
0694003611|5.0|We read this book at least twice a night before my daughter goes to bed. It's just wonderful.
B000127LW2|3.0|$100.  You got to be kidding!<br />Boy, you trekkies love getting screwed.<br />Can't give more stars at that price.<br />Anyway, love the series. I always found it much easier to watch<BR>than TNG.  In fact, I've been watching TNG occasionally on Spike<BR>and I must say it falls in the same pitfall as Enterprise more<BR>often than I would have expected. <BR>Of couse I'm talking about the constant need for timetravel,<BR>parallel universes and alternate futures.  I really became <BR>annoyed with this in Enterprise.  Are they that desperate?  Then I realized, looking<BR>at TNG again that they do the same thing. Do you realize how<BR>screwed up the universe would be just from one ST series?<br />I really liked Voyager, but I would agree that there were <BR>too many encounters with the Borg. (And enterprise got so <BR>desperate they had to go there too) I never understood the<BR>whole Marquis thing. All these differences but they are <BR>starfleet officers? Mmmm...   But I never saw the first <BR>episodes for some reason, I don't think my station ever showed them.<BR> <BR>Also, the ending was terrible! Hey, Timetravel again! Surprise.<BR>But we all would have to agree on that.<BR>They would have been better off just leaving them<BR>in the delta quadrant and maybe continuing with <BR>movies. <br />Afterall how can you legitamately do movies<BR>about Voyager if they are home?
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I received my box set last week in the mail. None of the plastic inserts were loose and my copy of the director's cut of Alien was flawless. The interactive menus on all the discs are amazing, the most intricate and beautiful I have seen so far, and the hours and hours of extra features give wonderful insights into each of the films and those who made them. The picture quality is also something to behold. Very crisp and clear. Ok, so the rollout packaging is a tad awkward, but hey, it's really not that bad and for the low price of $69, I'm far from complaining too much.
0446608955|4.0|oK, I heard of Nicholas Sparksbefore but wasn't really motivated to go out and read any of his books. All of a sudden (in 2001) The movie for the resently published book was coming out. It looked like a great movie and I wanted to see it. Of course I wasn't going to see the movie without reading the book, so after I remembered themovie and book a few years later, I read and saw them, of course they were great.<BR>Sparks does warn you from the beginning that it's gonna be happy then sad, so you kind of know what's going to happen but that doesn't ruin the story. Because of Landon's comical nature and Jaimie's gooh-heartedness you really get into and feel the story. It's beautifully written and this was one time in the story I wished that something improbable and magical could happen. This was definitely one of the best books I have ever read, and OH, i have read quite a few. The only reason why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars was because of obvious plots in the story.READ THE BOOK!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It baffles me how Fox was able to cancel this show, it is, without question, one of the best Sci-Fi shows produced in recent memory.  If you like science fiction, or just good characterization, tight scripts, and great stories, then you definetely need to pick this up.  The only negative thing I can think of in relation to this DVD is that there aren't any more episodes coming our way.  The people at Fox are insane.
6304639457|4.0|This concert from the Mac is essential for two reasons:  1) you get to hear/see the songs left off from the Dance CD and 2) it was probably the last time Christine McVie toured with the band.  Even if you aren't a fan of Christine's songs, her voice beautifully fills in the 3-part harmonies that made Fleetwood Mac so famous.  And those 3-part harmonies were sorely missed on FM's latest album and tour (Say You Will), as good as that record and tour were.<br />The Dance concert is amazing from start to finish.  There's not a dud in the entire set, although naturally some songs are better than others. (Stevie's Sweet Girl, for instance, while pleasant enough, sounds like a cast-off from her solo albums, and it may very well have been just that.) A few comments:<br />--Great version of The Chain!  Lindsey, Stevie, and Chris at their harmonizing best.<BR>--Gold Dust Woman rocks.  Stevie really gets into this one and we get a chilling \\"scream.\\"  They should have bumped Dreams off the CD and included GDW.  Really.<BR>--One of the best versions of Gypsy I've ever heard.  Again, should have been on the CD.<BR>--Buckingham shines on his two acoustic efforts, Big Love and Go Insane.  You really get to see what that man can do with a guitar.  Wow.<BR>--Both Say You Love Me and Everywhere sound better than ever.  The banjo gives Say you Love Me some extra playfulness.  <BR>--Rhiannon, great as always, but I much prefer the \\"Dream on, silly dreamer\\" version. :(<BR>--Silver Springs - what can I say?  Chilling and intense.<BR>--Encore of Tusk, Don't Stop, and Songbird is a great all-around effort.<br />Finally, a comment on some of the reviewers' observations that Christine McVie looks bored.  Yes, she's more subdued than Nicks, Buckingham, and Fleetwood.  But in a band of the eccentric and insane Buckingham and the twirling rock goddess Nicks, someone has to play it cool.
0385335482|4.0|what a hilarious book! i thought becky and i are twins!!<BR>i could find myself in this book. if you've ever thought that you're a shopoholic, this book is a must for you.<BR>probably you could stop buying stuff...
B00005JM0B|4.0|The 1980s gave us \\"The Terminator;\\" the 1990s gave us \\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day,\\" and now we have \\"T3: Rise of the Machines.\\"  All things considered, I had every right to expect this movie to be a bust.  Not only did James Cameron (who directed the first two \\"Terminator\\" movies) bow out, but his ex-wife and star Linda Hamilton also said \\"hasta la vista, baby\\" to \\"T3.\\"  Linda Hamilton's role as Sarah Connor was a crucial element to the first two \\"Terminator\\" films, and without her, my faith headed south.  But thanks to director Jonathan Mostow, he makes \\"Terminator 3\\" a worthy sequel that doesn't come across as a desperate attempt to give Arnold Schwarzenegger a hit.  Like \\"T2,\\" Arnold plays a \\"good\\" terminator on a mission to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) against the relentlessly evil terminatrix TX (a wonderfully icy Kristianna Loken).  \\"T3\\" lacks the groundbreaking punch of its last two films, and Stahl comes off as a bit bland as John Connor, but the film overall succeeds as an above-average action flick.  Special effects-wise, there's nothing to write home about, but there are a few scenes that will have you hooked to the screen, including an extended car chase that's downright ugly.  It's also not afraid to make fun of itself by recycling one-liners like \\"she'll be back,\\" \\"I'll be back,\\" and \\"talk to the hand.\\"  I can't say that \\"T3\\" will go down as one of the great action movies and I'm also not sure I would want to see a \\"T4,\\" but it definitely exceeded my expectations.
B00005JMGL|5.0|This movie was beautiful and stunning.  Yes, he added an extra character and a bit of cheesiness with the puppy love factor.  Apart from that, I was aboslutely touched.  This is the most beautiful movie I have seen in years.  And such a perfect kids movie.  It really deserves all 5 stars.  If you're wondering, I saw it at a preview screening last night.  As we were leaving, I saw a big, gruff looking dad wiping tears from his eyes.  This movie is really something special.  Go see it, go buy it when it comes out on dvd, and show it to your children.  And they'll probably show it to thiers, as it manages to be absolutely timeless.
B0000DD7LC|3.0|When I played this cd for the first time I was not immediately blown away.  Diary is a better improvement from Songs in a minor which also did not blow me away.  The cuts I like on diary are &quot;you don't know my name, &quot;If I ain't got you&quot;,&quot;diary&quot;,&quot;dragon days&quot;, and &quot;wake up&quot;.  &quot;Heartburn&quot; is the weakest track which does not fully showcase Alicia's abilities as a singer and songwriter. I think Alicia Keys has good potential as an artist, but her studio work still leaves much to be desired IMO.  I like her better live. I would like to see her work with a more accomplished producer on her next cd. I give diary three stars because it is much better than Songs in a minor. Alicia is still vastly overrated and still needs time to grow as an artist. I would recommed buying &quot;Comfort Woman&quot; by Meshell Ndegeocello who is very underrated.
B00003CY0V|3.0|Swordfish:  Many people think of this movie as the movie that they had to pay the most beautiful actress alive to go topless.  She did and many men flocked to see it just for that reason...I was one of them.:)  That made critics believe there wasn't much to the movie if they had to go to that extent to draw attention to it.  The truth is...well, it wasn't that great a movie and had that little stunt never happened chances are I would not own the DVD now.  The overall movie is okay.  John Travolta's character is sinister and cold hearted.  Halle Berry never looked better...she gets 5 stars.:)  Hugh Jackman's role was nothing special.  The movie was a pretty hefty letdown...it had a chance to be really good at times but just didn't click.  There were some nice action scenes but nothing I haven't seen before...the hacking scenes were not believable and there was a lot of corniness to the film...including the ending.  There was a cool scene in which a bus flies over the city...but overall this movie is nothing special.  Special features include 2 alternate endings.  It looks like they did choose the best of the 3 endings though.
B00005V1B2|5.0|Welcome to Camel's third album, Snow Goose, a nice concept album based on---the same novel about how a woman who finds a wounded bird and takes it to Rhayader.   The bird and he become friends, and the woman falls in love with the old hunchback.  The climax of the book and the album is Rhayader's courageous (and tragic) act of courage at Dunkirk, as he rescues countless lives while the snow goose shows him the way amidst gunfire.  Although I've never read the book, now that I have grasped the plot, Camel's album is all the more poignant.  The Snow Goose is a true progressive album, as it embraces so many moods and musical styles, and still manages to retain a central theme.  As a whole, the music is much wispier than Mirage or their debut.  The one-two punch of Rhayader/Rhayader Goes To Town is the undisputed highlight.  This is a song for every taste, be it balls-out guitar soloing or light bouncy flute-driven sequences.  Another great song is Migration, a nice jazzy piece that has one of the only vocal parts (actually, it's more like laid back scatting) on the album.  Flight of the Snow Goose, has some interesting guitar-play from Latimer, but it is never forefront; this is more a drum-keyboard song.  Preparation/Dunkirk are also noteworthy just for the sheer moods they evoke.  Bardens's keyboard and is very effective in creating an ominous tension in Preparation before the all-out bash of Dunkirk.  La Princesse Perdue is an extended reworking of the theme of The Flight, with some majestic horns added Latimer's solo is a nice sort of farewell to the listener.  The bonus tracks mostly show early stages of the Snow Goose, especially the Rhayader songs.  The highlight is the live version of the Snow Goose song, and it's segue into Freefall.  The liner notes describe how Camel had originally, before they settled on Snow Goose, wanted to do a concept album on Hesse's Siddhartha; they had actually recorded a song called Riverman for the album, but it never saw the lightof day.  That would have been a worthy addition for this CD.  This, of course, is minor niggling over a masterpiece.
0375703861|2.0|This book focuses on too many characters with too little development of any of them.  I completed it without caring what happened to the multitude of people I'd been introduced to.  It had religious, cultural and racial tones that were too diffuse to prove anything.  It included two May/December convenience marriages; Muslim extremist vs. agnostic/buddist vs. born-again Christian extremists; stereotypical rejection of all that is East or West--destiny vs. scientific intervention; and racial undertones that were off base at best.  An implausible and meddling &quot;perfect&quot; family attempts to come in half way through the book and fix the poor mixed up lower classes who are too ignorant to take care of themselves.  To some, this apparently makes for a 4 1/2 star story.  If you still feel a need to read it, check it out at the library and make sure you don't have overdue fines--it isn't worth it.
0783227434|5.0|For those who worship cult movies, this is great. But if you love bad special effects and clich one-liners, you will love this too. You can look at this movie two ways, either a cool horror movie or a bad-budget movie with random one-liners from Bruce Campbell. I looked at it the latter, and I fell off the bed laughing so hard! It's so bad, it's hilarious!
B0000DZ3IG|3.0|While I have yet to see the movie, I know that it and the soundtrack have something in common, critics across the nation have been raving about how great they are. Considering that my job &amp; new born child don't offer me as much spare time as I used to have, I opted to scoop up a copy of the soundtrack until my schedule becomes free and I can see the movie. I found myself repeatedly surprised here; the eclectic mix of songs is great &amp; this is definetly one of the most slept on records of the year.<br />Kelly Clarkson starts things off on the wrong foot with one of Thankful's weaker numbers, &quot;The Trouble with Love Is&quot;, but yet some old school Dido ('Here with Me') quickly redeems the early mistake &amp; reaffirmed my faith in what was soon to follow. Maroon 5's &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot; is very pleasing to the ear, especially since I was expecting something on the harder side, an expectation set by &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; their catchy breakthrough single. Other noteable tracks are Eva Cassidy's &quot;Songbird&quot; &amp; Norah Jones &quot;Turn Me On&quot;.<br />Following the inclusion of &quot;Songbird&quot;, the album stumbles along till the closing, with The Calling's &quot;Wherever you will Go&quot;, Joni Mitchell &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; &amp; Lynden David Hall &quot;All You Need is Love&quot;, all of which you need to be in the mood to appreciate. Closing with the christmas songs from the movie was a wise move, that way during the off season you can listen to the whole soundtrack till the last 3 tracks and then shut it off, that is if your not in the mood for some holiday cheer.<br />I recommend this album because it's a pretty solid soundtrack, one of the best I've heard in a really long time actually. It has enough good moments to make the speed bumps appear smaller, and it's really a feel good record. Check this one out.
078681859X|4.0|This story is a lot like The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches by Robert Stanek. A classic good vs. evil story. There's a young wizard apprentice, Nathaniel, with a rough childhood who gets pushed to far. Think Vilmos from Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches. A strange and powerful being. In this case a Djinn called Bartimaeus in Kingdoms and the Elves it is Xith. Overall recommended but read the real thing first.
B00004TL21|5.0|This CD is the first one i bought by the deftones, and i must say, it was really a good place to start. This is the band's best CD showing excellent maturity in song structure and mood. The lyrics are still cryptic and poetic just like their previous works, but the sound itself this time is a different journey.<br />1: Feiticeira- The opening track is an alternative hard rock blast with a light groove for vocals. The lyrics are strange and fascinating. &quot;and just before i come to- move to the back of the car- she made me touch the machine- new murderer&quot;<br />2: Digital bath- This is not only my favorite song by the deftones, but it's one of my favorite songs of all time. when i first heard it, i was amazed that anyone could think of a melody so simple yet so intraquit to sing with so much emotion. It's the an amazing melodic song full of sorry and loss. Chino himself said that this song was based on a dream he had in which there was a girl in a bathtub, and he dropped a toaster into it, thus giving her some kind of pleasure. &quot;I know you can see the cord break away- cuz tonight i feel like more&quot;<br />3: Elite- very heavy yet catchy song. the whole entire song is scratchy shreaking on Chino's part as he lashes out at an unknown person or group of people. <br />4: rx queen- probably my least favorite song on the CD. It's a weird love song, more of less. That in itself isn't the problem. The only reason i don't really like it is because it just sounds too simple and the chorus isn't that good when you compare it to the epic &quot;digital bath&quot;.<br />5: street carp- one of my favorites on the CD despite how short it is. It's short and sweet, and it gets to the point quickly as Chino sings beautifully but with frustration at a girl he can't get away from in a relationship.<br />6: teenager- this is another simple soft song with straight-to-the-point lyrics. sounds like it's talking about a lover moving away. sounds like Smashing Pumkins only a lotbetter with Chino's vocals.<br />7: Knife prty- Another favorite of mine, this song is another beautifully sung song with an excellent emotionally confusing intro. The lyrics are eerie, but the vocals sweet and innocent. the instrumentals sound sad. The song is about exactly what the title says- a knife party.<br />8: Korea- Not my favorite as far as lyrics or vocals. The song has good and crunchy instrumentals and is probably the only other actual heavy song on the CD besides &quot;Elite&quot;. But when he screams during the chorus, he doesn't sound angry, just possessed and agonized. It's an ok stand alone song, i guess.<br />9: passanger- An excellent track featuring Maynard Keenan from Tool and A Perfect Circle. The instrumentals sound like a Tool song to match Keenan's vocals. The Chorus is excellent. It goes from Chino singing a part that sounds similar to the Chorus of &quot;Digital Bath&quot; then goes into Maynard singing a toolesque chorus. Chino said the song's lyrics were a prequal to &quot;Be Quiet and Drive&quot; off Around The Fur. Probably my favorite track aside from &quot;Digital Bath&quot;.<br />10: Change (in the house of flies)- couldn't have put out a better track on the CD for the first single. It's melodic yet heavily layered with guitars and just sinks itself in.<br />11: Pink Maggit: Great closing track. It has a great intro where Chino sings softly. Sounds like he's singing innocently about killing someone, then it goes into a triumphant opus of a finale singing with well...courage i guess is what it sounds like. Chino said that this song was supposed to be a little bit silly to the band. Said it was about wishing you were popular in High SChool, sort of tongue-in-cheek making fun of other bands that only hint at that and are completely serious about it.<BR>&quot;Cause back in school, we are the leaders of it all, so transpose.&quot;<br />An excellent album to stand alone by itself. They're metaphorical lyrics are pushed to their fullest on this album and there is not one corny moment like there is in so much new rock these days.
B000069HK2|5.0|hey I have to say  that this is a great CD. And to that guy who posted that you wont like this cd if you like the whitestripes, radiohead, or the smashing pumpkins...you are wrong my friend I love all those bands and just because it's not the same type of music it is still great but just in a different way...closedminded punk.
B000003BD3|3.0|This would appear to have been the Rolling Stones's answer to the Beatles's &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;. (The Beatles: &quot;Yesterday&quot;; the Rolling Stones: &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;. The Beatles: sitar in &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;; the Rolling Stones: sitar in &quot;Paint it Black&quot;. The Beatles: Sgt. Pepper; the Rolling Stones: Satanic Majesties. Etc.) It isn't clear from the liner notes whether Mick Jagger suppressed it (originally) or the BBC refused it. (It's just too band the BBC didn't refuse &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;.)<br />The best thing about this is the Dirty Mac version of &quot;Yer Blues&quot; (it isn't a &quot;cover&quot;, by the way, boys and girls; cease abusing this term.), which I think is much better that the White album version. I wonder if the title of this ad hoc ensemble, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience's drummer, Cream's guitarist, and the  Rolling Stones's Keith Richards on bass, isn't a poke at John Lennon's then band-mate. <br />I'd prefer Yoko didn't perform on &quot;Whole Lotta Yoko&quot;, or anywhere else, but her performance here isn't nearly as bad as some are telling themselves. If it were some kind of musical instrument, rather than a voice, making precisely the same sound on precisely the same pitches I doubt anyone would object. The rock-and-roll violin on this cut, by the way, may be a first. I wish the violin weren't so buried in the mix.<br />The Who bit is amusing but hardly spectacular.<br />The Rolling Stones set sounds pretty typical. I prefered the &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; version here over the single version because the bongo drums and Nicky Hopkins's piano come through more clearly here.<br />Marianne Faithful can't really sing, it would seem. Her song is really a chant. Her accompaniment sounds canned.<br />It's wild to find Jethro Tull on the same disc with the Rolling Stones, etc. Ian Anderson's vocal is very close to that on the &quot;This Was&quot; version, but not quite the same. He seems to switch from harmonica to flute and back with remarkable rapidity, and I'm dubious about this performance's veracity.<br />Taj is nothing much here--just okay.
B000007T2Z|4.0|I'm going to take a different tract from most of these reviews.<br />I'm goning to assume that you, like me...saw 28 Days Later and went home wondering who the heck did that one song when the city was empty.  Congradulations for finding the band and the album...East Hastings is the song you're looking for, though I doubt it's anything like what you expect.  <br />You heard that great goove from &quot;East Hastings&quot; and searched to find it and want to buy the album but are reading these reviews cause you wonder if maybe, the rest of the album is crap.<br />If all you like is that neutron bomb aftermath grove from the movie, you sure don't want this album.  I actually thought that was what i wanted, but...it's definatly not what i got...and i'm not really dissapointed.<br />What you get, instead of the expected, is an album that is an entire movie in and of itself.  This is headphone music for sure, this is put on the headphones explore the sounds being created.  Let them kiss you, fondle you, explore your body...and just enjoy the fact that someone bothered to spend all this time making music that isn't gonna score a hit single.<br />Be patient, have an imagination, an you'll get quite a trip...one you'll be glad you spent an hour in a chair devoting some headphone time too.<br />Basically, this review is for anyone that came to the band and album from 28 Days Later.  It's not what you hoped to find, but I think you'll like it nonetheless.<br />And well, sheesh, at the very least...if you have or want to have alot of black and glass things in your house/apartment...it'll make some nice background music while you lay out the table for your guests.
B00005JKC3|3.0|Ang Lee is a great director...let there be no doubt.  CROUCHING TIGER, ICE STORM, SENSE &amp; SENSIBILITY.  All TRULY outstanding films. So it comes as no surprise that he would try to bring greatness to a genre little familiar with greatness...the movie comic / superhero genre.<br />On many levels, Ang Lee did a great thing.  He attempted to REALLY delve into the emotional angst of his characters...to show use in a &quot;believable&quot; manner how Hulk could have come into being.  The opening credits for the movie are great, in my opinion, truly setting a mood while giving us a lot of backstory.  The cinematography and unusual style of fade-in / fade-out that Lee uses throughout are highly suggestive of a comic come to life.  It is a daring movie on many levels and really kept me engaged in the conflicts building up.  I was able to enjoy not just the &quot;superhero level&quot; quandries of the characters, but their human problems as well.<br />However, the movie fails Lee (and vice-versa) in two fatal ways.<br />1)  Lee is obviously a good director of experienced performers.  Think of Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh in CROUCHING TIGER...probably their best work.  Signourney Weaver in ICE STORM.  Great.  Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet in SENSE...Oscar nominees.  Lee must establish a wonderful rapport with his experience actors.  In HULK, Nick Nolte is a bit over-the-top but actually quite frightening, and Sam Elliott is at his best.  Jennifer Connolly gives a tortured performance.  But newcomer Eric Bana is just NOT GOOD.  He may look OK for the part, but he brings no emotional heft, no believeability to his role...and that's a REAL problem.  If we don't buy Bruce Banner in all his anguish, we have a hard time making an emotional connection with him.  (To a lesser degree, the inexperienced Josh Lucas is also miscast and unconvincing.)<br />2)  THE SPECIAL EFFECTS STINK!  When I think of the miracle of craft that Gollum is in LORD OF THE RINGS, it is inconceivable to me that the Hulk was allowed to come to an audience looking so totally and completely unconvincing.  There are a few nice moments, such as when a sprinkler system is raining water everywhere, and we see it running off of Hulk.  But I was AWARE of the thought that went into that shot...I was totally removed from the movie.  The worst is when Hulk is prancing around in the desert...oh my God.  '50s era monster movies weren't much worse!!  It is simply impossible to suspend your disbelief as the film nears its climax, and thus the whole contraption falls apart.<br />Ang Lee will no doubt continue to make outstanding films.  He (and we) should just chalk this one up to experience and move on.  If you haven't seen this movie, I can't really think of a compelling reason.  There are more clearly awful movies out there, true, but there is something sad about watching a movie that COULD have been really special fall so short.
1400034779|4.0|Reading the blurb with biographical details about author Alexander McCall Smith, it is obvious that he is an extraordinary man. Still, it is a feat that an upper educated Englishman can so clearly inhabit the persona of a poorly educated black woman in Botswana.<br />Readers who are unfamiliar with that country will come away with a much more thorough understanding of place after reading THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY.  Smith's heroine is a middle-aged black woman who cleverly solves the mysteries that visit her town. She uses common sense and shrewd observation to put two and two together and come up with four when others are not even counting. As such, the individual vignettes are deeply satisfying.<br />There is a poignancy to Smith's descriptions, however, of how difficult life is in that corner of Africa, of how its people are so accustomed to their hard lives, and how they take pleasure in such small things.<br />Other issues, more terrible issues, are alluded to in the book. Yet some of these secrets are not completely explored, secrets about slavery and voodoo and human sacrifice. Certainly, discourse on these problems would have ruined the pacing of the separate stories, but it was troubling to see them hinted at nonetheless.<br />Alexander McCall Smith is an author of immense talent.
B0000028RR|4.0|This album may not have been the start of rap-metal, or nu-metal, but it no doubt influenced those genres heavily. It's got to be one of the best, and most aggressive debuts of the last 20 years. I also think that they're one of the few bands who's name reflects the music perfectly. This starts off with the 1-2 punch of &quot;Bombtrack&quot; and &quot;Killing In The Name Of&quot;, and every track after is almost as awesome. &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; is amazing as well, and guest stars Maynard from &quot;Tool&quot;. The muscle of metal, the groove of funk, and the politics of punk, have forever made this disc a raging success. Their other albums are good too, but this is the only one that's essential.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Super sweet tv show. Too bad those idiots at Fox tv canceled it.  The DVD's are excellent quality and you dont have to watch commercials that support Fox.  Buy it and have a great time watching.
B000000WF0|5.0|As good as &quot;A Storm In Heaven&quot; and &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; were, this is their peak, and I can't imagine it possibly being any better. It's a career album full of the most amazing and beautiful songs. It begins of course with the dramatic &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot;, probably THE song of 1997. But it also includes the singles &quot;The Drugs Don't Work&quot; and &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, and two gorgeous ballads &quot;Sonnet&quot; and &quot;One Day&quot;. There's a few of their trademark space-jams on here as well. They apparently decided to go out on top, since the band split after this, and &quot;Richard Ashcroft&quot; has already got a couple solo albums under his belt. So unless they release a &quot;Best Of&quot;, this is it.
B00000099Y|5.0|There is only one way to describe an album such as this one, and it is perfect. To put Tool in a genre that includes lesser bands is sacreligious. They are all together something totally different and unseen before.
B00006M183|4.0|&quot;Pearl Jam&quot; have yet to make a perfect album, but I find them all great in their own ways, and &quot;Riot Act&quot; is another great one. &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, and this album, have found that place where grunge and classic rock equally meet, and it's a good thing. This has numerous quality songs, &quot;Save You&quot;, &quot;Green Disease&quot;, and the single &quot;I Am Mine&quot; among them. But I think the highlight for me is &quot;You Are&quot;. It's different, but still one of my all-time favorites of theirs. &quot;Matt Cameron&quot; was a great addition to this band as well. &quot;Riot Act&quot; will mostly please fans of &quot;No Code&quot; and &quot;Yield&quot;, but any fan of &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, or good music should like it.
B000002NFM|5.0|Never before have I heard such an intricate and aggresive album. Its brutal synthetic sound, its lyricists, its overall fierceness- the entire work shines with electric and brilliant craftsmanship. &quot;Smack My B---- Up&quot; is by far the most amazing and unique track on &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot;. The noise of edgy and low-pitched sounds, combined with screaming interjections at perfectly selected points within the song, make it highly original and chillingly raw. Amazing stuff.
B00000DGUY|4.0|This may be missing a few tracks, but for the casual fan, it should be just what you want. I got this recently and ended up knowing about twice what I thought I would, and what I didn't know I now like as well. It's top-notch 80's/classic rock, with great guitar and lyrics. Included are the huge hits \\"Walk Of Life\\", \\"Sultans Of Swing\\", \\"So Far Away\\", and \\"Your Latest Trick\\" live. Other good ones are \\"Romeo And Juliet\\", \\"Calling Elvis\\", and \\"On Every Street\\". My only complaints are that \\"Money For Nothing\\" dropped an entire verse (yeah, that one), and that \\"Twisting By The Pool\\" sucks. But otherwise, this is what you want if you're looking for your first, or only Dire Straits cd.
0385504209|3.0|I would recommend this book for plot, historical fact combined with a contemporary story, and puzzles contained within.  The problem I have is with the liberties Mr. Brown takes on several serious religious theories.  Jesus having a child, etc.  There are books that approach this story utilizing more traditional religious theory on the Holy Blood, the Royal Bloodline in France, and the quest for the Holy Grail.  Try a book titled THE GOAT WITHOUT HORNS.
B000002INR|4.0|I'm not sure why, but I always liked &quot;Skid Row&quot; a little more than the rest of the bunch. Maybe it's because they spent more time on rocking, and less time on makeup. This is an excellent debut, and one of the few rock albums that I can play straight through. All these songs are good, but the better ones are the anthem &quot;Youth Gone Wild&quot;, the awesome &quot;18 And Life&quot;, and one of the best ballads from the era &quot;I Remember You&quot;. Overall, I think this one is up there with &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot;, and kind of a cross between the two.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Actually they can - and they did. For reasons uncomprehensible to me, Fox canceled this intelligently written, funny, serious, character-driven, and totally unique show - presumably to air yet another \\"encore presentation\\" of \\"When Joe Millionaires Attack the Simple Life\\".  Grr.    This is arguably one of the most clever and interesting shows ever done and it makes me so mad that it was canceled.  The DVD has only made the cancellation that much more frustrating.    The pilot (when viewed first) is very well done and is a good introduction to the characters and with just enough backstory to keep the plot moving forward.      The unaired episodes are some of the best and it's a mystery why they weren't aired.  And the previously aired episodes - well, they lived up to my memory of them.  They were even better the second time around. (And the 3rd and 4th!)    I highly, highly recommend this DVD set whether you are a fan of Joss Whedon's other shows (Buffy/Angel) or not.  And if you don't like westerns or if you don't like shows with space ships, try it anyway. It combines the genres in a totally unique and cool way.    Let's hope the DVD sales are good enough so we get a movie - and movie tickets sales good enough to bring the series back!! And if they aren't...well, I'll be in my bunk.
B000068PQ0|4.0|There has been hype about this album for awhile now, and for the most part I think it's justified. Comparisons to \\"Radiohead\\", \\"Wilco\\", and \\"Beck\\" are understandable. It's mostly just pleasing alt-rock, with just enough blips and beeps to make you feel like you're floating through space. The singers voice helps achieve that illusion as well. To simplify, it makes you happy. Not every track is a winner, but as a whole, it's pretty amazing. The better tracks here are \\"Flight Test\\", \\"Ego Tripping At The Gates Of Hell\\", and \\"Do You Realize?\\", which was recently used in a commercial for VH-1, and includes the thought-provoking line \\"Do You Realize that everyone you know, someday will die\\". Maybe it's not so happy.
0156027321|5.0|When 16 year old Piscine finds himself in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific, with a zebra, orangatan, hyena, and a Bengal tiger, he has to use his wits to survive.  When his ordeal finally ends, 277 days later, he has to use his wits to return to society.  'The Life of Pi' is a compelling, complex, theological, thoroughly enjoyable book that will leave the reader sifting through it's many levels for a long time after finishing it.  I think the interpretations of what this book really meant will be as varied as the readers.  This book certainly outperformed all it's expectations for me.  5 Stars!
630280082X|5.0|I absoulutely love this movie!  The music is great and Stevie Vai is incredible(as usual)! Ralph Macchio does a wonderful job. I have this on vhs, cd, and NEED THIS ON DVD!!!!!
1577312082|5.0|Let me first say I have the audio tapes to both, this and Practicing the Power of NOW.  I have read the comments by those who do not seem to grasp or understand the practical use of this book, or how to achieve the results it promises.  Many feel the book makes tall claims and repeats them ad infinitum without much in the way of practical, down to Earth utility.  The last reviewer even commented that one of the premises of the book, that time is a delusion of the mind, is flawed at its core.  Do not be misled, swayed or otherwise put off by these comments as they stem from a lack of understanding.  How do I know?  Because these concepts have revolutionized my state of being.  The truths in this book stand on their own, independent of those who deny their relevance or existence.<br />As a matter of background, I have read and listened to myriad self-help books, from Anthony Robbins and Stephen Covey to Shannon Duncan and the like.  I spent fifteen years of my life searching for the secret to happiness and joy.  Although many of the books and tapes I've read and listened to provided great benefit to my state of mind, none has penetrated my state of being so deeply as this.  This is what I had been searching for.<br />Some will read (or listen) to this book and feel it is potentially nothing more than mystical mumbo jumbo without much practical merit, or puzzle over how to actually get from where they are to where Tolle claims they can be.  Some may feel he states the same affirmations over and over, just in different ways, hence rendering the book relatively useless or feeling it to be an exercise in redundancy.  Let me address these individuals by saying the problem does not lie in the book/audio but in your own perception.<br />Firstly, Tolle does, in fact, repeat many of the same concepts and personal perceptions at length, in a variety of ways.  For, what he is doing is describing what success in using the concepts feels like from myriad angles.  Far from being unnecessarily repetitive, it is essential for those who require a criteria for determining if they are applying the concepts correctly.  They say a picture is worth a thousand words.  While listening, somewhere along the way, many people will &quot;get it&quot; simply because Tolle repeated a concept from an angle the person finally understood.  Again, this repetition isn't for those who already understand, but rather those who are still trying to find the right angle of understanding.<br />Some may deny the concepts within, such as time is a delusion of the mind, but reality doesn't always conform to our expectations.  It is this denial that keeps these individuals chained to their discomfort, and it is certainly their choice to make.  For those who've actually experienced what Tolle is describing, he couldn't be more accurate in his statements; experience is the ultimate determinant.<br />In a nutshell, to experience what Tolle is describing one must focus on things around them at the present moment and keep their focus there.  Observe and don't judge what you're observing.  The act of becoming intensely aware of that which is around you right where you are (without judgement) is the key, as doing this slowly and eventually draws focus away from the ongoing background noise of the mind; the incessant chattering.  How do you know if you're actually making progress?  Focus internally on your body and emotions and see how you feel.  If you feel calm, joy and happiness, then you're on the right path.  If not, then the contrary.<br />In short, this program will transform your life if understood and used as Tolle intended.  Otherwise, one may relegate it as useless and repetitive.  Let me say this program receives my highest recommendation for those in emotional pain.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw this show when it was in previews in San Francisco on a whim. I fell in love with this show almost immediately, definately by the time Galinda made her descent in her bubble mobile. The voices of Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are incredible, especially on &quot;Popular&quot; and the show-stopping &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;.  Bought the CD as soon as it hit the shelves.  Love it.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Having read a fair amount of negative reviews of &quot;Train Of Thought&quot;, I figured they were probably pretty much on the money... That is, until I actually heard the cd. I have been extremely disappointed with DT's output for the past few releases (including live albums)... I feel that &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; was the last good cd they put out, but I'm happy to say that their losing streak has been broken by this newest release!<br />It seems that they got rid of a lot of the excess that was dragging them down and were able to channel their energies into a solid piece of Prog-Metal genius. Not a bad track to be found, it all works together, from the first note to the monochromatic cd layout.<br />Plus, I had read that some people felt Jordan Rudess' keyboards had been mixed too low, to be almost M.I.A. This is clearly not true, as they are loud and clear... Maybe they don't come off as intrusive as some would like, but his playing clearly supports these songs instead of working against them... Look at the song credits- Jordan's name is on everyone of them! How could he possibly be missing?<br />All in all, a very welcome comeback (in my opinion) and a great addition to your collection!
B000002J03|5.0|As though Led Zeppelin I weren't good enough to keep fans satisfied, the band quickly followed it up with this equally amazing album. It contains some of the most creative and memorable riffs and moments in Led Zeppelin's catalogue, not to mention all of rock music.<BR>Its weaknesses? Moby Dick on the album sounds good at first but once you've heard a live version it seems lame by comparison. Still good, though. Also, Bring It On Home seems to end almost as soon as it begins, unfortunately.<BR>Whole Lotta Love kicks off with a simple but catchy riff that gets you rocking, through the psychedelic middle section (produced by random knob-twisting on the amps while Page and Jones played) and back into the impressive solo. <BR>What Is And What Should Never Be is a nice soft song to help you recover from WLL, containing a nice speaker-shift and one of Jones' best bass lines.<BR>Lemon Song--a very awesome blues, with the bass part completely improvised on the spot, and still probably the best one I've heard by Jones.<BR>Thank You is a pretty, if a bit sappy-sounding, ode to Robert Plant's wife, and also a nice contrast to the rest of the upbeat album.<BR>Heartbreaker, featuring a memorable riff and the most awe-inspiring solo you'll ever hear, is an instant classic. It can't be listened to too many times.<BR>Living Loving Maid, while not a particularly great song by comparison to the rest, has a great riff and some intriguing lyrics (if you can understand them)<BR>Ramble On is a nice acoustic rocker with godly bass playing and lyrical references to Tolkien that would later fill the Untitled album. Turn up that bass boost to enjoy this song even more.<BR>Moby Dick--a cool riff, but of course the point of the song is the drums. COmpared to how Bonham played this live the studio version sounds kind of anticlimactic and almost boring sometimes, but it's still worth its 4 minutes.<BR>And Bring It On Home, in case you'd forgotten Led Zeppelin was a blues band too, has an admirable head-banging riff, cool bass and harmonica parts, and is of course a cover of a classic blues song--what would a Zeppelin album be without that?
B00004BZ0N|5.0|London Calling got my attention. For 1979, when it was recorded, the tracks on this double vynil album now CD are distinctively the Clash; both the punk side and their commercial leanings. Sandinista! is my personal ABSOLUTE fav but this record is the runner up. I admit that I have not hear the remaster, I just know the music. Much different than that 1984 hit they had (Casbar (sp?)) in the US. Fantastic spin!
B00004SCX6|4.0|This album is terrific. In this album, there are 3 WONDEFUL songs, and they are :<BR>Oops I did it again - 5/5<BR>Stronger - 5/5<BR>Don't let me be the last to know - 5/5 <BR>Hey ! I like this album not because she can dance well, or because she is just popular! I buy her albums because I like her music! Take my advice, and buy this only for the music. And I really recommend to buy this album.
B00003CXRM|1.0|Talk about low-brow humor!  There were a couple of funny moments and other than that this movie was painfully slow moving and boring even with George Clooney starring!
B0000AQS6R|3.0|Lower key and perhaps more endearing than its predecessors, this third installment of the Vacation saga finds the Clark W. Griswolds hosting their family for some Christmas fun.  Chevy returns as usual as the hapless every-dad family man overseeing his latest `mission' to provide a Christmas that he has never had.  The Audrey and Russ turn-over rate continues, this time with Juliette Lewis and the kid from Rosanne.  Beverly D'Angelo's Ellen returns, displaying her new face lift, can't even smile fully now, which is a pity.  The sight gags remain, but despite the presence of cousin-in-law Randy Quaid, this movie strives for and to some extent succeeds in giving us a more personal, intimate glimpse of Clark and the family dynamics.  I wouldn't consider this a classic, and it doesn't take the crown from the first film, but it does improve on the second's dreadful outing.
B00000IQV6|4.0|I think this movie was hilarious. Robin Williams, though a little old, made a very convincing Patch Adams. The story was solid and made sense throught the whole movie. One of the downsides of this movie is that at times it gets a little sappy- AND obscene. I would have preferred if they had cleaned up the language a little- and- well, the scene where Robing(AS PAtch) decorates the hospital entrance as a woman's widespread legs, WELL!<BR>If it were cleaned up, I would give it 10 stars out of five.<br />(Do the math. it works.)
6305513406|5.0|I have aleways loved both of these episodes. Gary Lockwood becomes so powerfull in his esp abilities he dares think of himself as a GOD. Of course Kirk has to take him out but its his best friend. Good writing. The other episode shows kirks wits as he &quot;bluffs&quot; an alien into thinking the Enterprize is far more powerfull than it is. By the way, only two episodes per disc is a shame why cant Paramount afford 6 shows a disc the dirty sons of...
0151008116|5.0|Yann Martel's &quot;Life of Pi&quot; is quirky and appealing.  This is a great book club read.<br />Fern Reiss, author, &quot;The Publishing Game: Bestseller in 30 Days&quot;
6305232660|5.0|This movie really suprized me at its release. It came out with Armagedden and was lesser known.The good news is its much better. It does not have as many special effects but it balances that with story telling. The main charcters get you involved with thier lives as the Earth faces oblivion. plenty of touching scenes and good acting all around. It proves that man may survive no matter what. Was thier survial plan practical? I dont know but, I doubt you have a dry eye at the end of this movie.<br />highly recommendned.
6302293553|4.0|No one can appreciate such a film, such a grotesque and even clownish film, if they do not understand British humour. Everything is systematically put upside down. You will not laugh your head off, and yet everything is funny, but mostly funny strange or funny just plain silly rather than funny AhAh. Every scene is an allusion to an element that comes from English culture or from standard films on or around Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and it is made silly in a way or another. The creativity of Monty Python is immense and probably bottomless, that's why you can't spank him really. It is never gross and yet it is not far from it. And the funniest part is of course the deep anti-French humour that nearly opens and closes the film. Only the French can pour s**t on the head of a crowned English king. But they do. Monty Python also likes anachronisms and does not hesitate to bring some real modern cops into his picture and they even arrest the crowned King Arthur and make him climb into the black maria. No problem for that humorist. And the cops even block the camera, though they do not destroy the film. Some might say that they could have done that to save us an hour and a half of s**t, but that would be unfair because after all there is something fascinating in such exaggerated and overblown humour. Nothing is sacred with them and that may revive your self-criticism to see such ridiculing of what is considered as everyday banality.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B00009ATIX|1.0|This Movie Had the potential of being good. A drifting spacecraft spinning around a strange planet with a crew going mad.... Earth sends Clooney to rescue the crew and solve the eriee mystery of &quot;Solaris&quot;. Sounds good ,doesnt it? But instead when Clooney gets there we are treated to a maddening experience ourselves.. a movie with little plot. Basically the movie revolves around the fact that the planet or the ship itself or a alien on board can bring thoughts to life. With that said it re-creates Clooneys dead wife(who he misses very much) and then the viewer is treated to many multiple scenes of them that make little sense. Instead of solving the mystery Clooney lets himself slip deep in the dream state the planet has created. Although he goes in and out of this state he wants his wife alive again no matter the cost and to hell with the crew and his mission. He pops pills and lays around in a dream state that plunges us all into a deep slumber before the end of the movie.  I still dont really know what this movie was about, lost love? space rescue? human desires? inner mind? I would pass on this one.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first purchased this CD, I was hoping for the music to expand beyond the over-played 'one-hit-wonder' Bring Me To Life- and surely, enough, it exceeded WAY beyond my expectations! Fallen is emotionally powerful and tragic, while managing to not cross over the line into 'sappy' and also please the teens' and radiowaves punk-rock stylings. Definitely one of the best of 2003! Give them a listen- especially my personal faves 'Tourniquet' and 'Whisper'- you won't be disappointed!
B000092ZYX|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? With each new record release, Radiohead jumps light-years ahead of its competition. As with most Radiohead albums, this one takes a little time to settle in to; at first the music can be a little unsettling. Then you begin to understand its profound genious. From the beginning interference of &quot;2+2=5,&quot; to the end notes of &quot;Wolf at the Door,&quot; the album melts together to create a surreal music experience. It is very hard to describe in words (although others have done a better job than I have); you simply must listen to understand its beauty.
B0000DC14V|5.0|Folks, the average review for this movie is 3 of 5, and that  is ridiculous. This is a western Classic to be sure for the following reasons. The outstanding performances turned in by two Hollywood legends as well as a tremendous supporting cast. Also, this DVD has a solid story that acts as a foundation that carries the movie throughout. The sub-plots include revenge, forbidden love, betrayal, and greed. All of this and we haven't even discussed that this movie has some of the greatest outdoor scenes ever put on film. This is not your typical western with the typical 50's sterotypes. This story introduces us to the anti-hero before that term became vougue some years later. This is a must see DVD for anyone who loves westerns.
0061091480|5.0|In my personal development quest, Wayne Dyer is one of the best.  Many people consider his (and many others) methods to be &quot;too simplistic&quot; or they say that if you're already satisfied with yourself, by all means skip this book, but if you are human, and are not perfect, you will find something very useful in this book, whatever it may be, to assist you in becoming the person you want to be.
B000089RVX|5.0|Caught the Montreal show last week and it was GREAT!!!!<BR>If you got the chance go and see Amy because they were awesome...<BR>She played a couple of tracks not on the CD and they alone were worth the ticket price...<BR>Recommend this to all...<BR>That India guy must have his head up a certain orifice!!!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|This was an awful sequel to the original matrix. Who ever wrote this sequel is an idiot. Do not buy. Most of dialog does not make sense, their was way too much slow-downs and fightings, and their was not much of a story dialog. Do not let your teen watch this sequel.
B000089RVX|3.0|Take all the &quot;kewl&quot; things from popular music and mix them into one band.  Crunchy, if uninspired, alt metal riffs, a touch of electronica-style synth and effects, angry pseudo-rap chants and an emotive female singer, some toned-down piano lines and cello for authenticity, and voila!<BR>It's catchy, entertaining, but don't be expected for any outrageously creative songwriting.  Although, they do have the potential to become important.
B000002WPI|5.0|This was the album that sparked the legendary careers of the Wu Tang Clan and its members. A type of group that you will only see once because any other 9 member group will be labeled as a Wu rip off and even if someone is able to avoid that title, there is almost no way you could get 9 mc's as good as the members of Wu. This ground breaking record is one of the most raw and creative master pieces ever. With hardcore beats from Rza that are different from any other beats people have put out. The 9 members of the clan have incredible mic skills and some of them are up there lyrically with the best of all time. You will NOT hear any of these mc's rapping about what many modern day rappers do, there lyrics are not about bling and getting krunk, they are thought provoking sentiments from each mc on every track. The rawness is introduced right away on &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; with the outstanding track &quot;Bring Da Ruckus&quot;. Every verse on the track is raw, thought felt, and witty, and Rza chimes in with a yelling chourus of bring da ruckus. The following track take some  of the hardcore sense out of it and has more of a funky beat allowing the clan to show versatitlty, &quot;Shame on a N**ga&quot;. ODB brings in this track and the untained mc unleashes an excellent verse. &quot;Clan in Da Front&quot; begins to reintroduce the rawness but then it switches up into a hard piano beat where Gza just rips it, maybe lyrcially the best in the group. He stays very intelligent and quick throughout the track, staying calm but still bringing it  hard. On &quot;7th Chamber&quot; the clan rips on a hard sortof spooky beat but it is very listenable. Rza brings another type of beat for &quot;Can it be All so Simple&quot; where the group takes you back to their younger days. The beat sounds like a gust of wind blowing in the background with a wind shield wipers sounding bump out front. They bring you back with there witty rhymes of back in the days and you jump into there stories. &quot;Mystery of Chessboxin&quot; brings in some more rawness with a eerie piano key hitting every few seconds. &quot;Wu Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing Ta F' Wit&quot; brings you in like Da ruckus with a yelling out the song title and the same as the opening, you feel it. The clan members that spit on this track each demonstrate their own style over Rza's hard driven beat and chorus. &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot; the big single on the album has a very easy piano beat from Rza and Raekwon opens up the track and it is also a recolection of the old days, Meth brings in the catchy chourus. &quot;Method Man&quot; is the best track on the album and it is a showcase for the most popular and first solo artist of the group, Meth. He basically spits about getting messed up and he actually sings in the second verse. &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot; follows the criteria of many of the tracks on the album, and it is a pass the mic track with a pretty good beat. &quot;Tearz&quot; has less of a hard driven beat but it is one of the lesser superb tracks on the album. The album ends with &quot;7th Chamber&quot; over a different beat but at the end of this one, there is clip saying &quot;never teach the Wu tang style&quot; which I feel is a clever way to end the album. This creative masterpiece is not for strictly pop rap fans, the strange beats will throw you off point if you are not prepared for them but for any true rap fan, it is essential for your collection.
B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes have charged into the American mainstream as one of the first classic bands of the new decade. &quot;Elephant&quot; is their masterpiece, an album that shows with startling clarity how two people with nothing but a guitar and drums can create music that rocks harder and has a more timeless feel than anything Godsmack, Disturbed or Linkin Park have produced with their array of synths, guitars, basses and who knows what else. In fact, it has already become legendary that the White Stripes recorded &quot;Elephant&quot; with equipment PRE-DATING The Beatles. Is &quot;Elephant&quot; their &quot;Revolver?&quot; In a sense yes. The songs here feel more focused than in their previous work. &quot;Fell In Love With A Girl&quot; was a great, insane jam, but here the band impresses more with their depth and clarity. &quot;Seven Nation Army,&quot; already a modern classic, opens the album with a crawling hook and announces the Stripes as major players. Jack White recites with a cool edge and does a devilish slide guitar. &quot;There's No Room For You Here&quot; sounds incredible for a band of only two people, it soars and crunches. Fans will be delighted to hear Meg White try out her pipes with &quot;In The Cold Cold Night,&quot; a passive, evocative moment. Those who enjoy The White Stripes at their looniest need not worry, &quot;Hypnotize&quot; brings things back to the basics with it's driving beat. Jack White is a unique vocalist, his voice is a mix of classic hard rock, Punk, there are moments when he calls up the spirit of both Queen and Iggy Pop or The Beatles. Meg White shows off how intricate simple drumming can be. &quot;Elephant&quot; is for those who want to rock, it isn't simple garage rock, it's ROCK. The White Stripes are a vital new force and there's a gut feeling that eventhough it will be hard to top a hit like &quot;Seven Nation Army,&quot; greater material is still to come.

0156421178|5.0|What a riveting account! Orwell manages the difficult task of successfully combining the details of trench life, the description of the turmoils in Barcelona and a comprehensible analysis of the clash of several left-wing political parties during the Spanish Civil war. He even adds some deliciously humorous remarks! And the whole thing is absolutely entertaining, vivid and interesting.<br />Really, one finishes this book and feels a deep respect for this man. It's discouraging to learn that he and so many others who had fought in the trenches had to flee the country or suffer inprisonment and even death, only due to the deep struggle for power between political forces that belonged to the same side! I was impressed by how Orwell describes the passion and idealism that prevailed during the 1930's, specially compared to the sleepy, double-standard ethics of nowadays. <br />As a Spaniard, I admit not possesing deep knowledge about the Spanish Civil War, other than some family recollections and the usual basics. This book helped me learn about the complexities of the &quot;red&quot; side and about the everyday miseries of war.<br />Highly recommended!!
0736657134|5.0|I'll limit myself to two points, other reviewers having done handsomely.<br />__First versus later:__<BR>This opener novel in the series is more packed with action than a full three of the later novels. In a sense, it's like riding a nervous horse. Full of excitement, but a bit giddy, a bit dizzying. In later novels, O'Brian becomes more assured, so that by the time of the amazing `The Surgeon's Mate,' there's more room for sweeping politics, history and above all comedy. <br />The point is, O'Brian is an amazingly funny writer. With astounding erudition, natural as well as philosophic knowledge, broad comedy is the last thing you'd expect. `Master and Commander' doesn't quite do justice to O'Brian's wit, and of course, neither does the film. But be of good cheer: the comic heights of Jagiello wooing a Parisian shopkeeper are only a short way off. <br />Finally and foremost, Stephen Maturin doesn't have as much to do in this first novel. Two or three books later, he's developed into maybe the greatest intelligence agent in literature. <br />__The nautical detail:__<BR>Significant detail is everything in fiction. While on the one hand, a love of immersive detail leads O'Brian to spare us no nautical terms, it also leads to wonderful acquaintance with the world of the early nineteenth century. In later books we marvel at such things as the importing of fully dressed dolls from Paris to keep Londoners aware of fashion, the existence of a `keeper of the cranes' in the court of an Ottoman official and the early days of ballooning. If need be, let the nautical terms go. There's infinite richness to get to. <br />And there is always the companion lexicon.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I purchased Afterglow as an avid fan. I was so disappointed in the reviews of her album, but I wouldn't let that deter me from hearing it myself. I relate to her so closely both mentally and artistically, that I knew that I could rely on her to walk in the same path this time in my life.  And she does, always. This album is another masterpiece. Her beautiful harmonies, her whispered prayers, her high pitched pleas, and still another inner seeking soldier waiting for judgement and hoping for redemption. This album packs no less punch than her previous albums, Fumbling and Surfacing included. Where Fumbling was more desperation, anger, and frustration, this one might be a calmer.  But it is no less potent. There is a calmer resolve. But do we want her to make angry, desperate, pleading, aching albums for the rest of her life? She knows emotion and turns it into music so beautifully, so magically. BUY this album!  You will love it, move with it, and know it like you know... yourself.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney has really shown us in this album that she is still a number 1 singer. In The Zone is the album that britney should have been!! She proves that shes not a pop-princess and that she is for real. You go girl!! Some of the songs on this album are really good. Justin should be spewing!!
0792164903|5.0|I loved this movie almost as much as Edward Scissorhands. It is a fantastic moody atmospheric horror movie. The story is fantastic.
1577311523|5.0|As many people have said, the conscious realization of the power of the moment occurs only when we are at an appropriate time in life. As you can see from many of the reviews, the people who were ready, found this book helpful but for those who did not, it only made partial sense. This is a fabulous book but in order to find it so, we must be ready ourselves. As Toru Sato says in &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot;, we grow when we are ready and only when we are ready.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This movie is really sweet amd a little quirky. Shake in some Chaplin style comedy and you have a winning match. Wow. I can't like this movie more.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I think John Mayer is a great singer and guitar player.  He is young, but I think his music is insightful beyond his years.  I also don't think it is a copy of Dave Matthews.  It is original and refreshing.  I am eagerly awaiting more releases from him.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|i'm going to rate this album 5 stars because it seems that a &quot;single&quot; hater regularly logs on as &quot;music fan&quot; and keeps putting in lowest ratings because he can't stand Britney.  such a shame that there are some people who have nothing better to do with their time and get jealous of someone like Britney who works very hard to get where she's at.  maybe if this person spent more time doing real things/ambitions they would go somewhere.  anyways this CD is very good.  i wouldn't say it's her best because i actually favor Britney when she sings the soft songs and there are a few in this CD.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I will admit at first it took a while to grow on me but I love this cd.&quot;Push&quot; sounds like classic Sarah.I think it should be the new single.&quot;The Answer&quot; is great.&quot;I don't know why you all are being so harsh on her.A artist cannot make the same album over and over again.If she was to make FTE over again then everyone would say she sounds exactly the same on all her albums.I personally like the album.I think she has grown as an artist.
B00006L83N|5.0|This CD was my personal introduction to this great band. Thanks to Amazon.com recommendations, I have been opened up to an entire genre of music that I've been missing out on. Never have I been so blown away by any single work such as Odyssey. There is not a single weak track. This is a band that makes it obvious they truly put their every heart and soul into their art. I won't bore you with track details. Just know that if you are considering purchasing this CD, just do it. You will not be disappointed.
B000002UJQ|5.0|for years to come in my mind.  This is truely a masterpiece.  A one of a kind album that comes around once every few years.  Their is a reason why this album was nominated for Album of the Year from the Grammys and you should find out for yourself.  One of my most treasured albums and ive literally played the cd so much I may have to buy another one just because of the usage. I have no problems rating this CD 5 stars. plz listen and enjoy it!
B0000TB050|5.0|I was at Slane the 25th of August so I was anxious to get this DVD and compare it to the great time I had at the concert held week before.<br />The camera style is fast, close and a bit rough. It would have been nice to see better some of the visuals (all the light - text, stars, etc.) which are not revealed unless the whole stage is shown, as seen from the audience away from the stage.  I guess you have to get the Boston DVD for all the extra camara work!<br />The tone is a bit different between the 25th and the 1st, mainly because of the death of Bono's father and the funeral day before the earlier concert. On this DVD there is less &quot;drama&quot; regarding that and I feel I was lucky to have been on the earlier concert for that moment. Still the same, you can feel the crowd, the music is great and the band is active, having fun.<br />There are not many features extra that make any differance.  I feel there could have been more, about Slane and the concerts, U2 - but hey, the concert is great and you get the feeling they are live at your home. <br />I have not tryed the DVD ROM features but I understand you can see few songs 360 degrees, which is great I guess, but I would like the sound to be the same as in my DTS DVD player instead of a computer speakers. As said before, if you want more camera angles, you get the Boston Elevation Tour (also?) !<br />Bottom line, extra features are thumbs down and the event as live, rough with great sound is five thumbs up!<br />Because I don't care about the extra features it gets five stars and recommendation for anyone wanting to be in LIVE mood!<BR>Subtract one and a half star if you expect something extra.
B00004XONN|5.0|but after listening to it a dozen or so times i was really enjoying the songs more and more.  Ive followed Radiohead ever since thier debut album &quot;pablo honey&quot; and have bought every album up until &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;.  This album I believe marks a turning point in the style of Radiohead.  Theyve always had a very unique sound but this album more than any is very beat based and uses samples and syntheisized sounds to create some really beautiful pieces of music. Ok computer had small hints at what thier sounds was going into, but i never thought it would come close to anything like this album. I agree with some of the other reviewers in the fact that this music is not for everybody.  Some people will really enjoy it while others will only listen to it once or be turned off by some of the vibes. Even for people who are use to other Radiohead CD's like OK Computer or the Bends, when you hear this CD you will think, &quot;Is this really Radiohead?&quot;  It is and thank goodness they are. This is the band going through evolution, changing and making new ground.  Evolving like the world, changing from a catepillar to a butterfly.  It really is something to cherish and enjoy.  I hope future generations of music listeners can enjoy this wonderful album as much as I do and I recommend it to any music lover. Each cut is a Gem, you may like some songs more than others but try them all out and give them a fair shot. Ill bet youll press play more than once.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I love this CD and I'm so glad that she finally decided to do a x-mas album.. I knew she would be great.. There are a few songs where you can tell either she wasnt too interested in the song or her voice might have been overused for the day.. But the song selection is great (every song fits with the next) and when she's feeling the song, so is everyone else listening.. My favorite song would have to be &quot;O Holy Night&quot;.. It is my favorite x-mas song of all time (by most singers, really).. But just like &quot;I will always love you, I'm every woman, The greatest love of all, etc&quot;, she has taken this song and made it hers.. I swear, I get chills up my spine when she (without any trouble) holds those beautiful notes forever.. This CD would get 5 stars just for the song. I've never heard a singer sing this song so well and I'm glad she included it.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|This was a great piece of works, and while it recycles the work of others, what, (and I'd love to say 'especially in these days', but, let's face it, people have been sledging off of each other for some time now) doesn't?  This is one of the freshest, most individual reworks of the old days, (that sounds good) you could find.<br />But let's discount the 'old days'.<br />With a little too much affrontory, 'Robbie Digital' waltzes in announcing that Jet is just another \\"The Hives, The Strokes, The White Stripes, and The Vines.\\"  Lads, that's just not how it's happening.  In no way do I put down any of these artists work, (being mostly a fan) but in what world of rock is there comparison?  Brings into mind one claiming that the Dandy Warhols and Machine Gun Fellatio are one and the same.  <br />No.  Jet is not the vines.  Jet is not a dyslexic mainstream group reminicent of a mid-eighties punk garage, (say...MxPx?) Get Born is not Get Free.  Three words.  Dedication.  Class.  Leather.  (...should have left that last one out)<br />Jet is not the White Stripes because, geez, I dream of marrying a man with a voice like Nic's, not a pale kid who screams his head off.  (Mind you, Hotel Yorba= class A)<br />Jet is not the Strokes, (let's face it, they aren't a group of rich boys from the suburbs...that's got nothing to do with what I'm on about) while both sounds are great, they are independant of each other, Jet is classically rock, while the strokes are something completely different.  Voice alone leaves something to be desired on Is This It, and Room on Fire, while it all sounds great, it does get kind of hollow; never really happening with that growl.<br />It's no use passing them off as another face in the mass, because Jet DO bring something different.  Sure it's not as worked as the Strokes, and doesn't have as much airtime as the vines, but isn't it meant to be the rawness, heck, the honesty that's meant to be appealing about rock?
B0000CNY27|5.0|Revised for Blu-ray Edition: 4/15:<br /><br />Five years ago MGM via Fox released a bare bones version of the movie on Blu-ray tha improved on the previous DVD but without ANY of the special features ported over. While the transfer looked pretty good, the lack of extras (especially given that MGM had just released a 2 disc DVD with special features including the original laserdisc commentary track ported over).<br /><br />This new edition arrives with a fresh 2K transfer. It's not a huge step up from the previous blu-ray but there is a slight improvement in quality, depth and detail but, as with all things in high defintion, it does reveal the source limitations.<br /><br />The audio sounds terrific.<br /><br />The special features are ported over from the original DVD plus we get a number of new special feaures including a featurette on the visual effects featuring Dennis and Robert Skotak. There's also a new interview with Kim Gottleig-Walker who did the set photographs and a third audio commentary with Adrienne Barbeau & Director of Photography Dean Cundey. and production designer Joe Alves.  All of the special features except the audio commentaries are on disc two allowing for maximum bit rate for the film.<br /><br />Just a tip--if you order from Shout Factory's website they will deliever most of their titles a couple of weeks before release date and they have occasional goodies that aren't available elsewhere as well.<br /><br />Revised for the Blu-ray Edition 8/24/10:<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the Blu-ray edition (my old review for the deluxe 2 DVD set is below). Fox which is distributing MGM titles presents &#34;Escape&#34; with a truly stunning looking transfer. After years believing the original negative was missing, it was located and used to create a new print for both the new improved 2 disc set and this Blu-ray. The film has never looked as detailed, had as much depth or had colors as accurate as this edition but Fox has chosen to release this without ANY extras ported over from the previous edition.<br /><br />There's the rub.<br /><br />Since the material already exists and the target audience for reissued Blu-rays are HD fanatics, Fox has completely missed the boat here. Ultimately, it's about the quality of the film and it looks and sounds stunning BUT fans will want to keep their 2 disc DVD edition because it has all the extras on it.<br /><br />Aside from the stunning looking transfer for the film what do you get?<br /><br />On the Blu-ray you get nothing in the way of special features.<br /><br />There IS a DVD edition of the film included with the Blu-ray but Fox has chosen to redistribute the earliest DVD incarnation which was a dual sided disc featuring both the widescreen and full screen presentation of the film (which will tell you how old the transfer is)in a poor DVD presentation. The original trailer is presented as well on the DVD.<br /><br />Why did they do this? Perhaps to milk fans later with a deluxe edition or perhaps it was sheer laziness on the part of Fox. It reminds me a bit of the whole &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; fiasco of the theatrical editions with the old documentaries released and no extended editions included.<br /><br />Either way, the film DOES look exceptional and it IS worth picking up again for the improved image quality (particularly if amazon continues its discounted price for the disc). My advice--pick it up, find a 3 Blu-ray holder and keep the 2 disc DVD edition making your own &#34;deluxe&#34; edition.<br /><br />Hopefully Fox will get it together and realize that they are making these reissues for fans of the film who would like to have EVERYTHING. It is, indeed, worthwhile to &#34;Escape&#34; with one of John Carpenter's finest films I just wish that Fox had would do right by the fans.<br /><br />Recommended (even if Fox is screwing fans of the film)<br /><br />(2 Disc DVD Review from 2003 below):<br /><br />Although this two DVD set has a bit of padding,Escape from New York The Special Edition is a huge improvement on the original DVD release from a couple of years ago. It's 1997 Manhattan Island is now a prison with no guards and prisoners left to fend for themselves. The Air Force One en route to an important conference with the Soviet Union and Chinese Government is hijacked by a group of political terrorists. The President, who was set to present important information at the conference, and the rest of the crew go down inside the walls of the prison.<br /><br />Snake Plissken is a decorated war veteran who has become a notorious outlaw. When captured Plissken is sentenced to the Island prison. Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) recognizes Plissken and hatches a plan to get the president and the vital info out; send in Plissken to retreive both. Hauk has two microscopic explosives planted in Plsseken's head to make him do his end of the bargain in return Hauk has arranged a pardon.<br /><br />Escape is among Carpenter's best films and one of his most visually dazzling ones as well. Despite working with a budget of around $6 million, Carpenter works wonders using real locations, sets and outstanding miniature work to bring Escape to life.<br /><br />Any film is only as good as its central performance and Kurt Russell's irony etched performance as Snake echo's Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name or even Dirty Hairy without apeing them. He still manages to bring the character to life using the popular anti-heroes Eastwood embodied to sketch the character. He brings flesh and bone to the performance. Lee Van Cleef is perfect as Snake's foil (as he was for Eastwood in two of the films in the Dollars trilogy). Rounded out by an excellent cast (Ernest Borgnine, Adriene Barbeau, Harry Dean Stanton as Brian (aka Harold),Issac Hayes as the Duke of New York and, of course, Donald Pleasance as the President) Escape from New York manages to out perform its modest origin.<br /><br />This deluxe edition is a marked improvement over the previous edition. The high definition transfer isn't marred with a lot of analog or digital compression problems (although there are a few minor compression issues evident)and the remastered sound is generally very good.<br /><br />The extras are very good as well; there's two audio commentaries (one of them sounds very similar to the one Carpenter did for the laserdisc edition but given that it's the same film discussed only years apart that's not a surprise). Carpenter and Russell are the most entertaining on the audio commentary tracks while Hill and production designer Joe Alves (Close Encounters and Jaws)provide additional insight on the second.<br /><br />Disc two features the complete bankrobbery sequence cut from the opening of the original film by Carpenter (he's right--it wasn't really necessary and the film works much better without it). There's also a fine featurette discussing the film's origin and impact featuring new interviews with Russell, Hill, Carpenter and others from the production crew. The second feaurette focuses on the creation and final production of the comic book based on the character. An issue of the final product is included in miniature form. While it isn't relevent to the film directly, it's interesting nonetheless.<br /><br />There's the usual theatrical trailers and an odd feaurette that focuses on key scenes of Russell and music cues from the film. You probably won't watch the latter more than once. The photo gallery is pretty good although there isn't anything earthshattering revealed.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of accordion packaging and that's the single flaw with this package. Otherwise, the design of the packaging is top notch and attractive. The cardboard packaging will probably not stand up to wear and tear well, so I'd suggest getting a couple of snap cases to put the film in and storing the packaging if you're a collector.<br /><br />One of Carpenter's finest films finally gets the respect it deserves and the deluxe treatment on DVD. The transfer is exceptional with a few minor flaws and the extras are only icing on the cake. The inclusion of the Snake Plessken comic book is a nice extra as well that will probably disappear with later reissues.

0345404475|5.0|By now, most people are familiar with the book because of the movie, Blade Runner, which frankly fails to capture those qualities that make the book special. Let's face it, Dick was a hack writer, but a fascinating philosopher. Read Dick for his boundlessly thought provoking ideas. In Androids Dream, he is principally concerned with the questions:    If the ability of humans to manipulate logic can be modelled in machines, and machines are extensions of human intelligence, then what does it mean to be human? Can there be Artificial Intelligence? If so, can it be distinguished from Natural Intelligence? How so?    Obviously, Dick believes the difference is empathy, a notion that derived from an early childhood experience of his own. He was torturing a beetle, and observing the beetles struggles to survive, when he had a full blown satori--that he and the beetle were the same, they were alike in their striving for existance and their avoidance of pain. It was a life changing moment, he later would claim, and that theme is a the heart of this novel, and is reminiscient of Blakes poem, \\"The Fly\\". But his point goes deeper than this. He seems to want us to think about how we humans can lose our humanity and behave as if we have become machine-like. If we sacrifice our free will, our creativity, our ability to say yes, or no, independently; if we sacrifice our conscience--and blindly commit ourself to be governed by a set of external rules--then we have become computer programs, not human beings. And he seems to imply that this is how places like Auschwitz came to exist, built by human beings who had become machines that are exceptionally good at following orders. Around the world, we have political machines, economic machines, marketing machines, martial machines. In Cambodia, a political and military machine consisting mostly of children forced millions of people from the homes into the fields to be mowed down like so many insects.    The points that Dick makes are important--extrememly important, to an authentic human being who has not sacrificed their humanity or abdicated their sense of responsibility to a set of rules. But his particular genius lies in his ability to paint different, contradictory views and interpretations of the same reality. This ability conveys a peculiar paranoid sense of reality that is as eerie as it is profound. It gives a strong sense of what it must feel like to experience a psychotic break with reality. That may be a strange roller coaster ride, but it helps to create a sense of empathy. That sense of empathy is increasingly hard to come by in the age of multi-media.    Are there forces intent upon controlling your behavior? Are there forces striving to elicit in you a programmed response to targeted stimuli? Are you compelled to hunger for certain things that you must own, to embrace certain ideas that flatter your sense of self fantasy? Do you drive a car a gunslinger or cattle barron would be proud to own? Own a stove you might find in the kitchen of an Iron Chef? Have the marketing moguls exploited our own sense of vanity to turn us into consuming machines? Have they used similar techniques to influence our thinking about politics? Religion? Science?    Is a machine capable of resisting attempts to reprogram its software? Only if sufficient security features have been built in to it. So you might ask yourself, what are the security features built into you that might equip you to resist those forces that want to program and thus control you? Could it be doubt, skepticism, and the ability to say NO? Who stands to win by turning you into a machine? What is their agenda? Is this harmful to your best interests? Is your true nature to be a machine? What did your face look like before your mother was born? Doubt, and live free. Be sceptical, and find liberty. Belief, is mechanical. Distrust is organic. A wild animal is wary. A tame sheep is easily lead to slaughter.
0060573775|5.0|Ethan Hawke is a wonderful reader who captures the dreamlike quality of this novel.  Extra-special is the interview with vonnegut at the end of the CD.  Plus, this is an unabridged text - the only way to listen to classics on audio.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This CD set is a real treasure to all people who have taken an interest, no matter what size,in Pink Floyd. For the newer fans out there, there is something for everyone: great hits that sound familiar (I know the first song I skipped right to when I got this was Another Brick in the Wall Pt 2), and samples of earlier works, (songs like One of these Days and Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun). The booklet tells which albums each song came from- I built my Floyd CD collection mostly based on the booklet/insert. For the older fans, this has a couple of rare singles that really aren't found anywhere else, except Relics, such as See Emily Play, Arnold Layne, and When The Tigers Broke Free.  In the true Floyd tradition, the songs are rearranged in a beautiful way- each song segues right into the other perfectly. If you don't know what I am talking about- listen to Marooned and the Great Gig in the Sky together- the two songs sound like they are meant to be together, though they came from two diffrent albums.  I am happy with the selection of songs that are included- almost every CD they have made is represented- even The Final Cut. I am especially grateful for the inclusion of both Echoes and Shine On, even if they were edited. Everyone and anyone who is interested in this band should check this CD out- you won't regret it.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|easily the best album of '03, Waking the Fallen will most likely go more or less unheard of. that's a crying shame, because these five guys deserve way more credit and recognition than they will ever get. trying to pass themselves off as a punk band for reasons i can't begin to understand (they are much more talented and creative than most punk bands that have hit the scene lately), they are more easily likened to old school metal with a new school twist. huck in some decidedly Christian-themed lyrics, and you've got Ax7. their two guitarists merge and play off each other flawlessly, the bass perfectly fills in the spaces left by the guitars, and the drums are crystal clear. and the vocals. oooohhh, the vocals are something worth writing home about. M Shadows has a very good vocal range and can whip out scales and arpeggios like nobody's business. and this boy can SCREAM! with lyrics that come off sounding like something by Poe if he was living today crossed with a Cradle of Filth that wrote about God instead of Satan, you can't go wrong. i've listened to this at least 30 times since i bought it three weeks ago, and i'm still dissecting and enjoying every second of it. buy this for yourself or for someone who has lost hope in hard rock and metal. you won't be disappointed.
B000001ES9|5.0|The band's first album and one of their most powerful. Scorching vocals and searing guitar work marked this work as the beginning of a new Canadian rock dynasty. They've moved away from this kind of power but have continued producing quality music for nearly 30 years now. And, they can still crank it up every once in a while, as proven by a later song: &quot;Spit it out&quot;
0385512104|5.0|It's pretty well known that The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is the story of an 15 year old autistic boy seeking to solve the &quot;mystery&quot; of who has murdered the beloved dog of a neighbor.<br />What is not as well known and something you should consider as you begin to read is that this book is told from the perspective of the 15-year-old child, not a neutral narrator. It is the main character of the novel that is telling you his story. At first it may be difficult to get into the flow of the story because you must first become used to the fact that the narration is firstly very detailed and logical, and secondly very prone to going off on tangents that have little to do with the main plot of the book.<br />However, it is this different style of writing that gives the book its authenticity and makes it a joy to read. The author himself is not autistic, but he captures both the patterns of logical and detail-oriented thinking, as well as the random tangents into comfortable territory (for the child), and gives the reader the feel that they are being told the story first hand.<br />Not only does the story present a very interesting plot with twists and turns and unexpected results, but it also educates us as to just how brilliant are the minds and touching are the lives of autistic people.<br />If you enjoy easy to read fiction that can both educate and entertain simultaneously, the you will like this book. Give yourself time to adjust to the different story-telling method and you'll feel great about the experience.
B00000DGRX|5.0|I agree with most reviewers on the sound quality of this remastered album.  Simply amazing!  I have tried several remastered albums from other bands but this is absolutely the best.  <br />No need to say about Deep purple music.  If you are new to Deep Purple, listening to this and you will be surprised that Deep Purple is not as popular as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd... in North Anerica.  DP 's music (any DP Mark) is much better than any of those bands.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Having fallen in love with the show, it's score and idea. I can only say that It's the best Broadway show I've ever seen &amp; heard.  I've never been more in love with a story or show. If you get the chance, go see Wicked!!! You wont regret it! The sets, costumes and actors are all Wickedly Awesome!!!!!!!!!!
B00000HZFP|5.0|A cult hit on the New York circuit several years ago, \\"Hedwig\\" proved to be only as successful as its leading man/woman, in this case John Cameron Mitchell(when Ally Sheedy took over, the talk wasn't so hot). Thank God then that we have this document of the raw, wild, blistering original stage performance of Mitchell(with songs by Stephen Trask, the unsung co-star). Not even the movie soundtrack can compare to this cast CD, with vocals torn from Mitchell's delightfully schizo psyche(he's bruised woman, battered man, deflated diva and hollow lover--all at once!). \\"Wicked Little Town\\"(and the reprise)has got to be one of the most beautiful, personal laments committed to record, and the imagination and beautiful power of \\"Origin of Love\\", with its history altering images, ranks a close second. I don't see how anyone could not come away from this musical journey with his or her eyes opened and heart completely filled. An EXPERIENCE.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This DVD was absolutely insane, I truly thought I was at the concert.  To start off, the Chilis ROCKED this place...the music was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE, from beginning to end (which was a LOOOOOOONG time), they made my jaw drop (again), and I'm sure they did to the 80 000 people watching it live.  I'll stop talking about the actual show, because anyone who knows the Chili Peppers understands that they put on the best live concert in the world.  So, onto the next great part of this DVD, which is the actual way it was put together.  Unlike &quot;Off the Map&quot;, this DVD includes new technology and way more extras than the older DVD.  First and foremost, the picture is INCREDIBLE, I hear it was filmied digitally (whatever that means), but all I can say is that it was the most crisp picture that I have ever seen.  Furthermore, the filming of this concert was insane.  The transitions flowed so nicely, and the multiple angle changes made the best live concert DVD I have ever watched.  Finally, my favorite part of the entire DVD was the 'freeze and 180 degree view' (kind of like what you see in 'The Matrix')...it was done SO well, not overused, and only at the appropriate times.  I actually sat down and watched this DVD from beginning to end even though I had hours of work to do, it was just that amazing.  I have seen the Chilis live three times, and I have to say that not only does this DVD entirely encapture the live experience, it somehow makes it even better.  Whether your're a big Chili fan or not, and even if you have all the other Chili DVDs, not buying this DVD would be a HUGE mistake
B0000630BT|5.0|If you were to look Heavy Metal up in the dictionary, Painkiller just might be the definition.  If an alien landed in your cornfield and asked you, &quot;What is this 'heavy metal' I've been hearing about?&quot;, Painkiller is most likely the album you would lend to him.  Although not my personal favorite Priest album(though not far off), it really sums up the term &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; in image lyrics and music.  Where else do you get to hear meaningless Heavy Metal-type lyrics like, &quot;Cross cutting thundercharge/Blade of destruction/Flame throwing hurricane destroys the cage?&quot;  I'll tell you where else......NOWHERE ELSE!  It's all here on Painkiller.  Buy it, kiddies, and listen to it while you drive!
B0000CDL3W|5.0|With a movie of this genre, the viewer must dispense with some sense of reality and logic, but unlike I was expecting, the film doesn't expect you to dispense with your forebrain.<br />Nick Stahl has proven himselve as a superb actor in such films as \\"The Man Without A Face,\\" and he does an excellent job as the slightly older John Connor, savior of humanity.<br />Like its predecessors, this movie's plot focuses around the self-aware machines of the future sending a terminator back in time to destroy Connor before he can become the resistance leader that will save humanity and triumph over the world of the machines.<br />I'm unsure why Sarah Connor's character (John's mother) was killed off in this film - perhaps they didn't want to spend the money for Linda Hamilton to reprise her role, or else she didn't want to be in it - but her character was a weighty element that was missed in this installment.<br />Connor's childhood aquaintance, Kate (Claire Danes), finds herself intertwined in the story as \\"Judgement Day\\" spirals toward inevitability.  Schwarzenegger is back  as the \\"good\\" Terminator sent back through time once again to protect John and members of his soon to be formed resistance movement as an even more kick-butt Terminator, the T-X, is sent back to eliminate the resistance and contaminate the timeline by infusing future technology with current technology.<br />Kirstanna Loken's acting debut is impressive as the sleek, heartless Terminatrix - she has the liquid metal properties of her predecessor in \\"T2,\\" but unlike him, she can also turn into complex machines such as saws and drills and she even has a blood/DNA screening device so that if she pokes somebody she can tell if they are part of the resistance or not as she goes down her cyber checklist of people to eliminate.<br />Reviews have been mixed and I went to the theater with mediocre expectations, and ended up pleasantly surprised. With the exception of one scene, the special effects are flawless. There is one scene in which the T-X is in a bay with high-tech military robotic machines in which several dozen are supposed to be in the background, but it is nauseatingly obvious they are CGI and painted in the background. Despite this one overt SFX flaw, the action scenes are inventive, entertaining and incredible.<br />The dialogue is punchy and to the point. I wasn't too impressed with the acting of the Kate's fiancee, but his screentime was minimal. Overall, this is one exciting, entertaining flick.  No sex scenes, but loads of violence - so think twice before exposing kids under 13. Any adult into Sci-Fi will not be disappointed.re is one scene in which the T-X is in a bay with high-tech military robotic machines in which several dozen are supposed to be in the background, but it is nauseatingly obvious they are CGI and painted in the background.

B00005K9LN|5.0|What's that mean?  It means this is the Judas Priest album that everyone bought.  In the eyes of the American media it also seems to be the only album Judas Priest ever recorded-or at least the only album that's any good.  All JP and metal fans know this isn't true, but there's no denying how good this album is.  I don't know about you, but I don't skip over one song when I listen to this album, I just hit play and let it go to the end.  Priest is in top form here(as usual) and carved their niche in the music world.  Really, who hasn't heard Breakin' The Law?  Aside from that classic, this album gives you much better and lesser known tunes.  You also get those great &quot;metal&quot; lyrics like: &quot;Forging the furnace for the final grand slam.&quot;  If anyone knows what exactly that means, please email me and let me know.  There really isn't anything new I can say about this album, so I won't try.  It's a classic for a reason.  Buy.  Buy now.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This album is argueably the single greatest rock record every assembled, in any rock genre.  This album stretches the bounds of musical appeal, offering fierce, pshycodelic, riffs, as well as an array of ingenious, rich song-writing.  Siameese Dream opened the doors for a more mainstreamed focus of the alternative rock genre, one that spanned the mid to late 1990's.  The over-commercialized trend of popular music seemed to thwart off the Pumpkins, as they recently went their seperate ways.  But Siameese Dream is a testament that their spirit lives on, opening the doors for future, talented alternative rock bands.
B000062Y98|4.0|For better or worse, there isn't a band or album that sounds like this.  Blind Guardian have been slowly morphing from Battalions Of Fear to the sound they're at now.  What will be next I wonder?  I've always had great admiration for this band for being 100% original amongst the dime a dozen Helloween clones that have surfaced throughout the last few years(though Blind Guardian has been around almost as long as Helloween, but who in America cares about good metal music, right?).  This album is quite different from where Blind Guardian started, and hasn't pleased everyone.  That's fine, coz no matter who you are, you're gonna disappoint someone with your new album.  I understand that many could consider this album to be a bit overwhelming with it's operatic/metal/choir vocal assault.  In fact, I can see this album appealing to people who aren't really into metal music.  I could see classical fans or progressive rock fans not exactly loving it, but seeing merit in it.  I wouldn't suggest getting this as your first Blind Guardian album, coz it might rub you the wrong way.  This album you get after you're warmed up to them and have gone on that journey from their thrash albums to their orchestral ones.  By that time, you might be a little more prepared for the sound of this cd.  Personally, I don't think it's Blind Guardian's best album.  It doesn't hook you from the getgo like the rest of their albums do.  It's more like a prog rock album(though not prog rock) in the vein of Yes, where you have to listen to it and absorb it a few times before you start unraveling the layers and discover how good it is underneath the top layer of seemingly unstructured noise.  I can see this album as one of those that's met with hostility now, but will be seen as an essential classic years down the road.  Similar to Hitchcock's Vertigo.  But my personal suggestion would be to start yourself with another BG album(any of them will do-they're all great), and if you really dig it, snatch this baby up.is baby up.

078681859X|5.0|Just when you think that you are getting to the end of what literary wizards can achieve with Rowling and Pullman, along comes Stroud with his brilliant and inventive fantasy. Containing a narrative split between Nathaniel (a boy apprentice wizard and his mischievous djinn (as in genie) Bartimaeus, we are catapulted into an alternative modern London where commoners (such as ourselves) are hardly worth mentioning and wizards rule the government. Our journey follows Nathaniel as he unwittingly steals an amulet from a powerful wizard, Simon Lovelace, as revenge for the boys mistreatment. Little does he know that this theft will unleash a devastating train of events which he seems powerless to prevent. One of the best fantasies I've read for quite sometime. Move over Rowling and Pullman. There's a new kid on the block!
6300263673|4.0|When it was released in 1987, Dirty Dancing was a cultural phenomenon, and it hasn't faded in spite of the fact that it's dated and that the dancing, never really, really dirty, doesn't seem dirty at all, by today's standards.<BR>Patrick Swayze plays a dance instructor pretty-boy at the Catskills resort where Jennifer Grey is vacationing, as she's done every year, with her traditional family. They fall in love (or at least in lust), of course, and of course her father doesn't approve and sees to it that the guy is fired in order to denigrate him in the eyes of everyone and separate him from Grey.<BR>All this is predictable enough, but Grey and Swayze have chemistry, and boy, do they put on some sexy moves with their dancing. If you've never seen it, you're in for a treat. Just put your cynicism and modern worldliness on hold and let yourself be sucked into the spirit of the film. Enjoy it.

1565123875|5.0|If you're not sure which new book to pick, choose one published by Algonquin Press. They seem to select the most consistent string of quiet winners.<BR>Purple Hibiscus is an amazing debut novel about Kambili, a 15yo Nigerian girl who is the keeper of ugly secrets from within her privileged family, a family dominated and abused by her religious fanatic father. She is offered escape when she visits her Aunty Ifeoma, a university lecturer who is supporting her children on her small salary. A tragic conclusion slowly builds as old secrets and new tensions rise to the surface. As Kambili blossoms toward maturity, she questions values she once held as inscribed in stone. Her own turmoil is mirrored in that of her country. A startlingly good coming-of-age novel, disconcerting and thought-provoking.
0192833588|1.0|....&quot;thoroughly unpleasant&quot; was how he found Austen's work, &quot;English in the bad, mean, snobbish, sense of the word.&quot;<br />I wouldn't go that far, but those stilted paragraphs, those arid drawing-rooms, those aristocratic concerns and conceits (how to redo the parlor?  How to arrange for the right guests to see it?) leave me completely exhausted.  The superegoic hatred of impulse; the Dickensian pasteboard moralizing; the conservative exaltation of appropriate manners and self-restraint....The only characters I was able to care about in this novel were the villains--or rather, given Austen's sterilized offsetting of taste versus boorishness, call them negative role models.  And even they did nothing more dramatic than offering an occasional cold shoulder to the well-bred and undeserving.<br />But then I wonder:  perhaps all this is some fantastic satire?  Perhaps the pomposity and the Emily Postian fussiness is a deliberate attempt at humor?  If so, I'm sorry to say it went above my head.<br />Pride and Prejudice is next; I hope it's a more human work than this one was.
014100018X|5.0|Vianne Roche and her daughter waft into a village in rural France, a village ruled by the stern priest, a village beset by little upsets between its people. Vianne opens a chocolate shop, and it quickly becomes clear that she's part good witch, possessed of the power of Cure by Chocolate, able to select just the right piece of confection to heal what ails the individuals who come hesitantly into her store. <BR>The battle lines are drawn as Lent with its strict self-denial drawn near and as a contingent of sybaritic gypsies moors up on the riverbank. And there's a seductive King of the Gypsies who woos Vianne. <BR>This is a tale of good vs evil, sin vs. hedonism, joy vs. guilt - and it's not to be missed. Then go ahead and rent the movie, which is equally stellar.

B00005JKG5|4.0|You just keep waiting for that Oscar-winning title song to come around again; it's gotta be the most joyful, uplifting, foot-stompin', head and hip swinging tune ever written for a movie. Jennifer Beals works as a welder by day, but does sexy dancing in a club at night, practicing constantly for a chance to audition for the formal dance school, tho she'd never had formal training and feels inferior to the others in the audition lines. <BR>As reality, it won't float. But as an energetic and boisterous vehicle for a sweet story and some of the best music and dancing ever seen on screen, it's a five-star winner.
6305014140|1.0|This is one of the worst anime's I have ever seen.  The characters and plot are terrible.  The main 'samurai' seems to have no past besides that a while ago he killed a guy.  Now he must go on this quest to finish him off again, for an asinine reason.  He meets some small old guy, who poisons him.  And he later counter-acts this poison with poison?  WTF?  The plot is asinine, the action is ridiculously stupid, and its ridden with unnecesary sex scences.  I would reccomend to stay away from this, and if you already have bought it, burn it.  If you've already seen it, cut your eyes out and destroy them.  I would prefer many other anime's, like Ruroni Kenshin.  Its just better.
B00000I236|5.0|Kevin Bacon can so beautifully play a sadist, a charming and vicious creep, a bad guy that it's almost like he's not acting. And Meryle Streep, trying her hand here in an action film, NEVER seems to be acting - she's always stellar, completely immersed in her character. In The River Wild, Streep plays a suburban mom and former white-water rafting guide who is taking her family on a raft trip for summer vacation. She's a bit on the outs with her husband, who is, at the last minute, too busy to go along - so she and her son go it alone - and quickly run afoul of some killers on the lam. Bacon and a buddy, of course. They coerce Streep to take them down a terrifyingly dangerous stretch of river rapids to escape from the pursuing cops.<BR>Marvelous. And Streep did all the river scenes without the use of a stunt double - which, if you've ever been white-water rafting on a Class 4 or 5 river, is utterly amazing.

Trust Fox not to give it a chance, like all the other good shows they have dropped maybe someday these will come back to haunt them especially if Fox has to rerun the shows to retain viewers. This is a watchable, interesting, Space Opera exactly how the star wars series started. WATCH IT! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.

0784011176|5.0|\\"The Piano\\" stars Holly Hunter, Sam Neill, Harvey Keitel, and Anna Paquin.  It received several Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.  Its brilliant quality proves that every nomination was deserved.  The plot of a mute woman, Ada, whose only form of expression is through her piano was written beautifully.  Jane Campion's Oscar winning efforts express her highly creative outlook in film.  It combines drama, mystery, and romance.  Many twists and turns arise as Ada falls in love with a mysterious man not her husband.  The movie's gloomy theme blends perfectly with every event; past, present, or future.  It reminds the audience of the danger that certain characters are in, regardless of what they say or do.  The cinematography and the editing wonderfully contribute to this effect.<br />The art design proves that the artists researched the European styles of the 1800's.  Every detail is flawless.  The costumes were equally wonderfully crafted.  Every detail on the set contributes to the movie plot, adding its necessary theme.  <br />Every actor performs their roles beautifully.  Holly Hunter's Best Actress Oscar winning role, Ada, was highly emotional.  Only one other performer has won the Oscar for a lead role for playing a mute person(Marlee Matlin, 1986).  She never holds back a drop of heart and soul through her character.  Her task of expressing her character's emotions through only non-verbal means is highly difficult.  She mastered it.  This is her best role in her career.  Anna Paquin's Best Supporting Actress Oscar winning role, Ada's daughter Flora, is amazing.  This made her the second youngest Oscar winner for acting efforts(age 11).  No words can describe how amazing and how underrated she is.  Her European accent is as flawless as her acting.  Harvey Keitel offers his own mystery theme in his Oscar nominated role as Ada's gothic non-husband lover.  Sam Neill's role as Ada's wife is brilliant.  His character's rage scenes are perfect.  All other actors, major or minor, also perform their roles wonderfully.<br />\\"The Piano\\" offers an amazing roller coaster ride, though some scenes may become highly depressing.  Those looking for a power drama should watch this movie.  This offers high emotions that forces the audience to feel what that characters are feeling.  Many viewers will be entertained throughout.  Some may have to watch this movie multiple times to fully understand the events thoroughly.  Many have watched this ten times, and they continue to discover new, interesting details.  \\"The Piano\\" will be a classic in the upcoming years.

0553213105|4.0|My favorite chapter in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is chapter thirty four because this chapter presented the plot's climax. The author has carefully built the plot so that Darcy's proposal comes at the height of Elizabeth's anger toward him. This chapter presents a new obstacle in the plot, Darcy's proposal to Elizabeth, who promptly turns him down. If Darcy had worded his proposal in a romantic way, Elizabeth would have reacted differently, but Darcy's pride makes him act in a superior way. When he proposes, he indicates that he makes the offer in spite of her minor social position and her ignorant family. Elizabeth's previously established prejudice against Darcy is intensified and she does not even consider marrying such an arrogant man. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being too proud, while Elizabeth accuses him of being prejudiced, but the truth is that both characters are guilty of pride and prejudice.<br />  The ages for which this book would be appropriate are ages thirteen and up because it gives a good lesson on what life was like in the early nineteenth century. For example, women can't inherit their own estate; only men can.<br />  One literary device that I appreciate is Satire. The author satirizes the manners of all classes, exposing people who have excessive pride as rude and often foolish, regardless of wealth.<br />  I like this book because in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century. Its message is that love is more important than financial gain.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This show is remarkable, simply remarkable. I saw this show a month ago in NYC and have been waiting for the CD ever since. It's one of the most amazing shows I've ever seen, and everything about it is phenomenal. The story is intriguing, it's exciting, it's captivating, it's dark, it's hilarious, it's sad, and it's smart, very smart. The acting and depth and breadth of the characters is so good it makes you forget you're in the theater, you get invested in these people. And Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, I've never seen them in anything else, but I think they're some of the most talented performers I've ever seen in anything. That sounds weird, but they're just sincere and believable with their roles and blow you away. That's good theater for you!!! <br />I know we're talkin about a CD here though. Quite a bit, not all though, of the above comes through on the CD, even though, understandably, that's tough to do on a recording. Well, the score of this show hooked me from the beginning. It's beautiful, catchy, fun, emotional, intelligent, and it gets to you in many ways and on different levels. It's definitely one of my favorite musical scores ever. And can those girls sing or WHAT? They're here in their full glory. I can't even recommend a song, they're ALL great, but off the top of my head &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; , &quot;For Good&quot;, &quot;Thank Goodness&quot;, &quot;What is this Feeling?&quot;,  wow, there are too many. It's a fine, fine CD. It might be confusing for people though, because it doesn't have a summary (major huge spoilers in the show, that's why), and you won't have a clue what's going on otherwise, but I suppose that's OK. <br />It's cliche, but this show makes you laugh till you cry, it breaks your heart till it hurts, and it makes you think. It really makes you think. I'm never gonna be able to watch &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; the same way again.

I can only hope Buble will release another disc soon. He deserves the accolades he's being given all over the world for the respect he shows doing these songs and for introducing them to a generation that will love them to. <br />Bravo!

0385504209|4.0|El libro est&aacute; dise&ntilde;ado, escrito y editado sin otro inter&eacute;s que el de convertirlo en pel&iacute;cula. Es casi un screenplay y sus cortos cap&iacute;tulos no son m&aacute;s que las escenas pre-editadas de una pel&iacute;cula. Dicho esto, el libro es bastante divertido y se puede disfrutar ampliamente siempre que el lector no sea un &quot;fan&quot; del Opus Dei o tome muy a pecho el nuevo testamento. La interpretaci&oacute;n que Brown hace del Santo Grial no es nueva y el hilo que une todos los elementos del libro es bastante d&eacute;bil desde el punto de vista de congruencia historica. El final es desastrozo y falto de imaginaci&oacute;n. La conclusi&oacute;n final es que, este es un libro interesante que se disfruta leyendo, aunque no aporta mucho.
0156027321|4.0|Part Job, part Gulliver, part Robinson Crusoe, but always uniquely himself, Pi Patel embodies the tenacity of the human spirit. Like Job, he suffers terribly and questions God, but ultimately retains his faith. Like Gulliver, he is carried over unknown waters and discovers a mysterious island. Like Crusoe, he uses his wits to survive. The tiger, Richard Parker, is a wonderful companion, both mortal threat and a catalyst for strategies that help preserve Pi's life. As an avatar of fortune, Richard Parker is difficult and unpredictable, but capable of being accommodated, often complacent, and, ultimately, a necessary companion - as well as a fiercely beautiful one. Pi's encyclopedic knowledge of zoology and animal behavior are fascinating and his arguments in favor of zoos are eloquent. His willingness to be graphic about the necessity of killing is both essential for the story and admirable for a sensitive vegetarian. Despite these realities, the story has a lightness of tone that, along with periodic humor, keeps it afloat much as the lifeboat sustains Pi and Richard Parker. At times the narrative moves in a rather perfunctory manner from one incident to another, and for such an intelligent narrator, the writing style occasionally flags (\\"The flash of lightning was incredibly vivid.\\") Perhaps the struggle to stay alive is best served by plain language. I also wanted more theological speculation, more of Pi's inner life during his long ordeal, in addition to the abundance of well-described acts and events. And the blind encounter with a second lifeboat strains the credulity otherwise so well maintained. Despite its flaws, Life of Pi is a moving, imaginative novel. It won't change your life, as some have claimed, but it's well worth reading.
B000002UAC|5.0|Obviously modelled on the first album [compare the opening and closing songs of each], With The Beatles begins with a bang and contains some excellent songs, but also a few duds. The opener, It Won't Be Long, has a great Lennon vocal, and a subtle countermelody. But Don't Bother Me is only interesting because it is the first recorded Harrison song [if you exclude the terrific McCartney-Harrison instrumental Cry For A Shadow]. I Wanna Be Your Man has vitality, but not much else.<br />Hold Me Tight is more interesting, and features an unusual chord progression, but in places it sounds a bit out of tune! Not Paul's best vocal effort. But all is forgiven with the acoustic, tender version of Meredith Willson's Till There Was You. Paul's vocal is terrific, as is the subtle arrangement and guitar solo.<br />All My Loving contains the first of many interesting McCartney bass lines.<br />This album contains more great covers, including Smokey Robinson's You Really Got A Hold On Me. I never tire of listening to the raw singing in 4ths!<br />George Harrison gives us a stirring version of Chuck Berry's Roll Over Beethoven, rivalling its creator's own original.<br />Please Mister Postman and Money give us John at his raucous best.<br />Highly recommended
B00005JKJA|5.0|A mind-blowing film experience that is Lynch's masterpiece. If you aren't into artistic movies that make you think...and that require multiple viewings...then this isn't for you.
0688163173|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I wont give you the plot because a lot of other people have already done so. Simply put its a great book about reality and fantasy. How all of us use fantasy to hide our inner-pain and also our true selves. The characters, the dialogue, the plot,the end. All top-notch. In my opinion its not as good as &quot;Mystic River&quot; but I think its because it really fit my taste in books. But this is also another great novel and I cant wait for his next book. On a final note I  did feel thislike &quot;Mystic River&quot; transcended genres and becomes a piece of literature.
0385504209|4.0|This was a good read and held my interest throughout, but a far better book in this genre is THE LAST DAY (Warner Books), which is also fact-based fiction, but far more harrowing and weighty in subject matter.  It's been out for several years and was a cult hit before the millennium, still strikes at the truth today.  If you liked DaVINCI, LAST DAY is even more fascinating.
B00003CXAE|5.0|Travolta is one of those rare leading men who outshines everyone around him.  Here he is at the peak of his sexual energy unleashing all the moves that made him such a big hit in the 70's.  Olivia Newton John looks pale by comparison, even though it was the height of her career as well.<br />The movie bounces along on a fantastic soundtrack with wonderful sequences that leaving you smiling all the way through the movie.  Some memorable supporting roles such as Jeff Conaway (from Taxi), Stockard Channing, Joan Blondell, Alice Ghostly and many more, but Travolta remains front and center exhibiting a charm and vitality, tearing up the dancefloor when it comes time for him to do so.  The screen is filled with energy in each and every scene making for a riotous good time.
B000069HKH|5.0|I have nothing against Norah Jones but her fine cd was not in the same class as &quot;The Rising.&quot;  Bruce dared to take on a subject that was like a 600 pound Gorilla in America and write honestly about it from many different viewpoints.  Name one other artist that has that kind of courage.  You can't because no one else did it.  His voice has never been better and from the opening drive of &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; to the final plea for the country to RISE UP above the primitive ignorance and lack of tolerance of the world Mr. Springsteen presents us with a poetic, stirring saga that will last well into the next century as an artistic representation of these hard and tragic years in our history.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I heard this CD and I was taken back. I bought the cd prior to this one with the hit One of those days and I was really disappointed by it. This CD renewed my faith in Whitney. I'm glad to see the ol girl hasn't lost her pipes.
B00005JMCN|4.0|In the Depression-Era, America was a lost land, swallowed by depression and poverty, but citizens found a hero in an unlikely place, an awkward race horse named Seabiscuit, who, along with a few flawed men, raced into the winner's circle and people's hearts. Tobey Maguire (&quot;Spider-Man&quot;), Chris Cooper (&quot;Adaptation.&quot;), Jeff Bridges (&quot;K-Pax&quot;), and William H. Macy (&quot;Magnolia&quot;) all star in old-fashioned filmmaker Gary Ross' (&quot;Pleasantville&quot;) winning drama, &quot;Seabiscuit,&quot; which is now available on DVD.<br />Complete with PBS-esque narration, a beautiful Randy Newman score, and a set of ace performances, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is a family film with enough horses to please little girls, enough heart to please the boys, and is so well-made even the hardened adult film geek will find themselves with a lump in their throat and tears in their eyes. &quot;Seabiscuit,&quot; though running a tad long, is a film that you can watch again and again and always cheer as the horse who could captures a lost nation's imagination and hearts!
B0000AQS6R|1.0|How this DVD qualifies as a &quot;special edition,&quot; I have no idea.  The &quot;special features&quot; include one audio commentary, the theatrical trailer and a non-interactive list of the cast and crew.  That's it.<br />Sure, it's the first widescreen edition of this movie on DVD, but it's matted widescreen, which means that although we are seeing what the director intended us to see, it's also less picture than the fullscreen version.  It was shot in 1:85-1 ratio anyway, so it's not a big deal.<br />The audio commentary is absolutely awful - the worst one I've ever heard.  For one, it's got way too many people on it... six, to be exact.  None of whom are Chevy Chase.  Watching the commentary is like watching the movie with a bunch of old ladies, as the actors constantly interrupt each other, repeat each other, try to remember the names of bit-part actors, start thoughts and don't complete them, and obsess about how they look onscreen.  I truly felt sorry for Johnny Galecki (Rusty Griswold), who's mostly silent except when the women prod him with stupid questions, like did he get to kiss Juliette Lewis (the answer is no).<br />Even the DVD case is generic - the old-style paper case with the black plastic tab to close it.  Everything about this DVD screams &quot;ripoff.&quot;<br />Still, I suppose I'm glad to have it, since it replaces a fuzzy VHS tape that I found in the hallway of the apartment I stayed in during college.  I still laughed out loud at the movie about a dozen times, even though I've seen it at least 50 times.
0679428895|3.0|Pompeii does not quite live up to the standards of Robert Harris's previous work. Perhaps as a consequence of the story's era, Harris spends a lot more time in scene setting. Day to day routine needed little elaboration in Enigma, nor really in Fatherland, given that the settings of those stories were relatively close to contemporary life. Much of this historical scenery is interesting, and Harris's detailed research does come through with a commanding grasp of the facts. The price the reader pays is that it also clutters up some of the character development. <br />Where history and action combine (executing a slave by feeding him to the eels, for instance) the writing achieves and perhaps even exceeds the class and pace of some of Harris's earlier work. Parts of the text drag, however, as the need to explain context competes with the need for the story to move forwards. The corruption plot comes through a little clumsily at times, as well. <br />Overall this is by no means a bad book - for holiday reading it is great. It is just not quite the compelling page-turner Enigma was.
0553213105|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.<br /> The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.<br /> Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.<br /> I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|I was a huge, huge Pearl Jam fan from 1992 to 1996ish.  They were my favorite band at the time.  I saw them in 1994 in Rochester, NY with Mudhoney on the Vs. tour for like $12.  I spent hundreds of dollars on bootlegs.  Then No Code came out.  I gave it a few listens, but I could not get into it.  And after they didn't tour during my college years, I kind of forgot about Pearl Jam.  I don't own any album after No Code.<br />Then I heard about this album.  It interested me because I was familar with songs like Wash, Alone, Dirty Frank, and Footsteps from my fanatic days.  And with such an inexpensive price, I figured, \\"Why Not?\\".  Well, I am very glad I bought this disk.  It flat out rocks.  It reminded me why I used to think Pearl Jam was the greatest band in the world.  There are some duds (all the songs not sung by Eddie plus a couple others), but only a couple duds on a double album of b-sides is incredible.  And the strength of the later b-sides has peaked my interest in the post-No Code albums.<br />I do wish a couple more of the older rarities were included (they have all been mentioned) and I wish there were some songs from the Vitalogy era, but overall a very good collection.  I recommend this to all former hardcore fans that may have lost interest the last several years.
B000002QWD|5.0|This is a retitled version of Bing Crosby's classic album [[ASIN:B000FWI8Q6 Merry Christmas]].  The songs are in a different order than on the original release, for some reason.  But whatever order the songs are in, they are all classics.  It doesn't get much better around Christmas time than hearing Der Bingle sing \\"Silent Night\\", \\"Adeste Fideles\\" and \\"White Christmas\\".  The CD also includes three duets with the legendary Andrews Sisters, and one duet with the forgotten Carole Richards.  One thing I have to question is the inclusion of \\"Faith of Our Fathers\\".  It's a good song, but it's not a Christmas song.  Regardless of that, I highly recommend this CD.
B0000039QA|5.0|Life After Death is the much anticipated follow-up to Biggie's ground breaking Ready to Die album.  Biggie proves on here why he earned the label king of Brooklyn.  It consists of two discs both of which are very strong. <br /> <br />Disc 1 <br />Starts out with intro song Puff is in the Hospital with BIG right before he dies. Somebody's Got to Die is a story about BIG and his crew going after someone.  With Biggie's great story telling style you almost can follow him along in this one as he moves from event to event.  Hyptnotize, instant club song and good for parties.  The next song depicts the only weakness about this album, and that is the long intro's before many of the songs.  These intros are usually voice recordings or pointless talking and can only be fast forward through so you cannot just skip them.  The song however, is very good.  Other highlights include, Last Day, Mo Money Mo Problems, and Niggaz Bleed.  I think Niggaz Bleed is my favorite cut on this disc.  Once again you feel like your almost with Biggie when he tells the tale.   <br /> <br />Disc 2 <br />Starts out with the classic Notorious Thugz, a collaboration with BIG and Bone Thugz.  He adopts there quick ryhming style and fits in perfectly on here, although the song does get a bit long.  Miss You and SKy's the Limit are both classic very heart felt songs.  They bring a positive demension to this album, which is missing from a lot of rap albums these days.  Going Back to Cali is probably my favorite song, the beat is really good and Biggie gives praise to Cali, despite all the negative things people were saying about him and Cali.  Nasty Boy has a good beat and is basically about Biggie and Sex, the intro to this song is actually pretty funny and the only one I would have kept on here (besides the intro track on disc 1).  Playa Hata is one of the worst songs I have ever heard and The World is Filled is also a weak song, but other than that all the other ones are really good.  I love the last3 songs, although puffys screaming on them doesnt really add much.  the last two songs are probably my favorite, Long Kiss has a great beat and Your Nobody really is a great way to end the album.  Its a bit eriee too because shortly before this album was released biggie was gunned down and was killed.   <br /> <br />This is a classic album and BIG shows why he has been labeled as one of the greatest rappers of all time.  Sadly this was his last offical album and the 2 that have followed this one are more or less just past lyrics with new beats.  But these songs are all orginal and make for one of the greatest double disc experiences you can get.  Cop it quickly
B00008EYA5|5.0|I liked the Tv show, And when This came out in theaters I knew I needed to see it. And I wasn't dissapointed, It is action packed and it has great chemistry between the characters. [...]
B00008CLOA|5.0|If you are a fan, and have a good 5.1 system - buy this.  It sounds as good (and brings back the feeling) of listening to the original album.
B00006CXXU|4.0|When Christina Aguilera took a break to re-establish herself as a person and recording artist, something must've clicked and made her fully aware of just how important her sophmore studio record would be. The album had to be everything her eponymous debut was not - authentic, fresh and unpolished. Much to my surprise, 'Stripped' was exactly that.<br />Unlike her pop contemporaries (Spears, Simpson) who'd much rather opt to craft an album filled with radio-friendly pop tunes, seemingly forgettable by years end, Aguilera decided to create an album of personal depth, exuding self-confidence (\\"Beautiful\\"), vulnerability (\\"I'm OK\\"), sexuality (\\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\"), anger (\\"Fighter\\") and female-empowerment (\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\") on an eclectic batch of tracks.<br />'Stripped' is not a masterpiece, and like every album that is not, it has its flaws. But for what the album lacks, it more than makes up for with Aguilera's powerhouse vocals and cleverly written empowering anthems. No doubt about it, an album of this caliber deserves to be celebrated and acknowledged for years to come. Aguilera has grown as a woman and an artist, and through her work, it shows.
B0000CFW87|5.0|&quot;but there remains a nagging sense here that he hasn't truly pushed himself as an artist--yet. --Jerry McCulley&quot;<br />I sometimes think that reviewers need to find something wrong.  I disagree wholeheartedly with Jerry.  I don't know if this is better than his first album, and maybe because it's new - but I find the music compelling, mezmorizing and simply stunning.  Per Te - just beautiful, really there isn't one song I don't like.  And, I really didn't care for Starry Starry Night on the first album (however it grew on me.)<br />I generally don't gush like this and I've never written an online review before, but just had to share my opinion.
7119005901|5.0|This is definitely good book for people who want to learn history of china and from this book, you can also find some very helpful information and methods in your daily life. You should not only read this book but also you should keep a copy of it on you desk.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|This generous compilation is a great pick-up for anyone who is remotely a fan of Pearl Jam. I can't recall any other band releasing a whole double CD set of b-sides and for that the band must be congratulated, since it makes this package great value for fans. Most of the material is very strong as well and only serves to enhance the stature of this band. The only problem with a collection as thorough as this is that it is effectively a bit of a slap in the face to die-hard fans who have spent their hard-earned money tracking down deleted singles, compilations, fan club releases etc. I am not one of those people in the case of Pearl Jam so it's great to have all of this stuff in one place but I sympathise with those who own all the singles, some of which are now rendered a bit pointless i guess. I hope the bands whose b-sides I have personally collected aren't as generous as Pearl Jam in the future!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Ive already seen the shows twice and will definately see it again!! Stephen Schwartz has outdone himself with this one. Kristen Chenoweth and Idina Menzel are sure canidates for the TONY with this one, the problem is who should win it? they are equally as good. Norbet Leo Butz makes the perfect fiyero and is vocally superb. The score is just wonderful and you leave the theatre singing most of the tunes.
B000099T2L|2.0|When it was worldly reported that Beyonce Knowles was going to release her &quot;first&quot; solo album, I know I wasn't the only who thought, &quot;First? Wait, isn't this her fourth?&quot; Let's face it, the unnaturally-blonde R&amp;B diva-in-training was not only the lead singer, but the backbone behind the multi-platinum selling group she emerged from. <br />'Dangerously In Love', stamped as her &quot;solo debut album,&quot; stems from a collective batch of urban styles, but fails to impress. Beyonce, clearly lacking soul and inventing a new supersonic scream, as if she were Siryn in the latest X-Men film, teased listeners early on with her two upbeat, infectious #1 singles, &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy,&quot; leading them on to believe there was more where those came from. Unfortunately, after the album's first three tracks, it progressively gets worse and worse...and worse, leaving you with a bunch of dull, psuedo-R&amp;B tunes and wannabe-soul duds.<br />In the end, the album has no substance. It's an album unworthy of Knowles' true talent. When she isn't singing, she's screaming. When she isn't screaming, she's reciting trite, cliche lyrical content. When the hype is gone, could 'Dangerously In Love' stand up on its own? I don't believe so.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|Marvelous, Simply Marvelous. Watching Henry Fonda in this movie blew me away when I saw it years ago. I realized then what a great actor can do with a role that go against any type casting from previous film roles. Viewing it again in the DVD format is stunning. Sergio Leone is in my Hall of Fame as a movie director.<BR>You can easily see Sergio Leone influence in all of Clint Eastwood work. This is a must see movie for all us old cowboy movie fans.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|The latest incarnation of rock has arrived.  'JET' is old school rock-n-roll with a new edge.  This band embodies all that rock-n-roll stands for.  'Get Born,' their major label debut is a solid listen that will ring in your earholes for months.  It has not left my CD player since I purchased it.  This album has it all, in your face rock-n-roll attacks, and thoughtful acoustic numbers, but never a dull moment.  'Get Born' should be purchased by everyone who is reading this.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|Here's my review of this album..track by track:<BR>1- Bang Bang : This song is wonderful..too bad the soundtrack has only an instrumental version (or is only my CD?)..the sample on amazon.com is the real song .. however on my CD there's no Nancy Sinatra's voice to be heard..can any one clarify this for me please?<BR>2- That certain Female : A cheesy rock'n'roll song ..personally i didn't like it<BR>3- The Grand Duel : Now that's symphonic beauty..<BR>4- Twisted Nerve : Cool voice whistling..actually it really made me nervous in the movie !!<BR>5- Queen of the Crime Council : Quoted from the movie - Oren Ishii's speech.. <BR>6- Ode to O-ren Ishii : Nice Rap song by the great RZA.<BR>7- Run Fay Run : What else did you expect? Another Isaac Hayes classic...gave me an old feeling like iam watching a Bruce Lee movie or something..<BR>8- Green Hornet : I simply love this song..<BR>9- Battle without honor or humanity : not of my favorites..<BR>10- Don't Let me be Misunderstood : ohyaaa..Flamengo..makes me dance..this is the longest track on the album.I liked the instrumental version in the movie better though..it was a great scene.<BR>11-Woo Hoo : hmmm..we're not in the 70's anymore..<BR>12-Crane: I skip through this one..<BR>13-Flower of Carnage: I don't understand a word in japanese still i LOVE this song..it's just wonderful..<BR>14-The Lonely Shepard: What can i say? A classic masterpiece that I enjoyed since my childhood..i bought the album because of this track..and the japanese touch in the end is great.This is the real end of the album for me..whatever comes next is just soundeffects..  <BR>15-You're My Qicked Life: Another quote from the movie..&quot;I want him to know..I want them all to know&quot;..<BR>16-Ironside: The look on her face when she remembers..very alarming..<BR>17 to 22 : Soundeffects that add no real value to the album.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Are you as sick as I am of having to skip to the good songs you rememberfrom the movie on a soundtrack?  Then buy this one, immediately!  I loved the whole thing, I even kind of liked the movie-music track towards the end (glasgow love theme).  I didn't skip over one single track, and played a couple of them twice (joni mitchell!)  Great for christmas too!
B00000JLWW|5.0|Music was astounding. I loved the music. It was so beautiful. It got stuck in my head for months. The acting was good with Leonardo and Winslet. They played their parts really good. The movie was very good. The special effects and atmosphere were great. I loved it and i'm going to buy the soundtrack.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought the Firefly DVD on the reco of friends.  Quite simply this is the best TV science fiction series I've ever seen.  It presents a realistic and interesting vision of the far future.  The special effects are very good for a television series and the stories are well designed and written.  As a big science fiction fan I strongly recommend this DVD.

0790729628|1.0|As soon as I discovered the film had been &quot;Formatted to fit&quot; my<br />TV screen I knew I had bought the wrong DVD.<br />I absolutely detest &quot;Pan &amp; Scan&quot; versions of wide screen movies.<br />This is a great way to destroy an excellent film which is exactly<br />what has happened in this case.<br />Don`t waste your hard earned money on this piss poor product.
B00008DDXC|2.0|The movie is nothing like the book. The movie is a horrible joke. It wasn't funny if thats what their getting at. The book was actually enjoyable but the movie didn't follow the book that well. The acting was stupid. They were the worst actors ever. Don't buy or see this movie it will be a waste of your money. The special effects were also a bad joke.
B00006L83N|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect from this band, but picked this album up after reading the reviews. I have been a fan of Dream Theater for a long time, and saw plenty of statements comparing the two bands, so I figured if I liked one, I would probably like the other.<br />After listening to this album a couple of times, I see now why people make the comparison. There's heavy guitar work, there's heavy, crushing drumming, and keyboards. However, that's really where the similarities stop. It would almost be like claiming that since two bands have singers and guitarists, they must be alike. So far from the truth.<br />The first thing I would like to point out about this album is that the production is absolutely stunning. I played it on the system in my living room and it was almost like I was in the recording studio. The guitars and drums, especially, are reproduced with lifelike accuracy. The liner notes mention that this was recorded in the &quot;Symphony X Dungeon&quot; .. well, whatever dungeon that is, they have some stellar equipment in there and guys that know how to put it all to use.<br />Now, as to the music. Russell Allen has an amazing voice and it really stands out here. Romeo's guitar playing is blistering, crushing and amazing technically. There were several times that I could not believe that just one man was responsible for the guitar playing heard here. Rullo's drumming is absolutely phenomenal, and his kick bass work extremely accurate. He and Romeo blend together perfectly in many songs, with tight, well rehearsed, technically difficult performances. The keyboarding and bass playing is also technically excellent, which rounds out the entire sound of the band.<br />This album is flat out awesome. Get it, now.
B00006CYAD|5.0|I don't have words to describe this cd. I think it's the best ever in it's genre and the other bands should put themselves on their knees to praise this guys. If you don't buy this CD, you should die buying latest Justin Timberlake's CD
B00000269G|5.0|Yes the recording is dated and substandard but this is truly an amazing  performance by a master pianist that deserves a place in every serious jazz afficianado's library.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|Each track on this handy compilation embodies all of the genuine elements that made Kansas one of the all-time greats, consisting of the Topeka-homegrown innocence (without the cliched naivety) combined with weary-eyed looks at the past, present, and an uncertain future. Springing from the virtuous, innocent American heartland, Kansas was a band that remained honest in their hopeful-sad-determined subject matter, and became one of the premier supergroups of its time (and remaining unmatched in their genre to this day). They proved they could pull off their love of British progressive rock without sounding overblown or overproduced, while keeping an authentic Southern jam essence. This slightly made-over version of the original release showcases examples of the things that made Kansas stand out; whether it's the doleful realizations of 'Dust in the Wind,' the power of 'Point Of Know Return' or 'Carry on Wayward Son,' or reflections of Kerry Livgren's search for redemption through Christianity, every song here remains some of the best work released during their respective times. However, it should be noted that &quot;The Best Of Kansas&quot; is not necessarily a place to start for new fans; rather, Kansas is one of those bands whose immense creativity is best experienced with each individual album, and no compilation completely does them a significant amount of justice. Nonetheless, it's still a relatively sturdy overview, and a fascinating musical biography.
B000000OXH|4.0|Asia's 2nd cd, is nearly as good as the 1st.  Were the debut cd, every song was great, here on this one, there are a couple that are below average, NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS &amp; LAST TO KNOW.  Other than that, this is a great cd, with some really great songs.  DON'T CRY, THE HEAT GOES ON, &amp; TRUE COLORS, sound as if they were pulled off the first cd, which is not a bad thing.  THE SMILE HAS LEFT YOUR EYES, is another great song, almost a &quot;big balad&quot; song before there were big balads.  All the members again do a great job, altough, the keyboards seem to be more up front this time, but guitaist Steve Howe, still does a great job. A great second cd.
B00004XONN|5.0|I was at first shocked that I was listening to music like this. But soon I really appreciated the beauty and sadness of this album. Its message is not the most uplifting but for some reason it does carry hope (which I felt after listening to the last song...I was speechless at that point). This is not a very accessible album, but it does have appeal for those who want to feel something from listening to music (whether it is positive or negative). I for one, felt something positive from it. This is not for the musically faint.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|This is a catchy record.  It helps that iPod commercials made the song familiar to me. But there are SO many familiar rock sounds in this album. I'm hearing Iggy Pop and AC/DC all the time in the tunes and riffs. The ballads even seem familiar.  I suppose you could treat this album as a tribute to old school rock.  It is actually nice to hear this sound without having to switch to the classic rock station and hear the same old songs.  Good straght ahead old edgy rock.

B00006LLNU|4.0|I heard Sigur ros and their album ( ) for the first time about 3 weeks ago, when a colleague of mine, who is a big fan, let me listen to his. Once I learned they were from Iceland I was curious to listen because the only other Icelandic musicians that I'm familiar with are Bjork and the instrumentalist Snorri. These comprise a very interesting cocktail of original talent coming from the small island in the North Atlantic. And they span quite a spectrum, musically speaking. Since I'm so new to Sigur ros I'm still in the dark about many things regarding them. Some of my questions have been answered in the below customer reviews - for instance what they're (or are not) singing about. I thought they sung in Icelandic, and considering the number of international fans they have, I found this rather odd. I have been set straight by the reviews on this page. Now I regard the singing more like an additional instrument and find it works well. I have also listened to two of their earlier CDs and while detecting striking Pink Floydish influence, their music is also somewhat reminiscent of the band Low (which many call slow because of their slow music). The album ( ) is definitely worth it, however, the music doesn't show a lot of change from their previous work. I am sure many of their other fans prefer this, but I personally prefer more variability.  Appreciating their originality and soothing melodic sound, I certainly recommend the CD ( ), but the similarity to their previous work is a drawback for me. Of the three aforementioned Icelanders, I find Sigur ros more talented than Bjork, although Bjork is more orginal. However, I find the more melodic beauty in Snorri's music.
B000069AUI|5.0|At first when I heard songs from Coldplay's Parachutes I really saw talent, but I wasn't that much impressed. After that I thought the hype was totally undeserved...But this album proved how wrong I was. I was caught into the songs that made me feel not only the emotions behind the words in the song but also the harmonious instruments. It was definitely one of the best albums of 2002. &quot;Clocks&quot; and &quot;The Scientist&quot; are definite reasons to look into this album if you already haven't. I really recommend it.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I don't think that this DVD is only for Daft Punk fans. It's brilliant from beginning to end, and the director, Leiji Matsumoto, has magnificently choreographed the already fabulous Discovery album, and created a visual masterpiece. The film will appeal to anime fans too, and if, like I, you are an anime and Daft Punk fan; &quot;Interstella 555&quot; is the purchase of the year.<br />This is inspiring work from one of the greatest anime director's in collaboration with THE greatest Disco house group on the planet, and for that matter, the music from &quot;Discovery&quot; (aka Interstella 555 without visuals)is pioneering in it's effect on the Dance music scene around the world!<br />I'm expecting this to be played on screens around bars in London.<br />Buy the DVD!
B00008J4P5|2.0|These guys are doing nothing new, and Jack's vocals really do NOT sound anything like some previous comparisons to Robert Plant. 'Theres no home for you here girl' has near enough the same riff as 'Dead Leaves'<BR>Conclusion - if you think this rocks, get educated and by some Zepp, Stones, Beatles
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM. MAYNARD AND BILLY BOTH KNOW WHAT TRUE ART IS AND NEVER OVERSTATE THEIR ART.  I LOVE VANISHING, WEAK AND POWERLESS, THE NOOSE AND THE OUTSIDER, BUT I HATE CRIMES AND LULLABYE, WHICH I THINK SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT OFF THE ALBUM.  BETTER THAN ANYTHING ON THE CHARTS AT THE MOMENT.  I'M DISAPPOINTED THIS WAS NOT SUCH A BIG HIT COZ IT DESERVES TO BE.  COME ON GET BUYING!!!!!

B000003S09|5.0|When this little album came out in 1969, the feel-good era of the 60's was in its death throes. People began to realize that attending concerts in the nude and doing copious amounts of drugs were not activities that would usher in a new age of harmony, and there is perhaps no album that captures that disillusionment quite as perfectly as ITCOTKC. The album kicks off with a scathing indictment of those in power, called &quot;20th Century Schizoid Man&quot;. With grossly distorted vocals, lyrics about paranoia and innocents being ravaged by napalm, and a mind-bogglingly complex jazzy middle section, this song pretty much divides the listeners into those who can and those who can't stomach the journey that lies ahead. Turn on the news while playing this song, and notice that it is more relevant than ever. In contrast to &quot;20th Century&quot; is the second song, the gentle, flute-dominated &quot;I Talk To The Wind&quot;, which is about as 60-ish as this band ever got. Even so, there is something not right about lyrics such as &quot;I Talk To The Wind, the wind does not hear- the wind cannot hear&quot;. The third song, &quot;Epitaph&quot;, is a VERY mournful song about the fate of mankind being steered off course by evil fools and their instruments of death. One can only hope that Greg Lake is not being prophetic when he sings, &quot;If we make it, we can all sit back and laugh-but I fear that tomorrow I'll be crying&quot;. A very dramatic song full of swells, acoustic guitars, mellotrons, and an angelic voice that conveys confusion and devastation. The fourth song, the oft-maligned &quot;Moonchild&quot;, consists of two minutes worth of spooky music (made even more eerie by the fact that a Moonchild is a creature created by magical means, as mentioned in the works of Aleister Crowley), with a pleasant melody by Lake. What many people seem to hate are the several minutes of tinkering and improvisation that follow, some of it creepy sounding, some of it minimalistic and pointless. Either way, a bold idea, especially from a bunch of guys that are anything but musically inept. The last, &quot;In The Court of the Crimson King&quot;, from which the band got its name, is a majestic sounding song, sort of in the vein of &quot;Epitaph&quot;, but a little less sad. The lyrics seem to describe the entourage of some demon lord or something, and the lyrics address such pleasant things as jesters, fire witches, and grinding wheels. All in all, this album is a work of genius, which the band never really surpassed. If you're looking for a piece of darkness from the late 60's, this might be the disc for you.
0316776963|5.0|I haven't read something this funny in recent memory. Through all the essays in the book, Sedaris talks about his world from a completely outside view, like he's been stuck here in a vaguely mean-spirited joke. He does this in the first part of the book explaining the equally bizzare worlds of his education, his family and his art. In the second half of the book, telling the story of living in France, the outsider-ness is magnified. It is hysterical. <br />Any time he tries to explain Americans, he does with this strange combination of ownership and disdain. Sort of like someone telling stories about the family screw-up. It's no problem for one of them to call Uncle Joe a loser, but heavan forbid one of us does. In aspects like that, its clear he's not writing comedy exactly. He's got some warmth for his subjects, some love for it all. And he's trying to figure himself out, trying to make sense of everything. I think its that aspect, the solidity of his observations, that makes this a really interesting book. Which is not to say I wasn't laughing out loud, tears in my eyes reading about the Pickapocketioni on the Paris Metro.

B00005ASHM|5.0|Look, people very infrequently think of the popular song format as a an art form, but it is so in every way that sonata allegro form is to symphonic music.  Even Michael Franks recognized this and got a Ph.D. studying the form, and it's influenence on moderm music.<br />That said, the songs on Pet Sounds rank among the very best realizations of the popular song format ever recorded.  Other examples are, of course, the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, Steely Dan.  The songs represented here were an attempt (probably not entirely successful) of Brian Wilson to break out of a formula that had proven successful for several years.  The band and others resented him for it, but he proved that this was not to be formulaic music.  From a musicological perspective, this was a very personal and inspired work.<br />Others who claim that it was slick or reflective of California tastes are right to a degree, but are missing the point that the popular song idiom incorporates hooks and structures that are requisite elements of the idiom.  The artists of the medium omit them at their peril.  Until Rubber Soul and well after, the Beatles had little profundity in their music, but had honed their facility with the idiom to a huge degree.  Pet Sounds played a similar role for the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.<BR>Cheers

0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins and his team of researchers chose the only 11 companies who went from good to great - NOT companies that have always been great or that have been great for only a short period of time. After extensive debate about what these 11 companies have in common, Collins and his team conclude that:<br />ALL of these companies' leaders are uncharismatic and humble.<BR>The leaders of these companies take on the right people and get rid of the wrong people before they take the right action.<br />The ideas continue to make sense but are contrary to what we've been taught: that big egos with great ideas make great companies. <br />What's most interesting is that while the ideas that came out of this research make sense, only 11 companies - all strategically chosen - made the cut.<br />What does this book teach us? That there's a fairly straightforward recipe that Boards of Directors and CEOs do have the power to create. Very few companies have followed this model, but those that have have become their industry leaders over time.<br />Businesses are lucky to have this research accessible. The results are straightforward, to the point, and well written.

1400034779|5.0|Some books get to the No.1 slot on Amazon - this is one that OUGHT to get there - if enough of you buy  10 copies each to give to all your friends and family this Christmas, it is in with a chance - No.91 on the list is simply far too low. Mma Ramotswe and the other many equally delightful people of Botswana that McCall Smith  has created in this simply idyllic series (even Laura Bush loves the series I gather), is the perfect enjoyable, innocent, heroic, gentle and always hilariously funny reading that everyone needs in these deeply troubled times. This is THE perfect Christmas present for just about everyone in the family - my wife and I are ladelling out copies like sweets this year - and each one will give a lifetime of fun. Not only that but success and fame could not have happened to a nicer person  than McCall Smith himself - he is simply one of the nicest, kindest and most consistently hysterically funny authors you will ever meet, and booksellers world wide are now eagerly awaiting his next novels in the Botswana series, to pack out their stores and to have an author evening like no other. This is magical stuff, folks - make us all happy, buy 10 copies each to introduce them to friends and family, buy 10 boxes of the boxed set each for those who will enjoy all of them and get this most deserving of authors to Amazon No.1 by Christmas.

0804106304|4.0|What man among us has not at one point or another said that they did not understand a woman?  What home grown American can honestly say they know what it is like to be an immigrant?  How many of us know what real tragedy is?  In fact, most of us live in comfortable circumstances.  We live in warm homes, in well fed families.  Sure, we all have inter-family tension, but few of us can imagine what is like to be a woman who has come from another, very foreign, country.  We would have a hard time imagining what hopes she would try to bring to her offspring, and how she would live her own life.  In fact, even if we did meet someone with these experiences, or read their memoirs, we would have a hard time relating to their often one-dimensional story.  Here, Amy Tan, author of The Joy Luck Club, succeeded by not only putting us in the position of a single person with these amazing experiences, we have a multitude of points of views from many different women.  <BR>These women who immigrated from China, Suyan Woo, An-mei Hsu, Lindo Jong, and Yin-ying St. Clair, all have unique stories to tell.  Not only this, but we also get to hear from their daughters.  This presents an excellent means of having us relate to the Chinese ways of thinking.  As the daughters think as Americans, but are brought up in a Chinese environment and therefore can relate the situations to us and have them make sense.  <BR>Situations that would otherwise seem so foreign to us are made clear with commentary from the daughters.  One of the clearest examples is with Rose Hsu Jordan.  Her mother, An-mei Hsu, tried to bring her up in the American way, strong and free willed.  While An-mei is thinking of her daughter, \\"I was raised in the Chinese way: I was taught to desire nothing, swallow other people's misery, to east my own bitterness.\\" Jordan is thinking, \\"There were too many choices.\\"  In the end, she married and lost herself to her husband Ted who is a Caucasian.  Being what Ted's American set of values were, he then rejected her after years of marriage.  This shows us the intricate relationship between a mother and her daughter, the cultural differences between the American norm and the Chinese norm, and the conflict that can arise from there.  This is a situation most men would never understand to begin with, and Tan eloquently describes, almost as an extension of her own experiences.  <BR>Another situation where we are given a woman's insight into her relationship with her mother is with Jing-Mei Woo and her mother.  Jing-Mei's mother was of the opinion that you could be anything you wanted to be if you tried hard enough.  When Jing-mei was very young, she learned to resent all the pressure placed on her by her mother.  She got to the point where she became sp paranoid of success by trying, that she learned to fail in everything in life from college to love.  She felt everything her mother did was to make her miserable because she could not meet her mother's expectations, not to mention Suyuan Woo's expectations being raised because of the success of one of the other daughters of a Joy Luck club member named Waverley who was a chess prodigy.  In reality, all her mother wanted was the best for her daughter.  Suyuan just did not know the right way to communicate this when she was young and forever scared her daughter.  To be able to look into Jing-mei's troubled life from both her view and her mother' we can piece together a complete picture of what was going through each one of their lives to bring them to that point. <BR>In conclusion, this story portrays so many points of view on how life can be for a woman immigrating into the United States. You are forced to start relating to them in ways that Tan's writing easily makes possible.  To truly understand all the possibilities, you must read the book, and this book is indeed worth reading.
B00005JM02|5.0|All I can say is it is a must have for ANY age - even adults. Kids will watch over and over again! Right from the start the story pulls you in and it's a whirlwind of fun and adventure, meeting lots of unique characters. Lots of humor with Dory (Ellen Degeneres who else!). Kids might get a little scared if they are little but overall a great story of not giving up! Lots of extras on the special dvd version.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Recorded in a blaze of cocaine. Legend has it that DB can't remember recording half of this. From the lyrics, I imagine he probably doesn't want to. This is Plastic Soul to the nth degree. Party music for a crypt. The funk of Golden Years and Stay is machine-like, the soul's been sucked out of soul. A neat trick. TVC15 and the title track's party mood is belied by Bowie's hysterical wailing. Word on a Wing is a desperate cry to God, Wild is the Wind to a lover.<BR>In other words, it's a bit of an odd album. But very good.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I have not read this book but I love the movie. I own it and probably have watched it at least a dozen times. For a movie, it was witty, entertaining, and funny. Most the funny parts are subtle and you have to pay attention. Excellent casting - chemistry between Jeremy Northam and Paltrow.  He is the friend we all wish we had. Someone who can tell you your faults yet love you just the same. I had to pay attention to see EMcgreggor in the movie. <br />Must have in your collection! Great romantic flick!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I couldn't believe my eyes when I read that Firefly was cancelled by Fox.  I looked forward to my Friday nights and they haven't been the same since.  But at least I now have a complete set of all the shows beautifully created on DVD format.  I did tape each of the shows as they were originally broadcast, but we had a power outage one evening in November of 2002 and missed a show.  Now, I not only have that show to watch, but three more that never aired.  <BR>It still baffles me why Fox cancelled the best show they had going.  This was such a fun show to watch, total entertainment.  The casting, stories and writting couldn't have been better. I hope that the rumor of a Full Length Firefly movie is true and I look forward to seeing more from the crew of Serenity.
B0000VCZK2|2.0|The movies in this set are for the most part excellent. Alien, Aliens, and (yes) Alien^3 stand out as masterpieces of the science fiction genre. (It should be noted that the third film was much better received in Europe, where more mature audiences were no doubt able to handle the grim but inescapabley ending to what is essentially a saga of Lovecraftian cosmic horror.) Resurrection will always be a shameless commercial farce, but the special features for the other three films more than make up for this shortcoming. Unfortunately, the value of the films themselves is marred by the flimsiness of the packaging. The foldout is low-quality cardstock that creases and abrades with the slightest use, blemishing the printed surfaces. The plastic inserts are poorly fastened and come loose readily, causing the discs to jostle around inside the sleave and become scratched. Some discs also seem to be faulty, containing glitches that cause them to skip consistently at specific points, making them unwatchable without a remote control handy to fast-forward through damaged segments. Altogether, these problems detract considerably from the viewing experience and make the set as constituted more of a headache than a joy. I was forced to return my first copy for a working replacement and will likely be returning the replacement as well. The individual releases will hopefully be more sturdy and less bug-ridden, and I recommend that anyone considering this item wait instead for those to become available.
B000089RVX|3.0|Evanescence are a band who have done something a little different yet also managed to make it catchy enough for mass appeal, especially now while nu-metal is still as popular as ever despite the apparent stagnation of the scene. The problem is that what they're doing isn't as original as many give it credit for (Gathering or Lacuna Coil anyone?) and (perhaps more importantly) the catchyness is something that wears thin soon.<br />One of my main problems with this album is that it is so mindnumbingly simple in places. Numerous songs, the first two singles Going Under and Bring Me To Life for example, both have repetitive one chord riffs over and over and over. I have no problem with simplicity when it is used to effect, but here it sounds amatuerish considering the fairly thick, deep, mysterious sound that they appear to be trying to capture.<br />Amy Lee may be a good singer (though nothing on Alanis Morisette or Tarja Turunen), but her vocals (no matter how good they may be) are not enough to carry the album by themselves. To be quite frank, the overall talent level of this band is incredibly low. The bass and rythm guitars are so boring that your air guitar will stay firmly on its stand in the corner. The drummer can keep in time (which is a start, I suppose), but fails to do much else. And the few solos that are on this CD are just pathetic in my opinion. Solos don't need to be fast, technical shred-fests that last 2 minutes each to be good, but they need to be more than stagnant random picking with the occasional pinch harmonic thrown in for good measure.<br />That isn't to say that there isn't some good stuff here. I still give it three stars because some of these songs (the singles plus Everybody's Fool and Tourniquet in particular) are very decent with real replayability. However, this psuedo-gothic nu-metal really don't have that much to offer. It isn't terrible, but its far from amazing and if I were you I'd strongly avoid getting suckered in by the hype. If heavy goth type stuff is what you want then get Beyond The Veil by Tristania instead.If heavy goth type stuff is what you want then get Beyond The Veil by Tristania instead.
0060934913|5.0|This is a very engaging, funny, fascinating look at the life of one of New York's most notorious chefs and a world about which he feels ambivalent. If you have ever wondered what its like to live your days and nights in the kitchen of a popular restaurant - buy this book. Mr. Bourdain is certainly profane at times, but its done in the context of that unique, mixed up, chaotic, wonderful world of fire and knives. I loved every word! I want to go out to eat every night now (except seafood on Tuesday - read the book and find out why)! Bon appetit!
B00009RDG9|2.0|This is a film about a soldier called Aaron Hallam (Benicio del Toro) who works for the usual super-elite, super-secret special forces outfit. But he goes off the rails and suddenly here he is in the woods of Oregon killing people with his big knife. At which point the FBI call up L. T. Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones), the man who taught Hallam everything he knows and who is peculiarly skilled and tenacious at conducting manhunts (So not the most original piece of casting of all time then...) <br />The rest of the film is about how neither his old special forces bosses not the cops are anywhere near hard enough to catch and restrain Hallam but Bonham of course is. And, yes, it is as routine and predictable as it sounds. I can imagine this film being quite engaging for adolescent boys (if its makers hadn't foolishly made it too violent to escape an R rating) but for adults it has very little to offer. There's a father-son thing going on between Hallam and Bonham that is enormously contrived and unconvincing and has the feel of something tagged on at the last minute in a failed bid to add a little emotional depth to a film that doesn't have any. It is decently enough acted especially by Jones -though he is surely getting a bit old for this kind of part - and pretty efficiently directed by Friedkin. I just wish he could have found something more interesting to direct.
B000002GYI|5.0|I've always thought of Kraftwerk as a novelty.  Not a band one could listen to on a regular basis or for too long.  I saw the music video for &quot;Pocket Calculator&quot; and thought I'd give them a try as that song is fun and very cool.  Computer World was the first of their albums I purchased and I loved it from the title track to the last.  I've since bought several more of their albums and this is still my favorite.  &quot;Computer Love&quot; is the best track on the album.  It sounds like a love a computer would write, it's marvelous.  The melody is beautiful.  I love the retro electronic sound and the retro computer on the cover (I'm an early '80s kind of person).  I also find Computer World the most accessible of Kraftwerk's &quot;werks,&quot; much more so than their groundbreaking Autobahn which I still cannot get into. If you are looking to try out your first Kraftwerk album, I recommend this one or Trans-Europe Express, as they each have wonderful songs you can actually remember and hum after they've finished.
B000099T2L|1.0|I'm sorry but Beyonce Knowles is a horrible singer. I am so sick of her. This cd was awful. I listened to a friends copy and she told me I could have it. I took the cd and sold it at a used cd store near my school. Her vocals are limited and this is an overly produced effort. Period point blank her singing sucks. Calling her a singer is an insult to all the talented singers out now.
B00000DQSZ|4.0|Trans-Europe Express is right up there with Computer World as Kraftwerk's best &quot;Werk.&quot;  It is far more accessible than their groundbreaking Autobahn in that the tracks are more melodious and memorable.  I find myself humming passages from some of these songs whereas on other Kraftwerk albums I cannot even remember how the tracks go.  &quot;Europe Endless&quot; is a free spirited, fun ride.  I can see myself alone on the autobahn with this 9:35 track in the background.  &quot;The Hall of Mirrors&quot; is a haunting yet gentle song with more lyrics than the usual Kraftwerk number: &quot;Even the greatest stars discover themselves in the looking glass.&quot;  The imagery in &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot; takes the listener to another world; a robotic world.  Alan Parsons could have taken some lessons from Kraftwerk before recording &quot;I Robot&quot; of the same year.  The haunting synths on &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; are awesome.  Unfortunately, the track carries over through most of the rest of the album which is a little too much repitition for me.  I would rather have another song of the caliber of those on the first side.  The first 4 tracks are definitely 5-star worthy, but the rest of the album is not nearly as solid, but I'll only knock it down a star.  Kraftwerk was a major influence on so many of my favorite recording artists of the early 1980s like Gary Numan and John Foxx.  It is amazing that they were making such albums in the mid 1970s, years before the electronic craze took over.  They were pioneers.  Every music collection should have at least one of their &quot;Werks&quot; and Trans-Europe Express is a good place to start, although I also recommend Computer World.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love this show. Having the opportunity to watch the never aired episodes is priceless.  The executives at Fox that cancelled this show obviously have no taste whatsoever and as Preacher once said a \\"special\\" afterlife location is waiting for them. The worst part about this set is the sadness that will come over you when you watch the last one knowing there are no more.       This truly was the best science fiction series ever to grace television and not only had spectacular special effects (accurate no sound in space part), but splendid writing (injected with very real and witty humor) and fantastic acting (so comfortable in their characters it could have been season three) as well.  It was dark, raw, and real!  I cannot say enough about this awesome series or this great DVD set, except thank you for making it!   Sidenote: If you are or were a fan of the Traveller RPG, you MUST watch Firefly!
B000002IGV|5.0|Like W.A.S.P., the music of Twisted Sister was often overshadowed by heavy make-up, over-the-top antics, and silly music videos.  Stay Hungry, however, is one of the best metal/hard rock albums to come out of the 1980s.  The two anthems &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot; aside, Stay Hungry includes some of the most intelligent lyrics and songwriting to come from this genre of 80s excessive rock bands.  The lyrics to &quot;Street Justice&quot; are, unfortunately, timeless in their relevance: &quot;A child's scream sliced through the air, but no one came or seemed to care. The man's description did little good.  A local stranger  from the neighborhood.  Those little kids, ooh, he left behind, with their mangled lives and their tortured minds.  Since he didn't seem to care then don't you think it's only fair?  Call for street justice.&quot;  &quot;The Price&quot; is a surprisingly pleasant slow number.  I once saw the lyrics to the chorus written next to the word &quot;price&quot; in a school dictionary, so it definitely touched someone's life.  &quot;Captain Howdy&quot; is powerful in its imagery of a killer who lures children to his home of doom.  The rest of the album just rocks!  Unfortunately, the band was never the same again, but they left behind one of the best rock albums of the 1980s...and a lot of ghastly costumes.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Read the book, loved it.  <BR>Saw the movie, loved it even more.  Come Oscar time some other<BR>films may find a whole new meaning to the cliche, &quot;You can't beat a dead horse&quot;.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|The Who's Tommy is not only a stunning musical achievement for the R&amp;B devotees, but also a striking mark in the history of rock opera.  With outright hits like &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, to subtle sleepers like &quot;1921&quot; Tommy captures you from the opening blasts of the carefully constructed &quot;Overture&quot;.  It coaxes you on a sojourn, with musical variety from pure rock surreality to near psychedelic (Dare I say, &quot;Doorsian&quot;) mood grooves.  Covering such basic thematic standbys as boy meets girl, to hinting at such lude concepts at molestation, The Who stay true to the Brit-rock tradition of testing the waters of the sea of bad taste.  Some may find topical objections to Tommy's direction, however, many more will find it in intriguing dive into the world of progressive rock, an art form in which The Who are not normally associated.<BR>    <BR>     Musically, The Who flash their credentials flamboyantly as they continue to beat, strum, and wail their way into the vaults of rock history.  Townshend in particular takes this opportunity to remind the rock world why he may very well be the Goliath of rhythm playing, his chord sequences during &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; alone are enough to put most rockers to shame as they pluck out their simplistic three chord licks.  A true masterpiece composition wise as well, as again Townshend's ability to construct a compelling and diverse, yet unified  musical work shines through on all movements.  And that is the only real downside you could put to the album, over unification.  However, that should not be held against Tommy for much like a great novel, it is enjoyed beginning to end, and not one chapter at a time.  And begining to end, I have no doubt, is exactly how you will enjoy it.  Whether you want it to or not, the magic of Tommy will capture you, and you will find yourself starting at the beginning every time.  So fire up a candle, turn down the lights, and join millions around the world who have found a little piece of themselves inside Tommy.<br />-Collin Hoffman
B0000DYJM6|5.0|My first exposure to grunge music was Pearl Jam *not Nirvana...* <br />I saw the video for &quot;Alive&quot; on Headbanger's Ball one night and was hooked. Nirvana was good.  But Pearl jam is still around and this album is no let down. Pick it up today!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Afterglow is the first Sarah album I've bought (only otherwise being familiar with her singles from Surfacing and Mirrorball), spurred on by the depth of the first track and single, &quot;Fallen.&quot;<br />I love it.  It may help that I've nothing of her past albums to compare it to, but it seems to me that as a unique effort, this is a wonderful, coherent, lush album.  It speaks of pain and solitude, comfort and peace.  It could stand to be longer, and it's true that there a few tracks that detract (around the middle of the album) from the experience.  But Afterglow is still a beautiful piece of work with gorgeous vocals from McLaughlin and solid, warm production.  The perfect winter album for snuggling up to the fire with a good book on a dark night.
B000002INJ|2.0|I'm usually not the type to buy a CD off of one song, but sometimes when I got some cash burning and a thirst from some harsh riffs I impulse buy. I'd heard of ManOWar before, and the song &quot;Hail and Kill&quot; and figured, why not. I listened to the CD about twice, then shelfed it. The entire arrogant and cheesy lyrics turned me off, and only a few good songs saved this from being a total let down.<br />1. Wheels of Fire - One of the good songs, it's fast and fun but nothing superb.<br />2. Kings of Metal - Ummm... kind of an ego trip with alright riffing to go with it.<br />3. Heart of Steel - A decent ballad, not great.<br />4. Sting of the Bumblebee - More annoying then cool, something original would have been nice.<br />5. The Crown and the Ring - Another decent song, the oragns are a nice touch, but again nothing spectacular.<br />6. Kingdom Come - Better than most of whats on the album.<br />7. Pleasure Slave - I'd probably have given a higher rating to this Album if it did not contain this terrible piece of garbage. More ego tripping, with moaning girls and some totally awful lyrics.<br />8. Hail and Kill - The whole reason I bought this CD, it's a fun song, something I'd hope would be consitent throughout the album.<br />9. The Warriors Prayer - Whats this!? It's not even a song! It's a grandpa telling some lame story to his grandson! I don't want to spend 4 1/2 minutes listening to this, maybe if they'd sprinkled 30 second snippets throughout the disc to further the story like Blind Guardian did in Nightfall.<br />10. Blood of the Kings - Well, it closes good, this song is pretty cool, but lyrics just kinda suck... what else is new.<br />Being that I was told that Kings of Metal was one of ManOWars best, I don't plan on buying anymore. Theres about 3 good songs on here.  Your money could better be spent elsewhere on some (old)Metallica, Iced Earth, Pantera, or Anthrax. Unless you're already a fan of ManOwar I really don't reccomend buying this CD.
B000067JG3|5.0|The Sound of Music is a movie you will watch over and over again. The music fills your heart and lightens your burden.  The acting is superb,the children are enchanting, the story is rich with drama, humor, adventure and love.  And the scenery is breathtaking.<br />It is a story for all ages and all people!<br />I love this movie!!!!
B00005JL1C|4.0|I absolutely love this movie! It's a classic 80's film...with humor, romance, and a couple of twists...not to mention a great cast, including: Eric Stoltz, Lea Thompson, &amp; Mary Stuart Masterson. It's a story we've all heard before: the beautiful, popular girl in high school falls for the charm of the romantic outcast...with a little help from his female friend. But it doesn't end there! You'll have to watch the movie, to find out what happens in the end...but I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the 80's genre of films. If you enjoyed &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; and &quot;Pretty In Pink&quot;...then chances are that you'll enjoy this movie, as well. :)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I am not a Britney Spears Fan.  Frankly I do not like Bubble Gum Pop.  I was on a messageboard and everybody was saying the album is not bubble gum pop and it's on Fire.  So I said what the hell I have an extra $15 in my pocket.  I got to work to listen to it and I was shocked that I actually liked it very very much.  Favorite Song Early Mornin' (remembering my club hopping days).  Any way if you have never liked Britney which I haven't you can not deny the girl this album.  She did a good Job.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Easily one of the most transcendant headphone albums ever created. You can hear just how much love, labor and care went into the making of this masterpiece as the beautiful noise washes over you. Such wonderful sounds...like Heaven on Earth.<br />I can't recommend this album highly enough.
B00006879E|5.0|When I first heard \\"Harder to Breathe\\" I was immediately amazed by their sound.  So, I bought the album.  At first, I didn't know how to react to it.  Songs About Jane is so different from anything I've ever heard before.  I didn't really like it.  Then I listened again.  The album is full of emotion, love, lust, anger, hate.  It's just so amazing, the feeling of the song just flows over you.  I absolutely love this album now.  They have truly sexy music and it's just wonderful.  I highly recommend their music to anyone.
B00005JLZN|3.0|I cant understand all the bad reviews this movie got. Without being the greatest I have ever seen, I consider it was quite honest and thoughtful. The acting is fine and the montage really decent. It has some disturbing twists but those are what makes you think. The way you discover the truth by viewing more and more of the infamous video tape was interesting. And no matter what anybody says, when Bloom finally reads the message &quot;This will set you free&quot; and views the whole tape, that is a great scene.
0385504209|2.0|My husband and mother-in-law raved about this book, so I plodded through it, but found the language stilted...it read like a bad romance novel to me.  I found his writing embarassing.  If you are looking for great literature, pass on this.  If Barbara Cartland is your hero, have at it.
B00000K2SD|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was blown away by the special effects, and by the &quot;Free your mind&quot; motif.  Each time I watch it, I pick up more and more allusions to other literary works and historical/biblical references, and each new discovery adds to the amazing power of the movie.  Recommended to all action fans and also a great literary movie- never to be forgotten!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This Is way better than Britney's other albums,If you like R&amp;B and Techno type recordings.My Favorite song is Toxic thats why I give this 5 stars
0385504209|1.0|You'd have to be fool to think this is a good novel.  As pure fiction it's badly written and unimaginative.  But, of course, it postures as &quot;possible history.&quot;  As &quot;possible&quot; as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion!  It's a pure play at widely held prejudices.  Nothing more.
B00006CXXU|5.0|It's sad that the media wants to make Christina upset by saying that her hair is this and her album is that, but what Christina tried to do was open up to the world and shows her.But since we are so surrounded by pop here and pop there thats all we know how to expect. And just like you and me Christina tried to show us that she is real and by strippin' down she knew that you were gonna say bad things,but it has gotten your attention and now over time we have learned to except the real Christina,and even though she picks fight a lot---I love to see her like that and to me she way better than the lip-syching/nasal artist Britney Spears--Now thats who is fake-so let christina be Xtina cause in the long run your gonna love her
B00008WG3U|5.0|The War on Errorism is a great Cd with good lyrics, good guitar/bass riffs and also with the marvelous NoFx sound!!!!! So for anyone who likes punk-rock, this cd is awesome!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A great tv show that was put down before its time, but flourishes on dvd.    Fox wisely decided to get Joss Whedon to create a new series for them following his fantastic Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel tv shows.  The they foolishly decided to air the episodes out of order (imagine the impact that would have been lost if WB had done that with Buffy) and cancel the most acclaimed new show on their schedule.    But now everyone watch this space western as it was meant to be seen...well, abbreviated of course, but 14 episodes is better than none (and three more than the 11 that aired).  All of the nuance that was lost by airing the episodes out of order comes out in watching all episodes in a short window.  The set looks great and the three unaired episodes are just as good as the ones that were aired.      If you were a fan of the show when it aired, then there is enough bonus value with the unaired episodes, the making of featurette and the entertaining commentary tracks to make it worth purchasing.  If you are a fan of Joss' other shows then you are almost guaranteed to find the same great dialogue, plotting, mysteries and characterizations here.  And if you've never tried out a Whedon show then this is a pretty good place to start as it is only 4 discs and it's self-contained.    Hopefully Joss & crew will get to shed light on some of the plot threads left uninvestigated in some other venue (a feature flim is coming in fall 2005).  Until then this set will remind you what great TV should be.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I LIKE THE ALBUM VERY MUCH L HAVE THE ALBUM IS EXCELLENT AND L THINK GIRLS ALOUD SONG JUMP IS BRILLIANT THAT SONG SHOULD WENT TO NUMBER 1
B000099T2L|5.0|I bought this album several months ago largely because of the first single &quot;Crazy In Love&quot;.  I was somewhat disappointed when there wasn't another single that came close to it.  I recently started listening again after &quot;Baby Boy&quot; became a hit.  I have come to appreciate what Beyonce' set out to do.  Keep in mind she couldn't release a Destiny Child like album and stand out on her own merit.  What she's done, in my opinion is displayed a wide variety of styles and sounds that actually work when you give them a chance and allow them to grow on you.  Anyone that would accuse her of not being able to sing is either tone deaf, or just plain ignorant.  I'm even more impressed with her live performances because unlike a lot of performers with vocal range, she goes for the gusto and doesn't drop down into lower ranges to coast through a performance.  All I have to say is I eagerly await future material by Beyonce.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I'm a HUGE Britney Spears fan, so I love all of her albums.  Advice to all those on the hate train, if you're not a fan...don't buy the album.  Simple as that.<br />This album is a lot edgier that her other \\"pop\\" albums.  This one has a club vibe to it.  She has contributed to writing on a lot of the songs.  It is definitely an album for the more mature audience, though.  The 12 year olds that were her fans in the beginning and have grown up...you can listen to it.  If you're a 12 year old fan right now...you shouldn't listen to it.  It's very grown up and sexual.  Fine for me...but maybe not for everyone.  I think that Britney is maturing musically and this album shows that.<br />My favorite song...Everytime.  Beautiful!
B000002GDJ|5.0|First of all excuse me for my enghlish.<BR>It was the spring of 1980 and i've listen &quot;walking on the moon&quot; on the radio. Was a music's shock for me. But nothing like the LP. My school friend give me his Lp and after i've listen &quot;Regatta de blanc&quot; for a mounth without stop.<BR>Energy, genius, groove, a wonderful mix of rock punk and reggae.<BR>In the begin the explosive energy of &quot;Message in a bottle&quot;; the melancholic of &quot;The Bed's Too Big Without You&quot;; &quot;Bring On the night&quot;, &quot;walking on the moon&quot; and also the titletrack are one of the most beautiful song's of the 80's.<BR>For me it's one of then 10 Lp to save from the world's end.<BR>At the end i've never give back the Lp to my friend!!
0385473788|5.0|Anne Frank's diary was found in &quot;the secret annex&quot; of an old office building where she spent the last years of her life.  It was in her father's possession until he made copies of it, and gave them to friends and family of the Franks.  A few years later, he revised and published it.  Since then it has been translated into many different languages and shared with people all around the world.<br />  In Anne's diary, it tells a lot about what it was like for Jews during world war two.  The Franks, an old dentist and another family, go into hiding in &quot;the secret annex&quot; of Mr. Frank's office building.  It tells how they hear the guns and bombs attacking Amsterdam, their town in Holland, and try to live off of the food friends, who work in the building, bring them.  It suggests that living in the attic and second story of one building can be tough.  Especially when you have people watching, correcting, and critiquing your every move.  Anne suffers through fright, discouragement, and criticism.  Anne's Diary is about what happens in &quot;the secret annex&quot; while living with the constant fear of discovery and death.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Favorite tracks: Breathe on Me, Toxic (great for dance track),Touch of My Hand (despite hype, it's a lovely soft song with very general lyrics about loving one's self -- i didn't find it overly sexual at all), Shadow (lovely voice here), and Everytime -- a very personal soft song by Britney with lovely and hard to forget piano tune in background).  Overall one of my favorite CD of 2003.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This boxed set allows fans to take a look at what might have been. Ridley Scott gets the chance to tinker with his original classic film and the results are very good although I don't think it's necessarily an improvement on his taunt, suspenseful original version (both are available on the same DVD). <br />James Cameron was locked on the running time and had to edit out a whole lot of footage for Aliens. While the theatrical version is great, it's clear that his original vision (like that of The Abyss another Fox release where he was locked into a certain length for the film) would have been far, far superior. The extended version (new sequences that gives a lot of background on the characters, Newt, etc. and features some new miniatures and opticals) is the better film of the two. Still, it's nice to have both versions. <br />David Fincher's work print version of Alien 3 is vastly superior in my mind to the theatrical version. Keep in mind the final work print was assembled without Fincher's input and was an unfinished &quot;edit&quot; before Fox took it away from him. Fox has added new CGI visuals to give the work print a more polished, finished look. Regardless, it's a glimpse into a much better film. I wouldn't call it my favorite but it came up a number of notches even with what happens to the characters from Aliens.<br />Alien Resurrection hit the wrong note with a lot of folks. Perhaps it's Joss Whedon's unorthodox view on the Alien saga or his attempt to reinvent it in a new way with an touch of irony and humor. Like Whedon's work on Buffy or Firefly, perhaps it's an acquired taste. Either way, he took a bold approach and tried to shake the &quot;series&quot; up a bit. I personally find it a very good addition to the series. They each have their own unique tone. <br />I haven't even had time to dig into all the extras yet but this is definitely a DVD boxed set that is worth investigating! I don't care for the accordion style box, either so went out to buy acouple of snap cases for the discs.<br />Picture quality for all three varies from very good to outstanding. Same with the sound quality. Aliens is a bit grainy but that's how Cameron intended it--to have a sense of &quot;reality&quot; to it. <br />For laserdisc owners disc 9 has almost all the stuff that was on the original laserdisc special editions of a couple of years ago. <br />Re: The review by Jimmyjames8<br />As Hitchcock would say, it's only a movie. Movies have their own internal logic to which they are consistent. Once you set up the world, folks will come accept it. That said<BR>1) The ship shakes during the opening sequence? Gee I never noticed that but it could be because the opticals were done in 1978 prior to digital effects. Or, perhaps, it's the fact that a ship &quot;shakes&quot; perhaps it's flying at high acceleration .<BR>2) Dallas and Lambert (although, keep in mind, it's only a movie) probably &quot;could&quot; have gone down to get Cain and hoisted him up the same way he was let down.<BR>3) I haven't checked the diet requirements for an Alien lately but keep in mind--it's only a movie. Maybe the creature secured its food from the food stores or ate other organic material on the ship. We don't immediately know the answers to why all creatures develop the way they do until we study them. Alien isn't a biology class but, instead, a movie.<BR>4) Scott has been quoted extensively about rain in the ship--the ship is so massive in size that condensation occurs at the top creating little areas of rain. The moisture in the air could have come from the recycling plants on the ship. Then again, it is after all, repeat after me...only a movie.<BR>5) The coolant is probably for the suspended animation chamber. Since it's made to hold less than three people. I thought that was made pretty clear by the dialogue (or maybe I just figured it out on my own).<BR>6) All four of the self destruct rods go down because it has been activated. She's still trying todeactivate it and perhaps  (I'm using my head here folks) if one &quot;rod&quot; is deactived it can prevent the nuclear device from going critical and causing a nuclear explosion. <BR>7) Alan Dean Foster's Alien was based on Dan O'Bannon's screenplay. I'm sure that Foster had access to all the drafts and could generally get questions answered. If not, he made it up.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect from this show, but was pleasantly surprised. Why this show got cancelled is beyond me. I must be crazy, because this show is outstanding. What a mess with the network airing the pilot and other episodes way out of order and not giving this show a better chance. It's just plain insane. I can only hope that another network can bring it back, or for a Firefly movie, because this is an excellent show in an excellent sci-fi world. A real quality mix of drama, comedy, sci-fi, and western, and it all works.
B000002KB8|5.0|Ok, first of all I want to say that I am a complete sab head and dedicated fan of the band. I'm not only an Ozzy era liker, but it is my favorite (the dio era is the only one that comes close to these guys). Ok, now to the review.<BR>1. Black Sabbath-1 of the best songs Sabbath ever made and the perfect song to start of the album that would change music history.5/5<BR>2. The Wizard-blues based riffs and cool harmonica playing by the Ozzman. 5/5<BR>3.Wasp/Behind the Wall of Sleep/Bassically/N.I.B- my favorite moment on the whole album. People say that the songs running together mess them up but I say that that's what makes these songs cool. Wasp/Behind the Wall of Sleep is a great riff and Iommi showcases his knack for writing songs in these. Bassically is an awesome bass solo (my band plays these songs with Bassically included). Now, the best song on the whole album, N.I.B. This song is one of Sabbath's best riffs through their whole career. Definately not to be missed.5/5<BR>4. Wicked World- not the best but still good. Live version on Live at Last is better 3/5<BR>5. Sleeping Village/A Bit of Finger/The Warning- ok song compilation thingy. Solo is a bit to long in the Warning but it all comes together nicely. 4/5<br />Well hope this review helps anybody out who wants the album.<BR>Sabbath Rulez.
0375422307|4.0|It takes time getting into this book and even once you do - you remain in a slight state of shock...a little uncomfortable. Comic horrors? ... The mind does not grasp this mode of writing, especially in the beginning when you wonder whether to laugh or cry and remain with an uneasy feeling of &quot;something is wrong&quot;. Yes, you are right, something is definitely wrong. This however is a feeling I assume the writer wanted you to feel - you are in horror, but life goes on so you find things to laugh about. You have to try and continue your regular life, even if it's living under a strict regime. <BR>I guess it is always easier to understand history when you know the small mundane details of the lives of one person or one family. Otherwise this history is not comprehensive. Was it not easier to believe that all Iranians accepted the new regime and its new policies? Sarapti makes you understand how life could have gone on in spite of the surrounding atmosphere and gives you an inside look of what was the surrounding atmosphere.<BR>&quot;This really happened&quot; or &quot;My father really said that&quot; mentions the author several times in the book as if to say: &quot;pay attention, this really happened. It might seem crazy but no, I have lived in this craziness&quot;.<BR>As I wrote before the writing is not always comprehensible. In the beginning the author mentions several issues you fully understand only in a second reading or only later in the book - for example &quot;our maid did not eat with us&quot;, &quot;my dad drove a Cadillac&quot; or different conversations with god. In the beginning, when you come armed with your expectations about the book this does not fit at all, but only falls to place much later.  All this adds to the stark feeling of this book magnified by the black and white drawings. <BR>The most haunting picture is of course the last one who can touch every person who had to experience separation. At once the tragedy of this whole situation is made clear.<BR>The book is very interesting although not enjoyable - was never intended to be such.
0679311718|5.0|Dallaire's book is a powerful call to action that damns the so called civilised world for its failure to act in the face of Rwanda'a genocide.  Dallaire and his companions stand out as rare beacons of light amongst those who refused to act to save Rwanda.<BR>It was a heart wrenching book to read, because it becomes clear that the genocide could have been stopped, but none of the so-called great powers cared, because they did not feel that Rwanda was worth saving.  As Dallaire quotes the American officer, it would take 85000 Rwandan deaths to justify the death of an American soldier, whereas in Iraq, it takes only the US's desire for cheap gas for their SUVs to justify the death of American soldiers.<BR>Dallaire's brutally honest accout of his ongoing struggle with his inner demons that are legacy of his service in Rwanda, only increase my admiration for him.  For me, he is a true hero and a true soldier in a time when so many people in uniform are more politician than soldier such as Lewis MacKenzie.<BR>Dallaire is a model for us to follow, so that humanity will not fail again, I can only that we can live up to his, and the others who served under his command, example.  As I read of the courage of his troops, especially the Ghanaians and the Tunisians and especially the example of colonel &quot;Tiko&quot; Tikola, I was reminded that courage is not limited to the First world, yet we hear so little about their bravery.<BR>Read this book, and confront the truth that we failed the people of Rwanda, and we continually to fail the people of this world and we must accept our responsibilty for the structures of this world that helped to create Rwanda and the other killing places of this world.<BR>God bless you, Romeo Dallaire, for me you personify what Jesus shares with us in the beautitudes:-<BR>&quot;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God&quot;

Sorry, no &quot;F&quot; words are spoken in it, just good dialog and an excellent story that makes you feel good.  It deserves an Oscar.

I was hopping the Sound quality would be better then it is being redone in Dolby Digital Surround it's good but not great for sound.<BR>Over all this is a Great DVD for the Pink Floyd Fan <BR>    If you don't know anything about this DVD it's not a live concert in Pompeii at all <BR>It's a live performance done in Pompeii with no Audience. At the time they thought a live concert show would not be in style <BR>Now days it would be nice to see early Pink Floyd Live in concert but that is not what this is at all.

B000002G9S|4.0|I first listened to this album after it came out in 1970, when my older brother bought it on 8-track, and since then I've owned it on LP, cassette, and CD.  Of course, it boasts one big hit (&quot;All Right Now&quot;) and one near-hit (&quot;Fire and Water&quot;), both great songs; however, the tune that continues to haunt my memories is &quot;Oh I Wept,&quot; a spare, bluesy number that captures perfectly the paradoxical combination of despair and hopefulness that characterized my childhood and adolescence.<br />It's curious that the most interesting solo on the album is Andy Fraser's bass solo on &quot;Mr. Big.&quot;  Paul Kossoff had a vibrato and tone to die for, but a careful listener will note that almost all of his guitar solos on this album are built around the same lick; he obviously had his technical limitations.  Simon Kirke's nifty drum solo at the end of &quot;Fire and Water&quot; doesn't jibe with his rudimentary (boring, really) drumming on the first Bad Company album; one wonders if he acquired a serious drinking problem in the interim!  And Paul Rodgers, who is as close to being a virtuoso singer as there has ever been in rock music, was never better than on this record.  Add it all up, and you have one of the seminal albums of the era, one that is well worth owning.
B00004C4HS|5.0|Time and time again we are confronted with artists who put out a great debut album and never climb that high ever again. When it comes to talking about the paradigmatic example of such a phenomenon my choice would be King Crimson and their debut album &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King.&quot; Released in 1969 with its distinctive cover art, this was the album that set the standard for progressive/psychedelic rock for the next decade. Except for the title track the songs are ensemble efforts by guitarist Robert Fripp, drummer Michael Giles, bass player and lead vocalist Greg Lake, keyboard player Ian McDonald, and lyricist Peter Sinfield.<br />The best track on the album is the first, &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man,&quot; with its big main riff and jazz-rock middle section (&quot;Mirrors&quot;). The music is somewhat distorted at times, but that does not stop the group's musical virtuosity from coming through. As you would expect from the title, the song paints a picture of dystopian future that embodies the worst tendencies of the late 1960s, and remains the standard by which other progressive rock epics are judged. In terms of political sensibilities nothing comes close. The song also stands out because the following track, &quot;I Talk to the Wind,&quot; is more folk-rock and constitutes a sort of cleansing of the palate before proceeding to the rest of the album (it is actually a song members of the group had played on earlier efforts).<br />The title track is not the best King Crimson song, but it is probably their best known one (and the one song that was written just by McDonald and Sinfeld). The conceit is of a medieval court afflicted by a black queen, fire witch, and other equally dark images heading for total destruction. It is a daring finality, teetering on the brink of the sort of bombastic pomposity that often afflicted progressive rock (Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's &quot;Tarkus Suite,&quot; with its synthesizer excess is the example that springs to mind). Musically on this album as a whole it is McDonald who makes the biggest mark on the album, playing mellotron and assorted other instruments like saxophones, although Fripp's guitar is also prominent. When I was growing up the singing voice I most wanted to have was Greg Lake's, and this is the album when he sounds the best. The result is that &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; is one of the albums that has to be considered when you are making a list of top albums from the Sixites or in the history of progressive rock music. It does not matter that King Crimson had a revolving door lineup and that it would take them years to come up with anything close to this classic album.to mind).

B000092Q4U|5.0|The only thing that I can think of when I listen to this CD is how Randy Blythe stood before the crowd in the mosh pit and said he wanted to see the &quot;Wall of Death&quot; and how he wanted that pit to look like a war zone. This album is beyond intense, it is so frantic I can't help but get angry everytime I listen to it. Sounds kind of dangerous while driving, doesn't it.<br />  Welcome to my world, the world of some of the scariest music on the planet. These guys can play among the best in Europe and can out do many of the best metal bands in America. From beginning to end, &quot;As The Palaces Burn&quot; plays like a sledgehammer mercilessly pounding the current pop culture trend to dust. D. Randall Blythe is an intense vocalist that brings so much to this group that, without him, songs like &quot;Ruin&quot;, &quot;11th Hour&quot;, &quot;Purify&quot;, &quot;As The Palaces Burn&quot;, and &quot;Boot Scraper&quot; would be toned down considerably. I am not saying that he makes the band because, by far, this isn't true. The guitarists, bassist, and that overpowering drummer behind them make this band so meciless that it even scares me sometimes. These tracks just cry for violence in the pit and for violent headbanging in your own living room. This has been one of my favorite CDs, besides &quot;Stings of Conscience&quot; by Unearth, for the last few months.<br />  Also, I noticed that someone stated that Lamb of God was terrible live. I believe that you were wrong because seeing Blythe and company thrashing out on stage and actually performing the music adds so much to the experience. I do believe that they beat out the Deftones in being the loudest band on the planet at this current time. Yes, I went to the Ball concert and they were my favorite act, besides Shadows Fall and Killswitch Engage, that night because they were so explosive. The music kicks you in the teeth and keeps pounding until you have no will to continue resisting the urge to thrash along in great anger. If any metal fan, Gothenburg or other wise, is looking for a violent album get this one. It is a definite keeper, not a waste of money.<br />  By the way, blood did hit the floor that night. I saw a couple of the moshers faces after that set. These guys are the leaders of the metal resurgence in America. Agree or don't, it doesn't matter.n great anger.

B0000640S3|3.0|Having been betrayed by his government a couple of times too often, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) needed a better motive to leap back into action for &quot;Rambo III.&quot;  This is provided when Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) goes off to Afghanistan to help the Mujahedeen rebels fight the Soviet invaders only to be captured by Colonel Zaysen (Marc de Jonge).  Rambo, who had refused to go with Trautman because he is in Thailand becoming a Buddhist, now heads for Afghanistan on an unauthorized rescue mission.<br />&quot;Rambo III&quot; has the formula down, which is a way of saying the plot is totally predictable and an excuse for a whole lot of explosions.  Rambo is the most buffed up Buddhist the world has ever seen and I have a minor theory that he has the whole Sampson thing going with his hair getting longer in each movie.  This 1988 film was not only the most expensive film ever made when it was released (a whopping $63 million in those pre-&quot;Titanic&quot; days), but made it into the &quot;Guiness Book of World Records&quot; as the most violent film ever made with a grand total of 221 acts of violence and over 108 deaths (it must be the former number that is important because a whole lot of nukes go off at the end of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and the entire planet exploded at the end of &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;).<br /><br />Once again, the political dimensions of a &quot;Rambo&quot; film came into play, with the series shifting to Afghanistan, which was being called the Soviet Union's Vietnam, a metaphor that actually turned out to be more than wishful thinking.  True, the Mujahedeen of yesterday became the Taliban down the road, but I still remember when the American public applauded the idea that the Shah of Iran had been deposed and replaced by the Ayatollah Khomeni.  But in 1988 &quot;Rambo III&quot; was considered an exercise in freedom fighting and the Soviet Union was still the Evil Empire.<br />The obvious analog to &quot;Rambo III&quot; is &quot;Rocky IV,&quot; in which Stallone continues to explore American-Soviet relationships.  However, today &quot;Rambo III&quot; has been stripped of its politics and reduced to a non-stop action film.  If there was some creativity to go along with the violence, as in the forest sequence in the original &quot;First Blood,&quot; then this film would be able to rise about the level of cartoon violence, but that is not the case.quot;Rambo III&quot; is &quot;Rocky IV,&quot; in which Stallone continues to explore American-Soviet relationships.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Ok, saw this show like 5 hours ago and absolutely loved it. I have seen soo many shows on Broadway, 100+. This was by far one of the best I've ever seen. However, that does not mean it's perfect. The score is certainly not the best I've ever heard, it's not even close. I will give Stephen Schwartz credit, unlike most of his other shows, not all of the songs to this show sound the same. Kudos Steve. And some of the songs are quite catchy, &quot;Popular&quot; and &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; especially. Kristin Chenoweth deserves the Tony. Idina was good, fantastic really. But Kristin stole the show yet again. Her comic timing is just too good. And that voice - she was trained as an Opera singer, didja know that? Course ya did! Idina can belt. Joan Rivers was in the front row and no word of lie, jumped when Idina hit the high notes. It was great, I was waiting for her wig to fall off. Anyway...The book. Oh, I read it twice and long before this show was even an embryo, Loved it. I'm sorry, I have some serious issues with this show because it took liberties with the script that are just, well, wrong. And don't even get me started on the ending. But please keep in mind, I LOVED this show. Ok, heres where I really had fun: The set. Eugene Lee is a god. My favorite designer by far, and not b/c of this show. 30 years ago, in the same theater (then called the URIS) Eugene built the most magnificent set for Sweeney Todd. This one is absolutely brilliant. See the show and tell me where you think the 13 million dollars went. The set. And the costumes and lighting were tremendous. I predict the show will sweep the Design and Technical categories of the Tonys this year, among others. Brilliant. The special effects were great too. Ok, so the script was botched, the music occasionally blase. But those leading ladies are enough to spend 100 bucks to see. Look at the set as your bonus prize. And when you're there, buy a ski hat for &quot;Your little dog...DoDo.&quot;
B00000G3Q4|1.0|This is, without any doubt, one of the worst films ever made. I'm not a film snob or punk trying to antagonize the deluded legion of dupes who idolize this piece of garbage.  I'm just trying to provide balance to the roars of approval for this not-at-all-good &quot;film.&quot;  Seriously people, have you even watched this stupid thing?  It is AWFUL (and not even in an &quot;Ed Wood meets Dead Alive meets tongue-in-cheek&quot; way)!  There is, and I want this to be crystal clear, NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS MOVIE!  NOTHING...ZERO...ZILCH!!!  Save your stars (seriously, FIVE stars for this crap - ARE YOU INSANE?!) for a movie that delivers...anything.  Can we please relegate Sam Raimi and this &quot;train wreck&quot; to the pile of hyped up hacks and &quot;cult faves&quot; where they belong?!
B0000A9GLS|4.0|From first glance, IDENTITY really doesn't seem that great. However, as one begins watching the film, you are swept up into the movie's engaging plot.  As a thriller, it's great and as a thriller with a twist it's one of the most original to come around in a long time.  IDENTITY revolves around 10 people who all become stranded at the same creepy motel on a dark and story night. Somehow contected to all of this is the hearing concerning a bald-headed mass murderer. This hearing doesn't come into play much, but has a very important connection to the rest of the movie.  Anyway, back at the ranch, I mean, hotel.  One by one the people at the hotel start dieing. Everyone becomes suspicious of everyone else until no one has a clue to what's going on.  Things get wierder and wierder until the film's climax and all the loose ends are tied up.  However, even then things aren't what they seem to be.  IDENTITY is an interesting movie.  It was a bit better than I thought it was going to be, and the fine performance of the cast (especially John Cusack) and the great freshly-original screenplay made the film better.  It's a nice movie to watch with someone on a rainy night.
6305014140|2.0|In my opinion this is not a great anime.  People say it has a great plot.  But in my opinion thats what this movie rushes the most.  The action and the characters are good.  But the main character fights every bad guy in such a short amount of time.  The plot barely existed, it was just killing most of the time.  How people consider this a good anime, let alone one of the best is completely beyond me.  The sex and violence doesn't offend me it's just the lack of creativity and depth that turns me off to this.  <br />If you want a great anime involving samurai or ninja I reccomend Samurai X.  Much better plot, action, and just about everything.
0451160916|3.0|Stephen King's books I've discovered over the past 20 years have always catered to the most common denominator(namely blue collar people) his horror novels are some of the only ones that have actually scared me, while annoying me at the same time and they almost always have the same recycled characters; writers, village idiots, neglected women or abused wives, lonely drifters, red necks, goofy villains,ect. His books usually start off pretty good with rich characterization and an intrigueing premise, but as you progress to the middle they start to get bogged down with too many plot twists and mind numbing descriptions, sometimes annoying dialogue, irritating protaganists always doing something illogical, by the time you reach the end of the story it really starts to fall apart, incondite dialogue, ridiculous reactions to dangerous situations, mountains of descriptions the size of the Himalayas, suddenly at the end the story it falls flat on it's face.....SSPPLLAAAAATTT!.  This book is actually better than most of his later work, it suffers from some of these, but like Carrie it's mercifully shorter and to the point, and yes it's scary.   They made two film versions of The Shining , though Kubrick's version actually improved on the book slightly, by taking out alot of the silly sometimes cartoonish moments (like the bush animals in the maze coming to life , giving the kid a minimal role Thank GOD!, giving Jack an axe instead of a mallet) making it a darker, deeper, creepier, psychological thriller, too bad he forgot to put in more dialogue(a Kubrick trait) to flesh out the story! (prevents it from being a 5 star film).  The new version is a WRETCHED train wreck avoid like the plague! horrible is too delicate a word to describe it. Read This book, you might like it better than I did.
1577311523|5.0|The book, &quot;The Power of Now&quot; by Ekhart Tolle is one of my most treasured favorites. I cannot recall words of such stinging clarity in the spiritual books of my generation (and I have read many of them). Tolle's simple words have amazing depth. Here, the most esoteric, mystical concepts are highly accessible and (surprise!) practical.  The ideas in this book have truly transformed my awareness. In the pile of books on this topic, this one alone shines with a glowing aura. Highly recommended!!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I'm glad she took time to record/write her second offering. I think the interval period between the two records was just perfect. The second album doesn't abandone the style that made her popular, but it does head in a new direction. A direction that will help her grow.<br />Even though \\"Diary of...\\" is really better than \\"Songs in A minor\\". I still feel and get inspired thru the music on \\"A Minor\\". In \\"Diary of\\" Alicia works with Timbaland and Steve Storch? but thankfully doesn't head into the -no-hope-or-soul-zone- of heavy commericalized R&B/Hip-Hop music like Beyonce, Tamia, Thalia, Britney, Ashanti or Blu Cantrell. <br />Alicia Keys is talented, but I wouldn't go too far and say she is the MOST or the ONLY one that is talented. Out of all the talent in R&B/Soul music these days, she is the one who gets the most credit for being \\"Talented\\", when there are many other artistes who deserve the same amount of credit: Lauryn Hill, Jill Scott, Erykah Badu & her rival @ the Grammys: India.Arie. Who have all released flawless and inspirational debuts/or follow-ups. <br />\\"Diary of Alicia Keys\\"? Hmm? This time around I am able to rock and flow with the music -unlike her debut when I was judging and annalyzing this artiste. Her intro is a reminiscent of her previous work and reminds why we love this girl. Then there's the lovable \\"Karma\\" which is about a Break-Up/Make-Up situation. The song reminds me of Lauryn Hill's \\"Ex-Factor\\", but Alicia's song is much more Hip-Hop orientated and the hook is just irresistible. I love these lines of the hook: <br />\\"I remember when/I was all alone/Waitin' 4 you/To 2-3o'clock in the morn\\" <br />It's definitly gonna be the second single lifted of this #1 album. \\"Heartburn\\" is a musical experiment which turns out okay, and shows us a rockier side of A.Keys which we've never seen before. \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" is a strange choice of a single, and I'm surprised the promo CD even reached the radio station. It is real interesting and something I've never heard of. Then Alicia tries some old-school R&B, (ya know back when da music was soulful and good) and teaches us a lesson on SoulMusic history the medley of Gladys Knights' \\"Walk On By\\"/\\"If I Was Your Woman\\". <br />Luckily for us the album doesn't downfall (unlike most of today's albums) after the first 5 tracks. It keeps on pumpin' with more Hip-Hop/R&B Upbeat songs: \\"Dragon Days\\" -About a sort of folk tale like Shrek? And strangely it's my favorite song on the CD. \\"Samsonite Man\\" -I still don't get what she's singing but the hook and chorus are to die for. \\"Wake Up\\" & \\"Slow Down\\" which are more serious songs which tell us of moral behaviour -reminds me of Lauryn Hill & Erykah Badu. \\"Slow Down\\" has ?chimp munk? vocals like Mariah's \\"Boy (I Need U)\\"? strange usage of musical techniques, especially since it's co-written by such a creative music composer: Vidal Davis -Jill Scott collaborator! <br />The album doesn't include many ballads and the ones which are available don't satisfy like \\"Goodbye\\", \\"Why Do I Feel So Sad\\", \\"Butterflyz\\" and \\"Fallin'\\" did on her debut. \\"If I Ain't Go You\\" is sweet and at time cringe-able. \\"If You Really Love Some\\" is good but not on the same pedestal as \\"Woman's Worth\\" or \\"Goodbye\\" -not enough emotion! <br />The outro interlude \\"Nobody Not Really\\" is a clone of \\"Caged Bird\\" and really pointless. It's a huge hyperbole and a contradiction. The music on it reminds me of the song \\"Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" -another pointless song. The album has great musical direction, lyrical style, integrity, and soul. But something is jst missing to make it complete.<br />\\"Streets of New York\\" isn't included on the US or Australian Version. And if that song was the debut single it would've been so good! I was looking forward to hearing it again. If that song was on the album, it would've completed the missing piece. A song with Rapper as superb as Nas and Rakim! I hope Alicia Keys includes the song on the \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" single. <br />The DVD: Nobody seems to be reviewing the DVD. The DVD is like a intro the Alicia Keys for any new fans. It's got songs from her debut playing in the back ground. It talks about Alicia as an artist, The experience of fame and the success of her debut. Behind the scenes on: \\"making of Diary\\", tour, concerts, song-writing, photoshots, and many interview with Miss Keys. The DVD inspires you to listen to the album with an open heart. It also includes scenes with Christina Aguilera, Free, Rodney Jerkins, JD and D'angelo.
0446677450|5.0|I am a middle class small business owner.  Although I am not a paycheck to paycheck employee (which this book is mainly targeted toward), I did get a huge wakeup call with this book.  I am now committed to investing in income producing assets to gain financial freedom. This book discusses financial freedom in a way that cannot be ignored. I recommend another book, Optimal Thinking--How to Be Your Best Self as a companion to this book.  In my opinion, Optimal Thinking is the Think and Grow Rich of this millenium.  It shows you how to make the most of your mind and create the best possible results in any situation.
B00003W8NM|5.0|this movie is a type of movie you have to pay attention but it pays off so that your not confused later on the movie.it has action,fighting,and a script in which you have to listen.at the end i wanted the movie to keep going.you probaly will to if you watch it. this movie is a must see or buy if you all ready watched it.
0060900075|5.0|.  What does Zen, Hindu and various forms of meditation have in common with poor diet, fasting and starvation, with self inflicted body wounds that bring on infection, with chanting songs and poems that hyperventilate, with yogic breathing exercises? Cerebral Infarction, or as Huxley words as inhibiting the brain's cerebral reduction valve, draining the required glucose to maintain a filtered, that is a reduced amount, of reality to be perceived for the survival of the human species. Whether this science is empirically true or not, the connection is most certainly there. One can find such revelatory and hallucinogenic experiences in the Hindu Upishads and Vedas, the Old and New Testaments and all cultures which have mystical experiences. The Catholic mystics called this experience the \\"gratuitous grace.\\"    Anotherwards, these various forms of ancient religious exercises were designed to allow greater portions of reality to be perceived \\"Mind at Large,\\" by otherwise a limited and filtered human mind that only perceives limited amounts of reality. And both in ancient times with the use of etheogenic/hallucinogenic plants, and now in modern times with laboratory extraction and use of such plants this opening of perception (doors of perception) of the human mind, are opened to allow such beneficial observation.     According to Huxley, this is not an escape to utopia, nor an ultimate answer, however it is an experience that will ever change the human in a most beneficial way, where he will never quite be the same but will have a newer and deeper understanding of art, creativity and perception as never before. Not as a simple recreational tool, but an advancement for the intellectual.     I agree with his assessment.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Linkin Park is a very angry band and, even though they don't swear in any of their songs, they're not a very good example to the younger generation who listens to them. I'm in that younger generation, 14 years old to be exact. About a year ago I was totally taken with them and not realizing that their songs were changing me into a rebellious teen. I finally got over that whole Linkin craze and saw that, as much as I liked their songs, I had to stop listening to them. Even though I'm a Christian I can't help but fall down sometimes, and so I'm giving you some advice: don't go the way I did, just steer away from the bad stuff. Like it says in my title, the guys in Linkin Park are talented, but that's all.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|People are saying this is the best sci-fi in a long time. I disagree. Star Trek doesn't hold a candle to this. This is the best ever. Maybe the original Star Wars movies rival it, but it's a close call. The space western theme is genius and makes perfect sense. As Trek so aptly put it and then failed to demonstrate, space is a frontier, much like the American old west. People are creating new settlements. Those that brave this frontier are those poor or oppressed looking for better opportunities, those seeking adventure, and generally anyone disaffected with the rest of civilization. Communication back to civilization is slow given the distance. People tend to move into new areas faster than the law can establish it's presence and people are forced to defend themselves against bandits and savages.<br />There are so many details that make a true sci-fi fan drool. There's the strict, no sound in space policy, The genius use of language oddities that are perfectly understandable but different enough from current speech patterns to convey the feeling that this is a different time period. There are none of standard sci-fi crutches like pulling new tech out of no where to cover over a plot hole and then conveniently losing it the next episode when that same tech could solve the plot in the first five minutes. The characters survive on their wits, not their tech. All these things work together to make this the best sci-fi show of all time.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I've written a number of reviews praising this great film, but I've failed to mention on crucial aspect that continues to please and fascinate me; this is a very relaxing movie that soothes me, not disturbs me. The long silences, the understated, sometimes muted back ground music and the dialogue are all very moody and make this a film easy to watch repeatedly. A real work of art that grows deeper with each viewing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Space cowboys\\" doesn't begin to cover it.  FIREFLY is an absolute phenomenon.  A very fresh, stimulating and highly entertaining sci-fi show.  The fictional Firefly universe is a complely new myth, and it's a hoot.  This is one for the history books. That it was canceled so soon before it had a chance to build its audience is one of the biggest blunders of all time.  <br />The cast is superb, the set is wonderful, the scripts are brilliant.  Buy this DVD and enjoy the show.... again, and again, and again, and again, and again.
630179513X|5.0|This is the best of three in the Back to the Future trilogy.  It was set in the past and in the west during the times of cowboys, indians and especially gun sliggers.  I loved all of the reference to past events, and the humor it brought to the film.  This is a film I can watch over and over again, unlike the first in the trilogy.  Unlike the second film in the trilogy this film kept my attention, and wasn't so off-the-wall that it was unbelievable.  This is one that will be in my home collection.

6303168507|5.0|This is a sad, but moving story about a man who tried to make something good come of a bad situation.  Oscar Schindler risked all and lost a lot in his attempt to save Jews who were being systematically murdered by the Nazi regime in Germany during World War II.  <br />This movies captures so much.  Pain, suffering, survival, breif happiness, and gratitude.  It is a close up look at a time in history many would like to forget.  Be prepared to cry, be angry, and at the same time remember that even in bad situations good people still exist.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not one to watch commentaries or &quot;making of&quot; specials, but I just couldn't get enough of Firefly.<br />One note - the gag reel on the DVD is a slimmed-down version of the original.  If you have an Internet connection I still recommend downloading the Firefly gag reel from your favourite P2P network.  It includes Nathan Fillion mocking the seriousness of The Message, a chase scene with the Milenium Falcon, and more.
B000002H72|4.0|An essential Pixies LP (the 1st too). Hard hitting, raw, and powerful. Arguably the best Pixies release ever, though I'd argue that their final album \\"Trompe Le Monde\\" is just as good. Regardless, if you're a beginner to The Pixies, this is a must have. Contains the favorites \\"Debaser\\", \\"Monkey Gone to Heaven\\", and \\"Here Comes Your Man\\".
0553213105|4.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a one-of-a-kind book.  When your start to read this intriguing book, you will see its magnificent plot.  The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family.  The family worried because their estate is entailed and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet only have daughters.  When an estate is entailed, only a male can inherit the estate.  Mrs. Bennet wants to help her daughter find a wealthy husband so she could be financially well off, but that wasn't her only reason.  She also wanted to see her daughters get married and become mothers.  That's where the entire novel becomes interesting.<br />Well I don't really have a favorite chapter because it had many chapters that caught my attention and made me see things in another way.  But if I would have to choose a chapter I would choose chapter one because that's where you see what the novel will be about.  This novel would be perfect for teenagers and up to read.<br />One literary device that I appreciated from the novel was imagery because I could picture big events in the novel in my head.  For example, one big event that I could picture in my head was when Charles Bingley, a wealthy man, rented the manor known as Netherfield Park and that causes a great stir in the neighboring village of Longbourn.  What specifically creates an image for me is that Jane Austen is very descriptive in her writing and she has a way of showing things to the readers.  To be descriptive in her writing she uses powerful words to set the mood for what's taking place.  For example, in chapter 22 and 23, news arrives that Mr. Collins has proposed marriage to Charlotte Lucas and she has accepted.  Elizabeth is shocked but Mrs. Bennet, of course, is furious with her daughter Elizabeth for allowing a husband to escape her.  Before that had happened, Mr. Collins had proposed marriage to Elizabeth, but she had refused.  The mood went from pleasant to drastic in such a short moment.  I really like this awesome novel because it opened up a new world for me; it showed me that in the old days things were different from what they are now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is simply the best sci fi show ever.  It mixes old west and furturistic sci fi with just the perfect blend.  The actors and actresses all do an amazing job.  Joss should have dumped Fox in the dirt for daring to cancel this one.  I hope it comes back under a studio that appreciates what they have.
0790731894|4.0|Well, the dvd itself is not a big deal. There is no commentaries or special features. And it seems like they are not going to release special edition of this movie. The quality of the picture is really good. Just like film.<br />This movie is the only movie that has Steven Segal dies in the beginning...I was so surprised when I saw that happened. But this movie overall is fun and cool. Casting is just perfect. See for yourself.
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis is the best ever!! I've heard Oasis compared to the beatles, which I think is quite a stretch, but they are an awesome band on their own, even looking past the Beatlesque influence. The best songs on the album are Wonderwall, Champange Supernova, and Cast no Shadow. I esp. love the last like 2 minutes of Champange, but I have to say that the song is quite long. I wish that they could make music of the same calibur that they did in this album. EVERYONE SHOULD GO BUY THIS CD- NO MATTER IF YOU LISTEN TO RAP, PUNK, R&amp;B, OR WHATEVER!!
B00009XFYD|5.0|Jack's album On and On is one of the greatest cds I have ever bought. His lyrics are great flowing smoothly into the music. Great album...can't wait till his next.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The teaming and bonding of a group of soldiers under the most stressful and difficult circumstances captivates the viewer.  I lost all sense of time, worked out on a treadmill and watched it in sequences over time, and am not watching it straight through.  I feel that I was a part of EZ company, and continue to say that the men and women of war did a special and courageous thing for this generation and many more to follow.  To all of the director's, producers, and other professionals that created this, I tip my hat to your craft, however I pray and think daily of the people who allowed me to be blessed to live in the United States of America, a free man.  A must see for those who say that they are Americans, and proud of it.  A absolute see for those who question the brutality of evil dictator's like Hitler and other's.  All Sadam lovers, WATCH THIS FILM, and remain pensive.  THANKS EZ COMPANY!  May God Bless!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What an amazing show this was and could have been!  The DVD is even better- without losing the continuity to commercial interruption, I get completely transfixed by each brilliant episode.  Nobody does it better than Joss Whedon, and I think this cast was his stongest ever.  Again- this was a truly brilliant show!
B000000W5P|5.0|This album is unique in more ways than one.  When it first came out several celebrities were on the inside sleeve that showed through to the front.  Apparently, these people were not flattered and wanted their pictures removed.  &quot;Pardon our Appearance&quot; and &quot;Cover Under Reconstruction&quot; appeared inside the later copies.  I remember taking this album home and laying it on the turntable.  The first song, &quot;Miss You&quot;, came on.  I'd never heard it before.  I've listened to it countless times since and still think it's the best song on the album.  But every song on it is worthy of mention at least.  &quot;Far Away Eyes&quot; shows that the Stones could be a country band if they wanted to be.  &quot;Shattered&quot; is different than anything they've ever done.  &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot; is sung by Keith Richards, &quot;I wanna walk before they make me run&quot;, and he probably will.  The Stones were still young compared to now.  Probably nothing they would come out with now would sound as good as &quot;Some Girls&quot;.
B000089RVX|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD!!! I got this cd about a year ago, and it has almost never quit playing. This is a cd where you can listen to it over &amp; over again and you won't get tired of it. I can't wait until Evanescence comes out with a new cd. If you like hard rock with powerful lyrics Fallen is the CD for you.
6302256615|5.0|Patrick Swayze has to be the star of this show although Keanu Reaves plays a major roll.  Reaves plays Johnny Utah, a newly recruited FBI agent who is assigned to work with a partner:  Gary Busey.  Reaves want to catch &quot;The Ex-Presidents&quot;, four bank robbers who wear masks and have never been caught.  Busey thinks they are surfers and convinces Reaves of this belief.  Reaves goes undercover posing as a surfer without much success but eventually realizes who they are:  A group of guys led by Bodhi (Patrick Swayze).  Bodhi is a super cool guy who is a great surfer and very charismatic, even to Reaves.  But Reaves has a job to do.  And busting these guys isn't going to be easy.  The action in this show is superb.  Great surfing shots, but the best has to be the skydive near the end.  The bank robbery where Bodhi and his cohorts discover who Reaves really is has a great chase scene where Bodhi narrowly escapes from Utah (Reaves).  This show keeps picking up more and more momentum till the very end.  A show you will probably want to keep and watch more than a few times.  Reaves and Swayze are believable in their parts.  The second skydive at the end depicts two extreme personalities, each trying to out-daredevil the other, but not by design.

B0000C7PSW|1.0|This has to be one of the worst albums of the past year.  Everytime I hear any of it, I wonder how so many critics praise him as some sort of genius.  To me, he is just a Thom Yorke (Radiohead) wannabe singing pseudo lounge-music with unoriginal lyrics.  This album, praised by many as brilliant, sounds like nothing but an hour or so of droning by [someone who is] sub-par.  Maybe I'm missing something, but, working in a store where this is an in-store playlist album, I have heard it enough to figure that I'm probably not.
0920668364|5.0|My mother read this book to me as a child.  Even at such a young age I found it amazing how beautiful this book is and the sentiment that it puts forth.  Now I have my own daughter who is 18 months old and this book was at the top of our Christmas list.  To all of the people out there who read this book and think it is \\"sick\\" or \\"perverted\\" you are missing out on the true sentiment of this story,   I think it is beautiful and I cannot wait to share it with my daughter. I personally believe that it would be nice to be able to come out with two versions of this book, one where the main character for the book is a boy, and where one is a girl.  I cannot believe that anyone can read this book in anyway other than it being a  loving, positive, show of affection!  I look forward to cuddling with my daughter at night and reading it with her the same way my mother read it to me!
0385504209|5.0|What an amazing book. I literally read this book in less than two days. I only put the book down to eat, go to the bathroom, and to sleep. The book is an incredible mix of conspiracy and thrill. This book is recommended by me 110%. For anyone who loves religious conflict and conspiracy, this book is a must read.
B000084T18|1.0|50 Cent is a terrible rapper.  He has no talent.  Being shot 9 times is no excuse for sucking this bad.  He mumbles about who knows what but we can assume that hes saying how much money he has and using the &quot;n&quot; word every 5 seconds.  Do yourself a favor: save your money for real music.  If you're going to listen to rap listen to Atmosphere.
B00006ADG8|5.0|This is the most important film that I share with others.  Not only as shown by previous reviews does it show how human pragmatics in law and our attempts to design a just reality fail the ideals of humanity, but reveals a basic unavoidable contradiction with idealistic hope and pessimistic thought that are part of the reality we face.  Pragmatically, logically and leagally this is reavling portayal of the mechanics of existence. This movie seems to be a post modern quintessential.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Nothing compares to this brilliant work of art. This is one of those CD's that is a constant in your CD player. It has yet to come out of mine since I bought it on November 18th.

They're all available at Britneyforums.net<br />The Answer<BR>I've Just Begun<BR>Don't Hang Up<br />All are brilliant. Kudos Britney for going above and beyond my expectations for this CD.

0385504209|5.0|It's a great book to read. You have to take it with a grain of salt. Many of the things in the book might not be true, but at the end you just want them to be.
B00005JM0B|1.0|This movie sucks. It's a horrible parody of T2 and has nothing original in it whatsoever. Everything is taken from the first two flicks and given a 'spin' (not really) to make fresh. The humour is horrible and mocks the legacy of the two 'real' Terminator films. ie)Elton John shades on the Terminator.<br />The special effects were terrible CGI graphics (in the behind the scenes interview on the T2 DVD Stan Winston says the big problem with films today is all the computer effects - he uses them ONLY when they can't be done another way. But here it's ALL CGI all the time and it's all terrible.)<br />The uninventive story plods along, missing the boat in almost every scene. There's no real dramatic arc in this film and it completely misses the point of the second with its resonant theme of the value of human life. There are no such themes here -just boring, unimaginative action scenes that land with a dull thud.<br />I'm glad Arnie is now governor because he hasn't made a good movie in TEN YEARS.
B00005JMEW|3.0|3.5 stars. <BR>Its very hard to explain whats really going on in Tarantinos head. Even though I studied filmmaking, I dont like to critizice...making a movie is a very hard job and by I cant considered my self to make someone else movie better. I wont reviewed coz everybody elses have but there is some very positive elements you should keep in mind before viewing. For those of you who havent got the pleasure to experience asian cinema, you will find this movie as the most unique and creative motion picture alive...but its not. If you watch asian cinema you will see how much Tarantino takes from them and how little creative knowledge and originality he puts into his pictures. First of all the plot is very simple, a doublecross/revenge, almost every movie has the same plot...now lets give it something diferent and thats where those that have influenced Trantino come into the picture and I cant name a thousand...from Jackie Chan to Sonny Chiva to Gordon Liu to Sammo Hung etc. from Juen Woo Ping to John Woo to Wong Kar Wai to kitano and even the great takashi miike (best director alive)or even not asian directors like Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah. Now, Im not saying that being influenced by the great ones is wrong, not at all, but my argument is when you imitate something that has been done alot and make it a trade mark, like something taht should have your name coz you brought it up from the ashes. Here you have the best from, Battle Royale,tokio story, Ichi the Killer, Pistol Opera, Fireworks, A better Tomorrow, Master of the Flying Guillotine, Black Mask, dead or Alive, the Street Fighter, Iron Monkey, Yakusa films, blaxploitetion, Euro horror and so and so and so....this ceirtanly means that Tarantino is not someone who control the medium, but all the others I did mentioned do! A huge gap was the dialogue, it will never be as sharp as Reservoir or Pulp, he just cant handle it. Im not saying it is a bad movie, because its not..it was actually pretty entertaining but for me is just a sequel to someone elses great movie. So when you go see it, do not walk out saying is the most creative and original thing you have ever seen cause its not...but lets say is a good introduction and a great chance for the american public to see what Asian cinema can offer a million times better.
B000084T18|4.0|THIS WAS THE BREAKTHROUGH ALBUM FOR 50 CENT. AFTER  SURVIVING 9 BULLETS AND AFTER SPENDING 4 YEARS ON THE UNDERGROUND CIRCUIT, 50 FINALLY GETS HIS CHANCE TO SHINE WITH THIS ALBUM. ''MANY MEN'', ''DON'T PUSH ME'', ''P.I.M.P.'', ''GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN'', AND ''IF I CAN'T'' ARE MUST-HEAR SONGS. THOUGH THIS ALBUM IS A FAR CRY FROM 50'S MIXTAPE SONGS, THIS IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE BEST RAP ALBUMS OF THE YEAR. I DON'T CARE WHAT ANY RAP FAN MIGHT THINK, BUT THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN JA RULE'S NEWEST CD. I'D SAY THIS IS WORTH $14.00 THIS CD CONTAINS 3 BONUS TRACKS, INCLUDING ''WANKSTA''.
0553573403|5.0|Have a taste of this and many of the other fantasy series would start to taste like vinegar. The one thing that I really like about this book and subsequently, its series is that George did a good job getting his readers into the characters; very unlike many other fantasy series. You either come to love some of George's characters so much or hate some of them at the same time. The pace at which the story plods along is perfect and keeps you wanting for more. Excellent!
078324228X|4.0|A BOXER [DENZEL WASHINGTON] GETS ACCUSED OF MURDER AND IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRSON. THIS MOVIE, WHICH IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY, IS VERY POWERFUL. DENZEL WASHINGTON PUTS ON ONE OF THE GREATEST PERFORMANCES OF HIS ENTIRE CAREER. THE MOVIE EVEN HAS AN EMOTIONAL WAY OF TELLING HOW RUBIN ''HURRICANE'' CARTER WAS LATER FOUND INNOCENT AND WAS FREED. DENZEL WASHINGTON WAS REALLY ROBBED AT THE OSCARS FOR HIS POWERFUL PERFORMANCE IN THIS MOVIE. HE SHOULD'VE GOTTEN THE AWARD FOR BEST ACTOR.  CAUSE AIN'T NOBODY ELSE DO A BETTER ACTING JOB THAT YEAR. BUT DON'T WORRY, WE ALL KNOW WHO WAS THE TRUE BEST ACTOR. AND WE ALL KNOW WHY HE DIDN'T WIN. YOU NEED TO SEE THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Look, i dont really care about what other people think about LP as a band, as long as i am happy with what they make, me being a fan of the band and all. You can't even begin to compare the band to Metallica, that band is in whole other context than Linkin Park is, im a big fan of RATM also, so i know where Linkin Park got their initial inspiration from. They show a heavy resemblance of this band, but only in the instrumental form but where RATM made a in-your-face sort of rock, LP transforms that in-your-face into art-for-who-loves-it and who really care about the music they listen to. I see no reason at all to be overly critical about this album, offcourse its not nearly as swift and easy to listen to as Hybrid Theory, and offcourse its corporate, but hey, allmost everything's corporate hell even RATM was corperate. But its amazing how LP managed to slip so much emotion into these corperate recordings right, why not see it from the bright side? I love their artistic form of songwriting and the SLOPPIENESS just adds to this form, i bet my life on it that Mike and Chester just do this on purpose, portraying the heavily embedded feelings in their songs, its the sloppieness of life thats being told. And i love every single bit of all their songs, but aruguably, With You is my favorite song, but this just changes from time to time, thats the power of Linkin Park, its your mood that empowers their music.
B00004STUL|4.0|DRUGS ARE STOLEN FROM A POLICE EVIDENCE ROOM, AND TWO COPS [WILL SMITH AND MARTIN LAWRENCE] ARE ASSIGNED TO INVESTIGATE THE REASONS BEHIND THIS.

B00005NB0H|5.0|Catching a great band at the top of their game, Live At Leeds is unsurpassed in the annals of concert recordings - the gold standard by which others should be measured. On an average night The Who would reach musical (and decibel) levels other bands could only dream of. On a particulary inspired occasion like this one they were untouchable (Pete later remarked &quot;I can only remember concentrating very hard&quot;). With a distinctly percussive yet melodic sound all their own, they blaze a trail here that will leave the listener wowed by the sonic energy coming from those famous Hi Watt amps. <br />Buy this CD, enjoy it, and marvel at how essentially 3 soloists and Rock's best singer could meld together to produce some of the best rock 'n roll ever.
B000002BBY|4.0|I dont think you Americans realise what an impact this album had on British society, fashion, culture and even Tony Blair. Noel's undoubted talent in songwriting and coming up with catchy heavy riffs that could match a lot of high quality records. <BR>Oasis stumbled at the next album however, in my opinion because they didn't change their tune, they had no Sgt Peppers, Led Zepp III etc etc.<BR>They stuck with the same ingrediants without even mixing them. <BR>At the time this was the best record for a very very long time, then came the Bends however, but thats another story......
B0000DCGT0|5.0|When my wife and I got into the DVD of what we had read, it was beyond our wildest dreams! As the young son of Charles wrecked his new Buick Roadster, our thots turned to our young grandson, who met his death at his battle with Chemo, Leukemia. As we spun into that story with beautiful, mystical horses, we wished for some magical way to have Sir Christopher,in the Spirit, watching with us!     Only if you could see Christopher with Horses and his big black Newfoundland, Hershey, many times curled up in a blanket with his pet, losing his own head of hair, cracking jokes about \\"when I become old enuf to be a real-life Vetenarian\\" could you then be able to understand. But Christopher would rejoice in those super victoriea of the \\"little lead pony\\" who fought his battles to become Winner of the Match Race with War Admiral.     When you behold the trio of inspired riders and owners acted by Toby Macguire, Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges...you too will be brought to the edge of your recliner shouting and yelling like I did! There were races as in full-view, thrilling to compete with Saratoga Springs, being watched by violinists of Philadelphia Orchestra on a summer afternoon! They are always awesome!     As we recovered, our thots agreed \\"if only Christopher can see these gorgeous, thorough-bred animals in action...\\"    Retired Chaplain Fred W. Hood
0553213105|4.0|Pride and Prejudice was such a delight to read.  Anybody who enjoys reading will love the book.  Its tales of love and money will grab and hold your attention.  The author's use of conflict between her characters is marvelously done.  Conflict was a literary device I appreciated from the book.  It brings interest, excitement and wonder to the story.<br /> A favorite chapter of mine would have to be chapter nineteen.  Austen's portrait of Mr. Collin is solidified in this chapter.  The manner in which he proposed to Elizabeth was a prime example of his pompous nature.<br /> Pride and Prejudice is a light-hearted and romantic book.  I would recommend the book to any teenager or adult.  Its topics are very relatable to both age groups.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|I cannot believe how much they managed to throw into this box set....  <br />As a fan of the Alien \\"Quadrilogy,\\" this is the ultimate service.  All four films, in both original theatrical and extended director's cut/special edition versions.  The extras discs are amazing.  I haven't watched every possible thing to watch on them.  It's like attempting to watch all the extras on the old \\"T2: Ultimate Edition DVD\\" in one sitting.  <br />Even though I've seen each movie scores of times (with the exception of the ho-hum Alien 3), the DVD transfers are just awesome.  Especially the transfer of Alien.  Amazingly crisp and clean.  <br />The new cut of Alien 3 doesn't make up for the theatrical release or make it \\"good;\\" it's simply interesting.  <br />The reasons this set gets only four out of five stars are 1.) the awkward and flimsy packaging, 2.) the sound, which is a tad disappointing and 3.) not getting any real insight into the mess that was Alien 3 in the extras for that film.  From what I understand, the behind-the-scenes footage is heavily edited (not to mention an MIA David Fincher; no commentaries or anything).  <br />Other than that, flawless!  <br />To address the \\"locking up\\" issue some people seem to have:<br />Are you using your PlayStation 2 as your primary DVD player?  I do and Alien locked up on me at exactly the same spot another reviewer mentioned.  Since some DVDs have a tendancy of skipping/locking up on the PS2, I always run \\"problem\\" DVDs through my alternate player, which is in my PC.  After running the DVD from where it erred on my PS2, it continued on smoothly and without fail.  So, if you are using your PS2 to run the DVDs either attempt to rectify the problem by installing the new media drivers that come with the official Sony PS2 Remote (which I do not have and may not work) or watch them with another DVD player.
0380713802|5.0|This may be the most funny book I've ever read. The best way to experience it is to have a glass of wine and read it aloud with a friend - certain parts will have you rolling. Seriously, it also turned out to be the most helpful book I had when I did my backpacking tour through Europe. His observations are not only hilarious but dead-on accurate most of the time. Visiting some of the out-of-the-way places he did will make your trip all the better, whether you agree with him or not. It's certainly possibly to satirize a place you love, as Bryson obviously does in all his books.
B000059H98|3.0|Hear ye, hear ye! Malcolm McDowell proves downright luscious in &quot;Tank Girl&quot; - when doesn't he - but the story is moderately bearable, having amusing characters and outrageous costumes.  One thing I wasn't happy with was the fact that there. are. absolutely. NO extra features aside from trailers, which was extremely disappointing!!!!  I know that there must be outtakes and interviews somewhere, but why they weren't included on the DVD remains a mystery worthy of Mulder and Scully.
0783233477|5.0|I'll admit that only morbid curiosity led me to watch this movie upon it's initial release.  The premise of this remake sounded interesting, but the over the top costs and production problems had been tabloid fodder for months. When it didn't do blockbuster business, not many people were surprised.<br />It's a shame that this movie didn't do better than mediocre reviews and lukewarm boxoffice receipts. There I sat in the audience marveling at the gorgeous design and antiques, not to mention the exquisite costume design. So many films these days go for established designers, but this movie used a studio designer much like the days of the old Hollywood system. The attention to detail is exquisite.<br />As for the acting, it all boiled down to one scene for me.  Anthony Hopkins describing the first time he'd ever had a lamb sandwich to Brad Pitt. It turns into one of the most beautiful remembrance speeches of a widower for the wife he still grieves.  Needless to say even this heartless cynic got a bit misty. To have a man express such love without sounding condescending or corny is quite a feat. It's enough to make you believe in the power of a good actor.<br />Brad Pitt also deserves kudos for this role. Despite living through a personal hell and sustaining an injury, he does a great job in his double role.  I thought the scene in which Death says good bye to Claire Forlani's character was some of his best acting.
B000088E6D|5.0|At this day and age when you think teenagers are succumbing to punkish mindless melodies, some others out there may be snapping their fingers to a different tune. As a 16-year-old, I have a varied taste in music, and my latest discovery is Michael Bubl. He makes a refreshing spin on all-time oldie favorites! Bubl's got a wonderful voice which can make you feel all pleasant. And he's not only good for looks, nor charm, but how he delivers his vocal talent. I recommend you listen to the whole album, with amazing versions of &quot;Sway&quot;, &quot;Moondance&quot;, and &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot;. After listening, I'm sure you'd appreciate Granpa's music... with a new twist.
B000002LEU|4.0|I really liked New Order, so I thought their former assemblage would be a similarly dancable group. I was devastated when the songs on this CD were so dark, brooding, and punk-influenced. I was expecting some bouncy synthesizer pop.  Other than \\"love will tear us apart\\" i thought the cd was really hard to listen to.<br />For some reason I kept listening, and I soon found that this dark stuff was really powerful; nowadays I hardly go a week without listening to some JD. \\"Transmission\\"  \\"She's Lost Control\\" and \\"Dead Souls\\" are always good.  My favorite string of songs, however, is at the very end with \\"novelty\\" \\"komakino\\" and \\"these days\\" closing out the cd.<br />In summation, you have to give it some time, and you have to get into the Joy Division mood in order to truly enjoy Substance.  It's like a hidden treasure that you have dig for, but once you discover the poignance in Joy Division, you'll know it was worth the effort.
0385720920|4.0|This is my second time reading a Palahniuk novel, and I have to say that he is quickly becoming one of my favorite satirical writers.  In Choke, Palahniuk has a main character who goes to sex addiction 12 step programs to pick up chicks (they don't get much easier than that!) and fakes choking in restaurants so that someone will rescue him, feel sorry for him, and hopefully give him some money.  The lead character also spends his days debating on whether or not to sleep with the female doctor at his aged mother's nursing home and flashing back through his bizarre childhood with his crazy mother.  In other words, this is your typical, outlandish Palahniuk plot (for which we all know and love him).<br />As always, Palahniuk uses his fun, crazy, satirical plot to delve into issues of importance to modern people.  In this particular book, he deals with addiction and the need for people to feel important, even god-like, in the face of a society that has made so many people feel that their lives are completely unnecessary.  The lead character and his crew strive throughout the book to find a meaning to their lives, lives in which they feel completely unimportant as they work as strippers and theme park characters.  Whether or not these characters consciously realize it, they are all abusing themselves in some form or another because they need some way, some sort of outlet, to get through a world that doesn't seem to really need them.  The lead character's crazy mother points out that with all the laws, regulations, rules, and safety precautions forced upon society in modern days, life on earth has become more like a big trip on a giant cruise ship.  Everybody does what they are supposed to do at the appointed time, and things keep moving smoothly along.  People are made to feel that the most important thing that they can contribute to society is to conform to it so that it continues to work as a well-oiled machine.  As Palahniuk lets you know, this is not exactly healthyfor an individual's psyche.  So, you get the addictive behaviors, aimlessness, and general psychoses that seems to affect so many in our generation. Palahniuk's characters spend the book trying to resolve this issue in their own lives.<br />The underlying message of this book really spoke to me, while the plot and characters kept me entertained.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes good social satire.
B00005JM02|5.0|It seems there are hardly any good movies these days. The reviews keep getting better and better and the movies keep getting worse and worse. I'm very strict on the media I allow into my house. For this reason, my kids hardly watch any movies. Movies without good characters or a plot will not keep their attention. This movie is fun to watch - it has an amusing cast of characters and the journey to reunite father and son is funny, funny, funny. My kids love this movie - especially the part when Dori is speaking &quot;whale.&quot; This is one kids movie my husband and I can actually watch and enjoy.
B00005JM02|1.0|I could barely stay awake for Finding Nemo. I doubt kids will get anything out of this for a lesson other than perseverence pays off, and maybe don't wander off without your parent's permission. Other than that the plot was flat and geared toward parents more than kids, the characters tried to be funny but weren't, and some of the sequences were too intense for my 3.5 year old. This is one of the first movies he did not say AGAIN! immediately after viewing it... and I don't blame him.       Other movies he loved: Spirit, Lion King, Bugs Life, Piglets Big Movie, and any of the Veggie Tales short features.       Yes, the animation is superb from Pixar, as always, but that's all I'll give it. Some friends who loved the movie immediately ran out and bought the DVD and lent it to us, so at least I saw it for free. I was dreading the question, how did you like it?. I simply said I liked Bugs Life and the Toy Stories better. Bugs Life and Toy Story are still, in my opinion the two movies by which all recent Pixar films should be measured against.       Monsters Inc... ehh. Finding Nemo... blah.       My advice, rent before you buy this movie. Some people really liked it... I'm not sure why.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|Thanks, guys, for the deSpectorized version of these performances. The sound quality is phenomenal, really, and the stripped-down versions of most of the songs sound fantastic.
0393051587|5.0|Simply amazing! That is the best description I can give of this version of Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot;<br />How many times have you ever read this wonderful novel, but overlooked many parts because it may have seemed long-winded, or maybe you just didn't quite understand the Victorian language that Dickens used (and why wouldn't he?)? Being a student of Dickensian England, this book thoroughly explains every minute detail of the time period in which this story takes place (1843) through the story itself. So much so that, in fact, that after completing this encyclopedia (for it truly is an encyclopedia), I felt as if I understood completely what the readers of the time of Dickens must have felt after reading the first edition 160 years ago. Words, sentences, phrases - all explained desciptively so as one now knows what Dickens actually meant when writing them. It opened my eyes much wider to the WHOLE story, not just the fluff we've all come to know. And, as mentioned in other reviews, you get the complete original novel as well as the 'reading to the public' version, along with a very informative introduction.<br />I have reviewed several different &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; books - all of which are excellent in their own right. But this version, however simply put, takes the cake!
B000001EKX|4.0|\\"Hotter than hell\\" is Kiss' second album and it is without doubt a very good one and a worthy follow up to the debut. It's just too bad that the production isn't at all comparable to the quality in material, and even after a remastering, \\"Hotter than hell\\" sounds muddy, and blurry. But the songs are very good to say the least. Kiss did a good job in writing these tunes that do not melt together since almost every one has originality and is able to stand on its own. The title track is the most known but I think there are others that are even better. At this time, Gene Simmons seemed to actually care about the music and his \\"Going blind\\" and \\"Watching you\\" are excellent. Ace Frehley wrote two hard and heavy pieces by the name of \\"Strange ways\\" (thankfully sung by Peter Criss), and \\"Parasite\\" (sung by Simmons). Other stand out songs are the melodic and catchy \\"Mainline\\" and \\"Comin' home\\". In my opinion this album is clearly worth having and you do not have to be a hardcore Kiss' fan to appreciate \\"Hotter than hell\\". When Kiss were about to record later albums like \\"Animalize\\" or \\"Lick it up\\" I wish they had listened to this effort and hopefully realized how good music is created.
B000069CWE|5.0|this is the best album that Linkin Park has put out yet. The first was too repedative and Meteora has too soft and the new live cd wasn't polished enough. Mind u the dvd was good but reanimation by far surpasses it. It combines Mike Shinoda and Mr. Haun's talents with the dgital sound, adding a new flavor to the (as i said) too repedative songs on Hybrid Theory. the guest artists also change the songs for the better. With u and By Myself and Forgetten r probably the best songs on the cd and the new songs like X-ecutioner style, My December and High Voltage rn't too far behind.So, all the people that don't like this cd is full of sh*t and those who do like it, i give u props because u know good music.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I'm an old school Chili fan from back in the day (Hi Anthony), and I must say they still got it! And this DVD shows it. This DVD captures the experience of their live shows to a T. Buy it!
B00005JM02|5.0|Two words. Just great. most everyone thinks so and i agree with them. Fantastic animation, plot, characters, and jokes. I was very suprised that most of the jokes were for older people, like teens and adults. ( my 7 yr old brother didnt even know what e-bay was...) I watch this over and over again. All of the major critics say its great, i say its great. What more do you want?<BR>I espically liked when before the movie started, disney had previews of &quot;brother bear&quot; and the moose was commenting that the people that were &quot;leaving&quot; were &quot;going to find that nemo&quot; Hey, what can i say? it was pretty funny timing considering that &quot;brother bear&quot; was a piece of crap. And I also love the short film, kcick knack. I also enjoy when the DVD comes out, Pixar leaves you in suspence by showing you a preview of their next movie. In this case its &quot;the incredibles&quot; which looks very funny. I also have been hearing some rumors of the the NEXT movie after that. &quot;Cars&quot; i think it was. I will be very intrested to see what they make out of that =)
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I've been listening to Enigma since the beginning and think this is a great 5th work to bear the Enigma name. I've read a lot of the reviews here out of curiousity (I had the cd before checking to see what other people thought of it) and have to say that a lot of the reviews/opinions that portray Voyager in a negative or disappointing light are a bit too narrow minded (in my opinion). The only complaint I have, is that I feel the cd is just too short at ~45 minutes - it should have been an hour. The Enigma feel is definitely still present, but in a different way. The arrangements are a bit more sparse and more rhythmic in nature (in a slightly funkier way). I like this new(ish) direction  - it's good to see some evolution and change in sound (but not a complete switch). I've immensely enjoyed the previous 4 Enigma cd's, but am glad this cd didn't come out as more of the same. I understand an artists desire to not keep rehashing the same sound everytime. Let the music speak for itself and let Voyager stand on it's own -  don't try to make it fit into your expectations of the Enigma sound based on what has come before. If you look at it that way, you probably will be disappointed.
B00005YUPO|5.0|Baby Bach is my baby's favorite!!!  The colorful toys set to music really holds his attention.  A must for any parent!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Quite possibly the best science fiction show on television. The science was subtly understated in that it doesn't hit you in the face but you catch a glimpse of something really high-tech and cool  every once in a while. The fiction was top-notch with real human emotions and stories that actually dealt with the characters (instead of mostly external entities and aliens in that other unnammed sci-fi franchise) If firefly were playing today, it would be my favorite show since Buffy is now gone. I am very unhappy that it was cancelled even after all this time. In fact, Firefly was quite possibly the best television show on television. If I can't have you I can at least have your DVD!
B00007E8V4|4.0|First of i heard got Toxicity from a friend and i loved the album so naturally got this album. a lot of people they didnt like this album because it was as good. I agree to some extent i did think toxicity was better but its not like i dont listen to this album. I thought for some reason this album was a lot more political than the other one. I actually agree with their politics was maybe a big reason i liked the album. Maybe the most influential song is &quot;N-Guns&quot;. It was such an angry album but it amde a lot of sense. You should buy this if your looking for stripped down angry rock
B0000C6E4D|2.0|A personal quirk of mine is to read album credits. In this latest offering the artist acknowledges her husband & daughter in glowing terms.<br />SO WHY NOT SOME UPLIFTING TUNES?<br />Jeez, if this CD had a few more of the typical SM fair of \\"I'm just a mixed up, confused, heart-broken, relationship-scarred woman trying not to screw up my life further\\" I would have tossed it out. It's been a while since I actually wished an album would end. Thank goodness this one was a tad over 40 minutes.<br />Now if my sister will accept this CD as a Christmas present & not notice that it's been opened...
B0000DYJM6|5.0|By the time i got this cd i was a huge fan PJ already so i knew this was going to be great. I was dead right this album is incredible. The most incredible thing about this album is that you would think this album was a compilation of different bands. I mean It stretches acrosss all of pearl jams lengthy music span. From the earliest recordings to the newest ones. And there is great songs from each time zone. The best track might even be the hidden track &quot;4/20/02&quot; ive not heard such anger in ed since a long time. I think its a must have especially if youve never heard Pearl Jam
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I was astonished when I first listened to this album, britney did an amazing job, and whoever said this was a flop, GET A LIFE, it has already been certified 2 times platinum after just a month in stores, and is one of the best selling albums around the world these days, that is what I called a HIT, by the way &quot;Me against the music&quot; has been number 1 in more than 10 countries, and the video has been #1 on TRL for the last weeks, way to go! britney, and to all of you, BUY IT, you wont regret.
B000002H6C|5.0|Ive heard of metallica of course and ive listened to enter sandman on radio but i wasnt really impressed the first time i really got interested in them is when i watched the video of &quot;One&quot; and i saw Krik Hammet's guitar solo i needed to get this album. WOW! Musical talent everywhere. A lot people say they dont like the long songs i disagree i love them. As a drummer Lras Ulrich got me in to Double bass drumming. This concept meant nothing to me until i heard &quot;Dyer's Eve&quot;. even though i wasnt really impressed with vocals i think the talent these guys put on is hard to match
B00003JA8H|2.0|I have read many of the reviews of this movie/DVD and I think every single one of you who rate this movie above a 3 have probably not seen the actual production and are very VERY ignorant<br />I was in the Toronto production of Joseph with Donny Osmond in 1997 (I performed in the last live show he ever performed) and this movie sucks.  There will never be a better Pharoh as Jonny Seaton.  Also, in the live production the wigs and makeup actually looked real.  Donny IS Joseph for all you people who thought his performance was lacking (I performed with two different actors playing that role, and saw several others believe me I know!)  Since there is no intermission in the video I understand why thy had to cut the entreact, but the key ingredient which would have made this video is the Megamix.  In the live production the megamix was a crazy dance partyish thing that had highlights of every song in the show (the megamix was used for curtain calls) and it was one of my favourite parts of the show!!!  Also, the children played a much bigger role in the stage production.  I also felt the singing wasn't as good as I had hoped.  Another point is the moments of humour created between the conducter and the brothers during canan days is missing.  I believe what made this movie draggy and boring was the fact that it wasn't taped live - You have prerecorded music which you are lip syncing too, there is no way you could possible have the same energy and expression as when you are doing it live.  This movie was just lacking the Theatre charm.  Personally, those of you who like this movie fine, like it, but I wish this was just a tape of a performance - sure there's no flashy special effects but at least it would be the production as most of us theatre people love.<br />P.s. I would have given this movie a rating of 1 star, but a bad movie is better than no movie!!<br />And just a quick reply to a review I read: for your information Any Dream Will Do is suppose to be at the beginning, not the end.  The ending version is a reprise - don't be ignorant.
B0000027RL|5.0|Ive heard of pearl jam and i never really heard any of their songs. Then one day i heard Jeremy play on a stereo somewhere and it was at the end part where eddie is just screaming his lungs out. I didnt what he was singing about but i just felt him right there. Then i downloaded Oceans 'Unplugged' and i was hooked i bought ten and never looked back. This is seriousely one of the greatest albums i think i will ever listen to i dont have a favorite song because it changes everyday. there good songs in every spectrum of music. they dont just play the same kind of songs over and over. and adding to that every one of the band members are incredible muscianists. take it from me this album rocks
B000003AE8|5.0|From the greastest of all time. Show s up biggie smallz. No wonder he has sold more than any other rap artist check this out
B000021YQV|4.0|This is possibly my favorite post 2000 band. I mean it is the best metal gets. Its political, hard and down right cool. John Dolmayan one of the coolest drummers makes me proud to be a drummer. Some of the songs were just funny little songs and some of them were angry rock and some of them were just memorable. but i still wish there was osme way to put it all together
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is a very good mystery/thriller, tying many historical facts and historical theories together in a modern background.  Politics, religion, deceit, international intrigue, all rolled together in a compelling story.  There are many unexpected twists and turns in the plot, and the reader never knows what will happen next.  The book is hard to put down, and the characters are believable and likeable.  A highly recommended book.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I bought this album because i heard Weak and Powerless and I was intrigued...i own the first album and really love it...so i figured i would probably like this one too...well, when i first listened to the cd, i was a little confused. it sounded nothing like the first one...and it was a very odd combination of musical notes and ideas that at first i just couldnt understand enough to like...but then, as it kept playing in the background, i just developed a respect for it, and eventually grew to love it. Pet is an amazing song. the build ups are energizing. all in all i love this cd.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Like the Extended Edition for \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", this Extended Edition expands upon the version of \\"The Two Towers\\" that was presented in the theaters.  There is approximately 40 minutes of additional material woven back into the movie.  The most important (and the most effective) additional scenes are the ones that involve Faramir.  One of the complaints some people had about \\"The Two Towers\\" was that in the book Faramir was pure of heart and was not tempted by the ring at all.  In the movie, his character was changed so that he was a real threat to Frodo's journey.  Faramir's additional scenes explain his motivation towards the Ring and why he behaves the way he does.  There are also flashbacks with Boromir, more scenes with the Ents, and the additional scenes make for a richer Lord of the Rings experience.<br />There are also two discs of bonus material to supplement the film.  Some of these bonus documentaries are very similar to those from the \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" DVD.  The similar documentaries have material specific to \\"The Two Towers\\", but it covers the same topics as those from \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\".  Examples of these documentaries are the ones on \\"Weta Workshop\\", \\"Bigatures\\", and \\"The Atlas of Middle Earth\\".  There are also documentaries that are completely new.  One of my favorites is the documentary about adapting the book into a screenplay.  This documentary showed how Peter Jackson had to make decisions about what to include in the film, what scenes and characters to cut, and why certain changes had to be made (Jackson gives a very good explanation for Faramir's change).  The other major documentary was about Gollum.  Gollum was a character on whom the success of the entire series hinged.  If he was poorly animated or wasn't believable, \\"The Two Towers\\" would ultimately fail as a film (and this would also bring down \\"The Return of the King\\").  The Gollum documentary shows how Gollum was created, and exactly how much work went into making the character look so well on the screen.  It also shows just how important Andy Serkis was in creating the character.  He was a lot more than a voice actor, he was the character actor for Gollum.<br />Just as the Extended Cut of \\"Fellowship\\" was essential viewing for fans of Lord of the Rings, so is the Extended Cut of \\"The Two Towers\\".  While these additional scenes didn't complete the film in the way that those from \\"Fellowship\\" did, they do make \\"The Two Towers\\" a better movie.nto making the character look so well on the screen.

B00008H2LB|5.0|You know something, people are always overly critical of very popular bands and that's understandable.  However, this is one band with which I can find no real complaints.  I like almost every song of theirs cept maybe two, but even those are good in and of themselves.  My favorites are Crawling, In the End, With You, Breaking the Habit, Don't Stay, Faint, Numb, Figure.09, Pts.of.Athrty, Paper Cut, Hit the Floor, Easier to Run, and Runaway.  As you can see, I'm an avid fan. To me, the category into which they should be classified is of no concern, and I can think of no other band that they really and truly classify with, since they are extremely distinguishable.  As for the technicalities of their music, I don't give a f***, I just know I really enjoy their music, short or not, and I will continute to listen to them.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|For those with lives, &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; is too massive to be experienced in full -- it's a black hole from which no free time can escape. The behemoth stands at the intersection of video obsession and science-fiction geekdom, a space nearly as creepy as any visited in the films. Not scared off? Climb aboard -- here's one long strange trip worth taking.<br />DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika (&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;) has pulled together a quarter century's worth of &quot;Alien&quot; matter -- outtakes, production clips, art elements, promo materials, etc. -- somehow emerging with a coherent package. Some elements return from the series' fairly ambitious video past, but much of the content is new or unseen.<br />The set's backbone is what amounts to a 12-hour documentary, carved up into digestible segments of about three hours (and then again into featurettes, if the viewer chooses that navigation option). De Lauzirika weaves a tale populated by a Shakespearean cast of heroes, villains and martyrs, most of whom have their say in new interviews. Even the DVD docu itself is not without drama -- De Lauzirika pulled his name from the piece on &quot;the tragedy of Alien 3&quot; after the studio removed some of the more volatile material about the shoot.<br /><br />In addition to great-looking versions of the four original theatricals, &quot;Quadrilogy&quot; streams in alternate versions of the films, basically director's cuts, three of them new to home video. The directors briefly introduce the rearranged movies, and join key cast and crew members in new commentaries. Only director David Fincher of &quot;Alien 3&quot; is missing in action, a shame because his film went through the most radical renovation.<br />The &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; layout gives viewers a fighting chance, with a logical and uniform approach to content. Menus look good (and creepy), with little guesswork required. (Unfortunately, there's no main onscreen index.) Each title takes up two discs: one for the film(s) and another for bonus materials. A ninth DVD does clean-up with trailers and such. The films' release dates crack open a few Easter Eggs.p two discs: one for the film(s) and another for bonus materials.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Although I initially felt as if this recording was hopelessly dated as soon as it landed (since it contained so many early 80's post punk clichés), I have grown to love it as a brilliant continuation of the new wave `tradition'. It certainly is a step up from the Strokes and other pop neo-new wave wannabes. <br />Many references have rightly been made to borrowing from Joy Division's style. Another reference point that is equally apt is the chiming, ethereal and unique pop of the group, Breathless who have been making remarkable records for over 18 years now. The beautiful textured layers, Jim Morrison-like baritone and unique lyrics make Interpol one of last year's great finds.
B000006NUW|5.0|Don't get me wrong, this set of CD's is unbelievable.  After you know the story of the infamous Funk Brothers, its hard to keep a dry eye listening to the infallable funky beat of the Motown sound.  Unfortunately, while this collection picks up some of my all time favorites (like the Originals, &quot;Baby, I'm for Real&quot;), there are others that didn't make the cut (Marvin Gaye's &quot;Hitchhike&quot;, amoung others).  So what this collection really serves as is a whetting of the appetite, a reminder of what music used to be, a taste of honey if you will....when music kept your foot tapping and your soul full of hope.  What today's generation has done to music is absolutely criminal.  Thin, vapid and useless.  Do yourself a favor.  Even though this is just enough to get the taste in your mouth, dab your finger in the honey jar and get this CD collection. You'll come to realized that despite all the flaws behind the scenes, Motown produced the groove that carried the world through the heartache of the Vietnam War, JFK's assassination and the end of our innocence.
0060930187|5.0|The bell jar by the highly acclaimed writer, Sylvia Plath -who is famous for her number of poems- is one of my favourite books. It is a dark and rather disturbing novel; autobiographical to some extent and provides an insight to her and her feelings in a metaphor. <br />You will be empathetic towards the narrator and main character, Esther Greenwood, a young adult who succeeds her way into university in New York. At the beginning, she was ambitious and witty, and like Plath, Esther is an excellent writer. In the summer of her 19 years, she works as a junior magazine editor at her internship and she introduces her friends and many situations that contribute to her final breakdown, as she gradually declines to insanity as she feels being trapped in the bell jar. She is later admitted to a mental institution, where she'll shares her experiences with you. The rest you'll have to find out. <br />The book jumps from time to time where she'll recall past events abruptly, this was quite confusing, but after the first couple times, I got the hang of it. There are some humour in this book that breaks the ice, mainly a bit of dark humour once a while. I thought the ending was rather ironic, as after a month of the book being published, Plath had committed suicide...<br />Plath's poetic language and technique is what makes this novel unique, her ability to describe the details of a situation with similes and put every word together that made it so honest and real. She was able to convey the images and feelings of Esther and lets you in her world to portray mental instability. I also found it hard to separate Esther from the author of the book. This book evoked strong feelings from me when I read it. It is an emotional story and can somewhat be life-altering.
B000083E79|4.0|I agree with the previous reviewer in that a two-disc set would have been more appropriate for &quot;the very best of Cher.&quot; After all, the woman has been making music for four decades.  And there are some big hits missing here.  I'm a little surprised that &quot;The Way Of Love,&quot; &quot;Love And Understanding&quot; and &quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot; - all top 20 hits which were included on IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME: CHER'S GREATEST HITS - didn't make it to this collection, while other songs which failed to hit the top 40 (i.e. &quot;One By One&quot;) or failed to chart altogether (i.e. &quot;All Or Nothing&quot;) did.  I also would have liked more Sonny &amp; Cher material, although I appreciate the fact that this collection included more than one S&amp;C song (this one has both &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; and &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;; only the former was on IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME) and also includes a few of Cher's '60s solo hits which were also missing from IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME (which had her 1987 remake of &quot;Bang Bang,&quot; but not the 1966 original).  That said, what is here is first-rate.  On every song, Cher proves that she is THE diva.  There's no mistaking that voice, whether it's the sweet, sassy, sort of girlish voice on &quot;All I Really Want To Do&quot; (which hit the charts when she was 18) or the older, more soulful, well-cured Cher of &quot;Song For The Lonely.&quot; I also like the way this CD is kind of presented thematically - first we get her power-ballad days of the late '80s and early '90s, then on to the late '90s and the new millennium with Cher the dance diva, followed by her 1979 disco smash &quot;Take Me Home&quot; and a remake of an oldie (&quot;The Shoop Shoop Song&quot;) followed by the real oldies of Cher's career from the '60s and '70s, ending with &quot;A Different Kind Of Love Song&quot; &quot;dedicated to everyone.&quot; It's not ALL of Cher's very best, but it does prove that she can sing anything and singit well - folk-rock, adult contemporary, power ballads, techno-dance.  &quot;Just Like Jesse James&quot; is even more than a little country-flavored, and I'm surprised it wasn't covered for the country market - I think it could have been a big hit.  Perhaps someday there will be a TRUE best-of box set encompassing ALL of her hits, but until then, this compilation is a fine overview of the career of the greatest diva ever.  Well done Cher (but let me say that I don't believe for a minute that her last tour was her &quot;farewell&quot; tour; she'll be back).

B000051VWW|5.0|True, the voice sounds a little older and deeper, true, the saxophones that graced DIAMOND LIFE and PROMISE are gone, but Sade's trademark is still there: soft, sweet, elegant and romantic music, powered by her beautiful melodies and lifted by her unique, understated yet expressive vocals.  Most of these songs are powered by a gentle, soft acoustic guitar rather than a sax and jazz drumming, but that gives LOVERS ROCK a warm, romantic quality - perfect for snuggling up in a comforter with a mug of hot cocoa on a cold winter's night.  I've heard Sade's sound described as &quot;aural comfort food,&quot; and I think that sums it up nicely.  As in the past, Sade's lyrics aren't exactly Nobel Prize-winning poetry, but are lifted and given new meaning by her voice and her backing band.  Favorite tracks: the title song, &quot;King Of Sorrow,&quot; &quot;All About Our Love,&quot; &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart,&quot; and &quot;Immigrant&quot; (a simple yet moving song about the pain of racial prejudice).
B0000DD7NL|5.0|As a fan of r&amp;b music, I can say that too many r&amp;b artists and groups make a nice debut CD and then they think just because that CD was successful that 10 months later they can release another CD right away.  What comes to mind off the top of my head was India Arie whose &quot;Voyage To India&quot; definitely wasn't as good as &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot;.  There is nothing wrong with taking some time to tour and to just take a break in general before you make another CD.   &quot;The Diary Of Alicia Keys&quot; proves this theory.  The second time around is just as good as the first time for Alicia Keys.  Many people felt that &quot;Songs In A Minor&quot; was overrated and didn't deserve the critical acclaim that the CD achieved.  However, I will put &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, &quot;Troubles&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye&quot; against pretty much any of the latest r&amp;b artists' songs and those songs will come out on top.   <br />In my opinion, &quot;The Diary Of Alicia Keys&quot; isn't that much different from &quot;Songs In A Minor&quot;.  Everything is just presented at an even better level.   My favorite song so far is clearly &quot;Karma&quot;.  Just as &quot;Girlfriend&quot; was for &quot;Songs In A Minor&quot;, &quot;Karma&quot; is Ms. Keys ode to hip hop as she basically tells a former lover that sooner or later you will regret the way you treated the relationship and karma always comes back to hit you two or three times harder.   &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot; is my favorite slow jam from this CD as Alicia sounds like she has dedicated this to her long time partner in music and in life, Kerry Brothers.   Although this slow jam doesn't come close to the magic that &quot;Butterflyz&quot; created, &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot; is still a nice slow, love jam.   &quot;Diary&quot; which features Tony Toni Tone and Stokely from Mint Condition on background vocals, rounds out my Top 3 of favorite songs so far.   Alicia is trying to let this person know that she canbe trusted and if there are secrets or things that he doesn't want anyone else to find out, that she will keep them to herself.   The first single, &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;, sounds like a tribute to the old school as Kanye West assists on the production.  The A&amp;R earned their paycheck by choosing this song as the first single and this is one reason why &quot;The Diary Of Alicia Keys&quot; sold over 600,000 units in its first week.  &quot;If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By&quot; is another tribute to the old school as Easy Mo Bee who used Isaac Hayes' &quot;Walk On By&quot; for The Notorious BIG's &quot;Warning&quot; does the same for this song with an assist by Dwayne Wiggins from Tony Toni Tone and Ms. Keys.  Although the song is short in length, you can feel Alicia's passion as she sings the vocals.   &quot;Wake Up&quot; has Alicia talking about the trials and tribulations of a relationship and how things that were happening before aren't happening now.   So if they don't get things together, it will definitely be too late to maintain the relationship.  &quot;When You Really Love Someone&quot; reminds me of &quot;A Woman's Worth&quot; as Alicia reminds us what happens when you really love someone just as she did when she explained to us what a woman was worth.   &quot;Slow Down&quot; is a nice midtempo jam that is worth checking out as well.  There is no fast forward material on this CD at all.<br />The only disappointment that I have with &quot;The Diary Of Alicia Keys&quot; is that she left off two songs that were supposed to be on this CD.  One song was a track with G Unit's Lloyd Banks and the other is a banger with Nas and Rakim entitled &quot;The Streets Of New York&quot;.   The song samples Nas' &quot;NY State Of Mind&quot; and has nice verses from both rappers on the track.  I guess Ms. Keys thought &quot;Karma&quot; was enough of a hip hop representation for this CD.   Overall, if you enjoyed &quot;Songs In A Minor&quot;, you will enjoy &quot;The Diary Of Alicia Keys&quot;.   In my opinion, there aren't any &quot;Troubles&quot;, &quot;Butterflyz&quot;, or &quot;Goodbye&quot; worthy tracks on &quot;The Diary Of Alicia Keys&quot; but I am thoroughly satisfied with the upgrade in production and the writing skills of Ms. Keys.<br />James' Top 5<br />1) Karma<BR>2) If I Ain't Got You<BR>3) Diary<BR>4) You Don't Know My Name<BR>5) Wake Up

B0000E1WKE|2.0|I'm been a long time fan of Whitney and it is sad that this current album wasn't well conceptualized and delivered. This album was produced with little or no thought in the selection of tracks and interpreting the song. Whitney sings like she is rushing to get done with her performance. If you have her first few albums, you can clearly see the talent that could have made any horrible song come to life. But this time around, Whitney tries and fails to deliver. Her rendition seems rushed, deep, hoarsy (and sometimes even raspy) vocals make us wonder why she chose to not to invest on her gifts but squander all her god given talent on drugs and be with a wife beater. Almost like she is headed to a path of personal destruction. Her deteriorating vocals truly mirrors her self destruction, judged from her erratic tv appearences. I am extremely dissapointed with this latest release of hers. What has become of Whitney?
B000067J1H|5.0|Fight Club is elegant and brutal, sophisticated and terrifying. It makes you squirm and ask for more... You will watch it twice.  Fight Club asks the life questions that every consumer in the USA should be asking of themselves. It grabs our values by the throat and demands that they answer for themselves.  Beautifully photographed, the movie is dark and disturbing in hopes that you will not lose the point.  It admonishes but never preaches. It challenges without giving the answers. Fight club is about soap, and one man's search for meaning. It's about loyalty, leadership, and the mentality of the pack.  It may stretch your sensibilities, but it will definitely make you think.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah seems timeless. Her voice is magical. This is another great album. She has never let me down and I always come back for more. A true artist with her songwriting and instrumental talents. I don't know about you, but think she is awesome. I definitely recommend this cd, especially to Sarah fans.
B00005JLEU|4.0|It is my assumption that this movie has sold so much because so many people have seen Princess Mononoke on video and expected alot.<br />The movie is alright by my standards, but is more of a kid film. The animation is better than Princess Mononoke, but I think it falls short in terms of action.<br />You can read the plot synopsis anywhere. A girl gets trapped in a magical land after moving and such. For those of you who haven't seen it... Don't expect an action movie like Princess Mononoke. This movie barely has any action(mabye a dragon scene for 2 seconds), and it is more of a kid film. Still, if you don't particularly care about action and just want to watch something, have fun.

B00008DDXC|1.0|The movie starts you out with an older Harry Potter. It's obvious that he is going through puberty because his voice is squeakin' and it makes him sound goofy at times. They are all going through puberty. Anyways, I think the film really falls short in terms of enjoyment.<br />The new people offer no excitement. Sure, mabye that teacher guy was okay... Draco's father is incredibly boring and isn't really mysterious at all. He can't really act at all. From what it looks like, they hired him because he is somewhat resembalant of Draco but he isn't convincing enough to be enjoyable.<br />The movie has it's action, but the first half is boring. The first 20 minutes of the movie have some nice special effects but overall they set the tone for a boring and prolonged movie.<br />To wrap it up though, in the end... a movie will get a lot of praise if it is a popular book adaptation. Pass this one up. Sorry to those who are die-hard fans. I do not think this movie was very entertaining though.
B0000C6JUK|5.0|Definately worth buying this edition of the CD, I bought the original edition of Sleeping With Ghosts and was unsure whether or not to buy it again just for the bonus CD, scared I'd regret it, but when I did buy it that certainly wasnt the case. There are 10 bonus tracks so even if you already have the original edition it's worth buying it as it's like a whole new album, and every single song is brilliant! Especially Big Mouth Strikes again, Placebo's version is better than the original! This bonus Cd is a valuable addition to any Placebo fan's CD collection, it's not just a collection of songs unworth of the album, because believe me, many of the songs on the bonus CD are better than those on the actual album...
B00008J4P5|1.0|Bad drumming, below average guitar playing and mediocre amateurish songwriting has somehow taken the music world temporarily by storm. It must be the clothes becaues it certainly isn't the singing. A decade from now folks will look back and ask what were you people thinking? Didn't you have any musical taste?<BR>Oh well the dumbing down of America continues...
0385504209|5.0|I have to admit it took me a little while to get into it but on a flight to Las Vegas I took this book with me and I don't think I picked my head up the entire time.  The ending is so full of twists and turns I kept thinking there had to be more.  I can't wait to read Angels and Demons by Brown.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is one of the most relaxing CD's I have come across in a long time. When I was in labor, I listened to her cd the entire time and felt so at peace. I bought several copies and have given them as gifts. Great Choice.   BCJ
0156027321|5.0|One of the most original novels to date.  Must read!!
0792844890|3.0|This movie was very funny i have to admit, but i think the acting was about as bad as the lunch lady's gooolash crap. The story-line was ok, not too bad, but they could have done a better job. The graphics/visuals were sooo fake, for example, at the end where the alien-type thing comes out of the guys stomach was about as fake as those &quot;Hulk Hands&quot;. The only thing that was good about this movie was the mocking of star-wars and all of the funny jokes. But they could have done a way better job on the acting, and of course the visuals/graphics, but it was made in the 80's, so it's understandable.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Why do these people who call them &quot;fans&quot; keep comparing britney and christina? Although she does not have a strong voice she's one hell of an entertainer. Madonna and Michael Jackson will definitely not go down in history as best vocalists but they will definitely be remembered as the world's best entertainers! And Britney is on her way there as long as &quot;her hips are moving at a rapid pace.&quot; Isn't it ironic that these &quot;fans&quot; that are giving her negative reviews are also giving us alternative artists to listen. Please get in the zone or stay out and shut up. Your choice.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of being a Wallflower is by far the best book I have ever read. Everything about the book kept me hooked. The way Stephen Chbosky writes kept me there the wording is beautiful... i fell in love with charlie. I saw myself in each character in this book. I absolutely love it.
B00008S2VG|3.0|I really enjoy this CD, and though others claim it to be redundant and derivative, I (luckily in this case) don't have enough experience with Madonna's recent output to see it as such. It may not be as good as Ray of Light, but it's far from being a poor album.<br />I guess some may see the album as trite and far too self-reflective (it's a bit too Freudian in spots), but I for one find it to still be appealing and engaging to enter the mind (or minds) of one of our culture's most controversial and popular artists. Again, it may sound a bit too much like the diary of an angst-filled High Schooler at times, but we've all got a bit of what Madonna speaks of here in us. When she's not dabbing at psychological blueprints she seems to talk about, you know, love and stuff, and, hey, whatever -- many of the lyrics are cliche, but some are genuinely passionate and moving (Nothing Fails, my favorite song on the album).<br />Yes, the beats and guitar work seem oft uninspired and a little lazier than they probably should, but they're still entertaining more often than not, and catchy at the most fundamental level. Speaking of catchy -- Die Another Day -- WOW. I've read some harsh, harsh reviews of this single, but I don't understand it for the life of me; what a great song! Those strings kill me.<br />Overall, I don't think this album will be marked as a classic by Madonna, because it isn't anything truly special lyrically or musically, but at the same time it's an interesting enough work -- both lyrically and musically -- to warrant at least a few listens.<br />Oh yeah, and she states she isn't a Christian or a Jew, but there's all that hooplah around her and that mystical Jewish-faith (the Kaballah?)...
0385504209|5.0|This books is a real page turner.  Perhaps a little too intense in some parts, but it will keep you on the edge of your seat.  This book is unlike any other.  You will learn a lot while you are being entertained!<br />I also recommend Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices.  (See my Amazon review of book.)
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|Yeah, mixed reviews on this one abound, and I'm not going to side with either... I'll just say I enjoy it.<br />I'll be blunt: the first six songs are really catchy, the following six less so, but still hummable and fun. The music, well, it does seem rather lazy, and I think it could be fine-tuned a bit, but again, some of the hooks are amazingly catchy (tracks 1, 2, and 3) and I have an extremely hard time getting them out of my freaking head. Once they've stuck they don't wanna get out of there. <br />There isn't that much more to be said. I will say of all the bands I hear on the radio today (which, admittedly, isn't a whole lot), The Strokes stand out as one of the better ones... If nothing else, they've got an energy to their music that escapes most other bands, instead opting for, well, crap.<br />I only heard &quot;Is This It&quot; a few times and quite honestly I prefer &quot;Room on Fire&quot;. I may not be eagerly anticipating The Strokes' next album, but I'll certainly listen with open ears when it arrives.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|How any so-called &quot;Beatles&quot; fan can be annoyed at this remix is beyond comprehension. This cd sounds incredible. And now you have 2 different versions of this album. I always thought the more the Beatles release the better! The seperation of the instruments is fantastic. There is no tape hiss. Many different things on each track jump out at you through out. I just wish they editted on the great ending to &quot;Get Back&quot; from the single version. There are 2 unreleased versions of Beatles songs on this cd. &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; is live from the rooftop concert in 1969. &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; is an alternate take. Who ever said there is no sonic revelation in listening to this cd needs to get the wax cleaned out of their ears. &quot;Let It Be&quot; has never sounded so good. The dynamics are incredible. There are some very different remixes. &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is a very acoustic mix. &quot;I Me Mine&quot; has been stripped of it's overproduced sound. But, they did mimic that great edit Spector did on this George song that adds another minute to its length. The bonus disk is interesting, but annoying. There are bits of songs and dialogue on it. Who wants to hears 15 seconds from a song? Put the entire song on. Although there is a cool version of &quot;Maggie Mae/Fancy Me Chances&quot; on disk 2. There will always be nincompoops who complain about remixing, Paul, respect or whatever about each new Beatles release. Enjoy it and be thankful that they still release stuff we haven't heard yet.
B000002U9L|4.0|That's probably the main reason this soundtrack/score appeals to me so much, but another reason would probably be it's a genuinely enticing musical experience.<br />Of course, there's Davie Bowie's songs, and Trevor Jones' score. First off -- Jones is a great, underrated film composer with some magnificent pieces under his belt. His scores are always appropriate and (unlike a lot of composers today) most often subtle and non-intrusive. That said, Labyrinth is certainly not his pinnacle achievement, and it seems to transport us back to the whacky, beginning-of-a-synthisized-era 80's than the far-away, extravagant universe of Labyrinth. To his credit, the theme for Sarah (&quot;Sarah&quot;), the main character, is beautiful and enchanting, likewise the &quot;Hallucination&quot; piece is rather hypnotic with it's synthetic strings, sleazy saxaphones and whiny electric guitar rifs, but overall the score isn't the standout here.<br />So, yeah, this CD is, in short, Bowie's. It's an awesome combination of rock-rolling, playful songs that are brilliantly orchestrated/produced and wholly fitting for the whacky, imaginative nature of the film. On the other hand, some of the songs (like those in other unexpected films -- Willy Wonka, off the top of my head), on closer examination, have some rather eerie, psychadelic lyrics that are quite frankly pretty surreal. Strange stuff.<br />But the songs, man are they indispensable. &quot;As the World Falls Down&quot; is haunting and unforgettable -- a love song for the ages. &quot;Dance Magic Dance&quot; was stuck in my head as a little kid and still has yet to get out -- I have every note and lyric memorized. &quot;Within You&quot; is, like the Jones' piece I mentioned above, absolutely hypnotic and other-wordly. &quot;Chilly Down&quot; and &quot;Underworld&quot; (both renditions) follow in &quot;Dance Magic Dance&quot;'s footsteps as irresistibly catchy and fun numbers (I can't decide if I prefer the orchestral version of Underworldor the more spirited, pop version concluding the album). In short, every song on here is great.<br />Watch the film, as it's quite a treat for the imagination, and chances are you'll get the CD shortly after.
B0000C1733|4.0|The chili peppers are an unreal band whove produced alot of quality music.  Thats why its tough to pick songs to put on their greatest hits.  Some great songs that were left out are &quot;one Big Mob&quot; , &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; , &quot;Stone Cold Bush&quot; , and get rid of some of their more modern stuff.  A few songs from claifornication or by the way are alright but if you are a true chili peppers fan then you gotta go back to when they were raw.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|when i first heard the strokes i thought what everyone else did. finally, a good rock band. sure we all have our favorites, but lets be honest. when the strokes came out there was really no big bands that were really good. i bought is this it and fell in love with them and the songs. ive been a fan ever since.<br />however, they havent really progressed. i got room on fire and at first didnt like it. i found the lyrics to be confusing and every song sounded almost the same. when i gave it another chance i realized, although the sound is very similar to the first album, its a good sound. and what do lyrics really mean anyway? the way i think of it is, if it sounds good, then who cares? one thing i dont get though is their ticket prices. what, all of a sudden they are the freaking rolling stones? i payed 50 bucks for their new years tickets in vegas. this better be a good show. or else i will change this review and make it sound horrible so no one buys the album. i am serious.
0749748508|5.0|Wow!  What a thrill to find this book still available after over 40 years!  I read it repeatedly when I was in about 4th grade.  It says a lot about the quality of the story that it has stuck with me all these years.  It really showed me at a young age the suffering that some animals must endure, and the quiet patience and courage with which they endure it.  I can still picture Joey struggling in thick mud to pull his load.  And even as young as I was, it made me understand more what my older uncles had experienced in WW1.  I am definitely getting this for the kiddies, but before I give it to them, I am going to read it again myself!
B00005JMTN|4.0|I saw Big Fish while in limited release in New York City. What a sweet little picture. Too nice infact, it'll be sure to be ignored. You will either love it or hate it because it's just plain sincere and straight forward. I found albert finney to be as charismatic as ever. Ewan McGregor, was a bit type cast, but he's good at playing the perfect guy. It's the most un-tim burton, tim burton has ever been. Which adds to the movies unique look and feel. He allows his imagination to grace the screen but unlike things like Kill Bill it never distracts from the over all experience. Tim Burton said he made this movie as therapy for losing his parents recently. And that what this movie feels like, good medicine. I recently had a scare with my mom going to the hospital, and this movie really made me feel better.<br />The stories, this is the meat of the movie. They are fantastic. They are funny. I believe they really happened. They are hauntingly surreal and are as intriguing to watch as they must have been to hear. This is where the movie takes off and sweeps you off your feet. I won't ruin  stories themselves but they were a complete delight to behold. So much so, that the scenes in between them tend to drag on until the next tall tale comes along.<br />My criticism are few but if I had to nit pick I would say that the cynical son is almost TOO cynical, and it's really stupid as to WHY he doesn't talk to his father anymore. But when he starts to soften up, that falls to the way side. The movie starts off a little strange, the editing could have been tighter and basically when we dont see albert finney or his younger self things definetly slow down on screen. It has its flaws.<br />And last but not least, the Pearl Jam song in the credits...PERFECT. I smell a best song oscar for Eddie Vedder and crew.<br />Good Job Tim. Sweet movie. Don't get so hyped about it folks. It's not Ed Wood and it's not anything else. It's a bit over sweet, so it depends on what kind of mood your in. I for one got hooked and reeled in by the very big heart of this very big fish.

B000067CPX|4.0|This is a great album, but I must warn all of the Chili Peppers fans out there who have yet to pick up this album.  It is much more refined, and not as hard and wayward as some of their other music.  And, (Horrors) they have horns on many songs.  Think Rush, and add a bit of Chicago.  What you have is By the Way.  This is a very good album, but it is different to say the least.  Borrow before you buy.  I know many people who love this album more than any other Chili Peppers album, but I do know those who think that the 16 bucks would be better spent on beer.
0971830509|5.0|many fans of the work of robert w. chambers insist that &quot;the king in yellow&quot; is an actual book, the existence of which can only be taken on faith.  while i am naturally skeptical about this, as i am about the &quot;necronomicon&quot;, i find the soul crushing ambiance of cosmic doom and impending insanity far superior to many of the famed tales of lovecraft. &quot;the repairer of reputations&quot; is to my mind ranked with m.r. james &quot;casting of the runes&quot; and &quot;the shadow over innsmouth&quot;. whether he was writing about a real book or not, chambers obviously had something weighing on his mind.  creepy as hell.
B000002UDD|4.0|Being a huge Megadeth fan, I love Peace Sells, and Rust In Peace. They are amazing albums. However, So far , So good , So What! is a great album. It lacks stuff that RIP and PS...BWB had, but it is still a good thrash album.The opening songs Into the Lungs of Hell, and Set The World Afire are great thrash tunes. Hook In mouth, Liar,and Mary Jane also are good ones. I think 502 is the weak point, and was obviously made during Dave's addictions.In My darkest Hour is the best on here, and a classic.Anarchy In The UK is a cool track, but im not a fan of covers. overall, this cd is one of those cds where you either like to death, or hate it.
B00008DDSC|4.0|This is a perfect example of a fantastic film ruined by an unrealistic ending. Throwing tomatoes at the tied up guy--REALLY!! The spanking scene is probably the most sexy you will ever see, and the acting is OUTSTANDING!! Yes, you can't spank yourself, as she tried; not enough arm action. I know--I TRIED IT!!
B000002J1O|3.0|Although this album contains some of Genesis' best songs ever, I must dissent from the consensus view that it's their best - especially when compared with its immediate neighbors in their discography: \\"Foxtrot\\" (which I consider their best Gabriel-era album) and \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" (a masterpiece until it runs out of gas halfway through the second disc).  There's just way too much filler and bluff after you get past the three best songs.    But those three songs!  \\"Dancing With the Moonlight Night\\" begins the record in dramatic and majestic fashion; its lyrics lament the disappearance of Merrie Olde England with an aching nostalgia (\\"Can you tell me where my country lies...Paperlate, cried a voice in the crowd...The note he left was signed `Old Providence' - it seems he's drowned\\").  The keyboard solo at the end of the song sets the tone for the rest of the album: this is Tony Banks' coming out party.  Even better is \\"Firth of Fifth,\\" with its gorgeous piano intro and outro, and Banks' ingenious use of theme and variation (for an excellent analysis of this song, check out Edward Macan's fine analysis of progressive rock, \\"Rocking the Classics.\\")  Finally, there's \\"Cinema Show/Aisle of Plenty,\\" which begins as a ballad about a lower-class Romeo and Juliet, spins into a euphoric extended instrumental section, and concludes with a restatement of the \\"Moonlight Night\\" theme.  \\"Cinema Show\\" ranks with \\"The Musical Box\\" and \\"Supper's Ready\\" as one of the very best Genesis songs ever.    These three tracks make up about half the album's running time, and qualify the record as essential Genesis.  But the rest of the songs constitute a serious drop in quality.  \\"I Know What I Like\\" is a shoddy (and annoying) early attempt at a Genesis pop song; the flaccid \\"More Fool Me\\" features a tentative Phil Collins attempting lead vocals for the first time, with mixed results; \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" is a poor man's \\"Supper's Ready,\\" without the spark of genius thatmade the earlier song work so brilliantly; and \\"After the Ordeal\\" is a nice instrumental that fades from memory as soon as it ends.    If you're into early Genesis, \\"Selling England By The Pound\\" is a must based on its glorious peaks.  But its valleys disqualify it from masterpiece status.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This CD surprised me a bit- by not being so repetitive in it's previous themes as the Two Towers cd was. the Return of the King CD features beautiful music and truly wonderful vocals. The songs encompass all that the 'Rings' stand for- hardships, pain, friendship, love, and victory. Highlights include the songs featuring Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen, &quot;Twilight and Shadow&quot;, and the very last song, by Lennox. This is a must for all 'Rings' fans, and for those who simply like great quality music.
B000083C49|5.0|Over 17 years after its initial release, The Voyage Home remains the most popular of the Star Trek films, in terms of box office receipts, and a general audience favorite.<br />This film is lighter than most cinematic Treks. The &quot;fish out of water&quot; story capitalizes on both the writers' and actors' strengths, and the humor springs organically from the material, rather than seeming forced.  Some of the sequels have attempted to integrate humor into their stories, but with less success. All of the actors are at their best here, particularly William Shatner, who has a deft comic touch. (The look on Kirk's face when he sees Spock swimming in the whale tank is worth the price of DVD.) The only complaint I have about this film is the score. Leonard Rosenmann's retread of Lord of the Rings grows more irritating with each viewing.<br />Paramount's new transfer is a considerable improvement over the first DVD issue, and light years ahead of earlier versions. The picture quality on my laserdisc was very poor, with a grainy unfocused quality that made it appear that the print had been dragged across the floor. The VHS quality was even worse. On DVD the image is considerably sharper, colors are more vibrant without bleeding. The sound quality is also improved, and there is a track in French. (&quot;Monsieur Spock?&quot; &quot;Oui, Capitan Kirk?&quot;)  The commentary track featuring Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner doesn't shed much light on the film, but remains entertaining, as is Michael Okuda's text commentary.  The bonus disc features a light but informative treatise on time travel, a moving tribute to actor Mark &quot;Sarek&quot; Lenard, and the usual making of featurettes.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|It's simply &quot;Wonderful,&quot; to steal an adjective from Joel Grey's second act number.<br />I saw this show on November 8th, and it was probably one of the best shows I've ever seen, maybe tying with RENT, which I have had loyalties to for a much longer time. I've been tracking the development and tryout of this show since June of this year and before, and run the 2nd Unofficial Wicked Fansite.<br />The show doesn't come off quite as well on CD as on stage, and a bootleg I've burned of the San Francisco tryout of Wicked better captures the raw emotion of the performances and more of the spoken lines. However, someone who isn't biased toward a previous recording will love this CD. I love the music, and I have since I took a first listen in around September/October. The music sticks in your head forever.<br />I have to say the performers are some of the best in show business, but, unlike most, I think the show is still Idina's and that all the attempts to allow Kristin to take control of the show are wrong, especially considering Idina is the title character and should be the emotional core.<br />Favorite songs include &quot;Defying Gravity,&quot; &quot;Dancing Through Life,&quot; &quot;What Is This Feeling?&quot; and &quot;For Good.&quot; All of them are good though. This show has a great breadth of musical styles, from power ballads, to traditional-sounding show songs, to soft-shoe, pop, and rock.<br />Go out and buy this, and, if you can, fly out and see the show.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|For the vampire lovers of the world.  This movie has awesome ambience and action.  Well acted and scripted.  If you're looking for a movie that will make you think, this isn't for you.  It's a great sit-down-and-have-great-time movie that you'll want to watch over and over!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|A brilliant combination of classic Beatles/Beach Boys (Pet Sounds, mostly)/Elton John sounds blends with a Jeff Buckley-esque/Thom Yorke-like voice in a joyful way in Rufus Wainwright's latest production, one where his lyrical genius was combined with Marius deVries's talents producing (having previously worked with the likes of Bj&ouml;rk, Massive Attack, Madonna and David Bowie), yielding an instant classic.<br />From the instant the opening &quot;Oh, What A World&quot; kicks in you know you're in front of a work of art, one that elevates you and tickles your very soul with its beauty! And the album goes on with one brilliant and beautiful track after another. My favorites (tough call, I have to say), beside the opener, were &quot;Go Or Go Ahead&quot; and of the deepest songs in the album, &quot;Dinner At Eight&quot;.<br />You see... my first experience with Rufus' music was not the best one. After his self-titled debut album, he was on tour and he opened for Tori Amos at a concert I attended in 2000. What it was? I don't know, but I just hated every minute of his show: didn't like it a bit, so this album was more than a pleasant surprise! Like a pie in the face, and a very delicious one, it was...<br />The fact that Wainwright mentions on his web site that the follow-up to this project, &quot;Want Two will have some of the more daunting tracks, the operatic, weird stuff, some heavy numbers that relate to [his] classical sensibilities...&quot; makes me just fantasize about it, considering 'Want One' is in itself alread a very daunting project! We can only sit back and delight ourselves with '... One' in the meantime.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a short lived science fiction series terribly abused by Fox.  This is your chance to view it in the order intended by Joss Whedon.  The acting was outstanding with every character contributing to the overall story.  This is ensemble acting at its best.  Simply put, this is some of the best work done by Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy and Angel.  Highly recommend.
B000003Z4C|5.0|Oh, Nick, I thank thee for what you recorded! I'd kill for 'Loverman', 'Red right hand (this memorable bass guitar line)', 'I let love in' and 'Lay me low'. These songs are nothing very innovative but anyway precious gems not only for Cave's fans. If you didn't like 'The first born is dead' etc. you may give Nick a second chance - he's more 'edible' now, but nevertheless fantastic, and singing unforgettable things, with his dark humour, and well-known deviations.  As for music, it's almost an album to be played on the radio, as for lyrics, I'd never let my little child listen to the radio if I knew Nick was there. No drawbacks, as for this album, a complete masterpiece
B000002UJQ|3.0|I don't get today's youth.One look at some of these gushy  responds   makes me relize every generation needs a GOD BAND.Tomorrow Radiohead will be on the trashheap of rock history discarded  for the new hot flavor for alienated youth.I'm a old fart of 41 but I was a teenbopper when punk and alt rock happened.I remember playing 'LONDON CALLING' by THE CLASH on vinyl records on a turntable the day it came out! Remember kiddies rock n roll is almost 50 years old what might sound quaint and  old to you  was cutting edge at the time.There was a time when young people use to listen to Eddie FISHER and PAT BOONE. Before ELVIS white people by and large listened to setimental pop tunes.What I'M getting  at is listen to a lot of different rock music.Saying O.K COMPUTER is the best cd of all-time shows how simple minded and narrow-minded some young people are.Hell,as you get older your tastes in music will change.The best rock is simple with hooks and a good beat.I don't wanna say RADIOHEAD is pretendious but they remind me of U2.The Clash were 'THE ONLY BAND THAT MATTERS'and they fell off their high horse.Some of the most influential bands<BR>in rock history like THE VELVET UNDERGROUND and BIG STAR didn't sell diddley squat.A lot of today's artists worshipped these groups.BO DIDDLEY is 75 BUT REMEMBER BO DIDDLEY IS A GUNSLINGER!
B00009KMCB|5.0|The CD was perfect with just those 11 songs, but now they added one more song and made a better version of My Immortal! So now it's EXTRA perfect! I love Evanescence.. and they'll probably be my favorite band for a while. You probably won't be able to get this CD unless you order it online, so if you don't do that, just order the regular copy - it's great as it is.
B0000028RR|5.0|O.K. A rap rock rock band from l.a nowt new there, wrong rage against the machine are the most powerful and political band for a long long time. This album, arguably their best studio album, is a true mix of full on hardcore drumming from Brad Wilk who is scarily fast and hard at times, the best drummer around at the moment. You also get the pleasure of Mr. Zack De La Rocha a musical genius his voice and Tom Morello's guitar are the higlights of this album, they really just provide fsuch an awe inspiring performance.<br />I recommend 3 tracks, killing in the name of 10/10  the best song on thew album,, wake up 9.9999999/10 brilliant but not quite there, bombtrack amazing intro really shows tom morrello's skills at their best
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is actually my second review of Firefly, the first one I wrote before receiving my pre-ordered set.  I want to mention here that this set has some highly unusual, but nice packaging.  Instead of the usual series fanfold, or the full sized box set, they do a boxed set with four, half-size, DVD cases in an  enclosing art box.  The DVDs themselves are fairly well designed, with a main menu, and sub-menus for each episode.  My lone problem with the set is the volume, which may be something unavoidable with the series sound track.  I had to turn my TV up fairly high to get ample sound, and it distorts a little at that volume.<br />What I just mentioned would not have inspired me to write a second review.  It was in watching the pilot episode again that I have to again point out how good this series was.  I really think that Joss Whedon, the creator of Firefly, is maybe too laid-back to have gone to bat when he was needed. Where's Robert Conrad, (He battled another network, tooth and nail over his series, Black Sheep) when you need him!  Joss should have insisted that Fox show the Pilot as the first episode, like it was designed!<br />Caution, potential spoilers ahead!  This won't reveal a lot, but I wanted to point out how wrong Fox was in playing the pilot last instead of first. Fox reasoning was that we couldn't comprehend a complex plot, and group of characters.  The pilot starts with a few minutes of flashback that sees, Mal (the captain) and Zoë (his first mate and friend) on the wrong side of a losing battle between rebels and an oppressive type of  federation.  A civil war of sorts, where they were on the gray side.  This did a decent job of character establishment I thought.<br />Cut to the future, and we find them cutting into a salvaged ship for some goods left behind.  We are introduced to Wash, the obvious ships pilot, and it's immediately apparent he's husband now to Zoë. Then we find the ships techie, is a young girl named Kaylee. As they cleverly avoid getting caught by a military ship, we are introduced to Jayne, (a male) a tough mercenary who's hired on to make a few bucks.  Five of the nine final cast members are introduced in the first ten minutes. The well written story has seen to it, that we have some degree of background on each of them. No confusion here yet Fox. The first plot, of the extraordinary triple-plotted pilot, begins when they must drop off the goods, and get paid.<br />Landing on a city of sorts, another character is introduced by calling her (Inara) to meet them. She's an Ambassador of sorts, a highly reputed &quot;companion&quot; (prostitute) by trade.  Her introduction is equally easy to understand.  After landing, Mal, (the captain) instructs the crew to take on passengers while they go sell the goods.  They take on three, (plus a stasis chamber) one, a preacher appropriately named Book, another, a doctor, named Simon, and the third, an undercover federal agent, tailing the doctor.  Again because of the way they are introduced, there's no confusion with who they are. The types of  characters are distinct, maybe not for Fox suits, but certainly for Sci-Fi fans!<br />After getting shafted on the payment agreement, they must now take the goods elsewhere.  The captain shows his restraint here, and some good sense, in knowing when not to go for broke. He makes the best decision he can, and gets underway.  Two kick off the second plot of three, enter the federal agent, who in trying to capture the doctor, shoots Kaylee in panic!  The doctor leverages his services to make them run from the federal forces. After finding out what's in the doctors stasis pod, (River, his mentally screwed up sister) we have the final crew regular.<br />The captain makes a deal with an old business acquaintance of his to sell the goods, and along the way, they pass a large ship piloted by Reavers!  Reavers are apparently, a futuristic equivalent of Commancheros, only much worse.  This is the thread of the third plot.  Fortunately, the Reaver ship passes them by for the moment.<br />Landing on a desert moon, some clever figuring by the captain puts them in a position to survive an impending gun battle.  An amazing bit of writing by Joss Whedon has all three independent plot threads collide, and conclude in the space of five minutes.  An amazing feat for a TV series, one that's rarely been equaled, even in big budget films. Despite the interweaving of three distinct plots, this was so well done that most viewers could easily understand.<br />I've heard this series, and its cancellation described as a cautionary tale of making a complex, intelligent story, for a medium, (television) meant for those with short attention spans! I take exception to that as an enlightened viewer.  I believe, had this pilot been shown first, instead of last. Had it been given the proper promotion, (instead of none) that any normal, two-hour pilot would get?  The series would have been a moderate hit, and may even, have prevented the cancellation of John Doe, a decent series that followed it.  My question to the Fox brass is that, if they indeed thought we couldn't handle that many character, (nine) in one, two-hour pilot. How were we supposed to figure out who they all were, when not introduced, in a later episode?  Did they (the suits) mean to tank this show on purpose?  You be the judge!
B0000CDLA7|4.0|How can anyone say that this album sounds like Godsmack or Tool(who, incidentally, are not Nu-Metal --&gt; that would be Korn or Limp Bizkit, and yes there is a difference)? <br />I have to wonder at the people that give this album 1 star.  Do they even like DT or are just faking so they can seem intellectual to their friends?  Clearly, this album is far and away better than anything else out there right now and probably will be as long as Blink 182 and all the wannabe punk bands are on EmptyV. That is justice enough for at least 3 stars.<BR>To call this Nu-Metal is blasphemous.
B000099T2L|1.0|I bought this CD because I really liked ''Crazy In Love''...God what a mistake !!! There's only like 3 good tracks on this CD : ''Crazy In Love'' ''Bonnie And Clyde'' ''Work It''...the rest is pathetic ! And the hidden track ''Daddy'' oh my God this is so Nasty ! What was she thinking ??? Anyway, I'm really not happy with my purchase, I want my $$$ back ! There's another album comming in 2004...believe me I won't fall in the trap this time, I've learned my lesson...Buy Nelly Furtado or Sarah McLachlan's new CDs...now that's what I call MUSIC !
B0000CAXIC|5.0|The Color and the Shape is a wonderful album filled with catchy guitar harmonies, great rhythms, and melodic lyrics.  It shows Dave Grohl is a versatile songwriter and guitarist as well as a drummer.
0345350499|5.0|Let me just start out by saying that this is an AMAZING book.  I laughed, I cried, I read it again!  This book was hard to put down.  The story puts Morgaine le Faye as the heroine of the book and gives a refreshing look at the beliefs of the Druids.  I wouldn't recommend it for devout Christians...but anyone that loves a great story and has great imagination will love the book!  Dont rent the movie, buy the book!
6302891272|5.0|I am junior at Nagoya International School and have just finished studying Shakespeare$B!G(Bs Macbeth. In addition to reading it, we were fortunate to see 4 film versions of it. Of all the films, Kurosawa$B!G(Bs $B!H(BThrone of Blood$B!I(B appealed to me the most because of its uniqueness. Although the film was in black and white, it created an eerie atmosphere and a vivid picture of the mood, the character and their actions. Like Shakespeare, Kurosawa uses old Japanese language, and even for us native Japanese speakers much of it was incomprehensible, especially the chant at the beginning and the end. However, the language suited the traditional feudal Japanese setting of the samurai and helped create the mood. Lady Macbeth (Asaji), her face a stark white, in $B!H(BThrone of Blood$B!I(B was very emotionless and she rarely talked; and when she did, it was slow and unclear. She was a mysterious character who said strange things which also contributed to the mood. The violence was very graphic and even though film was monochromatic, the blood stood out very clearly. The violent scenes were very realistic especially at the end when Washizu (Macbeth) is running around trying to avoid getting shot by what seems to be a million arrows. I recommend this film to any student studying Macbeth as it provides a very relevant yet unique comparison to the other versions.
6304806442|1.0|I just couldn't believe the hype this movie got when it came out.  I had trouble trying to follow the conversations (they were spoken in a very thick Sort of Scotch accent).  The people were sooooooo ugly.  What happened to all the beautiful movie stars?????????????  The men were ugly and the women were even uglier if that's possible.  These people where obviously extreme low end people.  Unless you like junkies, baby death and ugly people pooping in their beds don't bother with this.  Rent &quot;The Full Monty&quot; instead!  It was a much better movie.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I was a Britney Hater til November 18 2003...Every single track is GOOD ! She did a great job with this CD, there's only 1 POP song wich is ''Brave New Girl''. Don't listen to people who gave this CD 1 Star, because they obviously didn't even listen to it ! Buy It ! Worth the $$$, I hate ''Baby One...'' ''Oops I Did...'' and ''Britney'', but this one kicks a$$...
B000002UAF|5.0|Seven great performances from John Lennon:<br />A Hard Day's Night<br />I Should Have Known Better<br />If I Fell<br />Tell Me Why<br />Any Time At All<br />You Can't do That<br />I'll Be Back<br />McCartney also has 3 terrific solos:<br />And I Love Her<br />Can't Buy Me Love<br />Things We Said Today<br />There is. of course, some great vocal harmony supporting these songs.<br />In this album, both Lennon and McCartney have given us some interesting songs which waver between minor and major tonalities:<br />And I Love Her and If I Fell begin minor, but end up major. However the McCartney song Things We Said Today and the Lennon song I'll Be Back hover intriguingly between minor and major keys throughout.<br />Tell Me Why may be one of the most jazz-influenced Beatles song: the chords and melody owe quite a bit to that genre. Can't Buy Me Love also has a jazzy tinge.<br />Acoustic guitars [including the 12 stringed variety] are prominent and sound terrific.<br />Highly recommended
B0000DD7NL|4.0|I really didn't feel Alicia Key's first Album except for the few songs they played constantly on the radio. However, this one is very mature!  A nice mellow CD that will be played over and over and over.  &quot;You don't know my name&quot;, &quot;Harlem's Nocturne&quot; and &quot;Nobody Not really&quot; are just a few favorites!  Awesome beats and mixes. Very nicely done. Maybe not a mainstream CD but definately Heavy and note worthy.
B00005JMFI|5.0|This movie made me laugh hysterically in the movie theater, but the people around me didn't seem to mind because they were laughing just as hard. If you want to see a good, clean holiday film that will make your sides burst from laugter, then i recommend you see Elf. I cannot wait till it comes out on DVD!!! When i first went to see it in theaters, i was expecting a little more adult humor... however i was not dissappointed by the film in the least.
6302891272|5.0|I'm a student from Nagoya International School and have just seen the movie &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; in our unit in Shakespeare's Macbeth. By watching the movie, I saw how Kurosawa has adapted Shakespeare's Macbeth to a setting in the Japanese feudal time period. As a person who reads and speaks Japanese, I felt the Japanese title &quot;Kumonosu jou&quot;, meaning Spider-web castle had a strong impact on the film. One of the most interesting characters in both Throne of Blood and Macbeth was the witch. The witch took a big part in the story where he/she tells Macbeth his destiny. This drives Macbeth to his tragic end. In the original version of Macbeth, there were 3 witches telling Macbeth his future which motivated Macbeth to his murders. But in Kurosawa$B!G(Bs Throne of Blood, when Washizu was lost in the woods, he meets an old man spinning a wheel and making thread. By seeing that, I thought Kurosawa recognized that the witches controlled the story in the original version of Macbeth. So the old man spinning symbolized that the witch had everything in control. I think that is another reason that Kurosawa named his film Spider-web Castle, with the idea of spider-web suggesting the witch was in control of everything. I recommend this film to students who have read Macbeth and studied the play carefully, as they will be are able to compare this film to the original version of the play and enjoy the differences between the two.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Actually this CD is ok and not that excellent or anything. I hate hiphop and would've given this CD 0 stars but the the ballad Everytime is worth the whole CD. It's haunting and beautiful-so melodious. If someone said Britney can't sing, they haven't listened to this. Boy, she's got some talent. I love Shadow and Brave new girl a lot.<BR>I really wish the old Britney would come back. But anyway, everybody seems to like the new her. I listened to a hiphop version of Baby one more time which Britney sang and I was so sickened. Britney's obviously run out of good tunes and has switched to hip hop. Hip hop sucks. It's like a horrible mixture of pop and rap. I only like Eminem's stuff. Britney's only ok at it.<BR>Boom Boom, toxic, Showdown, Outrageous and Breathe on me were some of the other tracks that I liked. Me against music is one of the reasons why Britney didn't sell too well. It's a great figure for todays sales but she would've sold more if she had released Toxic first.<BR>I hope there are more ballads in her new album. Britney's meant for Ballads and is excellent at the piano (yes, she plays it herself) She's so talented and the Everytime makes me cry when I listen to it (And I'm supposed to be hard-hearted basically).
B0000CNY27|3.0|The transfer is actually pretty good. The movie itself is quite dated but entertaining especially if are a comic book fan. If you loved the movie the first time by all means buy it. If you like Kurt Russell, have not seen the movie, are not really a comic book fan, and can't really imagine Kurt in a dark role, it may not be a film that trips your trigger. It really didn't work for me.
0792164903|5.0|i thought this movie would be a cheap rip off of the original like many remakes are nowdays. but wow, this movie is great! its really gothic and although its probably a horror movie, it has its bright sides as well :P johnny depp is wonderful and the entire movie is just spine tingling.
0440237688|5.0|I picked this book up to see if it would be appropriate for my precocious nine-year-old, and was blown away by Lowry's daring plot and wonderful prose. The book takes on themes that are incredibly sophisticated and examines them in ways that even a bonehead like me can wrap his mind around. Every bit as daring as 1984 and Brave New World, Lowry forces us to look very closely at what it is that makes us human, and what the costs and benefits of conformity really are. The conclusion of the book is--I hate to overuse the word, but it's the only one that fits--daring, forcing the reader to decide for him or herself just what has happened. Either way, the moment is transformative.<br /><br />Beautiful as this book is, it ISN'T appropriate for my nine-year old. Not because of the very mild and beautifully drawn budding sexuality of the protagonist, Jonas. Rather, the themes are deep and disturbing enough--and the ending open-ended enough--that I don't think a preteen would be able to take it all in. But for a teenager--or an adult--I think it is a wonderful, provocative read.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I was so blown away with this album. I went twice to see them this year and i want more!

1565847032|5.0|Coming in touch with Chomsky's ideas has had a profound affect on my life, and I'm sure, the lives of many others.   However, his books are often so dense and challenging that the prospect of picking them up can get a bit daunting.  This particular book though is a carefully edited compendium of transcripts from his public speaking engagements, and as such has a conversational tone that makes it eminently more &quot;digestible&quot; than many of his other books.  I cannot rate it highly enough!  Understanding Power is a revelation, an inspiration and, believe it or not, hard to put down.
B0000024PC|3.0|Forget about the boring Dave Grusin songs and just concentrate on the songs by Simon And Garfunkel, providers of the greatest vocal harmonies on the face of the Earth.  The most amazing thing about this album is the instrumental version of &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;, which contains the most BEAUTIFUL, HAUNTING notes that ever came from an acoustic guitar.  I don't know how Simon does it, but he manages to create an atmosphere of ineffable beauty and enchantment.  There's no vocals or bass, just an a capella acoustic guitar reading, so some would call it &quot;boring&quot;.  But those are the people who don't know the meaning of the word &quot;feeling&quot;.<br />BTW, there are two reasons why I only gave it three stars:<BR>a.) The aforementioned, boring Dave Grusin songs.<BR>b.) Most of the Simon And Garfunkel songs are either truncated or drastically altered.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I read these reviews as opinion pieces on films to get a wider perspective.  I could write the whole standard newspaper-style article but that's not really the meat of what I want to talk about, so please excuse me if I skip to the chase here.<br />This movie is about sex, but it's also about repression and shame for having deviant thoughts. These people are interesting not because of the sex (although it was lovingly, beautifully depicted in kinky glory), but because they've broken through and discovered their true selves, and put their shame aside.<br />They've made a hedonist's journey - from being small and ashamed about the body, to enjoying it fully.  I thought it was beautiful - because I think the body's needs are the expression of the true self, and we constantly put up mysterious psychological barriers against them.  <br />First off, what is shame, or modesty?  We form a mental 'box' around our sexuality - I'm not sure why. People don't go naked, even in warmer climates, I suppose because sex is not so distracting and we need a mental space in which to conduct more common social interaction - but that's not the same as shame..<br />Spader's character was obviously very ashamed of his sexual deviance.  I don't understand this - my sense is that there's only shame if the behavior is harmful to oneself or others - otherwise it's either a curiousity of a person's neurological development, and is either wonderful or a waste of time.  In any case, shame is irrelevant. <br />Even as I write this I know I couldn't live those words.  Shame, especially the sexual type, is hard-wired - just as much as the pecadillo that caused it.<br />Here we see Spader break out of his 'shame spiral'(!) and open up, beautifully - into a relationship - kinky but real - instead of his previous forays, which I gather were more of the 'kinky and weird' variety.  His character was stunted and poorly socialized, probably for all sorts of reasons.  His character was forced to change - toheal and become whole.<br />I thought it was very beautiful to see him open up and trust and allow Maggie into his life.  She forced his hand - and that's necessary - I felt it was beautiful that she cared enough to push him, hard, and take him out of his broken existence.  <br />As for Maggie, she was never really repressed or ashamed about sex - she was more of an invisible person on the periphery of others' lives.  Here we see her gain enormous power through this newfound Kink, and her love allows her to break through her follower-mentality and become a real person - with a will of her own. They open up together and become new people who can enjoy their bodies and live life to the fullest.  I thought this was a terrific movie - a rarity in that it's about sex, and is not aimed at 15-year-olds, and pulls so few punches. Usually only the French produce such films.<br />Maggie is wry and sharp, and easy on the eyes - I couldn't take mine off her - she's a star from this day forward.
B000002IWH|5.0|this sountrack is wonderful. just listening to the album takes you through the movie itself. the frist track by The Cure is great. being the first track, it really draws you in and keeps you curious about the rest of the album. overall i think its just plain great.
0688163173|5.0|A great read!<br />I truly enjoyed reading this It's a rarity these days to find an author capable of such good storytelling. The story is well written and very engaging, and despite the fact that it lost some momentum in the middle, I found myself eagerly turning pages to find out what would happen next. All in all, though this is not quite a perfect novel, it comes close.
0399103422|4.0|Mario Puzo turned the crime gene on its head by relaying the story from the prospective of the criminal instead of the crime-fighter. While he explores many themes within the novel, the one that most vividly captures the reader's imagination is his use of cultural experience to explain behavior. While Puzo was often criticized for stereotyping Italian-Americans (and to a lesser degree Irish-Americans), a proper read of the story explains that the author believed that culture designs an individual's mindset. In the case of the Godfather, the main characters have been marginalized by the larger American experience. It is not a justification of immoral behavior but an explaination as to why some individuals react in a particular fashion to a given set of circumstances. The writting is heavy - but Puzo himself said that he was more of a storyteller then a writer. Worth the price of the book and the time it takes to read.
0385504209|4.0|I think the book does a good job of gripping you early with a lot of unknown trivia about Da Vinci, Mary M, etc., but eventually runs out of steam...Left me with a sense of what was this all about
B0000524EM|5.0|my gosh! i love all of the crow movies. each carry it's own unique beauty and art.  the first crow was wonderful. brandon lee left me speechless (rest in peace brandon lee). the story line is beautifully done and the action scenes are crazy. the city of angels was beautiful as well. Mia kirshner looked amazing. although it was nothing like the first crow, the city of angels is nevertheless great. the entire movie is very gothic, and the forbidden love story is so touching. salvation is great as well because it was nothing like the previous two. instead of makeup, his face was skarred (adding a more dramatic effect to the movie as a whole). <br />its a wonderful set. i recommend everyone to go buy it. but if you more into action films then i guess this movie wouldnt appeal to you beacuse the crow has alot of art in it as well rather than just plain action.

B00007LTIC|5.0|Other people have done a fine job here explaining why this album is essential, so I won't even go there.  Atlantic released this album on CD three times and none of them even come sonically CLOSE to this version.  Even if you have multiple copies of this on CD already, this one is the goods.  Listen to the title track through headphones and you'll quickly realize that even the best Atlantic CD version of this album sounds like a cassette.  On this version, all the grunge is gone, the bottom end is much tighter, and there is actually air around the instruments now.  I don't know how Rhino does it, I'm just glad they did.  Can't wait for Drama!

B0000CEB62|5.0|First of all, this is an amazing video capturing what could be called the climax of Depeche Mode's musical career before Violator.  Unfortunetely, I find much more pleasure listening to the album as it seems more in order.  Waching DM play NLMDA last with Dave's shirt on (when previously he had it off and threw it), really set me off.  Of course I love the DVD and find it very interesting simply for the band.<br />However, with obvious colortiming faults, sound syncs way off, wrong angles for wrong spots...it's a shame a great perforamance that people still dream about could be somewhat not so greatly put together.  The DM 101 music sheets go in order of the DVD (to my emediate memory with out looking through it one more time) but I really find the cut offs in the DVD and such to be a real let down.<br />I still give the DVD 5 out of 5 because it was one of the best concerts the band has put on and the film is GREAT, but just fiddle with the editing, thats all I ask.
B000066F6H|5.0|I'm not sure when it was that I first heard The Hives, but this does not matter. They are a delightfully 1960's reminiscent punk band. I can hear influence of 60's garage rock bands such as The Gants and The Rascals. This album is definitley refreshing after the monotony of today's popular music. Or after anything else for that matter. <BR>     So then, buy this album and rock on with The Hives in their identical yet charming suits! You wont find another band like this anywhere in this day and age, and I do guarantee. Buy all the albums for that matter. Buy everything, my friend!
6302891272|5.0|My name is Tetsuya Iwase and I'm a student in Nagoya International School. I just studied Macbeth and watched Kurosawa's \\"Throne of blood\\".<br />The director of the \\"Throne of Blood\\" Akira Kurosawa showed similar perspectives that William Shakespeare showed in his play Macbeth. The rich language use of Shakespeare was not lost when the play was translated into Japanese language. Kurosawa created a harmony of rich Shakespearean language and Japanese. Kurosawa successfully expressed the theme and motifs that were originally in the Shakespeare's Macbeth. This was probably because of the Bushidou spirit that every Japanese have. Going back into Japanese history, the politician called Nitobe Inazou wrote a book called Bushidou which has an idea of samurai spirit of Japan which tell the loyalty, faithfulness and strong feeling about justice. This book was written to prove to the west that at that time Japan had similar aspects as western countries toward these attributes. In the film, there was strong feeling of justice by Inui against Washizu after he had murdered Ootono to get the throne. It was the same in Macbeth too with Malcolm and Banquo towards Macbeth after his murder of Duncan in order to take the throne. I would definitely recommend this movie and I would recommend to read Macbeth first and to watch. It will probably be easier to understand the movie after reading the novel rather then before.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|This movie definitely gets panned by everyone, even the most die-hard Star Trek fans.  It's usually called \\"the worst of the Star Trek movies,\\" although lately I've heard that Nemesis has taken that title.  But in my opinion, this Trek deserves a chance, and it's not all that bad, and I'd like to defend this movie as not as bad as it's made out to be.<BR>     First, it features the best interaction between \\"the big three.\\"  As much as it can be said that the other characters suffer because the holy trinity of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are more prominently featured, these three characters are really the heart of the show.  Trek V has by far the best interaction and chemistry between the three out of all the movies, very much in the vein of the original series.  The movie also seems very much like an overblown original series episode, which is really not all that bad, especially for someone who loved the original series (which we all do, right?).  <BR>    For almost any Star Trek movie or show, you have to suspend disbelief a little (or in many cases, a lot).  Maybe for this one you have to suspend it a bit more, but if you look at it like that, it's really a fun movie.  It's definitely campy (it *was* directed by William Shatner, after all), and it has the Shatner ego all over it.  Just think about it-  Captain Kirk goes out to find God (although at first reluctantly) and when he finds God, he beats Him!!!  William Shatner beats God.  I always love the scene at the end when Kirk tells McCoy that \\"maybe God's not out there, maybe he is right here\\" and he points at himself...Classic.  And really, if you think about it, it is no more far-fetched than going back in time and bringing whales to the future.  <BR>     I have always loved this movie.  Some of it, I'm sure, is nostalgia-  I saw it in the theatre when I was 9 years old.  But as someone who grew up on the original series (in reruns of course), I really enjoy this one.  You just have to look at it a certain way.  Suspend your disbelief, and look at it as good somewhat campy sci-fi.<BR>    I won't go into the downfalls of the movie, such as the fact that the ship is just falling apart too much, or that the rest of the crew are portrayed as completely stupid idiots (probably again due to Shatner's ego and strained relations with the rest of the cast), or some of the big plot problems, because really all Star Trek movies have their downfalls (though admittedly this one has more than most).  It's still not as bad as it's made out to be.  Hey, it's better than Nemesis!
0345452577|2.0|I suppose not liking this book is my fault.  I was expecting another Alex Delaware and didn't realize this was a &quot;stand alone&quot; type of novel.  Maybe I didn't give this one a chance, but I don't think Conspiracy Club comes even close in character development to the Delaware series.  I wouldn't recommend your purchasing this one but borrowing from your public library.  The story line isn't even that imaginative nor able to captivate and hold your attention for the length of the book.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Ok about the &quot;Quadriology thing&quot; i think the name fits the movies perfectly, personally. THIS IS THE BEST SERIES EVER!  I love it! There isnt anything bad about the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd one in my opinion.  The 4th one could of been better, but its still really cool.  If there is something anyone doesnt understand about Aliens in general just email me at voltron182@hotmail.com i know pretty much everything lol.
0385720920|5.0|Okay, I will admit that I've not come across a book by Chuck Palahniuk that I don't like.  I first visited Fight Club because of the movie - and moved into the realm of Lullaby - Choke I picked up at an airport bookstore in September.  This book caught my attention from the start (as they always do) and sucked me in.  <br />I think what I appreciate the most about this and Palahniuk's other books is that they meld with the ADHD mindset of our generation - and change tracks faster than I change boyfriends.  <br />This is just straight-up good stuff - how can you not fall in love and hate the character who is consciously making money and boosting people's self-esteem at the same time -- how could you possibly not love that?!?!?!

0671004107|5.0|I have been a fan of the movie since it came out in 1997, but everyone who has read the book told me that it is far better than the film. And I agree. As good as the movie is - it is a joke compared to the book! There is far more detail here, which is understandable - if the filmmakers put all the detail that was in the book into the movie, the movie would end up being twelve hours long! For anyone who thinks they dont need to read the book because they've seen the movie: THINK AGAIN! The endings are a lot different. The end of the book has to do with Ellie's mother, stepfather and an idea the aliens gave her, none of which were even in the film.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|Usually sequels are not as good as the originals, sometimes they just flat out suck. This is not the case with X2, in fact it is better than the original. X2 grabs you from the beginning and smacks you around like the naughty child you are with an outstanding opening action sequence where Night Crawler breaks into the White House and tries to send a message to the president. This is by far the best action sequence of the year 2003. With the amazing special effects that actually make Night Crawlers teleporting look real, the exhilarating music track, and a** kicking action, it is obvious from the beginning that this is film making at its finest. <br />The makers of both these films did such a great job in not only making the X-Men seem real, but they were able to present them in a manner that was not corny, and found a way around the multi colored spandex of the comic book. In addition, they stay very true to the comic book and in no where is this more evident in the portrayal of Wolverine and the intense rage he possesses. In fact during the scene when Wolverine was rumbling with the invading special forces in Professor X's school, I almost jumped out of my chair and proclaimed \\"OH GOD, YES!\\"  <br />X2 has great action, great writing, great directing, great production, and great acting. It is a must own and to date the greatest comic book to movie film ever made.
B000009RC2|5.0|This album only reflects off of the great construction of Mahavishnu's music and their superb talent. This album is great in that all songs have the Mclaughlin legacy built into them. Miles Davis kicked, these guys kicked, someone find one album that Mclaughlin was on that isnt amazingly awsome. <br />Throughout this album, it is proven that a fusion song does not have to start out fast to end up like that. Mclaughlin's songs start out mellow and end up a well preogressed fusion/rock song.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!!

B00008O31H|4.0|I pre-ordered this CD, couldn't wait to hear it after playing the Black Keys' first CD, The Big Come-Up, so much I damn near wore it out.<br />Thickfreakness is almost as good. The songs are pretty much on an equal footing with TBCU. The playing is almost as good. What knocks off a star for me is the recording. I liked the recording on the first CD much, much more. It was more authentically 'vintage', to my ears, while the second CD has a more self-conscious lo-fi sound to it. Both CDs are definitely in the lo-fi ballpark, which suits this band very well. But there's something missing from the second CD. As if there's just one layer of grease too many in the mix. The mix is a bit drowned. <br />Anyway, I will go out and buy any CD this band puts out, just to repay the spiritual debt of having so much fun with the first one.
0385504209|5.0|Among the criticisms I have read for this book say that Dan Brown's writing is banal and wooden, and that the reader would do better reading Holy Blood, Holy Grail or Umberto Eco instead. Unfortunately, I am not patient enough to read Umberto Eco. All I needed to know was within the Da Vinci Code. What is so amazing about this novel is that is interweaves fascinating history and trivia in the midst of a highly readable thriller. Something is just about to be revealed at the end of every chapter, so you just have to keep reading. I especially loved the tidbits of trivia interlaced throughout the book, such as explanations of pagan symbology and even references to Walt Disney as a Grail enthusiast. And it doesn't matter that the search seems to be over by the middle of the story when the truth of what the Holy Grail is revealed. I knew who the Holy Grail was before I read this book, and it didn't harm my reading of the story in the least. All in all, I read this book in two days and was astonished by it, enough so to seek other Holy Grail books as well as other Dan Brown novels. One thing I have to say in criticism of Dan Brown: if you've read more than one of his books, you will know that he uses many of the same plot devices. Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code begin in almost identical ways, and Robert Langdon's neverending and surprisingly quick moments of clarity and revelation become really old, but it still doesn't hurt my star count for this book. It IS intelligent. It is a fantastic accomplishemnt. The Da Vinci Code has brought religious history to the masses of the world who feel like having a stroke at the thought of trying to read Umberto Eco novels.

0784011796|2.0|This movie is a classic of the psuedo-intellectual hipster genre. It has the optimal mix of drugs, weirdo-psychotic behavior, and pop mathematics to take the hippy psuedointellectuals on a fanatastic voyage into a world where they matter. The truth is, this movie is more focused on the drugs and the weirdo-psychotic behavior than the math, and so the name &quot;Pi&quot; is misleading. This is not a movie about mathematics nor a mathematician. If is was trying to be, it did a really bad job. Number theory unlocking the secret to the stock market? The number 216? This is not serious mathematics. Hence the movies' plot is meaningless to people who really know what applied mathematics is about--all that is left is the drugs and the weirdo-psychotic nonesense. Two stars.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I've listened to this album for over a month now, and it still is absolutely amazing to me. When I first listened to it, the songs didn't grab me that much, but after the second and third listens, I was completely drawn in. The string arrangements, melodies, and insightful lyrics are simply amazing. I have to say that &quot;When the Body Speaks&quot; is definitely a song that will melt your heart and make you see love in a more intimate way. The string arrangements seem to melt perfectly with Dave's voice in the chorus. That has to be my favorite track on this album. Also, &quot;I am You&quot; is very intoxicating and puts you in a trance; the strings on that song are beautiful as well. For me, all DM albums have something special and unique about them, and I've been hooked on them since age nine. Another song on this album that is very expressive lyrically is &quot;Breathe.&quot; The biblical names and the way Martin ryhmes them and creates this great story is just amazing, yet straight to the point. You will be able to tell that they worked very hard and put their all into this album, as they do with the others. This album is a must-have for anyone who's into introspective and thought-provoking lyrics. Plus, the music is AWESOME!
B00005JMCW|5.0|This is a fantastic funny film that you can actually watch with your kids.  It fosters understanding.  This ninety minute film I believe is a remake of an earlier Disney film.  A busy psychiatrist and widowed mom, Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis), and her musical teenage honor student daughter, Anna (Lindsay Lohan), turn squabbling into an Olympic event.  On the verge of remarrying Tess has a heart to heart talk with Anna in a Chinese restaurant about her recent behavior in school.  In order for each to learn how the other lives a Chinese woman gives them each a fortune cookie which causes them to switch bodies.  So for one freaky Friday the two have to masquerade as each other.  Tess finds out that being a modern teenager isn't as easy as she thought.  Anna finds out that her mother's life isn't as perfect as it seems.  Only selfless love can change the two back.  Mother and daughter grow in love and admiration.  Jamie Lee Curtis is amazing as a teenager.

B0000C1733|4.0|I love the Chili Peppers as much as the next person, but where the heck is &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; on this album?  This is the song that gave the Chili Peppers their breakthrough in 1989, a dedication to their deceased friend (Hillel Slovak, founding guitarist who died of a heroin overdose in 1988), yet they don't add it.  Whatever...<br />&quot;Higher Ground&quot; and &quot;Soul To Squeeze&quot; are great songs, but get rid of &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; or basically anything off of &quot;By The Way&quot; or &quot;Californication.&quot;  The old stuff is the best.  I suggest investing in &quot;What Hits?!&quot; released in 1992.  Better songs, none of this b-s &quot;exploring our musical boundaries&quot; crap they've been playing lately.
B0000VCZK2|1.0|I too have had problems with several discs skipping or stopping in various places on the movies.  Has anyone contacted Fox about this? This is the second box set I have got and both have been defective, in exactly the same spots.  I am using a Denon DVD-2900 which has played hundreds of movies flawlessly, this is the first defective DVD I have ever had. The problem is only when watching Alien or Alien Resurrection when using the DTS soundtrack.  If you watch either of these films using Dolby Digital soundtrack they play flawlessly.
0385504209|3.0|Here's a riddle. We need a five letter word for an orb: &quot;It speaks of rosy flesh and seeded womb&quot;.<br />If you think this is easy, you will not like this book. Unless you like to feel smarter than the best code breakers on earth.<br />In the end, I felt cheated. Should be good for high school kids, though.
0385504209|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read so far. I see a surprising number of reviews on here that disagree, but please be your own judge. You really have to try this book. Love it or hate it, I think it will become a classic. Even if you do not agree with the controversial issues this story brings up, the book still makes you think, especially if you do not take all the details literally (it is a novel afterall). To me the point is, what if something similar has/does happen, you know, the big conspiracy theories. Very entertaining thought to me. I could not set it down. It is really worth a try. A little warning to strict, very religous people, it may be a real shocker and maybe a bit offensive to you (Just remember, it is considered fiction!). I however, completely loved it.
0486266885|5.0|In my opinion, I have found that \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde\\" by Robert Louis Stevenson has been a rather intriguing piece of eighteenth century literature. For this entire piece of literature is seen through the eyes of Mr. Utterson, Dr. Jekyll's best friend.<BR>    If you do not already know, this book is about a good-natured Physician who found himself wanting to be evil.  Thus, he (Dr. Jekyll) begins to experiment with chemicals in order to create a serum that will make him take on a different form (so he will not ruin his reputation or get prosecuted for his wrongdoings) and allows him become evil; Dr. Jekyll names his evil half Mr. Hyde.   <BR>    After Mr. Hyde commits murder, Dr. Jekyll stops taking the serum; however, Dr. Jekyll would find himself changing into Mr. Hyde during the evening.  It was too late, for Mr. Hyde's evil intentions became more dominant than the good-natured intentions of Dr. Jekyll. <BR>    Ashamed at what he had done and running low on chemicals, Dr. Jekyll begins to recreate the serum in order to cease the process of becoming Mr. Hyde.  Upon recreating the serum, Dr. Jekyll finds out that the salt he used for the experiment was impure and that batch out salt is no longer available.  In the end, Dr. Jekyll commits suicide leaving only his notes on the case study of Mr. Hyde as well as Mr. Hyde's lifeless corpse.  <BR>    In retrospect, I conclude that this book might be difficult to read for those who are younger than fourteen or for those who have a disliking for eighteenth century literature.  I have arrived to this conclusion due the fact that most of the sentences are extremely detailed and use scientific phrases.  One may need to reread a paragraph in order to understand its full meaning.<BR>    On the other hand, the book was very well written which makes it easier for one to conjure up an image of what is going on in the text.  Not to mention that each chapter leaves the reader in suspense until the next chapter is read.  I recommend that people who are in love with a good mystery should read this book because the plot progresses at a steady pace.  One could read this book in four days, reading one and a half hours each day.
0790742780|3.0|I watched Falling Down once on USA Network and love the whole concept where the white male is the victim in the movie. Rarely does Hollywood portray the white male star as the antagonist of society. Throughout the movie, he is attacked by three sociological factors: government (laid off from the defense department), family (wife divorced him 'cause of his aggressive and dominant behavior) and culture (confronting various ethnic groups in downtown Los Angeles). These events leads to a chain reaction which causes D-Fens downward fall in society, even though he claims that he is doing the right thing.<br />Michael Douglas did an exceptional job portraying the monster in every white-collar worker in this country. I'd suggest if you have a really bad day at work, watch this movie for anger management (or any Adam Sandler movie will do).<br />And yeah, thanks for the DVD advice. I'll consider purchasing it after the holidays.
B000066HI4|5.0|I stumbled on this album by hopping from list to list on Amazon. It caught my eye and I read the reviews on it and purchased it without even so much as hearing a track performed by Bonnie Prince Billy or any of his various other incarnations. Admittedly, the first song, &quot;A Minor Place&quot; is kind of a dud in my opinion. It generally annoys me but a few times as of late, it has seemed a better song. The rest of the album, however, is all beautiful, haunting tracks featuring Oldham's amazing song-writing and his simple voice that seems as old as time itself. <br />Some of the particularly strong tracks on this album include Nomadic Revery, I See A Darkness, Today I Was An Evil One, and Black. And for the record, track 4 is called &quot;Another Day Full of Dread&quot;, not Bread. <br />Quite simply, this is an album with a beauty and haunting quality that cannot be described with words. It is also some of the best music to listen to while drinking with a close friend.
B000002NG7|5.0|Real music for real listeners.
0676973779|5.0|This book is wonderful, absolutely wonderful! You may hear a lot of different things about it, and it may not sound very good, because it's hard to explain what's so great about this book. But you should give it a shot. I promise it won't take you very long to read. The book has so much depth and wonder to it.
0553213105|5.0|I thought that this book was a great book.  I liked the characters and also the plot.  My favorite chapter was chapter ten of volume three.  This chapter is about Mrs. Gardiner writing to Elizabeth and telling her about what Mr. Darcy did for his sister.  This letter showed Elizabeth Darcy's true character and how much he really cared for her.  I think that because of the letter Elizabeth was able to confirm the feelings she had towards Mr. Darcy.<br /> This book is appropriate for teenagers and up because Pride and Prejudice has characters with these ages.  Elizabeth, Jane and also the Darcy's and the Bingley's were around their twenties.  Elizabeth younger sisters were teenagers.  The other characters were around their thirties, forty's, fifty's and maybe sixties.  Their actions and some of the events that happened with them can be related to some of the things that sometimes happen to us.<br /> A literary device that it is used in the story is allegory.  Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings and events stand for abstract or moral concepts.  Allegorical references are made towards the moral issue of marriage when the Bennett family is disgraced because Lydia has run away with Wickham without the benefit of marriage.<br /> I really liked this book because I was able to picture in my mind everything that was going on in the story.  Jane Austen is able to bring images and pictures to my mind because she was descriptive, and she also used long dialogues for the characters.  I liked the romances and misunderstandings about the main characters because it made the story interesting and it made me wonder what was going to happen in the next chapter.  I enjoyed reading the story and also learned about some problems which women confronted in the 19th century such as entailment, which was the main conflict of the story.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a wrenching novel. The words are laid out plainly, and though not a challenging read, hit every nerve they intend to. The plot is described wonderfully in the editorial reviews. All I can say is, read the passages amazon provides.<BR>I am moved to tears every time I read it, and this is from a single man without children. Parents may think differently.
0380789019|4.0|I had a Gaiman-fest this autumn. I bought American Gods, Neverwhere and Stardust.  While I found American Gods a bit overdone, I adored Stardust for its clearly faceted and sharply written prose and I love Neverwhere for its enjoyable setting, entertaining characters and plot speed.<br />That being said, I don't hate American Gods and still recommend it, but Neverwhere in my opinion is the more enjoyable ride.  I do recommend visiting the London Underground as a primer - it really is its own world down there; I have great childhood memories of looking out the window of the train and seeing little vignettes of the subterranean world flash by in shades of green and red and sketchy black. That's probably why I thorougly enjoyed this read!<br />It is a true fantasy on the order of Alice in Wonderland, or the Matrix or any of the 'step through the gate' type tales stretching back for god knows how many centuries. It is the kind of fairyland your grandmother knew about - not all fairies are nice...that's why you wear a charm :-). The two villians who are hunting for the protagonist are truly nasty AND hugely funny too (mmm rats)!<br />So if you want a modern-grit, fast plotted, fun fantasy novel, pick this one up!
B0000CDLA7|1.0|IMO, after ACOS nothing has worked for DT. It is as if that insult that was FII had pressed them to try to fix it pretending to please their progressive fans. But being classified as progressive (or as anything) should be the result of songwriting, not the purpose. That is why their songs are long, boring, fast but soulless. A song must be composed to sound well (a definition that is left up to the reader), not to comply with rigid schemes.
0142000663|4.0|While I do not share John Steinbeck's view of the world (politics), I do think he is an excellent writer.  I don't see how anyone can not be drawn to the characters in this book.  The ability of Steinbeck to paint a picture with words is almost unmatched.  I think this book is a must-read, a must-read indeed!
0471413909|1.0|Cordain's book is long on speculation and error and very short on data.<br />He would have you eat protein at levels just a hair short of toxicity for your entire life! Don't do this if you value your health.<br />Cordain suggests that no vegetarian diet could come close to the nutrient levels he provides in his sample diet plan. This is spectacularly wrong--any plant-based diet that centers on dark leafy greens rather than whole grains will provide more of everything (except B12) with fewer calories, more fiber, more good carbohydrate,  and less saturated fat, in a way that is more health-promoting, and will result in much better blood lipid profiles and is far more likely to reduce incidence of certain types of cancers.<br />Cordain would also have you cook with flax oil.  This is also spectacularly wrong.<br />The idea of reducing grains is not bad--simply because they are not as nutrient dense as vegetables and fruits, but the idea of jacking up animal flesh to ridiculously toxic levels to take their place is a very very bad one--not only for one's health, but also for the planet.<br />If you want to try something health-promoting, consider a 10% animal, 90% plant diet--center your calorie needs around dark leafy greens and purples, non-starchy non-leafy vegetables and fungi, starchy roots and tubers, raw fruit, and raw nuts and seeds in descending order, lightly supplemented with lean and fatty fish, other lean seafood, and perhaps some cultured nonfat dairy and modest quantities of sprouted grains and legumes. Emphasize genetic diversity with a wide variety of bright colors on the plate. This is a much healthier option to follow.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|I first saw this classic on the big screen at the age of 13 when it was released in the U.S.  My most vivid memory of the film is the scene where Cheyenne terrorizes Frank's henchmen from atop a moving train, making good use of his boot!<br />I also studied the film in a college film class and discovered how Leone created so many of the unique looks in the film.<br />All in all, I've probably seen this movie 30 times, and now that I own the DVD, I'll probably watch it another 30 times.  I would rate it the #2 best Western of all time, right behind Unforgiven.  And remember... people scare better when they're dying.
B000001OAA|5.0|This definitely is the best Garbage Album that was released.  Self titled Garbage, each track is very original with unique lyrics that range from many emotions.   <br />1.Supervixen:  this song is very good.  The electric guitar does have some good solos.  Also, the vocals of Shirley shine in this piece.<BR>\\"If you like it to much, you can always pull out...\\"<BR>4/5<br />2.Queer: one of the songs that was released as a single, the song isn't much driven by frantic guitar or percussion but rather a much more mellow feel.  This song does a great job of catching audiences as it does have a very memorable melody.<BR> \\"Learn to love the pain you feel, like father and son...\\"<BR>4/5<br />3.Only Happy when it Rains: this song is driven by the sound of the electric guitar accompanied by rather softer percussion beats.  Another released single from this album, this song yet provides with another catchy tune with distinct lyrics.<BR> \\"I only smile in the dark, my only comfort is the night gone black...\\"<BR>4/5<br />4.As heaven is Wide: this song has frantic drum machine sounds.  One of the haunting songs within this CD, but is less memorable of them all.  The vocals are very hard to hear in this piece because the layering of the instrumentation over powers Shirley.<BR>\\"If holy is as holy does...takes your conscience as it falls...\\"<BR>2/5<br />5.Not My Idea: this track has a great drive by the guitars as well as nice percussion beats.  The lyrics and the melodic structure are very likeable and has become one of my favorites.  <BR>\\"You thought that I would never see what was meant for you was meant for me...\\"<BR>5/5<br />6.A Stroke of Luck: this piece is very haunting.  It is a ballad, well a ballad that is meant for Garbage.  It is great; the instrumentation is very haunting and dramatic.  The vocals are well done in this piece, as well as the melodic structure of this piece. Very good chorus as well.<BR> \\"Nothing could seem to touch me...Did you know I was lost until you found me...\\"<BR>5/5<br />7.Vow: another released single from this album that is a great piece overall. This song has a great drive through strong guitar instrumentation.  The percussions drive is also helpful to portray this song's hardcore driven emotion of revenge.<BR> \\"I came to shut you up, I came to drag you down...\\"<BR>5/5<br />8.Stupid Girl: another released single that is one of the best tracks in this CD.  The Bass line, percussion, electric guitar, and melodic structure of the lyrics is very memorable.  They all help to make this piece very good.  <BR> \\"What drives you on, can drive you mad...\\"<BR>5/5<br />9.Dog New Tricks: this piece does have nice guitair accompaniments but the rest all falls short within this piece.  The lyrics aren't good, nor is the melodic structure.  Least favorite track.<BR>\\"Dog New Tricks, You make me feel so worthless...\\"<BR>2/5<br />10.My Lover's Box:  this piece has nice percussion as well as electric guitar accompaniment.  The lyrics are great, especially with Shirley's vocals.  This piece shows her vocals and how they can be very soft and angelic like even during a rock driven song.<BR>\\"My lover's charms are in a box...cherish them, until the very end...\\"<BR>5/5<br />11.Fix Me Now: this piece has very strong percussion beats and one very distinguishable guitar melody.  The lyrics and melodic structure though is very forgettable.  Another least memorable track that I easily skip to move onto the next song.  The only thing that can keep me to listen to the entire track is the Chorus which is opposite from the entire track.<BR>\\"bring me back to life, fix me now..\\"<BR>2/5<br />12.Milk: this piece is the slowest song on this album.  It has a nice melodic structure help created by the keyboards.  The instrumentation is very haunting, as well as the vocals.<BR>\\" I am lost, so I am cruel, but I would be love and sweetness if I had you...\\"<BR>5/5<br />Compared to Garbage's other album, this album has definitely has to be the greatest.  This CD shows the original direction that garbage was heading towards.  I would recommend this CD for all fans of garbage, or even to those who are looking for an alternative group.
B000050FEN|1.0|Pitt, never what you would really call an actor, turns in a performance here that is nothing short of amazing, if you rule out the fact that no police department in the country would hire someone with Tourette's who appears to neither shave nor bathe very often.<br />The storyline has all the depth and literacy of the last fourteen slasher movies you saw, which is appropriate because this is basically a fancy slasher movie.<br />Morgan Freeman basically provides the only element of sanity in this movie.  He often looks at Pitt in disbelief as though he were thinking, &quot;They pay you to do this?&quot;<br />Putrid, disgusting, formless, meaningless, and needlessly excessive, this is an example of modern Hollywood at its worst. Avoid at all costs.
B000099T2L|2.0|All these collabos with commercial rappers is sickening. This is a solo debut so actually do a song by your self beyonce. The only props I give you is for Me, Myself, and I. This album sucks. I hate it when an artist tries to record all these commercial hits with other commercial artists. This album brings r/b and soul music to shame.

6305229449|5.0|It is my daughters favorite movie.  It came in the origian shrink packaged case.  I have eatched it several times with my six children they all enjoy it over and over again.  That is why I rated it a 5 star product.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I am a young person and personally never have been a fan of jazz.  I must say there is something pure, tranquil, calming, and soulful about Norah's voice. The cd overall will relax you and is not a fast-paced cd. <br />She definitely stands out as different than other artists. One of my friend's told me that the only thing that has calmed her nerves and life when things aren't going so well was listening to Norah's cd!<br />Some of my favorite songs are &quot;The Nearness of You&quot;, &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;. For a faster song, go for &quot;I've Got To See You Again.&quot; <br />Can't wait for her new album due Feb 2004.
B00000K3CM|4.0|OK, after this one, I would have stopped. There are another two sequels after this one, and at this one the story is already getting tired. You know Kevin's going to get lost, you know he's going to enjoy the excitement of being alone, but then misses his mum (big awwwwwwww everyone!), and you know the mum's going to find him in the end.<br />What I didn't expect was Harry &amp; Marv (Joe Pesci and the other guy) to not appear as much as the previous film. They appeared very rarely, and only came properly into the film later on. But they were as great as ever. Although's there's only so many times you can watch a guy get hit in the crotch, and still find it funny - but I cross my legs everytime, and I'm female! There were some funny bits when Kevin was throwing everything he could lay his hands on at them - the funniest I found was Marv getting covered in dust and then sneezing!<br />The fabulous Brenda Fricker plays a great role in this as the Bird Lady, who originally scares Kevin, but then they become friends. It's a small role, but she's suited to it - and she scared me too! :(<br />And of course, who could forget the brilliant Tim Curry? He pops up a lot in films, and I never seem to tire of him - except when he's in the bad guy role. He was brilliant in this, and so overly camp - can I please have a tape measure to see how high that hair is? The bit where Kevin's mum slapped him was classic - especially when he looked like he was going to cry.<br />You've got all the old characters from the previous film, who thankfully, don't get too much focus in the film - they really annoy me. But I suppose that's the point really.<br />Another great Christmas movie, with a sad ending, but the directors really should have known when to end - stop while they were ahead, and the formula doesn't become old and tired. Although Macaulay Culkin isn't in the next two, so that may make a difference - but the storyline is tired and overdone.
6305907145|4.0|I never read the book but an adaptation is something that is changed so as to become suitable to a new or special application or situation. <br />I never heard of it except that I enjoy Jane Austen books/movies and looked into other books she wrote etc. I enjoyed the movie. I agree some parts in the movie were flung on you and were too graphic to be included. <br />The main character was witty, intelligent, yet fun and endearing. It was enjoyable to see the story of true friendship unfold and how the main characters feelings finally are acknowledged. I love the language and overall thought it was a great movie. Good ending but it does leave you wanting more.
0743216458|5.0|The book Band of Brothers by Stephen E. Ambrose is a chilling tale that takes place on the bloody battlefeilds of WWII. This bbook follows E. company through the early stages of training at Curahee, to there drop into Normandy on the early morning of D-day, to an assult on a 4 fixed German positions that were firing on Utah beach,through Holland, the battle of the bulge, to the liberation of a German concentration camp called Duachu, and finally to Hitlers suposivaly impenitrable Eagles nest at Berchester garden. Out of Easy's 147 men they suffered 150 percent casulties. The book mainly focuses on the bond that forms between the men of E. company and doesn't focus on the actual war itself. But dont worry the book still tells alot about the war. All the men of E. company voulnteered to be there. It wasnt just the extra 50 dollars a month they recieved it was the thought that they were the best the US army hade to offer. They didnt want to be stuck next to some draftee who didnt know what he was doing when to pull the triggger.<BR> On another note the story follows Second Lieutenant Winters as he leads E. company and later becomes a Major. The men in E. company all gained Winters trust and would follow Winters through thick and thin. Winters was a born leader. Hes the kind of guy that you would want leading you intop battle.<BR>  If you learn more about what E. company experienced you can watch the movie. The movie has a running time of about 10 hours and it includes special documemteres on some of the orignal members. I hoped you found this review helpful and consider reading this book.Thank you.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|As many here I have been an unconditional fan of Sarah for years. Like many too my favourite album from Sarah is &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;. Yes, &quot;Afterglow&quot; was not fully what I expected, but in spite of that it still is a good album if you compare it to the stuff that is released from other people. The lyrics are not as good, but I still find some very good pieces of lyrics among these songs. For me some of the best songs in this album are &quot;Fallen&quot;, &quot;World on Fire&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Perfect Girl&quot;. Sarah's voice is also beautiful as ever and the instrumental arrangements are very good. I have seen other great female songwriters/performers (for example Tori Amos and Heather Nova) having not so good albums out. Let's hope this one is an exception and that Sarah does hear what her fans have to say about the quality of her work. I think she will. Last, but not least, if you truly love Sarah's voice and her previously released work it is worthwhile to buy this cd.
6304366086|5.0|I totally agree with the above review. This film needs to be on DVD. Released in 70MM format for Cinerama, I can't imagine a better basis for a DVD than this all time great racing movie. By far my favorite movie, I was fortunate enough to see it when it was released at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, and what an impact this film made on me. I look on the net several times a year searching for the news that it will be released on DVD. I'm ready. Bring it on !!<BR>Come on Warner Bros, give us the DVD!
B00005Y7GQ|5.0|Very funny! One of the funniest in my book. The US version is to be heavily edited. Do yourselves a favor and watch the original Chinese version the way it was meant to be seen!
0385504209|1.0|The worst part of this book was the extremely short, choppy chapters.  It drove me crazy.  The story line had a lot of potential but the book just did not deliver.  I was very disappointed that I wasted my money.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is definitely the version of the film that you want to see. With over 40 minutes of extra footage, this version of Peter Jackson's Academy Award Winning film is deeper and fuller and closer to the book. Although Tolkien purists do not care for the changes Jackson made to Frodo's story line and the character of Faramir, Jackson otherwise captures the spirit of Tolkien's second part to The Lord of the Rings. Among the extra scenes are: a sequence with Merry and Pippin which draws from &quot;Old Man Willow&quot; in book of Fellowship of the Ring; a very helpful and interesting conversation between Gandalf and Aragorn about Aragorn's destiny; more of Frodo and Sam; more of Treebeard and the Ents (including their attack on the orcs in Fangorn Forest); and the delightful chapter from the book, &quot;Flotsam and Jetsam.&quot; There are also HOURS of documentary material which show just how much work it really took to produce such a great film.

0385507755|4.0|First off, let me get something off my chest ... the \\"Top 1000\\" review really irritates me.  She seems to base her review on her own bouts with addiction and there is thinly veiled resentment towards Mr. Frey that he had parents that cared (he, on the other hand, didn't even want their help, partially out of shame for what he had become).  Additionally, she mocks his writing style, which maybe *she* doesn't like but I felt it works quite well for him.  She also called him spoiled, implying that he took a whiny tone throughout the book and that this is some tale of a Hollywood star going to a recreational center.  Let me tell you though - this is the story of Frey going to the edge of life or death.  The characters are hard-core, the settings often disturbing.  Imagine you are an addict and have been told if you drink one more drink you will die.  That is basically the choice that Frey faces.  So I don't know what bug Ms. Top 1000 reviewer got up her butt, but she completely misrepresents the story.  There, I got that off my chest! :) For me, I enjoyed the book thoroughly and it was quite thought provoking for me.<br />This book is great on several levels:  <BR>1) It is a fascinating story, well told using a unique writing style.<BR>2) It gives a different solution for dealing with addiction.  Frey realizes that he could not use traditional crutches such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, etc. and that he must take a different (and non-sanctioned, non-recommended) path or philosophy towards recovery.<BR>3) The other characters he meets along the way are also quite interesting and lend a lot to the story.  It is interesting to hear what happens to them in real life.<br />Just a good read all around, especially if you have had any interest in addiction.
B000069AUI|5.0|Now this is what I call a wonderful surprise. I wasn't really expecting this CD to be what it actually was. I loved the video &quot;The Scientist&quot;, and that was the reason why I bought this CD. But soon I found out that &quot;The Scientist&quot; wasn't the only fantastic song in here. &quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot;, &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot;, &quot;Green Eyes&quot; and &quot;In My Place&quot;, together with &quot;The Scientist&quot;, are some of the best songs I've ever listened, really. Sometimes sentimental, romantic, strong, cricitizing politicians and what they do against our peace, our planet.<BR>Coldplay is, at the same time, a band with wonderful songs, worried with the planet, a band with nice guys. It is a very rare to find a band like that. I'm probably going to get lots of non-helpful votes because of this, but I actually find these guy's songs much better than the, also english, The Beatles, the &quot;immortal&quot; band everyone talks about, and they will ever talk about. Sure they are awesome too, but Coldplay could go even further in that level, due to great lyrics and great attitude, so this CD is a must for any music fan, a masterpiece.
B000001G16|5.0|I've recommended this cd to at least 15 people that have purchased and fell in love with it immediately.  It's not a slick, over-mastered bubblegum piece of fluff.  This is a deep, mesmerizing and bluesy recording right down to the roots of rock and roll.  Melodies flow smoothly from one to another and Richie's dark smoky voice makes this one perfect experience of listening pleasure.  It's from the soul and you feel it completely.  Harkens back to those slow evenings sitting at a corner table in a blues bar when nothing is pressing and everything is good and right as the sound flows over you and pulls you into the experience.  Buy it--you'll love it!
078322737X|4.0|Just saw this last night on AMC and took special note of the cars featured since they are a HUGE part of the plot, as each person's car defines their character:<br />1958 Chevrolet Impala - white.  Ron Howard's car that gets stolen and stolen back.  Great white/red &quot;tuck and roll&quot; upholstry.  Notice that even the dashboard is tuck and roll - custom work, not from the factory.<br />1958 Edsel 4-door hardtop (I think it's a Citation, or the top-of-the-line model) - turquoise.  Cindy Williams' car.  Nerdy - probably belonged to her parents.<br />1932 Ford - yellow.  The famous &quot;little deuce coupe&quot; that Paul LeMat drives/races.  Looks like a miniature piston that serves as a shift knob.  Note that this car has been &quot;chopped,&quot; i.e. a section of the roof pillars has been removed to make the top lower.  Very cool car.  The maroon-colored Mercury that the Pharohs drive around in has also been &quot;chopped,&quot; it appears.<br />1955 Chevrolet - black.  Harrison Ford's car and the one that crashes to the tune of &quot;Green Onions&quot; at the climax of the film.  This is a basic 2-door sedan, not a fancy Bel Air hardtop.<br />1960? - Citroen Deux Chaveaux - blue.  This is Richard Dreyfuss' car - too nerdy to cruise in.  Nowadays it's a cult classic.  I think it's a 2-cylinder engine with (really) 12 horsepower.  The canvas roof folds right up to provide sun and air.<br />1956 Ford Thunderbird - white.  Suzanne Somers' car, probably the most famous vehicle in the film. <br />1960 Cadillac Sedan deVille - white.  This is the car that McKenzie Phillips and Paul LeMat hit at the stoplight, spraying it with shaving cream and deflating the tires.<br />Late '50s/early '60s VW Beetle cabriolet - red.  Seen early in the film as Richard Dreyfuss and his ex-girlfriend have a little discussion in the &quot;aft chamber,&quot; i.e. the backseat.<br />Other cars prominent in the film are a 1961 Ford 4-door (the cops' car that gets its rear end &quot;removed,&quot; a 1961 Ford Falcon station wagon (white), a 1960 Chevrolet Impala (the white 2-door that the gentleman gets out of at the liquor store) and a copper-colored 1957 Chevrolet.  These last 3 do &quot;double duty&quot; in the cruising scenes and also in the used car lot as Richard Dreyfuss proves himself to the hoodlums he's hanging out with.<br />Very accurate use of cars in the film - good stuff!
B00007BHOE|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said by the other reviews about this DVD. It's the best damn DVD I've ever purchased. Every track sung on it is undescribable. Obviously, the best part was the solo Joey did. If you're a SlipKnot fan, GET THIS DVD!!! You'll get your money's worth.
B00004R99K|5.0|I have loved this ALICE IN WONDERLAND since childhood, so perhaps I am biased...but I simply cannot agree with those who find it one of Disney's lesser movies.  The witty dialogue, the delightful songs, the brilliant vocal acting from the entire cast (Ed Wynn does the voice of the Mad Hatter:  how clever!), and (last but not least) the splendidly bright colors all seem to perfectly evoke the whimsical mood of the original Lewis Carroll tale.  <BR>If you do like the movie, I would recommend also buying the soundtrack CD (which is, admittedly, a bit hard to find right now), because the cleverness of the score is easier to appreciate when heard on its own, without the visuals.  Enjoy!
B000021YQV|5.0|I own this album and have continually listened to it of about a year and a half, and to me it never dissapoints. At one time, I kept playing this album for a straight week to see if I would get bored, and I didn't. But that's just me. I forgot to mention this album as one of the best albums in 2001. Also check out Steal this Album and the STD (Self Titled Debut) of the band.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I think &quot;Aliens&quot; is the best Sci-Fi movie ever made.  The third and fourth entries are big let-downs.  They made a mistake by killing Newt and the other guy (Reese?) before the third movie.  I think Mr. Cameron should just pretend the third and fourth movies never happened and make his own next chapter; perhaps taking the three of them to the Alien home planet.
B0000028M7|5.0|I finally got a chance to listen to this CD all the way through, and I love it. Them Bones is a great track to open for the album. Dam That River is another awesome track. Obviously, to me, the first six tracks are the best songs I've heard in a LONG TIME to open for the track. I'll admit that some of the songs do leave something to be desired (ex. God Smack, Junkhead) but there are enough songs on this CD for me to give it five stars. When I wrote past reviews for this CD, I really didn't get a chance to listen to it all, I only got to listen to Them Bones and Rooster, and I thought that just because that I'd listened to those, that I had pretty much listened to the whole album. I WAS AN IDIOT! But now that I've listened to this CD fully, it is one of the best CD's I own. The final three tracks (Hate to Feel, Angry Chair, and Would?) are my favorites on this CD. I really can't say enough about \\"Would?\\". It is THE BEST CLOSER TO AN ALBUM I'VE EVER HEARD!! To me, it felt like I was listening to three an a half minutes of greatness. And then at the end when Layne just screams \\"IF I WOULD COULD YOU?\\" it kind of felt like the floor just fell out from under me. I can't stop listening to this album. I wish I could give it higher than five stars on this review. Oh well. Layne Staley, you always will be missed.
B00008WG3U|5.0|This CD flat out rips.  In my opinion, it's their best since Ribbed. I personally love the political slant; it's not overbearing, and for the most part, it's intelligent and true.  &quot;The Idiots are taking over&quot; has become my theme song, and sometimes I swear, they wrote that song with me in mind, driving down the freeway, stuck in traffic.  As an old, old punk, I can firmly relate to Mattersville, it sounds like a wonderful place.  She's nubs, the irrationality of Rationality, We got two jealous agains, I could go on and on, this CD is packed with great tunes.  <br />It's a great album.  Buy it, support genuine punk rock.
B00004Z459|5.0|Break the Cycle, Machine, and Hybrid Theory were in my opinion the three best CDs that came out in 2001. Hence the fact that they were on the Family Values 2001 Tour with Stone Temple Pilots and Deadsy. But about Hybrid Theory, it is a great album to listen to. One of the few bands to pull off a hybrid of rap and rock, which are two of the biggest genres in music today. You'll like the album. Think of it as a softer version of SlipKnot.
B000063DHL|5.0|With songs like \\"Caught somewhere in time\\", \\"Wasted Years\\" and \\"Stranger in a strange land\\" this album is definitely Iron Maiden's best hour.<br />UP THE IRONS!!!!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw this show back in June when it was previewing in San Francisco. I had no expectations of this show. I had not read the book, I just knew it was based on the witches of Oz before Dorothy droped in. I was blown away...(No Tornado needed!) <BR>The show is incredible. Kristen Chenoweth is extremely entertaining as Glinda... her comic timing is superb...but vocally, it's Idina Menzel that won my heart. From the moment she sings her first song, \\"The Wizard and I\\" you get goose bumps. Her voice is powerful and she sings every song with conviction. With her closing number to Act 1, \\"Defying Gravity\\" (which will send chills down your spine) I knew this show was going to be a hit. I turned to my friend at intermission and said, \\"This show will win the Tony for Best Musical 2003 and I have to see it again.\\" I went to the box office during intermission and bought tickets to see the closing performance before it left S.F. The show was just as magnificent the second time. <BR>The songs are terrific... This is the first show in a long time that I have left the theater singing the songs. I have been waiting since June for this CD to be released, and I am not disappointed. <BR>To say that I love this show is an understatement. Run, don't walk... no, FLY to see this show...(your friends will be GREEN with envy!) and if you can't make it to NYC any time soon... BUY THIS C.D......it's \\"Wonderful\\". The other musical highlights include: \\"Popular\\", \\"For Good\\", \\"One short day\\". Enjoy!!!
0141439513|4.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a book based in the 19th century in England. It was based on the era when money, pride, love, and marriage arrangements had to be the best and the most important thing. In this book the major conflict was their pride and prejudice of the main characters. The book's main characters were the Bennet Family, Bingley, and Darcy. The Bennet family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, their daughters Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia. As this story starts we meet all of them along with others minor characters. We find out that they are all concerned about social classes.<br />The best chapter in this book is when Darcy and Elizabeth become engaged. To me it is the best chapter because that shows that they overcame their pride and prejudice. These two characters were deeply in love but couldn't show it to each other not only because of their own pride and prejudice, but also because their family and acquaintances had influenced them wrongly.<br />The literary device I appreciate is comedy. A comedy, in general, is a story that ends happily. The hero or heroine of a comedy is usually an ordinary character who overcomes a series of obstacles that block what he or she wants. It's usually a plot where two young people meet and fall in love. The young lovers must face obstacles to their marriage. At the end of the story Elizabeth and Darcy overcome their conflicts to get together and be able to show their feelings towards each other.<br />I like and recommend this book to anyone who likes to read love books with a little comedy. This book is age appropriate for teens and older people because it gives you a chance to appreciate the differences in lifestyles and beliefs in the 19th century from those of today. This book makes you think of how people believed women had only one future<br /> in life, and that was getting married and raising a family.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Man, whoever says this Alicia Keys CD sucks is crazy. She did such a good job on this album! She has really improved as an artist, and people now a days are way to critical. I mean, if your not sexy enough your criticized, and if ya take off ya clothes, your some kind of [...]. I think most people dont have a clear perception of what talent is because they are too dang busy judging looks and worrying about their personal lives. Alicia is an amazing talented artist, like Beyonce, Tamia, and India Arie. For instance, Beyonces actions, such as less clothes and more skin, are a reflection of what society looks for, even though its one big controdiction when presented to that same society. We should really be judging her voice, which is beautiful. Oh well, Alicia, if your reading, keep doin what cha doin. People are always gonna hate, but you will always be you. Stay true and keep goin girl. You got this! Im Feeling ya and Loving IT!
B00005JMFI|5.0|This just might be my new favorite Christmas movie.  <BR>A tie at the very least.<br />I should mention that I NEVER spend money to go to a theater and watch this type of comedy ... but I did - and I AM SO GLAD!<br />Also, you should know that I am pretty picky and it takes a lot to get a thumbs up from me.  The movie wasn't even over when I leaned over and whispered to my friend that I need to get Elf on DVD as soon as it comes out.  <br />I laughed and laughed and laughed...<br />I still laugh remembering my favorite scenes.  I kept breaking out in random giggles at work the day after I saw it.  People thought I'd lost it - but they had all seen the movie so all I had to do was tell them what scene I was recalling and they started laughing rignt along with me.<br />Smart comedy, a wonderfully written story, great acting and all of the happiness this season should hold - all wrapped up in one wonderful Christmas package.  Go see it - bring your friends, your family or just some candy canes and syrup...<BR>you'll be glad you did.<br />It's sweet AND good for you!
B000001EHS|4.0|This is an awesome album to introduce you to one of the greatest bands of all time. This is the album that introduced me to them, but if you want the full experience go and buy some of the individual albums. They are all great. This album contains many of their best songs. Too many off of Hysteria. Although it would be another hysteria song it needs Women
0385508417|3.0|With their daughter off to Peru with the Peace Corps, Luther Krank and his somewhat-willing wife Nora have decided to skip Christmas this year.  After totalling last years damage at over $6,000, with little to show for it, they decide to take a Carribbean cruise instead of spending money on gifts, parties, and decorations.  The main problem, however, is that Hemlock Street is one of the most festive steets in town during the holiday season.  And their neighbors on Hemlock Street aren't too pleased with the Krank's decision.<br />I think many people can relate to the Krank's desire to avoid the busy pace of Christmas, although Luther is perhaps a bit extreme.  But with the hectic feeling the holidays bring, I felt as envious as Luther's co-workers as he prepared for his upcoming cruise.  And while the neighbors reaction was initially funny, as Luther digs in his heels and things on Hemlock Street begin to get a bit ugly, the story became somewhat uncomfortable and tense.  But, of course, there's a happy ending, and while it's no Christmas classic, it was a nice easy read with a holiday theme.
B000005JAB|5.0|To echo one of the reviews, I know idea what the songs are about.  And it really doesn't matter.  The overall mood and atmosphere they create is more important than any meaning.  The songs give you an amazing sense of listening to a weary traveler, and make you nostalgic for your own past journeys.  The songs kind of remind me of Leonard Cohen's &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot; and the Horseflies &quot;Sally Ann&quot; in that they're apocalyptical in their subject.  What are they singing about?  Who knows, it isn't important.<br />My only complaints, and they are minor and don't justify giving this album any less than five stars, is the length, only 33 minutes.  And some of the songs have orchestration that is too lush sounding, especially the title track.  But they're minor complaints.  Every song is fantastic, but especially &quot;A Child's Christmas in Wales&quot; and the last two songs: &quot;Half Past France&quot; and &quot;Antarctica Starts Here,&quot; two of the greatest songs ever written.
B00006690G|5.0|First of all, if you read my other review on this CD,I said it was his worst album,but I changed my mind,I listened to it all the way through and actually found it more enjoyable than his previous albums. If you were lucky like me, You might have got a copy with a bonus DVD. The best songs are Superman,cleaning out my closet,Till I collapse,when the music stops,soldier,and Buisness. If you are an Eminem fan,or a rap fan,you probably will like this album.

B0000DZEA1|1.0|I have a huge soundtrack collection and had previously bought the Fellowship and Two Towers soundtracks.  I could not wait to hear the music in Return Of The King.  Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I found the music in this film to be week, diluted and un-melodic by comparison.  Watching the film, I was amazed by the epic splendor.  The troops marching into battle, ultimate good and evil, heartfelt moments, romance.  These were opportunities to create great marches, fantastic battle music, themes of friendship, love themes.  Instead what we get is weak, almost random chords, fiddle solos as horses charge into battle and other inappropriate sounds.  You definitely do not leave the theater humming any of the music.  The Annie Lenox song sounds like it was written out of her range and is grating to say the least.  I'm sure Howard Shore had his heart in the right place, but frankly I've heard student films that had better scores then this.  Fortunately, the movie is fantastic enough that it can suffer the substandard music.
B00006LJ6X|4.0|For my money, this is the last great Chicago album.  Afterward Chicago became mostly a singles band.  That is, they would continue to issue enjoyable radio songs; but the rest of the stuff on their records could safely be dismissed.<br />But what a fantastic album this is.  Chicago's instrumental strength is finally allowed to go pedal to the metal.  We do not even get to a vocal until the sixth cut.  So the first five cuts are pure instrumentals in which the band just cooks.  Although the best instrumental comes later on cut nine: the goofy \\"Mongonucleosis\\".  This is just plain jazz with a rock sensibility.  Fun and light.<br />But this is not to say that Chicago shorted fans in the song department.  The two major hits \\"(I've Been) Searchin' So Long\\" and \\"Wishing You Were Here\\" are found here.  But along with these are \\"Call On Me\\", \\"Byblos\\", \\"Women Don't Want To Love Me\\", \\"Skinny Boy\\" and \\"Happy Man\\".  Each is a little gem that shouldn't be left out of any Chicago hits collection.<br />If you are interested in collecting the essential Chicago albums, start with the Chicago Transit Authority, obtain each successive album after that, and finish with this one.  I love each one of those albums.  Each is competent, free feeling, fun and memorable.  I have no real idea what happened after this album was made.  Something major changed and Chicago was never the same again.  After this album, save yourself a lot of trouble and just get a retrospective or \\"greatest hits\\" package for the hits that were to come in the future.<br />All that said, this is a wonderful album.  This version from Rhino includes a bonus cut of a rehearsal version of \\"Byblos\\".  Not essential but still fun in its own way.
B00007ELEL|5.0|They got him, Walter -- they captured him four days ago.  Do you see what happens, Walter?  This is what happens, Walter, when a fig-eater hides in a hole in the ground rather than scrambling to find &quot;reverse&quot; on a Soviet-made tank.
B000001GQB|5.0|You get two discs of the later Mozart Symphonies, which can't be wrong if Bohm and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra are also around. Bohm is a master of tempi, I think, and the orchestra's able to deliver quite a sound. You'll never hear me say that these are the definitive readings, but they are excellent and well worth the effort and are not the lesser of other recordings. <br />Most will be wanting to know whether nos. 40 and 41 are 'in shape'. Sure. The Mozart expert (or anybody, for that matter, if he/she has listened to other performances of the same works) will find moments where opportunities have been missed, but that same listener will discover plenty of things that balance the scale, in the end yielding a (hopefully) positive experience.<br />Now, next to Bohm I do also recommend Szell, Pinnock, and Menuhin. But to lift the veils for 'beginners', Mozart: Symphonies Nos. 35-41, Conducted by Bohm, is an almost sure buy.<br />That sentence where I said that opportunities may have been lost sounds a bit depressing, but few things can please everybody.
6304696515|5.0|This is your normal ladies' soap-opera romance/drama set in The Time Of Costumes -- but Uma Thurman's contribution is noteworthy, and compensates MORE than sufficiently for a guy's time watching this.  So when your wife or girl friend suggests this film, pretend to be a little reluctant, and then give in.  Have a little beer or wine, then relax and wait for Uma's appearance.  You can't miss it!
B0000069CT|5.0|This is an excellent compilation, which includes, of course, the famous 1st Violin Concerto, admirably played by orchestra (Kurt Masur conducting) and violinist Salvatore Accardo.<br />This is a double-disc, and while that 1st concerto can be found on disc 1 (accompanied by the 2nd concerto and Serenade for Violin and Orchestra, Op. 75), disc 2 contains some real surprises (for me, at least): Serenade For Violin and Orchestra, Op. 75 (concl.) and the 3rd Violin Concerto.<br />Other reviewers spoke about the 3rd here, and after giving it ample attention I must say in my very humble opinion that it bears the signs of a possible classic; certainly the first movement is great.<br />That 'mystery' 3rd concerto was for me the reason to buy it, and I hope you'll enjoy it, too. As for the sound ... I think it's fine, not at all shrill to my ears; but that's just me, maybe.<br />Last of all, this CD contains the Scottish Fantasy, Op. 46. Quite a lot of material, while the price is about right ...
B00005JKZV|5.0|&quot;I regret to announce that this is the end. I'm going now, I bid you all...&quot; the best. I sure will miss the rush of expecting more from the LOTR cast, after this, there's no more. I love everything involved with the movie and since I'm a composer (film score composer wanna be someday) I will miss waiting for the december to come...after this, the coming christmas won't be the same. I wish these movies will go on forever, but all WE have to decide is what to do with the experience that the producer and the cast left us with. To me, this has been the best cinematic experience of my life. These movied changed my life and I hope in the years to come anybody who watches the movie will still admire the great talent and work of the whole cast. enough said! 11/25/2003

B0000AXE8I|5.0|While critics have repeatedly knocked Reloaded for not being the Matrix (just like they have knocked the Star Wars prequels for not being like the classic trilogy), I found the movie to be a thrilling, entertaining experience.  It is so rare to find an action movie that has any underlying value that I am thrilled beyond belief whenever one comes along.  <br />As for the comments that it is &quot;not as good as the original,&quot; what sequel is?  Very few sequels can improve upon the perception of the original, and Reloaded is no different.  In the original Matrix, the Wachowskis showed us revolutionary things we had never seen before in American cinema, like bullet time and wired martial arts.   Because the second film uses variations on many of these same techniques, even though the action sequences are still thrilling, we as an audience have lost some of the wonder that accompanied seeing these things for the first time.<br />I don't think we give enough credit to the digital pilgrims like the Wachowskis and George Lucas, whose films pioneer effects that are subsequently replicated and mimicked by dozens of other films.  But I digress.<br />While the film has some slow moments (the Zion sequence, in particular), the &quot;burly brawl&quot; and freeway chase sequences should provide enough adrenaline to satisfy even the most hard core action junkie.   The film also presents some maddeningly complex philosophical quandaries that are more directly presented as a part of the plot than the subtle underpinnings of the original Matrix.  This is probably another reason some people voiced some disdain about the movie: &quot;you mean I have to THINK about my entertainment and not just absorb mindless action?!?&quot; ;-)<br />In short, although the Wachowskis may not have hit a home run with Reloaded as they did with Matrix, they have certainly legged out a standing triple that entertains on multiple levels.

0385504209|1.0|It's shameful that Dan Brown, his editors and Doubleday have marketed _The Da Vinci Code_ as an \\"intelligent\\" mystery novel, \\"layered with remarkable research and detail.\\"  The writing is astonishingly lazy.  The proliferation of chapters is a cheap attempt to cover up the fact that the author isn't able to create a viable structure for the book, interweave elements of a plot or create complex characters. The sentence structure is poor throughout, and the figurative language is utterly inane. The research informing the book is pretty much what one expects from students in a freshmen creative writing class (at a mediocre school).  Skip Brown's pseudo-intellectual posturing and read Umberto Eco instead.
6302891272|5.0|I am a student in my 14th year at Nagoya International School.  To conclude the study of Macbeth, we watched four film versions of the play:  Polanski, Royal Shakespeare, English Shakespeare Company, and Kurosawa's Throne of Blood.  Of all these Kurosawa's movie, \\"Throne of Blood\\" had the most impact.  Although the film was in black and white and it didn't send me to sleep but provided me with lots of excitement.  This is significant because even in the world filled with color, a boy living in the 21st century still felt excitement while watching a black and white movie.  We could feel and see the tragedy that occurred at the castle where Lord Tsuzuki was murdered.  Kurosawa used his brilliant camera techniques to show the room smeared with blood.  Kurosawa also effectively created an eerie atmosphere as the fog and the mist rolled in and out of the scenes.  The story also made a successful transition from Scotland to Feudal Japan and it worked so well that the movie has a place alongside the other version of Macbeth.  I fully recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch Macbeth from another perspective.  SUGOI!!
B00006GFAB|5.0|&quot;The Very Best Of KISS&quot; is exactly what the title says.  With hits like &quot;Lick It Up&quot;, &quot;Forever&quot;, &quot;Beth&quot;, and &quot;Calling Dr. Love&quot; this is a necessity for any music collection.  Of course &quot;New York Groove&quot; from the album 'Ace Frehely' is another gem on this collection.  With all 21 terrific songs on this cd it is easy to see why any KISS fan would want to add it to their music collection.
B00006IUL7|4.0|An ace detective is after a killer, but his incredible sleeplessness (because it's always daytime in far northern Alaska) causes him to make more and more mistakes. Also his righteous indignation towards the quilty is clouded by his own guilt in two other incidents, making him gradually realize that he's not much better than the man he's chasing. All the elements are presented to you at the beginning, but you never know for sure how they're going to get there until they do so. For a movie that lays it cards out on the table so soon this one packs quite a few surprises. You may say, more than once, \\"I didn't know THAT was going to happen\\".
B0000DZEA1|4.0|It's hard to leave the Middle-Earth that Peter Jackson has crafted for our eyes and ears. And that note of bittersweetness pervades Howard Shore's score for &quot;Return of the King.&quot; Like the film, the music clings to your mind, bringing with it sorrow, hope, or happiness -- depending on what is going on at that time.<br />A backdrop for the action of the film is &quot;Hope and Memory&quot; (which starts off with sprightly hobbit music and slowly changes into a stately riding tune), the eerie and melancholy &quot;Minas Tirith,&quot; the reverent &quot;Return of the King&quot; (augmented by Viggo Mortensen singing in Elvish, a highlight), the ethereal &quot;Anduril,&quot; and the creepy &quot;Shelob's Lair&quot; and &quot;Minas Morgul.&quot;<br />Annie Lennox's &quot;Into The West&quot; is a lovely song, and a fitting finale to the trilogy of closing songs that handle first hope, betrayal, and now peaceful loss and healing. (&quot;Across the sea/a pale moon rises/the ships have come/to carry you home&quot;) But an underappreciated highlight of the CD is Billy Boyd's &quot;Steward of Gondor.&quot; Boyd's beautiful clear singing and the haunting lyrics (&quot;Mist and shadow/Cloud and shape/Hope shall fail/All shall fade&quot;) make this unforgettable as it was in the film (in tone, somewhat reminiscent of old Celtic laments).<br />Some parts of this album, like the &quot;Two Towers&quot; soundtrack, are very reminiscent of the &quot;Fellowship&quot; soundtrack (especially the opening &quot;A Storm is Coming&quot;). But many of them are merely influenced by what has come before, and they have a slightly new twist to them -- such as the doomsday singing in the semi-aptly-named &quot;End of All Things.&quot; And as the action is taken to new levels, Shore moves further from the sounds of the first movie and into a whole new area.<br />There isn't a dud track on the entire album. The music in the &quot;Return of the King&quot; soundtrack is as sweeping and evocative as the movie that it's named after. Howard Shore has created a beautiful, haunting collection (along with both professional singers, and those who can both sing and act) that even those who haven't seen the movie can appreciate musically.tive as the movie that it's named after.

B0000019PA|5.0|For some reason, I like a challenge when it comes to my records.  I want a CD that in order to enjoy, I have to listen to it nearly twenty times...  My mom says that's a sign of bad music -- music that you have to get USED to in order to enjoy.  I say that it's a sign of experimentation and artistic-soundness gone right.  And that's exactly what you'll get with this record.  On the first listen, you will wonder what you just listened to...  But you'll be pulled back in.  Jeff's voice becomes comforting, and his simple guitar strumming starts to be caught in your head.  And while his lyrics don't seem to make sense at first, (and even, at times seem schizo at best...) after a while, you start to understand what he means...  And soon his whole world will open up to you and engulf you in.  Oh yeah -- and I'm pretty sure he does acid... He has to.
B0000508U6|5.0|to be brief but precise:<BR>-christ martin has a beautiful, mellow, soothing, and touching voice.  and combined with the beautiful and emotional lyrics and musical compositions, this music is the kind that can make a person cry.<BR>-the album is all-around delicious.  each track is awesome.<BR>-this album is good ambience music for chilling out, relaxing, having a romantic dinner, doing other romantic things, or just the kind where you strap on your earphones, hold them close to your head, and sit back and absorb and enjoy the music (and i often end up doing just that with this cd).<BR>-this is one of my most precious albums.  my favorite tracks are &quot;shiver&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;trouble&quot;, the brief interlude which leaves you drooling and hanging for continuation--&quot;parachutes&quot;, and &quot;don't panic&quot;.  and it's hard to narrow it down, because it is just a delight to hear.  I also enjoyed the second album, as it was good to hear some upbeat and faster tunes from them, but PARACHUTES remains my favorite Coldplay album.
1892005034|5.0|Initially I thought this book wouldn't be relevant to me since I didn't consider myself a &quot;violent&quot; communicator. A few pages into the book however, it became evident to me that despite my easy-going nature, I had much to learn about communication. Dr. Rosenberg identifies learned communication that disconnects us from each other and is at the very root of violence. He then offers a simple yet powerful 4 step model that leads to respectful and compassionate communication. One catch - while the model is simple, it can be challenging to apply, especially when we're upset. That's because most of us have learned to blame others when we're upset and it's hard to unlearn this behavior. However, use of the model deepens our awareness and it becomes very clear how destructive our habitual knee-jerk reactions are to both ourselves and others. The Nonviolent Communication model helps us to become conscious and choose to respond differently - that is in ways that are more likely to lead to positive and satisfying outcomes for everyone. If you'd like to transform your relationships, for example: learn how to really listen to others while not taking anything you hear personally (what a gift!), learn how to give and receive in ways that are deeply gratifying, and much more, this is a must read. Also, this model is applicable in all relationship types - perfect for couples, parents, teachers, managers, executives, counselors and anyone else interested in relationship building. <br />On a personal note, this book has been life-changing for me. I have witnessed truly amazing results in all my relationships including one relationship which had been a great struggle for me for many years.
0380789035|4.0|I can see that many reviewers seem to think this effort by Neil Gaiman is somewhat of a disaster. The criticisms range from a thin plot, even thinner characters and that the story seemed to go nowhere (aha! a clue?). IMHO one of the main reasons for such criticism is because Mr Gaiman is more well known for his comic book stories than his novels. Perhaps for the reader of this book who is a fan of Gaiman's comics, the story would have been better told through a graphic novel. On the other hand, perhaps Gaiman's comics writing style was a little too evident in the book. For me, I think the book should be translated into a graphic novel (notice how I avoid the word comic) which would be great. I think one of Gaiman's strengths which shows up in the book is his graphic style of telling a story. When reading the book I could mentally picture the scenes being drawn. And this should be a positive aspect of the book - how many novelists are able to so evoke such imagery from simple words?<br />As for the thin plot and thinner characters...well, to each their own I guess. But I did not find the plot thin. Instead, I felt that it was a pretty good examination of several cultures and their respective beliefs which have come to the US and taken root there. Not being an American, I found it interesting to read that the US has at some time or other been the host of such diverse cultures - although the suggestion that ancient Egyptians established a colony in Florida could be where the fiction part of the novel comes into play.<br />As for the characters...well the Odin character was definitely interesting. An old man with many (non-magical) tricks up his sleeve...to raise cash. Shadow, the main character, on the other hand, does come across as rather confused. But this should not mean that the reader (and reviewers) should confuse his confusion for poor characterization. Shadow is a man just out of prison, who meets a tricky old man who shows him some really strange tricks along the way...and to top it all, Shadow's dead wife is coming along the journey in full physical form. Yes, I guess this makes it a &quot;road story&quot; but so what. I like to think of the journey is the interesting part and the end, if there is an end at all, is something which really isn't important at all.<br />Once again, good story; open your mind as you read it and you might like it. On the other hand, if you don't like the direction its taking after the first few chapters, then the option to stop reading is always there.the way...and to top it all, Shadow's dead wife is coming along the journey in full physical form.

B000092ZYX|5.0|When I bought this cd, I had no idea what it was going to sound like. I had perpously not listened to any on the songs before I bought it, and when the video for There there came on, I muted the sound and just watched the video. So when the cd finally came out, I couldn't wait to hear what was in store for Radiohead. When 2+2=5 first started, I heard the sounds of something which started out like a labtop, (only to find out later it was Jonny plugging in his guitar on the first day of recording), and I thought it would be a computer-generated song like on their earlier masterpieces Kid A and Amnesic. Then the guitar started and I thought Whoa! This took me off guard. Then after Thom finished singing Because... and started with You are not paying attention, it felt like OK Computer. The whole song just completely reversed all that I had thought this record would be. And throughout the whole record, it just kept amazing me song after song. However, The song that completely threw me off my feet was Sail to the Moon. I think that is one of the best songs Radiohead has ever done. The way the guitar overlaps the piano is beautiful. And Thom's voice is great as usual, but in this song he sings with a certain feeling he hasn't sung with since (Ok Computer's best song and Radiohead's best song) Let Down. And after seeing them live in Cleveland, Ohio, Radiohead proved that with this record, and their live show, they are the best band in the world, if not the best band of all time.<br />2+2=5 5/5 Bringing back the guitar<br />Sit Down. Stand Up. 5/5 THE RAIN DROPS<br />Sail to the Moon 5/5 Best since Let Down<br />Backdrifts 4/5 No Creep fans, Radiohead haven't completly given up their techno and electronica sounds<br />Go to Sleep 5/5 Another song that brings the guitar back to the front.<br />Where I End and You Begin 5/5 Good bass line, good lyrics<br />We suck Young Blood 5/5 Another great piano song, with a great voice<br />The Gloaming 3/5 weird song, but good<br />Therethere 5/5 not my choice for first single, but great nontheless. Good chorus<br />I will 5/5 Great song thats very short, one of my favorites on the cd<br />A Punchup at a Wedding 5/5 This would be my choice for the first single, great chorus, good bass line<br />Myxomatosis 5/5 Oh My God what is this? One of the weirdest songs ever written that is awesome. When the fuzz stops and Thom is left singing, I. Don't. Know. Why I. Feel. So. Toungue. Tied, that is brilliant.<br />Scatterbrain 5/5 Radiohead's pop song. Nice guitar<br />A Wolf at the Door 5/5 Some f*** ed up lyrics and psycho chorus.
B000002NHN|5.0|...then she MUST be good. Never in my life have i come across anything even remotely as powerful, meaningful, and beautiful as Loreena's voice, music, and brilliant lyrics.<BR>   There is not ONE song on this great album that i dislike... it brings the taste of the world right into my home - and i love the switch from a mystical, dance track like &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot; to a soft, sad ballad like &quot;Skellig&quot; and such...<BR>   I agree with other reviers, Loreena deserves much much more credit than what she has now, but I guess that's the beauty of it, for it shows that she creates music to touch and inspire instead of for the fame and publicity. ***** 5 STARS!!!!

B0000DD7NL|5.0|If you like R&amp;B, then Alicia Keys' 2nd CD - The Diary of Alicia Keys - is definitely for you.  This is a fantastic sophomore effort.  The smooth vocals on hip-hop beats is great.  Her songs really inspire you, and there is at least one song that somebody can relate to.  A great turn from her 1st CD, which was also great.
B0000DZ3EA|3.0|I love Peter Gabriel and this is a fair survey of his magnificent career even if, as other reviewers have noted, it neglects his second album.  (This isn't the case in all countries, so check Amazon for the import versions.)  The problem with \\"Hit\\" is that Gabriel enthusiasts will already have most of these songs, and the rest aren't really worth having.  \\"Burn You Up, Burn You Down\\" is the one exception - it's a solid track.  (Why it wasn't included as the promotional single on \\"Up\\" rather than the jarringly inappropriate \\"The Barry Williams Show\\" is beyond me.)  Half of \\"Up\\" is here, but in almost unrecognisable form.  The remixes of \\"Growing Up\\" and \\"More Than This\\" show what happens when subtle, interesting and luxuriously long tracks are tortured into the shape of radio fodder.  The twists on \\"OVO\\" are almost embarrassing - \\"Downside Up (Live)\\" isn't a patch on the original which had Elizabeth Fraser and Paul Buchanan on vocals (who can outsing Peter and family any day), and the remix of \\"The Tower That Ate People\\" takes a powerful rock track and dilutes it into a buzzing mess that would clear the dance floor it presumably aims to fill.  The reworking of \\"I Have The Touch\\" is more subtle and represents a nice updating of the arrangement.  Still, I'm puzzled why this collection has even been released.  It's heavily skewed towards Gabriel's later albums, so perhaps it's trying to generate interest in his more recent work which, let's face it, is wonderful but didn't sell as well as \\"So\\".  Fair enough.  It's a nice marketing ploy.  But if, like me, you bought and love \\"Us\\" and \\"Up\\" and everything before them, my advice is to grab the single of \\"Burn You Up, Burn You Down\\" and save your money for Peter's next album.
B00005JMTQ|5.0|A superb movie about advancing maturity. Yes, Nicholson might overdo a bit the famed sardonic smile and look, and the old curmudgeon/escapist tricks, but al ot more intelligence in this movie than the comedic aspects let you grasp at first. And superior acting. Both Keaton and Nicholson still have it (by the way, Keaton sure wears her high-class outfits well, and still has the charm and the \\"it\\" (the 'je ne sais quoi').  Not for the  and sorority bunch, the blow-them-up-and nuke-em crowds, or those born in the 70s or later. Watch out for Oscars. Don't miss this gem!!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|While I still think Scenes From a Memory is their best work, this album is also top notch. The compositional quality of the songs is good (I think they've really improved a lot in this regard since Jordan Rudess joined the band). The solo melodies are excellent. Mr. Rudess' keyboard solos are much more interesting than they have been in the past. And John Petrucci's writing and playing continue to amaze me.<br />Now, if only DT would release an all-instrumental CD.... :-)
0679457607|3.0|Hm. I must be a bit more skeptical than the others who have reviewed this book. What I'd like to know is if any of them found LASTING improvement to their golf games by following Gallwey's tips. For example, using the &quot;Back-Hit&quot; mantra may serve to clear your mind during the golf swing initially; but will it really transform your game in a permanent way?<BR>Again, the book is interesting and worth reading if you're looking for a non-traditional way to lower your golf score. I just wonder about the long-term benefits, that's all.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I thought the days of truly good voices were dead and buried for years now.  Thank goodness - I was wrong! There is a beautiful voice out there.  There are very few albums and artists that I can listen to over and over again without becoming bored because all their songs sound alike.  Not this one!  I put this on repeat and let it rip!  This album is for those who do appreciate an exquisite voice.  I believe that this young man has not been fully recognized yet for the talent he is.  He has a voice far beyond other male singers in today's market.  He can actually carry a tune (unlike others) and he reaches the notes without straining his vocal cords or screaming to get there.  His breathing technique seems perfect - you never hear him take a breath - it is seamless.  These love songs could melt the ice at the North Pole.  If you're not bilingual, it doesn't matter, the songs in Italian, Spanish and French are equally beautiful.  I hope that more people will treat themselves to this album and broaden their musical horizons.  I don't think you'll be disappointed- voices  like this don't come along everyday.
0316096199|4.0|I've been thinking about writing Alice Seabold.  Mainly because the ending to her book and the ending to mine is a bit similar.  My book is about living with veterans of WWII - actually being a &quot;veteran&quot; of living with veterans - and also ending up with Post Traumatic Shock Syndrome...  My book is called &quot;Eating Corn Through a Picket Fence&quot; and I hopes she reads it - and this too!!
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Lenny Kravitz to me is the latter Jimi Hendrix. His looks his vibe, his guitar playing all can be similiar to Jimi Hendrix. The music category would be hard to put this one on I would say classic rock or hard rock. Lenny Kravitz is defentily a great guitarist. I am a huge Jimi Hendrix classic rock fan and when I borrowed this cd off of my friend I was blown away. Are you gonna my way has a kick ass riff in it u can here his flying v cracked up in his marshall stack it just rocks!!Its a true rock melody. I also like the vibe of fly away the music is great. Some other songs I love on this CD are Mr.Cab Driver, and Rock N Roll Is Dead. If your a first time listener to classic rock or a guitarist buy this. This covers everything Lenny Kravitz the only negative statement I have to say about this CD is they did not include Dig In but this CD was released before Lenny wrote the song the rest of it is pure rock n roll. So I think I have anwsered all your questions enjoy!

0385504209|3.0|I have been really excited to read all the &quot;religious thrillers&quot; and looked forward to the DaVinci Code but found it slow moving and tedious.  I just didn't care about the characters.  If you liked it and even if you didn't like I bet readers would enjoy &quot;Sacred Ashes&quot; which is also available on Amazon.com.  It was fast-paced and should be read by all who seek twist and turns in a spiritual setting.  That said, Dan Brown should be commended for getting everyone talking about a subject that is at the heart of humanity.

PLEASE don't listen to the negative reviewers because...they obviously cared somewhat about the album to have even bought it...it debuted #1 with over 600,000 copies moved in that first week alone which is WAY WAY above average in todays &quot;downloading&quot; society! People love Britney they just don't want to admitt it...oh well...I don't care what folks think of me because Britney is a kick a** performer and a great entertainer period! Alot complain about her voice not being strong...uhhhhh....WHO CARES! It's a voice, it may not be strong like Christina's, but it it sounds good for the type of music that she is singing! In The Zone rocks....THATS ALL YOU NEED...STOP READING THIS...GO BUY IT NOW!!!
B0000C1733|3.0|I'm really not quite sure which approach the Chili Peppers are trying to take with this collaboration.  If the album is a collection of their greatest hits, meaning their most well-known and most played singles, then it should have included singles like \\"Aeroplane\\", \\"The Zephyr Song\\", \\"Around the World\\", and \\"Can't Stop\\".  If they were truly going for their best music, then they still didn't get it right; they included no songs from their 80's albums besides \\"Higher Ground,\\" and the album doesn't do a good job of showcasing the brilliant work that is Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  John Frusciante may be the Chili Pepper's best guitarist by far, but that doesn't mean that every single song they record with him is a masterpiece.  As close to true as that is, you wouldn't know it by hearing songs like \\"Suck My Kiss\\" or \\"Road Trippin'\\" over fan faves like \\"Sir Psycho Sexy,\\" or \\"Pretty Little Ditty.\\"  If you like what you hear on the radio, dive in.

0060922583|5.0|.<BR>I usually can determine a good book from the way it remains in the memory after subsequent time passes. In this case, almost a year later and I'm still thinking about Talbot's book.<br />Some notes I have made regarding wonderful points raised by Talbot.<br />1. The Mind fills in the physical holes in the eye's retina: completing eyesight with what the MIND perceives (not the eye sees) it to be; as opposed to naked reality.<br />2. Schizophrenia; the possibility of different souls, different persons, living in one body, as each personality contains entirely different electrical brain impulses, opposing patterns, and physiological variations, conflicting allergies, negative and positive physical traits that cannot be found in one individual.<br />3. Energy patterns leave traceable fingerprints in the holographic universe, traumatic events leave stronger residual patterns. An individual's energy pattern, angle and strength, may align itself with the remaining pattern of a previous event, thus illuminating and/or creating the observation of a ghost, an apparition of past events, places and peoples.<br />4. Repressed energy can result in the manifestation of poltergeist activity, appearing to be from external sources.<br />5. Advanced meditation results in equality and replacement to entheogenic drug use in mystical experiential consciousness. The example of Ram Dass (Richard Albert) encounter with an Indian Mystic more capable of mystical experience than the strongest dosage of hallucinogenic.<br />6. Non locality: the aspect of all reality, projected into the illusion of time and space, of separations.<br />7. Thought Bursts; this is an amazing idea. While all information is conveyed point-to-point, in thought bursts one obtains groups of thoughts at once time, that is increased levels of awareness. The result; head rushes, or revelations, inspirations. It is suggested that death experiences of entire lifetimes passing in a matter of a split second are of this nature.<br />This book has much more to relate. Five stars on my part.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Someone emailed me a E-Card previewing Whitney's One Wish CD.  I thought to myself, Whitneys doing a Christmas Album how nice. While out shopping one day I noticed it and picked it up.  I was skeptical about what i was going to hear when I put it in, but I WAS BLOWN AWAY.  Everything from the production to her magnificent vocals is well put together.  She sound so wonderful singing such joyous songs, and you can tell she really had her heart into it.  She even does a little duet with her daugther Bobby Kristina, which is cute.  IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS CD YET, GO OUT AND GET IT, IT WILL DEFINITELY BE A CHRISTMAS CLASSIC FOR YEARS TO COME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0156027321|3.0|\\"The Life of Pi\\" is 3/4ths good, and it must be that 3/4ths that has people so excited.  The story is well outlined above.  Pi is trapped at sea in a lifeboat filled with a number of animals, some of whom are devoured by the largest of them all, a Bengal Tiger.  Journey and conclusion unfold with no haste.  The book is a delight, though sometimes a gory one, until the author, and his characters, hit the doldrums, at which point I experienced the doldrums as well.  If the author's point is to let us feel the near unbearable passage of time adrift at sea, he does so, but at the expense of the entire story.<br />With that I have to cast another minority vote as to the overall worth of \\"The Life of Pi,\\" and assign three stars at best.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|People are saying this is the best sci-fi in a long time. I disagree. Star Trek doesn't hold a candle to this. This is the best ever. Maybe the original Star Wars movies rival it, but it's a close call. The space western theme is genius and makes perfect sense. As Trek so aptly put it and then failed to demonstrate, space is a frontier, much like the American old west. People are creating new settlements. Those that brave this frontier are those poor or oppressed looking for better opportunities, those seeking adventure, and generally anyone disaffected with the rest of civilization. Communication back to civilization is slow given the distance. People tend to move into new areas faster than the law can establish it's presence and people are forced to defend themselves against bandits and savages.<br />There are so many details that make a true sci-fi fan drool. There's the strict, no sound in space policy, The genius use of language oddities that are perfectly understandable but different enough from current speech patterns to convey the feeling that this is a different time period. There are none of standard sci-fi crutches like pulling new tech out of no where to cover over a plot hole and then conveniently losing it the next episode when that same tech could solve the plot in the first five minutes. The characters survive on their wits, not their tech. All these things work together to make this the best sci-fi show of all time.
0385504209|5.0|If your faith is easily threatened then don't read this book. It questions common religious beliefs but makes the Catholic church out to be a business or governmental organization, which it is. The adventure part of the story was interesting and kept me reading and the historical analysis made me curious about the topics even after finishing the book.
B00005JM02|5.0|Walt Disney Studios created what is probably one of their best animated films ever with the 2003 &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;.  With an all-star cast providing the voices, the film was written and directed by Andrew Stanton and co-directed by Lee Unkrich.  Andrew Stanton has written many popular animated films in the past few years including the 2001 &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, the 1999 &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, the 1998 &quot;A Bug's Life&quot; and the 1995 &quot;Toy Story&quot;.<br />&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is about a clownfish named Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould), who live in a sea anemone along the Great Barrier Reef.  Following the unfortunate demise of Marlin's wife Coral (voice of Elizabeth Perkins), Marlin becomes very protective of Nemo and doesn't want him to venture from their home.  Marlin relents, but Nemo is captured by a scuba diver and taken back to Sydney where he is put into a fish tank.  Determined to rescue his son, Marlin ventures out into open water and comes across an absent-minded blue tang named Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres) who joins Marlin in his search.  Nemo gets to meet some interesting characters in the fish tank including an angelfish named Gill (voice done by Willem Dafoe), a puffer fish named Bloat (voice of Brad Garrett), the confused fish Deb (voice of Vicki Lewis), a cleaner shrimp named Jacques (voice of Joe Ranft), a bubble-obsessed fish named Bubbles (voice of Stephen Root), a starfish named Peach (voice of Allison Janney) and Gurgles (voice of Austin Pendleton).  Other interesting characters include the pelican named Nigel (voice of Geoffrey Rush), the shark named Bruce (voice of Barry Humphries), the hammer-headed shark named Anchor (voice of Eric Bana), a sea turtle named Crush (voice of Andrew Stanton), the stingray schoolteacher named Mr. Ray (voice of Bob Peterson), the dentist (voice of Bill Hunter) and his frightening daughter Darla (voice of Jordan Ranft).<br />Of the variousendearing characters in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, my personal favorite is the absent-minded Dory.  Ellen DeGeneres did a superb acting job with her voice.  Willem Dafoe was also wonderful, as was Albert Brooks.  The quality of the animation in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is among the best that I have ever seen.  In a documentary contained on the second disk, Andrew Stanton comments on how he had to tell his animators not to make the underwater scenes look too real.  I have no doubt that the film will be nominated for Best Animation during next year's Academy Awards.  I would also not be surprised if it received nominations in other categories.  Some of the most memorable animation in the film includes the sea anemone moving with the ocean currents, the divers, the jellyfish and the deep-sea anglerfish.<br />Overall, I rate &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It is sure to please both children and adults alike for years to come.  The nice thing about the 2-disk DVD set is that it contains both wide-screen and full-screen versions of the film.  The documentary material and other extra material on the two disks is very good, including the encyclopedia of the various underwater species used in the film.
B000002UAR|5.0|Before I begin this review, let me first say that Revolver is a great, great album.  One of the Beatles' best, without question.  Is it THE best record the Beatles put out?  No.  It's not even their second-best.  Again, this is just one man's opinion -- comparing Beatles albums is like comparing Picasso paintings.  All of them are touched by genius, and often imitated without much success.<br />I define a great album this way:  One song logically follows the next, and there really aren't any songs you automatically skip over.  That alone makes it tough for me to name Revolver as the Beatles' best album, because I automatically skip over Yellow Submarine.  Sorry.  And while Love You To is fine for what it is, it's no better or no worse than Within You Without You from Sgt. Pepper.<br />Finally, I don't get that feeling that I need to hear Good Day Sunshine the minute that She Said, She Said is finished.  I believe that Rubber Soul and Sgt. Pepper fill that bill just a fraction better than Revolver, which doesn't seem as unified as Sgt. Pepper.  For all its innovations and pop perfection, Revolver still sounds like a &quot;Beatles album&quot;, whereas Sgt. Pepper seems very different, and much more realized (though I do always skip over She's Leaving Home - too schmaltzy).<br />But this argument is classic \\"apples and oranges,\\" and those kinds of debates are fun.  It's bit like debating whether Mantle or Mays was the better centerfielder.  On its own, without the comparison to other albums, Revolver is easily one of the best albums of all time.  It's amazing to think of the risk the Beatles took with Revolver, considering that in 1966, most established pop groups were still very unwilling to go beyond the simple three-minute song format that addressed boy-girl puppy love themes -- and little else.  The experimental trend with music and lyrics was first popularized by Bob Dylan, and later expanded upon by groups such as the Beach Boys, the Beatles, and the Byrds.  By 1967, the door had been kicked wide open and it seemed as if every artist was innovating.  Revolver was a major part of that revolution.<br />To the fan who is truly discovering the Beatles and their music: your collection is grossly incomplete without this album.By 1967, the door had been kicked wide open and it seemed as if every artist was innovating.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|Well. I saw the movie, and i like it, is a good action film, lot of shooting, chasing, a hero, a girl in love of the hero and all the ingredients that make a good action film. But that's it, I can't talk about reloaded as a second part of the great MATRIX, why? The plot it's not consistent with all the ideas that where thrown over the first film, for example, at the end of THE MATRIX NEO was able to understand the matrix code and destroy the agents without fight them, he become omnipresent inside the system, but in RELOADED he was only a supercharged human with limited powers. Another inconsistency, at the end of reloaded, where NEO is capable of shutdown the sentinels just extending the hand, wasn't the matrix a computer environment where the hackers could jack in by plug themselves with a wire attached to their head? so NEO goes wireless? what happened with the interface that they need for entering the system? We have to remember that THE MATRIX is only a computer based system. I'm sorry but there is too much inaccuracy trying to join both films.  <BR>  The scene with the arquitect, where they want to explain everything in joust five minutes is boring pointless and meaningless, when I saw the movie at first time I get lost at the middle of it. Well this film got a lot of details that already where pointed out for another reviewers so I joust can said that RELOADED is a great film if it's looked apart of THE MATRIX.  if you wanted to find a connection, then you are not going to enjoy this film. Watch it and don't try to understand and tray to make it fit in the MATRIX Universe that were created around THE MATRIX first movie. I think The Wachousky brothers goes for the big bucks instead of the big movie.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is very good. As good as Parachutes, if not better.
0385504209|3.0|This book is a good read.  I read it in one sitting.  My main criticisms are: 1. The priory of sion is really a hoax. 2. It is too politically correct and contrived. 3. I did not really care about the secret of the Holy Grail.  4. I never cared about the characters.<br />The positives are: 1. Dan Brown teaches the reader a few interesting facts about some fascinating works of art. 2.  The first half of the book is a good murder mystery.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X2 was without a doubt the best sequel of 2003, and quite possibly for the past five years (as long as you don't count \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" movies which were all filmed at once).  And it falls into that exclusive club of actually being better than the previous film (a la \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", \\"Godfather 2\\", \\"Aliens\\", \\"Terminator 2\\", \\"The Two Towers\\"). Everything they could have done right with this movie was done.  With the premise and charater set up completed in the first movie, Director Singer as able to allow Jackman and the rest of the X-crew to jump into this movie full steam, without any slow down in pace. Supported by a solid story and excellent cast (including franchise newcomers Alan Cumming, Brian Cox, and Kelly Hu), this was definitely a \\"road picture\\" in the sense of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (the standard that all first sequels seem to be compared to), and there doesn't seem to be a moment wasted on screen.  Despite the enormous number of characters in the movie, whenever one of them take center(screen) they are given that moment to shine, from Nightcrawler's breathtaking opening scene, to cameo characters: Kitty Pryde, Syrin, and Colossus (who has THE coolest cut-away reaction shot in the whole movie). At the end you'll hardly believe that you just sat through a movie that was longer than two hours.  There has been critism that Kelly Hu was sorely underused in this movie (she does only have one line in the whole picture), but to give her more screen time, for the sake of screen time, would have come off as \\"filler\\", in an already full movie, which in its current form X2 was able to avoid.  It could be said that Cyclops was used even less than Hu's characters, until his sudden return late in the picture where the pay off is well worth it.<br />While this movie falls into the cliche of \\"sequels need to be bigger\\", it certainly has the story to support the bigger special effects, bigger action, and bigger sets.  At not one time does this movie fall into the \\"flash without substance\\" trap the way certain \\"Schumacher\\" directed \\"Bat\\" sequels, or a more recent \\"Full Throttle\\" romp, did with a vengeance.<br />And thankfully they gave X2 the \\"1.5\\" treatment the first time round (so there doesn't have to be a 2.5 version) without us having to shell out the extra coin for a second DVD.  And the extras are pretty much all you could ask for, without getting a \\"Director's Cut\\" of the film. From the theatrical trailers (which are still cool to watch even if you've already seen the film a few times), to in-depth behind-the-scenes documentaries on certain scenes, the film production in general, and well-deserved spotlights on Nightcrawler's character.  The extended \\"Wolverine/Lady Deathstrike\\" fight scene is a particular gem, (just to see the little bits that were trimmed away to give the movie its PG-13 rating) as is a gag-reel clip involving Jean Grey.<br />For the longest time, I rated the commentary on \\"The Matrix\\" as THE WORST I've ever listened to (that is until I tried to listen to the director's commentary on \\"Star Trek Nemesis\\", where the director literally knew jack about Star Trek), so it was so refreshing to get not only a Bryan Singer's commentary, which was full of insight and behind the scenes anecdotes, but to also get a second producer/writer commentary which was just as informative.  You can tell these filmmakers had fun and put a lot of passion and hard work into making this movie, which gives us hope that X3 will be just as good if and (more likely) when they make it.  Film students won't get the kind of learning infomation as they would from a Macheal Bay commentary, but they are well-worth the listen, and it doesn't hurt that you get to see all the cool action scenes while you listen.<br />Hey, how can you go wrong with a movie that has Captain Picard, Gandalf, Wolverine, a near-naked supermodel, and two Bond-girls?
B00005JMFR|5.0|Most people here seem to be dissapointed in this film for some reason or another (some people have complained about there being too many love scenes between Neo and Trinity, while others have simply whined about the peaceful ending).  Upon hearing these grievances prior to watching the film, I've become immune to its flaws (Ha ha!! I'm the only person I know who actually LIKES this film!!!!).<br />The characters are as well portrayed as before, if not moreso.  It's interesting to see how the machine programs have become more human.  But there's no further development on them.<br />The story itself is what really matters for the film.  It doesn't have as much action as \\"Reloaded,\\" but the battle of Zion is definately worth seeing.  It's a twenty-minute extravaganza of flying machines, pummels crashing through everything, APUs marching around, and missiles flying everywhere.  Directly afterwards is Neo and Trinity's desparate flight to Machine City, and Neo's battle with Agent Smith, where the directors utilize their awesome cinematography skills for the climax.<br />I do have to say that the climax of the film is not what I've been expecting.  From the beginning, I always got the impression that Neo would destroy the machines from their source.  Ultimately, however, the ending that \\"Revolutions\\" has is more logical.  The conflicts are resolved in a way that allows mankind to make a choice for itself.  It's as if the equasions of the film are balancing themselves out.<br />The final scene makes the inference that Neo may return.  I doubt that a fourth Matrix film will ensue, but I'm thinking that they'll produce a Matrix TV show, thus allowing the franchise to reach every venue of media.<br />With an open mind and without reservations, this final chapter of the Matrix trilogy may be enjoyable, particuarly for fans.  But the final verdict is up to you if and when you choose see it.
B00006BCAZ|5.0|_Metanoia_ is essential if you like this kind of thing. This is a proto-_Signify_ recording (from the same sessions), which has Porcupine Tree experimenting in the studio with spacey jams to flesh out their ideas and sonics. It might be different from what most Porcupine Tree fans are used to, especially if they are primarily familiar with their more recent song-based material.<br />_Metanoia_ may be outtakes, but personally I think these improvs are very successful and compelling. Spacey guitars and synths, Colin Edwin's hypnotic fretless basslines, and Chris Maitland nuance-filled, tricky drumming are merged into a Floydian soup of aural delight. Also remarkable is the band's emphatic mindset towards creating -- it's all improvised, after all. The songs are long and gaseous, only occasionally suggesting forward movement, but intuitively developing tension or dynamics or atmosphere with great expertise. Sometimes if an album like this goes on for 60 minutes, it can be tiresome. However, Porcupine Tree keeps it from dragging or putting you to sleep, simply because the sonic rapture of this set is so absorbing. Some of the most sublime PT moments are found here, minus the final track &quot;Milan&quot; which is just two minutes of people talking about frivolous things (I'm not sure why it's there, and the album would be better without it).<br />It's very easy to lay back in the dark with headphones and become lost in this expansive, lush document. And Edwin's bass is soooo mesmerizing. Some people would have no interest in this kind of thing, but I think it is a highly valuable part of my PT collection. It works as a chemical-free way to trip out or as cosmic lovemaking music for astronauts.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Hey yo,Its a live audience Recorded Music CD.It's  suppose,not  to be perfect.Cause in a studio record THEY ALWAYS  FIXED PROBLEMS and the musicians repeat it until it's  well done.So please don't complain about  the  crowd and  minor  bugs.The  CD  its  great and  the  BAND  still KICK A.....
B0000DFZZC|5.0|This movie is proof that Hollywood IS capable of putting out a quality product. All the elements come together on this one-rare indeed. Gets my vote for Picture Of The Year.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I've read a lot of reviews saying some of the songs were too long or boring. Not really; some songs are, undeniably, long, but by no means boring. \\"Wholle Lotta Love\\" is a especial treat, showcasing how good Zep really was. \\"Moby Dick\\" can become repetitive to the casual Zep fan, but a die hard (like me) will love it. \\"Dazed and Confused\\" (the longest song, reaching 25 minutes and 25 seconds) is absolutey great. At some points, Page's guitar sounds like a dragon's roar, masterfully blending in with the drums and bass. Another song that deserves mention is \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\", mainly because of Plant's harmonica work in the begining of the song. All in all a great album and a must for any rock fan.<br />PS: If you think the album's boring, than just go back to listening to Linkin Park, Korn or whatever crap you thrash your ears with.
B000088E6D|1.0|It's flat and dull and totally uninspiring, which is saying something when one considers the material he uses.  How can he NOT be inspired by these songs?  Does the man's heart not beat?<BR>Who cares, really? Do yourself and us all a favour, don't encourage him by buying this CD and instead look for Johnny Hartman and/or Sammy Davis Jr.  Your ears will thank you.
B00008J4P5|3.0|...but still better than the usual crap we get nowadays. It's somewhat recomforting to know that at least some groups are going back to the blues/metal of the 60s &amp; 70s (namely Led Zep). However, The White Stripes still have a lot of room to improve, namely on drums and guitar (their backbone I'd say). Nonetheless, give it a try, you might like it. But by no means try to compare Jack White to Robert Plant, please.
B0000028RR|4.0|Rage's first album is definitely a buy for rock fans.  Lets start off with the songs...<br />1.Bombtrack-A great song...great guitar and bass in this one, but the only thing is the &quot;Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn&quot;  gets a little repetitive but otherwise one of thier best.<br />2.Killing in the name-One of the first songs Ive heard from them, and one of my favorite.. Definitely a great live song for everyone to sing to.  Awesome lyrics with &quot;Some of those that were forces are the same that burn crosses&quot;.<br />3.Take the Power Back-Always loved this song, the guitar and bass again are awesome but its the lyrics that get me on this one.  So much talk about the public school system.  Its all the truth.  &quot;In the right light, study becomes insight But the system that dissed us Teaches us to read and write&quot;.<br />4.Settle for nothing-Slows it down a little here, but still Zack's screaming on this one is awesome.<br />5.Bullet in the head-Awesome song, the solo for Tom Morello is amazing.  Probably one of the best from him that I have ever heard.  The line &quot;Standin in line, believin the lies, ya bowin down to the flag, ya gotta bullet in your head.&quot;<br />6.Know your enemy-Great music in this song, not a big fan of the chorus but the lyrics are still good.<br />7.Wake up-This is one of the songs I have to say I skip over.  Good song but not catchy for me.<br />8.Fistfull of steel-Another skipper.<br />9.Township rebellion-I like the songs music.  Its an awesome beat but again not satisfied.<br />10.Freedom-Overall greatest Rage song ever..I would buy this album if it only HAD THIS song on it.  Freedom has one of the greatest guitar riffs.  Also the words are awesome.  Live this song is at its best.<br />Overall...buy the album, I give it a 4 out of 5 only because of the last three songs before freedom.  But seriously if you are into Rock get this cd.
0553208845|5.0|For a story written in 1922, Hermann Hesse captures the feel of ancient India with an apparent ease and enthusiasm. Siddhartha is a story of a man and his search for enlightenment. As a young boy, Siddhartha decides to denounce his family's wealth and luxuries in an effort to gain wisdom. When his adventure starts he is accompanied by his friend, Govinda, and he is equipped with the knowledge of many teachers and the experience of being a Brahmin's son. Many years pass in which Siddhartha learns the values of thinking, fasting, and waiting. Only through the hardest of times Siddhartha is able to gain wisdom, only through mistakes Siddhartha is able to reach his destination.<br />Hermann Hesse uses great imagery and imagination in his creation of a story that has excellent symbolism and philosophic value. This historic-fiction novel displays an undeniable look at life while creating a mood that will keep the reader interested, entertained, and turning the pages. Recommended for intrinsic thinkers of any age.
B00009V7P8|4.0|Damien Rice plays an acoustic guitar backed by a chello in most of the songs and I must say its awesome.  I am a rock fan.  But after hearing this cd I couldnt put it down.

Towards the end he starts to yell the words and it is amazing.<br />2.Volcano-We get introduced to the woman singing on the album as well.  Together they sound amazing and I really love the 4 part harmony at the end.  They do it with two voices.<br />3.The Blowers daughter-Awesome Love song.

B00005YTFG|5.0|The Bohemian Paris of the beginning of the 20th century has always fascinated people. This film is an attempt to capture this Paris of Toulouse Lautrec and his friends, of Montmartre and the Moulin Rouge that is becoming the trendiest theater of the country and probably of Europe. So this musical is absolutely full of music and singing and dancing and all other type of stage art to transform everyday life into a constant whirlwind of immediate action that is supposed to swallow up feelings, sentiments, passions, and all other derangements of the mercantile mind of these artists who must only try to trap the rich with their women who become nothing but whores, prostitutes and money grabbers. This film could have been sordid and bleak. But it is luminous and brilliant because the show on the stage is entirely mixed up with the reality of a love affair between a poet and one of these courtesans that embellish the stage with desire, passion and life for the impulses of the rich male audience. Hence the poor Satine is at first divided between a rich Duke she has to seduce to get money for the theater and a young poet who is so inspired that he makes her vibrate with love, a sentiment she did not know so far. From divided she moves to torn apart and from torn apart she moves to subjugated and mesmerized. Love has become the new absinth of this relation, an alcohol that leads her beyond all possible reason. Yet she will betray it to make the show possible, and yet her love will re-enter the stage through a small window under the stage after having been expelled through the main entrance door. And the show becomes real life, the plot becomes real passion, and what's more tuberculosis catches up on Satine and makes her die in the closing scene of the play transforming a simple dramatic act into a real life event, without the audience realizing the drama. This film is thus breath-taking by its rhythm and by the merging together of reality and illusion. It becomes a dream made true by some fairy in the wings. Yet it avoids pure sentimentalism and reaches the beauty of the mind and the heart. It is greater than God's intervention in human affairs. It is no « deus ex machina » but it is the real power of real life invested in the artificial brilliance and elegance of a theatrical show. Romantic maybe, sentimentalese never. A masterpiece of Bohemian art one century after the events.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUtrue by some fairy in the wings.

B00012QM86|5.0|It's about time they made this movie into DVD. I was hoping to see this movie in DVD because of the bonus material. It is a beautiful film, sad, (it makes me cry everytime I see it) but reminds me that even in the mist of evil there is goodness within people. <br />I love Liam Neeson in this movie. He is a great actor but this role is his best. There's also other great actors like Ben Kingsley. Spielberg is a genius and I don't have to say he has other great films, but this is his absolute masterpiece. Great cinematography, and the black and white effect is fenomenal. John Williams, my favorite composer made beautiful and hartfelt music.<br />I have seen other holocaust movies and they don't compare to this one. I agree that the actual holocaust is much worse than this, and it's needless to say that we shouldn't call a great movie that shows such atrocities, but this movie, rather than just showing the crude truth, it's there, we know, and we feel the pain somehow, but it also shows the greatness of people that endured to survive (all Holocaust survivors), and that people such as Oskar Schindler (like so many others of his time) that didn't have to worry about a thing (they were protected by money and powerful allies), turned his life around to help others, and this was a matter of life and death.<br />This movie has to be in my DVD collection! Anyone that has not seen this movie, it's just Hollywood at it's finest!
B00008PW2D|2.0|I have this season on VHS, taped off HBO when it aired.  That may very well be where it will stay unless I find this cheaper.  This season had some good moments such as, the trip to CA and the meeting with Big, the conversion to Judaism, and the baby, but the price is outrageous compared to what you're getting in the other seasons.  Yes, price is also what we are reviewing.  Not just content. Maybe if they had added some 'behind the scenes' or outtakes or something like that, maybe it would be more enticing, but there doesn't seem to be any such thing on this DVD. <BR>If this show doesn't end the way everyone is hoping and expecting, season 6 may also be a dud.
B000002UA7|5.0|With five albums under her belt from EMI Records, it was time for Kate to put out a greatest hits.  She'd made it big with Hounds Of Love, which spawned four hit singles, and The Whole Story brings her EMI songs to closure.  And it was this album that introduced me to Kate Bush, and the rest is history.  Key, []=original studio album.<br />The version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; features a newer vocal, which is more developed than the girlish vocals of the Kick Inside days and helps the piano and drums of this song.  Yes, she does sing about the longing about Kathy towards Heathcliff.  Much better than the original.<br />&quot;Cloudbusting&quot; is my favorite single from here, especially with its martial rhythm set by the strings and synthesizers.  The song and the video are related, as it's sung from the POV of the daughter of an inventor who creates a rainmaking machine that gets the government after the inventor, considered a threat to the men in power.  [Hounds Of Love]<br />&quot;Breathing&quot; is one of Kate's most serious pieces, about the effects that radioactive fallout has on a baby still in the womb, and it's sung from the perspective of the infant.  The addition of a cold official sounding voice reporting the results of fallout from a nuclear test and the crescendo that rises with the &quot;What are we going to do, we are all going to die refrain&quot; shows that Kate is an artist with political conscience. [Never For Ever]<br />One of Kate's best realized pieces is the piano ballad &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot; on a man who is most surely her Prince Charming, [The Kick Inside]<br />The dreamy &quot;Wow&quot; about the travails of fame and show business [Lionheart] is followed by two songs from Hounds Of Love, the frantic title track, and &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, where she is ready to make a deal with God and trade places.  There's some weird background vocals towards the end.<br />The sombre guitar ballad &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; tells the story of a serviceman in the B.F.P.O. who's been killed and the opportunities he never had, such as a proper education, the ability to play a guitar, or getting married and having a child.  &quot;What a waste, army dreamers&quot; Kate laments.<br />The upbeat weirdness of &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; tells the story of someone who wants to be an intellectual, scholar, full of knowledge, but can't be bothered to learn and just wants it set in her lap, i.e. &quot;just gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme.&quot;<br />&quot;Experiment IV&quot; the new song, is about some people asked by the military to create a &quot;sound that could kill someone from a distance,&quot; instead of &quot;music made for pleasure, music made to flow.&quot;  And the regrets of the inventors for making such a weapon is felt in the lyrics.  The sound neatly fits in the Hounds Of Love era.<br />&quot;The Dreaming&quot; featuring a didgeridoo, and Kate's slight Australian twang, tells how the aborigines and the natural habitat are being exploited by the mining companies, with the aborigines being driven to drink and even kangaroos being hit by vehicles.  [The Dreaming]<br />Finally, &quot;Babooshka&quot; is about a woman who tests her husband's fidelity by writing him anonymous letters, disguising herself as a younger version of herself, and seeing if he'll go through with an adulterous affair with his own wife.  The piano is struck forcefully during the verses, before the electric guitar riffs kick in the prechorus and chorus.  [Never For Ever]<br />Kate's greatest hits does not tell the &quot;whole story&quot;, as she had two more albums and a record deal with Sony, but it tells the best stories of the recording chapters of her career, as they were the most experimentally creative and lyrically enriching.mers&quot; tells the story of a serviceman in the B.F.P.O. who's been killed and the opportunities he never had, such as a proper education, the ability to play a guitar, or getting married and having a child.  &quot;What a waste, army dreamers&quot; Kate laments.<br />The upbeat weirdness of &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; tells the story of someone who wants to be an intellectual, scholar, full of knowledge, but can't be bothered to learn and just wants it set in her lap, i.e. &quot;just gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme.&quot;<br />&quot;Experiment IV&quot; the new song, is about some people asked by the military to create a &quot;sound that could kill someone from a distance,&quot; instead of &quot;music made for pleasure, music made to flow.&quot;  And the regrets of the inventors for making such a weapon is felt in the lyrics.

B00004RITP|5.0|If you are among those who love Mahler's music, you will likely enjoy this very much.  This Deryck Cooke performing version of Mahler's Tenth has become pretty much the benchmark to which other verions are compared.<br />Simon Rattle's interpretation here seems flawless, so I can't imagine you could find a better performance of the Cooke version.<br />For those unfamiliar with Mahler's music, expect grandeur and drama.  Nearly all those epic films of the 50s and 60s had soundtracks written by composers taught by Mahler's followers or students--that's why Ben Hur, El Cid, and such sound so much bigger than life.  Mahler's music is to symphonies what opera is to songs:  it captures the bigger picture of life, on a grander scale.  If you're new to Mahler, listen for the pain and anguish of life, and also the beauty of love, and the peace of accepting the inevitability of death.  Sorry if that sounds a bit melodramatic, but that's what Mahler is--unafraid to confront, in music, the greatest mysteries and emotions of life.<br />Personally, I prefer the Remo Mazzetti performing version of Mahler's Tenth.  It's available on a recording by Leonard Slatkin conducting the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra.  Maybe it's just me, but that version sounds more true to Mahler's sound.  Yet, this Deryck Cooke version is also excellent, and it might be best to listen to both, and decide for yourself.<br />It's hard to please everyone, when trying to complete an \\"unfinished symphony,\\" but this (and the Mazzetti version) are excellent examples of cutting the Gordian Knot.
B00008MLSH|5.0|I am eagerly awaiting delivery of the CD but already have nothing but praise for this extraordinary artist. I had the great pleasure to hear her Lucia in Los Angeles last week and was completely floored! Hers is one of the most exceptional voices performing today. The online album samples show a pleasing grasp of Mozart. I agree with other reviewers who caught the easy darkness in her voice, and I look forward to one day hearing her exploit that. -- Jim Eshelman
0783231032|1.0|What a waste of talent. I don't even want to give this movie onestar. Surprised this bomb is still in print, it's truly a dawg. I picked it up in the library, I saw John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd, figured it would be good. Wrong.It is bad as it can get.  Spielberg tried to use slapstick. It's continiously not funny.To think of all the stunts and wrecks and all the money that wasted making this film, and there are people starving. I just could not wait until it would end, and it seemed like it would never end. Animal House, the blues brothers and even neighbors it is not. Don't waste your evening.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|This is an excellent movie. Firstly, I am a huge fan of the Daft Punk album &quot;Discovery&quot;, so I loved the music. The animation was suprising VERY good. I didn't really expect too much, but the story ended up being very well told (with no acutual dialogue within the film) and beautiful to look at. If you love Daft Punk buy this NOW. If you like anime, you should check it out too, as it's flawless.
0553278398|2.0|Maybe its because I'm not much of a fan of Asimov, but I was disappointed in this book.  Asimov's &quot;Foundation&quot; was OK 3.5/5 stars, but Prelude to Foundation was a very disappointing 2/5.  Why?  The plot is &quot;super extra simple&quot;, Hari Seldon has no dimension to him (he functions like a thinking robot more than a human), and not much happens in the book.  There are pages where Asimov's characters comment endlessly about how good the food is, but the commentary, while long, isn't even very descriptive so it turns out plain old boring.  You never get much of a sense of the danger Hari is in.  The only really fun part is when Hari gets stuck on the roof of Trantor and has to stay the night.  But that's short lived, and in the end, you wish he'd been left up there to die.  <br />The only real interesting parts to the book are Asimov's commentary on science.  His social commentaries, told through Hari Seldon are a total snorefest.  I'm really suprised so many people liked this book.  But I guess its because they are Asimov fans.  If you're new to Sci Fi, or an Asimov fan, you might like it.  If you're a sci fi veteran, you'll probably be disappointed like me.  <br />I would recommend instead, if you prefer a richer more complex and compelling Sci Fi tale, to pick up a copy of &quot;Nova&quot; by Samuel R. Delany, &quot;Dune&quot; by Frank Herbert, or &quot;Revelation Space&quot; by Alistair Reynolds - all three are excellent.<br />Now I'm off to the bookstore to give &quot;Hyperion&quot; by Dan Simmons a try.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a touching reading experience which inspires wonder.  The story is tough: a 14 year old girl is raped and murdered by a sleazy neighbor whom no one suspects.  Her mother, father, sister and brother are devastated and never recover from their loss.  Her schoolmates and neighbors are also significantly affected.  This is a story about grieving and loss.  It's also, and here's where wonder becomes tangible, a story about the life of the dead and their influence on the living.  The murdered girl, Susie Salmon, goes to heaven from where she follows her family and friends -- as well as her murderer who gets away with it -- and shares their emotional nightmare.  <br />What great characters are these people who have been part of Susie`s life and death.  I was fascinated by the trials and reactions of Susie's family.  Her weakened father, her belligerent and determined sister, her four year old brother and her maverick mother.  Eventually, Susie's mother leaves her family.  Alice Sebold depicts how this bereft mother cannot remain with her family and, at the same time, be able to cope with the loss of her oldest child.  Susie's schoolmate, whom she rushes past on swift passage to heaven through the faculty parking lot (\\"She was standing in my path when my soul shrieked out of Earth.\\"), becomes obsessed with Susie and eventually becomes the means by which Susie can finally leave the living and rest her soul.  <br />Although about death, The Lovely Bones is a celebration of life.  It reminded me of OUR TOWN but without a guiding stage manager to ease the painful heavenly experience and put it into perspective.  With Susie as our guide, the reader is made to feel as lost, bewildered and touched as these characters.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I was very impressed with this cd. 5 out of 5.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Perhaps the storyline of Peter Jackson's &quot;The Two Towers&quot; doesn't follow Tolkien's book as closely as some people would like, but I feel otherwise.  It's true that I miss certain characters, such as the Ent called Quickbeam, but to me, capturing the story of the Two Towers is not about showing every miniscule detail.  To be sure, some details are important, as shown in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; when Sam Gamgee claps Frodo's hand in Rivendell.  The most important thing, though, is to stay true to the themes that Tolkien wove into his work, and in that I think Mr. Jackson has done admirably.  And, of course, the information displayed in the appendices are a treasure to lovers of film-making, such as myself.  <br />Mr. Jackson, thank you for this amazing piece of cinematic art.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|While I truly love the music from all the Lord of the Rings films, this is the only one that I listened to before the film and was actually riveted, just by the music.  The other ones meant more to me mostly after I had seen the films, but with the Return of the King, I was captivating and enthralled from the start.  Boasting Billy Boyd's truly ethereal delivery of a passionate and haunting song, Aragorn's piece (with melody written by Viggo Mortensen himself!), awesome themes for The Pellenor Fields, Twilight and Shadow and The Grey Havens, and Annie Lennox's Oscar-bound &quot;Into the West,&quot; this soundtrack is a winner from start to finish.
B0000CFW87|4.0|Josh Groban has a great voice. The reason why I give this CD a four are for reasons that shouldn't discourage you from buying it, overall it is a good production. First most tracks are overproduced, this is tragic because a pure, strong and well-trained voice like Josh's does not need all the overarrangements and editing. Second is the emotional interpretation of most songs, I don't feel much more than the volume and vibrato in his voice. In my humble opinion Josh needs to feel it more to take the tracks to the next level. And last but not least is that I'm concerned about the direction he's going in, vocally that is. His technique is leaning more towards the pop side and I hear some unnecessary belting, please keep the classical pure technique, you'll last longer and sound better. Great job though! Congrats!
B00005JMF6|2.0|A stale-if-atmospheric psychothriller that doesn't even have the ambition to provide a red herring, \\"Gothika\\" could well prove to be the nightmare movie of Halle Berry's career: The Academy Award winner broke her arm during production; divorced her husband; the movie isn't any good; and neither is she in it. The American debut for French director Mathieu Kassovitz - he played the shy love interest in \\"Amelie\\" - \\"Gothika\\" is visually up-to-snuff (an intended pun that you'll understand if you see the movie) but loaded with the kind of boo material - ominous tattoos, torture, the stigmata - that lost its freshness the minute \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" hit theaters. You would have figured Ralph Fiennes punctuated the body art motif with his turn in \\"Red Dragon.\\" You figured wrong.<br /> Berry is Dr. Miranda Grey, a state hospital shrink attempting the break the wall of a patient - played by Penelope Cruz with something I'd like to call \\"endearing menace\\"- while Miranda's administrator husband (Charles S. Dutton) administrates and a colleague (Robert Downey, Jr.) fawns after her in that creepy, insinuating way only Downey can. The quick, dirty setup leads to a dark stormy night where the main road is flooded over and Miranda is forced to traverse a bridge in middle of a forest. She encounters a young girl and wakes up the next morning, a patient in her very own hospital, accused of murdering her husband. <br />Since \\"Gothika\\" never brings any other murder suspects into the picture, the movie explores not who killed the Dutton character, but why the girl \\"influenced\\" Miranda to do it. Let it be said that the filmmakers conjure up a thoroughly hateful, cruel explanation for the murder that argues not only that one bad deed deserves another, but that two bad deeds an entertaining movie makes. \\"Gothika\\" is no longer than 90 minutes, and yet it's too long by half; there is so little meat to Sebastian Guitierrez's screenplay that Downey's repeated interrogations, and Cruz's rueful whisperings, exist only to stretch the movie to official feature length.<br />Berry, who can be very good (\\"Monster's Ball,\\" \\"Losing Isaiah\\") or virtually transparent (the \\"X-Men\\" movies) plays Miranda as one long, freaked out, screaming mess - Berry's heart is in it, but her talent isn't. Cruz partakes in another bewildering, at-times-incomprehensible supporting role. Downey plays a good guy and makes him borderline insufferable. <br />And then there's Kassovitz, for whom I see a future as a director, even if the material is thin. He has horror tendencies - the prison of \\"Gothika\\" is murky, and the movie's \\"encounter\\" scene is handled well - mixed some basic clue of pacing; the movie drags, but not for Kassovitz's lack of effort.

I don't really know what to say, except that this is truely one of the most wonderful things that I have ever seen! I cannot wait for it to be released on DVD! In short, watch this movie, buy this movie, and most importantly, love this movie! It is far better than a mere 5 stars could ever even attempt to convey.
B000089QEN|1.0|I have never read this book, but bought it based on other movies I enjoyed that BBC has done.  If you like Charles Dickens, you might enjoy this, but if you are looking for anything lighthearted or romantic you will be disappointed.  Nothing like Pride and Prejudice or Wives and Daughters which I enjoyed very much.  Although I am sure that this is a literary masterpiece, it is depressing (as many literary masterpieces are).  This is not an all around bad movie, just a bad match for me.

B00008DDSC|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie, clearly too high.  As a fan of spanking in real life, watching this movie was painful, and not in a fun way.  The two characters in this story are so psychologically messed up that it removes any eroticism the teasers and trailers suggest.  This is one of those movies where the trailers were better than the movie.   <br /> The secretary Lee, played by Gyllenhaal, plays the part of the abused child very well, so well that I feel sorry for her and wish she would really get therapy.  <br /> James Spader, plays Edward, the lawyer who hires Lee, and he is a very odd lawyer indeed.  He only uses a typewriter, and loves red pens.  This would be perfect for us spanking fans, but he plays the role neurotic, not erotic.  I wish he would get some therapy as well!<br />This movie was a dud in my mind and if you think this would be a good spanking intro movie - DO NOT DO IT.  It's a better movie for people learning to be therapists than for spanking fans.  They could have made both characters less psychologically damaged, more real, and had some real fun with the movie.  Instead I felt sorry for both characters and cringed because those that do see this movie will probably think anyone who likes spanking has real problems.<br />Good acting (too good almost), good premise but a dud in terms of the writing and the characters.  I felt sorry for both Edward and Lee and the ending was so unreal as to make the movie a joke.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Most of us all ready know the plot. Little boy out in Illionis, kills his big sister on Halloween, is hospitalized, and comes back to create more terror. Main story...is about a couple of girls watching some kids across the street from each other on Halloween. A Psychiatrist with the Sheriff running around looking for the, now masked, escaped psycho killer.<br />The First thing that scares us is the Stalking. Michael, the psycho killer, does it right from the beginning. He lurks around the house outside spying on his big sister. Sneaks into the dark house...and well you know what happens next. And Michael does it again when he first stalks Laurie, main herione...hopefully still alive at the end, at the school, hiding behind cars and trees. Then of course the most terrifying for me, is when Michael is watching Annie, one of Lauries best friends, through the glass doors in the kitchen!<br />Obviously the second scariest thing for me would be the chase scenes and the almost not there killing scenes. It is done so very tastfully. Its not cheesy, its not gory, its not expected, its just damn good directing and atmosphere...<br />Which leads me to the Scariest part of this movie. The reason Halloween is so good is its Atmosphere, its Direction, and Acting. First, the story line is complimented well with a movie shot 80% in the dark, not just at night, but in the DARK. leaving our imagination to wonder what the hell is going on?! Which is scary no? the unknown? Second Carpenter is Excellent here with great camera angles...buy the Widescreen Version you wont be dissappointed. Lastly, Jamie Lee as Laurie is a Delight, what better way to follow mummy's footsteps! Donald is Brilliant as the almost pyschotic himself Doctor after the killer, and Nancy and PJ, and Charles, are all great additions to the movie.<br />This movie is great for well Halloween parties, get togethers, Friday the 13 movie marathons. And if you just want to scare yourself to the core....But dont watch this movie in at night, especially right before bed, you wont sleep at all, you know why? because all those shadows in your room are perfect hiding spaces for the Michael Meyers' of the world to wait for you to nod off....chilling!s movie in at night, especially right before bed, you wont sleep at all, you know why? because all those shadows in your room are perfect hiding spaces for the Michael Meyers' of the world to wait for you to nod off....chilling!

B00008HCCF|2.0|I thought I'd check out this new bright young chanteuse to see what the youth were up to.  Well, at the risk I'm sure of offending all the complimemtary reviewers and legions of Norah Jones fans I'd have to say that this is one of the most boring concerts I've ever been sedated by.  OK I probably should have realized what this was about before listening, but Gee Whiz!!  The band looks more conservative than most bankers and dentists....Norah gives new meaning to the lyrics from Hey Nineteen...sweet but very very dull.  (Just check out that sparky chatter between tunes.) Where's the spark, the angst, the intensity of youth?  Not to be seen here.  A very slick, safe and unchallenging offering is presented.  It's not jazz. (Try Billie Holiday, or even Diana Krall in Paris) It's not blues (Try Robert Johnson).  It's generic elevator music. If things are played this safe when you're Ms Jones' age, I can't imagine how conservative her musical future will be.  About as exciting as a trip to the bank I imagine.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I really have to laugh at some of the people who rate this album poorly.  It's like they bought The Strokes album looking for the next Radiohead.  Sorry people, if you don't like to have fun when you listen to some whiny nerd ramble on about conspiracy theories, THEN DON'T BUY A STROKES ALBUM.  But if you're somebody who likes to throw on a good CD with a bunch of friends, throw back a couple drinks, and have a good time you will love this album.<br />Room on Fire is very similar to Is This It?.  However, it is more of an extension rather than a rehash of the original.  It is The Strokes reaction to fame.  You Talk Way Too Much is a criticism of the news media and how they will say anything, no matter if it's true or not. Reptilia and What Ever Happened (&quot;Did they offend us and they want it to sound new?&quot;) are two of the best Strokes songs ever.  Automatic Stop and Under Control break new ground for the Strokes as they experiment with a reggae bassline and a ballad, respectively.  The rest of the album is mostly Julian Casablancas's view on past relationships.  <br />While this album does not break any new ground in the genre, it's not meant to.  If they're their third album fails to break new ground, then I will be accept some of the criticism that comes with it.  However, The Strokes do rock n roll party music and they do it well.  For anybody who is looking for anything else, they need not apply.

Funny, smart, sexy, non-intrusive special effects that add rather than detract from the story, plus acting and writing that will leave you in wonder and full of smiles at the end of each episode.<br />I think this is the best SF series ever conceived and executed. The feeling and camaradarie of the characters is evident on camera, and you will actually CARE about them - how many TV series can you say that about?<br />Dear FOX: for shame, for shame, for shame! You really blew it on this one...
B000002UB3|5.0|Hey, even though there are almost a thousand reviews online for this album, I just wanted to add my own two cents and say that Abbey Road is the best Beatles album.  How sad, how sad that they were unable to keep it all together.  I wish I had been there to hold their hands and help them through it all, I wish we had all been there.  life is funny, you know?  This one has the most creativity, gels together the best, showcases virtually all of their facets, and has their best production to boot, making it, for me, their most listenable and consistent full album.  I have lots of Beatles favorite songs, but this is one album that I can put in and listen to almost the whole thing with nary a complaint.  How many of today's CDs can you say that about?  How will you answer when today's CDs are over 30 years old?  These guys did it all.  Thank you, Beatles, for finding yourselves in your music and letting us experience it all with you.  Too bad there can never be a reunion...
B00009TB5G|5.0|First, let me say that I have not read the books -- and I don't really intend to.  I'm not a real fan of the whole fantasy/sci-fi genre, so I tend to have little patience for complaints that such-and-such minor character, who was in the book, didn't appear in the film.  I just don't care.<br />However, I do like good movies, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Two Towers in the theater.  However, I always had the feeling that I just didn't get some parts of the plot: for example, what's with Gandalf the Grey becoming Gandalf the White?  Not to mention all the non-sensical names for everything, I found it pretty hard to keep all the names for all the characters and locations straight in my head, what with all the plot twists and so forth.  <br />As a result, as much as I loved the spectacle of the LOTR films, I sometimes had the feeling that I was watching the first movie filmed entirely in the fictional language of Klingon.<br />That being said, the additional material in the Extended Edition of the Two Towers really helped me to better grasp various plot points and character motivations, making the movie a much fuller, enriching experience.  It still will not drive me to go out and read the books, but it makes a very good movie even better. Yes, it is long, but the additional forty-odd minutes of material are worth it.  Highly recommended.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I love the Beatles and have for years.  So when I heard about this CD coming out I was very excited.  I was planning on buying it soon and then the greatest thing happened...I won the CD at my Christmas office party.  <br />The music sounds great - very real, very true. Anyone who loves the Beatles will love this CD.  I haven't listened to the conversation CD yet but plan to the weekend.  <br />Simply great.

0060512806|4.0|An amazing story.  Stephenson is an excellent writer and pays attention to the details.  This book is indepth.  It was so close to non fiction, I had to go to the net and look up names, places, and events.  All of them were nailed, with the excpetions of things he changed to work within the story.  The book takes place at two time periods:  WWII and the late 1990's.  Both periods of time focus on two families, that are thrown together in both time periods.  The book does seem to drag a little in places but is very exciting and intricate in other places.  An ongoing Stephenson problem is with his endings.  This book although not a clear consise ending (yes it just kind of stops), actually works here (or I am just getting used to it).  Overall it was a very good book.  It is long, but worth the time you put into it.
0385504209|5.0|This is a very enjoyable read for an airplane trip or rainy vacation day.  A deranged albino monk, a secret society, a new theory of the life of Christ, and secret codes all make for an enjoyable fiction ride.  This isn't a serious literary work, but for it's genre, this book is everything I expect from light entertainment with a twist.
B0000CABJ1|3.0|It is just so unusual to remind people how much in this industry, we often seem to overlook the 70's scene. There were just so many artists that absolutely took the cake. There was Chicago, The Bee Gees, and there was also the Diva of Disco, Donna Summer. Throughout the 70's and early 80's, the legend proved to have the typical stuff, knocking out a whole onslaught of other Disco acts during that era. Still, it is just a shame that many polls, overlook Donna Summer as that influence, as much as they think of Saturday Night Fever, and The Bee Gees. But unlike them, Donna Summer has proven herself as a survivor, and hopefully more.<br />The Journey: The Very Best Of Donna Summer, is a collection of Donna's mega-hits from her era in the 70's and early 80's. The songs range very well, including This Time I Know Its For Real, Love To Love You Baby, Hot Stuff, and the seductive Bad Girls. The album also includes I Will Go With You, a not new, nearly new, but more recent song, from her Live record, Live &amp; More... Encore from 1998, and a few new songs as well. The flipside is that many people are surprised to see another Greatest Hits record out from Donna, largely because of the recent 20th Century Masters collection that Universal issued earlier in 2003. The other drawback, is that it is an updated version to her 1994 Greatest Hits collection, Endless Summer. Unfortunately, that record is no longer being sold, and folks will have to consider the new one, if they can't find the last one.<br />All that I can say, is that I hope Donna Summer, the Diva from Boston, can intend to make a new record soon. If not, she still has made an impact among thousands and thousands of Dance Divas. Maybe she'll reconsider herself from not issusing new records, and change her mind.
0066620996|5.0|This book is a refreshing change from the leadership books which expound various flashy leadership skills as the determinant for corporate greatness.  Clearly disciplined execution and focusing on the key profitability ratio produce a shift from mediocrity to greatness.  This book is a definite read for the business leader. To move beyond greatness and achieve optimization, read Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self, then infuse Optimal Thinking into every facet of your corporation.
B00000273M|4.0|The bangles rock (in the pop sense.) I think that the band depicts everything 80s a little over the top and ooo so cute with a rough edge. The Bangles are the best. Love em', hate em'. Its just like really cool slumber party music...The kinda stuff Kelly Osbourne would listen too when she wanted to feel like a girl....U catch the drift.....There is a time and a place 4 Bangle music and its &quot;paint are nails a funky shade while watching horror filcks and smoking weed Friday night&quot;
B0000AK7AB|5.0|Disappointed in Babe:  Pig in the City, I went back to watching the original.  Ever after a dozen viewings, this original film retains its power to entertain, endear, and raise emotional and psychological issues uncommon among children's films.<br />The magic was in the details of this film, and not just in production design.  After all, busy production design couldn't make the second film any more engaging than it was.  No, the original Babe's charm lies in the wonderful characterizations of Rex and Fly, the sweet yet prejudiced sheep dogs, lovable in nature, but with character flaws that make them as rich as any human character; it lies in the matter-of-fact Farmer Hoggett, played with sincerity and humour by James Cromwell; it lies in the impeccably tailored voice work, from the braying ewe Maa to the hilariously squeaky mice, the booming horse, and that oh-so-greasy cat; it lies in the beautifully rendered, pudgy voice work for Babe by Christine Cavanaugh, who was sorely missed in the second film; and it lies in the pure heart of moments like the slamming of the gate at the sheep dog trial at the end, Rex and Fly's endearing kiss against a soaring crane shot, the eerie dramatic irony of Babe facing Farmer Hoggett's rifle, and Fly's loss of her puppies.  And the film's famously ironic tone is the icing on the cake, spearheaded by a highly effective \\"naive narrator\\", which subverts the fairy-tale tone of the piece and adds dimensions that serve to add both humour and intellectual complexity to the story.<br />This film was well deserving of its Best Picture and Best Screenplay Oscar nominations, a film smart enough for adults but joyful enough for children.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a romantic novel  which I absolutely recommend to readers. If one is able to comprehend a 19th century woman's role and priorities, entailment, and discover insights on characters within letters and situations, you will surely appreciate this novel. I would mostly recommend it to readers ages 16 and up.<br />One of my favorite chapters was chapter 34. In this chapter Darcy declares to Elizabeth his love for her and proposes matrimony to her. He does this when his love for her is at a stage where he disregards all obstacles that kept him from doing this earlier. He also does it at a point where Elizabeth's anger towards him is at a crucial point.<br />One of literary devices that I mostly appreciate was irony. For example, in chapter 34 Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being prideful while Elizabeth accuses Darcy of being prejudiced. Even though both characters have fault in pride and prejudice, I found it quite ironic how the reader may think that Darcy symbolizes pride while Elizabeth symbolizes prejudice. Yet these two characters are viewed in the opposite way, where Darcy symbolizes prejudice and Elizabeth pride.<br />I really did like this book, mostly because it did not bore me. I hope other readers appreciate this novel as much as I did.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|To be honest, three CDs are *still* not enough to represent Bruce Springsteen's career.  What he needs is a massive boxed set of six to seven CDs to annotate the various stages of his songcraft.  However, until then, given that the Tracks boxed set consists only of B-sides and outtakes, The Essential Bruce Springsteen is the most comprehensive overview of The Boss' music available.<br />The Greatest Hits collection from 1995 hit #1 on the album charts, but it was a joke in terms of artistic representation, beginning its chronicle only with &quot;Born to Run&quot;.  The Essential Bruce Springsteen corrects this mistake, including Springsteen's crucial, hyper-verbose early years with &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; (a #1 single for Manfred Mann).  The earliest Springsteen songs were, quite frankly, not all that strong, with too many lyrics, too much of an aspiration towards Bob Dylan, but without the lyrical grace.  Still, to know an artist, you have to know where he comes from.  Springsteen's coming of age, when he simplified his lyrics and sentiments and beefed up his music (achieving more poetry and grace in the process), can be observed in this set with &quot;Rosalita&quot;, &quot;Thunder Road&quot; and the seminal &quot;Born to Run&quot;, one of the great high-energy rock performances of all time.  From then on it's classic after classic -- the poignant lyrics and emotional singing of &quot;The River&quot;, the stark despair of &quot;Nebraska&quot;, the hit-filled Born in the U.S.A. years, Springsteen's folk revisitation with The Ghost of Tom Joad, and finally to the grandiose introspection of late tracks &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; and &quot;The Rising&quot;.<br />While the constraints of the two CDs means that only singles and the biggest hits are included, for the most part, it's still a far more lucid representation of this rock icon.  And typical of The Boss, he fattens up the package and gives you more than your money's worth by including an entire disc of rare and live tracks.  There are many gems here -- &quot;Held Up without a Gun&quot;, the live &quot;Code of Silence&quot; and &quot;Trapped&quot; being my favourites.  From a man who still gives marathon four-hour concerts well past the age of 50, this shouldn't come as a surprise; I'm just astonished at how many unreleased songs Springsteen can still pull out of the vault, even after having released a four-disc boxed set of them already.<br />Perhaps, in the grand tradition of rock artists, Springsteen is reluctant to release a &quot;best-of&quot; boxed set because he has no wish to put any kind of punctuation mark on his career that can be interpreted as retirement.  All well and good.  Completists should simply go for the albums.  But for the newcomer to Springsteen's music who doesn't know where to start, faced with a massive catalogue of over a dozen albums, half a dozen live collections and two boxed sets.  I was in that position several years ago, and I can say that if this collection had existed back then, it would have made my foray into Springsteen's music much smoother and more intelligible.  Seasoned fans will still be able to delve into the rare tracks and live performances, but for newbies looking to start on The Boss, this is absolutely the best place.
0192833553|4.0|My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy?s marriage proposal. It amazed me how she was still able to say yes after she was insulted in every way possible especially after disliking him so much in the beginning of the novel.<br /> This book is appropriate for anyone who is able to appreciate well-written literature. Anyone would enjoy reading this book, from teenagers to adults.<br /> One literary device I appreciated was epigram, which is a brief, clever, and usually memorable statement. An example of this would be ?It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in wants of a wife? which is found on the first page of the novel. The entire novel was based on this quote. Mrs. Bennet wanted to get all five of her daughters married before her husband died.<br /> I liked the novel. I found Elizabeth?s romance with Darcy intriguing. It was interesting how in the beginning she rejected his proposal and disliked him, and at the end she marries him.
B00003CXE7|1.0|This movie was lots of fun. The story was so gritty and affecting. I remember after watching it for the first time, I made my own sword from scrap wood & laid into some mailboxes and windshields.  Ancient Rome burned in my heart.  GLADIATOR charges the blood with electricity. The characters are so compelling, deep and human. The villain, played to perfection by Joaquin Phoenix, was pure brilliance.  Russell Crowe dips his hand into the gritty Earth and produces a hero of uncommon, brutal honesty.  The lions, the vicious cheers of a blood-thirsty crowd...    I give this movie exactly ONE STAR.  The story, even for an epic, was compelling for a grand total of five minutes.  The plot blunders predictably along, creating little or no emotional momentum & absolutely no sense of adventure.  Kids in a sandbox could contrive a better story than this piece of garbage.  About an hour into this vacuum, I just wanted Russell Crowe to kill Commodus so I could get back to my life.      Joaquin Phoenix \\"vexed\\" me with his paper thin performance as the twisted, impotent usurper.  Perhaps Phoenix can't be blamed for the job he turned in?  They gave him such a narrow, cardboard role to play - a weak foil to the driven, fertile, masculine Maximus.  There was no descent into madness; something vaguely human that would have at least given some dimension to this silly story.      Ridley Scott created a beautiful film.  The cinematography was masterful - like a crazy European car commercial.  A wild, powerful sports car rolls into the coliseum, everyone stops their torturous acting & begins to feel the fine interiors, check under the hood, blare some music and then comment on the trunk space.  Maybe a quick ride to showcase the vehicle's performance?  A lion could sit on the hood and roar a little bit - an obvious appeal to the grunting desire to identify with virility and power that lurks in all of us.  Oh well.    The mass appeal of this bore was a clear demonstration of the famous quote: \\"a sucker is born every minute.\\"

B000002KE2|4.0|You don't have to go far to find people who hate metal and you don't have to go far to find people who hate Black Sabath. As the elder statesmen and the undisputed pioneers of Heavy Metal the band has definitely had its ups and downs. I've been listening to them since the beginning. This is their best effort by far. To put it simply, Vol.4 does the job its supposed to do. To me, no matter what form any music takes; hard, soft whatever -  that's what makes good music. Best cuts - Wheels of Confusion, Tomorrow's Dream, Supernaut, Snowblind. ...damn, the whole album is good!
B0000009S3|5.0|This is the first time FZ really played the guitar he was known for.Before this he was the least experienced and the weakest musicianwise in the Mothers.But he always was the mind behind the band.On this CD he steps up for the first time as the worlds greatest guitarist.Who New? This stands up to any music ever made.On this CD he is the Miles Davis of guitar.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just received my copy and I'm very pleased. If you missed this show, you missed something really special. You'll find yourself really caring about these three dimensional characters. The stories are engaging and well written. The dialogue smart. The production values beyond anything on television. This was truly a jewel and personally, I miss it. The DVD set has all the episodes in order and the three episodes FOX (the brain dead network) never aired before pulling the show as well as some fun extras. There are no aliens, rubber monsters, or phasers, but watch one episode and you'll be hooked, waiting for the theatrical release coming (I hope) soon. Magic on television doesn't happen very often but this show had it. A shame FOX has no vision, no taste, and no patience. <BR>Darrell
B00005QGAT|4.0|This album was released 11 years before me. It was around the disco era ( I think) and this album was (I think) pretty modern for 1979. It is very different to any of MJ's other albums one album I think relates to it a bit is &quot;Thriller&quot; fom then, his work never sounded like this. This a very soulful album with classics like &quot;Don't Stop Til'You Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Rock With You&quot; I find it a good album, See I was brought up with &quot;Bad&quot; And &quot;Dangerous&quot; so anything before that is very very strange. But I like this album The songs are great and I will always love this.
B000002J09|5.0|This CD is absolutely awesome!!!  Led Zeppelin is one of my all-time favorite bands, and this is possibly their best CD of all.  On this classic album is possibly the greatest rock anthem of all time- Stairway to Heaven, along with other equally awesome songs such as Black Dog, Misty Mountain Hop, and When the Levee Breaks.  An awesome CD.
B00005QGAZ|4.0|Right now, I feel sorry for MJ being put all these charges against him, people should give him credit like for this, The Largest Selling Album Of All Time...&quot;Thiller&quot;. Though several things knock this review a star down. Though I'm reviewing the special edition, the original album has only 9 tracks. and &quot;The Lady In My Life&quot; is the weakest track. This album has alot of highlights like &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot;, and &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot;. This album is well put together. Please note: This Is MJ's last album in this type of sound. This is the album that made him a household name bad or good. If you are collecting MJ stuff this is ONE ALBUM YOU SHOULD DEFINITLEY NOT FORGET.
1565123875|5.0|Young Kambili's father is a presence in his Nigerian community. He is larger than life--a physically big, economically powerful man who raised himself from nothing to preside over factories and the only newspaper in the country brave enough to trumpet the corruption of the latest government. He is a godly man, a man who prays so long before a meal that the food becomes cold, a benefactor whose generosity has made his local Catholic church a thing of beauty and prosperity. He inspires awe in many, and outright worship in more than a few.<br />And so, how can his family--his teenaged daughter, her brother Jaja and her mother--not love him? How can they complain when his fervor to keep them all righteous and spotless in God's eyes tips into rigidity and, ultimately, into violence?<br />Purple Hibiscus explores, through the eyes of its young protagonist, the dicotomy of life with a Great Man who is a dictator to his own family. The situations and the characters are utterly believable; even the scenes that made me flinch were so beautifully written that I could not dismiss the complex glue that held this family together--the economic dependence, the paternalism, the order that flies in the face of the country's chaos, and, yes, the love that can't believe that things will only get worse.<br />This could be a grim tale, but the complexity of the characters, the candor of the narrator and the beautifully precise sense of place raise it above its painful subject matter. The family also serves as a microcosm of the country: in spite of the power games of an inept government, the paranoia, contradictions, and lingering taint of colonialism, the broken promises across the board--be it the diversion of fuel or non-payment of state salaries--in this book Nigeria's citizens, like the family members, only run when they have no choice. And in both cases, they do so with a sense of betrayal, a wounded love.<br />A simply written, complicated book.<br />Susan O'Neill, author, Don't Mean Nothing: Short Stories of Viet Namt Mean Nothing: Short Stories of Viet Nam
B00005QGAX|5.0|This album was in, singles wise more sucessful than &quot;Thriller&quot; Spawning 5 #1 Singles all of them released in a row! and got 8 top 10 singles. But, in sales wise, it didnt sell half of what &quot;Thriller&quot; sold. This album is a great album. In the Late '80's I think people were way into POP and not the &quot;Thriller&quot; type of music. So he made a good move, But hard-out fans of &quot;Off The Wall&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; abandoned his music because of this album. This brang him alot of success though just one, 1 in 12 people in the U.K own &quot;Bad&quot;!. The songs released were by far the best of the album. these are the singles that went to #1:<br />I Just Can Stop Loving You- #1!<br />Bad-#1!<br />The Way You Make Me Feel- #1!<br />Man In The Mirror- #1!<br />Dirty Diana- #1!<br />So this was a push up for success,  though it rarely happens his next album sone something that most artists cant do these days.....
0375432302|2.0|The premise of this book, a search for the mythical &quot;Holy Grail&quot; and the subsidiary premises - 1) that the Grail is not a &quot;thing&quot; but a person and/or relationship and 2) that a secret society has kept secret the location of this person and information for several centuries, is a little much to believe.<br />Dan Brown has a very good grasp of history in regard to the Grail, the Knights Templar, Freemasonry and the semi-legendary mythos surrounding these entities, but its clear that he hasn't really delved into the theological inconsistencies of adopting the theories espoused in his book.<br />To make the case that Mary Magdalene was the &quot;Holy Grail&quot;, that she rivaled Peter for the leadership of Christianity after Jesus' death, that she and Jesus had an intimate relationship that yielded children whose descendants are alive today, calls into the question the entire basis for Jesus' mission on Earth.  I can't think of a single main-line Protestant denomination that would accept such an idea - obviously the Roman Catholic church would reject it outright.<br />Such a scenario creates too many inconsistencies, in fact, to make possible the belief in Jesus as divine.  So what this book really ends up promoting, as an (un)intentional consequence, is unbelief.<br />If you're like me, you tend to think that ideas with little merit die-out rather quickly while those that bear strong elements of truth and believability survive.  The ideas espoused in this book have been around for a while, but never accepted by anything but a lunatic fringe of conspiracists.  Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic church continues to add members to its ranks worldwide 2000 years after the death of Christ.  You make the choice.
B000002BVN|5.0|Personally I love this album, The remixes are great and the extra 5 songs are really worth the wait since &quot;HIStory&quot;. &quot;Blood On The Dance Floor&quot; is one of my fave MJ songs ever so yeah.<br />I never really liked Remixes until this was released. So all MJ fans who still havent got this one yet why not buy the GREATEST REMIX ALBUM EVER!
6304493681|5.0|When I saw this movie in 1995, I was pleasantry shocked and sighed. I (still) believe this is one of the most influential movies to many movie creators. You can recognize what I meant from its world (virtual/real world), colors (cyber green), designs (opening title role and the battle at ruined museum!), and so on. If you love The Matrix, you can find &quot;core&quot; ideas from the Ghost.<br />As same as the original manga, this movie contents so many information to understand the &quot;real&quot; concept of the world. No wonder many people saw it at least twice. Well, when I saw it, I felt scare because the Ghost insisted me many possibility of net-future. It gave me an opportunity of thinking about what kind of future awaits us through Motoko's agony. This is just an animation. but quite worth to see over and over....you may find the idea of your identity (even it is not in a clear shape.)<br />Ghost 2 is going to be at theater in Japan (Spring 2004. The title is &quot;INNOCENT&quot;). I'm very looking forward to see it because this movie is going to show us the hint of the reason of being yourself in the cyber world through &quot;doll&quot; and &quot;dog&quot;. (According to Mr. Oshii, these are &quot;the key&quot; to understand the movie.) I  hope INNOCENT is even better than the Ghost 1.  Also, Ghost is showing as TV series now (Ghost in the Shell, Stand Alone Complex). I hope it is going to be released in the USA soon.  (......Sorry about my bad English.)
B00005QGAV|5.0|I grew up with this type of music, so this is my fave MJ album. See if Quincy was around for this album it would definitley not be the style of music it is, all of this album is very good, &quot;Gone Too Soon&quot; is the weakest track. As I said in My &quot;BAD&quot; Review &quot;Dangrous&quot; Done something most albums cant do and also done something most albums would/can do. It Sold more than its Predessor &quot;Bad&quot;!!. But it only got 1 #1 Single, &quot;Black Or White&quot; all the rest were very top 40. He sold out tours worldwide, but unfortunatley this would be the last HUGE selling MJ album. in 1993 he got charged with child molestation so this pretty much ruined his career. But this album is a total classic but it definitley deserved more credit than it got. If you should own two MJ albums only, This one &quot;DANGEROUS&quot; is defitley one you should have, it is one of his best.

1573300403|5.0|This is some of his recent Video HIStory, with singles that didnt match the massive success HIStory vol.1 did and videos that were on Vol.1 of this collection. Preferably I enjoy this DVD more than Vol.1. But the &quot;Blood On The Dance Floor&quot; Remix isnt my fave to date. This is one great DVD and it should definitley be in your collection!
B00005JMFI|5.0|Ok we have seen many of the cast members from SNL decide to leave the show and try their luck at other things....mostly acting.  Overall they usually do a good job but nothing really that great.  Some of the movies are really bad.  But Will Ferrell proves with this movie that he doesn't need SNL anymore.  His last movie, Old School, was great too and this one proves that he can do it on his own.  This is a movie the whole family can watch and enjoy.  I went to this movie last night and actually LOL when I saw it.  Will is funny and by far the most entertaining person to come out of SNL in a while.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped is Christinas Best work yet. In this album she has a something for everybody.   Some of my favorite songs are Cant Hold us down,Walk Away, Fighter, Infatuation,Impossible,Beautiful and Dirrty   But really they are all great.
B000063UR1|4.0|There are so many dated things about this movie...it's hard to know where to start!  Bruce Dern's opening costume...he looks like Jesus / a hippie.  The Joan Baez tracks.  The oh-so-70s environmental message.  The STAR TREK level instrument panels.  The hair styles.<br />It's fascinating to see what was for 1971-72 the cutting edge of special effects.  The movie was directed by guy who did effects for 2001:A SPACE ODESSEY, so you know they're good.  And they actually still hold up fairly well. <br />The plot of the movie, where Dern is the only crewmember who is interested in keeping the last vestiges of earth's plant life alive, is a bit thin, to say the least.  One wonders, if earth is losing all its plants, is sending some of them up into space REALLY the only way they can think to keep some alive?  <br />Anyway, I still love this movie.  The passions running underneath the politics are very real.  Dern is driven to commit a horrible act, and then is driven mad with guilt.  He gives a masterful performance in a role that truly suits his rather unusual talents.  He brings a deep, abiding sadness to the role, so that the final shot of him still brings tears to my eyes, more than 30 years after first seeing the movie.<br />And the robots!  Huey, Dewey &amp; Louie are the pre-cursors to R2-D2.  They are clunkier than a movie robot should be, yet there is something quite engaging and human about them.  They are remarkable expressive and they actually become characters we care about...partially because Dern invests humanity in them...or tries to.<br />I suppose at the time it was meant to be a cautionary tale about &quot;taking care of the earth,&quot; but the message (though still apt) is terribly dated in its presentation.  But the humanity of the movie, and the amazing leap forward for special effects, make SILENT RUNNING worth taking a look at...especially if you're, let's say, age 35 or older.  Kids, no doubt, will HATE the movie.<br />By the way, it is rated &quot;G.&quot;  There is some mild cussing and some brief but brutal violence.  I think a &quot;PG&quot; is more correct, to be honest.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Great Movie. Go see it now
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie is defenitely in my top 3 favorites! This movie is fresh, funny, moving, and a great message! I would recommend this movie to anyone! Not just kids will enjoy this movie, but adults also will!
B0000025JT|5.0|Her biggest selling album, GUILTY is easily Barbra Streisand's best contemporary pop effort to date.  Barry Gibb's skilled production hand gives GUILTY an added sense of cohesiveness, something that was sorely lacking from many of Streisand's late-seventies pop efforts.  Gibb (along with Albhy Galuten and brothers Robin and Maurice) also had a hand in writing every one of the nine melodic songs and even duets on two of them.      Their pairing produced a monster hit with the riveting title track (#3 Pop, #5 Adult Contemporary), however it's actually the other Streisand-Gibb smash duet \\"What Kind Of Fool\\" (#10 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary) that proves to be the disc's show-stopper.  Gibb's production and voice are an inarguable key to GUILTY's success, but it is Streisand's magnificent vocals that provide the album with it's soul - that's right SOUL!  The chart-topping smash \\"Woman In Love\\" (#1 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary) was the leadoff single and stands a slice of pure pop perfection, with Streisand's performance as thrilling as any ever captured on record.      Amazingly enough for a pop record, the remaining six tracks more than hold up to the three big hits.  The restrained ballads \\"Run Wild\\" and \\"The Love Inside\\" are absolutely gorgeous, while the seven minute-plus \\"Make It Like A Memory\\" plays out like mini-pop symphony.  Barbra even ventures into dance territory with \\"Life Story\\" and the international hit \\"Promises\\" and really brings these tracks to life with a sexy exuberance.  Even the slightly dated light funk of \\"Never Give Up\\" is a slinky delight.  GUILTY was a massive hit upon release, hitting #1 on the Hot 200 and achieving Quintuple Platinum status in US sales and selling nearly 20 million copies worldwide.  This success is hardly surprising as GUILTY is simply everything a pop album should be.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is one of the first Cds that i have bought when it was relativly new.  You know, when you buy it and all of the singles havent come out yet.  Well this album is a four most definitely.  i'll just go thru the songs.  <BR>1.  Intro--good intro<BR>2. That song with LIL kim...i didnt like that song too much when i first heard it or when it came out but people liked it so ...<BR>3. Walk away---this is my song. she showcases her voice, the emotion is all there...5/5<BR>4.  Fighter---what's the point of rating?  Every1 has heard this<BR>5. interlude---she whispers something seductive in spanish<BR>6. Infatuation---this is my song! i was about to say that she showcases her voice but she always does that.  this song gets 4.5/5<BR>7&amp;8  Interlude &amp; Loving me 4 me---this is a sweet little R&amp;B song...i dont want to give everything 5/5 but i have to listen to this song when i pop in the CD<BR>9. Impossible---the song with Alicia Keys--6/5 this has an old skool flavor like &quot;You dont know my name..&quot;<BR>10.  I forgot the name of this song. 3/5.  the song annoyed me sometimes. i could listen to the 1st verse and skip.<BR>11. Beautiful<BR>12 &amp;13.  These are the rock songs of the album.  theyre decent.  i like track 12 especially.<BR>14.  Now this song is corny but i LOVE it. it is a filler, feel good song but i always listen to it.<BR>15. Get mine, get yours--this song should be renamed &quot;Freak's Anthem&quot; or something.  But it has a catchy tune.<BR>16.  DIRRTY<BR>17. Interlude--similar to 1st intro. Nice<BR>18. The Voice within<BR>19. Song about Daddy 4/5...<BR>20.  &quot;Singing my song&quot; or whatever. She should have released this song instead of Voice within.  True, Voice Within was the song that made me love the album, but in this song she really kills it. She holds a note for like 10-12 seconds and it has a positive message without sounding corny or wack.  This song is 5/5 but is about 6 minutes long. I love the long songs but i know thatsome  ppl dont..oh yeah she has an extra little piece at the end of the album.  20 sec or so when the song is over some dude starts talking and she giggles and etc.  <BR>well buy the album...it is worth buying.  she has a cover with all of the words and etc so buy it...i'd tell u if it wasnt worth buying.
0553296981|4.0|Anne Frank kept a diary from 12 June 1942 to 1 August 1944 when Holland was under the Nazi regime. She accounts of the suffering of her family who spent this period of time hidden in the Secret Annexe, just before being arrested on 4 August 1944. Although the &quot;Diary&quot; is now fifty years old, it remains in my view an astonishing and excruciating account of what Jews had to endure during the Second World War. The evidence of Anne Frank's ferocious appetite for life gnaws at us still.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Only the Beatles could have a different version of a 33 year old album released in 2003 and have it sell a million copies (in America alone) in record time... for any other recording act out there,it would be pure fantasy,for these guys,reality.
0385504209|1.0|I read this based on many recommendations.  As long as you don't expect anything of higher quality than a typical waiting-at-the-airport book, go for it.  But don't count on it for anything else.  Stereotypical characters (an albino killer monk?  please!) and situations.  I'm glad I didn't buy this, but read a lent copy instead.
0553213105|5.0|I believe that this is an appropriate book for any age group.  I recommend this book to whoever is interested in reading it.  There is no violence, or any misconduct.  The only thing mainly talked about was of love and the social class differences in the 19th century.  One literary device that I appreciated is called allegory.  Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings, and events stand for abstract and moral concepts.  An example of this is the distinction people made in social classes.  We can see this clearly in the way Mrs. Bennet desperately wanted her daugters to marry rich men, but Elizabeth wanted to marry for love.  This moral concept shows readers that money, even though it has a great effect on many people, does not buy true love.  I believe it has been one of the best books I have read so far.  It was a beautiful, yet confusing love story.  My favorite chapter was Chapter 18 from Volume 3.  In this chapter Elizabeth and Darcy resolve the unanswered question of their relationship.  Darcy had come with Bingley to Longbourn to see if he could make Elizabeth love him, and he knew from Lady De Bourgh's lecture to him about Elizabeth's evilness, that Elizabeth must have cared for him.  Elizabeth insists that he only came to love her because she did not try to please him.  She tells him &quot;You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone.  I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them.&quot; She is still embarrassed by the way that she misjudged him from the beginning.  He is just as embarrased of his first proposal to her and his behavior toward her until that proposal.  Since both Jane and Elizabeth have been proposed to, the entire neighborhood hears of the engagements, and both Elizabeth and Jane recieve congratulations.  This is my favorite chapter because this is where all the conflicts are resolved, and thus begins a happy ending.
B00005JM02|5.0|Great story, characters and special effects.  I highly recommend this DVD.
B00008DDSC|2.0|Wow, there are things I really loved about this movie.  Turning the love story into a kinky, sexy, controlling, postmodern, postcolonial version of Americana in the workplace.  It makes you want to roll over and get your butt slapped.  Until the end that is.  Then the filmmakers tank the whole film by forcing it to fit within the boring Hollywood convention of a love story.  They even use reporters in the film, not to make a statement on our over powering draw to the media (especially to see the foreign and uncomfortable), but to make the interviewee's statement grounded in normality.  It's a fantastic movie if you don't watch the last half hour....
B000089RVX|5.0|The real reason I had bought Fallen was because people thought that Bring Me To Life was such a good song, so I went ahead and bought it. I can tell you I couldn't have been more wrong to think that only one song would satisfy me, every song does. Well, there is one song that doesn't- Tourniquet- I think that it is a very weak track. Some songs I have listened to I haven't liked at first, such as Hello, Haunted, and My Last Breath, but now I really think they're great songs. And it went the opposite with Tourniquet, because that was my original favorite (yeah, after I had listened to every song I had liked it the most, and now I like it the least!). The standouts on this album I think are Whisper, Taking Over Me, My Immortal, and My Last Breath. They are all very good songs. But there's one song that will ALWAYS be one of my favorites, and that is Whisper, because it has probably the most effort put into it. <br />Going Under: 9/10<BR>This song has a good beat to please people, but it really does have a small lack of effort. It used to be my favorite, but I listened and listened more to other songs on the C.D. It is a great opener though, and the reason I gave it a little less points than it deserves is because of the comparisons to other songs on the album.<br />Bring Me To Life: 9/10<BR>This is a great song, just a little overplayed. However, I'll still like it when it comes on VH1, I'm not at all tired, but again, in comparison to other songs, it is a little on the weak side.<br />Everybody's Fool: 9/10<BR>This song is just missing something... I keep wondering what, but I just can't find what it is. This song is different because it is the only song that has nothing to do with pain somebody's feeling, physically or in their heart. I think a little more effort would make this song perfect.<br />My Immortal: 11/10 (I have done this with 3 other songs)<BR>This is an awesome song. It is so beautiful, and Amy Lee's voice makes you feel the pain (and this one, it's going through your heart). She has an amazing voice, and she's proved it with this song. Definitely listen to this song if you buy Fallen. You'll be impressed with this song band version or not.<br />Haunted: 8.5/10<BR>It's not the best song, but it's not the worst either. It really doesn't impress me much at all. This was my original least favorite, but now it's second. I still cannot figure out why people like this song so much. But I still like it a lot more than I used to. There is no real 'bad' song off of Fallen, except for Tourniquet.<br />Tourniquet: 7/10<BR>This is a very weak track. It's suicidal message doesn't impress me the way Whisper does. This is the worst song on the album, PERIOD, and I think that Soul Embraced had no talent with \\"My Tourniquet\\". Listening to this song, you can tell how much more talent Amy and Ben have than Rocky Gray does.<br />Imaginary: 10/10<BR>This isn't the best song, but so what? It deserves a 10/10. It is well-written though, and it shows no lack of effort. I don't have anything more to say about it than listen to it.<br />Taking Over Me: 11/10<BR>This is a beautiful rock-ballad. It is definitely the most unique, because it is a rock-ballad, not a hard rock song, and not a ballad, but a rock-ballad. Perfect for the next single, and in my top four favorites. It has many similarities with My Last Breath, the other rock-ballad on the album.<br />Hello: 9/10<BR>This is a My Immortal-like song, with only the fact that Amy wrote it and not Ben. It isn't as powerful as My Immortal either. This is the most depressing song on the c.d., but it doesn't touch me as much as My Last Breath for some reason.<br />My Last Breath: 11/10<BR>I used to not like this song at all, but now I realize this is a beautiful rock-ballad, and it really made me tear the time I heard it that made me really love this song. A very effortful suicidal ballad, this song has everything.<br />Whisper: 11/10<BR>This song is the only song that has always been one ofmy favorites, and it's not going to fall anytime soon. This is a great song, just listen to the Don't Turn Away/Don't Give Into the Pain chorus, and you'll already like this song. This song and Going Under have many similarities. The suicidal message is hidden in the song, but you can infer that it's there.<br />Evanescence's Fallen is a great album. I recommend that you go out to a local music shop and buy this c.d. I guarantee that you will if not love it, at least like it.
B00009RDG9|2.0|This movie is contrived and implausible, and I don't know how it can be billed as a thriller with its total lack of suspense.  Why these fine actors chose to act in such a film, I'll never know, but I don't know how either of them kept from rolling their eyes when both of them, during a police chase, found time to forge and create their own knives.  Give me a break.  The tiny side plots about Del Toro's love life and Jones' work for the wildlife service are there, I suppose, to make their characters seem more interesting.  The only thing I can imagine making them more interesting is their refusing these roles.<br />I'm so glad I rented this movie before purchasing.  Now I only have to lament the loss of four bucks.<br />Skip it.
B000088E6D|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS GUY. HE'S SO RELAXING TO LISTEN TOO!!!!<BR>CANT WAIT TO FIND MORE OF HIS CD'S<BR>BRING THEM ON.
B000002UAX|2.0|About a third of the songs on this CD are memorable for their quality.  Although many of the songs are interesting, this CD is really tough to get through without hitting the &quot;skip&quot; button about 20 times.  There is a great album in here somewhere.  You just have to find it.
0385504209|5.0|I will be honest.  I'm not much of a reader, in fact I wait until 'the movie' of a book someone suggests to me.  However, when a friend insisted I read a book called The Da Vinci Code, I felt inclined to see what the hype was about.<br />Wow.  What a ride.  From start to finish, it's gripping suspense and engaging characters kept me enthralled.<br />I'm a believer of Dan Brown and have since purchased Angels &amp; Demons which is almost equal in captivation.  Do yourself a favour and read this, you WON'T be at all dissapointed.  And don't forget the movie in 2005 :-P
0945353731|1.0|This book was soo boring i read 2 pages then i burnt it.  If you read this book i will personaly burn it for u.......  SHe dint need to rite a fricken diary she just wanted to become famouse and she wanted people to feel sorry for her!!!!!!!
0061015725|3.0|I'll keep this simple: The journey is much more interesting then the destination.  This book has a facinating premise, more character development then the average Crichton novel, and is facinating for the first 400 pages.  However, the climax of the novel, is a letdown.  Chichton seems so intent on &quot;blowing us away&quot; that he opts for a silly, cheap plot twist that is telegraphed in the first 50 pages (I kept hoping Crichton was teasing and had something more interesting planned).  I like the book; I just wish that it had lived up to the promise of the first half of the novel.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I LOVE this soundtrack.  It's amazing, but like other reviewers have said, the cuts are mixed up.  As near as I can tell, the last cut, &quot;He's a Pirate&quot; somehow managed to begin the CD rather than finish it.  So, every cut is 1 number off.  Here's how I think they should be listed:<BR>1)He's a Pirate<BR>2)Fog Bound<BR>3)The Medallion Calls<BR>4)The Black Pearl<BR>5)Will and Elizabeth<BR>6)Swords Crossed<BR>7)Walk the Plank<BR>8)Barbossa is Hungry<BR>9)Blood Ritual<BR>10)Moonlight Serenade<BR>11)To the Pirate's Cave!<BR>12)Skull and Crossbones<BR>13)Bootstrap's Bootstraps<BR>14)Underwater March<BR>15)One Last Shot<br />Perhaps I'm wrong, but I think that's how it should be.  Other than the messed up cuts, this CD is great.  It is very piratey.  If you like that kind of music, I would also recommend the soundtrack to Sinbad: The Legend of Seven Seas.  But I think &quot;Pirates&quot; tops that.
B00006V9A0|3.0|Ahh, the 90s. Let us remember fondly of a time where flannel and torn denim were all the rage and no one ever went to a Pearl Jam concert without a Zippo lighter for fear of being ridiculed and humiliated. Soon the nonsensical rantings and string-breaking power chord melodies of one Kurt Cobain would epitomize all that was grunge. This singer/songwriter/shampoo hater was the frontman of Seattle based group Nirvana. The band's four albums all became best sellers and, until this day still dominate the playlists of rock radio stations. Now, more than 8 years after the genre defining group's  break up, Interscope Records releases a cd single with an album wrapped around it. I must say the very existence of Nirvanas new \\"album\\" (a collection of old songs and the unreleased 'You Know You're Right') mystifies me a bit, considering that you can hear Nirvana at just about any given time just by turning on the radio. But for what it's worth, the disc is a competent collection of 'vana essentials, including classics 'Come As You Are' and 'Lithium', despite being Interscope's sleazy attempt at making a quick buck. Buy this only if you don't already own a Nirvana album.
B00005JMFO|5.0|This is a wonderful film where 130 minutes just fly by in the blink of an eye.<br />There are many who might regard \\"Love Actually\\" as a chick flick.  Such a view is not warranted.  The film should appeal to all ages both male and female.<br />The film, in essence, is a collection of love stories that, in there own ways, have a touching humour and resonance.  The characters are strong although it is hard to go past the ageing rocker Billy Mack.  His line about Brittney Spears is worth the price of admission on its own.<br />See this film and have great laugh!
0060012218|5.0|This book was great. The idea oh having a gay club and putting a front up of it being a geography club so no one wants to join it, is a very cool idea for a very close-minded place. This is a must read for all gay and straight teens alike. Everyone can put themselves in the spot of these teens during high school.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|i listened to this album over and over again and i must say and I dare say that there is something very special here, considering the whole point of this album is for the Beatles to record something that is back to the basics, without all the frills and overdubbing.  and yes i DO prefer the &quot;de-Spectorized&quot; version of Long and Winding road.  this versions sounded more poignant considering it became the Beatle&quot;s swansong.  I'd say buy this album or better yet grab the LP if you can, this is certainly a classic in the making
B0000027I6|5.0|Near flawless. Previous posters noted correctly that this is no casual listen. The pacing and dynamics are entirely lost when this isn't listened to in its entirety. That's not to say that the individual tracks don't stand up by themselves, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. For its 75 or 80 minutes, &quot;Amused to Death&quot; is experiential in a way that is far more akin to film than music. And while I detest the breathless melodrama that comes with saying that X, Y or Z &quot;transcends the medium,&quot; this work comes as close as any I'm aware of.   <br />Substantively, &quot;Amused&quot; is Waters' most focused leftist commentary. While there are predictable broadsides on canned religion (&quot;What God Wants&quot;) and war (&quot;The Bravery of Being out of Range&quot;), Waters' target is the dehumanizing effect of consumerism and a pop culture that serves only to perpetuate the bogus virtues of supply and demand. <br />Sonically, this disc was among the best of its time. Unlike Radio KAOS, its production style has aged gracefully. 11 years after its release, &quot;Amused&quot; sounds sharp and timely. Q-Sound, an effect which expands the stereo spectrum, is used sparingly throughout. (If you're sitting in the sweet spot between your speakers, EFX such as ringing phones and barking dogs will sound as if they are originating in the next room.) <br />Those who hated the production style of KAOS will appreciate the organic approach of &quot;Amused.&quot; For example, Graham Broad's kit in the beginning of &quot;Bravery&quot; may be the biggest of the era's BIG DRUM sounds. <br />More importantly, vocals are less processed than on previous efforts. The character of Waters' vocal style is found more in the mouth noises (clicks and pops) than in his less-than-perfect pitch. Here it is recorded with amazing intimacy (presumably with a shotgun mic to pick up the tics and &quot;imperfections&quot; that most engineers try to filter out).           <br/>Much has been made of the guest appearances of the sidemen. While I'm not a huge Beck fan, it's hard to argue he wasn't a good choice here. His best work can be found in (the seemingly misplaced?) &quot;Three Wishes.&quot;  <br />Standout cuts are &quot;The Bravery of Being out of Range&quot; (this version is superior to the live take on &quot;In the Flesh&quot;) and the title track. &quot;Perfect Sense,&quot; which became something of a centerpiece of Waters' live show, is a great setup for &quot;Bravery&quot; complete with cameo from Marv Albert. <br />David Gilmour is among my favorite guitarists, period. But let's face facts -- Waters' solo work has a life to it that post-Final Cut PF simply doesn't have. When they parted ways, Waters took PF's sense of drama, suspense and lyrical edge with him. <br />For those who can't help feeling that PF's post-Waters work is vaguely flat, the missing ingredients you're looking for are packed into &quot;Amused to Death.&quot; &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; and &quot;KAOS&quot; only hinted at what &quot;Amused&quot; would become. And while some of us hope for a belated encore, it's tough to imagine Waters can top himself.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I actually first heard this music in a commercial while I was watching Saturday Night Live.  I was immediatly hooked.  I downloaded some songs, then bought the album.  Damian and the female singer have beautiful voices, and the cello is breathtaking.  Emotion is conveyed so well through the music.  This CD was and still is being played over and over.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|For those who have been knocking this album, listen to it a few more times.  Dream Theater has eclipsed the kitsh cheesyness so apparent in their earlier albums to come up with something really special (and altogether different)  After the Danny Elfman wannabe 6 degrees, I nearly didn't buy this album.  But being such a huge fan of SCENES and AWAKE, I had to indulge.  Well, this album is better than Awake if not quite as good as SCENES.  It displays no real arc in music, and the sound is less operatic, but on the upside is is much more accesible to a crowd.  People who don't play guitar don't really want to hear psuedo-chromatic scales in E while the drums are playing in a 9/4 and the keyboard is playing in the key of G.  People want to rock out, and this is a perfect example of Four amazing musicians cutting the crap and going balls to the wall.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|This CD is great!  When you first listen to it you are bound to love the songs.  Popular is certainly a show stopper (or a cd stopper).  The finale is more of a disapointment.  joel Grey is fantastic in WOnderful!  idina menzel has a very strong voice.  You will definetly fall in love with the songs which could be a bad thing.  After you listen to the cd so many times it will get on yur nerves and you will never wwant to listen to it again!!  I would sugest buying this only if you are going to see the shows, or else however great the music is you wont understand it!
1400034779|2.0|This novel came highly recommended to me by a friend whose book judgement I trust, but I was halfway into it when I realized, &quot;My god.  This is African Encyclopedia Brown!&quot;<br />I like the way the author describes Africa, and it did have a sense of place, but it seemed like such a gossamer thin plotline throughout.  Silly even.  I always knew what would happen next. <br />Liking a book is a very personal experience, but for me, &quot;Poisonwood Bible,&quot; was a more substantive, enjoyable and dimensionalized view of Africa.
B000059PR5|5.0|I remember there was TREMEMNDOUS hype before the movie came out.  Many many people were talking about this upcoming movie The Day After and how it graphically depicts nuclear war and its aftermath.  On the first night it came out in 1983,  100 million people tuned in to watch it.<br />     Well,  I was one of them,  and Ill tell you its shocking,  its chilling but it is some movie.  We were all deeply affected by it and its just so apparent that nuclear weapons should not be used in war anymore.  Theyre just too dangerous!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead has done it again. The only album I haven't heard of theirs is their first, but every other one is magnificent: music you can't possibly stop thinking about and (I hate to say this but...) works of art. Hail to the Thief is no exception. This album has been claimed to be a return to roots.<br />Hardly.<br />It's a mix of older and newer Radiohead, but not. I know I'm contradicting myself but listen to the album and then their previous recordings and you'll understand what I'm saying. They incorporate the miraculous guitar work of The Bends and OK Computer with the electronic noise and inaccessibility of Kid A and Amnesiac, but the end result is a destination Radiohead has never been before. If you want proof of this, listen to the opening track, '2+2=5'. The song opens with a strange guitar rhythm in 7/4 time and ends it with a fabulous blend of guitar and vocals, making this an Amnesiac version of 'Paranoid Android' off OK Computer.<br />Every song is fantastic, even if some (i.e. 'The Gloaming,' 'I Will') take a little while to fully appreciate. However, if you were a fan of Radiohead's later work, getting used to these tracks shouldn't be a problem. The best songs on this album in my opinion are the afore-mentioned '2+2=5,' 'Where I End And You Begin,' 'There There,' 'A Punch-Up At A Wedding,' 'Myxomatosis,' and especially the closer, 'A Wolf At The Door', which is definitely Radiohead's best and (arguably) the best song ever recorded. The songs are helped out tremendously on this record by the addition of more guitarwork, but especially by Thom Yorke's voice. This is the best his vocal work has ever been and it's nice to have it at the forefront of the band once more. (P.S. 'A Wolf At The Door' is not Radiohead's first Dylan homage. That would be 'Subterranean Homesick Alien' off OK Computer, a title that has Dylan's 'Subterranean Homesick Blues' to thank.)<br />Simply put, this is a masterpiece. But what else can we expect from Radiohead? Here they prove that they truly are the world's greatest living band. And anyone who says otherwise should turn off their Justin Timberlake and get some real music like this.
0517053616|5.0|Quite simply the greatest writer of all time, Shakespeare belongs on every bookshelf.  I have this, and it is a treasure.  For those of you who sweated through Shakespeare in high school, give it a try.  You might be surprised by some of the stories you never knew.  I would gladly have paid fifty bucks for one of these, and was thrilled to get it for twenty in hardcover.  If you have kids, this is a must-have.  If you don't, get it anyway.  Although there are no footnotes, or any attempt to 'translate' King's English into American, I think these things are basically unnecessary.  The sonnets also deserve a perusal, but I like the tragedies the best, particularly Julius Caesar and Titus Andronicus.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack....absolutely amazing.  Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer are both geniuses and DESERVE an oscar.  I recently stopped by [...] to see if POTC would be a possibity for score. Disappointed, I didn't see it there!! Instead, they have FINDING NEMO, THE MISSING, and this COLD MOUNTIAN movie...IS THAT NOT SICK??  I was close to tears!!! Tell me you cannot believe that!!  I am telling you, if pirates does not even get nominated for music, I WILL FIND WHOEVER MAKES THESE OSCAR DECISIONS AND PERSONALLY AND PAINFULLY MAKE THEM HEAR THIS AWESOME SOUNDTRACK UNTIL THEY GET IT THROUGH THEIR FAT AND UGLY HEADS THAT PIRATES RULES ALL!!!! *breathes* <br />Like I said...there's no REAL soundtrack that as can match the Pirate's.
0385504209|4.0|Short chapters with an action movie styled pace that push the reader forward at a breakneck pace.  This constant hurried pace is both the stories greatest strength and its greatest weakness.  The plot is built around a whirling collection of controversial historical \\"facts\\" like the relationship of Mary Magdalene and Jesus, Gnostic gospels, and the Holy Grail.  These historical concepts are thrown at the reader at the same blazing speed that a breath taking car chase might be described.  There is no time given for the reader to really think, and again that is also the books greatest strength.  Intellectual, no.  A lot of fun and a quick read, yes.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Shrek is a fun movie. There is no doubt about that. Of course, this doesn't mean it will be appreciated by everyone. Of course kids will enjoy it because they see it as a cartoon and all kids like cartoons. But, I don't think they will understand 1/10 of the humor therein. Shrek is obviously aimed at an older, more mature audience. <br />What makes Shrek fun, however, isn't just the comedic lines-they aren't bad and Shrek even laughs at himself, a pretty good way to draw laughs. It's the twist in the traditional story line. Most fairy tales end when the hero saves the princess, they kiss, get married and live happily ever after. Not so with Shrek. Without spoiling the movie, the saving of the Princess is the half-way point. I guess you could compare this in a contrasting way with Star Wars, Phantom Menace. In Star Wars, the movie gets under way but doesn't really seem to have a direction until our Jedi's decide that young Anakin Skywalker is full of the force. Now, that would be great if they then took him back to Jedi headquarters, but instead, they spend the next 45 minutes of the movie following Anakin's Pod racing. At the same time, they are trying to push the story ahead. The problem here is that they found the 'Princess' of the story but instead of taking him home with them, they sat and watched him race pods for an hour. Sure, the pod racing was cool and all, but what did it have to do with the story? Star Wars got stuck and then had to wrap up the story in about 20 minutes at the end. Shrek, on the other hand, doesn't get stuck. It makes you wonder what is going to happen next when the princess has already been saved. The second half of the movie is all about resolving that. This is a great concept for a film. <br />In my opinion, it was hard to see the film end the way it did. I tried as hard as possible to see the princess as beautiful, but her earlier personality had kind of trashed that. If this princess had been assertive but nice, I wouldn't have caredif she looked like a swine and Shrek married her. However, she didn't have the best personality and attitude and that always has a tendency to ruin someone's looks, however gorgeous they might be on the exterior. In other words, the princess' personality ruined any conviction I had that she was an all around beautiful person. Also, once you find out that she is a shape shifter and you figure out what her secondary shape is, the ending is fairly obvious, though the authors do a decent job of keeping you interested. <br />All in all, I would say Shrek is a fun movie to watch though the twist in the story line makes it difficult for the authors to finish the story because of how non-traditional the story is.
B00005JM9C|5.0|Jessica Alba truly makes this movie.  Raymond, a little 8 year old who she takes under her wing also is a scene stealer.  I saw this 3 times so far and it gets better everytime.  The soundtrack is great but is missing a few key songs from the movie.  Missy Elliot, Tweet, Lil' Romeo and Jadakiss made great appearances and in some cases performances.  Hopefully the DVD will have some deleted scenes because as you will see, some of the scenes could have continued a little bit longer.
0385504209|3.0|wow, talk about a morass of mediocre reviews(this included) in what way is an albino monk assassin stereotypical?, technically he's the opposite of stereotypical.  Regarding the religious validity of this text, let's talk bible post Congress of Nice, where are the Book of Jasher and the texts for the other 9 books that are missing, where's the validity?  But I divulge, I'm the furthest thing from a theologian in the world, believer even.  But I am a writer, and I notice the severe dichotomy between the way we view fiction.  Stephen King isn't blasted when he writes about vampires, ghosts or aliens; yet we seem to attack Mr. Brown for using fiction that is eerily close to the truth.  Whereas King's topics are obviously fiction, Brown's tend to touch very close to an apparently fragile reality.  Remember the book is FICTION...FICTION...not satire...not psuedo history...not even an attempt at validity...pure fiction...so settle down and read a good book...or stick to 'Inspirational Fiction'...you know the kind that says that married couples stay happy forever, don't lose their love, and are united by their 'faith'...and stay out of the mainstream
B000089A07|5.0|Once again Hopkins plays a perfect role as Hannbal The Cannibal Lector.  Best remake ever!!
B00006AULI|5.0|Not since Roman Polanski's Repulsion has a psychological or, in this case, psychiatric masterpiece come down the pike. Session 9 is brilliant on all fronts but most appealing to me was the journey, initially gentle and subtle, we take with the characters into the old deserted mental hospital and on to the horrors we all knew existed and remain still.

B000024D4R|5.0|Pink Floyd's Animals (1977) is one of the best and most underrated albums in rock history. It may require several listens to uncover its subtlety and brilliance but the rewards are great. The album includes three sprawling masterpieces (Pigs, Dogs, and Sheep) sandwiched between two short acoustic pieces (Pigs on the Wing, pts 1 and 2). One of the songs, 'Dogs', burns intensely for 17 minutes and elevates only to leave the listener crushed. And then there's the march of 'Pigs'...this is angst so focused its threatening! The next song is 'Sheep', which, dare I say, is not baaaaaad. <br />What is too bad that this album is perceived by many to be an attack on capitalism (just look at the hundreds of other Amazon reviews on the album), but on a further look it does not seem to be so (even though that may be what the lyricist Roger Waters intended):<br />&quot;Animals represents Waters' view of the avarice in modern society that divides people, creating the harsh, cold, uncaring environment in which he feels we live. His Orwellian world is broken down into three basic types: pigs (those who have and hold control with a self-consumed greed); dogs (who aspire to &quot;pig status&quot; and forsake everything and everyone in order to gain it); and sheep (the mindless masses who quietly accept all that is thrust upon them). Though a knee-jerk reaction is to view this work as a statement against capitalism, it would be more accurate to say this as an attack on anti-humanism. The subjects in Roger's lyrics are belittled for their pursuit of self-serving agendas at the expense of all else.&quot; -- Phil Snyder<br />If anything, its an attack on the mixed-economy system. How else would 'pigs' and 'dogs' breed? Anyway, whatever the lyricists intentions were, this is just plainly masterful music.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Right off the bat...<br />To all of you suck holes that gave this album 1, 2 or 3 stars, you are plain brain dead.<br />To all of you \\"musician\\" out their bitching about sound quality, production, song writing and / or comparing this to Maiden of the past (i.e. Powerslave or Fear of the Dark), I'd like to ask you one simple question?<br />WHERE ARE YOUR F'CKING PLATINUM ALBUMS???? Bunch of jackasses.<br />Listen, just go buy the album. Don't expect Powerslave, Seventh Son or a Blaze ear stuff... you know why? IT'S A NEW ALBUM. I guarantee if you listen to this with no pre-conceived notion, you will like it.<br />Yea... their sound has evolved, their song writing has evolved and the band in general has evolved.<br />THIS IS A GOOD THING. I don't, and never will, want a new Maiden album that sounds like one of their past. They have progressed and continue to be one of the best heavy metal rock bands ever.<br />Another pint of bitter....
B0000DJZA5|1.0|Rolling Stone called (Let It Be's--the real Let It Be's, that is) The Long and Winding Road &quot;a lavish (and frankly emotional) epitaph for the Beatles&quot;. It was their last hit single, and it ends, very appropriately, with &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot;. (For those of you too young to remember, &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; became, upon the Beatles's &quot;invasion&quot; of America, instantly a catch phrase, especially among comedians making fun--good-naturedly, let's hope--of the Beatles and among Beatles detractors.) As an epitaph for the Beatles, the &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; would seem to refer to  the &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; refrain in the Beatles's first hit single, She Loves You. First hit single? Yes, first in the United States--released November 1964 on Swan Records (which is a story in itself)--, but fourth in England. It's fitting, then, that the other bookend (The Long and Winding Road, that is) was never released as a single in England. <br />What has any of this to do with Naked? Let's answer a more fundamental question first: Was the Beatles's success disproportionate to their true artistic worth? Of course: nobody is THAT good. This disparity, however, is of historical significance (unlike the--much greater--disparity between, say, Britney Spears's success and her true artistic worth or that of many others I might name--I'm not trying to pick on Britney). The Beatles were the first British pop act to break open the American market, and as events fortuitously unfolded in an unlikely manner (you couldn't make this story up), they became more than a pop group; they became a sociological phenomenon....I could go on about this--it's fascinating--, but let's cut to the chase: the history of the Beatles is not a slate to be rewritten upon (let what's done be done) nor is the Beatles's recorded legacy a cow to be milked regularly to feed a certain former Beatle's insatiable hunger for money after half of the group has died.
0789723107|5.0|I am in charge of two websites: one for my small business, the other for a professional association.  Both websites will undergo a revamp soon, and I wanted to get smarter about web design.<br />This book, recommended to me by a web designer,is absolutely terrific.  It's clearly written and covers everything I need to know.  Most importantly, Steve really shares his expertise with complete generosity.  <br />Whether you're designing a site, or will use a professional designer, this book is a must-read!
0446310786|4.0|When i read,  I like a book that keeps me wondering, exploring, and guessing. And to me those are the strenghts of this book. The author starts out giving you an review of the family, friends and businesses. Then the author goes to one of the main focuses of the story; the Radley's. Whenever she( Haper Lee, the author) began to talk about the Radley family or about the Boo Radley, who is an important but quiet character, my interest level would go from dull to the level oh... oh... tell me more.<BR>     If i had to rate this book from 1-10, would give it an 7. I would rate it a 7 because thi book kept me interested but but not enough to keep every reader hooked.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I emphatically agree with any and everyone who thought that this was a wonderful cd.  Whereas most of today's artist infuse the old into the new, Alicia Keys goes back, and updates that sound with the heavy bass lines and hip hop feel of today.  The result...genius!  This album displays her talent, potential, and versatility.  She is an example that good music will soon return to the forefront of musical culture...I highly recommend this album to everyone who can appreciate good soul music (in that it represents honesty and sincerity), good music, and intelligent vocal production.  Alicia hit home with this album.
B000068PQ0|4.0|I have a confession to make.  When I started this year, I made a promise to myself that I would not fall mindlessly in love with any freakish avant-garde artsy bands.  I was young.  I was naive.  I thought I could restrain my emotions.<br />Of course, within a few short months, I was taken down by the sonic bliss that is the Flaming Lips.  With a techno bloop here and a subtle baseline there, they had firmly wedged themselves into my subconcious.  They are catchy, intelligent, mellow, and that darned Yoshimi is just too cute to resist.  Let it be known that I have gone as far as to request that my roommate &quot;turns up the Lips.&quot;  <br />So do yourself a favor, and listen to the Lips for at least five hours on a bright Tuesday during finals week.  And for goodness sake, don't let those evil robots eat me.
B000001DYA|5.0|...A lot of people have called Blue Cheer the first heavy metal band and &quot;vincebus Eruptum&quot; the first heavy metal album ever made . And in a way they were . Blue Cheer had albums out before Led Zeppelin ( I dont care what anyone says Zeppelin wasnt heavy metal just some trashy blues band) and Black Sabbath .  Now most reviewers have commented on how loud they were but that just doesnt describe the volume these guys played at ... If you were standing in the &quot;cheap seats&quot; or even out doors it still felt like you had your ear pressed up to one of the speaker cabinets (the volume and projection of the sound was that great)in fact the band's manager reported that at a pratice one day they received noise complaints from ten , yes TEN MILES AWAY! ...now I dont know if that was true , but wouldnt be surprised if it was .(what do you expect? I remember guitarist Leigh Stevens had ten Marshall stacks)<br />As for the album you should find something to like about it as it is one of the best that gets labeled as &quot;acid rock&quot; . But just why shouldnt you buy it? well the thing is that if you want to save money then you should take a look around amazon for the album &quot;vincebus eruptum: outsideinside&quot; . The album &quot;vincebus eruptum: outsideinside&quot; is a much better deal , because when you buy it you get this album and &quot;outsideinside &quot; on one disk ! and it also has a quicktime video of &quot;summertime blues&quot; on it
B00005JLSE|1.0|i hate this movie<BR>there i said it
0385504209|5.0|I finished the Da Vinci Code last night and today took some time reading through many of the other reviews. It's very clear that if you like fast-paced thrillers with plot twists (like me) than you are going to love this book (like me), but if you buy this book because you think it's some non-fiction historical text then you are kidding yourself and you aren't going to like it, so don't buy it or read it.<br />By far my favorite portion of the book is the beginning with its unique setup of the plot. I have to agree with other reviewers that the last third tends to drag just a little, but that's a minor point considering all of the just plain awful mystery/thrillers I've read the past couple of years from prominent authors. I highly recommend this book to those readers which fit the qualities I mentioned above. Also, if you like this book, you may also enjoy Assassins Game.

B0000B3B95|1.0|Every summer we are presented with a big summer blockbuster film. But all too often we are disapointed when the big blockbuster turns out to be simply a big summer bomb. This is one of these unfortunate instances where fame falls short, where a beloved commic book character goes awry.<BR> <BR> The heretofore unknown Eric Bana plays(not very convincingly)emotionally scarred Bruce Bannner who was genetically altered by his crazed scientist father, and therefore as a result of his bottled - up rage turns into the incredible hulk.<br /> Jennifer Connelly plays bruce's girlfriend, Betty Ross. And Nick Nolte plays his mad father. apart from acting that leaves much to be desired, lifeless and unlikable characters this film is a model example of a good idea gone sour, a potentially fine movie terribly done. You must sit through an hour of boredom-inducing diolouge and interaction between Bruce, Betty and their fathers both equally cold-hearted and insane. Plus relive Bruce's excruciatingly painful childhood memories which only come off as irritating and tedious.<br /> Aside from the above stated provocations, I must add another. The Hulk's time on-screen limited, unentertaining and unmoving. The only credit I can possibly give &quot;Hulk&quot; is the long-awaited closing scene. other than that it is a long-long two hours.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I bought my 'Playstation 2' just recently,you don't really need the card,just on those super hard games where you get stuck on a certain level,like 12 or 50,and etc. Just the ones you wouldn't want to repeat,then I'd say get the card,otherwise,save your money.
B000001FGG|4.0|Cream's debut album, \\"Fresh Cream\\", is undoubtedly their greatest album ever, but this epic comes very, very close.  This would be the last album from blues/rock's greatest trio before they called it quits.<BR>The studio disc is very good.  Personally, I'm sick of people rambling on about \\"White Room\\" like it's a masterpiece or something.  It's a good song, but hardly their best.  \\"Sittin' On Top Of The World\\" and \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" are excellent blues songs with Clapton providing some superb licks.  \\"Passing The Time\\" and \\"As You Said\\" are forgotten masterpieces that Cream fans never seem to mention (they also never mention \\"Rollin' And Tumblin'\\" from the debut album, which is hands down their greatest studio song ever).  Both of these songs have a wonderful, haunting atmosphere that I just can't describe.  The warm, Christmas-ey feel on \\"Passing The Time\\" is particulary enthralling, with Jack Bruce giving his best, most emotional vocal performance ever.<BR>\\"Those Were The Days\\" is another great song, but \\"Pressed Rat And Warthog\\" is utterly stupid and the guitar solo on \\"Politician\\" just doesn't go anywhere.  And \\"Deserted Cities Of The Heart\\" is pretty much boring.<BR>But wait!  Then we have the live disc!  This features Clapton at his absolute best.  Everyone knows that he jams his heart out on \\"Crossroads\\", giving new fire and passion to Robert Johnson's blues chestnut.  But even better is the monstrous 17-minute version of \\"Spoonful\\", in which Eric plays perhaps the greatest solo of his life.  I kid you not.  He slowly, carefully builds up the tension until it approaches the 12-minute mark (about 11:50), when he brings it to a grand climax, delivering a frightening tidal wave of notes that just twists your insides in a knot.  It's like an orgasm - slowly building the tension until...WHAM!...that Heavenly climax just seems to come out of nowhere.  It's amazing.  If you ask me, the album is worth having just for that solo alone.<br />Pretty amazing for a band that was only together for two years.
B000002AVF|5.0|Her last album before she went skank, this, along with Butterfly, is her best effort. The album opens with 'Fantasy' a pop song that is more alive than 'Dreamlover'. Unlike the other artists today, this pop song has decent lyrics, a catchy beat and great vocals. The bridge fits right in with the rest of the song, and generally it all manages to flow along well. Yet this song is just a hint of what is to come. 'Underneath the stars' is one of the best songs she's ever done - Mariah has said so herself that she wishes she had released this song as a single. 'Underneath' has a mellow feel to it, and everything fits in, from the instruments, to her harmonies, to what she's singing about - and hey, who doesn't want to be seduced underneath the stars? :P Her voice blends nicely with everything and she only uses her full voice for the bridge and some of her backround vocals. <BR>'One Sweet Day' was obviously one of her biggest hits to date, although I prefer 'breakdown' to it. 'Open Arms' is Mariahs cover for the album - performed well, but quite frankly it's boring and not a highlight on the album. 'Always be my baby' great song, has a light feel to it. 'I am free', another ballad,  pleasant to listen to but not for everyone. 'When I saw you' is great, some awesome lyrics in this song. This is worth a listen as it has Mariah doing her low notes in her 'strong' voice - which we don't hear now at all!  'Long Ago' shows a darker side, and is a complete contrast to 'Always be my baby', yet it fits in well and has a wide range of vocals. 'Melt Away' is my number one Mariah song ever, this has Mariah harmonizing on her own voice and it sounds amazing. Has a desperate feel to it, yet her voice does not overdo itself. 'Forever' has a nice melody and has Mariah singing alone without a backround. 'Daydream' is okay, but I don't really review interludes. 'Looking In' is a nice finish to the album, although her other album enders - 'The Wind' and 'Outside' are better. Overall this isone of her best albums, her voice is outstanding, and there are virtually no fillers - even the interlude is listenable. Worth every cent.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a very well written book. It's very detailed and it's a very easy to comprehend and read. When you read this book you will have a better vision of the women in the 19th century had to live. It also talked about entailment, which means that after the father dies , the next male heir takes over the property and females are not able to inherit.<br />  The novel is not your usual love story because in the beginning of this story the two characters who treat each other as if they were the devil end up falling for each other; although, in the beginning of the story you get a sense of who the characters are going to end up with, except one or two couples. My favorite chapter in this novel is the first chapter because it deals with pride and prejudice, exactly the title of the novel. In the first chapter you see that Darcy has a lot of pride and Elizabeth's prejudice towards Darcy.<br />  I like Jane Austen's use of dramatic irony because we as the readers know what's going to happen before the characters, like as the story goes on we know that Darcy will ended up with Elizabeth by the way they treat each other. I would recommend people of 16 and up to read this book because this novel does not make you want to go to sleep. It makes you want to keep reading.
B00005JM0B|2.0|I fell asleep halfway through the movie.<BR>The action sequences are stretched out too much and is so over the top I could not help but laugh.<BR>The previous two movies were excellent (T1 is in my opinion the best of them all), but this movie should either have been directed by James Cameron or nobody at all. The first Terminator movie back in 1984 was dark, disturbing, violent and amazingly believable. T2 gave us more insight into the story, but T3 seem to ponder from one action sequence to another without any rhyme or reason. The only part in the movie where I actually felt a connection with the other two movies was when Arnold aknowledged that he killed John Connor.<BR>Otherwise I was very disappointed with the movie.
B00005JMFR|5.0|alright here it is short and sweet. the matrix, the first installment of the trilogy, was amazing. it's not gettin' any better than that. reloaded lost all the philosophical wonder and replaced it with a lot of explosions, but don't be mistaken, they're very nice explosions. finally, revolutions comes very close indeed to the first one. the matrix: 10 reloaded: 8 revolutions: 9.5 there ya have, just thought i'd throw in my two cents
B000002HMH|1.0|Y'know, a lot of people give credit to metallica saying that they were changing their music to keep up with the times. B.S.<br />I mean seriously, instead of going grunge/alternative, they could've gotten HEAVIER. I mean yeah, Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, Alice in chains were all around at that time...<br />...BUT SO WERE CANNIBAL CORPSE, OBITUARY AND PANTERA!!!!!<br />They should've gotten louder and more evil, not softer and more... mature.<br />Or... they could've just stayed... metallica.<br />I mean, look at slayer. They made some changes, and it was probably good they didn't attempt another reign in blood, but they stayed close to the same. And slayer is, in my opinion a better band(louder, heavier, and more INSANE!)<br />I'm probably gonna get a lot of $h1t for saying this, but if they wanted to do slower songs... why not just do an album with songs like ONE? Start out slow, speed up toward the end, make a @#$!in' epic!
0553213105|4.0|My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy's marriage proposal. It amazed me how she was still able to say yes after she was insulted in every way possible especially after disliking him so much in the beginning of the novel.<br /> This book is appropriate for anyone who is able to appreciate well-written literature. Anyone would enjoy reading this book, from teenagers to adults.<br /> One literary device I appreciated was epigram, which is a brief, clever, and usually memorable statement. An example of this would be \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in wants of a wife\\" which is found on the first page of the novel. The entire novel was based on this quote. Mrs. Bennet wanted to get all five of her daughters married before her husband died.<br /> I liked the novel. I found Elizabeth's romance with Darcy intriguing. It was interesting how in the beginning she rejected his proposal and disliked him, and at the end she marries him.
0060537639|1.0|Gavin Menzies' 1421: The Year China Discovered America is the most ridiculous book I have ever read. Its claims are so implausible and the supporting evidence so facile, I can't believe that even Mr. Menzies thinks true what he contends. I think the book and the hoopla surrounding it are nothing but a giant practical joke, a literary fraud on a par with Orson's Wells radio broadcast about a Martian invasion. Mr. Menzies...is a former nuclear submarine skipper... <br />At its core the book is about making money. And that's all there is to it.<br />Shorn of all the tangential supporting \\"evidence\\" ...the foundation of Menzies' argument is that a large fleet of large Chinese...with a large number of crew and, of course, concubines sailed away from China and were at large for two years. When they returned to China, there was a regime change in progress and everything written about the expedition was destroyed.<br />However, mapmakers on the fleet accurately mapped the entire world and it was their maps that enabled Columbus, et. al., to discover the New World.<br />Menzies has not a shred of evidence connecting these maps made by the Chinese with the maps in Europe of from about 1450.  He just assumes a. China was the only country big enough, civilized enough, and nautical enough to have sailed the whole world in the early 1400s (and we know Europeans hadn't done it), b. the maps in Europe were remarkably accurate, and c. therefore the Europeans discovered America and sailed around the world thanks to Chinese maps. <br />It is too tedious to refute piece by piece all Menzies' evidence. What is plain is that his method is simply to pile up as much of it as he can. And that's what makes the evidence and the thesis suspect: not merely suspect, ridiculous!<br />As I said in the beginning I suspect Menzies is just pulling our legs. The book is, admittedly, a work in progress. In the hardcover version, Menzies promises that the forthcoming paperback edition will correct all the mistakes in the hardcover edition that have come to light. I suspect that such corrections will double the size of the paperback. Then he'll need to correct the paperback version. And so on, forever. A responsible author (and publisher) tries to get it right the first time. In this case, though, sales figures are what matters. Shame on William Morrow for letting this Englishman carry his con job to the States.

B00005KFUN|5.0|Muse is the best band in the world, there  is not even a close second.  Muse is so far ahead of what every one else is doing its crazy.  OoS, Absolution, and showbiz are the three greatest albums to come out in a five year span since the beatles.  Absolution is the best album of all time and that is a fact.  OoS is in the top 5.  Matt Bellamy is a genius never seen before on this planet.  If god could sing he would sound like Matt.  The only person that comes close to his brilliance is Jason &quot;spaceman&quot; Pierce.  If I couldn't listen to Muse I wouldn't listen to music at all.  Just about everything else is a waste of studio time and money.  American music sucks other than The White stripes, Elliot Smith, Bill Ricchini, and the Pernice Brothers.  Listening to Absolution and thinking nothing can sound as good except for the next Muse album that will be the peak of music in its whole existence.

B0000A36J1|5.0|at those afraid to read the books . . . I LOVED reading them 30 years ago (geeze, was it really that long ago?) when I was 19 years old and reread them many times over the years.  When my son was 7 years old (he's now 17) I read them to him; we spent a whole Saturday reading the last chapters because he couldn't wait to see how it ended up!  We've seen all the movies and loved them as well.  The movies are a dream come true to all of us who discovered Tolkien in college in the early/mid-70's.  The books are beautifully written and if you enjoy reading, by all means read them!  If not, you are fortunate to be born into a time when you can watch the movie and learn all about middle earth.  Enjoy!
0553573403|5.0|Let's see, where to begin? This book has everything!!! George R.R. Martin outdoes himself with this first book in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.<br />  The prologue begins with a major foreshadowing event, though the characters in it have little to do with the later storyline, so don't get too attached. The event is important, however.<br />  We then focus our attentions to Winterfell, home of Eddard Stark, his wife Lady Catelyn Tully Stark, eldest son Robb, son Bran, son Rickon, daughter Sansa, daughter Arya, and bastard-born son Jon Snow, as well as their many castellans and servants. Again, there is a major foreshadowing event when Jon persuades Lord Eddard to let each child, including himself, keep a direwolf.<br />  From there on out, it's all action, action, action! Lord Eddard goes to the King to give counsel, Lady Catelyn goes to the Eyrie and her sister with a captive, young Bran is thrown off a tower and crippled in both legs, and an unbelievable, unplanned execution takes place.<br />  The book is filled with characters you love, and some, such as Tyrion Lannister, you hate to love. There is plenty of deceit, death, and fights to keep even the stingiest fantasy lover hooked.<br />  I read this book on a family campout, and (unbeknownst to my parents, of course!) snuck into the camp's lighted bathroom and read all night, fininshing the next morning by the campfire. It took me all night with its hearty 700 pages, but it is certainly worth the wait.<br />  Besides, once you're inside Winterfell, you won't want out anyway!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney did an amazing job on this CD! A hundred times better then her last album Britney, this album begins to show us she isn't just some blonde pop tart that hasn't any flavor. I love her album and especially the songs I've Got That(Boom Boom), Toxic, and Everytime. Britney really drew me back as a fan with this album, it's diffently something worth buying...
1881273156|5.0|This book is great.  The title does not do it justice.  It is a very sound book and the principles can work miracles in your marriage if you apply them.  We read the book out loud together and learned so much about each others needs that we did not know, even after almost 30 yrs. of marriage.  Would have been great to read it when we were young, but better late than never!
0385486804|4.0|Why would a talented and gifted young man walk away from his life of promise and lead the life of a penniless wanderer? Jon Krakauer, the nature/travel journalist, takes on this question in the story of Chris McCandless, who after two years of coast-to-coast travel, was found dead in the Alaskan wildreness.<br />Krakauer retraces McCandless's steps from his childhood to his days at Emory and uncovers a smart, compassionate young man who revelled in the works of Tolstoy, Jack London, and other figures who advocated a simple self-sufficient existence, turning away from money, government, etc.  He interviews several people that Chris, &quot;Alex Supertramp&quot; as he calls himself, met in his hitch hiking travels and discusses his journal writings.  I came upon this book after reading Krakauer's newest book, Under the Banner of Heaven.  I appreciated Krakauer's style of being in the story as an author/journalist, but keeping the story in its purest form.<br />Krakauer first encountered this story after McCandless's death in 1992.  He wrote a feature story in Outside magazine, but was very interested in McCandless, so he decided to research the events more.  This book is the further research.  He provides some insight and answers some of the questions with his own experiences as a mountaineer and outdoor-lover.

0385504209|1.0|When I got to the fourth line of the first chapter and read &quot;hand-frescoed walls&quot; I knew I was in trouble at the hands of a very careless writer. How else would the walls be frescoed? By feet, robots?<br />We find totally wooden characters, ludicrous cliff-hanger plot twists, lumpen exposition, red herrings not worthy of the worst of Agatha Christie, and puzzles which could be solved by an intelligent seven year old. And just when, during this long night, did anyone get the chance to go to the bathroom?<br />Why, you might ask, did I bother going on? Well, it was at least more interesting than the in-flight shopping catalogue in the seat pocket in front of me on my 6 hour flight yesterday.<br />The majority of raving, enthusiastic reviews that I read here leave me deeply gloomy about the intelligence of the reading public.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Although Richard Linklater has become the latter day saint of overintellectualization, I've always felt that he's earned a pass because at least he's got the courage to go this route in the first place.   Few others in the film industry would even dream of.... Woops.      Come to think of it, this film could have just as easily been called \\"Dreaming Life', but that's actually the point.  The word 'dream' can be both a noun and a verb. This film, in a way, takes off from the first scene in Slacker, made over ten years before this one, where Linklater blah blahs about this dream that he just had on the bus.  And then he starts to realize that maybe THEN he was awake, and NOW he's dreaming.  With all this undergraduate philosophy flying around, you'd think it would be a bunch of hooey.  On the contrary, I think Linklater is doing this for the fun of it.
0812550706|3.0|Card is certainly gifted in his imagination.  Unfortunately, you have to make your way through some very heavy-handed prose and cookie-cutter characters before you can start enjoying the story.  Once you get beyond that, however, the story is truly captivating, and you can even suspend your disbelief that even super-genius children would behave in such a way.  Beware, if you're a sci-fi fan, it will get you hooked, especially since the following books, Card begins to show a little more finess in his writing style.
0393057658|5.0|This book is almost impossible to put down. Billy Beane's belief of how to build a team is a glimmer of hope for anyone who is a fan of small-market ball.<br />This book provides a very interesting look behind the scenes of a big league club, and why the A's can't afford to maintain the status quo. Even if you aren't a baseball fan this book will grab your attention, because in the end it isn't so much about baseball as it about bucking trends and taking a risk on what you believe in.
038533348X|5.0|This was the first Vonnegut book I ever read, and it's still perhaps my favorite.  His unique genius truly shines in this novel as you are pulled along most willingly through the realm of both the impossible and unthinkable.  Each character is vivid and lives on in your mind well after you've put the book down.  Of course, actually putting the book down is a challenge.  Even when you've finished, you'll want to read it again from end to beginning and look for hidden messages, because you know your own imagination is not nearly vast enough to have captured the seemingly endless facets of this story.  Don't die before you read Cat's Cradle, because this is at least one more thing you need to do before you've led a full life.
6302891272|3.0|I am a brilliant, but hallucinating student from Nagoya International School who tends to become enamored with pretty blonde young women in the Polanski Macbeth. But because I was drifting off to sleep while the Polanski version was shown, I will offer my sage observation on Kurosawa's Throne of Blood. The film intrigued me with its unusual style. The monochromatic scenes clearly illustrate the malicious atmosphere. Despite the black and white, the blood was just as obvious. The story has been successfully transplanted from Scotland to medieval Japan and tells the downfall of an ambitious warlord. The scenes are mainly shot from a low position which stresses the fact of Japanese Hierarchy. Asaji (Lady Macbeth) seems to be emotionless, this is accentuated by her thick white makeup reminiscent of Noh theater. However, Kurosawa destroy the idea of the Samurai's Bushidou, the way of the warrior. Washizu, (Macbeth) is a proud Samurai but gets destroyed by Asaji's murderous intentions. All his warriors eventually rebel as he gets assassinated by his men. The witches are converted to Mononoke, who is an evil spirit in Japanese. It is also significant that Kumonosujyo means Coweb castle and the Mononoke was spinning thread because Washizu gets caught in a web which eventually leads to his death just as a fly entrapped by a spider. From my perspective, the Throne of Blood is deep. Kurosawa was able to capture the main points of Macbeth as well as absorbing the highlights of the setting. However, if you are a Shakespearean buff, the film lacks the rich language, but this is compensated for by the eerie atmosphere created by Kurosawa.
B000002A3T|5.0|This is one of the most underrated albums in the Pink Floyd catalog.  David Gilmour's voice is the best I've heard it and his guitar work is phenomenal.  I've never heard someone play with such emotion on a guitar.
B000002ADT|5.0|I didn't know a thing about jazz before buying this CD recently.  Everyone said this is *the* definitive jazz album from Miles and his talented peers.  Why is this album so universally loved and accepted as possibly the best jazz album of all time?  Here are a few reasons: The band improvised all of the music based on rough sketches laid out by Miles.  The improvisation and spontaneity brought out the best in each artist.  The music is truly a creative masterpiece that works on several levels.  Hard core jazz critics may criticize me for this, but you can listen to this as background music while you're doing anything else.  Heck, it even makes folding laundry a very enjoyable experience.  Or, you can sit in the dark and focus on the music, allowing it to consume you.  No matter how I listen to this music, I truly enjoy the experience.<br />I took a chance on this album and on jazz in general.  Needless to say, I am glad that I did.  Kind of Blue should be the cornerstone of any jazz collection.  Now my current problem is that I suspect any other jazz album will pale in comparison to this pinnicle of jazz.  However, Miles and his band have opened the door for me to a whole new world of music.  For that I am grateful.

B0000TB050|3.0|This was a major disappointment & irritation thanks to the whacked pseudo-artsy ideas of some photographers.  It seems like a full 50% of screen time is wasted on bringing it home time and time again just how large, grand, and populous the crowd is.  Frankly, I don't care about the damned crowd, but the editors don't seem to trust viewers with an attention span longer than a split second, for the cameras constantly treat us to scintillating views of Edge's ass when Bono is doing something that looks like it might be interesting farther down the stage.  I will never find out most of the things that looked potentially interesting that Bono may have been doing thanks to Edge's butt, the same shot of Larry's pained profile, and the same joyously frenetic dude in the audience that I didn't care to see in the first place. Also, since we are paying for a *DVD* viewing and not a live in Ireland concert viewing, why so many long shots from the nosebleed section?  Is that for the you-are-there feeling? I'd rather have the you-are-onstage-with-them feeling since it is, after all, a DVD, and they can do that sort of thing with the wonders of modern science.<br />After the halfway mark we are in awe of some *extreme* close-ups of Bono's dental work, another sight I could live without.  The cameramen also seem to come from the Brownie Camera Skool of Photography where the cardinal rule is to put the guy's head smack in the center of the frame, ensuring we get gobs of dead white space and cut off all of the other more interesting parts of performer's bodies.<br />But the music of course gets 7 stars, making this review an average of 3 stars.

B000063DHK|2.0|Iron Maiden is loved by metal heads growing up in the 80s, in almost the same way that Sabbath was loved by metal heads growing up in the 70s.  But at least Sabbath didn't completely rip off any band before them the way Maiden does.  The Maiden boys obviously listened to every Uriah Heep and Deep Purple album released in the 70s. (Listen to Uriah Heep's DEMON AND WIZARDS and MAGICIAN'S BIRTHDAY, both of which came out a good 10 years before Maiden made it.)  And this live album cannot live up to Deep Purple's MADE IN JAPAN.  Do yourself a favor, and skip this for Heep and Purple, both of who did it earlier and better.

B000002UAX|5.0|As a long-time Beatle fan since 1964, it's difficult to find fault with the WHITE ALBUM, probably their greatest collection of songs ever released. And yet, whoever edited the song selection on their albums back then was probably never thinking ahead 30 or 40 years, not realizing they'd still be so popular with successive generations. The Beatles recorded so many great songs and were so popular that they didn't need to put their best-selling singles on their albums to help sell them, like most recording artists did. It was a practice almost unheard of for anyone else. (Can you imagine anyone doing that today?) So that when the WHITE ALBUM was released in 1968, they didn't need to include their great best-selling single, &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; or its fantastic B side, &quot;Revolution.&quot;  They could omit their '68 single &quot;Lady Madonna.&quot; They could also leave out &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot;, the great Lennon track recorded that year, or McCartney's &quot;All Together Now,&quot; or Harrison's &quot;It's All Too Much.&quot;  The last 3 tracks were included on the YELLOW SUBMARINE soundtrack album, and because that's mostly ignored today, today's CD buyer doesn't get to hear them.  And &quot;Hey Jude&quot; gets lost on PAST MASTERS VOL. 2, which hardly anyone hears. And buyers of the WHITE ALBUM only get the slowed-down version of &quot;Revolution&quot; instead of the superior single version. What a shame. Original  Beatle fans bought both albums AND singles, of course, but today's CD buyer gets gypped out of those tracks. What could have been omitted from the WHITE ALBUM to include those 6 mentioned tracks?  How about the Ono/Lennon collage &quot;Revolution 9&quot; for starters?  Couldn't he be persuaded to include it on TWO VIRGINS instead?  And &quot;Honey Pie&quot; could have been dropped, along with Ringo's &quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot; and maybe George's &quot;Long Long Long.&quot;  Tell me, lovers of the WHITE ALBUM, wouldn't you trade &quot;Revolution #9,&quot; &quot;Revolution (slow version)&quot; &quot;Honey Pie,&quot; &quot;Don't Pass Me By,&quot; and &quot;Long Long Long&quot;  for &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; &quot;Revolution (fast version)&quot;, &quot;Hey Bulldog,&quot; &quot;Lady Madonna,&quot; &quot;All Too Much&quot; and &quot;All Together Now.&quot; ??  I know I would in a minute.  Still, even with that bit of poor editing judgement, the rest is brilliant.  When you can get tracks like &quot;Yer Blues,&quot; &quot;Back in the USSR,&quot; &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun,&quot; &quot;Blackbird,&quot; &quot;Birthday,&quot; &quot;Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey&quot; all on one CD, well, show me a band around today (including the Strokes, White Stripes, REM, U-2, Metallica, or anyone) with that kind of pure talent and variety.

B000000NN4|5.0|One reviewer here stated that Vangelis is comparable with Mozart and Beethoven and that he is the greatest composer of the 20th century. I cannot quite agree.  Vangelis' composing does not have the degree of sophistication and refinement that the music of Mozart and Beethoven possesses and also the music of the best contemporary \\"classical\\" composers, such as Stockhausen and Boulez, just to name two (the former is also one of the most important pioneers of electronic music, see for example his Gesang der Juenglinge (1956) and his Kontakte (1960), and has created awe-inspiring synth music as well, such as Oktophonie (1991) - all those works are available at stockhausendotorg). <br />Vangelis' composing in Albedo 0.39 at times - though not always - seems a bit coarse, abrupt and when it comes to changing keys, simplistic (there should be more modulation involved) and a tad too obvious (arguably, the often maligned but in my view also great Chariots of Fire, for example, is more mature in that respect). However, his craft of composing is sufficiently impressive such that in connection with his truly awesome musical inspiration, the sheer power of his sonic imagination, his innovative and soulful use of synthesizer timbres that also convincingly adapts these to the diverse development stages of a given track, and his astonishing mastery of a great variety of styles, Albedo 0.39 becomes a fantastic and rewarding musical experience. The combination of above virtues also clearly makes Vangelis one of the greatest electronic musicians.<br />Moreover, the sometimes found simpleness of presentation of musical ideas (there is enough satisfying complexity as well) by Vangelis in Albedo 0.39, rather than routinely being just simplistic, often seems to be the result of a superior musical mind that knows that appropriate simpleness may be useful to achieve a powerful emotional effect.  The abrupt transitions in the music and the few sudden - even slightly naive - outbursts of climactic, glorious or triumphant tone (on occasion they seem to symbolize moments of star birth) can be remarkable in their power, and sometimes the sudden transitions in the music appear to be sheer genius, such as in the track Alpha.<br />In this track of moderate tempo Vangelis paints boldly with broad brush strokes, presenting the original theme and counterthemes to it in varied and inspired ways, with the variations either dropping in suddenly or - towards the end - smoothly developing from the previous material. The large-scale build-up of this 6-minute-piece, easily going from a quiet, delicate \\"ticking clock\\" atmosphere to a glorious, free-flowing climax, is simply astonishing. The build-up is able to sustain unerring, powerful directionality over the very diverse stages, a directionality that is also aided by the seamless integration of the solidly driving rock rhythm into the tension of development.<br />As pointed out by others, the range of music on Albedo 0.39 is huge. You get quality synth-pop (Pulstar; I love those  chords ferociously slashing through the music), jamming jazz-rock (Main Sequence), fast-paced and exciting power-rock where the thematic/melodic lines chase with high speed (Nucleogenesis 1 and 2), the above somewhat ballad-like Alpha, and a few quiet pieces that partially show Eastern timbral and melodic influences (especially Freefall).<br />I agree with many reviewers here that Albedo 0.39 is a most important and impressive work of electronic music. And highly enjoyable to!<br />Two more points:<br />1. Vangelis' playing of drums and percussion, though maybe not wizzard-hand virtuosic, is musically just awesome. Always the right and amazing accents.<br />2. Two passages in Albedo 0.39 sound eerily similar to two highly characteristic and very unique passages in  Bruckner symphonies, in # 3 (1889 version) and in # 6 (1881). Compare Pulstar 2'52\\" to 3'10\\" with 11'08\\" to 11'28\\" in the Karajan recording of Bruckner Symphony 3, 1st movement andNucleogenesis Part I 5'13\\" to 5'36\\" with 13'26\\" to 13'52\\" in the Karajan recording of Bruckner Symphony 6, 1st movement (the magical soft treatment of the main theme in horns and trumpets leading to the final climax of the coda; the Karajan recordings of these symphonies are the ones to get).--Are these striking similarities pure coincidence?
0385504209|3.0|I realize that with over a 1000 reviews for this book that mine probably won't actually get read. If you've read the book- or plan to- please take note that all the \\"bad guys\\" are disabled. Filled with words like \\"crippled\\" and \\"outcast\\" its so demeaning, I am a person with a disability and I found myself insulted and squirming with the horrible rhetoric and descriptions of having a physical difference. However you feel about the political, religious or feminist nature of this book- it really is just another blockbuster the perpuates that people with disabilities, can't handle there situation and are so emotionally vurnerable that they fall prey to evil, or are just plain diabolitcally evil to begin with. In the end- it is all caused by the selfish anger, greediness, and misguided faith of people with disabilities! How narrow minded can you be. Just think for a moment if the villians were jews, or black, or gay, or substitute another group- its like we've time traveled back to a Peter Lorre type character, hunched over and lurching in the bushes. I worry that the popularity of this book will brush over its fundemental problem, I hope a few people will stop, and think about how damaging this type of genre stereotyping is to people who are disabled This type of dressed up pulp fiction needs to come up with a little more complex character development. We've surpassed the days when its okay to paint the disabled person, who, unhappy with his lot in life, becomes either the ever faithful assistant (yes master, mea copa) to an able bodied genius, thankful for the crumbs tossed to him or the eccentric \\"cripple\\" academic whose secret plot is to take over the world. It worked for Dickens, Hugo, H.G.Wells and Marvel, leave that to the comic books- and give the world of disability a break and join us in the 21st century- you have a powerful medium to make a difference in the world. Use it for good and not to continue this blatant \\"ablism\\" that separates people, and excludes people from equal treatment in society.ople from equal treatment in society.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Ingenious construction that plays backwards like a parallel universe version of Groundhog Day. GHD was the story of a man locked in a world that had no memory, each day starting at zero and where he is held prisoner even if he is the only truly free agent. Memento turns this idea inside out so that the main character himself  has to relive each day anew, standing still as the world moves around him. In one he is the focus of change as others are the unchanging scenery - his world externally resets - while in the other he remains the same as the others develop and transform before our eyes - his world internally resets. In GHD imprisonment is physical (he can't get away from the town) with time the only tool: the lack of physical consequences for his actions is comic. In Memento imprisonment is in time with the physical the only tool (his photos, notes and tattoos): the lack of psychological consequence for his thoughts is tragic. In GHD the central character learns to use the world to his advantage and his journey ends when he is ready for acceptance (he goes through the seven stages of loss). In memento the world learns to use him to its advantage and his journey continues when he refuses acceptance - Teddy's speech at the end.

But, just like other &quot;greatest hits!&quot; albums of other artists it has no transition or composition qualities. Part of the art is how the CD is put together. How the songs work with each other, like a well written english papaer. If you want my advise, stick to the classic albums.

B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two Towers Special DVD extended version overrides its fabulous predecessor The Fellowship of the Ring, clocking in 223 minutes with 43 minutes worth of extra footage ranging from light moments after the spectacular Helm's Deep Battle, the Ents' triumph at Isengard to a crucial part on Faramir and his motivations. This is a comprehensive journey into the WETA workshop, production phases and audio commentaries from the crew itself. Fans will enjoy the snippets of how Gollum is brought to life by Andy Serkis and the creation of Fangorn Forest and Rohan. The Two Towers is an exhilarating fantasia that marks the heart of the classic trilogy with interwoven themes of friendship, loyalty and love. The battles are stupendous and grave with dazzling special effects - and with the release of the DVD extended version, it is set to create another miracle again with its Elvish spell.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|There was a time, not long ago, when film scores existed only in limited form on LPs that were misnamed for they contained only reprsentative parts of the music for a film.  Today, the CD has eased that problem to a certain extent.  Still, many soundtrack albums are unable to present a full musical score, unless of course they are offered in multi-disc sets, which is not a bad idea.  The bad news about Howard Shore's soundtrack recording for \\"The Lord of the Rings:  The Return of the King\\" is that like the previous \\"Ring\\" CDs it is hardly the full score.  The problem here has been further complicated by the fact that Shore has added new music to the earlier films that has yet to appear in any recording.  The absence, so far, of a full recording is sadder yet because it is a phenomenal, film and musical triumph.  Howard Shore has done something that no other film composer has ever done.  He has devoted his full focus to a single film production that has spanned over four years...and is yet to be fully completed.  No doubt there will be new music for the extended version of \\"Return of the King.\\"  The current soundtrack is wonderful, and the score with the film is even better.  Shore brings us through  epic batttles, timeless love stories, to the very edge of doom, and home again to the Shire.  By use of themes that have been added to the earlier films, we now see the full scope of Shore's musical vision.  The key, new theme in \\"Return of the King\\" is the Gondor theme, but it is not really new.  It has appeared in the first film, the extended DVD, during the Council of Elrond and briefly for an added scene for Boromir in the second, again the extended DVD.  It is a grand flourish representing the best elements of the Stewards of Gondor and the new king.  In this recording, it appears in several scenes and forms, but is particularly effective as it underscores the warning fires from Gondor to Edoras.  There is so much more to be admired and enjoyed here that it would take a sequal review to complete.  If \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is given just due, it will be counted as one of the greatest film projects ever done.  Howard Shore's music was no small part of that achievement.  It is a masterpiece. Bravo, indeed! The soundtrack album is well produced and nicely packaged by Warner's.  But one hopes that soon we will see a multi-disc recording of the full score.  It is well worth waiting for.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|So I have decided to review this cd which i have been lucky enough to stumble upon after getting into Mars Volta. After I heard one Armed Scissor, I was sold. I got the cd and am now completely stunned. I came on here shocked to see that this cd did not have an average rating of 5 stars. I have decided to breakdown the cd song by song. I will be as honest as possible and won't act like those annoying fans who give every song atleast a 9 out of 10. For these scores, 100 means perfect absolutely nothing wrong about it. These scores will be out of 100 obviously.<br />ArcArsenal - a brilliant opening song for the cd. It lets you know how powerful this cd really is. At first i wasn't sure about it, but 5 minutes after i heard the song it was stuck in my head. It made me think twice about my first judgements. Overall score - 83/100<br />Patern Against User - an excellent song indeed. The song has something special about it. The way it flows or something. i can't put my finger on it, but it is just unique. I enjoy this song a lot. Overall score - 85/100<br />One Armed Scissor - i've already said, this song is just fantastic. The lyrics are great and the chorus is just undescribeable. One of the highlights of the cd in my opinion. Overall score - 89/100<br />Sleepwalk Capsules - this song drives me insane. One of those very catchy songs that wasn't really meant to be catchy. I think this song is very overlooked. Overall score - 82/100<br />Invalid litter Dept. - ... wow. The first time i heard it, i said 'outstanding'. This feeling lasted every time i heard it until just today when i saw the video and found out what all of the lyrics meant. And once the video ended, i couldn't say anything. I was stunned. The lyrics finally made perfect sense and spoke to me in ways i never knew words could. This is quite possibly in my top 3 songs of all time. And i am tough to please. Overall score - 97/100<br />Mannequin republic - This took a while to grow on me. It is a good song. Notone of my favorites from the cd, but still great. overall score - 80/100<br />Enfilade - Excellent. The chorus just screams at you (frieght, freight train coming). ANother song that didn't hit me at first listen. Overall score - 84/100<br />rolodex propaganda - crazy. What an odd combination. Somehow it happens to work quite well. This is the strangest song on the cd. But it's good. Overall score - 78/100<br />Quarantined - another highlight of the d. Starts with the sound of a storm and goes into the song. I love the chorus. Overall score - 88/100<br />Cosmonaut - the last of the high energy power songs that you will hear by ATDI. You really have to hear it. I can't explain how it sounds. But its a great song! Overall score - 85/100<br />Non-Zero Possibility - a slow yet haunting song that ends the cd very nicely. It has a piano in the backround that makes the whole song sound more touching. Overall score - 86/100<br />I judged tough. I didn't want to be like the people who say every song is perfect. There is not one song that is perfect. Actually, this is the cd that has taught me that. I don't know why. Anyways, enough rambling.<br />Relationship of Command may be ATDI's last cd, but atleast they ended their careers together on their best work. It is a brilliant cd that should not go overlooked. One of the best cds that i own. I also find it strange that people would call this emo. I really don't find any of their songs from any cd to be heavily emo. Emo music does not have incredible lyrics like this.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|There was a time, not long ago, when film scores existed only in limited form on LPs that were misnamed for they contained only reprsentative parts of the music for a film.  Today, the CD has eased that problem to a certain extent.  Still, many soudtrack albums are unable to present a full musical score, unless of course they are offered in multi-disc sets, which is not a bad idea.  The bad news about Howard Shore's soundtrack recording for &quot;The Lord of the Rings:  The Return of the King&quot; is that like the previous &quot;Ring&quot; CDs it is hardly the full score.  The problem here has been further complicated by the fact that Shore has added new music to the earlier films that has yet to appear in any recording.  The absence, so far, of a full recording is sadder yet because it is a phenomenal, film and musical triumph.  Howard Shore has done something that no other film composer has ever done.  He has devoted his full focuse to a single film production that has spanned over four years...and is yet to be fully completed.  No doubt there will be new music for the extended version of &quot;Return of the King.&quot;  The current soundtrack is wonderful, and the score with the film is even better.  Shore brings us through  epic batttles, timeless love stories, and to the very edge of doom, and home again to the Shire.  By use of themes that have been added to the earlier films, we now see the full scope of Shore's musical vision.

0553213105|5.0|Chapter 12 is my favorite chapter because it talks about what happens around the lives of the family, like when Elizabeth is alone with her sister, and her mother is in another place. The appropriate age for this book is 15 years up because it has words that are difficult to pronounce and comprehend.<br />The literacy device, which l most appreciate, is characteristic because it is the way to know more about the character. This book l like because it is well written and lets you know about how entailing affected the family in those days, which means the women could not inherit property only the male or brother of them. As a consequence the daughters marry someone they don't like so their husbands could inherit the property.
B00004Z459|5.0|They are my favorite group, and this album really shows they have talent. Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda have a really great voice, the music is amazing and really cool! The person who hates them, FOCK YOU!!!!!!

0385486804|5.0|Krakauer tells the fascinating story of a young man, from a well-off family, who hitchhiked alone into the Alaskan wilderness and turned up dead. It is a fascinating story, and one that Krakauer tells well. His prose is informative and flows well. He has a good sense of story. This is an amazing book--and I recommend you pick it up and read it.

B0000DZ3IG|3.0|&quot;Love actually&quot; is a great christmas movie and gives you that feeling of happiness and joy, after you leave the movie theater. Don´t you agree? The soundtrack is a almost a &quot;character&quot; in this movie.I really don´t understand why the tracklist of the CD is different in some parts of the globe.<br />The CD released in US has only 14 tracks, but the CD released here in Brazil, and also in some parts of Europe comes with 18 tracks. So if you liked the movie, buy the import! The US CD does not include the hilarious &quot;Christmas is all around&quot;, of &quot;Billy Mack&quot;, which is the soul of this movie. The US CD also lacks the instrumental tracks, by Craig Armstrong (&quot;Glasgow love theme&quot; and &quot;PM´s love theme). And where´s the great track &quot;All I want for christmas is you&quot;, by Olivia Olson?<br />Anyway, the soundtrack is great and recommended for this holiday season. &quot;Jump (for my love)&quot; is a funny song and reminds me of that scene of Hugh Grant dancing. The Sugarbabes track &quot;Too lost in you&quot; is also cool, as well as the new track of Texas, &quot;I´ll see it through&quot;. Joni Mitchell´s &quot;Both sides now&quot; is beautiful and powerful. The cover of &quot;all you need is love&quot; is not as good as the original version of the song, but really pleases me, because of the gospel chorus.<br />&quot;Love actually&quot; is a good soundtrack. Buy now!
0800129806|2.0|this one follows into the love triangle of King Arthur, Lancelot and Lady Guinevere....not much exciting really..although there are some good moments and the passion can be put off to the side as dry and not great also..Gere, Connery and Ormond have their moments but the story itself from Willaim Nicholson is silly, but Camelot is beautiful...dry, I say..NOTE: look closely at the part where Gere is being knighted as one of them...you'll see a familiar face if your a Buffy or Angel fan, Alexis Denisof is one of the knights of the round table..dont miss it
B0000AI44Q|5.0|The CD quickly captivated me with its simple raw melodies (electric with Crazy Horse), and touching heartfelt story. The DVD blew me away with its full length acoustic version of the story.<br />Here we have Neil Young at the top of his form. Serious and sincere, yet also light and hopeful. It is the BEST expression of Young in the 30+ years I've been a fan. It has elements of Long May You Run, Zuma, Rust Never Sleeps, Tonight's The Night and Harvest, but combined into a whole that is near perfect. All of these references are to the 70's... thats when Young was fleshing out his various guises. Over the decades since I've found his electric stuff too jagged and the acoustic too sappy. This is neither. It is the work of a mature and very talented songwriter, musician (some great notes here), singer (some of his best singing), and performer (well, not over, produced).<br />What I was most surprised by was the inclusion of the DVD. This acoustic set really compliments and balances the electric CD. It shows Young's light touch and generosity. And while I'm no longer any kind of Bleeding Heart I like the story and find it a cause for celebration.... of our sad, distorted, and tenuous Land Of the Free.
B00006CXSS|5.0|At first I wasn't expecting much from an HBO mini-series, even though Stephen Speilberg and Tom Hanks were writers for the show. Anyways I went ahead and bought the set and was completely hooked from the very first episode!<br />So much intense action and incredibly emotional situations make this by far the best WWII show I have ever seen. This series follows Easy Company (one of the most famous companies) from the start of the war, to the finish. With accounts and stories from the war heroes themselves, it makes for an incredible series you'll want to watch over and over again. I've watched the complete set twice now, and still loved every second of it. And just as a side note: much of the same equipment and props that were used in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; were used in this series. However, Band of Brothers used ten times as much pyrotechnics for effects than Saving Private Ryan did. In fact, by episode three, they had already exceeded the total amount in which they used in Saving Private Ryan.<br />This is a must have for any WWII buff or not. A great depiction of what the heroes of our country went through for us.
