B009NY43NY|5.0|I think Mrs. Harris did a great job ending this long ride. I love this story. I think who Sookie ends up with is readable and sweet.
B001GKJ2DO|3.0|I gave this movie as a gift to a friend who loved it when she saw it in the theater.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The predictions have been fairly accurate. Doesnt drain the battery and keep bugging with notifications like other weather apps in the market.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book had mystery, family dysfunction, and a little bit of legal intrigue. Don't use what I write here to determine whether you read it or not--I'm not a writer.
B006M4F67A|4.0|The app installed quickly and properly. The game loads well. I enjoy the selection this game offers. Overall I'm pleased.
B0019FOC5E|3.0|I gave this soundtrack as a gift to a friend who loved it when she saw the movie in the theater.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I can't believe I invested in reading 13 books in order for it to end this way!<br /><br />You don't expect happily ever after with a series about vampires, but to switch gears after 13 books to this crappy wrap up is not only unimaginative , but disgusting.<br /><br />I would have been on board more with her ending up with Quinn than this ending!<br /><br />So disappointed, and I will agree that it felt as if someone other than the original author wrote the book.<br /><br />Poorly written. Wish I could wash the bad taste out of mouth from this!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|like tbhis very much, have only used it for a few games but will continue to have fun with it
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story an found many of the characters both relatable and interesting. While at times the story may seem sad it is always punctuated by some humorous or even oddly heartfelt turn of events. In all, this is the story of a world seen through the eyes of a comically delusional man that sets out on his own quixotic journey to reclaim the life he has before the &#34;bad place&#34; and perhaps find his silver lining.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|This was a great purchase for those of us that want to pretend that the &#34;prequel&#34;  movies were never made. No longer do you have to worry about moving those 3 abominations out of the way in order to get to A new hope, Empire strikes back, and Return of the Jedi.
B009AMANH4|4.0|Movie had a lot more violence than I expected but it was pretty accurate from a historical point.  We really enjoyed it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|this game is decent... lots of hidden object scenes... just a bit too short.... I will stick to G5 games though.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Before I read this story I anticipated it to be a more detailed counterpart of the movie adaption. However as I read I was blown away by the often gritty details of the story. The thread Yann Martel spins is both familiar and unique at the same time. At face value it is merely another survival story, but below the surface it is a multithreaded veil consisting expansive intricacies laced with dual meanings and universal truths that are reminiscent of Hemingway's &#34;Old Man and the Sea&#34;. All in all this is a very entertaining, yet intellectually engaging read about life, survival, and God.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|Lets face it, this is the poor mans Rolex Daytona. It has great functionality, keeps perfect time (quartz), and looks great. Its a little bulkier than its pricier cousin and the band doesnt have that smooth finish that the Rolex does, but, you really couldnt ask for more for a nice good looking chronograph...which functions flawlessly by the way. If your looking for top end luxury...keep looking but if you want a great watch under a hundred bucks. This is the way to go.
1603429999|5.0|Very complete and easy to understand and learn at any level knitter. It will always be a great book to reference for the ages.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I'm a personal trainer and this book really allowed me to understand why my clients will work out very regularly and intensely and still struggle with weight loss. It's not just about steering clear of carbs, it's about eliminating the foods that spike your insulin levels the most--namely, WHEAT! I am now better prepared to help my clients toward their goals.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I first fell in love with this game on my son's DS.  If it weren't for the ads and the security flags and the occasional score reset, it would be perfect!
B001O5LVPI|5.0|What can I say?! I LOVE THSI  MOVIE!<br /><br />I'm crazy fan of stitch and I had to have this movie in my movie collection!
B00CKKLOGC|5.0|Charlie Parker With Strings is one of my favorite jazz albums of all time. Joshua Redman's current album is on par with Parker's classic set produced by Norman Granz of Jazz at the Philharmonic fame. Song selection is a good mix of standards and new compositions. The quartet led by Redman (sax) and featuring Brad Mehldau (piano), Brian Blade (drums) and Larry Grenadier (bass) is backed by a string orchestra.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Cool&amp;fun...like it excelent graphics good control responce,a little too indepth on  weppons a n d armor upgrades n what not but over all cool
B0087ITBPC|5.0|This movie had the perfect blend of humor and poignancy. The scene in the hotel was fabulous and believable.I would recommend it to every mother who has a son!
B008B68IV8|5.0|I just love Ghoulia so when I saw her in the store I had to buy it even though I had swore I was not going to buy anymore MH dolls till I got paid again. So much for that idea she is lovely and probably my favorite version from looking online. Her make up looks great and love her outfit. All my other MH dolls I paid around 25 bucks for so getting her for about 10 was a scream! I wish she had a doll stand and her hair is not as pictured but oh well. I still love her! Yes, they are for me. My daughter is 21 this month. She can blow her own check on MH dolls for herself. =)
B005IQZB14|5.0|Loved every minute reading about Cheryl. Glad her life grew into something so special. Did she and her siblings find each other again. I hope so. She is a strong and awesome person. I would love to have the fearlessness to have done this.
B002XBVQKW|4.0|Earned four stars for clever lyrics. Quality of picture and audio was excellent. Using Amazon Prime to access was very easy.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Someone yanked the USB cable out of my Kindle Touch and the part that goes into the device got bent. It wouldn't work after that. I found this replacement on Amazon. It works just fine, is nice and long, and the price is good. And as usual, it came quickly!
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|My 10 year old son spent $4.99 of his own money on the \\"Pile O' Monkey Money\\" add on.  They took his money, but nothing happened.  He never received the fake money money in the App.  I see no way to get it to load, or to get any help.  I really would like to get my son's money back.  He learned the hard way about internet scams I guess.  He's really disappointed.
B0091REZMW|5.0|fun. engaging. I really enjoy the whole &quot;clue&quot; feeling. will keep playing. maybe upgrade. but very slow to install. one of the better ones I have come across.
B005X5XIL0|4.0|My mother would like this. She is 97 and likes to listen to music. His voice helps to calm her
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game it blew my mind when I played it creeper's skeleton's zombie's and spider's herobrine ended dragon zombiepigman awesome.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|The was a quinesntial Tarantino movie Lots of graphic violence and gratuitous sex from start to finish. Would watch it again.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Got this app on a whim, and it's actually a lot of fun.there are several free pics to choose from, and I think you can buy more if you want to spend money. the thing I like about this app is that I can choose for each picture how hard I want it to be depending on how much time I have. You can choose the number of pieces,  and even whether you want to be able to turn the pieces to make it even more difficult to figure out where they go. The only drawback for this app is that it's too easy to hit the advertisement pane right next to the pieces. So I'm constantly accidentally opening to download another app. But, if you just hit the back button, it takes you right back to where you were. All in all I highly recommend it for people who like jigsaw puzzles.
193700788X|5.0|I was very worried when I started reading this book because of how many bad reviews it had gotten; however, I was pleasantly surprised. The book ended exactly how I wanted it to and the plot twist was pretty good. I honestly didn't see the plot twist coming, so that was good. Overall, I really liked it. Maybe it wasn't stellar or what some people were looking for, but I definitely enjoyed it and I couldn't put it down!
0679809015|5.0|Love that it's a board book.  Grandson likes seeing what's under each flap. I would recommend this to young children
B004JN1D2I|5.0|An enjoyable diversion from the chaos of our own times. Great details of the life and environment of the time fictional or otherwise. Well worth the effort.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|One of the best series on TV.  Scyfy messed up belly not showing it at a good time and replacing it with junk.<br /><br />The background are fabulous and the acting superb
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Outstanding book. Well written. Great plot with lots of action but also good character development. Really fast read and makes me want to start the next one.
B006964E8S|4.0|A really interesting and relatable set of characters and a great storyline. I'm definitely hooked on Baldacci's books after reading this
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I sense the author is getting tired of the story and I'm frustrated that the book concludes while leaving so many stories untold and incomplete.
B0097K21YW|4.0|This is a great challenging game with great graphics. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys exciting game play.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Great spirit on every song infused with depth, soul and brightness.  Beautiful voice and wonderful lyrics like little novellas.  Bravo!
B009G41CG2|5.0|Mahjong is one of my favorite pastime games.  I recommend this game to my friends it makes you think while you are having fun.
B009POHHPS|4.0|Great history about how the DC universe shifted to the new 52, and as always, the history is all about the dark knight. Must read item. Remember also to read the flashpoint side histories of Batman and Superman
B001EQ5ZJK|3.0|The book seemed geared more for parenting; be a great book for parents.<br />Even so, I really did enjoy the author's theory on cells, and the universal analogy between one singular cell and the universe. There are some parts of the book that will really make you think!<br />I would most definitely recommend any parent to read this book, for some valuable parenting information.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I've had this watch for five months now, and wear it almost all the time (taking it off for showers or *really* dirty work).  The mainspring remains fully wound without any additional effort on my part.  It seems to gain about one minute per month - which is well within expected parameters for a mechanical watch.<br /><br />I do wish it had a &#34;hack&#34; feature where the second hand could be set to 00 seconds, but alas, it does not.  Not really a biggie, but I knew it going in.  I'm still 100% happy with my Seiko watch!
1583334386|5.0|A lot of books on this topic tell you what your brain does when it's going through a situation that requires willpower, but offer little in the way of practical ways around the problem. This book offers both enjoyable storytelling to illustrate what the problems are AND practical how-tos to get around them.<br /><br />A quick example: in the first chapter, McGonigal explains how your brain tends to default to short-term benefits over long-term ones, which is why you often eat the cookie in front of you even though your long-term goal is to lose weight. She thoroughly explains why we've evolved to impulsively choose the short-term benefit, but then she gives both reflective exercises (\\"which is the harder option? Why is it harder? How do you feel when you think about going the hard route?\\") and practical strategies for how to stop giving in to the short term benefit when the long-term one is really what you want. In this case, it's keeping a log of when you're tempted (developing self-awareness) and practicing meditation for a few minutes a day (which gets your brain in the habit of pulling focus back to a single goal).<br /><br />The other ten chapters similarly lay out a single willpower challenge, a few reflective exercises to help you identify where your personal challenges lie, and a few practical how-to tools to change your behavior. I think it's the combination of reflective exercises and practical ones that makes the difference for me in this book - a lot of books offer one or the other, which means you either spend a lot of time thinking about how great it would be if you could just magically make your brain better (if it's all reflection) or you get overwhelmed with a giant to-do list that doesn't seem immediately applicable to your situation (if it's all how-to tips).<br /><br />McGonical lays out why the problem occurs, encourages you to apply that understanding to your own personal willpower challenge, and gives usable actions to overcome that challenge.It's a great structure for a book of this type, and I've found (as her students did) that when you actually sit down with pen and paper and put her exercises to use, it's made a notable difference in my ability to get through the impulse to procrastinate online (the personal willpower challenge I chose for my first foray into this book) and instead focus on long-term projects over time.<br /><br />One caveat: I read the book through the first time without putting anything into practice, and while it was interesting, I definitely got MUCH more out of it when I did the exercises. I found there were sections I'd dismissed as not that important that turned out to be much more influential when I actually used them. I also recommend taking McGonigal's advice in the introductory chapter: don't try to put every chapter to use all at once. It was much more enjoyable to take a chapter per week (or so) and add to those habits over time - less stressful than trying to make all the changes at once, and a minor enough impact on my usual routine that I hardly noticed the effort. The results, however - very noticeable.<br /><br />Highly recommended. It's a light read and would be a perfectly enjoyable book to read just to learn about the brain science, but the true benefit is in the exercises.<br /><br />I will say that occasionally her writing style gets a little cutesy for my taste, but I didn't buy it for literary style, I bought it for practical use, and it absolutely delivered on that front.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|This is a great book and I love the online version it is so easy to find the verse you are looking for and the helps and maps are great.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I gave this 4 stars because I knew going into it that this was only half of a book. Had I not known that a dance with dragons completed the story told in this book I would've hated it because the pov's in this book are clearly the JV team, where a dance with dragons contains the pov's of the varsity team.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|it's a lot of fun, and very easy to pick up and play for a few minutes.<br /><br />it looks great for a tablet game although there isn't too much depth besides flying the same endless stage repeatedly, but with variation in enemies and scenery.<br /><br />but heck, you're iron man. and that's awesome.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|hey everyone.. ton cruise rocks this,, you got to order it... enjoy alec baldwin and russell brand as well rock on
B005K17RU0|2.0|Loved the simple easy to use app until the update. just wanted a quick look not a fully detailed weatherman report.wish I could undo the update.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I bought this for my wife who received a kindle had for Christmas. It protects the kindle nicely and will turn it off when closed. Leather hols up well and the elastic strap keeps it secured nicely. I would recommend in a heartbeat and getting it from amazon as opposed to a big box store.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|honestly if you need a reason to buy a bowie album, you're obviously musically deprived. this is an amazing album, and a great return from seclusion. every song on the album shows hints of the different time periods of his career, so whether you're a new fan or an age-old fan, there's something for everyone to enjoy.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Good looking watch. Perfect to use at work, as I am outside in the sun and heat 12 plus daily. Band or watch do not heat up on you..
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I absolutely love Doctor Who and the 10th Doctor is my favorite, so now having his screwdriver is amazing! It works perfectly!
B00479SVBU|4.0|Not complaining by any means. I've had these fm transmitter's before and I've never heard one that came in perfect. But this is a solid 4 star buy, super easy set up, very convenient with all the options they give you to actually play the music. I've only used my phone so far, maybe the quality will be butter if I try the USB or SD card approach. Great little gadget.
B004FOOQV6|5.0|You need a good app that can convert measurements over several different systems. This product is a welcome addition to your references and is complete in areas of coverage and simplicity of use.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|After watching the movie, I can understand why Ms. Lawrence is considered a great actress.  The details are described well enough by others so I want go into that.  Regardless, this is a great movie and I can recommend it for anyone that is a mid teenager or older.
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|I was hoping to see this at the theater but missed it, so I watched the DVD at home. I really enjoyed the movie. I haven't seen these actors before (and if I have I don't remember them) and I thought they did a pretty good job. That little girl was adorable. The heroine was put in an impossible position and I thought it resembled \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\" with Julia Roberts, but it was a different theme and setting. The movie was more chick flick than thriller, but it had it's moments that made me a bit jumpy. The chemistry between them seemed real enough. I would watch this again.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Bought this product for my girlfriend because her Android phone would not hold a charge and she has multiple iPads that need charging when out at events. The device fit nicely into her purse and was easy to use. She was able to get multiple charges before the device itself needed to be charged. I would recommend this device to anyone.
B008602KQI|4.0|Well cast, well acted. A faithful interpretation of the book. Worth watching whether you've read the books or not. Some bad CGI, but a good film overall.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was great.  I didn't want it to stop.  Looking forward to th  next room.  The game can be finished in a few hours and it is worth not using the clues unless you are really stuck. I highly recommend this game to anyone who lives puzzles
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Avsimple easy to play jewel swap game. I was a little unsure about how well it work since it is free and all,  but it is definitely better than any other free game app!
1936608898|5.0|This book was recommended by my MD. A great informational book. Loved it and have purchased several more for friends and family!
0761163808|5.0|Wow.  I ordered this for a friend who will be taking her dream safari in a few months.  The (literally) moving pictures and Dan Kainen's words about this art form.  THEN, the written portraits of a safari and the history of safari by Carol Kaufmann.  Heart stopping.  Thank you, authors.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This was a wonderfully raw,  gritty telling of the author's  early life and the innermost thoughts behind his actions all along the way. It's one of those books that once you start reading, you don't want to put down until you know the whole story.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|I love scary movies. This movie does not even belong in the horror genre. It was an hour and a half of boredom. I should have taken a nap instead.
0307352153|5.0|A fascinating topic, humorously presented in a non-tedious way, without academic jargon.  You will meet yourself and people you know, and come away with a better insight into what makes us &#34;tick.&#34;
B008XG1X18|5.0|Every one who likes to think about the world and what they like to do in it will love pinterest...I love to craft, make quilts, make jewelry, collect quotes, remrember places I have been and places I would like to go...Lots of recipes and exercises for weight loss or just plain GOOD FOOD...You get to know people and recognize who's pins you choose to look at ...They always let you know when someone is interested in the same things that you are...The Hubby is even hooked...They have all kinds of woodworking, redoing old furniture, painting tricks, gardening...He has made me 5 things off of the site since he started looking at it...Fun for everyone who has a little (NOT) time to waste...
B004XANKVO|5.0|I travel a lot and got this bag for my trips. It holds a lot. I had 2 laptops an iPad and all the cords and cables, plus notebooks and everything else I needed. It all fit easily. I really like how the pockets are set up as it is easy to get things out at security and on the plane.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this one again.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Sometimes when I want to sit and relax this gamepullsthrough to allow my mind calm. It's nice in that it's not so impossible that I can't finish a game. And should you run into a a tough spot it allows a shuffle!
B008JF8O9M|1.0|The Kindle Fire can't print using any of the print apps, even Best Buy couldn't get it to print at their store.
B00B2TUKI0|4.0|Liked it but expected more - was somewhat country sounding more than jaz blues but would recommend it to anyone who likes her
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|I have been thinking about this movie for some time.  While talking about with friends the other night I decided it was time to<br />to add it to my collection.  Great Movie!
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie is good but the books are better..read them if you get a chance. The movie misses a lot of the details....The DVD itself was in good shape no problems.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who asked about this amazing book. B-) &lt;3
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was getting a little tired of &#34;the aliens did it&#34; in Mr. King's more recent books.  This was a fabulous story.  Loved, loved the ending.  I found myself procrastinating with things in my personal life in order to get back to reading.  Great characters with a unique story.  Works for me!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Resisted renting this as: (1) read this movie did not do well in box office; (2) reviews not that good on Amazon and (3) Not a Tom Cruise fan BUT I LIKE THIS MOVIE. Decent enough plot with a mystery to be solved. Action fairly even throughout and one kind of action or another. Bad guy, really bad guy which always helps. Date movie?? Could be. Movie with spousal unit?? Could be as limited language and graphic violence. If you like action, this a decent enough movie. Mindless entertainment.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|This is a awesome app. no problems with it, either. it's well worth the $4.00! it helps me remember upcoming bills.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I really love this app! it has awesome effects and most free editing apps don't have very many. the only thing I don't like is that its hard to save pictures to my kindle fire through the app. I have to export it to a different app and then save it through that app. other than that I love it :]
044024613X|5.0|I loved the structure of the book and the story was riveting. I would recommend this book to all who like mysteries and court room drama.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|this book was just like the title Splendid, it made me cry, it made me angry, it made me feel many things. I think I understand the people there a little better. I am not sure it made me like them any more but I do understand them better. I read this book because it was on an assignment for College. But I am glad I did.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I tried twice to watch this movie and I couldn't watch it to the end. This movie was poorly done.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I got Pinterest because family and friends have it. It has great categories to chose to follow. I recommend this app if you are looking for different categories to follow and share.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a fun game. Enjoy it more than most of the similar type of games. Fun little side mini game.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Simple I was an expectant mom to be. My son is 5 mos old now and I still like this film.

B005ES0Z9O|5.0|I had reconstructive foot surgery and had healed to the point where I could begin to wear shoes.  But, no shoes were wide enough or comfortable enough with my swollen foot -- until I found these.  The wider base of these Crocs was perfect for my swollen left surgery foot and - thank goodness - still fit my non-surgery right food.  I have worn them with almost everything over the past few months and they have always been incredibly comfortable.  I have noticed that these Crocs are the perfect footwear on 12-hour non-stop international flights -- everyone's feet swell on those flights!
B00BESLHEA|5.0|Humor easy to watch. Not hard to follow storyline. Thanks Amazon for  enjoyable movie nites with the family. Great job
0634049011|3.0|I got through this, I kept it around whenever I had free time and got through it that way but focusing on this full time is not recommended as it will bore you to do that.<br /><br />My only complaint is lack of explanation. You learn a lot of stuff but there isn't enough reasoning as to why you should or how to connect the theory.<br /><br />Also making diagrams of the neck in all 6 notes? seriously. ain't nobody got time for dat. lol
B006MW3UZW|1.0|Have had nothing but problem downloading this series, down load movies Netflex  with no problem was wasted $19.dollars. Will not down load again.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is so fun, and well-designed like all of the Toca Boca apps (seriously - get them all!).  My kids especially love the features of the Toca Salon 2 - they can curl hair, wash it, dry it, put in accessories and take pictures.  Very cute!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I started playing the trial version of this game and got so into it, I just had to pay the unlock price to get the whole game. It was worth every penny! This game has amazing graphics and an &quot;on the edge of your seat&quot; storyline! I really wish there was a sequel to this game because now that I've finished it, I miss it!
B000093BDX|4.0|I liked all but about 2 or three of the songs but over all it was worth the purchase. This cd makes me think of summer espescially of summers long in the past. Kind of bitter sweet really. It makes me think of good times and care free days of the past but also makes me long for the past.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|Well what can I say... Disappointment.<br />That's what this book was. I really expected so much more.<br />1.sookie to go out with a bang<br />2.so much potential set up from past books just wasted.<br />3.there really was no set storyline it all got a bit boring.<br />4.eric was a hardass Viking fighter. That's why we love him! To send him out by just giving up?! I don't think so. Like seriously was that even the same Eric northman from this series. No!<br /><br />I could go on for hours but were not here to bash the book.<br />Final comments<br /><br />Charlaine Harris as a well established author I hope you are ashamed with your work and just know you have ruined the sookie stack house series.<br /><br />Fans.. If you enjoyed the series but haven't read this one yet THEN DON'T.<br />Honestly your better off not knowing.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Validating for introverts and enlightening for extraverts--and fascinating for everyone. The book gives thought provoking insights into economics, politics, culture, society and individual personalities.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The best of the Batman Trilogy. Even though the Dark Knight had an unforgettable performance by Heath Ledger as The Joker, it was slow at times. This one was full batmobile ahead.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this story, the setting and the dialect.  The author puts you right there with a flood of emotions.  I loved some of the characters, disliked some and found others despicable.  I couldn't put it down.  I can hardly wait for Christina McKenna' s next book.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Having read all the novels and seen all movies I was interested in how this series was going to play out - the producers have done a fantastic job. I am impressed.
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|From episode one to the great music, this series gives you everything. Great special effects, good drama, everything you could hope for and remaining fairly accurate to history.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I thought this was very well written. It was easy to read and gave a good insight to the SEAL role and life.<br /><br />I learned of Chris's death before finishing the book. It was a real blow to find that someone who was so selfless had such a tragic and short life. The positive side of this is Chris died helping someone else. Just like his entire life and my sympathy really goes out to Taya and the kids. They were so patient and giving of themselves in support of Chris's dedication to the USA.<br /><br />Chris I'm sure your standing right there next to God and cracking jokes. Ryan is probably there doing the same.<br /><br />God bless you and your family and a belated thank you for your service.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a little slow starting. But then it was hard to put down. It usually takes me forevrer to read a book, but I used every free second I had to read. I'm waiting for my DVD to come in.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Bought this as a present for a friend who recently got a blu-ray TV station and loves it. Great quality!
B0014DFCMS|5.0|Great movie with a great story line! A must watch by all.  Funny and has a good cast as well!
B000067FP8|5.0|It never gets old.  Gremlins is a film that we grew up watching and I just had to pick up a copy for my husband as a gift.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Pretty fun game. Good time waster. The only annoying thing is the in app purchases!! You don't have to wait a whole day for something to build like other games.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Like that there are easy and then progressively harder games to solve. I also like the hint and shuffle helps.
B0081336FO|5.0|Sherklock Season 2 has great plots. Too bad there are only 3 episodes this season. It gets over really quickly so it's ideal for a tiny weekend marathon.
B0067EKYS6|5.0|Having just finished teaching Gatsby, I went in with very low expectations. However, I thought this new version did a very good job of presenting the Jay Gatsby I know- he is very electric in his love/obsession of/with Daisy. I agree that Daisy, herself, was cut too much slack. I'm not sure why they decided to make her seem reasonable, but other than that, I was pleased with the production. I'm glad we are still interested in keeping The Great Gatsby relevant.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|Purchased on the kindle and our 18 month old has memorized the story. One of my favorites for little ones.
0345803493|5.0|After reading this book I want a Christian.  It was really entertaining and enlightening I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I learnt a few things that I never knew

B000FA675C|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Loved the suspense. Lots of action and cool historical references. Ends really well. I would definitely read more books by this author.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. If only I could play it always. It's a great game to play in your free time
B00005Q66T|5.0|Love it, it takes me back in time and brings back memories and reminds me of why I've  been such a fan of Madonna for so long!!
B001QWBM62|5.0|I own both the H1 and H4n and I love them both. The H4n is a great versatile field recorder. I mainly use it to record audio for live event video such as weddings and speaking engagements. The H4n is a work horse. It has a ton of features and records in a number of different formats. I highly recommend purchasing a \\"furry head\\" wind screen for the unit as the foam wind screen included is not for out door use.<br /><br />Unlike the H1 design that has a hard protective ring around the microphones, the H4n leaves the microphones exposed in order to capture the purest sound possible in live and studio applications. However, be aware that because of the exposed microphone design the external mics are prone to breaking off if the unit is dropped. I had this happen once. If this happens to you, don't worry. I searched the internet and was able to find several Zoom certified service centers within my general area. I called the closest service center, spoke with a repairman and shipped the H4n off and the mic was replaced under warranty; I didn't pay a dime. I had it shipped off and back in 7 days.<br /><br />All in all the H4n is a great field recorder. I mainly use it in 4 channel mode. 4 Chanel mode allows me to record from both external microphones as well as the two XLR inputs at the same time. In some cases I also use a small 4 Channel Behringer field mixer if I have to run more than 2 lavalier microphones. Running straight from the mixer outputs to the H4n works perfectly.<br /><br />I do suggest some accessories when using the H4n. As I said earlier, purchase a \\"furry head\\" wind screen. I use the furry head wind screens every time I record outdoors and they completely eliminate wind noise. I only use 32gb Sandisk SD cards because Sandisk is dependable, I have never ever had one fail in all my years of recording. I record at 48K @ 16bits in .wav format which tends to create a lot of data when at live events so 32gbs is large enough to record over 20hours at that sampling rate. This allows me to keep old audio clips on the card for a while after recording them and is a safety net in case I forget to transfer the audio files along with video when I edit. I also suggest having a DI box on hand in the event you may have to run a line out from someone else's mixer. I have had issues with digital clipping and over saturated sound when running a feed without a DI Box from venue mixers. This has to do with a balance and padding that I am just not going to get into but trust me, a DI box is the simplest and surest fix for these issues. I also suggest getting a small portable mixer in case you have to run more than 2 microphones when at live events. Always be prepared. I use rechargeable Duracell AA batteries and I have never had any issues. Battery life is between 6-8 hours when the unit is left on, and 3-4 hours when left powered on and recording.<br /><br />I do not regret this purchase at all. The H4n is a handy little studio on the go and is very dependable. I highly recommend purchasing one.ing rate.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|Another home run in the series.  Thoroughly enjoy this game and series.  I will continue to play and play and purchase any others in the series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was nothing I expected it to be. I bought this book on accident then forgot about it for a month. Then one day decided to read it and now I'm mad I forgot about it because it was absolutely amazing! As soon as I thought I knew what was going on there would be a twist that made the book even better. You must read this book!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book evoked many emotions. It was sad to realize what happened in  this story had a touch of truth.  It had a good ending. I would probably read more books by this author.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Is love this game, the  graphics are wonderful, a lot of fun to play keeps you involved and interested and worth the money.  It's one of the better apps I've owned got to go play a bit more.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I LIVE THIS APP IT THE BEST APP FOR THOSE WHO LOVE THE KING JAMES VERSION OF THE BIBLE LOVE IT.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Harris is a great storyteller, but she seems to be going through the motions with this book. There is no real story. She  is just wrapping up the story to end the series. Her fans deserve better.
B00362DRNG|5.0|It was great to finally hear Songs like the original version of &#34;Girls on Film&#34;, &#34;Tel Aviv&#34; (with the lyrics) --a much better version in my opinion than the version that appears on the original album --and &#34;To the Shore,&#34; which was deleted from the first U.S. release back in 1983. These songs take you back to the sound that Duran Duran developed before they cut their first album. Duran Duran is a band that is constantly evolving their sound, so to go back and hear what they were doing all those years ago sounds fresh today. At times they almost sound like a different band when you notice all the emphasis they were putting on guitar in some of those earlier songs. Another great bonus is the video clips of the British Tv appearances. Those were great and a rare treat since none of those clips were shown on American Tv or would be available to see today by any other means.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MY 6 YEAR OLD LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!<br />Best purchase I have made on the Kindle. It's wonderful and creative. All kids must try this game just once. They'll be hooked.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|Really loved watching this movie. It wasn't your typical &#34;the government is messed up&#34; type movie. It had some twists and turns and was fun to watch.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A truly touching story that will make you think about your own life and family, your successes and failures and your remaining days.  Recommended for anyone who appreciates a well written engaging tale from an amazing storyteller.  Don't miss this one.
B00362DRQS|5.0|If you ever saw &#34;Arena&#34; but where disappointed by the silliness, this DVD is for you. That is because it contains &#34;as the lights go down&#34; It is an alternate version of &#34;Arena&#34; which contain all the great concert footage preserved without the stupid subplot of a villain trying to take over the concert. One of their best B-sides ever also appears on the Cd, &#34;Secret October.&#34; Another standout is &#34;Faith in this color&#34; a rare instrumental which is almost as good as their classic, Tiger tiger.
B00003CX8N|4.0|great, like all of the people and the plot so go out and get this one and watch it over and over
0345803485|5.0|I couldn't find the books in the stores anywhere and the stores I did, the prices were way to high. I found all them here for a great price.
B00BSBUZT6|1.0|This title clearly says 3 Blu-Ray, yet only one of the disc's is a Blu-Ray Disc. This is a scam at best
B003XOAJ6K|5.0|It was great to see Duran Duran in concert on the bonus DVD, especially during this era. This CD was one of my favorites. It was right up there with Rio. That is until they released the Wedding Album and Astronaut which are now up there with Rio as the three classic Duran Duran Cds that are must haves for any fan. However Big Thing is a close second. There are gems on here like &#34;Palomino&#34;, &#34;too late Marlane&#34;, &#34;Land&#34;, &#34;Lake Shore Driving&#34; and &#34;Drug&#34;. this Cd even has the original version of Drug that did not appear on the first CD. Other great bonuses are spoken word recordings of Simon LeBon's poetry/philosophy and some great remixes. The Eurohouse Mix of &#34;all she wants is&#34; is my favorite of the bunch. Check it out Duran Duran fans. You wont be disappointed.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Easy learning curve, great graphics, gets harder and harder as you progress through the levels. Best of all, nothing to buy once your initial purchase!
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|Ringo at his best.  One of the best All-Star lineups.  It is the complete concert.  Joe Walsh also makes an apperance doing &#34;Rocky Mountain Way&#34;.
B003K16P50|4.0|This book was funny and unique.  The idea behind it about the ridiculousness of politics and bureaucracy was entertaining, I just think it went a little far and should have been a much shorter book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|27 years old and having fun with this app. Hard to get gems but  it's fun to watch your horse and train them. For best results you need to care for your horse at least daily
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I regret buying the album because I only like 3 songs. The rest are just fillers, it's not as good as the hits.<br />I only like songs number 1,2, and 9. Pusher Love Girl, Suit & Tie, and Mirrors.<br />I should have only bought the 3 songs for 99 cents each.
B00BN2CY7G|3.0|This album is a bit different than the older ones.  It is ok, but it will take me some time to get used to.
B00BJS7104|5.0|I am a crazy Tarantino fan! I own most of his movies on DVD, this one lives on my Amazon account, but i just watched it again for the third time.  i would watch it more if i didnt have a young child in the house.  I love the exagerated blood spatter, the carefree attitude of the dentist and the romance of the horse doing tricks at the end.  My parents even liked this one!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Probably great but I am already following too many people and have even picked up a few followers.  Now if I could figure out how to really use Twitter in my daily life (other than following ISS crews and that sort of thing) it might prove useful.  I got on Twitter to keep informed of Smokey Mountain National Park road closings and to promote Groundling! - a 250-page love story of flight when I start pitching it in late May, 2013 as well as Flyers in Spirit (Hangar Flying for Microsoft FSX), EagleFlight (a six short-story children's series) and my seven-novel RomCom series when I start pitching it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|****SPOILER****<br />***GIVE THE BOOK A CHANCE! ***<br /><br />A work of fiction is about the story an author creates and writes, and as a reader you get transported into another world and journey.  If you're reading a story and experience a god complex about the storyline or characters there are 3 solutions:<br />1) Become a writer, or even a fanfic writer.<br />2) Realize that becoming so engrossed and passionate about a book is a good thing, the writer was obviously a good job to get you so hooked.<br />3) Continue reading or not, but realize how to be mature about how you express your frustrations.<br /><br />Objectively this is a good last book of a series.  All the negative feedback mainly stems from the fact that people (aptly named Eric Lovers) can't look past the ending and who Sookie ends up with.  Every single person I've seen who's written a passionately negative review tend to mention Eric and being displeased and even angry.  I'm not saying its the best book Charlaine Harris has ever written through its literary execution or plot line, but its definitely not deserving of such intense and harsh criticism.  (By the way, throughout the whole series Eric is hinted in various ways how he isn't the most compatible for Sookie.  Their relationship was primarily sexual and little else)<br /><br />The writing style is different then Harris' previous books but a lot of that is writing in multiple perspectives.  The book and plot line do feel somewhat rushed, but it was a lot of a story to tell and was just not long enough to help with that.  However, Charlaine Harris manages to tie up several loose ends to many of the major and supporting characters, and gives an overall closure to the series while still leaving the storyline in such a way that allows for readers to imagine where she left off.<br /><br />As a side note:  I love all the main characters in the Sookie Stackhouse series, I never put myself into a suitor team and instead just went along for the ride.Sookie's HEA makes sense for who she is and how the previous books slowly led up to it.  The people that are upset and irate should probably just go for reading the typical Romance novels and fairy tales, because obviously those are the people that want the traditional 'And They Lived Happily Ever After' ending.  Charlaine Harris is obviously not that kind of writer, and all her works demonstrate that.  I will continue reading, rereading and recommending Charlaine Harris and all of her books and series, including the Sookie Stackhouse series.
B001USHRCK|5.0|In terms of the cost of Lego sets, this one is a pretty good deal.  Daughter loved all the figures and the extra little things.  The buildings were challenging enough to keep her interested for quite a while.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I wanted to watch this legally and this was a great place to do it. It was a low price, great video quality, fast download and the show was amazing. I will definitely purchase again.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|While this does have a few features that My Alarm Clock doesn't have, they are basically the same and sets up exactly the same way on my Kindle.
B009JBZH54|4.0|got this as a gift. the person really likes it. good quality and fast shipping. its a plus if you are a batman fan
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|My favorite album of the year so far. A great record you can kick back and get totally immersed in.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|enjoyed it very much. still feel tom cruise has the same swagger in all his movies. but yet the movie was very entertaining, and thank you for no (I`ve known you for two seconds sex scenes) some please tell Hollywood  to stop using the same scenarios in the movies. and for GODS sakes when you ladies knock out a villain please pick up his or her weapon!!??
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Technically it works great on the Kindle Fire, but I can find no way to change fonts or font sizes in the Lulu market e-book (Spur of the Moment by Joe Boring, Jr.) I purchased to read on my Kindle.
0071771263|5.0|This is the best overview of what the exam looks like. Not too hard as the Cambridge ones. Most important thing is that you should practice on exam condition. Time yourself. After 5 practice, you should feel more comfortable with the exam.
B007REV4T8|5.0|One of the best action movies  we have watched.  Enjoyed it immensely. Bought DVD for my parents. Couldn't turn away for a moment. Judy Dench was at her best.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It sucks its always freezing and you lose all<br />your points and your bingos. Takes up a lot of your time just to restart the game.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great for a basic alarm clock.  At least now, I won't have to pack one in my backpack or lug around my heavier Vizio tablet (unless I decide to take the Kindle Fire, Vizio, i-Pod, and my Dell Laptop on vacation (which wouldn't be much of a vacation).  At least this one also gives me local weather and with a bit of work, now plays Alaska and Me if I need an alarm clock.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Love how it bounces from character to character. Also side note love how the show does a pretty good job of staying true.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am a gamer to unwind, and I can play this game for an extended period time and not get bored.
0142403873|5.0|My students are completely enthralled by these books. They are refreshingly different and unique. The story line is delightful. Little children always delight in reading tales of small creatures triumphing over or outsmarting large, scary creatures.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Another very easy to set alarm clock for my Kindle (Why should I have to wake up early if I'm on vacation - other than to hit the Continental Breakfast Bar and to get an early start on the day?) but it works great.

B000031XCR|5.0|As I have previously stated, this is an awesome CD.  She has the voice of an angel.  I was so glad when it arrived.  It actually came earlier than anticipated so I was happily surprised.  It was in excellent condition.....
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|While it hasn't arrived yet, I saw it in the theatre with my SO of more than seven years.  We both loved it, but after re-reading the Meaning to the Poem I wrote as the real thing was happening (and also after doing more research) I came to realize that the film was &#34;Hollywooded&#34; quite a bit - including changing the names of the whales.  Still, it was a good movie and definitely deserves a slot on my Autograph Shelf (probably next to Soul Surfer, Chasing Mavericks and Invincible or elsewhere on those shelves).
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It's super addicting and what makes it even better is that it's free! I really like it and it's so easy and fun I can't put down my kindle until I'm done playing it!

B000ITF86E|5.0|Great entertainment and everyone can watch!  You need to go back a few years to find movies you can enjoy, and stick with the legends.

0670014893|5.0|Reread this remarkable novel. Here is my revised review as of 1/10/15.    Once begun, a Delicate Truth cannot be put down. Le Carre continues his descent, like Dante, into ever deeper levels of governmental moral bankruptcy.    His earlier novels tell the long tale of England's \\"secret war\\" versus the USSR, where good ends are pursued though unsavory means -- commitment to an \\"ends justify the means\\" policy. Each of these tales takes place in a fog for the operatives charged with executing policy. That fog is generated not only by the opposition, but by government types more interested in career advancement, avoidance of bad publicity, and just plain nuttiness than in the success of a given mission. Sometimes they are driven by a secret conviction that the other side is right and that England is wrong. The remarkable exception to all this is George Smiley, a hero and human being for the ages, who with his \\"people\\" somehow survives it all, figures all of it out, and eventually triumphs for the Circus over his arch rival, Karla, dreaded and devious head of the Soviet intelligence apparatus. On the English side of things, plans often go wrong, with moral damage to and sometimes the death of the operative charged with carrying out the operation. They also result in heart rending collateral damage to innocents in each operation's path, unanticipated or, worse, known but ignored.    More recently Le Carre has focused on the underbelly of capitalism and its unsavory connections with and domination of government. A Delicate Truth is the most powerful recent example, and a compelling, multi-textured, beautifully written story it is.    As always, government's purposes are imperfectly pursued though officials driven by personal ambition, vulnerable to the lure of private wealth, and animated by a hardened resistance to recognizing what is good and what is evil. Government in this most recent iteration, always suspect in policy in the first place, acts on false or inadequate information and here for very bad purposes indeed. Collateral damage of all kinds ensues, some at the time of a key event three years in the past and more later, all of it tragic.  In the end, all is to be covered up and forgotten. The novel is mostly about that damage in its various forms, how it came about, and why.    Government is portrayed as not only passive in the face of wrongdoing, but as an active, sinister player, promoting it for its own or, in this case, for purely private ends. These, government aims and private purposes, have become, functionally, the same. Government is determined to do whatever it must, and is being instructed or is expected by interfering, controlling monied interests to do whatever it takes, to guard not only their respective secrets, but to cover up their mistakes -- and the connection between them, too, of course -- by any means. One man gradually finds out about the three-year old, terribly botched, badly motivated operation and pursues what happened, determined to get to the bottom of it. But individuals matter not a whit here. The good and the innocents who resist, who cannot go along, who get caught up in it, even peripherally, who cannot turn their backs on what they learn, who think that somehow someone somewhere, if only informed, would hold the corrupt responsible, get rid of them, and correct course, do not fare well.    The message? That government not only does not care any more about doing right and avoiding wrong, and can no longer even tell them apart. The citizens are no longer in charge. Money is. The lesson: all of us can become collateral damage at any moment and, should anyone seek to expose the dark corners of government botches and the connections between private money and government, refusing persuasion of various kinds to refrain from investigating and disclosing them, personal destruction is assured.    Not a pretty picture. But Le Carre does not paint pretty pictures.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Love it I can play all day lol . But how . Do u change the background? But I don't like seeing the boring fish on there lol
0316069434|1.0|I've been reading the Harry Bosch series since it started.  At first, Harry was a flawed but believable character that we respected even if we didn't like him much.  In this latest outing, though, he's morphed through into being truly loathsome - full of distaste for \\"criminals\\" yet blithely breaking laws right and left.  Worst of all, I suspect Connelly really admires his character.  Harry Bosch has always been something of a jerk, but he's turning into a monster, and I think Connelly likes him that way.  I won't be reading any more books in this series.
0061544493|4.0|I loved this book. Went through it in one day because it was so jammed packed with tips. If there's any one person I'm going to take style tips from, it's definitely Victoria Beckham. She always looks amazing and designs her own clothes for crying out loud. And its adorable too how she throws in her own personal feelings on some style choices, for instance the &#34;pants tucked into ankle boots&#34; has never been one of her favorites. Haha the only thing that was confusing was how British slang was used (what we call tank tops in America, they call vests in the UK), but you can't really blame a UK girl for using UK words. Overall, a great book with practical tips and entertaining commentary from a leading style icon. Great book for fashion lovers or Spice Girls fanatics like myself. :)
B007HJ84WS|5.0|Epic Rome movie. I loved it, I like 300 better but this was very good as well. I you like Rome war movies this is for you.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I am not a big indie rock fan but I truly enjoyed this album. Icelandic folk music is the best way I can descirbe it. Her voice is enchanting. It is very sutble but powerful at the same time. Well worth gettin.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|We plan our outings and vacations around this user friendly, easy to use app.  Colorful, accurate, pretty consistent.<br />We use this on our Apple and PC's.
0525952926|4.0|This is the second in a trilogy and I can't wait for number 3.  Characters flow from one generation to another.<br />For me the theme was the evils of all war.  This should be required reading in all high schools and just maybe<br />all involved in politics.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|This guy is amazing, he is a great actor, if you like his kind of movies you will love this one to!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I loved this book. It shows how to live life and the true meaning of each life. I wish that every human on earth would read this and take away the positive message. I will recommend this book to all of my friends
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is large, easy to use, great for those needing reading glasses.  Same one on PC and Apple.  Simple and classic.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I was born in 1952 and never was taught anything about orphan trains.  I thoroughly enjoyed this well written novel. Today is Mother's Day, and I encouraged members of my family to read this one.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Great movie if your into this kind of thing. The price was good and the story lie was not bad at all.
B003XKB0RG|1.0|The title says it all. Obviously, as a piece of work, Faces ranks as one of the groups finest and most ambitious efforts. This makes the Big Break Records remaster all the more heinous. I can't believe HOW LOUD THIS REMASTER IS!!<br />Twice as loud as the excellent remasters of the early era Columbia albums (Open Our Eyes - All'n All). And distortion is audibly present which is just sad.<br /><br />Turns out remastering was handled by Alan Wilson at Western Star, a British Rockabilly and Psychobilly label. A strange, and turns out poor choice indeed.<br /><br />Luckily, there is hope. Get the Blu-spec japanese edition to hear how a real remaster is done. The dynamic range is retained and it sounds fantastic. Unfortunately it's double the price of this edition, but it's a no brainer if you love this music.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Awesome and uplifting music by a woman who speaks her mind like myself.  There's always a sentence in her lyrics that moves me to tears or to joy.  She knows her soul and that's a wonderful thing!!!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|This was probably a more factual account of what went on during those times.  It was a very good story line - very violent - but you couldn't tear yourself away.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|If youve seen the others and liked them then you will like this one too. It was a little weird watching it without Matt Damon but still a good movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great book to read!  It is a romance that is intriguing, touching, and romantic.  i couldn't put it down and I was so sorry when I finished it.  I wanted more of the same.  You will not be disappointed in this book.  You'll be like me waiting for the author to write her next book.
B0035JGYZS|3.0|Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />I just recently finished watching the entire TNG series. I then followed with the movies but I was hesitant to watch this because the previous 3 movies had let me down and I was worried that the last one with TNG cast would do the same. Unfortunately, it did.<br />Most of the reviews here touch on all the things I found wrong with the movie. When coming up to the Data-like body parts, how nobody mentioned Lore did seem like a big oversight. With the time-travel they've experienced in the series, was it not even a consideration that it might be him?<br />Was this the Data-Picard show? This was the last movie and I certainly expected more than just a few lines of dialog from a lot of the main characters of TNG.<br />I was very disappointed that they were trying to make it seem like because there was a clone, the clone should think like the original person and they could predict what each other would do. Really? That far into the future and they haven't figured out that environmental factors are a big deal and no two individuals (cloned or not) will ever turn out the same?<br />There were some good parts to the movie, but not enough to really satisfy me. The one part that I thought was very emotional was Data sacrificing himself to save Picard. Data was my favorite character of the series, and to see him do that was definitely a sobering moment. However, it was semi-disappointing that B-4 started to act like Data at the end, as if he would be replaced that easily.<br />For a non-Trek fan, I could see this movie being enjoyable. But for someone who fell in love with the series, I was expecting a lot more from the last adventure of TNG crew.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I read this book and found it very thought provoking. I just gave a copy to my daughter upon her college graduation.
0439023513|5.0|I loved this book, this series is great. The books have much more info than the movie does but thats how it usually is I guess.
0316228532|1.0|Didn't like the copious swear words, and Rowling didn't seem to like her characters very much - was quite disappointed.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I have enjoyed this game and have e experienced none of the issues noted in the others reviews.  My only critique is that the game instructions/tutorial was easier to access and the game objectives explained more clearly.
B005D6O0LQ|5.0|I just love them!! I even have them in white. The delivery was as expected, no surprises nor delays. Excellent buy!! Just make sure you keep them away from your dogs as they find them very chewable!
0553801473|5.0|The seller I received this from was not honest in it's condition but besides that; it's a GREAT book. If you are in love with this series books or show then of course you will love this book. I m taking my time reading it because the author likes to take his time in writing the next one of the series. Great Book!
B002361MLA|2.0|NO THANKS. I'm curious as to whether its possible for a person to become enlightened overnight and from one awakening, I guess anything's possible either Eckhart Tolle has a very very simple mind or his awakening was little more than a money making idea, I didn't read much as I was turned off quite quickly by his own story and his style of writing, there are books on the subject of mindfulness that are so much more rewarding and don't stink of profit. The beginning reminded me of the controversial book written by James Frey, A million little pieces, all wrapped up neatly with a pretty bow on top.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love all of their books. This one was especially interesting as is solved some previous questions and mysteries. Keep writing, please!
B00899DR40|3.0|Purchased album for my daughter, she loves them and listens to Justin Bieber constantly.  However, I am getting tired of Bieber though.
0345529057|5.0|I love all these books in the series, if you have never read it try it out. You will not be disappointed if your into this kind of reading!!
B0054R6BFM|2.0|Whoa... I can't explain how this hit me. It did, and I don't think I can give it a fair rating because yes it was well written and stuff but it hit so close to home, not what I'm going through specifically but so many people around me are. I'm trying to help them all with everything in me but I just wonder if it will always be enough. Sorry I know this is depressing but it's really how I'm feeling.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent book. Would recommend it. I hadn't figured out the ending until I read it. The book held my attention  to the end.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very good book. Had a hard time putting it down. Would recommend it keeps your attention and not a predictable ending
B008CPZNL6|1.0|I loved this app on my iPhone, so when I got my kindle fire it was one of the first apps I downloaded. Extremely disappointed in the multiple freeze/crashes that make this app more of a chore to use, rather than enjoyable. Will be switching to a more reliable app and saying goodbye to flipboard...<br /><br />UPDATE: I was willing to give this app another chance, and for me it seemed that it was crashing less (though it still froze frequently).  However, for some reason it is now riddled with full-page advertisements interspersed within almost every expanded article. Annoying, and not what I want when reading a news feed. Back to Feedly or some other aggregation app for me.  Sorry, Flipboard, you perpetuated your own downfall here....
B00BHMF578|4.0|suspense and breath holding movie.nice.Ben Afleck's portrayal is not bad. A true story, I have just watch last night  from the tv the real people interviewed. wow imagine what american can really do to help other american. hats off to those who willingly participated to get americans out.
1401937519|5.0|I saw Anita Moorjani on the PBS show with Wayne Dyer a few months ago and was touched by her and her experience. Having read many NDE books, hers is very powerful. Not only is it well written by a very interesting person, whose life evolved through her NDE, it also made me very grateful that she shared her new found and very personal insights.<br />Her recovery from near death and the pure love she has with her immediate family touched me deeply. And the synchronicity in the third part of her book is absolutely amazing (where both Dr. Dyer and Hay House connect with her).<br /><br />Barbara Ramos
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I just love this book, so much so that I'm going to a hard copy to give to my non-Kindle friend. I do not normally fawn over an author, but Setterfield has become a favorite author of mine with just one book! The twist at the end was fantastic - Instant classic for me!
1601251556|4.0|I had a Chessex mat years ago (when they were thicker) and red pens would always stain. Nothing I've used has on this flip-mat has left any trace. GameMastery also makes some very nice pre-drawn area maps with 1\\" grids. I have Ancient Dungeon, Town Square, Haunted Dungeon, Keep maps and they are great for areas characters visit regularly.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|This is a book about a girl called Hazel who has cancer and is depressed. When she meets Augustus her life slowly starts to change for the better. They begin to share love for a book and then they fall in love themselves. But they both have cancer and every minute together is important... The first half of the book is very humorous, the second, however, is rather melancholic and as the story draws to a close you simply feel like you're going to burst into tears immediately. Also some passages are quite beautiful. It's a great love story that doesn't get either emotionless or cutesy, with a slightly melancholic ending that is unusual for this kind of book. - Julia, 13 years old
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|this is part 2 of a two parter. A must have if you're a fan of DC, batman or comics in general.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game! I have it on my phone my Ipad my Ash's slider. But my Kindlefire quit on me after a certain. level. Twice!!! what happened :/
B007N8RULO|4.0|I enjoy playing the game on my Kindle Fire HD. I also play music while playing the game. The only small drawback is that, at times, when I leave the game to go to my Pandora app to rate a song I am listening to, when I come back to the game, I can't open the game. The problem could be Kindle or Pandora or the game.<br /><br />This problem doesn't bother me since the game is still fun to play. For a Free app, it's pretty good.  :-)
B001I45UFC|4.0|This is a very good book.  It has a very good story along with very artistic pictures and Ilustrations among other things.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|New to the Kindle Fire, like the game, easy to use and play. I would recommend for some down time and relaxation
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book had a great flow to it, almost  hypnotizing. The ending was cohesive to the storyline. I felt I knew and understood Pat Peoples. I could empathize with him, root him on, and cheer Eagles!!!!  A real story Bout mental illness and love.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I listened to all her songs on youtube so much that I felt I should buy the CD and now it is much easier to listen to :)
193700788X|5.0|I know there was quite a bit of uproar over the ending to this book but after reading it I am at a bit of a loss. I think a lot of people are complaining that the character of Eric seemed different in this book than he had seemed in previous books. I disagree with this view. I think Eric acted precisely in his character, in that it has always always always been apparent that while he did love Sookie \\"as much as he could\\" his true allegiance was always to him self. Freyda was really a wonderful match for him that he was going to get a lot out of and I think that is why he went, not because he was being forced to. I also believed Sookies assessment of why he made sure she was taken care of was spot on. I had a feeling from the beginning of the books that Sam was who she may end up with and for the naysayers who complain this was an abrubt shift for Sookie they are also wrong. When Sookie and Sam were talking in the very first book she said that even though it was tempting, she didn't want to get involved with Sam because she loved her job and most importantly their friendship meant so much to her that she was not willing to risk losing it. It has been obvious from day one the close bond Sam and Sookie had, and I believed that coming so close to losing him, feeling his heart stop beating, really shifted things in Sookies mind and heart. I believe people are so upset because Sam was never one of the \\"leading men\\" that they were used to thinking of as such hearthrobs. No he is not nearly as hunky as Eric and the story isn't as romantic as her falling again for her first love Bill, or as exciting as the sexy and dangerous Quinn but in the end I believed wholeheartedly those things were not what Sookie really wanted. Her wish for a baby and \\"normal\\" life has been abundantly clear from book 1 and never wavered. While she loved Bill and Eric she was willing to sacrifice some of the things she wanted, such as a family, a husband who could bar b que outside at a picnic duringthe day with her brother and friends, someone who would grow old with her instead of staying young while she aged, but the point is those were sacrifices, things that she really wanted and was going to have to go without because she loved men with whom that life was not possible. Anyone who says this was a departure for Sookie sure hasn't been paying attention to any of her thoughts about these things in the books because she has thought about things like that in almost every one of them. I know some people feel that they are owed some kind of ending that would fit more with what they wanted, Eric perhaps or Bill, but to me, Sookie has seemed like a dear friend who has given me so much enjoyment and happiness, that I feel she deserves happiness and contentment as well. She deserved to love a good man whom she can have everything she wants in life with and Eric was a selfish bastard to try to keep her from it. I am sad that the series ended, but extremely happy with the ending (Other than Claudes part in it, while he had already proven to be terrible I was still dismayed by how he betrayed Sookie and Hunter). I enjoyed it very much, as much as I enjoyed all the other Sookie books, and I look forward to reading what Mrs. Harris writes next because I believe it will be good also.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Since that it made me want to keep reading and reading. I would recommended it to someone who like action books,sprinkled with a dash of romance and comedy.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Its stylish and has enough compartments to hold all my equipment. Definitely a steal for the price. I would recomend to anyone of any skill level
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Like that it can be turned in two direction. Lightweight.Great color selection.Snaps in very tight. haven't had any problems with it coming out or loose.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read a lot of books in the last month but none have shook me to the core like this one. I was expecting a teen love story which it is but it's so much more. It's a story of love,forgiveness, sacrifice, and what we do to shield ourselves from pain and heartache. I would recommend it to anyone. For anyone who works in human services this book should be on your shelf. Finally thank you to colleen Hoover<br />for writing a story that needed to be told. Unfortunately there are stories of sky going on right now that we as a society are oblivious too. Let's stand up together and help those children.that's all.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|If you loved  The Goonies you will love this film too. Good family movie, I  travelled back to the 80's and my 13 year old son  loved it, couldn't stop watching till it was over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing subway surfers! I C<br />could play for hours without getting bored. I would definitely recommend this application to anyone who is looking for a fun and interesting game.
B00CQ23P0M|5.0|First, I think they did a great job at picking the winner of the glee project last season. \\"Ryder\\" is a really good character and he is a wonderful actor. I think keeping Alex aka \\"Unique\\" on the show is just pointless. His character is pointless. He did not have too much of a fan based on the glee project. I think making Unique be the catfish person was kind of dumb. They should of had it be someone else. Other than that, great season. loved it.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|At least for a little bit. As nice as the game looks it's lacking in content. Flying through the same city street, into a tunnel, and then military base. Could have made more levels. While the multiple suits are nice they share the same powers. The only reason to upgrade is more health and score multiplier. Really can't say it's a bad game since I've spent hours playing. The hit box can use some work as I've been crashing into things when I'm sure I dodged. Maybe they could add a side scrolling section, or perhaps a shooting gallery.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|Great movie with excelent material.The quality and sound of this release is awesome. This item must be in your collection.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I am having so much fun playing this game. Learning how to solve the mystery in the game. Please don't hesitate to try to play this game
B007N8RULO|5.0|Love it!  Exciting to play.  Love to compete with friends and try to raise my score.  It is very addictive.
B00004W4UB|5.0|I have always loved the classic brought to the screen in a relate able manner.  This movie really does that for movie.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What  a great book. My whole family has read this book. I hope it gives a real perspective to my daughter that wants to enlist and become a police officer what it is really like at war.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I never expected that this novel about a dystopian world would read like a philosopher's thesis.  Great for both adults and kids alike.
044024613X|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment. All I wanted to do was flip to the last pages to see what happened. The ending was appalling.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I chose the four stars as I felt that it is almost as good as her book &#34;The Forgotten Garden&#34;.<br />The characters are well explained - with many twists and turns.  The ending was quite surprising.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I found this to be a great movie. It has given me a whole new appreciation for those you live with ASD.
B000FC146C|4.0|The book never fails to enthrall its readers with the rich background and lovely characters.  A definite must-read to those who crave a love that defies everything.
0321344758|5.0|Dear UX &#34;Designers&#34;<br /><br />Your opinion doesn't count unless there is science behind it.  Saying you like one color, or a certain workflow doesn't mean squat unless you test it.  This book shows you how to make the best UX and user workflow without massive testing.  It's easy.  It's common sense.  If you follow the guidelines you'll end up with an easy to follow, easy to use website.<br /><br />To the UX designers who think they don't need to test because they know what works, hahahah.  Good luck in your career.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I like this game it has great. graphics. it takes a little. to get used to but once you play it a bit not bad game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book!<br />Super easy read I couldn't put it down. Off to the next book. Hope the movie is just as good.
B0053KWDES|5.0|If you're a devoted iPod user, this will amaze you: It's not so much that you will be able to play your music louder (although you can, of course) but that you will experience a new level of richness and detail in the sound. Really. It also (to my ears, anyway) eliminated some high-end distortion and tinniness. I use it with an iPod Classic (I know, it's old-fashioned, but I carry around a LOT of music commuting to NYC) and use it mostly with Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones. It is definitely a worthwhile $60 upgrade. My only complaint is the six-hour battery life - it means I have to charge the amplifier much more often than I do the iPod, and it's yet another special cable hanging out of my desktop PC. But I'm willing to put up with this inconvenience for the sonic improvement.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|Not one character in the book ever expresses sorrow for a lost spouse, child, parent, pet...? It was a good idea but executed poorly. Overall, a big 'feh.'
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Another good Amazon purchase. Make a handy tool to keep in tool box, tackle box, kitchen drawer, vehicle  or backpack. Small light weight and produces fast very sharp edge . Inexpensive , easy to use would make great gift for anyone.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Cher and Christina are wonderful!!  The movie and soundtrack are most enjoyable. Worth listening to just to chill or to jam
B001QKSWOE|4.0|I was laughing out loud so much my husband begged me to tell him what was so funny. So I read him a few passages and, now that I am done with the book, he is reading it and laughing out loud too. This book is a riot.  Like Evanovich's other books, she comes up with the funniest circumstances and quips.  What an imagination. And Carl, the monkey. What can I say about Carl? And his interaction with Stephanie's family.  Good grief.<br /><br />Get ready to laugh!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|From the soothing ambient music to the smooth transitions, to the movement of the water drops and the simple premise, Quell Reflect does all of the little things correctly. You can easily get into this simple to learn game. At times you want to pull your hair out at some of the more challenging levels, but this game even provides a bonus system that offers hints. The graphics are not flashy, but they are really well done. I really love getting engrossed in playing this game. And the numerous levels make this game worth the price you pay.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I thought I'd have a quick look at this game and 3hours later I'm still saying \\"I'll just play one more game\\" :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is addictively fun its a grate ivestment i cant take my eyes of the screen off the screen
0307341577|4.0|Having read and enjoyed Gone Girl I decided to read Gillian Flynn's back catalog. I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed. This woman can write dark books filled with a lot of twists and turns and very flawed human beings.<br /><br />Libby Day was seven years old when her mother and two sisters were brutally murdered while Libby hid. At the trial she testified that it was her brother Ben who committed the crime and he is serving a life sentence for the crime.<br /><br />It is now 25 years later and Libby is living off the last dregs of the money that had been donated to a trust for her when she was the sole survivor of the massacre. She doesn't work and doesn't know what she is going to do to survive. When a member of the \\"Kill Club\\", a society that is obsessed with true crimes, contacts her she thinks she has found a way to make some easy money. They will pay her to speak at their meetings and buy artifacts associated with her family from her. They also don't believe Ben is guilty. Slowly Libby begins to believe they may be right.<br /><br />The book is told is alternating chapters; the present and the day of the murders. The storylines begin to converge, as Libby gets closer to the truth of that day - the \\"Dark Places\\" she never wanted to revisit.<br /><br />This book is not those who like every thing neat and clean. A lot of the people are very unlikeable; including Libby who is very damaged, as I imagine many of us would be if we witnessed the slaughter of our family. The descriptions of that terrifying night are brutal and graphic.  In the end there isn't really a happy ending either, just a truthful one.<br /><br />Flynn has become my newest author not to miss, although since I have now read all three of her books it's going to be a while for a new one. She really gets into the twisted places in people's head and writes mysteries almost as if they were horror stories, which in some cases they are. So, highly recommended if you like well written tales, but filled with darkness, then this is the book for you.d with darkness, then this is the book for you.
B00BT0ZDF2|3.0|An interesting but slightly confusing film. It is the type of movie that would benefit from a second watch. I had hoped for more twists to the plot which were less obvious.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I'm a first time mom, and in my third trimester.  I find this app helps me keep my mind sharp.  I very much enjoy it, almost every day.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Insightful rendition of an exciting time of change during the War. An eloquent  depiction of the emotional highs and lows as humanity pushes forward despite the heartaches and hardships War brings. One cannot help but stay enthralled as the characters change their perspective on society and expectations while some seek to fulfill dreams and others find new ones.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Nice version of mahjong-I like the layouts and the colors of the tiles.  It's a nice change when I get tired of Random Mahjong.  Easy to figure out and has help buttons if you get stumped.  Works well on my Kindle Fire!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|THIS GAME IS A COMPLETE FAILURE!!! DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY.<br /><br />The game is fun to play, but after hitting level 87, the company decided to improve things but messing everything up. All the buildings and animals tripled, and at least half of the land was no longer usable. So I restarted the game. Thank God I didn't spend any real money on this game. I doubt I will ever risk any real cash with the game, due to all the bugs the game seems to have. The servers have been no operational for most of the Mother's day weekend, and all of Monday now. The need better techs, or equipment. This could be fun if it ever works as it should.<br />So I started over and made it to level 63. More the fool am I. Once again they \\"improved\\" the game and messed things up so bad that all I could was delete the game. There doesn't seem to be any solution for a negative population of 962, without spending real money on a game that only sort of works.<br /><br />The technical teem that like to make \\"improvements\\" should spend more time making it work, and less time screwing the game up. It would have been nice if they could have at least tried to make it work.<br /><br />I have completely deleted the game, twice is way to much time to bother with it again.
B000000H4A|5.0|This is the album that started it all - right after coming out of Mercyful Fate, King Diamond assembled a new band with some of the ex-Fate members, and they came out with this. This music is largely more accessible than Fate's music was, as it is not quite as heavy, and there are none of the Satanic lyrics that Fate was infamous for. Instead, the music is much more theatrical and rather melodic by comparison, and rather than themes of Satanism, the lyrics are based around horror stories (with most of the album being jointed into a single, cohesive story, but the rest being stand-alone compositions). The one thing that is really special is the bass playing of Timi Hansen. He really adds A LOT to this album, just listen to the intro of &#34;Haunted&#34; for a great example. Overall, every song is wonderful, but the greatest song is not even really on the CD: it's the bonus track - &#34;The Lake&#34;. I have no clue why King chose to leave this MONSTER of a song off the album, but what I do know is that it's a great tune and a rarity that should definitely be heard by every King Diamond fan. Pick this album up as soon as possible!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I think this was an awesome book! I really like the action and how they put a group of demigods together to fight. Kind of like the Avengers!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of the best scifi books I've ever read, i've been reading scifi since I was a kid, great plot, very visual in the narrative,<br />plenty of tension, the hero and co-heroes were well developed, and the tension between the heroes and the protagonist were synonymous with the present day techno-economic realities although this occurs in the future.<br />Legendary Saxophonist Wayne Shorter recommended this book in an interview, I imagine it sold several thousand because of his plug. Can't wait for the next book from Cline.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It's pretty cool but next time like Don't make the water Animals and ice animals so hard to get other than that it's SWEET!!!
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I never realized how important saying no is.  Now I have freed up my time to take cafe of what is important to my family.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|its an ok game. if you have trouble loading it then delete a lot of games and then it works. it is fun to play.
1476734941|5.0|I had seen part of the television show on PBS a few weeks earlier and a lot of what he said made sense.  I was looking for a way to diet and get myself in better shape not just from a weight standpoint but get blood preasure and fat levels in line.  This diet wasn't to hard for me to get into and when you begin to realize just how much food 600 calories is when eating greens it's not really all that bad.  Been loosing weight, slow but steady.  First goal to get under 200 then down to 185 where i would like to stay.
B000NV55RY|5.0|I saw this movie at a walk in years ago and I mean years ago. The movie is not scary but is a spoof at horror movies in my opinion. Fearless has the typical vampire stuff but has a humor air to it which makes it entertaining. If you are looking for a &#34;Freddie&#34; movie this is not for you but if you are looking for a movie to entertain you and give you some laughs Fearless is your movie. Kinda hoakie but good enough to purchase.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This product was excellent and a nice free download to pass the time away, and good for not being bored.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This sounded quite captivating (well guess it would since I read it before).  Realized a bit into it that it was a re-read, but continued reading and it held my attention right up till the end.  Sometimes it seemed my mind was as confused as the subjects was as there was a lot of repetition which I guess there would be if a person had absolutely no recall of most of their past life and got just bits and pieces which went away after a night of sleeping.  It certainly is not a book where you think you know just where the story line is going and just page through to the end.  Will have to check out the author and see if there are any other books that would be equally challenging.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great<br />Very easy to see and use. I really like big buttons and display. It is very convenient. Thanks<br />.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I got this for my 9 yr old son as one of his birthday presents. He loved it! I plan to purchase more of them to give to his friends for their birthdays. A great gift!
B00124BNF4|5.0|good selection of talking heads tracks<br />lots of songs cheap price cant beat that<br />pretty much all my favorites<br />definitely a classic band
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a fun filled game with lots of things to do u can hunt you can build houses and other fun things you can even fish and usually when you go somewhere in your wagon you get extra points only sometimes.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Can quote this movie word for word.  Ask anyone who knows me. Saw this movie at a drive-in.  Love the interactions between Roy, Richard (his character was the reason why I wanted to be a &#34;shark expert) and Robert.  So suspenseful, camera in and out of the water, not knowing what the shark looks like until at last half-way through the film.  Fantastic!!
B003SI605K|5.0|Even though this is a good movie the book is 10 times better. I would recommend reading it so you fully understand some parts of the movie.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|I bought this for my sons 8th birthday. I hope he likes it because I thought Lego was pricey and was tons smaller than I expected.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|The storyline of this movie is so cute! We absolutely loved and glad we got it! Have watched it many times and never get tired of it!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game isn't just A game it is A way of life. See when I play this no the scribblenauts remix not only getting better at spelling but I'm having so much fun that I don't even play any other game.  Okay maybe 1or2or5 but my point is that scribblenauts remix
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite game. The only thing I would like is to be able to play any and all of the cities on the world tour.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wish things ended differently with Gale. We never get to find out the kids names!!! I totally recommend this
B00884GR0W|5.0|Its cheaper and its more fun, it needs a few things but its more than I can say about Minecraft PE. No offence to Minecraft lovers. The graphics are better too!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are the best headphones for the money on the market.  This is my 3rd pair in the last 15 years or so and they r still exactly the same.  home studio,home stereo, mp3  sounds great on all.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|After installation cpu worked as expected. Runs much cooler than my previous one. So far no issues, I still have never had an intel cpu die on me.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think it's a good book because it mirrors a kids life. I just think it is an awesome book.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I liked the movie the acting was not great but the performances were on time the chemistry was good the premise of the movie was better very good direction
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Utterly re-watchable. Cast has great chemistry. Love the writing & the visuals. Highly recommend this show. But start with season one & work your way thru. It's totally worth it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Yes I enjoyed the sarcastic yet scientific nature of this book. I can't wait to see what Andy Weir has next.
0385342063|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella.  Her books never fail.  Like wonderful romantic comedies, they make you smile.  I will likely be reading this one  again.
006029129X|5.0|It seemed to take a little while to get but worth the wait and DEFINATELY worth the price.  I love the book.  It was in pretty good condition.  The paper cover was a little crumpled but I just took it off.  My 18 month old would have tore it to pieces anyways.  I'm really happy with my purchase!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I completely loved this book from the first page to the last. Deborah Harkness is brilliant. If you're a fan of sci-fi or fantasy, you have to read this book.
B000W94FE6|5.0|There is structure to it.<br />There is practicality, and chance to be pragmatic based on what you learn.<br />Silver bullet is never offered, and book points throughout it is individual journey to make your life a flow.
B0081J9OWC|5.0|Addicting!!! These kids are sooo unique and sooo talented! Fresh new sound, wonderful lyrics and an interesting choice of instruments! Makes you want to just dance, dance, dance!
B007MAETA8|4.0|Right off the bat this sounded more California-rock, with easy going rhythms and melodies. Not too much for the guitar lover but not as pop as some of the previous albums.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|This was a rather short but intertwining story. I am starting to read the next Theodore Boone novel. I really prefer Grisham's spy and military novel's but this was a nice change.<br /><br />T
B00ANY94A0|5.0|My daughter loved it and had it put together and incorporated into her Lego village in no time! Thank you
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Download and read about the time the musical was being released as a movie. It was a re-read for me [high school]. It was boring then but now it's slightly more interesting given that I'm much older now and can apply it today's environment.
B0026S1XD2|3.0|I purchased this because of the memory I have for the movie. I can say this: the movie soundtrack is the best part of the album. For the remainder, it is basically self-indulgence by Mr. Oldfield.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Loved it certainly hope it's not not the last I'll see of Sookie actually considering going back and reading them over again.
B00ANY7V8M|5.0|My daughter loved it and had it put together and incorporated into her Lego village in no time! Thank you!
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|Superior space tale. Well crafted storyline, but then I expect that from David Weber. Weber continues to develop his series characters. We'll have to see how the next volume goes. I'm looking forward to reading it. Only problem is you gotta charge the batteries a couple of times to read the whole thing. Guess I'm old enough to remember &#34;no-batteries required&#34; reading.
B00007LTIC|3.0|I purchased this CD because it is one of the three albums this group is playing in its entirety during the upcoming tour (the others are the yes Album and Close to the Edge). As I did not own it I wanted to be familiar with the music to be played. In my opinion, it is not up to the same standards as the other two though it is still a fine album.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is worth the money. Not only does it keep your mind thing the game is hard to pull away from cause you want to know what happens next.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Greatest invention for my guy.  My little one had a terrible time trying to keep paci's in his mouth and was sitting them out and getting frustrated.  At 2 months he spits this out but can grab and re-stick back in. Washed it in the dishwasher without any issue.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game for seekers and finders. Didn't give a five due to having to go to several screens to get  to game screen.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|After all this time, I was looking forward to a \\"new\\" release but expected mostly dreck.  I was impressed with what I heard.  No, I suppose it does not compare favorably to the studio releases from 43 years ago, but geez . . .  It is as good as War Heroes, Hendrix in the West, and Rainbow Bridge and a lot better than Midnight Lightning and Crash Landing - the original five posthumous releases.  I won't compare it to the bazillion live recordings that have come out since some are great and others not so much.  On the whole I thought it really offered insight as to where Jimi was going and where he was.  I enjoyed the whole thing and his playing is superb.  It is certainly as good as all the variations of A Cry of Love that have been released over the years, i.e. Valleys of Neptune, South Saturn Delta, Voodoo Soup, etc.<br /><br />Hey while I'm here - Hendrix family - figure out how to get the licensing back on War Heroes, Hendrix in the West, and Rainbow Bridge.  Great albums!  I would like to own digital copies without spending $50 for a bootleg.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game so fun helps pass the time<br />Thanks for a great game and making it free<br />George
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Jaycee' s life experience before, during and after her 18 yrs abduction were heart wrenching. In the beginning, I felt sorry for all her turmoil but the few chapters of the book has showed me her positive progress. I wish her and family the very best.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly's books just keep getting better and better. This is perhaps the most mature, most emotionally sensitive Harry Bosch.  Everything about it is wonderful.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|I e-mailed asking how I access the calendar.  I did not get a reply.  Just this note asking me to review the app.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Get this book if you're ready to turn your life around! What a GREAT resource for doing the Whole 30, eating primal, and just having the reasons behind the questions. Phenomenal book; researched, well-said, and great recipes. Literally changed the way I will eat forever.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|This was to  big you could not find a word<br />I did not enjoy this book that is why I'm giving it 2 stars
193700788X|1.0|Beyond disappointed with the book. Really angry that I wasted my hard earned money on it. Did she even reread the previous books first or just decide she could do whatever she wanted since they are her books? The HEA makes no sense and the characters we off the entire book. Completely off. She also had no right to have Eric do a complete 180 and turn him into something he wasn't the entire series. I had preordered After Dead, but I cancelled it after reading this pathetic excuse for a story. I feel cheated. I feel used. I will never again buy another book written by this woman.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Unlike many free fire apps, this battery status app works great. Get it. When you start your Kindle the battery is the first thing you'll check.
193700788X|4.0|I have spent many pleasant hours in Sookie land and this book<br />does a good job of touching on all the characters and worlds<br />out there in that land.  Ms Harris has so many interesting<br />characters and events in her mind, and has left me with many<br />images I won't forget.<br />I love the restraint --- every little detail was NOT sewn up..<br />Still things to wonder about.  There is a nice final ambiguity<br />about her relationship with Sam- I like that an effort was made<br />to explain how he could be drawn to wild ladies and yet<br />finally seem to focus on Sookie.<br />...<br />Actually, I am glad they have found their places in<br />this dance and are dancing far away as I wonder what<br />new people and ideas are yet to come.
B00439MV42|5.0|I was able to watch this movie as soon as I bought it for 24 hours and it was exactly like it was described.
B00CC1JXYE|5.0|The cover fits perfectly and is of very good quality. All the features are working as advertised. A light cover that goes well with the phone.
B00BN3EE1O|1.0|This movie was slow moving, the storyline was predictable, and the acting was not good. This movie was neither a love story nor a thriller.  I couldn't wait for the movie to end so I could go to bed.  Usually I agree with the majority of reviewers on Amazon.  However, this time I couldn't disagree more, which leaves me wondering if I watched the same movie everyone else did.
B0001KZNLA|5.0|Loved this movie as a teenager and was happy to finally buy it for myself on DVD.  If you enjoy other films from this era like &#34;Sixteen Candles&#34;, &#34;Pretty in Pink&#34;, or others...then you will love this one!
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|Its not easy to use its hard to spin the bottle to cute I have been through so many bottles all ready and not one was useable I hate it want to send it back
B004DK5CW4|5.0|All expectations were met.  I played the entire movie and did not have any problems I am happy with this purchase.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Except for &#34;It Gets Better&#34;, FUN pounds out anthem after passionate anthem.  I love every other song on this CD, and am not afraid to crank each one up and sing them at the top of my lungs.  The passion and emotion that the band writes and sings is unparrelled.  So happy with this CD.
0316098337|5.0|Wow! What an amazingly and surprisingly powerful novel! I actually bought this book almost three years ago, eager to read it after hearing its intriguing premise (a young woman was kidnapped seven years previous and the story is told from her five year old's perspective). As the book garnered attention and accolades, I kept meaning to move it up in my daunting To Be Read pile, but after an eerily case of life imitating art, I decided to crack open its spine immediately.<br /><br />Entirely from five year old, Jack's, perspective, some of the horror of their plight is lessened by being filtered through his innocently joyful eyes. Still, this is a sad and miraculous story that feels so genuine - both in the actual plotline and in the way the point of view is handled. It is an absolutely riveting read. And though the ending is quite eloquent, it leaves you wanting to hear more of their story.<br /><br />This is a very well-written and excellently executed novel. So often books that receive a lot of immediate attention and praise can be ratehr disappointing. Not so with this one - it truly deserves all of the received attention and more. It is an impressive novel. The use of the young perspective never once crosses the line into gimmicky or false and in fact maintains a consistent and genuine feel. I am looking forward to reading more from this talented author!
B001KZG99A|4.0|I enjoyed the movie as did my family. I liked how characters were themselves throughout the movie and not morphing personality wise. I.e Tony's announcement at the end was very in character and in personality.
B00005JMCN|2.0|When you play the DVD it sticks and freezes half way through the beginning of the first track/section.  You then have to forward to the second track/section and from there it is fine.  I attempted to inform you and put in for a replacement, but the system told me that i couldn't.  So I can live with it.
B0033TJATW|5.0|This was the perfect gift for my daughtet. We owned the VHS of this video which is obsolete so I was happy when I found it on Amazon. They were out when I first ordered it then the next day there it was. We're all happy he was so very good!! Thank you Amazon.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I like the way this book was written.  Hard to put down.  Had many layers.  I would definitely like to read another book by this author.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far, it's different from regular hidden object games. I really am enjoying the changes. I think if you play hidden object games, you should give it a try!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great game, amazing graphics, and super fun. I am amazed about this game. I am a huge fan of marvel and a big fan of this game.
B00932A4XE|4.0|You get to see different story lines.  They are funny and touching at the same time.  It was heartfelt to see what Jennifer Lopez's character goes through.  They all seem to be almost true to life with the movie exaggerations of course.  Would recommend to all those pregnant or thinking about it.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Fantastic debut album from Mumford & Sons.  I really loved listening to this album again and again.  Give them a listen if you like that genre.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|At first you get this and you are frustraded on the games. Then you get used to it. but then you run out of coins and are so boerd on the game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Like an onion, this story peels away the layers moving from a simple superficial tale of survival to a deeper, more complex story.
0439023491|5.0|This is a great trilogy!  I didn't know what to expect when I started the set but it got better and each book is better.  It is one of those things that you won't lay down.
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you're tired of the same old boring aerobics video, this is the one to try!  In 20 minutes I felt more worked muscles than I normally did in 1 hour.  I love her encouraging no-nonsense attitude.
B000W04S6U|5.0|i love soundtracks from movies and games. halo is my favorite video game and i just had to have the soundtrack from it. im so glad i bought it. it was from amazon prime, for to me in 2 days, and was affordable. all and all, im a happy customer.
B007THA4FI|1.0|While the book is well written, the story is abysmal.  There is no joy in it at all.  Every character seems despicable in some way.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|as usual he is wonderful to listen to and the guitar playing was incredible...we need more<br />singers like him.  always enjoy listening to his music
1878424319|5.0|We are constantly getting life lessons and this is simple and to the point and I got exactly what I was looking for.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A real page Turner.  Keeps you on your toes with excitement at every corner. An excellent conclusion to the hunger games series.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fantastic game, totally hooked on it! Anything Nemo or Disney has my attention. I just wish i could play it on Facebook as well. I was disappointed to find that i couldnt even get the app for FB only onto my phone and kindle. Maybe an upgrade in the game is in order after all what game isnt on FB.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet but I am already eagerly awaiting book 6. Tyrion continues to be intriguing and the ultimate class clown.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|More than enough features and buttons for the moderate gamer. The four profiles make it very easy to switch sensitivity and button settings on the fly.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I wish this book was written 25 years ago. Wonderful story to sooth the troubled soul! Thanks Stephen for the realistic portrayal of emotional living.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Can't wait to see the next 2 movies! Special effects have been improved since The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|Amazing book, Roald Dahl is a true author. He can turn absolutely anything into a story so marvellous. MATILDA is definitely a favourite! I wish he had stayed alive longer to create many more amazing and hilarious stories, and I cannot forget to mention how out of this world MATILDA and many other of his books are.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I Like It Because It Is Just Like Grand Theft Auto And That I Can Kill People And I Can Swim #!!!!!!
1938469003|4.0|A good historical IPA reference book. Very cool to have the historical recipes and a few clones of newer IPAs.
B00005JL0I|1.0|I knew this was going to be a bad movie when I bought it, but I wanted it to complete my James Bond movie collection. However, I never imagined just how bad it really is. The movie had 5 different directors so there's no consistancy. The whole premise is stupid. The only redeaming feature is it has a lot of big name stars who pop up throughout so it's fun to see the many great actors who stooped to be in this disaster of a film.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Love this show! Can not say enough about the first season. Amazing writing and characterization! Some of the best acting on TV.
B000FIMG68|5.0|it was great. have almost the entire series. it came very promptly. arrived in a nice box. i will get the rest
1475143389|5.0|So far i've read a lot of good advices and information about fitness and exercising. I also bought \\"The Shredded Chef\\" to guide me better as to what to eat.<br />I am pretty skinny myself weight 124 pounds, 5'7, 20 years old.<br />Figured what do i got to lose right?<br />I will be updating my review as i see changes/progress.<br />I have a question about the \\"AB Roller\\". is it goood for training ABS, ARMS and Chest?.<br />thanks for sharing your knowledge with us. you rock!
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Season Two was just as incredible as Season One. The writing is incredible as is the acting. Wish the show had went beyond the few short seasons that it did! Truly amazing work!
0393327345|4.0|I don't recommend reading this while eating or right before bedtime. Better than the movie, and I didn't expect that. Really skillfully done.
B0053O8ARI|5.0|I wasn't sure about this show as I started mid-season (season 2), but I became intrigued and followed it through and then purchased Season 1 on blu-ray.... and I am a forever-fan, now. Everyone involved is brilliant, usually in multiple ways.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|The movie was a very good combination, love story and suspense - well done movie!  Just wish Amazon was working because it kept cutting out through out the movie, so it made it very poor for viewing.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Understanding the risk our soldiers take to protect other soldiers was an important thing to learn about.  The book covers lots of detail in a what is generally a fast moving scenario.  Overall, well written.
1849904251|5.0|Excellent case book on the BBC's Sherlock tv series. Loads of pictures from the show (from closer set scenes to evidence photos) and features several sticky notes written back and forth between John and Sherlock about the cases they have covered so far. Very amusing and a MUST HAVE for all fans of the series!
B00AW8VUDG|5.0|love the music and the cover is so cute. the songs are awesome and love the lyrics. would buy this again.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|It has it's scary moments.  The plot is pretty interesting as well.<br />I was afraid that it was going to be one of those movies where you never really get a good look at the monster but they take care of that as the movie progresses.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain is really cute as a short haired rocker in this movie.  That was a nice touch.<br /><br />The movie really seemed like one of those M Night Shyamalan flicks.  If that is a good thing, you will like it.  If not, you probably won't.
B001H9JBW6|4.0|Well written story acted out by a great and versatile actor. Miniseries is broken up into 5 episodes, so you don't have to sit down and watch it all at once for it to make sense. A frightening look at how the near future might turn out with technology and government corruption.
B005CRPB0U|5.0|Is there a better author than the great J.K Rowling herself? I think not. Another fantastic read by the one who showed us the wizard world!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful acting set in a beautiful estate where polite words and manners can hold a myriad of meanings.  Lovely - highly recommend!
B000002MUQ|5.0|I've had this CD quite a few times. People want to borrow it & I never get it back. I don't do that now. I enjoy it. I do skip through a couple instrumentals. They're good to start with but after a couple listens get on my nerves for some reason. Worth every penny none the less.
B003QNXPUK|5.0|I HIGHLY recommend  buying this screen protector. It does a great job at protecting both sides of your phone and isn't that difficult to put on.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The book was really well written. It is a little slow and I'm not to sure how he'll wrap everything up in one book. That's probably why it's taking him longer to write it. But still he's such an entertaining writer.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is a great book that I read while on vacation.  It had a lot of stories to share with my friends who have then purchased or are about to read this book.  As promised the book read like a Malcolm Gladwell book and I intend to see if this author has any more books for me.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|It is just the most awesome game ever!  You are never disappointed. I introduced this game to my friends and we play it once every couple weeks. It's awesome - the pieces and cards are beautiful to look at, and it's so great trying out new strategies.  Looking forward to getting the expansion packs. A highly recommended game for the family!  we enjoy this one very much
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is a great app to look things up, whether you are selling, buying or bidding on something.  It is very useful whenever you are not at your computer.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is a great Sci-Fi series.  Too bad it wasn't continued for several seasons.  We've watched it several times.  The quality of the Blu-ray is also as expected.  Highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun and addicting game i really like it<br />And it you can really loose track of time in this game very often
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I haven't cried like this for a long time after NS's The Notebook & The Wedding. I look forward to reading another book by J. Green.
B008B68IUY|5.0|My girls  are crazy about monster high dolls.......me too.....this is a cute looking car. Perfectly ghoultastic and perfect for tooling around scaris.
B0012PDVUS|5.0|Blade Runner is classic SciFi and will always be one of the best movies out.<br />I have always loved this movie.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Munch better than the original. My girls and I love it. Wish o could catch the king crab at home!
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|The romance is really well done. I thought that the violence was way too much and overdone for my taste.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was really fun and challenging, but I agree with other reviews, I want more!!  After a couple of hours the game will be completed.  Hopefully additions will follow
B000JMKRKC|3.0|A long and twisted way to get to the end that you suspected all along.  Glad I didn't have to pay for this one.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I so enjoyed this book!  Had all the things I loved about gothic style reading. It's like reading, Jane Eyre, Withering Heights and The Secret Garden all in one. Suspenseful, love, family, evil and a twist! Wonderful
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|In light of the recent school shooting, the narrative in We need to talk about Kevin became both rivoting and terribly upsetting.  The novel questions some of our basis concepts of parenting versus the &#34;bad seed&#34;
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Love this movie. I had to have it in blue ray. Such a heartfelt romantic movie. This is prob one of my favorite films
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Come on John.....really??  What started out as a decent story became an unbelievable mess.  Very disappointing.  It will be a stretch for me to come back.
1579128955|5.0|Two purchases were Christmas gifts for my high school teacher children.  A great, fun reading resource, even if you aren't a scientist.
B008CRC506|5.0|Everything as we expected on a SMASH DVD. We just hope it will also be offered in Blue Ray soon.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I've always had curly hair that can get pretty wild and like most, spent countless years and dollars attempting to straighten it and conform to what I thought was the ideal hairstyle. I now have a daughter who is still a toddler, but has inherited my ringlets and needs her curls tended to. I decided to embrace my own curls and through researching curly hair care regimens, found this book.  Wow - it really reminded me of  those feelings in my youth of how much I hated my hair!  If only someone had helped me then to care for my crazy locks, it would've saved me years of heartache! I am determined not to let this happen to my child. This book has a very practical and simple approach to curly care - be gentle with products, keep it moisturized and have fun! I am looking forward to trying out the techniques and whipping up a few of the conditioning recipes. I highly recommend reading this if you or someone you care for is curly - you won't regret it!
B00A85EMVK|5.0|It is TOP GUN, what more does one need to know? The Blue Ray only makes it better. Buckle up and hang on as Maverick pushes the envelope again.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Never regretted getting a second controller. Works great, charge lasts forever. Easy to setup and configure. Great stuff last forever.
193700788X|1.0|This book was truly awful. It lacked the imagination of the previous books. It also felt like the characters were inconsistent with what I've come to love. The author seemed detached from her characters and I had trouble relating to their personalities and their behavior. It was kind of sad because I loved this series so much and had made an investment in this little world of Sookie's, and now I wish I hadn't done that because I hate the way it ended. If you haven't read this book, DON'T, and the ending can be whatever you want it to be in your imagination. I honestly wish I could \\"unread\\" it. It seems like the last few books were taking us in a certain direction, and then- BAM-what the heck? It just doesn't make sense to me.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|The movie is entertaining and worth watching as an action film with its unique Reacher character.  Tom Cruise captured some of Jack Reacher's personna.  However, Lee Childs' Jack Reacher books cut a huge, physically imposing Reacher character without the gun and driving expertise.  Bad casting to put small Tom Cruise in the roll!  Read the books if you like this type of action.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|Overall, another good one by Nicholas Sparks. My only complaint is Kevin's characterization is a bit rambling and redundant. But overall, a good read!
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Tom Cruise has done some bad movies recently, but it looks like he may be getting back on track to produce some quality movies worth seeing.  This is one of those movies.  I bought this for my husband, but I (as a woman) love this movie as well.  I recommend it to Tom Cruise fans or anyone that likes action type of movies.  This one is very well done!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Right away I didn't like the fact that Bradley Cooper is 38 and Jennifer Lawrence is 22 which is that constant reminder in life that in the movies guys seem to only be compatible with girls 15-20 years younger than them. Jennifer played the part well but I wasn't buying the whole crazy, sleeping around, widower thing, I think another actress would have been a better choice for this particular role for compatibility purposes.  As far as the storyline it was alright and the actors carried it well.  The movie was predictable all the way through but it still was a good movie and recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Very long then crashing together at the end not much detail at the end like she got tired of writing
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|Another bad performance by Julianne Hough, she is truly a bad actress and the only save acting-wise was Josh Duhamel.  The storyline...TERRIBLE!  spoiler alert: Basically this is the Julia Roberts movie \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\".  Abused wife breaks free and moves to new town in constant fear of being  found, she cuts hair and false name and is snotty to everyone in fear of letting someone new in, but then a new love interest emerges who is of course out of the loop of her past, then in the end it all  catches up with her when the crazy husband finally finds her and all is revealed but the new love interest is so blind that all the lying is irrelevant and they live happily ever after....oh and this story line is so old and the actress is so bad that the writers at the very last second before credits decide to add their own twist - The new love interests wife that died from cancer was actually a ghost through the movie that had befriended Julianne Houghs character and we all realize that at the end when shown a picture of his wife that died...WHAT?
B00BQUUH7E|5.0|Very fun addictive fan  I love many characters game modes. Are fun get this game now you will love it I promise
1416550550|4.0|This book actually, for me, is a 4 1/2 star book. I would have rated it 5 stars except that in the first third of it I felt that it was being drawn out too much. From that point on, however, I could not wait to pick the book up each evening. The story, told from the perspective of three women - Eliza, Nell, and Cassandra - during the era in which each lived presented enough twists and turns to keep me involved with each of them. The bit of melodrama fits with the times, mainly the early 1900s, 1970s, and 2005, and ages of the characters at those times so was not a deterrent but rather an addition to a good story. I loved the writer's use of language and could see each scene - the manor, the cottage and the garden.  I felt the greatest affinity for Nell and Eliza; Cassandra's character just didn't inspire the same strong feelings. The many other characters are equally as well developed. Rose and her mother are central to the story as are their husbands. Their needs and actions are entwined with and help to define the three women and are pivotal in setting the stage for the mysteries in this tale. I developed quite the love/hate relationship with Rosé and had similarly strong feelings for the other sub characters but without any feeling of liking them. I had not read Kate Morton prior to this but I look forward to reading more of her books now.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I use the Cooler Master Hyper 212+ with the included thermal grease on my i5-3570K which i overclock to 3.9GHz. I'm sure I can go higher, but the 212 keeps the CPU cool enough such that no thermal throttling is triggered during a sustained heavy CPU load (e.g, Handbrake). Fan noise is minimal, and quieter than a HDD. I didn't have any trouble mounting to the motherboard. Yes, it's a tall cooler, so make sure you check your case specs.<br /><br />Get's 5 stars for doing what it says it does at the right price.

0812984412|1.0|So many people liked book that I finally read it, all of it, endlessly on and on, only because I hoped that I would find some point and/or justification for the style in which is was written. Conclusion: huge disappointment, not worth it. I am very glad that I borrowed it from the library and didn't pay for it. I would recommend it to nobody.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book just wasn't believeable.  The idea was too far out there for me to really buy it.  And the ending...

B003B02O7I|4.0|One of Grisham's better novels. I thought he wrapped the story up very well and couldn't be more relieved that the ending was as well-thought out as the build-up of the story. Sometimes his novels end very abruptly without tying off the lives of his protagonist. However, I felt he left Nate with a sense of peace that I hoped he could eventually attain.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this game because you can take care of your horse and have fun with him and you can compete.
030726999X|5.0|this is another great read, if you liked the other two books you will LOVE this one, perfect ending to the trilogy
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love Flow Free....I am on Jumbo Pack 13 x 13 which is very difficult, but good for my mind....I have a lot of friends that feel the same.  It is comparative to Words with Friends which I play all the time.  I love Candy Crush Saga so much better than Candy Swipe, but I am not able to get it on my KIndle Fire for some reason....only Candy Swipe.  Haven't really done the jigsaw puzzles as yet.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|This is an awesome body of work and a wonderful peak inside one of the best bands of all time.  If you remember the 70's and 80's, this is for you.  It's hard to watch the dissent grow but as they say, who expects bands to stay together as long as the Eagles did or have done. It's a great insight into a great American band.<br />The new stuff holds up well and the harmony is still tight and lyrical.  I hope these guys rock for years to come!
1451695195|5.0|It was a book that my book club chose for this month and I am so glad I purchased it vs. borrowing from my local library, only because, I'm glad to be adding it to my personal collection.  It was an &#34;easy&#34; read and something that everyone could relate to regarding the illness that caused his NDE and thoughts/images of what he presented about Heaven.  It was an amazing story and I'm thrilled he shared his experience.  It gave more confirmation to my belief that Heaven is waiting for us after we leave this Earth and that Love is the only answer to heal all things.  Great read, great story, great faith booster for sure.

1451683405|1.0|It could be funny to imagine which steed each of the Four Horseman of New Atheism would actually ride.  To start off I think the easiest cowl to slide away would be Christopher Hitchens'.  In my mind it's not only appropriate but hilarious to imagine him straddling a fat War horse, whiskey glass in hand, smoldering opponents from on high with verbal flair and that menacing yet insouciant gaze.<br /><br />But War is dead.<br /><br />We're left now with his three amigos: Death (Richard Dawkins), who's job isn't to be inspiring so much as just right; Famine (Daniel Dennett), whose noble girth and uncanny resemblance to Santa Claus don't help distract from his often frail positions; and, of course, Pestilence (Sam Harris), who's ability to spread invective is novel even if the bulk of his positions just lead back to Death anyway.<br /><br />A potentially dour ride to rebellion against the rotting paradigm of religious hegemony, but it's what we got.  So before I get slotted as a hater, for the most part I think what they do should be appreciated and though it's sometimes ridiculous, as in protesting Christmas on billboards or something, it's ultimately necessary.  They're also the highest-profile messengers of atheism/agnosticism, and so I think they should also be held to a similarly high standard. For most people who aren't atheists, these guys are going to be atheism, and that makes what they say, however awesome, ridiculous or incoherent it might be, possess a certain level of importance regardless of it's content.  Which in turn implies we should pay close attention to what that content is.<br /><br />Sam Harris, as another reviewer on Amazon has pointed out, is a master of the polemic.  Well, kind of a squire I think, since polemics were really War's bag, but Pestilence feeds off of what he can.  Unlike Hitchens, Harris employs a very methodical and unemotional appeal in his language, one that relies on science and a clear adherence to rational principles.  He writes for a general audience, no doubt in the interest of becoming a household name and a larger force in mainstream American culture, but this can potentially lead to a sacrifice in rigor and in making an honest argument, and I'd argue that it does.<br /><br />The sensationalist opening is a perfect starting place.  Here Harris methodically describes the murder of a family and the razing of their house with the dispassionate voice of a pulp crime novelist.  His purpose here is simple: he's setting the stakes, and in true polemic fashion, he's making you fall onto one side or another.  Either he's right, and the murder of a family by psychopathic killers was an inevitable act in which the murderers were faultless, or he's wrong, and he's going to set out to convince you why that second notion is impossible.<br /><br />He begins his assault by setting the stage and briefly describes the historical positions taken on free will.  This is done basically for simplicities sake, as one can write whole books (and people have) going over the convoluted notions of free will and philosophies that spring therefrom, so Harris is from the start making things easier and saying \\"don't worry about all this, just listen to me.\\"  He then defends his assertion that determinism eliminates the possibility of free will \\"as most people\\" define it and moves right along into the evidence for this, which amounts to an a priori argument and research done in the 80's by a neuroscientist named Libet which has become kind of a favorite parable in free will arguments.<br /><br />Harris' writing is succinct, and his stance is technically valid.  He comes to it armed with an argument that has been used for centuries, namely that nothing can exist outside of nature and yet interact with nature (the hard libertarian conundrum), and he has a talent for tackling issues and making them simple and even fun to read.<br /><br />The problem with this book isn't Harris' style or the basic efficacy of his stance, it's that the whole work is a muddled farmer's field riddled with so many overreaches, hazy assertions and strange absurdities that you wonder half the time if you should worry about the dilapidated straw man in front of you or the pile of poop you just stepped in.  Because he isn't really out to treat the idea fully, he doesn't have time to bother with all of the nuance and just comes down like a hammer on the anvil of someone's psyche, hoping to sculpt their thinking by just bludgeoning away all of the legs he claims free will proponents stand on.<br /><br />The straw man: he quotes a philosopher (Eddie Nahmias) to give a definition of free will which comes down to the idea that it involves people making a conscious plan and then executing on it.  Fair enough.  Then he pulls a slick sidestep and says that's not what he's attacking.  Okay.  Then what are you attacking?  Free will \\"as most people see it.\\"  Oh.  Well what's that?  Is it libertarianism?  Maybe, but which kind?  Details don't matter I guess, cause he doesn't bother to define it.  He does hazily describe his idea of what it would require, but this is just firelight on the wall. So I'll guess, knowing Harris' general thematic throughline, and say he's attacking what religious people think, which is not really thought through at all but just sort of taken for granted on their part.  Soul stuff.  But I don't know what that is, and apparently neither does he or them for that matter.  So what notion of free will is Harris arguing against really?  You want to know too?  Well too bad, Harris doesn't have time for your second guessing, he's too busy with that hammer.<br /><br />He then appeals to Libet's experiments, and this is when the smell of manure becomes pungent.  He gives a little taste first anecdotally and then later as evidence against the amorphous free will he hasn't described.  But, strangely for such a seemingly rational account, he doesn't include any of the critiques, including scientific ones, on this experiment's implications.  He doesn't even grant that Libet himself didn't think it discounted free will.  Instead, there's a leap on Harris' part when he slides off into science fiction and postulates that scientists of the future, given the supposed success of Libet's experiments, would be able to perfectly predict a person's next action using brain scans.  That's just tossed out there like it's already happened and then he's on to more pressing issues, like how his decision to choose wine or beer at his next meal is out of his control.  Comfortable for him maybe, but I'm still drowning in the pit trying figure out how I got here.<br /><br />All of this ends up being a foundation to attack the current system of retributive justice in America.  Here, Harris makes a valid point that this brand of Wild West \\"string 'em up!\\"  justice is ineffectual and based on archaic and even cruel ideas on punishment.  My favorite part  at the end though might be when he talks about how one can experience a kind of free will by \\"taking hold of the strings,\\" while of course realizing that you aren't really.  How this fits in with his argument I don't know, but then he didn't describe what notion of free will he was attacking and already put on his tinfoil prophecy cap, so forget it I guess.  I also don't completely understand why free will would need to take center stage in a discussion on the efficacy of retributive justice, but this is getting too long already, so I'll give him a mulligan and just let that slide.<br /><br />This gets me to what the main problem with this book is.  I've been saying book, but to be honest it's more of an essay.  It's only around 70 pages and can be read in under an hour by just about anyone.  This is in keeping with Harris' other recent works, like \\"Lying\\" and \\"Letter to a Christian Nation,\\" which are short dealings with certain specific subjects.  They're to the point, they got some evidence to back them up, and they're cheap.<br /><br/>They're also really, really easy to read.<br /><br />They boil down to being like Mike Myers on SNL's coffee talk launching a topic and then squeezing out the words \\"discuss amongst yourselves.\\"  They provoke a response and get a conversation going, but don't work too well when cited in and of themselves because they don't deal very fully with their topics.<br /><br />But this doesn't stop people from trying to lean on them.  The muddling of facts and assertions employed in this essay, and often by Harris in general, can get very annoying, as fans of his take sick pleasure in citing him and his evidence to no end, a reckless appeal to authority that seems strange until you realize that he's effectively become science to these people.  This might seem like a really unfounded claim of mine until you actually read a book like Free Will, which postulates select scientific evidence to support it's claims but doesn't qualify them.  If this worries you, well, it worries me too.  That's why this review is so long.<br /><br />The unfortunate by-product of scientists like Harris turning into philosophers is that many people don't do a good job of discerning between the two disciplines.  This is already after accepting the observation that science is really murky for people in general and philosophy is like a Gordian sludge-knot.  What books like this end up accomplishing is allowing science to become a mystical discipline in the minds of people who want certainty, and scientists themselves like priests, collectors of arcane knowledge only they are capable of understanding, who discern the bones of experimentation for us and then decree how it all works.<br /><br />This isn't how it should go, but it's how the cock struts in practice.  Cue climate change as a perfect example.  People's misunderstanding of the evidence and of the scientific process leads to ludicrous idealistic stances and idiotic assertions, which would be comical if they didn't have such far-reaching implications.<br /><br />And the implications of free will are far-reaching, as Sam Harris and his sensationalist opening admit.  Just ask anyone on death row who's going to be executed but might be saved due to new advances in brain scanning and it's odd acceptance in the courts.<br /><br />But in reality it goes even further than that.  The idea of free will is at the heart of what it is to be a conscious being, so in effect it's implications plunge right into the essence of what it is to be human.  That's some pretty serious stuff to handle in 70 pages.  Is it done with grace?  Is there any appeal to contrary evidence, or an attempt to honestly present the opposition's argument and then unravel it?  No.  There's not even a real attempt to fucking define the concept being attacked in the first place.  There's just a warm blanket of certainty patched together with weak claims that will smother you if you're not careful.<br /><br />What I end up having to take away from all this is that at best this book is an inept and shallow appeal for change, or at worst a cheap flippant cash grab.  The book is so short and easy to read that most of the people who peruse this review will probably just read the thing anyway.  That Harris is a loud voice in the din of contemporary American dialogue, and that his previous profession is gaining popularity in the courts, should both be worrisome given how little the former is interested in acknowledging any other point of view and how effortlessly the latter has been securing the decisions of judges.<br /><br />And before I become a target of the determinist zombie horde that apparently trolls these sites looking to cudgel any dissent, this review isn't really a defense of free will as a concept.  It's a critique of this book and it's presentation of it.  The question itself is complex, with a long history of philosophical speculation and academic masturbation, and I'm not dressed to get wet here.  Hitchens' famous response when asked about free will was \\"yes I have free will; I have no choice but to have it.\\"  An ironic admission, one that hints at all of the complexity inherent in the question itself.  The biggest irony of this essay?  That it's dedicated to Chris Hitchens.<br /><br />War might be dead, but the principles he fought on, namely that it's how we think that's most important, and that we come at issues honestly and with a respect for human potential, don't need to have died with him.  The steady march of secularism shows no signs of stopping, and faces plenty of challenges ahead by religious zealots and slaves of the eternal, but ultimately it's how we proceed when we've left the superstition behind that will define our future, and that makes critiquing the three remaining horsemen and other famous thinkers, however legitimate their stances are, perhaps important enough to lamely post reviews on Amazon./>They're also really, really easy to read.<br /><br />They boil down to being like Mike Myers on SNL's coffee talk launching a topic and then squeezing out the words \\"discuss amongst yourselves.\\"  They provoke a response and get a conversation going, but don't work too well when cited in and of themselves because they don't deal very fully with their topics.<br /><br />But this doesn't stop people from trying to lean on them.

I feel like I wasted tons of time reading 12 books to have the rug pulled out from under me.  I actually started skipping through pages trying to find a mention of Eric again.

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse, for the price, has a lot of great features. Many of which you find on a more expensive mouse, however, after use, I did not like the feel of this while gaming. The curve of the mouse, especially on the right side, is uncomfortable. They should have put a coated surface on that side. Even with the high DPI, you will lift the mouse in the heat of action during a game. With the smooth surface, it is difficult to do, even with no weights. Also, your hand does not fit well on the mouse because of this. However, given the price and the features it provides, you are definitely getting a great buy. But, in my case, it is somewhat uncomfortable to use for long periods of time during a gaming session, therefore I am going back to my other gaming mouse. I do recommend you give it a try however as you may be very happy with it. I gave it 4 stars as the price and features are very attractive.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is probably the closest thing you will find to being grammatically correct. I haven't played the game, but if I can interpret the language of the idiots, it is a lot like temple run 2.

B009NY43NY|1.0|I've followed the SVM series for YEARS now, and I'm very disappointed in how the last book was written (even the last couple). Sookie and various other characters felt very OOC, there was no action, and I don't understand how we got the ending that we did.<br /><br />For anyone who is contemplating this book or series, please rethink you're decision. Not worth your while. Very disappointed in the last couple books and CH writing.
1568363931|5.0|I haven't tried all the recipes yet, but my hubby and I are very happy with the ones we've tried so far. We're trying to eat healthier-but-tasty food and healthier-but-filling portions, this book really helps with that. I've been a fan of the author Makiko Itoh and her websites ([...]) for a while now, and she still cranked out some pretty yummy stuff in this book. Recipes are easy to follow, lots of information on obentos and Japanese cooking in general, and just an easy read. I would recommend this to my friends and family for sure!

0756404746|5.0|I bought this book after searching through Amazon for something new from someone new.  In the past couple of years, I have journeyed into the fantasy realm and have read the Lord of the Rings series, A Song of Ice and Fire series, and the War of the Chtorr series.  As far as ranking my favorite individual book of any of the aforementioned series, I would have to say this is it.  (Surprised me too.)<br /><br />The funny thing is it took me a couple of weeks to really get into it.  I don't know if I was just in a reading funk or was having trouble getting into the story.  The start is fairly slow, so I lean toward the latter.  Once I made myself dive in 150 pages or so, I was hooked.  I guess I can thank George RR Martin for my patience.  I loved the SOIAF series even though it had painfully unnecessary branches (mandatory ones...) growing off of the great tree that is the series.  This is, on a much smaller scale, a similar style of book that tempts you to skip a paragraph or two so you can get to the point.<br /><br />This book is Harry Potter without the childish theme music.  It is Game of Thrones with a clearer path.  It is War Against the Chtorr without the didactic tone and stubborn author that may never complete the series.  Those that don't like the book don't like our protagonist, Kvothe.  I can understand why.  He's the cocky kid that everyone gravitates to.  Do you hate Tim Tebow?  Don't pick this up.  Kvothe is Tim Tebow with sound throwing mechanics.  Both were raised by great parents that destined them for their own type of greatness.  The only difference is ***SPOILER ALERT*** Kvothe's parents were brutally murdered and he raised himself for several years.  ***END OF SPOILER***<br /><br />I also think the critics lack the patience for this 800 page decathlon.  If you like to read something that, like real life, has some time between suspenseful chapters, you can complete this.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  Don't let me be the guy that made Avatar your top overrated movie by calling it the best movie ever made.  Don't go into this with expectations.  Just read it.  Avatar is a good movie, whether you say you like it or not.  You only disliked it because of the rave reviews and your need to disagree with society.  This is a solid read, even if you don't think it's worth five stars!
0810994739|5.0|a very good book to read to my son , my son loved it, he talks about it all the time
B001L51RQE|4.0|Imagine a rock and roll fanstasy in which one of the best voiced and most literate singer-songwriters around partnered up with one of the tightest power trios in rock, and throw in a jazz improv sensibility that makes it totally original... but wait; you don't have to imagine it, because it already happened thirty years ago.  And \\"Certifiable\\" is a fantastic reminder of the still formidable prowess and enduring influence of the Police.  A big fan of Sting's solo work since then, I had come to believe that he came to full fruition as an artist only after their breakup in 1983.  Listening to \\"Certifiable\\" makes me rethink that.  If you ever thought of the Police as little more than Sting's first expendable back-up band, this double live record goes a long way toward destroying that misapprehension. It reaches back well beyond \\"Syncrhonicity\\" and their 80s singles compilations to include several tunes from their earlier records that snarl and pop with that propulsive pop/rock/reggae amalgam that no one does better than them.  It also includes expansive versions of \\"Walking on the Moon\\" and \\"Roxanne\\" that may make you forget the original studio versions, great as they are. Copeland, Summers, and Sumner all sound focused, invigorated, prodigious, and intuitively connected with one another's complementary musical instincts.  And that's just the CDs.  The DVD is pretty great too.  If found myself counting the years to make sure that in fact a full quarter century has indeed elapsed since their heyday.  They both look and sound as if very little water has passed under the bridge. Maybe it's asking too much, but this whets my appetite for some new material from them. They were already certifiable enough to reunite, so why can't it happen?

B00A6CT012|5.0|I am in the process of decluttering and simplifying and greening my house and this book is great for inspiration, motivation, examples tips and recipes!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Easy mechanics good graphics, and fun. Great time waster. A little slow leveling and skills get expensive fast. The upgrades are nice and portion mixing is cool but overly expensive.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show, just started watching this season lots of action and very nice store line.<br />You will be pleased if you watch it.
0385349947|4.0|I was prepared to hate this book. I had been told it was more autobiographical spewing about how women should live the same way as this successful author and how the rest of us were all doing it wrong. Whoever got that impression obviously had not actually read it.<br /><br />It turns out I loved it! It was thought provoking, well written, and said a lot of things that needed to be said. It was nuanced. It acknowledged the many factors that come into our lives that we can't control (eg a sick or disabled child). I loved the discussion about mentoring ('if you have to spell it out it, it's not happening') and like most intelligent women, I strongly related to the section on Imposter Syndrome.<br /><br />I'm pleased to see a woman with influence speaking up about these things, particularly coming from Silicon Valley. As a woman formerly in tech, I experienced many of the same situations as those the author described. The aspect of the book that did make me uncomfortable, however, was the lack of acknowledgement of women entrepreneurs... I see that as part of the \\"jungle gym\\" rather than leaning out. Entrepreneurialship allows women to forge their own paths, and in my case, to integrate work and family and to make a difference in the world all while playing by the rules that you have created. More on that would have been great, but I realize that's not part of her narrative.<br /><br />Overall, I found the book quite enjoyable and I plan to pass it along to my college student daughter. I expect it will nicely spell out or summarize for her a variety of topics we have discussed previously - but she won't have to hear them from her mother.<br /><br />Also, if you enjoyed this book, you should certainly read \\"[[ASIN:B004Q3Q44S When Everything Changed: The Amazing Journey of American Women from 1960 to the Present]]\\" by Gail Collins. It's a bit of history that puts this book into perspective.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I bought this with amazon coins and its great !!! I read comments that said things like &quot; This app sucks &quot; But i think is the greatest app ever .Totally recommend it any age
B009UZLRJE|5.0|We just discovered this program on TV and loved it so much we decided to order the first five seasons and watch them in order. I LOVE the outtakes and specials that come with it.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Great historical piece.  Probably staged, but some great moments.  Muddy Waters is priceless, fully in command, and the Stones play homage to him.  Highly recommend.
0786958731|4.0|If you are an RPG player of D&D who loves story and creativity that Role-playing brings, look else where. If you are interesting in a solid boardgame system with a nice setting, good production quality and overall fun play for kids - this dungeon crawl is worth it.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|My son was thrilled to get this for Christmas.  He is a big Tim Burton fan.  He loves this movie!
030759565X|5.0|Wonderful, easy to follow recipes written by a delightful and imaginative women.Her blog is also fun and informative!<br />Check her out.
B002RKSZS0|1.0|I LOVE Jane Austen's work, my three favorites are Sense & Sensibility, Pride & Prejudice, and Emma. I was expecting a thrilling story from this. Catherine was in Bath for the majority of this book she didn't actually get to Northanger Abbey until chapter 20. Its very slow moving even listening to the audio of this.
B006M4F67A|2.0|I have several of these 24-7 Mahjong games and they all have been decent. This one is fine as well, however it seems to crash after a few minutes of play so it's unplayable.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the quick access to the weather each day.  Helps to plan how to dress for the next day.
0545265355|4.0|Bought as a gifrt for our tweener grandson.  He expresses his appreciation in monosyllables right now - but I think he like it.
B003Y2XI8W|5.0|Great CD - love all but 2 songs! I especially love Fader! I also think that downloading from Amazon is the way to go since it is in MP3 format not the protected MP4 thru iTunes.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is one of the best Hard SF stories I've read in a long time.  It has the sense of extreme realism and accuracy that makes it seem more like a non-fiction narrative of a real event than a fiction tale of a future that has not yet occurred.  Well written and engrossing and not to be missed!
B002ZBN13A|4.0|The product arrived as described in the perfect condition. I would buy from this seller again. The process went very smoothly and I didn't even have to worry about the product.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|My whole family loved watching this.  It has a great soundtrack and wonderful graphics as well as a great story.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I've played Bejeweled 2on the Kindle and though they've very similar Jewel Star just plays smoother n the different games are better too.
0061537969|5.0|Recommend this book to everyone!!  This is an educational book about many aspects of life, and the lessons learned in reading this book will stay with the reader for years.  Beautiful bookk.
B008MM9630|3.0|My game keeps resetting which is annoying, and there are some boxes that I need to purchase as a goal but I can't find them. Other than that it is a pretty good game.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|With the way A Storm of Swords ended, I expected some great drama in this book. While there were some moments here and there, it seemed mostly like a bunch of behind the scenes conversations. Just not as exciting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun to play. It's nice for people that can't have real horses. I can play for hours. If you like horses you should get is game.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|I read this book because I loved the authors \\"Citizen of London\\"  (which iI highly recommend).  She has a way of making this era<br />of our country's  history read like a fascinating novel, not to mention an insight into the personalities of the<br />key players.
0142001104|5.0|Although religion is not mentioned in this book as a specific factor, real life observations and resulting positive results that are very &#34;possible&#34; point to the goodness all around us.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I did not see the movie so I had no idea what was coming.  I did not get it until the very end and then I spent a lot of time thinking about it.  In the beginning you say &#34;What???&#34; and then as the story evolves you begin to go with it.<br />It is one of those stories that haunts you and will me for years,like  &#34;The Poisonwood Bible&#34;. Not a piece of Fluff.
030758836X|5.0|This book is the antipathy of a predictable Grisham novel. I'm sure there is a movie in the near future.
B008EKMB82|4.0|Ruth Ozeki ties together mystery, meditation, and historical fiction beautifully in this novel. It was thought provoking and inspiring; I couldn't put it down!
0425252868|5.0|This is an incredible story and well written! I love Second World War history and this is an unexpected story.
B00631HASU|5.0|Well, well will wonders never cease.  The first time EVER that I have EVER gone through all the so that :-)) I can leave a review.<br /><br />Amazon you are so close to being 100% on this game I almost gave it to you but you know how petsnikety the universe can be about stuff how it is almost impossible to cheat on the old broad.  Well just between you and me I was able to fudge slightly.  Oooooooo now remember mum is the word here.  When I was coloring in your rating stars I colored ever so lightly, and technically gave you 4.5 stars but it looks like 5 hehehe.<br /><br />Truth is Sparkle HD is so close to  being a Luxor game.  It truly is a Luxor game except it is called Sparkle and not Luxor.  Well in all honesty there are a few things that Luxor has that Sparkle HD doesn't, I just almost cried.<br /><br />I know you have noticed how circumspect and restrained I have been and how I have only mentioned Luxor 46,976,563 total and well a real nice gift to a real nice and devoted AmaZon customer like me would be a for true life  gift of any Luxor game, except for Luxor slots game cuz they pretty much suck.  No offense intended  but that Luxor slot game just out &amp;dwand out bites the big one.  So dear AmaZon could you see kwhat you could do please.  Sorry if I come across alls
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Love this product, works so nice, Kindle Fire HD even knows when it's closed and powers down.  The tilt function is great and I love the way that you can prop the item open in either landscape or portrait mode.  So much nicer than I thought it would be!
B00B4804KS|4.0|I really thought this movie would make the most of 3D effects be we were left a little disappointed. 3D was only so-so.  Opportunity missed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely amazing book. Finished this one than purchased all the rest of the series and read them in a week. That's all I did for that week, as I had to know how it all started. Fascinating and I'm now a huge fan of Hugh Howey.
B0064ORVCQ|5.0|Saw this movie in 3D at the cinema and own the regular Blu Ray version. 3D wins hands down. Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a little bit boring but it's setting the scene for Part 2.
B008PSPNFG|5.0|For the longest time I have tried to \\"force\\" myself to like Steve Vai's albums, until one day I just said screw it and pretty much just abandoned the prospect of ever really enjoying vai. So much of what he does is very \\"out there\\" and I have never really been able to get into him fully besides a few songs here and there. Well, I am happy to say that the day has come where he has created an album just for me in the Story of Light.<br /><br />This album feels so inspired and accessible. A perfect combination. Each song is diversified and engaging to the point where I pretty much enjoy the entire album from beginning to end. To anyone who has ever struggled to get into Vai's music, I would recommend starting here.
B006671NPM|5.0|Saw this movie in 3D at the cinema and own the regular Blu Ray version. 3D wins hands down. Great finale to the series.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I saw this movie 3 times in the theater! This is my absolute favorite movie! It's so brilliant! So so so good!
B000068PQ7|3.0|Good cd, this artist should have received more attention, great haunting voice and lyrics, but this is not Dylan and is unfair for the comparison, wish the egos and other choices in their time would have allowed the original Byrds to stay together.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|I loved reading this work almost as much as Pride & Prejudice! Emma is so endearing & through her flaws you can see your own! I attempting reading Jane Austen in my late teens & couldn't get past the language but I have since read P & P 3 times & now Emma on my kindle app. The only flaw is the sometimes too long reflections from Emma that I was forced to skim through and turn the page to move forward. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed it!
193700788X|1.0|I was introduced to this series earlier this year by a coworker.  I rushed through all of these books (and short stories) in less than a month and was SO excited to see how it would all end.  While the quality of the series did seem to decline over time, it jumped off a cliff with this one!  I was confused, bored, and dissatisfied throughout the ENTIRE book.  I kept waiting for something exciting and intense to happen, but the writing, plot, and characters were all *insert sound when your character dies in an old Nintendo game*.  I agree with all of the statements made by other readers who were confused by the lack of continuity of the characters' personalities and the way previous important events were either ignored or briefly explained away.<br /><br />What does it say about a book when you are more excited about a washing machine being delivered to your home, and despite having less than ten pages left in said book, you forget all about it until you crawl into bed and see it on your nightstand?  Furthermore, what if you then become irritated to realize those pages are still unread, yet obligingly finish anyway before wishing someone would glamour you and erase all memories of that day, except the washing machine?<br /><br />I almost wished Sookie had been killed off, because then I wouldn't have to pity her psuedo-decision for a hum-drum, lackluster future.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This movie totally earned the Academy Award it won for best animated film of the year. This girl is my kind of character: feisty and brave. The animation is truly amazing as is the landscape of the 11th century Scotland in which this film takes place. But this film has a truly important message: no matter how much we fight, love will never break. And in order to truly understand someone, we have to see things through their eyes and give them a chance to explain their side and just listen. As well as that wishing for someone to change is truly a huge mistake. This movie is just beautiful. I can never resist happy-crying every time I see the ending, for the emotion is flawlessly displayed. The soundtrack is also just breathtaking. I have become obsessed with this movie. Merida is truly unlike the other Disney princesses, for none of them are as feisty as she is. This movie is perfect for everyone
B005QN3ANK|4.0|I expected more of the signature, unique sound Aqua gave us in the 90's.  This album is good, but it's very generic nowadays.  Some fun songs to dance to though.
B00A83075M|5.0|Just saw this movie and I realized, \\"Wow, no wonder this was the competition against 'Brave' during the Academy Awards.\\" This movie is really cute, hilarious, and heart-warming. But it's got an important message that everyone should know: All it takes to be a true hero is to just be yourself. And that message was displayed in one of the most creative movies I've ever seen in a long time. It teaches us that we don't have to change who we are just to be a true hero. I definitely recommend this for everyone!
B00B5NXBZ2|5.0|I have never had an album that I have rated every song 5 stars but this one, I have.  It's just beautiful, exciting, full of deep emotions, and just overall extraordinary music.  Amazing, unique music.  I'm more than happy with my purchase.  Worth every penny, if not more.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Fun game. Wasted many hours on this happily. Pretty straight forward and self explanatory. Graphics are great. Didn't,t regret this purchase.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This workout is really difficult, but I was seeing good results in 4 days. I hadn't lost weight, but I did gain a LOT of endurance.
B002ZG975Q|2.0|Now I read the book and then watch the expecting it to actually be good..... I COULD NEVER BE SO WRONG first of all if you never read the book or you havent seen the movie here what the movie is about so this boy named kyle messes with this witch and to get back at him she puts a curse on him  that makes him as unattractive on the outside as he is on the inside and he has a year for someone to love him or he stays ugly forever. So lucky I got the movie from the library and didnt buy it so here are my 3 reasons not to get it 1 its not realistic 2 the story line is terrible 3 and you can expect EVERYTHING I do not recommend this movie to anyone.. Ever.
B0078ZTWP4|3.0|too small a lamp. maybe ok for a small tent.<br />I had to return it because it was too small for the<br />purpose I needed it for
B00296A4F4|4.0|Season 1 showed a good start to a new type of show and it just got better from there.  The cast clicked together and the magic just got better.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|downloaded my book very quickly.<br />It was easy to page thu the book<br />it made it easy to read my book either on my laptop<br />or my galexy
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is the first book I've read from the Jack Reacher series.  It was suprisingly good.  I usually go for more action & story but the way it was written I couldn't put it down.  I will be reading another one soon.....
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It took me to a place I have not visited & talked of a culture different from mine<br />I would recommend it for anyone that enjoys to read.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This movie was really cute!!! I loved the Sandman character! I love the idea that all of these legendary characters from childhood would know each other. It's a great movie for adults as well as kids.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|If you're looking for a quick, run out the door bag, this is it!  Would recommend to anyone with a DSLR camera.
B003FSTN52|5.0|I think Julianna warms this 74 year old heart. I enjoy her acting and the wasy she expresses herself. I want to own all her shows.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was the best of the series. There's lots of things different in the movie and the book. But the book was still better. It had lots of detail and was very exciting to read. It was a real thriller
B009NY43NY|3.0|*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br /><br />I like, I assume all other reviewers, have read the entire Sookie Stackhouse series. Upon learning this was the last book, I shrugged and really thought it was about time. I remember not sleeping for well over a week straight as I read the first books in this series. It has been awhile since a Sookie book was as good as the beginning of this series. They were exciting and drew you into Sookie's world.<br /><br />Lately, the books have been duds. Once we got into the Fae and deep in Vampire politics, I was already yearning for this series to end.<br /><br />Probably because it has been a few years since that sleepless week of reading about Bon Temps non-stop, I overall did not mind this book. The author did go out of her way to tie up every conceivable loose end and visit with any character worth noting within the series. You can imagine that it was a lot within one book and felt like it.<br /><br />I, like everyone else, was an Eric girl. Shower scene, Book 4. Need I say more? But lately (i.e. the past few books) Eric had been getting on my nerves. It was easy to see the break-up coming and I accepted that. Plus, their relationship had so many problems I couldn't foresee it lasting. I was somewhat happy that Sookie ended up with Sam. After all, you date the bad boys, you don't marry them. Could there have been more development with the two of them? Of course. Could the trailer scene been improved upon? Absolutely. But it also felt right that Sookie ended up with Sam.<br /><br />That being said, I feel like it wasn't really an end. I found myself yearning for a flash forward chapter of Sookie and Sam surrounded by grandbabies. Maybe that would have shown why she went the way she did.<br /><br />It was time to end this series. This wasn't the best way to do so, but it wasn't the worst way either.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|I watch a lot of movies, and as such, thought that I had seen most set-ups and plots.  Not so with this surprising indie-gem, with the unforgettable ending.  I've seen the sequels and enjoyed them too, but not nearly as much as this original.  Definitely a title to own!
B00594XOZU|3.0|This app is really good and its better than the other free texting apps like text free I love this app kik me @paradise123
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This video is worth owning for the visuals alone.  Truly stunning, seamless, classic compositions, outstanding.  My only concern was with the dialogue-audio track on the 5.1 surrounds.  Seems to be lost at times under the rumble of effects and the pulsing music score.  Had to rewatch a lot of scenes to catch the dialogue, unfortunately, but I'm a perfectionist!
B0097K21YW|4.0|I'm actually not a huge fan of the Angry Birds franchise - I got bored really quickly with the repetition of the game.  I enjoy this one overall because, well - burning stuff with fireballs is kinda fun :)
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Oh, how I wanted to love this version of Les Miserables; after all, check out the amazing cast, production team and promotion!  But alas, despite epic production values, the non-stop singing and emoting left weary, unengaged and anxious for the end.  Some performances were downright melodramatic at times, with the emotions crewing up the screen, angst in tow, dirty faces abounding.  Almost like a cartoon.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this case- it works perfectly! It is exactly what I needed- fits perfectly, screen protector worked and went on well.
B001EC2ISA|4.0|Still holds up well after all these years. Don't watch with young kids because of the innuendo and F bomb from Keaton.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|My nieces love to watch this movie..They wore out the last copy they had so we got them a new one..I am sure they have watched it a dozen times since receiving it in the mail..
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show grew and grew on me as it progressed. It took the characters places I never expected and did an amazing job of making everyone conflicted, likable, hated, and human all at once. Kept me guessing most of the way. Can't wait for S2.
0312379293|5.0|ADVICE: DO NOT READ THE SYNOPSIS! I was glad not to have read the plot summary ahead of time---as is true for so many of them, it gave away too much.<br /><br />It is rare for me to bestow five stars on a mystery/thriller. Contrary to what the low-star reviewers maintained as too blatant borrowing from pieces of classic literature, I thought the author pulled it all together in a well-developed storyline.<br /><br />Author Archer creates well-drawn characters: the main one, Danny, is extremely sympathetic, and there are several in the love-to-hate-them category.<br /><br />There are already so many reviews of this book that I will make only a couple of what might be considered mundane observations:<br />~I thought it presented an excellent picture of British legal proceedings, foibles and all.<br />~It possesses cricket analogies which continue to baffle many Americans although it's easy enough to get the drift.<br />~It is a pleasure to read a hardcopy book for a change since they routinely have better much editing than ebooks.<br />~How could anyone not fall in love with the elder Redmayne?<br /><br />Lastly, I thought the title particularly apt and enjoyed the reference at the end: \\"They are both oaks even if planted in different forests...we all suffer in our different ways from being prisoners of birth.\\"
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|As a first book in a series this holds a lot of promise. It is aimed more at young adults but all ages could find it an enjoyable read.<br /><br />The story throws you in at the deep end really when, right from the first page, Owen, our hero, falls unconscious in the medical rooms at Easton Falls University, where he is just starting out his freshman year. While out cold he finds himself transported to the world of Everville, where he meets the Keeper, who tells him of a threat to the land.<br /><br />In short time he is back in the medical rooms at EFU - no time seems to have passed. From here there is a lot more to-ing and fro-ing between our world and Everville, the nature of the threat is explained and Owen's friends - Dante and Anika - become involved.<br /><br />At times this seems very much like Harry Potter for the slightly older generation but that is not a bad thing.<br /><br />On the negative side, it did feel a trifle disjointed in parts and the revelation of the 'bad guy' towards the end felt a bit tacked on but, on the whole, this was a good read and I will be looking forward to the next in the series
B0087HT36U|5.0|requires thought and creative thinking using cause and effect while setting boundaries and limits. nice variety and very entertaining. a fun game for all ages
B008ZOHCKE|1.0|Just did not like found other notebook apps that were better. Useful for some but not for this user. No problems with graphics.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|I love this slim armor iPhone 5 case!  I got the tangerine colored one and I really like the contrast in black and orange color on my phone (which is black). It feels solid and fits my iPhone 5 perfectly. All my cords fit into the phone (using the cords that came with the phone). I don't know about any other 3rd party cords. Haven't needed to use any. I like the slim armor because I like to put my iPhone in my pant pocket. Otter boxes are too bulky and ugly for my tastes. I needed something that didn't add too much bulk to my iPhone and the slim armor is perfect and looks very nice. Get it!
B0056CUZRA|3.0|A quick and easy read, very interesting from an historical point of view and also the characters say a lot about human beings. However some of the co-incidences were a little too much for me to believe.
B00AA0U046|5.0|Places like this are easy to review. What more could one say outside of the stars. Product was delivered as advertised and for a great price.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|I love the Traveling Wilbury's.  When my cassette was worn, I purchased this as a replacement.  Love it.  Thanks alot!
B00AYHKOZU|5.0|Places like this are easy to review. What more could one say outside of the stars. Product was delivered as advertised and for a great price.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm not one to get into all the faults the author has and all that. This was a book I enjoyed, plain and simple.. I will probably be reading the first one again just to refresh my memory.. can't wait until Entwined with you hits the shelves.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game offers several different types of games.  There is the usual match game, and the hidden pearl component is fun.  The bonus games are fun too!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Really enjoyed it. Surprising well written and acted.... loved the music and surprises.....the horse and rider face bag scene is worth the price by itself
B0054JZC6E|5.0|THIS. GAME IS SO GREAT CAUSE. IT HELPS KIDS. LEARN A LOT AND I MEAN ALOT IT HELPS. KIDS LEARN AND  WHILR THE KIDS ARE LEAFNING THRERE HAVING FUN AT THE SAME TIME
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a great game of awesomeness. You should with out a doubt get this game, is is so awesome in every way except it is tricky to get gems, a minor problem. Worth it, since it is free, and you should get it if you like zoo story, they are almost the same except on dragonvale you raise awesome dragons instead of animals!!! definitely get this game!!!
B002SSUQFG|2.0|As the title says: I am ten months into owning this watch and it has ceased to function. I haven't damaged it in any way -- not even a scratch -- but then one day the weight at the back that winds the thing started making an unusual amount of noise and the next the watch no longer goes. I'm letting the thing have two stars because it was a nice watch for as long as it lasted and it's always possible I just got a bad one.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really liked this book...the characters are very real and Hoover does a good job of developing the characters and relationships.  I found it hard to put down by about midway through the book.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This is just a cute movie all the way around great for kids and adults. It will definitely make you laugh
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Visually, the film is magnificent. CG tiger moves better than real. Some amusing humorous bits were left out as were some of the ghoulish horror.
193700788X|4.0|I've read every novel in the Sookie Stackhouse series and this was a fitting conclusion.  Lots of loose ends were tied up, we got a last visit with many beloved characters, and Sookie's future is looking brighter than it has in the last few books.  I always thought things might turn out this way, and I wasn't disappointed.  It's been a great ride, and I will miss Sookie and all her friends.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Do you want to laugh out loud? Tina Fey's self-deprecating humor in Bossypants allows me to see into her world of outrageous fellow comedians and their misdeeds.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I think this is one of the best albums Stevie Nicks has ever produced. I highly recommend it for newbies and fans alike!
B008RV5K5E|4.0|I have to say that I was surprised that Peter Weller was doing the voice for Batman in this movie, but he fit the part well, and the movie itself was pretty good. I am actually looking forward to seeing part 2, partly because of his gruff voice continuing on as Batman. For any Batman fan out there, this is worth buying.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love the book it was amazing the book better than the movie and I recommend this book to many people
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the book I cried I laughed but not very much.<br />I cried the hardest when Finnick died. AWESOME BOOK.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I loved it the special effects are awesome. the sound effect are really creepy and they made my skin crawl. great job!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I saw The Piano Guys on a PBS station and couldn't get their music out of my mind so I had to order the CD.  I enjoy listening to their music while I'm driving.  I would love to see them in person.<br /><br />Lady DI
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Best part imagining `Leroy ` into the duat by Carter. Also the title of the chapter Leroy meets the locker of doom. Hilarious!
B001N1DPDE|3.0|The BK2 is an absolute beast in terms of taking abuse.  I can't add much more than what has been said about durability.  For me, this knife is not for delicate tasks.  It feels large in my medium sized hands and I while I can perform tasks like gutting a fish with ease, I cannot make precision cuts easily without fear of making a mistake on the task or (worse) slipping and cutting myself.  I live in the Pacific Northwest and the handles are very slippery when wet.  Overall, this knife is just a bit too big and imprecise to fill the role as a true multi-purpose tool.  Coupled with the weight, this literally is too much knife.  Still, it's a good value for high quality steel and this knife comes along camping for processing kindling and wood so it still has its place.
1932735410|4.0|The PMO recommended this book as being useful beyond the exam as I am not a project manager and don't plan on taking the exam.  I do manage small projects for the business unit and this book has been helpful in understanding how to manage risk as related to scope, cost,  and time.

193700788X|1.0|I've finished reading \\"Dead Ever After!\\"  It was GOD AWFUL!  I refuse to get into all of the grammatical, plot, characterization, and dialogue issue; the good thing about the book (if you could call it that) is that the series is ended.  I'm not sure who to be the most angry with - Ms. Harris, her attorney, her publicist, or her editor (if you could call her/him that) - each of these deserve partial blame (not not credit) for this UGLY WORK!<br /><br />I do understand wanting to be finished with the Sookie Stackhouse series - but at what cost.  A loyal and devoted fan base who diligently followed the work of the writer - however, to end the series with the last two works is just plain dreadful, embarrassing, and amateurish!  God!  Such a waste of talent - to have the series end with this pitiful example of writing.<br /><br />My advice to any reader considering this work - DON'T!  Save your money and your time . . . AVOID THIS PITIFUL EXAMPLE OF WRITING!
B009MYARIK|4.0|Love the characters. Love how the author incorporates travel into many of her books.a light read, perfect for the beach.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I loved the books, so I decided to order the films. I am not disappointed. It would have been nice if there were more behind the scenes features. It would have been nice if there were less ads for other Warner Bros. films. Whatever,,,it is still Harry Potter.
B005HSL626|4.0|i TOOK MY GRAND KIDS TO DAVE N BUSTERS AND SAW THE GAME THERE., PLUS IT WAS ON THERE PHONES. THE GAME  WAS FUN TO PLAY
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Director Shane Black (Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang) took a screenplay by Drew Pearce (No Heroics, Pacific Rim) and himself and made a fun romp of an adventure in this third film of the Iron Man franchise. It comes complete with a simple premise but a few plot twists that will definitely surprise you in the beginning, middle and the end.<br /><br />Most of this incredibly fun adventure is due to the magnetically charged personality that is Robert Downey, Jr. (Sherlock Holmes, Due Date) as Stony Stark. He is the genius billionaire with the alter ego known as Iron Man who seems to do things under his own agenda, whether anyone likes it or not. His relentless deliveries of sarcasm, wit and humor toward almost everything about himself, his enemies and even his girlfriend, is nothing short of pure delight to watch.<br /><br />Yes there is plenty of action sequences, flying sequences and some pretty impressive special effect sequences, but the heart of this film is his dedication and love for Miss Pepper Pots played even more dynamically this time around by Gwyneth Paltrow (Seven, Contagion). The two of them on screen is nothing but a pure delight of electricity and passion to watch. And, Gwyneth is much more than his pretty `Girl Friday' in this film. Without saying much, she actually gets to wear one of the suits herself - what she does with it - look out!<br /><br />Now without revealing too much, Ben Kingsley (Gandhi, Schindler's List), plays an astonishing role that will literally leave you in a state of shock, as the key villain, or so we think, as he has something unusually strange about himself that is later revealed. Ben does an amazing job in this weird and yet offbeat character he was given to play.<br /><br />Don Cheadle (Crash, Hotel Rowanda) reprises his role as the `patriotic' vversion Iron man with a small chip on his shoulder. Scratch that, a large chip on his shoulder.  In this film he realizes the importance of what Tony Stark is doing and learns that everything is not always as it appears to be, especially in the face of danger.<br /><br />Now throw in a second villain, played artistically evil by Guy Pearce (Momento, The Hurt Locker) and you have a sadistically cruel and vengeful character driven film that literally will keep you guessing all the way to the end. This film sees tons more action and definitely more defined characters than in the second film of the franchise, which was my least favorite of the three.<br /><br />The movie is fast paced and heart-pounding with movement and incredible stunts and effect sequences. The artistry of cinematography and visual effects combined make it almost hard to believe we are not watching it as it `really' happens. Composer Brian Tyler (Eagle Eye, Middle Men) does an amazing score to compliment the entire film with orchestral strides of passion and action combined to make you hum some of the underscore.<br /><br />I personally feel the first Iron Man, although an origin story, still had more depth of story and character development and therefore still making it the best of the three for me. But this film is far superior in the humor and action department. You will literally be cheering in your seats for the finale in this film. Oh, be sure and wait for the credits to end, I have a strange feeling a certain group of `super' heroes are coming back soon.

B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Why not create an original story?  This film felt more like a fanboy's dream.  It was bursting with nostalgic relics from the old shows & films, but didn't contain much substance.  Peter Weller's role somewhat stole the spotlight from Benedict Cumberbatch, not in the sense that his performance was any better, but his side-story & motives detracted from the film's true villain:  Khan.<br /><br />Spock's Khan yell was a terrible decision for the filmmakers, and Kirk basically dying in the same manner as Spock (in The Wrath of Khan), ruined the film.  The dialogue during that scene was also very similar to the original film.<br /><br />Overall, the film was decent, not necessarily better than it's predecessor, but the blatant ripoff references from The Wrath of Khan destroyed any true appreciation for this new direction for this \\"alternate\\" timeline.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It's been such a long time since I've found a great fantasy to sink my teeth into! There is an underlying promise of magical and supernatural powers at work, but not so overt as to take away from the very human aspect of personal and political machinations for power and control. This is an adult, intelligent fantasy with very compelling characters. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.<br />By the way, I have never watched the HBO series, so I began reading this with no preconceived notions about plot or character.<br />My only complaint is that I can't see the maps on my Kindle Fire. I wish I could expand the view so I could get a better handle on what's where in the story.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I loved this book it is truly inspirational. Viktor Frankl is a brilliant writer and man I wish that I could have met him. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not as good as the books but entertaining.  Tom Cruise is too short to play Reacher, would like to see it reboot with a more convincing actor.
B00B4804KS|5.0|The film is so much more enjoyable in 3D. Really excellently done in great clear 3D. Very clean clear picture and sound. Totally enjoyable and immersive experience. Well worth adding to a collection.
B000IDCJK8|5.0|Very well done I really like Clint Eastwood a big fan. His start was in westerns and this is a classic if you like him. He makes the movie.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I liked this nicholas spark new movie. I have liked the last song, the notebook and of course a walk to remember. I surprised that this one was different because he usually adds death in his movies which makes it really sad but this one different from the others. I really liked it and was surprised by Julianne Hough's acting.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Very funny movie  well done and some fine actors in it put the movie across this one good for your collection. The second movie no bombed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Horrible book and not good book<br />Rather movie more than book  so sorry will not ever read it A fine.
B0004Z33F0|4.0|I liked the movie as part of the Rambo series but out of the first 3 movies I rate it 3rd. This was an Ultimate Edition with was a little corny with the interpretation of what the Russians were says at times which had no bearing or were not called for for what was happening at time on the screen.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|The game is nice, picture is cool. But sometime when it is loading it took forever. Or freeze on my kindle Fire. Have to delete the app and download again, lost all my credit.
B0026772N8|5.0|This book is definitely a must read for all Motorcyclists. This books takes you through tours of winding roads across country side areas with twists of drama, philosophy and mechanics.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is one complete fabulous collection. The packaging is neat, the contents well arranged and really appealing. It comes with 4 discs. 1 Blu-Ray of movie, 1 Blu-Ray of extra features, 1 DVD of movie and (the best part) 1 soundtrack CD. The Blu-Ray quality is excellent and it's treat watching or listening to the content across these 4 discs. Highly recommended if you have ear for good musical film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walkingdead is the best I ever saw on Tv I got hook to it seen it first show season 1 season 2 and now  season 3 all of them is awesome and I love all zombie movie but this beat it all
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I like it on my computer, BUT my kindle needs the update and I can not get it or don't no how to make it work! I like to play a game now and then and get kicked off! I thought the reader would fix it?
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Great action sequences, loved the music by Adele!  Fits in nicely with the James Bond series of movies.  Daniel Craig did an excellent job!
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man was one more exciting adventure with Mitch Rapp and company. To describe it as a page turner is much too mild, but Flynn certainly keeps ones' attention, cover to cover. The world is a dangerous place, and I'd really like to believe that we have assets like Flynn invents, just to keep the bad guys away. I wish Vince Flynn could write as fast as I can read!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Good story line with a mixture of humor and drama. Acting was great. Sorry that they ended it so soon.
0143034901|5.0|I read this book some years ago but re-read it recently and couldn't resist the temptation to add my two pennyworth to all the other hundreds of reviews. I mention only how long ago I first read it merely to explain why, for months afterwards, each time I visited a bookshop I went, in vain, straight to the Zs in the hope of finding another book by the same author. That's not something I do very often for any writer. Now, of course, it's even possible to find one. This is one of those near unique books that really hooked me.<br /><br />The city comes vividly alive - whether it's Barcelona or not scarcely matters it's so atmospheric. The characters are beautifully drawn and the twists are satisfyingly clever.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented on how the book crosses over genres and I couldn't agree more. It's part romance, part horror story, part mystery, part history and part deep satirical comment. You can't categorise it and that is, undoubtedly part of its magic.<br /><br />It's easy to say I wish more books could be like this but, even though I do, then again I don't, because it wouldn't be so unique.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the interface for this app. great job with this one. I check it all the time. I especially like the graphs of temp over time
030795062X|3.0|There's no question that Murakami is an excellent writer, and this book does give an interesting insight into Japanese culture. Some moments are also very funny.<br /><br />I struggled, though. It's basically a very drawn-out love story with plenty of angst. That this has to end in quite so much suicide is novel I suppose, but I found the central character, Toru, rather dull and passive. I guess he's supposed to be some sort of foil for all the female characters (who were far more interesting) but a fraction more personality wouldn't have gone amiss. I also found the sex scenes rather weird.<br /><br />I haven't yet picked up another Murakami even though I understand they're very different from this one. The problem I have is that I found Norwegian Wood rather an over-rated novel and I worry that his other books might be equally so.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|This story started off as one thing and developed into something else. It was very much a meditation on Harold's life and relationships and it was really about healing.  It also quite cleverly developed a by story on the growing public response to Harold's pilgrimage, a very wry reflection on human motivations and the use of the media / internet.  An enjoyable read with some very sad moments.
B006H5120E|5.0|I love my movie!! Titanic looks great on blue - ray 3d!!  I am looking for more good titles.<br /><br />Frances Gomez
B00B23O96A|5.0|I've been a Eric Clapton fan since I was  a youngin'  Ecric puts in some old school stuff as well as some cajun type music. He does touch on some really old stuff which I really did'nt care for but every cd has some songs that are real crappers.  Well recorded with great musicians. A great cd for my collection.
B00CDFWJIG|5.0|Initially I was skeptical about purchasing the movie but figured what did I really have to lose(except $15 or $14.99 to be exact.) despite being discouraged I purchased the movie and found it to be amazing. The movie contains romance, action, witchcraft, and several other exciting attributes. In my opinion it was definitely worth it !!!
B000001ESP|5.0|It is a great CD. This CD stands up to the test of time. I would recommend this CD to any one.

B001B51B9M|4.0|A timeless classic. The music is wonderful and easy to sing along with. The blue-ray format makes it nice too.
B001E75QH0|5.0|My hubby loved his gift. All of the movies are include, even the new one. I really made his day.
B007DIQC90|5.0|It came in an orderly time. It had a cardboardy type of case, instead of the plastic one. Much nicer, in my opinion.
B0097K21YW|3.0|This game is a slightly new take on the angry birds style siege games, and it is entertaining for a little while. However, it gets repetitive quite fast and feels like you are playing through levels just to complete them rather than for fun. Graphics are pretty poor, sounds are cute for the first 5 minutes.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I have played this game only and few time, and find it intertaining.  Hope to find friends to share with.
1439153663|5.0|A totally different view from the point of a white slave in the south.  Definitely a page turner novel.  The ending leaves room for another novel.  Recommend this to anyone who loves reading about the south, slaves, family dynamics.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I love this game it does kill my battery but it's way worth it! It also feels short but I'd rather have a good quality short game than a long unpolished one.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|This DVD is fantastic and it makes me laugh every time I watch it!  No problems with the product and the price was nice.
B000002OOY|5.0|If you grew up watching the Jurassic park series, there is nothing better than tossing on the soundtrack and hanging out. :)

B009JBZH54|5.0|It was as expected, I am not a &#34;Batman Guy&#34; so to speak but I enjoy the movies, great value as well
0143115014|5.0|This book not only provides difficult to find information on fragrances in general, as well as specific offerings, but fascinating insight into the industry as a whole.  The newer, paperback edition adds quite a few more perfumes, both for men and women.  While not everyone will agree with all the authors' evaluations, it is invaluable in a very narrow niche market on this subject.
B000JIHP88|1.0|The product is beautiful but it has some major setbacks, first it uses a lot of batteries, but the most important is that the mechanism in the mobile is very poor quality so after 3 weeks of use it stopped moving, it seemed like the little engine did not have enough power to lift the leaves, this is very disappointing coming from a major brand like Fisher Price.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Warning: This game could take enough time out of your life through fun and frivolity as to nullify all friendships and family.  Love it!!
B000MRA5EM|5.0|This is one of the best Imax movies I have seen.  The color is gorgeous and scenes of underwater life are amazing.
B0097K21YW|4.0|A lot like Angry Birds, only you try to destroy cities with a Godzilla like fire ball shooting dragon.  Although it looks simple, it is really challenging.  Takes some diligence to get some of the dynamite to blow.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I really enjoyed the selected cast for this concert. I would have rather seen this as the 25th anniversary of Phantom was done but the singing was outstanding enough I overlooked it. Hoping that for the 30th they record a full live performance of the musical.
1484051564|2.0|I felt as if this book was poorly written. Not all ages would understand or be interested. It is also very clear to see how the book ended and what the results were.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Could use a little more instruction on game functions.  Difficult to find and add friends.  Otherwise,  very fun to play and keeps me interested!

B006YM9JSW|5.0|This is a great CPU for overclocking ,even if it is not fully unlocked ,it will still overclock as high as any other do,due to the 1.25 ratio for the buss .My will do 5gigs but I have to turn the voltage up more then I want to ,and besides it does not need to run that high .I can keep it at stock voltage and do 4.3gigs just fine.It will do 4.8gigs with a little extra voltage for benchmarking.I used to run it like that 24 x 7 but see no reason to since it is fast enough at 4.3gigs.I do not know why people complain about a Fan and heatsink because all the factory ones I have seen are not that great anyway.You can also run it as a single channel or a duall channel or three channels or four channels.I think it is the best 2011 socket cpu for the money.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This is a great family movie. I do enjoy renting movies from Amazon. They have the latest movies for cheap. The whole family can watch for less than $5.00 a movie. Great money saver option!
B00136Q1I0|5.0|I love it when they put a greatest hit together, that they take the time to put you on a journey of this man musical talent.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Hilarious movie, that was unexpected. The actor and actress should have won a Grammy for their performances. Stay engaged so nothing will be missed. Enjoy!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This captivating novel had me reading under my desk in class.  In a society where if you are not perfect you are ugly, and it is almost imposible to run away, Tally is forced by the government to do just that…or be ugly forever.  I could not put it down and I highly recomend it to anyone.

B0064QNS62|3.0|This game is a little too complicated for my 6 yr. old grandson. He just was not interested in it right now. Will keep on my Kindle and maybe by summer his interests will change.
B007VTUYWW|5.0|I enjoyed the movie just a much as I enjoyed the game. Angelina was the perfect choice for this part.
0307476073|5.0|I received my copy of this book in excellent condition, also in a very short amount of time. I am currently reading it as we spend times at the doctors office for treatments. It's a great non fiction, fascinating account of one woman's struggle with issues many of us face. I may just have to hike this trail to find my own answers.
1594487154|5.0|I bought the book because I have some of the books of the author of this book before titled: Drive: the Surprising truth about what motivate us. This book truly portrays that all humans by nature are sellers. It is an excellent resource for students of marketing.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|With the usual 87th Precinct crew, focusing on Carella, this one presents the detectives with the mysterious serial murder of blind victims.  The question of motive is answered with a great twist, and this one works in an important bit of the Vietnam War.

193700788X|1.0|Eric Northman, strong Viking warrior - reduced to cheap prostitute.  Sookie goes from being the wife of Eric super-hot vampire sheriff to a permanent bar maid in nowheresville.  I am with everyone else.  I kept waiting for Eric to do something to change this suckfest of a book.  He probably got tried of her mopey, whiney butt.  Is Sookie a grown woman or an emo teenager?  I should have known it was going to be like this after the last book.  Ugh . . .
B009NY43NY|5.0|First let me say I really loved this book, and thought the ending fit well with the characters as I understood them.<br /><br />I started reading the Southern Vampire Mysteries a couple of years ago, and I loved them from the outset. I live in Shreveport, so it was always fun when they would mention places I knew around town.<br /><br />Up until this book, I was reading them through the library, so it was typically about 6 months after the book was released before I'd have a chance to read it, but given that this was the last book, I decided it was worth the money to go ahead and get it.<br /><br />***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br /><br />I know there's been a lot of uproar about the ending, and people saying it was terrible/poorly written/etc. I DISAGREE! I could tell Charlaine Harris wrote the best ending she could for the series, and I loved it. After many books of Sookie sort of throwing herself into relationships (which is the impression I got with Bill, Eric and Quinn) it felt like she was finally growing up when she told Sam she wanted to take it slow. I liked the fact that the POV bounced around a little, and it gave us a little more to go on than just what Sookie could tell us. I think it gave the storytelling a richer feel.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Bubba didn't make an appearance in this book. He is easily my favorite character in the entire series, and I would've loved if he'd dropped by, just for a little wrapping up. Still, that's a small complaint.<br /><br />I liked Bill as a character, and Quinn and Eric, especially during their times with Sookie, but, as was revealed in her conversation with Eric, Sookie didn't want to be a vampire, and Eric always planned to ignore her wishes, and sorry folks, but that's just not a healthy relationship tactic. I'm personally glad she dropped him.<br /><br />As for all of the outrage over the ending (death threats and suicide threats? Really? You know it's just a fictionally story, right?) All I can say is this: after she took the time to DEDICATE the book to her fans, for being awesome and supportive, how dare you slap her in the face by acting so stupidly petty and childish. If you don't like the ending, stop whining and go write a fanfic or your own series or something. Or, ya know, just more on to some other series. Act like grownups instead of spoiled little brats. This sort of behavior makes us all look bad.
0062014536|4.0|My Thoughts:<br />I have been waiting to read this book, from the moment I read the last page of the second book in their series, Pandemoniem. I can probably safely say that many of us were in the same boat. Lauren Oliver definately has the art of ending her books on a cliff hanger down! And once again being a broke student I couldn't buy this book right when it came out, but luckly my library got this book ASAP and I read it the first day I was able to pick it up. Pushing some other books back on my TBR. OPPS :)<br /><br />What I liked:  There is a very interesting discovery in this book, which I will not go into for those you that have not read the book yet, but it really caught me by surprise and I really liked what Lauren Oliver did with it. I know a lot of people have not liked the ending to this book, but I actually loved it. Yes there a lot things that are left unanswered, but to me that is what made the ending so realistic. The back that were was no &#34;Happily Ever After.&#34; blah blah blah. And as a writers stand point, when there is no definite ending, it also leaves it open for a possible continuation of the story later on. I'm not sure if this is what Lauren Oliver was going with exactly, but hey I just wanted to through it out there. I also really liked getting to learn about Hana some more. She grew as a character for me in this book and I really liked seeing how the cure effects her.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like:  My biggest problem with this book was the beginning. After waiting for over an year after that an amazing ending to book 2, I kind of wanted Book 3 to pick up where it ended. With that same action packed energy and it didn't. You almost had to go through about 50 pages before anything was even really discussed about the big cliff hanger.<br /><br />But alas that is another series that ended this year.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|Barbra Striesand was brilliant as the sterotypical Jewish mother. Seth Rogan appeared to be bored. Really disappointing, but what can they do with a poorly written screen-play? Too bad, it had great potential to be funny. It just wasn't. They should have focued less on product placement and advertising and gotten a better script.
1451697686|4.0|Lots of good ideas here for reducing the trash in my home. It will take time to set new shopping habits,  but Bea's story and success give me hope and confidence. Read this book if you would like to help our planet, one home at a time.
193700788X|4.0|Originally Reviewed At: Mother/Gamer/Writer<br />Rating: 4.5 out of 5 Controllers<br />Reviewers: Heather and Diayll<br /><br />Diayll<br />Every trepidation I had about the Sookie Stackhouse series in the last book, Deadlocked, disappeared (thank goodness) in Dead Ever After. As a Super-Fan of this series, the final installment truly warmed my heart. It is by far, one of my favorites out of the thirteen book series because we finally get our headstrong Sookie back *yippee*! Oh how I missed her and her quirky self. And I can't deny, I was hooting and hollering the whole time. With every funny line and the return of some of my favorite characters, Dead Ever After rocked my supernatural world.<br /><br />Things are crazy in Bon Temps and of course, our heroine is in the middle of it all. Sookie has managed to make numerous enemies over the course of the last twelve novels and it's definitely come back to bite her in the arse. Now framed for a murder she didn't commit, Sookie must uncover which supernatural creature she's pissed off the most. But not only does she have many enemies it turns out Sookie also has many friends - friends who come to her rescue and band together to help uncover Bon Temps last mystery.<br /><br />Thank you Ms. Harris for bringing back the wonderful mystery to the series! The three areas on which I judge these books are the mystery, the romance, and character development. In the last couple of novels, the mystery has been a little bland and if you've been with us since the beginning the you know Harris's books are known for having an epic mystery to uncover - which usually leads to things being blown up, people dying, and s*** hitting the fan. In Dead Ever After, we see the return of the mysterious aspect to the novels. There is less, OMG-who-will-I-bang and more fun-loving lets-solve-this-thing, happening. I think this allowed Sookie to develop more as a character. Her love life for once was able to take a back seat allowing readers to just enjoy the whodunit. While somewhat predictable, it was still enjoyable. And it did contribute to my overall enjoyment of the audiobook.<br /><br />I know some people (fans) are going rabid over the ending. However, I am not one of them. I thoroughly enjoyed to story and enjoyed investing my time in Sookie. Although she may have made one too many mistakes and hasty decisions (and slept with way too many people), she is still the heroine that introduced me to Urban Fantasy/PNR and still the heroine I love the most. Do I wish there was more? Of course! Would I read it all again? You bet! Sookie in the end had to find herself. We all make mistakes and let our hearts lead us down paths we shouldn't be traveling. It's our job as people to let things go, move on, grow and learn. I think that's exactly what happened in Dead Ever After, Sookie came to terms with herself and decided what's right for her. And frankly, I couldn't be happier!<br /><br />My Rating<br />4.5 out of 5 Controllers<br /><br />Heather<br />I went in blind, refusing to read spoilers or the opinions of other fans. For me this series has always been way better than the show will ever become, but I started watching the show long before I picked up the actual series.<br /><br />With that said, I don't have years invested into the books, but I became hooked the moment I picked up my first Sookie Stackhouse novel, and read them straight through. For the past two years, I've picked up the books with increasing haste, and devoured them in a day. This time, I savored the story knowing it would be the last.<br /><br />We all have our teams, and I'll leave mine out. The story itself in Dead Ever After was excellent. We have the Sookie we've all come to love, with her quirky, laughable sayings. She gets herself caught up in a few messes, though they are never really ever her fault. But the most enjoyable, for me, was having everyone back in the same book. I got to \\"listen\\" as all the past favorites came together forone last final hurrah.<br /><br />Does Sookie get a HEA? Maybe she does, maybe it's just for right now, and we'll never know for sure. If you've fallen in love with crazy Sookie, and go into this book wanting to read her end, then pick it up and give it a read. This is her series as much as it is the author's series, and I knew that no matter what anyone else said (or thought) that I would read it for myself.<br /><br />My Rating<br />5 out of 5 Controllersr right now, and we'll never know for sure.

B0015XHP3Q|4.0|In the third movie, Rambo is living in a Buddhist monastery in Asia when his old friend Colon Trautman (Richard Crenna) comes calling. Trautman wants Rambo's help to stop Soviet oppression in Afghanistan. Our hero, however, has no desire to become involved in more violence. \\"My war is over,\\" he says. Trautman goes on the mission and is swiftly captured. Upon learning his father figure is in trouble, Rambo goes into Afghanistan and does what he does best, while an excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith sweeps you along for the ride.<br /><br />The Rambo movies generally involve the titular character going into a foreign country and taking a stand against the atrocities being committed there. Because of that, these films are serve to enlighten the viewer about bad things going on (or WERE going on) that they might not otherwise be aware of. In the case of Rambo III, it was the Soviet persecution of the Afghani people.<br /><br />And as I stated in my review of Part II, each Rambo movie shows us a different side of the character. In III we see how he is tired of fighting but nonetheless must come to terms with his identity as a killing machine. We also get deeper insights into his relationship with Trautman.<br /><br />When all is said and done, though, what you felt about Part II is probably what you'll feel about Rambo III. If you liked it, you'll like this. If not, this movie won't do much to change your mind. I happen to like it a lot.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is pretty fast compared to other games like it.  Its fun to play and almost instantly gratifying.  I like the fact that i can earn acorns and though it may be slower to build up than buying them, it ensures that those who don't have a lot of cash can still enjoy the full benefits of the game.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|I regret taking the time to watch this film.  The plot is weak and pretty much nonexistent for the first hour.  Very few laughs.  Lots of ugly family dysfunction.  Yuck

I would<br />be great if they made it for the kindles.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel Washington gives another top-notch performance in this flick.  Like most movies, the one downside is that it seems a bit too long.  There was some padding that could have been edited out.<br />Overall a riveting exploration into the life of a deeply flawed human being who gets caught up in tragic circumstances while doing the one thing he does best, in fact, better than anyone else.<br />You might not want to take a flight right after watching this movie!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It's a bunch of short stories about people surviving, dying,and killing in the zombie apocalypse. Really enjoyable and good to read
193700788X|4.0|I have to admit that there were times during this series where I felt like we were drifting.  Recently I read an interview with the author that said that she was a \\"pantser\\" ( i.e. didn't really plan in detail but rather went with the creative flow as she wrote) and this series really read like that.  I've also read other series from authors who claim a similar writing style and have felt that sometimes they \\"lost their way\\" too.  Sometimes the authors are good enough to make the little side trips pay off and sometimes they aren't.  In this case, I really feel like CH made the journey worth it.<br /><br />I really feel like a lot of the negative reviews were just based on Sookie's ultimate romantic selection.  If you didn't end up on the right \\"team\\" then you HATED the book(s).  But if you really think about the essence of the characters she created, if CH put Sookie and Eric together, it would mean someone was denying the deepest sense of who they are.  Eric could no more be happy with an aging human who really didn't want the vampire intrigue and who wanted to work at Merlotte's and sunbathe in her bikini than Sookie could chuck it all (and possibly her soul) and live the life of the vampire queen.  I think she was pretty sure that she was never going to be as important to him as she felt a \\"wife\\" should be and she was right.  Not necessarily his \\"fault\\"; just WHO THEY ARE.  So, to put them together would just be wrong.  Romantic, maybe.  But still wrong.<br /><br />I admire how CH brought all of the seemingly stray pieces she'd collected over the previous 12 books together into a semblance of order.  I enjoyed seeing some of the characters again, even if it did feel like just a \\"very special guest appearance by....\\" inserted so that we could check them off the list.  Overall, a satisfying wrap up.
B008K8VDPU|2.0|The ap freezes too often.  The tutorial that is supposed to be on on You Tube never materialized.  The sound is way too soft.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This movie shows how are fighting men and women. Recermend pt for all to watch.. Great movie to see enjoy it.
0930289234|5.0|when I bought the book I thought that it would simply be a carbon copy of the movie. but reading it it's so much more. It delves deeper into the minutemen and goes much further in terms of character development. The only remotely bad thing that you can say about it is that at times it feels a little scattershot, but still, it more then deserves it's spot in the top 100 literary pieces of the last centrury
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I really enjoy this type of movie. The action and story line is awsome.I recomend tihis movie for. all.to watch.

B002RI97IY|4.0|A great perspective on how to look at and conduct one's life.  So much of it made so much sense - one of those 'aha - I knew that deep inside somewhere' books.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I reall enjoy watching movies about Lincoln, would recomend all to watch. People need to know more about our history.
B008N9AAQ4|4.0|This is a great movie meant to be enjoyed in high definition.  The Blu-ray makes the movie quite mesmerizing.  I've always like Ron Fricke films because he takes an interesting perspective on different cultural view points.  No commentary just interesting scenes from from various regions.<br /><br />For me it has high re-watch value as I after I watched it the first time - I've had it on in the background while cleaning or studying and have enjoyed looking up to catch a scene or two.
0451232852|5.0|I loved following the different characters thru World War I, and I learned so much about that war. Hard to believe that WWII followed in so few years after all that carnage.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|good game<br />my husband can't stop playing it. Good thing he downloaded it to his phone now. I has my kindle back
B00AB7HESI|3.0|this game is okay but it freezes a lot and has glitches, sometimes you type something in the little box thing and it doesn't come out how you like it. if you don't know what I'm talking about you'll find out when you play it
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|I've never read the books that preceded the film - though I trust that they were of significantly higher quality than the flick.<br /><br />I won't go into great detail in this review as I don't really  need to. It is enough to say that the performances are extremely leaden. They feel tele-prompted. There's not a likable character in the entire movie...nor is there a despicable villain. It's all just hollow.<br /><br />Toss in the horrid, expository dialogue and the pseudo-entertaining, cliche action scenes and you have a pretty awful movie. I kept expecting it to get better, but it didn't.<br /><br />Seriously, one of the worst movies of its genre that I've seen in several years.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|It was cheesy and somewhat very predictable but interesting nonetheless, plus Cooper is hot! Check it out it isn't a waste.
B00BNWWUDY|1.0|this whole movie this girl is so sad for any reason she can find. its a joke. repeated attempts of suicide while crying and flashbacks of \\"good times\\". boring and lost me after her first wild attemt at suicide for no reason.
B005LAIGW8|2.0|Well after the first one what do you expect? Lol<br /><br />I watched this on a bored Saturday night so I could have something on in the background. The bar was set very low because I had expected this to be a miserable movie to laugh at. I was moderately surprised to find that this wasn't a complete disgrace but an okay flick to have as background noise.<br /><br />The acting is pretty poor and Nicolas Cage comes off the entire time like a dad trying to convince his kids he's cool. The dialogue goes from cheesy to just embarrassing, the script is shallow and boring and nothing really memorable is brought to the screen. Even the fight scenes between demons are boring. With so much material to work with they really seemed to go out of their way to do a half assed job.<br /><br />However, this movie gets so bad that it becomes something to mildly chuckle at and I'm sure it'd be even funnier with friends. It's filled with a grown man acting angsty and silly, one scene is of him staring into nothingness as he broods away to a boring soundtrack. His fight to gain control over his own body is really just him screeching and yelling random things that are suppose to sound intimidating but are really just laughable at best. I mean this line right here \\"You will tell me or I will eat your stinking soul!\\" ...really? That's what a demon of Hell is going to yell?<br /><br />This movie isn't good but knowing it wouldn't be it turned into a funny time burner. Though, as I wrote out this review and thought it over I'm going to deduct another star because it was really, really stupid lol<br /><br />I got this movie for free at the library and would pay about 2-3 dollars to own it just to laugh at again.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|My granddaughter (6 years old) purchased this game because she loves Nemo so much,  But once you build his home, there was very little to do and she got bored with it.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|funny new one liner's and plenty of action to keep u awake and laughing.  liked having the choice of a 48 hr rental.

B000026KGC|4.0|1968's \\"Book Of Taliesyn\\", the 2nd album by Deep Purple, a very strong album, but not as great as their debut.  Here are some of the tracks i really loved, \\"Wring That Neck\\", great instrumental, always loved this track, Jon Lord at his best.  \\"Kentucky Woman\\", a terrific cover of the Neil Diamond tune, a top 30 hit!  Rod Evans great vocal performance, Ritchie puts out a great guitar solo on this one.  The beautiful layered \\"Anthem\\", Lord is magnificent on the orchestra part, so 1790's!  Classical piece by the Purple on the reworking of The Beatles \\"We Can Work It Out\\", great organ work by Lord, the rhythm section of Simper and Paice are superb.  And \\"The Shield\\", great atmospheric tune, (kind of reminds of 1979 Joy Division), just my opinion, Blackmore tops here, Rod Evans vocals fit this one perfectly, \\"Papa smokes the pipe of a sweet and better life\\".  Not as strong as their debut, but still a excellent release.  Their self-titled 3rd album would come out in 1969.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The book was interesting and I didn't expect the ending.  I was a different type of book than I am used to reading.  I  like more of mystery.

B0043VDIAG|5.0|What an absolutley beautifully written book!  Love Nicholas Sparks' books! Cant wait to see the movie - hope it lives up to the book!
B00BKBCF38|5.0|For the most part, I feel like I am finding out about most bands' new albums about 2 weeks after they are released these days. I have a few theories on why this is occurring, and such is the case with the new Ghost album. I have had their debut since its release and I liked it well enough. It is a very solid album that really stands out for bearing an approach that comes from a blindside. A few friends of mine have stated that while this newest album has its own highlights, it is a regression from \\"Opus Eponymous\\". Initially, I sampled this album on YouTube to get a feel of how dire it was that this be added to my collection. As it turns out, \\"Infestissumam\\" was a crucial addition. One that I might be purchasing a second time since I appear to have denied myself the Deluxe Edition.<br /><br />There are a multitude of descriptions I can heap upon this record. One can say it is an evolution, that it is a pitch-perfect throwback to this era or that and so on. All of these would be accurate. For me, this album succeeds in being unafraid to incorporate outside elements while maintaining a jarring and nervy atmosphere throughout. In \\"Secular Haze\\", the main rhythm has a waltz-like pattern funneled through a very dark, macabre filter, providing the listener with a romanticized feel of the darkest recesses of Hell. It walks a tightrope between creepy and celebratory with masterful artistry. Fast forward a bit to \\"Guhleh/Zombie Queen\\" and prepare for a journey that begins as a love ballad and weaves a bit of a quasi-surf rock segue into a epic choral finish. The more that I listen to this entire album, the more interesting qualities and traits make themselves known. All of these elements blend together and attack the listener with a new, but not-so-new vibe that fuses blasphemy, theatrics, shock, horror and musicality, throwing a wrench into the machine.<br /><br />With approximately seven months left in 2013, I am ready to declare \\"Infestissumam\\" my personal Album of the Year. While Ghost clearly pulls from wells of eras bygone, this is a record that needed to happen. Even amidst the underground where I have always felt true creativity and innovation has festered, sometimes someone new has to make everyone take notice. At this time, the theatrics of Ghost has begun to garner some attention in the mainstream. With an album as diverse and strong as this, they also have the songs to keep the world paying attention.ar.

1567312373|5.0|Now that I have read it, can understand why people either love it or hate it,  This book is not for everyone.  I found it addicting.  Set it aside 3 different times but after couple of days, was drawn back to it.  Call it curiosity or the challenge to make sense of everything going on, or whatever, but i found it an entertaining book and will probably read it again several times to find what I missed the first time.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|The filter clips on easily and comes with a small loop you can use to hook the filter onto the GoPro in case you want to take it off.  The filter works great after about 15' of depth, so I wouldn't recommend it for snorkeling.  At depth, it does a great job of adding the red color back to your video and balancing out the images.<br /><br />One suggestion if you do get it - snap the cover on once the camera is submerged, to make sure there's no air trapped between the cover and the lense.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Even more depressing than the latest Hollywood film version I'm afraid. Sadly, this didn't convert me into a Victor Hugo fan!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|The mouse is great.  Very comfortable, well laid out.  You download the software and can alter the bindings for all of the buttons, including combinations such as Ctrl+4 or Alt+Tab or whatever combo you want.  You can even record a macro and bind it to a button if you wanted.  And for those vain folks, you can change the logo display color through the software - the LEDs seem to have an unlimited array of choices for you to select.<br /><br />The variable DPI settings is nice, as I can switch depending on how I want to use the mouse.  One of the buttons on the side, where your thumb would sit, didn't work great - it has to be pressed just right to work.  Luckily, it's not a button I'd see myself using often so I don't mind.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with the mouse and AnkerDirect is a great company to deal with.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie was not what my wife and I were expecting. It was better. Well acted, well written, well shot. What more can I say?
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game is awesome, great story line, great combat, great co-op, decent PvP( should be more level based matching.) Even lovely graphics. The reason why I rated a 4 and not a 5, okay yes this game is free to download and I understand you need to make some money some how(buyable content..) the only thing I dislike is the time you have to wait for upgrades or even removing charms( I understand you also try to make money to speed that up). But honestly with that small issue to the side, it's a fun game, easy to waiste hours on. Would recommend to anyone.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Just like the rest but funnier. It's challenging feeding two omi s. It's exciting to watch how far back he goes
B00A1OZBSQ|4.0|Reading this book was similar to consuming the foods it warns about:  after being enticed by its appearance and briefly stimulated, there was a feeling of unfulfillment.  After three years of research, the author presents behind-the scenes evidence that convenience food is, in fact, not good for you but is nevertheless ruthlessly promoted by corporate interests. Shocking.<br /><br />The extent to which government agencies such as the Department of Agriculture are influenced by food industry lobbyists may be eye-opening to some. Certainly the research along this line was diligent, and the details are recounted vividly. For me, the greatest strength of this work was showing the historical depth and scope of the convenience food industry in America. What disappointed me was that the focus on the engineered desirability of fast food seemed to come at the expense of in-depth analysis of why these foods are harmful, beyond their caloric contribution to the obesity epidemic. For example, the effects of trans fats are barely mentioned. The overwhelming use of fructose is addressed from an industrial perspective, but the evidence for its adverse metabolic effects is skimmed over.<br /><br />The final section on salt was unique in showing a successful example of how public policy changes can dramatically benefit the health of the population. This was the first time I had learned of how hypertension and heart disease have been dramatically reduced in Finland by government-mandated reductions in the salt content of processed food. If the book had concentrated on constructive information such as this rather than trying to sound like a lurid critique of corporate conspiracy, it would have been of been of greater value.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|I previously wasn't a Ben Affleck fan, but this movie has made a believer out of me. A well executed, gripping account of true historical events. I am happy to say Affleck has truly grown as an actor and director
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|I was in the mood for a fantasy movie, and this fit the bill perfectly. Thankfully I never read the book so was able to enjoy the movie in its own rights without constantly comparing it to a script in my head. It was entertaining, visually appealing, and a unique spin on a somewhat tried and true tale (odd family in small town and girl with special powers). I enjoyed the acting and the actors, though I didn't feel that much chemistry between the male and female leads. They weren't really a sexy couple, but seemed more best buddies who kissed here and there. When they did more it seemed off to me, but that's probably just personal taste. The movie itself was well done and I would love to see a sequel. If you're looking to be entertained, skip the book and watch the movie, or at least wait to read the book until after you see the movie, so you can enjoy both.
0316113506|5.0|Excellent book. It has wonderful information and helped me with figuring out my child. Would highly recommend.<br />Recommended by therapist.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book does exactly what is supposed to do, To pick your curiosity about Tesla and want to read more about it.<br /><br />I read it from beginning to end in one go and now I want to know more, I highly recommend it.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This movie have so many real and touching moments, and at the same time a bunch of funny and oh so real life situations. I watched it twice already, and will watch it again.
B0000A5A0T|3.0|I know I'm not alone in this opinion, but I don't see it represented among the current 202 reviews: Blue Train isn't a bad album, but it's overrated to the point of misrepresentation.  It doesn't quite stand on its own as a Hard Bop classic, and nor does it say very much in the context of Coltrane's own corpus.<br /><br />This was not a working band, and that's an unequivocal problem.  There are as many stylistic concepts as players here, and every one of the men recorded more confidently in other hard-bop dates with steady bands led by elders such as Monk, Blakey, Roach, etc.  Compared to classics like Monk with the Messengers, Deeds Not Words, and certainly Miles's discs from this period, Blue Train just doesn't have the esprit de corp and stylistic incisiveness.<br /><br />That might mostly be inexperience---both in the group and its notably young members.  But the compositions are complicated to the point of didactic here and that doesn't help.  It's a problem that Monk often had.  The band keeps up, but as often as not they fall to stringing together straight bop licks over the changes.  Trane didn't play licks, and was working toward sheets of sound already, so the compositions make sense under this Monk graduate.  But only under him.  The rest of the band sounds about half a decade behind.<br /><br />The form does too.  And in the course of things it represented an evolutionary dead-end for Coltrane.  This fact alone should attract the album more criticism than it does.  It was another four years before he let his crew grow beyond the focused laboratory of the quartet, (with the special exception of Dolphy) and there were only a few other occasions (in the summer of 1965) when he used more than two horns.  And then their purpose was very very different indeed.<br /><br />To be sure, there are a number of stylistically problematic albums in the course of Coltrane's development.  But this one is unique.  \\"Professional\\" is an aspersion in the context of the Coltrane discography and applies only rarely (and never after 1964, where most of the problematic albums are found); it applies here.  Many musicians are admired, but few can claim more than that: an intimate, deeply human connection with their listeners.  In this man's case that intimacy came from a unique combination of relentless self-criticism and an entirely unaffected utilization of music as a form of prayer.  Those elements really aren't in harmony here.<br /><br />The result is an academically valuable detour to a remote coast of Coltrane's music, or a Hard Bop footnote.  But for plain musical value I recommend two other albums: Traneing In, and Soultrane, which brace Blue Train chronologically. In these sessions Coltrane is both more comfortable (unsurprisingly given the company) and more typically experimental and searching.  And there are moments in the ballads on both records where he touches down on the glassy surface as assuredly as on A Love Supreme/Psalm.  These two discs are conceptually more simple, but a lot more personal and far more characteristic.  Soultrane in particular really should supplant Blue Train as the entry point to this great body of work.
B004EF65QA|4.0|I really like the movie. As always it never could be like the book, but it's the best you can get. I loved the actors, thay chose them perfectly as I imagined them, specially him, her and Mr. Higgins. I will watch it 100000000 times, like pride & prejudice.
B007REV4T8|5.0|My husband and I have been watching since the early 60's.  We really liked the action in this particular James Bond movie.  Times have changed but James Bond adventures haven't!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I read the book, and I think they did it prety good. I think it is difficult to put everything of the book in 2 hrs of a movie. As always happened with that is that you always compare them and I aways like the book most.<br />The movie was ok, but I imagined everything different.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I really purchased this movie for our grandchildren.  However, we watched and enjoyed it as well.  This was a good family movie all around.

B002QQ8HAG|4.0|This is a great documentary if you are into the craziness of fashion and some of the characters that populate the world. While Vogue doesn't hold a candle to the great magazine it once was, it's still the best of the fashion lot. Grace keeps up the standards for others to follow. Watching the perfect-looking Anna function is a revelation.
B0064QNS62|3.0|like the game alot, just hate the controls for the games. Makes it real hard to get to the next area, but I keep trying. I wish the Kindle had  a control you could buy to use in the games.
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|I chose the three star rating because season one has a place on one disc that doesn't work. Viewing of the second season is in progress now and should it have a flaw I will send them back. But hopefully that isn't going to happen. Season three has been watched by another individual and even though it has some scratches on the last disc it was o.k. The discs will not stay in place in the plastic case holder and evidently came loose in transit. Other than that they are good quality and good viewing. If I am allowed, I will review again after season two is watched.  :)
B00BHWG5C2|5.0|Previously had on cassette so seemed like time to upgrade to CD, especially with the bonus disc of BB King and Ike/Tina Turner.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The novel (as opposed to the movie, according to friends) highlights the dynamics of a failed marriage, a mental breakdown and a realistic solution to a troublesome family situation.  I believe it verifies that old axiom that we are best suited to a relationship with those who are on the same emotional plane as ourselves.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is an excellent work that is as relevant as any analyis of life today with insights into people, character, politics, world events, religion, philosophy, theology, and much more
B004P1JDJO|5.0|Great book to describe why we do what we do and what makes us react the way we do - as well as why others react the way they do.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Killing floor is a good read, and like most of the books in this genre is also a bit predictable at times. Still the book was good enough for me to buy the second book in the series. If you are looking for something that is a well put together book, and you do not want to have to think too much while you are reading, this is a good choice.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This item was bought from Amazon warehouse with a minor defect on casing. Beside the the case defect, there's nothing wrong with the discs themselves. The Blu-ray and DVD discs are in excellent condition.
0670026603|5.0|I read a review of this in the New York Times book review and took a chance in it. It's totally an engaging page turner. I've since given it as a gift to about 6 people and recommender it all over the place. Men and Women both love it. I don't really get why it's not on the \\"best seller\\" list. Makes me think the whole best seller thing is manipulated by publishers. This writer is British. What a book!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|i love the game,But I orders coins,and credits,and haven't receive them,But I do love the game,please send me my coins,and credits so I can play thank you
193700788X|1.0|What a horrible ending to a series I have loved for years.  I have never taken the time to write a book review, but this book was such an utter failure.  The writing was terrible, there were numerous continuity errors, everyone acted completely out of character, and the mystery was utterly ridiculous and boring.  I didn't recognize Sookie at all in the book. I don't understand why Johan Glassport, Tyrese, or Copley had any real reason for wishing Sookie dead. It was also ridiculous to bring Claude back yet again. Parts of it dragged while the ending was completely rushed. It didn't read or flow like any of the previous novels and I hate how much of the mythology was adjusted to fit this ending.  Everything just came completely out of left field and I was totally confused who these characters were and why they made the decisions they did.  I've read this series for years and loved it so much so I am totally disappointed by this clearly thoughtless ending.  It reads as though Charlaine was completely sick of this series and didn't really care how it ended, she simply wanted it wrapped up so she could move on to other projects. It was such lazy writing with a totally vanilla ending.  After several books of building up the fact that Sookie is a strong woman that enjoys her place in the supe community and doesn't feel totally comfortable with humans, she does a complete 180 and decides she wants the white picket fence after all.  What was the point of this journey for Sookie?  Just to get beaten up and decide she hates vampires after 13 books?  Why did Sookie even venture in the supe world at all? I feel like I wasted my time investing in these characters and their stories, which insults me as a reader.  I don't understand why she took the time to build such a relationship between Eric and Sookie to have them break up so easily in this last book.  I don't understand why Eric risked so much for Sookie throughout this whole series to simply act like a cold jerk in the end.It simply doesn't make sense.  Plus I hate the fact that he was made subservient to Oklahoma. I hate Sookie didn't even seem to care that her relationship with Eric ended, and she jumped right into bed with Sam and suddenly decided that she loved him. So suddenly after looking at him as friend for years she decides that she's wildly in love with him? I feel like I didn't get a proper ending for any characters, especially my favorites like Pam and Eric.  They barely appeared in the novel at all.  I also hate the fact that Sookie is now such good chums with her former rapist Bill.  It's one thing for Sookie to forgive him and move on, its another for her to turn to him with relationship advice.<br /><br />I'm also disgusted with Charlaine's attempt to demonize her audience and label them as \\"crazy\\".  I think it's clearly an attempt to divert attention from the fact that she produced a completely lousy piece of work for what was once a fabulous series. Thousands of fans invested years in this series and I think we have a right to be upset with this complete failure of a book. I feel like she strung this series out for years to make tons of money from her faithful readers and then wraps it up with an ending that would have been more fitting if there had been three books instead of 13.  This was my all time favorite series and now I won't ever read it again.  Nor will I ever read any new series that Harris releases and I'm sure I'm not the only one.
B009RH9FR6|3.0|The device difficult to keep engaged,both vertical and horizontal.  Quality is good, especially for a used item. Perhaps working with it some more will help.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I had read some spoilers before I read the book and I am glad I did because I was so disappointed in what happened. Characters that were the center of plot line were completely disregarded and cast aside. i bought the book because I was hoping the spoilers were wrong and because I just had to finish, but I will re-read them this summer and pretend this book did not happen. The writing was not as good as the first 11 books either, I don't know what happened with this book but the characters were very off and I hate what happened to Eric :(
B001OMJGD0|3.0|The CG was good. The acting was good. But, the script was...meh. The man of steel has moved on since the 80's, it is a pity that this film didn't embrace that.
193700788X|1.0|I loved the final books in Harris's Teagarden, Connelly, and Bard series. I did not like Dead Ever After. It just wasn't very interesting.  It was boring. Sookie was boring.<br /><br /> I always liked Sookie and her unique view of her world, but it seemed like her personality changed during her short time in jail. She was not the Sookie I had grown to love over the past several years.  I didn't like her anymore.<br /><br />Forget Bill and  Eric,  I think Sam deserves better.
0307389839|5.0|brilliant book by world famous Murakami...about running really..from his expertise into slow running, annual Marathon to run under 3 hours 45 mins (impressive)..to his 100K UltraMarathon experience..the runners' blue, the process, the learning, paradoxically with his writing life..such a relax book to enjoy..and his latest: Triathlon..Murakami on triathlon.
1451695195|5.0|For those who wonder if heaven exists, it does. And it is as close as one's own heartbeat. This doctor's experience made him  believer who will never doubt the stories told by people of their own near-death encounters. It's nice seeing someone who could write so well about it, not only from a doubter's point of view, but also as a clinician who couldn't dismiss what he saw.
0812993845|4.0|I am a Sophie Kinsella fan.  I don't read much fiction, but every now and again I just need a good escape.  I picked it up from the library on a Thursday night and finished it by Sunday afternoon, and still had pretty full days in between.  Like another reviewer, I was sick and read some here and there when I was unable to sleep.  It was entertaining.  Many of the scenarios in this book were a bit far-fetched, but not totally out of the realm of plausible.  I am somewhat impressed by how she comes up with so many different and wacky scenarios and ties them all together without leaving any loose ends.  The ending was fairly predictable, but there were still some surprises in how she got there. I wouldn't say that this is Kinsella's best book, but it is still a good read for a Kinsella fan or anyone looking to mentally check out for a while.  Don't set your expectations too high and don't pay too much to own it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book, it is wonderful and the thriller of the hunger games series by margaret collins. It is simply amazing.
0763621803|5.0|Like so many real-life little ones, Lola has a long list of foods she absolutely won't eat. Brother Charlie finds a creative way to get her to try new things by reassuring her that they're not on her &#34;no&#34; list: Carrots? No, these are orange twiglets from Jupiter! Mashed potatoes? No, it's cloud fluff from the pointiest peak of Mount Fuji! Sadly, the trick doesn't work at all for our own picky eater, but it does make for a cute and charming book. Lauren Child has a special way of putting things into language that feels just right for little kids, and this is our very favorite of the Charlie and Lola series. Highly recommended.
B009X00E18|5.0|Ordered one of these for previous Kindle Fire, loved it. So when we upgraded to the new Kindle Fire HD, we ordered another case.  Now my husband and I both have our Kindles and Marware cases.
0689835604|5.0|My one year old granddaughter loved flipping open the pages!  This book will be around for some time as she grows
043902353X|5.0|Happy Hunger Games and may the odds be ever in your favor!<br />I will do my best to avoid spoilers but it will be difficult.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Catching Fire is the second installment of The Hunger Games series and I must say that Suzanne Collins has done it again.<br /><br />Catching Fire is set a few months after Katniss and Peeta survive the 74th annual Hunger Games and are gearing up for their Victory Tour of the districts.<br /><br />Rebellion is brewing in the disricts, the 75th annual Hunger Games is going to be the Quarter Quell, and Katniss is struggling with the memories and nightmares from the year before.<br /><br />Review:<br />Overall I liked Catching Fire. It was good to see how Katniss and Peeta have grown since their time in the arena and even better to see how their relationships with those around them are affected by the events. The story is solid and Collins introduced us to what seems to be an excellent finale to the trilogy in Mockingjay. The story ends on a cliffhanger so I highly reccomend you go ahead and buy both Catching Fire and Mockingjay just so you have the next one handy! I made that mistkae and waiting is killing me!
B008XG1X18|5.0|A fun way to show self expression or just share fun pics, crafts, and fashions. Definitely an app worth purchasing.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|This product is a fun entertaining game but after a while it gets really boring but it is quite fun.
0061998494|4.0|This is definitely recommended if you are a fan of the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.  The sometimes agonizing details of his life and ultimate success make for a compelling story.  The book is written with much humor but does not sugar-coat the trouble he encountered on the way to becoming successful.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This was the final book and it didn't miss the mark.  Kept my interest just as the other two did. I wouLd recommend all three books for a look at life as it could become if people just follow and don't question<br />Myrna
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I bought this for my daighter who loves OmNom...but find that it is me who cant put it down! Well worth the ninety-nine cents. Im looking forward to new levels already!
B009NY43NY|4.0|Boy, how negative can people be?  I was expecting the book to be horrible, but I think Charlaine stayed true to Sookie and the rest of the characters that we had grown to love and hate.
0812983459|5.0|This is an exceptional journey we all should take at some times in our lives. It doesn't have to be an actual journey but one we could take mentally. A great examination of the soul.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|With powerups and treasure chests, this game is addictive.  Great way to meet new friends.  Gametime can be short, if you don't want to spend money on credits, until you can get teammates to send free credits.

B008476HBM|5.0|Very good. The best of its kind. I loved everything about this product. Writing this review is extremely stupid and time consuming.
B001KOFH2G|4.0|It's blu-ray so although its an older film the image is very sharp.  The story itself is a bit of a convoluted mess but still a fun ride.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Very good. The best of its kind. I loved everything about this product. Writing this review is extremely stupid and time consuming.
B003ELKNH2|5.0|If you enjoyed this film in the theater and and the VHS version of this film, you'll enjoy this version. Video and audio quality is well-done. DVD arrived promptly.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The best of its kind. I loved everything about this product. Writing this review is extremely stupid and time consuming.
B000M4RG4C|5.0|Clint Eastwood directed this along with the partner film, Letters to Iwo Jima. This film depicts the raising of the flag on Iwo Jima and the arftermath that follows the three sailors/soldiers involved with it. Overall, a great film for history and WWII fans.
B000UR9QGW|5.0|Truely Sam Ramis best movie. Anyone who loves campy horror needs to watch this! That's all you need to know Buy it!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Alien was a great horror film. Aliens, the sequel did a fine job of following up the horror. Aliens 3 was okay. Aliens 4 was more of a black comedy and moves away from the path the others took.<br />Nine (9) DVD's come in this box and each film has two versions for you to choose from, which consist of the original theatrical version, and the directer's cut version. In my opinion, Alien and Aliens both were better in the director's cut with some added scenes that answered some questions. Alien 3 was best in the theatrical version. The director's cut of it was way overdone in length which took away the horro element of it. Aliens 4 was all right in the director's cut.<br />Overall, the films are well done, and in this boxed set is great as a gift for the fan in your family or circle.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is such a great story, and the Blu-ray was only a few bucks more than the DVD.  Sound and picture quality is awesome on Blu-ray.  5 stars.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I grew up loving Rockin' Rod, ever since \\"Every Picture Tells a Story.\\"  I was nervous buying this CD because Rod is getting a little older (like the rest of us), but I was very pleasantly surprised.  It's a wonderful collection of music - both fast and slow.  I love the song, Pure Love.  It brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it.  Rod is a true gentleman with a huge heart and this cd proves it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I'm only half way through (and thus 5 stars might be premature), but so far I am enjoying this book as much as Follett's Pillars of the Earth - a top favorite of mine. He tells the tales of several different families starting at the beginning of the last century.  I am in the midst of WWI - told from the sides of the English, a Russian and a German.  I never really understood why so many countries jumped into a devastating war because of the assassination of arch duke Ferdinand in Serbia; now I do (although it is an almost incredible domino effect). Besides being a master story teller Follett researches the history and weaves it into the plot so well.  The characters are very true to the period.
B00003CXDB|5.0|Wall Street is a remarkably good looking movie. The mise-en-scène and mise-en-shot are irrefutably of a calibre that is well beyond that of the metteur-en-scène and puts Olive Stone firmly in the category of a movie auteur who provides the \\"rising tide that lifts all boats\\" (director's commentary).  The acting by Michael Douglas , Charlie Sheen, Terence Stamp, Daryl Hannah,  Sean Young  and James Spader is consistently excellent. The good guys win.  Bud Fox experiences redemption via which, and jail time,  he avoids the moral abyss. Gordon Gecko (bad-guy-in-chief) goes to jail.  And thus, on these levels, Wall Street is a winner on all counts.  However, upon reflection, this movie is the moral abyss.<br /><br />The only winner in this drama, is the government. Which makes Oliver Stone, a more skilful minister of propaganda, than Joseph Goebels or Vyacheslav Molotov. A master eiron, given Oliver Stone's  (self-propagated, for the most part)  popular image as a warrior against big and interventionist government.  So, where did it all go wrong? Well . . . It all went wrong at the time when Bud Fox chose to back the losing side. Instead of negotiating a better cut of the action with Gordon Gecko, over his change of mind about Blue Star Airlines, Bud Fox chose to double-cross Gordon Gecko. If Bud Fox had chosen more wisely, he could have walked away with millions, given his father a million or two, which his father, directly or indirectly, could have used to help out his buddies while they looked for other work.  But by not doing this, the Blue Star Airline workers were still out of job; Gordon Gecko and Bud Fox went to jail; the inherited wealth had fewer alternatives to make money, by doing nothing;  and the government won.<br /><br />To be fair, though, and as an irony in itself:  If Oliver Stone had wanted to make Wall Street as this kind of a more rational movie, it would probably have net with a very cool reception, at the US box office. Then again, the true auteur has a higher calling, than the US box office.
B004WR125O|5.0|Very happy with the product !!! It works great has a good distance fom my wireless system and it picks it up with no problem.
0307476073|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this book.  Makes me want to hike the PCT!  I laughed, cried, and went on a complete journey with Cheryl Strayed... :)
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I love this movie! All though the book tells more (as usual), the movie did tell the story better then most. I was a bit disappointed in how the movie differed from the book, certain things in the movie happened that did my happen in the original book. Great movie, fabulous actors & actresses! READ THE BOOK!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Just wish Connor Reed existed, nothing like a good book to make me smile. Fun book to read enjoyed it.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|as always, any Jack Reacher story is a favorite to me.  Someone else needs to play Reacher in the movies though-that would fit his description- physically anyway.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is Very interesting and fun. I recommend to all puzzle solving champions. I think it is worth the money.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Love the show!  Its full of drama, aliens, action, family, betrayal, and love. The characters are believable and you can relate to them. C
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|The combination of this CPU with a good SSD and you will have lightning performance. I haven't overclocked it yet, but I will in the future. The only downside is the stock heatsink. It is very little and noisy, but any serious consumer will use a third party heatsink anyway, specially if it is planning to overclock it.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Seems fun  some are a little light in color making it harder to see. Over all this is a good app.

B005RZ8W94|5.0|Volbeat is an awesome band-seen them in concert and they were great then too--got a chance see them -please go
193700788X|1.0|I've been a fan of this series for many years. It was a must read, stop everything to read series. I'm at a loss for words with this final book. I'm glad to see so many genuine reviews for this book, and their feelings are the same as mine. The characters were not the same characters I've been reading in previous books. The changing of world rules (Sookie suddenly can't hear Sam clearly when in previous books she could make out full sentences). Sookie enduring everything to end up exactly where she started in same town at the same job with the same friends. It's depressing, and I'm sad that one of my favorite series that I've read too many times to count and suggested to numerous friends ended so badly.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|If you are a fan of World War 2 spy novels this is a must read.,  This book was a real page turner and Follet is a fantastic writer The story centers around the exploits of a female Nazi spy who is totally ruthless and who will stop at nothing to  get vitally needed secrets to the Hitler regime before the D day invasion. Her information could determine the outcome of the War, The chase is on to find and identify and stop the spy before it's too late.The story builds to an an exciting climax,<br /><br />Even though this is a work of fiction I tend to believe that some of its contents may be based on real events,.
B006M4F67A|5.0|On my Kindle Fire (not HD) game runs smooth, very nice graphics and nice selection of games & levels to pick from.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|great cast.  great story.  violent as per all QT movies, but done in a way that i can tolerate for some reason.  i would definitely recommend this movie.  and if you haven't already seen his others, like inglorious bastards, pulp fiction, reservoir dogs - go back and watch those too!
B0067R0APK|5.0|I like the way I can compare my weather with people I know in other parts on the country. It is really fast and easy.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|there were definitely some funny parts, but it seemed to just drag on and get more ridiculous.  the way they spoke to each other was just terrible.  i guess if you don't have anything better to do go ahead and watch it.  for me there are definitely better ways to spend your time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I spent a futile hour searching for Season 3 online or on a U.S. compatible DVD, and finally decided to go with Amazon streaming content, which worked seamlessly: it took less than 5 minutes to register my Roku device and decide to purchase the HD version, and in the time it took for me to walk from my laptop up to my TV room, the episodes were available for viewing.<br /><br />As far as entertainment content, Season 3 is a letdown from Seasons 1 and 2.  The first two seasons kept us enthralled with the primary story arc of Mary & Matthew, culminating with the glorious Season 2 finale.  The acting is as brilliant as ever, but the writing seems a bit strained, e.g. unbelievable coincidences creating new conflicts, characters suddenly acting uncharastically.  But it's still far better than the reality shows or procedural crime shows that dominate network television nowdays.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A slow start. But fascinating. The backdrop of Merlin and Nimue is the most imaginative foundation I've ever encountered. Tennyson would approve.  Thank you  P J P
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book makes you think outside the box.  Love the dual perspective!  I would recommend to anyone who liked, &#34;The Help&#34; as well.
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|Two of the DVDs were damaged. Played fine until somewhere in the middle of the story, then began to become scrabbled and would not continue to play.
0316223239|5.0|This story is told from the perspective of a 5 year old, and it steals your heart!  It's a must read!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Life of PI is a great movie! Special effects are just outstanding and a great story. A must see in blue ray. Not a movie for the young ones.
B00290YDD4|3.0|I'm not a big fan of Pink Floyd except for a few  albums. But Division Bell is my favorite. After dozens of plays, I find this album still very good.<br /><br />I have a CD and a vinyl release (blue one). The CD release sounds great. For cons, the vinyl version sound disaster. There is no dynamic. I have never heard vinyl sound as bland as this one.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Hours of fun with this one  I love it!!!!<br />Fun for the young and older persons. Keeps your mind going strong
B00C2VGAW2|1.0|I bought 2 of this CD (one for a gift) and was completely unhappy that Filter's cover of \\"Happy Together\\" was not included.  It was on the trailer, I havn't seen the movie yet so I don't know about that.  This is a huge disappointment for me and a total waste of money as the rest of the CD is really not that good.  Postscript: The song \\"Happy Together\\" isn't in the movie either.  It's only on the trailor.
B004NELBPC|1.0|I read the huffpost online but hate the kindle app since I cant read the font.  Don't. really apreatiate the crap sideboob articles either.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|A dull attempt to rewrite history<br />The acting is terrific but there are far better fiction dramas on which to spend your evening
B009R659L8|4.0|I have read her entire collection.  She write in a formula, but I like the formula.  Part of my enjoyment is trying to guess the killer and I pride myself that I usually do before the midpoint of the book.  This book took me deeper than any others before I figured it out.  Ms. Clark, as usual has a sympathetic heroine and two or three romances.  She set a scene better than most authors - her descriptions of the locale, the appointments, the scenery, and the character's attire always paint a good picture.  I will continue to read the formula.

B00COHAUD4|2.0|Movie had really good potential but in my view was let down through the use of CGI of the title character. She could have been made far more frightening and seeing her face a lot less would have created more suspense. In the end it was as if I was watching an angry \\"alien\\" from outer space rather than a vengeful female apparition. Very amateurish and a big disappointment after such an impressive trailer.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun I didn't think it was good at first but it's like a more realistic temple run. So yeah this told me my review isn't long enough so yeah. Bananas rule.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love this mouse.  I do a lot of cartography and research work as a graduate student and was debating for a long time about whether or not to upgrade to a high quality mouse to use for my work computing purposes (primarily light graphic design and data processing).  Immediately after opening this mouse, I knew I had made the correct decision.  Love the multitude of programmable buttons, it makes some of the repetitive task go a little more quickly and the most tracks much better than the standard issue mice ... long story short, pay the small sum to make a big upgrade!

0380789035|5.0|Shadow is about to be released from prison when he learns his wife died in a car crash together with his best friend. When flying home, he meets an old man who goes by the name of Wednesday that offers him a job as his bodyguard. Since Shadow has no life to return to, he accepts the job. Wednesday is an old god (Odin) and even though America is filled with gods, they don't prosper because people no longer believe in them. Nowadays people believe in TV, Internet or fast food and those are the new gods. Wednesday wants to gather the old gods so they can fight the new ones in an epic battle. In order to do that, he takes Shadow in an extraordinary journey through America visiting old and new gods from all over the world that came to America inside people's hearts a very long time ago.<br /><br />I couldn't help but find a parallel between Shadow's story and Hercules' labours as they both undertake long journeys meeting mythical creatures and overcoming perils, whilst learning about themselves and the world surrounding them. It's amazing how many different gods and cultures Gaiman squeezed into this book, all the while maintaining a bit of suspense and mystery about what really is going on. There are also some witty moments that brought a smile to my face when I least expected it, which made me enjoy this book immensely. Advice: even though this book is long, don't make big pauses while reading it so you don't lose track of the many names and respective stories.

0345531957|1.0|I see that many others were as disappointed as I was with the ending of this otherwise excellent book.<br /><br />Grisham's last few pages detract significantly from what went before it (a 5-star book).  While some suspension of disbelief is expected in a plot-heavy novel, Grisham's ending fails a believability test:<br /><br />1. a key character acts in a fashion wholly outside any of her prior actions in the book [and had experiences that would have made her more likely to behave consistent with her past].<br />2. the protagonist, whose meticulous planning and resourcefulness are key attributes, shows neither in the end<br /><br />Grisham's editor should have had the sense to point these inconsistencies out - my only conclusion is that Grisham wanted to shock the reader with \\"an interesting plot twist\\" and his editor was too much of a sycophant to set him straight. Unfortunately it was neither interesting, nor in character, nor helpful to the entire gestalt of the book.<br /><br />Alas, we are left with one-star, where a five-star rating would have been appropriate but for the last 6 or so pages.<br /><br />I'd sure be happy with a \\"Partner: Version 2\\".

1565847032|1.0|I do not agree with the author's left-wing views, but that is not a reason for the one star review. Just check my reviews for Judt and Hobsbawn to find out that I don't automatically write bad reviews just because I don't like the author's political views. I wanted an easy understanding of Chomsky and picked this book because several reviewers said it was a good introduction. Furthermore, most of the book is organised as a Q&A so I thought that I should be able to get a clear understanding when the author answered specific questions.<br /><br />The book gravely disappoints for two reasons:<br />1. The questions are not hard. They are all posed by people who seem to adore the author. Here is an example: \\"The general media has wrongfully reported your support for Pol Pot in Cambodia. How does it feel?\\" I was not even aware of the authors support for Pol Pot. It doesn't seem to be an outright support but it certainly seems to warrant attention. The book says nothing about what actually Chomsky had said about Pol Pot. The question is horrific. Chomsky should have been asked exactly about his support, why he gave it, and what he thinks about it now. This is just one example. All the questions in the book are of this apologetic nature.<br />2. Since the questions are so \\"nice\\", the author does not really seem to take them seriously. To the above mentioned question he responds that he is used to media misreporting him. Then he proceeds to say that they US also killed many people in Southeast Asia and that Pol Pot might not have killed 1 million but maybe only 100,000. What an answer! What has the US killings in Southeast Asia have to do with Pol Pot's killings? That kind of argumentation is juvenile. I honestly don't think the author can be that stupid. More likely, the questions were asked in a very friendly setting and the answers were not really meant as the authoritative Chomsky-view. Still, there is a lot of deflection and criticism in the answer. It is very rare for an answer to directly  say what the author thinks. How is one for instance to interpret the statement that maybe only 100,000 people died. Totally impossible to know.<br /><br />I think a lot of responsibility for putting out the hero-worship in book format rests on the two editors. Activists with blinders will love everything in the book. All others will wonder what is going on. This book is a live example of some kind of Chomsky-cult, which I did not know even existed. Ultimately, the book is a great disservice to the author because he must be able to answer much more intelligently. I am left thinking that the author likes to surround himself with like-minded people that consider him a hero. Otherwise he could easily have pulled the plug on this book.<br /><br />Finally, if you want to read something serious written by a left-winter pick up [[ASIN:0143123041 Thinking the Twentieth Century]] or [[ASIN:0143037757 Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945]]. Even a right-winger will learn from those two great book.an answer to directly  say what the author thinks. How is one for instance to interpret the statement that maybe only 100,000 people died.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Lone Survivor is the true story of Marcus Luttrell and SEAL team 10.  It is co-authored by Patrick Robinson but is told through the eyes of Luttrell.  This book is a great read and will certainly be enjoyed by anyone interested in military novels, or quite frankly, anyone who wants to be reminded how lucky we are to live here in the United States and be protected by the greatest military force in history.  Luttrell, through the book, not only gives us the details behind the tragic loss of SEAL team 10, but also much insight into the training involved in becoming a Navy SEAL, the brotherhood that forms as a result of those trials, and the absolute resolve of those serving our country overseas.<br />The book itself - as far as a piece of literature is concerned, is a bit choppy.  The book opens with Luttrell visiting the homes of the families that lost their loved ones in operation Red Wing.  From there, it takes us to training for the Navy, then to the SEALS.  The book is half over before the read actually gets into the operation Red Wing itself.  This isn't all bad, because the training portion of the book is fascinating, but Luttrell has a habit throughout the story to flashback to other situations, other things he wants us to know, other points that weren't mentioned that have to be caught up on.  So from a readers perspective, the story is not as fluid as you'd like it to be.  Fortunately, most of us who have read the book didn't pick it up because we were looking for the next literary masterpiece.  We read the book because we wanted to hear the story of SEAL team 10.....and that's exactly what you get with Luttrell's book.<br />Very enjoyable, very heartfelt, and very humbling.<br />Recommended.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I have read a number of sniper books, they all basically follow the same format, from shooting as a kid to military training and on to perhaps one or two reports of active combat. There was only one real sniper book, &#34;One shot one kill&#34; Carlos Hathcock, all the rest are Wannabees.

We (mid twenties) enjoy Disney or other animated movies and we thought this was cute. I don't think we will be buying it to watch over and over,  but it was nice for a 24 hour rental.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Jurassic park builder is set after the movies, this time the characters are having you help them in building the park. The app uses Facebook to keep track of your progress or it can save it locally. If you decide to use Facebook then you can send daily gifts to any friends of yours that also have the app or use it online. The game itself is really fun so it'll probably be easy to get a few friends involved, but it doesn't require friends to progress. The app glitches at times and fails to save your most recent progress and at other times it will freeze, requiring a kindle restart before allowing you to continue. Even with this though it's good enough to still get a five star rating from me.  :)

B0018PH3L0|1.0|How could the film version of such an amazing book go so wrong?  Especially with such great actors?  Poor sound / picture quality are certainly to blame here, but that is only the tip of the iceberg.  Save the money and spend the extra time to read the book, instead.  It's at least 1000x better.
0345803493|5.0|Cant say too much about this book!! It was great the whole series is great!! My fav part is when christian put all those flowers in his parents boat house for anastasia, to represent the hearts and flowers, she wanted from him it was soo sweet, especially coming from a man who can and has done anything he wanted.<br /><br />I also loved the part about \\"mrs robinson\\" lol! and about leila the ex sub, shes a complete psycho!! OMG!<br /><br />i recommend this book to all 17 and older, cuz this is book is waaay too mature for anyone younger!!

I loved how christian changed for anastasia, hes a great man and sexy too, I found myself going back to read the steamier sections over and over and over again lol!! the one thing i dont like is that with all authors when theay get to the last book of a series, its like they run out of ideas or things to say! what is with that? with that being said, i didnt like the ending, i think another book is in order to explain more of christians life. I felt we were deprived of it<br /><br />Overall great book, i will definitely read the series over, they were just that great!
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this was my first experience with Black Veil Brides...I am not an existing member of the Army.  Listening to everything from Yanni to Fall Out Boy to Boyce Avenue to Disturbed, I can honestly say that I simply appreciate anything that makes me stop and pause.  The rhythms on this album have many throw-back characteristics of 80s hair bands, yet retain the sophistication that electronic meddling can inject.  Andy's voice has a quality that speaks of too many cigarettes and late nights, but in these songs - it's right.  So the Army?  Sign me up!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the book and the rest of the series, but i did not like the fact that no explanation was given for why katniss killed districts 8 leader, and furthermore that she was arrested for it. I mean, I understood what happened, but you had to infer and not every one is that good at inference, some people just like to know. The way pres snow died was also a mystery, which should have been revealed. Another thing is I didn't like that katniss ended up with peeta, she should have ended up with gale, plus the fact that peeta was hijacked and could still kill her makes matters worse.<br /><br />all in all i love the book, but couldve been better with the above alterations!!

B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey!  Every thing about it, from the cast to the plotlines to the gorgeous location is exceptional.  My only complaint is that the seasons are so short.. I just wish American TV production companies would take notice of the overwhelming success of this show and start giving us more quality content instead of the garbage they have been producing in recent years.  ENOUGH with all the &#34;reality&#34; crap and absurd competition shows.  I find I am watching more and more PBS stations and Netflix offerings than the junk they are trying ti cram down our throats.

B000LB7G00|5.0|I use this all the time for 3d modeling in Sketchup and for browsing Google Earth. It's heavy so it sticks to the desk, and the control panel has a bunch of sensitivity settings independent of each program (so you can customize it to the level of detail work you need to do). The two side buttons are super useful too for shortcuts like &#34;undo&#34; and &#34;delete&#34;.
193700788X|1.0|This book was an even bigger disappointment than Deadlocked. There was only one minor twist in the story. Every other event was plainly obvious pages before it happened. She basically brought everyone back and ended their story with a pretty bow. I have no idea what could possibly be in \\"After Dead\\" that hasn't already been covered. Overall, the entire book was a boring disappointment.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this book but it quickly became addictive.  The author did a great job of developing the characters and by the end of the book you felt you really knew Harold and his wife, Maureen.  I have already recommended the book to others.  The premise of the book is that Harold Fry is a recent retiree who receives a letter from a long ago work acquaintance.  His pilgrimage to see her adds new layers to the book and it is a fascinating read.

B001KK2NDQ|5.0|The condition of the book was as advertised by the seller.  I felt the ad was a bit misleading in the fact it purported to be a first edition 1961. It was not a first edition, but actually a 1967 14th printing, but I am still giving the purchase 5 stars in that it was in the good condition as advertised.  I have always wanted a copy of the cookbook, so I did not purchase it as a collectible, but rather for personal use and can't wait to try my first recipe from it!  The cookbook did not appear to have been used and the pages (except for a somewhat yellowed color) are in excellent condition.

1401235166|3.0|Not as awesome as some of the rest of the series - this one felt like the issues were merely serving as a transition from the last arc to the next one. But it's Fables, so the collection is an enjoyable read. By volume 17, if you're buying it, you know what you're in for. It's probably not the best place to start if you're not familiar with the series.
B001F4UHEE|5.0|Filled with a lot of images.  Different from the original script a bit. Great POV on Lester.  Wonderful use of images.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|From the simple, honour bound but cold world of Winterfell to the cruel grandeur of the Red Keep we become entwined in the lives of the Starks, Baratheons, Lannisters and Targaryeons brought to us on a grand scale by RR Martin.  Set some time aside and immerse yourself in the Seven KIngdoms.  The story's just begun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a grate app me and my brother love it which there are very few that are fun and not bad for you
B003VANOFY|4.0|This headset has very good sound quality, but it intermittently disconnects and re-connects.  When it's connected, though, I love it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|EVERNOTE is a must have ... GREAT PROGRAM ... it will keep you organized ... take it with you ... where ever you are ....
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This set was cheap and arrived prompt in professional packaging.  Very excited to view all of the special features!  Can't wait for the final 8 episodes.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|... a MUST READ about two strangers in combat ... where the one with<br />the upper hand gave the other ... another chance to go on with his life ...
B00012FXAE|4.0|The dvd set is nice for this price. There are some extended scenes for the movie that actually add some depth to the characters. Overall, a nice set.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time. Some people don't like it, but I love it. I've always loved playing them
B000EU1PKK|5.0|If you like Helloween from their beginnings this is one of the records you get and add to your collection.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|this is a pretty awesome game! i love how u can create ALMOST whatever u want 2  in each level and it magically appears in the game!!! what i did not like was that it did not let me have some of the things i wanted like the band one direction and a baby with a mom and various other things i wanted. but  otherwise its cool.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Got this for girlfriend thinking it would just be a cheapo case but turns out it was really good.. Nice and solid case she loves it and so im glad
1617751588|5.0|My family has enjoyed all of the Simon's cat books and especially looked forward to this book, adding a kitten to the mix.  Memories of Nermal and Garfield were of course the first thoughts but really Simon's cat's author really shines and rises above all other cartoon cats.  Instead of little vignettes without any overall connection, we get the tempestuous relationship from first meeting (Simon's cat pointing imperiously to his food dish when Simon arrives with a kitten in a box) to the end pages where the kitties find a comfortable relationship with each other.<br /><br />In between, there are hedgehogs, birds, play mice, chaos, machinations, tricks, and so much more as the two cats, adult and kitten, learn to appreciate and respect each other's quirks.  Along the way, whether there's a cactus masquerading as a cat toy or a crazy overly-affection rabbit, the humor and pathos of the series is a joy!<br /><br />This is one of those books that is great for all ages.  The artistry is deceptively simple yet easy to grasp - all without the need for any words.  Some of the drawings are about the relationship, some are about showcasing characters, and others are just simply fun.<br /><br />The very bet thing for me as a mother is to hear my 8 year old giggling as she and her father read the book together.  Thank you to Simon Tofield for such a treasure!
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|As usual, once i get started on these books i cant stop until i am finished.<br />This final book has wrapped everything up nicely and there was action aplenty.<br />.....but I find myself wishing for a different conclusion.......
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|It is sometimes painful to watch this drama about the horrific tsunami of 2004, but it is impossible to stop once it starts.  It is the story of a family of five vacationing in Thailand on that fateful day.  Their experience defies all probability... but there is nothing unbelievable about it.  The film has great restraint, never falling into exploitation or sensationalism. The performances are exceptional - especially the three young boys.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Had never read the books and never knew the story behind the various characters which lead me to gather the individual books and read them for self and to my granddaughter.
B008602KQI|2.0|&#34;As my title entails I didn't read the book, maybe if I had read the book I would have had the rose tinted glasses that everyone who watched this movie and gave it a five out of five had on.&#34;(the quotes are for emphasis)  Good now that we have that out of the way I will tell you what I think keep in mind this is my opinion and as such you can take or leave it. Okay I hate it..... Well I can't just say that can I. I have take my time, oh I'm sorry more of my time to make sure that no one else suffers the two hours of bad acting, terrible CGI, poor character development, and not to mention an illogical story line/setting.  This is not a spoiler so our story takes place in the future, sounds fun right wrong it like something out of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 only with a death sports theme, no references to books in relation to the death of the love of knowledge and knowledge seeking like in Fahrenheit 451 (I love that book just making analogy to the totalitarian state in that book and in this movie),  and a lack of me giving a crap about the conflict between the protagonist and the government (and as we all know they are the type of futuristic government that is corrupt, infringing on freedom of anything, and full of no good reason to be evil other than because the story line needs a poorly written mustache twirling villain(they are dying commodity aren't they, mustache twirling villains that is) inserted into that generic fill in the blank here spot trope).  CGI is brief, lazy, badly done, and looked computer animated. When the CGI looks computer animated there is a problem (except of course if your movie is TRON but in that case I'd be more worried about stagnating and having a bad story).  Moving on a broad view of the story and not it's enactments by the antagonists. Well maybe a little more, but more on positive note. Does anyone know the origins of the the word decimation, well if you do I'm telling you anyway. Decimation comes from the system of punishment for deserters of the roman army where for every ten men that deserted one would be killed as punishment and an example to the remaining soldiers that were allowed to live. Why do bring this up, well because the whole death game concept actually isn't bad just poorly written and executed.  to finish up character development I felt nothing, no emotion, after, the whole good bye scene, the rest nothing the little girl that saves the protagonist life nothing, the love scene looked forced even from the stand point that it probably was forced in the original book context. So that's about it I would go into more detail but well I guess the movies just is not worth it, I suppose it is not bad, but it's not that good either and for a 2 hour movie to be just okay uh well it really wasn't worth my time, maybe the books better I don't know.  one last book reference I would like to see a modern day female protagonist like Patricia C. Wrede's princess Cimorene, strong, charming, intelligent, and sure of herself without trying so hard to fit the strong female protagonist role in other words a natural female protagonist. For the first time and not the last hopefully this is the draconian of a critic wishing you happy movie viewings.
B000G3MKT0|1.0|When I order this album I was hoping for a fast delivery based on your other reviews.  It was not sadly, but I can handle slow shipping.  I had been tracking the package for over a week and was ecstatic seeing it was to be delivered today, that was until I opened it.  The sleeve was in poor condition but thats all part of the vinyl game.  I took out the record and IT WAS SNAPPED IN HALF! I am so disappointed that I wasted money and this piece of junk.  There was no labeling on that package stating do not bend in half! Glad I wasted nearly two weeks waiting for this album only to met with complete and udder crap!
1457514508|4.0|Note: I received this as an Advanced Review Copy.  This did not influence my review.<br /><br />While The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club certainly has elements of a mystery, I would call this more of a black comedy of human errors.<br /><br />The story is set in a small, well-to-do Savannah neighborhood, and the reader quickly discovers that beneath well-manicured lawns, stately homes and pampered dogs lie enough secrets to make the most hardened urbanite tremble with fear.  Almost all of the main characters are fortunate in some way, but that's not enough.  If they're not undone by their ambition, they're haunted by darkness from their past.<br /><br />The story opens with an assassin sizing up the site of the kill he's prepped for over the last few days.  The rest of the book leaves us to figure out not only who is going to be killed but why.  By the time the book is over, we will have encountered not one, not two and not even three but four potential victims and the people they've wronged.  Guessing the identity of the assassin is much easier than figuring out who wants whom killed and why.<br /><br />Only one thing is certain: careful whom you irk in a small town.<br /><br />Whitehead presents a varied cast of characters, from the genteel and influential women of the titular dog walking club to the besotted newlyweds to the struggling young couple with the baby to the ambitious- and newly widowed- local politician.  While some of the characters appear one-dimensional at first, we see through their actions and follow through what they're really made of.  Who is willing to pull the proverbial trigger- and over what- is frequently surprising.  Just as unpredictable is what people are willing to let go.<br /><br />The book is also frequently funny, and I found myself laughing out loud several times- particularly at the very end.  The author clearly has a twisted sense of humor, but I suspect also a certain sense of justice.<br /><br />Some of the backstory stretched plausibility.  Overall, though, I was able to overlook those problems and became absorbed in trying to figure out who wanted their neighbor gone worse than anyone else.<br /><br />It's my understanding that this is the first book in a trilogy.  I look forward to reading the rest.ched plausibility.

0393345408|5.0|Breakout Nations is ostensibly an investment guide, but it's really a snapshot of the world economy, particularly the emerging markets and those that are on the verge of \\"breaking out\\" or achieving the next level of income.  (Although the term \\"emerging market\\" is used in different ways in different places, for the purposes of this book it refers to nations in which the average annual per capita income is less than $25,000.)<br /><br />You cannot talk about this class of nations- or the global economy itself- without talking about China.  China itself is an emerging nation and has driven the growth of many of the others, particularly those that are dependent on commodity exports.  While the political posturing around China tends to veer to extremes- \\"China is eating our lunch!\\" or \\"China is about to implode!\\"- Sharma takes, appropriately, the middle path.  Much of the low-hanging fruit has been grabbed in China, and much of that is dependent on demographics: while China was able to add about 90 million workers between the ages of 35 and 54 to the workforce in the last decade, in this decade they will add closer to 5 million such workers.  The smaller workforce translates into higher wages and thus higher prices, and that will almost undoubtedly lead to a shrinking of demand for their manufactured goods.  In other words, growth rates of 8 percent or more are most likely a thing of the past.  However, Sharma is more bullish on China (at least compared to the bears) in part because while many of the easy gains have been realized, there is still a need to modernize its manufacturing infrastructure, and those are the kinds of investments the Chinese governments have been keen on.  China will most probably cool, but reducing to 6 or 7 percent annual growth is a less dire scenario than reducing to 4.<br /><br />China's economy has been driven by manufacturing and it's increasing output has been dependent on commodities from other countries.  While there were fortunes to be made from commodities, the rule seems to hold that an economy highly dependent on them is more likely to overheat and then eventually crash than one that isn't.  Russia and Brazil are good examples of a such; they are living large right now but don't have a cushion to fall back on when demand inevitably recedes.  Of all of the commodity economies Sharma profiles, only Indonesia seems to know how to work the dynamics to its favor, possibly because they were burned by the cycle in The Fifties.<br /><br />Manufacturing has been considered the smart way to grow an economy from one level to another, but it's far from a silver bullet.  While Taiwan grew significantly because of its manufacturing output, its weakness is that it never made the transition from a destination for other nation's factories to a nation that had its own industries.  Against the prevailing wisdom at the time, South Korea did make that transition, fostering corporations that built innovative products (and subsuming those that weren't competitive in the market).  And while many of the largest South Korean companies are family-owned, they tend to be professionally managed.  Of all of the countries profiled in the book, South Korea is the one Sharma seems to be betting will be the breakout.<br /><br />Perhaps surprisingly, Sharma is a little more bullish on Europe than most economists although he, like many others, argues that the inherent weakness of a shared currency like the euro is that it leaves individual nations unable to adjust when circumstances demand it.  However, while many nations in Europe are going through a downturn, Poland and the Czech Republic are quiet standouts, in large part because they have paid attention to the fundamentals of a good economy, including putting money away to make strategic public investments.<br /><br />One has to wonder how the leaders of the European Union feel about their treatment of Turkey's entrance application several years ago.  Certainly, the Turkish are probably relieved that they were denied.  The energy released when the Turks lifted their ban on open displays of religious culture corresponded with a vigorous economic revival.  While certainly based on manufacturing, it is more dependent on domestic demand than other similar economies and has gone hand in hand with domestic investment in infrastructure (and education).  However, a potential weakness is that its domestic savings is relatively low- 20 percent compared with 50 percent in China.  Another potential weakness is that Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, while a cautious economic steward, has been in power for a decade and has indicated that he would like to remain so, albeit in a different role.  It remains to be seen whether he will be more like a Putin or Wen Jiabao.  Of course, as Sharma notes, the leader who can effectively manage a country's finances can usually get away with almost anything politically.<br /><br />If investments are bets, Sharma is hedging on India.  While the large population and cultural dynamism are now seen as strengths, India's political system, rightly charged with corruption and cronyism, is what is holding it back.  While any student of Indian history is reluctant to give Churchill credit for any insights, he did have a point when he noted that \\"India\\" was as descriptive of a political or economic system as \\"Europe\\".  Certainly we are seeing that now as modern Indians seem more engaged in local than national politics.  Also, India, like many of the other countries profiled in the book, has been guilty of believing its own public relations campaign and presuming that it will be the next China.  The extent to which the Indian government can implement policies to make it so- even if it's at the expense of its traditional clients- will determine the extent to which they can make their advertising a reality.<br /><br />If there is a problem that the global economy suffers from as a whole, it is an unwillingness to tolerate the kinds of recessions that punctuated our overall trend of growth for the last 150 years.  Indeed, the emerging market miracles are a direct result of the stimulus the United States implemented to smooth out the dotcom bust of 2000 and 2001.  The low interest rates did exactly as intended and increased money available for investment.  Unforeseen, however, was the extent to which that money would flow into foreign markets, which led to the booms in these nations.  Easy money was key to growth for some, but intelligent policies are necessary if those gains are going to be maintained or built upon.  Those well-positioned to do that are the ones who will break out.<br /><br />In spite of the copious statistics, this was a compelling if not \\"easy\\" read.

B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Except the special effects there is basically nothing to watch in this movie. Complete failure. A tale playing with<br />big existential themes in children book with adult key genre - sort of Little Prince idea. Never takes off in any direction.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so different from the movie Hunger Games, from the beginning to the end. I would recommend this book to someone who likes adventurous and action books with a bit of romance.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This song is great.  Really has those old-school disco vibes, and with a modern touch.  Random Access Memories is shaping up to be quite a release, and this radio edit is just the tip of the iceberg.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|loved the game. I got really into it however the file became to big for my kindle to hold. I had to delete it.
0061537969|5.0|This book was in excellent condition, arrived on time and was a terrific read. It should be compulsory for every potential, and actual, dog-owner to read. A sweet and touching story, with a humorous backdrop that makes it a worthwhile read.
1452115567|5.0|I follow Thiswildidea on Instagram so I see Theron's photos of Maddie regularly and wanted to have something tangible to look at from time to time. The book is fantastic. I am amazed over and over again how he gets Maddie to get into some of these places!! I don't think it'll get old any time soon.
1780721676|5.0|I love this book!  I watched on PBS Dr. Mosley's documentary and was fascinated.  I now do intermittent fasting as a way of life.  I do it two days a week when I am at work. Since I work evenings, I start at 1 pm after having a big lunch.  I group my calories while I am at work so I can concentrate and not feel hungry.  Then I just have coffee the next day until 1pm.  Knowing that at 1pm I can eat a nice meal and not worry about carbs etc is a great feeling!  On the weekends I can eat what everyone else is eating.  I have lost 5 lbs and that is all I need to lose.  I love this concept because I don't need to worry about dieting EVERY DAY!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|So I actually got this just to make background noise for me at work, and I can say that there is a TON of really neat noises. They also let you create mixes and such so your not stick to just one noise. So you really can make your own environment. I personally like the cat purring paired with a fireplace because it makes me feel cozy, or play up the rains (or Brown noise because it sounds like rain to me) and thunders a bit to make me think it's storming outside. I also use the alarms that can fade in for you so you're not shocked awake.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I simply cannot understand why certain reviewers dislike Lana Del Rey.  I believe she is a 21st century Patti Smith.<br />The EP PARADISE is dark, haunting and exquisite.  Lana's music pushes boundaries and often pays homage<br />to past cultural icons much in the tradition of Patti Smith's work.  Lana's voice is rich and powerful.  Her lyrics are honest<br />and authentic.  The songs on PARADISE are more stripped down than her previous &#34;Born to Die&#34; CD and her voice<br />is front and center.  And Lana Del Rey has one of the most gorgeous and haunting voices I have heard in years.<br />I read today in The Huffington Post that her detractors make her want to drink.  Lana, just keep on doing what you are<br />doing and ignore The Haters....they are simply jealous of your many talents.  I look forward to watching you continue to<br />develop as an artist and encourage you to keep on your path and stay true to who you are as a songwriter and singer.<br />Your version of Leonard Cohen's Chelsea Hotel better be on your next CD!!
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|The movie still reminds us that we need A little romance,in are lives, parts of it also reminds us that we also have A darker side that we must do everything possible to control it.So this movie was excellent.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Fantastic!!!! I love this CD. The music is up to date and these five guys are amazing. Only thing missing are the bonus tracks!
B0038KHTGC|4.0|I've know about this band for a number of years now, but I literally just started listening to them a coup'la weeks ago w/the stellar &#34;The ScareCrow&#34; from '08, & this, the 2nd part of the trilogy that started w/'ScareCrow' is almost as equally amazing too! Tobias Sammet is just an amazing & passionate singer, w/this band/project & his own band EdGuy-I saw them open for Kamelot in '08 at B.B. Kings in N.Y.C., & it was my 1st time ever seeing EdGuy, & they just blew me away w/their live show! I even met Tobias Sammet after the show too, & got my pic taken w/him & he autographed my ticket as well. He was a really down to Earth & cool dude! He didn't come across as rude, nor arrogant-genuinely nice guy! He patiently talked to & signed LOADS of EdGuy & Avantasia CD's & merch for fans. I also met Casey Grillo that night too, & got y pic w/him & my gf, & his autograph as well.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the review: :P<br />The only song on here that I'm kind of not too sure about is &#34;States Of Matter&#34;, despite the phenomenally talented Russell Allen of NJ Prog Metallers Sym X on lead vocals on this track, the lyrics just seem to not connect w/the rest of the CD, & I just don't get it is all. Maybe after some more spins in my BR player, I will? I don't know. But, the rest of the album is just amazing! Some awesome contributions on here from the likes of the aforementioned Allen as well as Tim &#34;The Ripper &#34; Owens (ex. Priest, Iced Earth, Beyond Fear,...) on the Speed-Metall-y &#34;Scales Of Justice&#34; which just is right up Tim's alley. It was nice to hear him singing something new-er, as I LOVED his contribution to the 2 CD's he sang on for Iced Earth (too bad Jon Schaffer screwed him over BIG time!-he'd be a much better replacement for Barlow-AGAIN-then a Death Metal grunter!), as well as his singing for Priest & more recently his own band Beyond Fear.<br /><br />Jorn Lande-(ANOTHER phenomenal singer!)-& Michael Kiske also sang their lungs out on this too! I was never a fan of Helloween, I just always found them to be cheesy, but Kiske's voice is just awesome! Not tom mention The Scorps's Klaus Meine giving it his all on &#34;Dying For An Angel&#34; in a passionate ballad duet w/Sammet.<br /><br />I wish that they had noted which sections were sung by which guest vocalists though, as some who appeared on this album, well, I'm not familiar w/their work, nor their voices, I'd just like to know who's who, as many guest singers collaborated on the same song(s) & Jorn Lande on the title track sounds quite a bit like Russell Allen-well, to me anyway-& I've been listening to Sym X since '03. I've only heard the CD once since I got the other day, so I can't do a song-by-song breakdown w/a more explicit review of this album, but suffice it to say that if you love melodic Symphonic Power Metal w/soaring, passionate vocals, great melodies & harmonies, as well as some killer guitars & drums coming from such talents as Eric Singer & Bruce Kulick of KI$$, Sasha Paeth (long-time Kamelot producer), & a guy named Miro who did orchestration on here & who's done work on just about EVERY Kamelot CD, then you will LOVE this band!<br /><br />There are other contributors but names I am not familiar w/. & for background vocals there is Amanda Somerville, & Cinzia Rizzo, plus Robert Hunnecke who have also done some greta background vocals & vocalizations on several Kamelot CD's as well.<br /><br />Tobias Sammet just seems to keep getting bigger & bigger w/this band/project, & it seems as though Avantasia is even surpassing his original/current band EdGuy in terms of fame & recognition. But, luckily he is still involved w/them, as they are a kick-ass metal band in their own right.<br /><br />I have since bought part III of this trilogy &#34;Angel Of Babylon&#34;, which I have yet to hear, but saw the vid online for &#34;SleepWalking&#34; w/the gorgeous voiced Cloudy Yang doing a duet w/Sammet, & it's just a gorgeous power ballad! I can't WAIT to hear the rest of that CD too! I REALLY hope that one day Tobias Sammet brings his 'Metal Opera' to the USA for a FULL Headline tour, as that would be just AWESOME! Especially if he can manage to gather most, if not all of the vocal talent that contributed to CD, on the songs they'd play live to tour the USA w/them. I gotta get the rest of their catalog now, & next up is their Live DVD/CD set, as I watched the live vid for &#34;ScareCrow&#34; from that Live DVD, &n it was just  killer! Even better than the studio version. & the &#34;Twisted mind&#34; from it as well-it's just too bad that they couldn't get Khan to do his parts on that song live too. But, it's KILLER nonetheless!<br /><br />So, just get it if you are into this style like I said above, you will not be disappointed!  \m/  \m/an't WAIT to hear the rest of that CD too!

0486274268|4.0|Has lots of good information.  Does not go into step-by-step drawing very much, but gives good tips and insight in how to draw different groups of animals.  For the price, it can't be beat.  Would recommend this book.
B00B47NO2O|2.0|I really tried to like this show as it sounded as if it had so much promise. Increasingly disappointed show after show until I skipped from episode 7 to the end. Apparently I only missed more of the same. The final chapter was written and all too predictive as they stated themselves. Waste of time and money if you are buying.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|I love this movie. The music takes me back in time. I watched this movie with my children years ago when it was first released. Yesterday, I had a chance to watch it with my grandchildren. We had a wonderful time watching and singing and dancing to the lyrics. Although I must admit, my younger grandson covered his eyes when the plant tried to swallow Ellen Greene. The movie was most likely a little too intense for him, he’s 4.
B001TH16DI|5.0|What more can you ask for?  Pristine Blu-ray transfers, amazing sound, and all of those things we asked for from this series of films.  These films are the blueprints of all good sci-fi and a hell of a lot of fun.  Pop the popcorn, and smile at the memories.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|But not the movie.  This was my first NS book, planning to read more but not sure I will watch the movies.
B009A882D0|5.0|This collection is very cool and clearly compiled with great reverence. There are all the songs we know and love, live versions and stuff you may not have hard before. The accompanying literature is well written and very insightful, establishing why CCR is an American mainstay.

B004T4KQJS|5.0|Eloquent and masterful. a layman`s guide to the universe from its earliest history. Cosmology has made<br />great advances in the last few decades and we are now beginning to see as described in this book how<br />the smallest particles and forces some of which are very hard to detect may hold the key to resolving the biggest picture of all our expanding universe.  This is theory without all the mathematics and so well presented that it is engaging and stimulating to read. Recommended.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Wow!  This book gives an excellent glimpse into the forster care system and the horrors that some of these chldren have suffered until they come of age and go out into the world on their own.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|So, i originally rated this as poor because it broke fairly quickly (see below for full, old review). However, the company quickly provided me a replacement without me requesting it and offered help on fixing the problems with the game. Only time will tell if this new one holds up! So far so good though.<br /><br />It's great to see such a great company still in existence. They have amazing customer support. That's for sure. They didn't even ask me to change the review and got my replacement to me very promptly. So, if yours breaks down, even if its after the amazon return limit time period, i would suggest calling the company as my dealings with them have been wonderful.<br /><br />-----------Old Review:<br />I needed a gaming mouse with multiple buttons for WoW.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Inexpensive<br />You can make it purple!<br />Good size for my hands (tall lady here. It's not too big, not too small ;) )<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can only change glow of the back piece logo.<br />Wow doesnt recognize all the different buttons.<br />Breaks within a month and a half -- just outside the amazon return date :/ . (Mine kept phantomly clicking, double clicking, and holding randomly...it got worse with time)

B00CL151G4|5.0|When I watched the pilot back in September 2012, I was uncertain how yet another Holmes re-telling would stack up. I was pleasantly surprised! Brilliant writing and acting on all counts! Jonny Lee Miller's portrayal of Holmes is smart, witty, and fun. Lucy Liu's Watson is every bit as brilliant. Elementary stays true to the legendary partnership that Holmes and Watson have while bringing a truly refreshing perspective to the table. The setting of New York, Holmes as a struggling drug addict, and Watson as former surgeon turned sober companion casts the Sherlock Holmes stories into a new, unique light. It is a joy watching Holmes and Watson's friendship develop while they struggle to overcome their own personal challenges and demons. It is equally entertaining seeing them at work solving the NYPD's toughest cases and watching their partnership develop. Whether you are a Sherlock Holmes fan or a curious viewer, Elementary will not disappoint. I did not hesitate to order the first season.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I'm working my way thru the series in order so this was my third Jack Reacher book, counting the movie.  I read primarily to escape and I like the character Jack Reacher.  He's a man who acts like a man and he has the luxury of being a fictional character so he can do what needs to be done.<br /><br />I also like how the author explains the technical stuff in plain English so I can understand what Jack understands.  Child doesn't try to impress me with big words that I have to look up (tho looking up words on my Kindle is really easy!) to follow along.  He also fills in Reacher's background in each book, so you don't have to start at book #1 if you don't want to.<br /><br />This story, specifically, was good with a handful of twists and turns and a climax that wouldn't let me put it down.<br /><br />Overall a fun read and better way to relax after work than watching TV.  Pick up a copy and give it a shot.  If you like good guys who know what a situation needs and are not afraid to do it, you'll like Jack.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Once again, George R.R. Martin has continued his tale and further develops each if his characters. His level of detail, as in all of his books, makes A Dance with Dragons an incredibly enthralling and exciting read. You won't be able to put it down!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I have not totally finished season 3 but i am savoring this series as I so enjoy it.

0375869026|5.0|I had read a review on here, that the author should have told the entire story from the main character - August Pullman's perspective. But for me, it worked just the way it is. I wouldn't change a single thing in this well written, heartwarming story. And for my 9 year old daughter, seeing August through the eyes of several different characters was helpful.<br /><br />Like with so many great books, we laughed and cried and didn't want the book to end.<br />In a few years, when my youngest child is 8 or 9, I will be reading it with him as well. I think every child should read it. It will help teach the \\"regular\\" looking kids what the children with anomalies and their families already know - that they are normal kids and are just hoping to be accepted for what's inside them, not judged by their appearances.<br />Auggie Pullman has a special place in our hearts.<br />This was a library book, but we'll be buying it in hardcover this weekend. It's one of those!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I've read many of the Reacher books and Tom Cruise did a reasonable job. For some reason the movie was not memorable.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|I feel in love with the first book so I hoped that the second would stack up to it. I read it in 2 days because I just couldn't put it down! Started the 3rd and can wait to keep going with the series!

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Do not be fooled!  This book is as important for adults as it is for children!  My nine year old loves it.  The short chapters make progress fun!  It is packed with perspective and appreciation for feelings -- good and bad.  BUY IT!  SHARE IT!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy!!!!  I was skeptical in the beginning afraid of reading &#34;porn&#34;  There is STRONG sexual content however the story is very intrguing!  It was so hard for me to put the books down!  So many twists!  What you think is going to happen may not actually take place.  I fell in love with the charaters!  When I started reading book three, I was actually almost sad the trilogy was ending.  I began to read the book slower. The author leaves nothing to the imagination.  The author is very detailed!  I hoping for a movie to come out soon!  and in order to keep all the excitement/events in the book, it must be a two/three part movie!  The Fifty Shades Triology was nothing like I expected!  again, strong sexual content and language, but worth the read!  I would NOT recommend this book for someone under the age of 18...maybe even 21.  After reading the trilogy, the hardest part is finding another great read to match up the the Fifty Shades standards....  I totally recommend!!!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I am so thankful to my introvert friend who recommended this book to me.  I guess it takes one to know one!  I wish I could have read this book 30 years ago and think it should be required reading for all teachers and parents.

B007V65R54|5.0|Really good insight on many relevant topics. The way he covers each point provides the reader with really good examples of how mathematics and engineering concepts are applied in real life problems, that might have nothing to do with what those concepts where initially conceived for.<br /><br />Great book, great read, great knowledge
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This movie had less action in it than I anticipated. I think I went into this movie expecting a 'Mission: Impossible' level of action with a little more 'America' in it, but what I got was a crime thriller that had some fight sequences in it. I was very pleased by this movie and enjoyed all aspects of it: the acting, the story, the cinematography and of course the action.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|The Avengers is a great movie. As a superhero movie, you have to take it at face value and accept the fact that you aren't going to receive a solid plot line void of errors, or a movie that isn't over the top at times. This movie isn't perfect, but it is extremely fun. This movie has great action and fighting sequences, good acting, believable characters and keeps your attention the whole time.

1476733953|4.0|I don't understand why some people are giving this book such a low score. I'm not saying it deserves five stars either, but I feel that it deserves more credit than what some people are giving it. It is a very interesting book and it was very well written. The problem, I feel is that there are so many post-apocalyptic books nowadays that finding one that stands out from the rest is very difficult. But the author created a very vivid world, with realistic scenarios that made the  characters actions more believable.<br /><br />The reason I give it four stars is because it feels that the book is longer than what it needed to be. Part II could've been summarized in two or three pages, instead, we were given a very long and dull description of the relationship between the mayor and the deputy as they advance through the silo.<br /><br />Other than that, I really enjoyed reading this book and felt that out of all the post-apocalyptic books I've read, this one takes the cake. But then again, I'm a big Fallout 3 fan, so anything that displays underground vaults, uninhabitable wastelands and the constant feeling that what's out there in the unknown might not be as bad as what they led us to believe, will most likely capture my interest.<br /><br />Emmanuel
0143121006|4.0|This book explains in detail a real life murder of a young wild girl, living the high life in Peking, just before the arrival of the Japanese occupation. A gruesome murder reminiscent of Jack the Ripper. The author walks you through the investigation, and arrives at a plausible solution, to this unresolved mystery. Great fun for lovers of true life crime stories.

B000000H64|5.0|This might be the best industrial metal CD ever. It is up there with Ministry's 'Land of Rape and Honey' and 'Psalm 69'. It is more metal than those, I think.<br /><br />FF did a masterful job in writing catchy riffs, injecting their energy, using the industrial influences, and incorporating the clean vocals. It is the pinnacle of their creativity and they haven't come close to touching this level since which is too bad -- but we still have this release to console us!<br /><br />Not as much death metal influences on this one, but that just opened them up to more fans and the brutality and aggression was still ever-present.

Why do we have to pay for all of these other formats (and for those who don't believe me, yes, we are paying for these; do you really believe the studios are providing us this for free)?  I would have bought it today, if I could just get the Blu-Ray version without all of this extra %$&#^@* that the studios are charging.  Used to be that you could get a VHS without having to pay for the LaserDisc; why are DVDs and Blu-Ray discs any different?!?

B009NY43NY|5.0|I started with the Southern Vampire Mysteries when the first book came out, bought and read all of them as they appeared, and have been consistently entertained by these periodic visits with Sookie & Co. Even the books that didn't have a whole lot of major action were like a visit with an old friend where you catch up with all the day to day stuff and just relax and have fun. I'm sad that these visits are now at an end, and hope that after she's had a good rest from the Sookie universe, Charlaine Harris will write some short stories from time to time to let us know how Sookie and her friends are doing.<br /><br />The ending of Dead Ever After was in no way a disappointment because Sookie's choices accurately reflect her character and the kind of life she truly desires. I don't feel that the author owed us an HEA ending, and never thought that Sookie's relationship with Bill or Eric would be an everlasting one because it was clear that Sookie never wanted to become a vampire, and certainly would have been miserable if she had to deal with an eternity of vampire politics. It was also pretty obvious that Eric's choices were self-centered, and that's the main reason he's survived and thrived as a vampire for so many centuries.<br /><br />I enjoyed meeting the wide range of colorful characters who populate the series, and am glad that there's going to be a book that ties up loose ends for some of them. I'm going to miss my annual visit to Bon Temps, and would like to thank the author for keeping the series going for as long as she did. I'll be looking forward to her new books.

B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is a book that any dog-lover should be able to read and love! It is a fairly quick read with some unanswered questions that frustrated me a bit, but it was filled with emotion and had a fun ending. I got so wrapped up in the story and its characters that my main disappointment upon finishing was the reminder that it is fiction! I wanted to be able to read more about Denny and his family. This book made me hug my dogs a little tighter each time I put it away for the night, and each story Enzo told, I constantly found myself thinking... I wonder if MY dogs think that!?

B002PQ7JQK|3.0|I have been waiting for this product and this is my first and last purchase for the legindary series.  I do like the new effects but I have noticed some issues with this product, first and foremost was the sound levels.  Not in all episodes, but in a few I have noticed the sound levels seem to change from time to time.  I still wish there was a Disc feature PLAY ALL like I have seen on other series.<br /><br />The whole Star Date vs Air Date viewing seems to be a little dramatic to me, becasue you will have to switch DVD's to watch by STAR DATE, so I wont be going there anytime soon.<br /><br />The packaging is good, but Im a little concerned that Season 3 could not have been in the same size case as seasons 1 and 2.  It seems a little odd on the shelf if you ask me.<br /><br />I am a fan of the remastered effects, I think that is how it would have been done given the budget.  I also like the price of the set and although I have given a few points I wish they could have improved, none of that really matters if your a fan.  I rate this a 3 out of 5 Stars.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was well written and I also truly believe it occurred as it is stated in the book.<br />The proof that there is an after life was substantiated by this doctor's experience.<br />This book should be read by others that have doubts in their mind about an after life.<br />My own father-in-law stated to me that, the weekend before he passed on, that he saw in a dream<br />his former deceased family members. They had arrived on a train and told him to get on board and come with them.<br />He stated he was scared but I assured him that there was nothing to be scared of that they were your family members<br />asking him to join them at that time and get on the train.<br />A few days later he passed on.<br />The next weekend after the funeral the immediate family members came to his home to have a dinner party in his honor.<br />While I was sitting at the table suddenly my chair was jarred. I looked around to see who had walked<br />by my chair and bumped it. But everyone was sitting down talking and eating.<br />Suddenly an overwhelming feeling came over me that the train had just left the station with my father-in-law on board<br />with his family members that he saw in his dream. I become a true believer in the after life at that time myself<br />from that time on.

B009NY43NY|4.0|I discovered this series 3 years ago and devoured the first ten books.  I loved the world that CH created. I'm so glad I read the books before watching True Blood.  I was surprised by all the negative reviews of DEA.  I thought the writing was no better nor worse than the other books.  I thought the ending was fitting and satisfying.  Here's why.<br /><br />********THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS*************<br />At the beginning of the series,  Sookie was considered strange and was feared because of her telepathy.  At the end, the whole community came together to support her.  Not only had Sookie matured but so had Bon Temps.<br />Sookie never wanted to be a vampire, she loved her human life too much and loved the sun.  In fact, sunbathing was her favorite day-off activity.  It didn't seem that there was any long-term future with Eric. (and yes, I loved the Eric and Sookie romance).<br />She felt a maternal tug, every time a friend was pregnant or when she saw baby clothes.  She could never be a mother with Eric.<br />Sam was her best friend and boss.  It was very realistic to me that she didn't want to risk \\"ruining\\" the relationship she had by entering in to a romantic relationship with Sam. Love is sometimes best when it grows slowly.  The death experience changed both of them and woke them up to what was important.<br /><br />I thought the Eric-Sookie relationship began to deteriorate in book 11.  And I thought Eric, in book 12, seemed out of character.  Both these books pointed to the end of the relationship between them.<br /><br />I am so going to miss this series.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Bill Murray was robbed of the Oscar on this film--as much as I don't like competition in the arts, the deserved that award. This is very simply one of the finest and most touching motion pictures I've ever seen. It deserves all of the accolades that it received when it came out. Bill Murray offers a touching and very deep performance in the roll of a successful actor facing the challenge of being bored by his own success and his own life and being tempted by the charm of a lovely young woman (brilliantly played by Scarlet Johansson). This is a touching, soulful movie that is best watched alone. I love this movie (can you tell?).

0765325950|5.0|I was shedding some unashamed manly tears throughout. This book perfectly caps off the series, I thought. All of the little side stories that Jordan had built onto the main story are neatly tied up, and all of the notable characters are here. It's a very long book, and most of it is beautifully written. &#34;Intense&#34; would be an understatement. It's the last battle from the onset, and is being fought on multiple fronts. No one, including main characters, are safe in this, so be ready to scream at a book like it is able to give a response. Seriously, I was so frustrated with points, but they all felt necessary. Everything from the Black Tower to Cha'Faile are in this fight and its a grueling one. If you've been a fan of the series, this is a must-have. Just be prepared to send an angry letter to Brandon Sanderson demanding that he find some way to write in this realm again, because he did it a great justice with this entry.
1401207529|4.0|Is batman: year one extremely important and help establish ideas that continue to influence batman today? Yes. Does it fill in some gaps and expand on the origin? Yes. Are there any amazing moments that really jump out at you as brilliant? I didn't think so. In one word, I find it overrated. In fact I find all of frank miller's work on batman to be overrated. It's definitely worth you're money and essential to a batman fan, but it's really nothing special (in the narrative sense).
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a bittersweet book that made me laugh and experience sorrow for the characters. In a few places I was bothered by the change of point of view but that's just a personal peeve. The story was wonderful in that it showed the need for relationship in everyone's life.
1401232590|3.0|Batman: The Long Halloween is definitely worth your money and contains a deep story that has influenced every facet of batman, most recently the dark knight trilogy. For example, the scene in The Dark Knight were Joker burns the cash is inspired by a scene in this book. \\"I believe in harvey dent\\" was created in this book. The art is excellent. Its really different and in some ways funny because there are entire scenes stolen from the godfather. It explores some philosophical issues, which is always a plus for me, and deals a lot with crime and punishment and how it often seems to fail. That being said, no part of the story really pops or excites, and sometimes it seems villains show up for no reason at all and it feels a little muddled and unclear as to what the ultimate goal of this book was outside establishing two face's origin. Important but highly overrated.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The fact that a neurosurgeon with the impressive credentials of Eben Alexander lll had this experience is indicative of the old adage that coincidence is \\"when God chooses to remain anonymous\\".  The undeniable, unexplainable experience of having his spirit or conscientiousness continue on after his brain and body were considered inoperable and incapable of conjuring up this experience in his imagination is something that borders on proof that our spirit is in fact separate from our physical body.  As a devoted Christian I was disappointed by the absence of any reference to Jesus during Eben's visit to heaven and I was somewhat turned off by some of his \\"new age\\" verbiage like his occasional references to God as \\"Om\\", but I think anything that offers what could considered \\"proof\\" that there is something out there beyond this physical life is a good thing, especially for those who choose to deny such things.
1401216676|5.0|Wow. This is one of the few batman books considered legendary that I completely agree with. Perhaps its biggest strength is its flexibility. Joker's origin is intentionally not definitive so as to let joker's story really be immersive and your own. In the dark knight, when speaking on where he comes from, joker says \\"I prefer to leave it multiple choice,\\" that's a reference to this book. The ending is also uncertain, so you get to make your own ending. Joker is dark, murderous and still silly and ridiculous, which, to me anyway, is the only way joker should be. The art is great. Basically, everything that happens in this book, has been adapted to the main cannon(pre new 52) because its so...amazing. This really works hard to show the joker as batman's mortal enemy and ultimate destiny, and it couldn't work better.

0345803493|2.0|I ordered a New version of this book and it came used. It was wrapped in partially closed plastic wrap and the cover is dirty. Many of the page are bent and &#34;dog-eared&#34; which is what I was trying to avoid, hence I bought a New book. Not pleased at all.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm among the legion of Downton Abbey addicts.  The various stories are interesting and I continue to care about the characters.  The sets and costumes do a great job of recreating the era.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Kind of a let down. Not  much of a story line, just everyone wants Sookie dead. All this build up between her and Eric and the relationship just ends, like no big deal.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I loved this book almost all the way through, until the last few chapters.  Seemed to go really fast, and end abruptly.  I'm anxious to see the movie version now. I love Jennifer Lawrence, but after reading the book, wish they could have taken advantage of all the great late 30's, 40-ish actresses, since she is described as a \\"few years older\\" than Pat, who is 35.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Marvel and this film didn't disappoint at all. To me this is a lovely superhero movie.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|My daughter and I loved &#34;taking care of our horse&#34;, but after about a month or so, the app was freezing, and having all sorts of problems.  I finally uninstalled it, and it was disappointing, because we had a nice build up of coins, and had no desire to start all over.
1439102732|5.0|Jodi Picoult is one of the best authors around, and this is among her better books.  I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to try out her books.  If you're already a fan, then you already know.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love the predictions when you type. Sometimes you can write a whole sentence just by click on the word above the keyboard. Swiftkey predicts what it thinks the next work will be. For example, if you type &#34;I&#34; it will put up three words that normally after &#34;I&#34;, such as &#34;have&#34;, &#34;am&#34;, and &#34;think&#34;.
