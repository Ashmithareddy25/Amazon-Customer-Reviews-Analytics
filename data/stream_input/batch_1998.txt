1400069289|5.0|Ships so fast I cannot believe it.  I love ordering this way.  No time in stores just pick up at my doorstep.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have no words to explain how this book has touched me. The books is truly wonderful.<br /><br />Thank you for a heartfelt read!!
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|I love the movie. But I dont believe that the item arrived as described. They described is as &#34;very good&#34;. Its pretty scratched up. That to me is &#34;used&#34; or &#34;acceptable&#34;. I sent back prior feedback but I didnt get any kind of response. It does play
B009IEXKXI|5.0|From the beginning I was impressed with the authors obvious knowledge of the workings within the space/government complex.  I worked for 21+ years in the intelligence arena and I can tell that the author has either first-hand knowledge or has done some very good research. I like the humor and the inside jokes between mission control and The Martian!  There are some typos and misplaced wording, but considering the price, it's a great read.  I've been reading SF for over fifty years and I have missed true Science Fiction; THIS IS SCIENCE FICTION!!
B000NY12CI|3.0|The story of Ayaan's life is hard to read.  Especially her growing up years.  I was impressed with her progress in Holland and with the fact of her election to Parliament.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|this game would be better if the building's and units that i have built would be saved from one day to the next
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great book for a cold Winter. Love Colleen Hoover - always! Would recommend to anyone and everytone. Great read. Love!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game I mean games not only do you have to earn them but it keeps you trying to get more points I highly recommend it to everyone who needs to pass time it works well on my kindle fire hd and it doesn't run slow either perfect FREE app
B000BTJDGC|4.0|This is movie makes you think how satan really exist and how he can over come your mind and body. Scary,Scary,Scary.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I recommend reading this book it is very good<br />My mom even reads it my brother said he was going to read it
B008JEJPSC|4.0|This is the actual cinescope format, unlike the more recent pan/scan 4:3 DVD release. It seems to have been transferred from the film. The quality is much better than the DVD transfer - all of that nice film grain is present with little to no discernable digital garbage.
B005K2YRVG|1.0|Kindle 3G would not fit in it no matter how hard I tried! Trying caused the screen to go totally blank and it wouldn't work initially. Finally I was able to reset it.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I am avid fantasy reader, quite picky though. I didn't know this author before, so I was apprehensive, but when you got to read you got to read.<br />It is a very nice young adult fantasy fiction, with unexpected turns of the story, likable characters, and easy to read. Without giving too much away I can say it has quite different take on vampires (that's my favorite part).<br />And i really want to know what's next.
B0060D0Z0G|5.0|I love great stories and this is one of the best. It fills you up and never brings you down and it's true!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game soo much! Although in survival mode it startled me when the zombies attacked. I would very well reccomend this to anyone
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I am 60 years old and have read all the Potter books and seen the movies. This is a great one. I loved it.
0345803485|3.0|I have mixed opinions on E.L James' `fifty shades of grey' novel which has been met with such high acclaim, being the book that `everyone is talking about'. This love-hate relationship that I have with this piece of literature is tearing me apart, for typically one is usually able to tell whether they like a book or not. The character-study was superb with Anastasia Steel and Christian Grey being attractive, interesting characters who were the perfect `Bella and Edward' couple. The intense drama and electric tension between them radiates off the page, as you loose yourself within a captivating tale of mutual attraction and lust. The dark, sinister secrets that Christian Grey keeps hidden adds to the depth of fascination that one gets with reading this book, as you are constantly seeking out what lies beneath the surface...Unlike books that I love (such as the Twilight saga by Stephanie Meyer for example), is the mature sexual content within this novel that is a little too explicit, graphic and disturbing for rational reading. I found parts very disconcerting, as it distracted from the main characters relationship, which could have been projected to the reader with more sincerity, deepness and authenticity if it had of been `toned down a little bit'.<br /><br />This is however an exceptional adult novel, as I was truly addicted to these characters making this book a guilty pleasure and tantalizingly tempting treat! The passionately physical affair does get a little `over the top' and I certainly feel that if the author had focused more on the content and quality of prose rather than just sex, this would have created something of a much higher standard. Highly readable, interesting and enchanting you will be drawn into this heated, intense love affair that is shrouded in secrets, mystery and intrigue. E L James' concept as a whole is inspired, very well-written and cleverly crafted but sadly the fantastic storyline and detailed narrative gets lost within their sexual activities...which ultimately seems to be Never-ending!<br /><br />When literature student Anastasia Steele interviews successful entrepreneur Christian Grey, she finds him very attractive and deeply intimidating. Convinced that their meeting went badly, she tries to put him out of her mind - until he turns up at the store where she works part-time, and invites her out. Unworldly and innocent, Ana is shocked to find she wants this man. And, when he warns her to keep her distance, it only makes her want him more. But Grey is tormented by inner demons, and consumed by the need to control. As they embark on a passionate love affair, Ana discovers more about her own desires, as well as the dark secrets Grey keeps hidden away from public view...<br /><br />It is Christian Grey's singular erotic tastes that at first capture your attention to then nauseate, hence those who enjoy dark erotic fiction will love this; but perhaps not myself. *Note:  This book is intended for mature audiences*activities...which ultimately seems to be Never-ending!<br /><br />When literature student Anastasia Steele interviews successful entrepreneur Christian Grey, she finds him very attractive and deeply intimidating.

B004WMKSH2|5.0|I am 60 years old and have read all the Potter books and seen the movies. This is a great one. I loved it.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|its great when I need to relieve some stress or just need a really basic work out at the end of the day.
B001NHNG64|4.0|It was a great read. Some slow parts. I think some parts he goes into too much detail. It's almost like filler parts. But I love his books and this one is very suspenseful.
B001KQBFAM|5.0|He is amazing!!! Serpico is an amazing cop....not appropriate for younger people...old school nudity.... but besides that...great movie....great to know more about the amazing Serpico....My husband had to write a paper for school so we bought it and it was really well done....anything with Pacino in it is going to be brilliant anyway :0)
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Wish the book hadn't been so vague  but glad she shared her experience.  Overall it was an ok book. Not too impressed with the style.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I'm very glad a had the wondrous experience of reading this book on the kindle app on my iphone. So many french terms that I was not familiar with were instantly expanded on and clarified with a tap bringing up kindle's imbedded dictionary/wikipedia links. While a walk through the printed page would have sufficed... I would not have had as good time reading or have gathered as good an understanding of the world that Hugo created. Had I read a printed copy, I would have needed to stop reading to look things up in a dictionary, or use search engines. (I would have also had to hold and tote around a hefty book.) While reading a 900 page novel on a cell phone screen may seem like madness to some... the brilliant writing sweeps you along effortlessly.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|It was a quick read that kept my attention and kept me guessing.  I would recommend it if you like crime/action books.
B0059XTU1S|2.0|The Lord of the Rings was three books.  So, they made three movies.  Ok.  The Hobbit was one book, so they made three movies?  Not ok.<br /><br />The movie I saw was good enough.  It was an enjoyable enough of a thing to see.  But, as a Hobbit fan (since the 5th grade), it was very frustrating to see all of the extra unnecessary stuff they put into the movie.  It reminded me a little of when I went to Universal studios and rode on a few of their rides.  I had to wait a long time to get onto the ride.  The ride itself lasted just a few minutes.  Then, when the ride was done, they dumped you right at the entrance of a gift shop that sold products about the ride that you were just on...all over priced and all marketed to you as intensely as anything in the history of man has ever been marketed.<br /><br />That's when you realize one thing...the entire experience you've just had, had very little to do with entertaining you.  90% of the experience you've just had was about getting you to spend more money (on top of the money you have already spent).<br /><br />When you realize that... When you realize that the bulk of the experience you've just had was more about getting you to take more money out of your pocket and less about entertaining you...several things happen.<br /><br />A) You feel like a target.  You don't feel safe.<br />B) You feel like protecting yourself from the people who are providing you the entertainment.<br />C) Whatever entertainment you did experience becomes less.<br /><br />It kind of reminds me of Saturday morning cartoons.  When I was a kid, we'd sit there and watch the Looney Tunes and laugh our heads off.  Then, through a completely different source of information, you'd read about a comic book featuring the Looney Tunes.  Some, would buy the book.  Others didn't.  The people who sold the cartoons made money from advertisers...and that was ok.  Sitting through some commercials was fine.  It was the price you had to pay in order to get the entertainment.<br /><br />Today though, the Saturday morning cartoons are nothing but advertising.  Everything about them is advertising.  And all of the gadgets, dolls and etc. are marketed, not only within the commercials, but also within the show itself (product placement)...etc.<br /><br />That's when you realize it.  The people who make these shows aren't doing something that everyone else who has a job has to do...  They aren't providing a service.<br /><br />Cooks cook.  Teachers teach.  Bus drivers drive buses.  Plumbers plum.  (Sorry, bad joke.)<br /><br />But what are these people doing?  After you give them money, what service are they providing to you?  If 90% of their effort is to get you to give them more money, then what you are getting for your money is another request for money.  That's the service they provide.  That's the service you are paying for.  You give money.  They ask for more.<br /><br />It's very frustrating and makes me not feel safe.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I am a Lee Child fan and this book was no different.  Love the Reacher character and this book did not deviate from that character.  I will continue to read Lee!!
B009AMANBA|1.0|Imagine an episode of Star Trek (The Next Generation) that consists entirely of nothing but the Captain, Worf and Data sitting around a table in one of the conference rooms talking.  No action.  No plot.  Just talk.  That's what Lincoln was like.  Nothing but several hours of slightly archaic language about Lincoln's efforts to get together all of the votes that were needed to pass the 13th Amendment.<br /><br />Pure boredom...beginning to end.  My personal opinion is that it shouldn't have even been called Lincoln.  \\"The 13th Amendment\\" would have been a better title.  In a movie about Lincoln, I would have preferred to hear about his history.  Where was he born?  What were his parents like?  What was it like to be born in a log cabin?  Was he ever in the military?  What was he like as a lawyer?  What was his wife like when they were courting?  When and how did she go crazy?...etc.  What were the Lincoln/Douglas debates like?  This movie says pretty much nothing about Lincoln personally.  They don't even show the assassination.<br /><br />No thank you.  This movie was a waste of great actors.  Mr. Lewis, Mr. Strathairn, Mr. Jones, Ms. Fields...etc. have made wonderful movies over the years.  This one was garbage though.<br /><br />P.S. The one star is not an exaggeration.  I literally had to force myself to stay in the theater seat.  Staying in the theater seat was work.  The movie was sold so hard to everyone, had so many great actors in it and was about such an important topic that I decided to give it every break I could.  And, in the end, I can't justify the time or money I invested in it whatsoever.  I wish I had that time and money back.  But, I will never see it again.  Mr. Spielberg needs to realize how much time and money he has cost the world with this one.  Billions of dollars?  Billions of hours?  When you waste that much time and money of others...  How can you do something like that to people?  It's not a crime...and I don't think it should be...but,if I were a lawyer and it was my responsibility to protect a director who had made a very bad movie and had cost the world billions of dollars, I would have a very hard time finding arguments to support my client.
1442359315|5.0|This cd book was given as gift to my Aunt who's daughter read Dr Alexander's book an was very impressed. My Aunt very much liked the CD unabridged autio of this book. I was so impressed with his interaction with Oprah on her show Own.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is an amazing feat.  It literally pulls you into the lives of Sky and Holder to the point where you can't  stop thinking about what will happen next.  Mark my thoughts here, this book is probably on a list to become a blockbuster movie!  Thank you Colleen Hoover for being a brilliant author!  Definitely reading your other books.
B000I55YU8|5.0|Great action film , with phenominal scenery and Michael Douglas at his best.Good cultural subplot, explored Japanese culture.<br />Get this film !!!!!!
B00B19G01C|5.0|This was a good movie. It is about time that a jewish horror flick comes out. Starts slow but finishes strong.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I saw this great deal that Sony had on their Dual Shock controllers. So I checked out Amazon to see if they had the same deal going on, and they did. I ordered it right away, and received the item within a few days. Great transaction and super-brand-new condition. Thanks guys!
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend, I have been amazed at the level that we can go in our subconscious mind I have used this method and been spiritually uplifted and things are happening in my life for the good due to the power of my subconscious mind
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book. Like a short fifty shades of grey. But without all the ''porn'' as some people put it. Was great watching the story unfold! My only wish would be to see another book in series or possibly just an afterthought included with the book giving a further look at how their lives unfold later on. Otherwise loved it!!
B002BBJ52U|2.0|Very slow moving, had its high points, but overall a movie I'd not recommend to anyone over 18 years old.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|While book one was interesting the series ran out of steam and by the third and final (thank goodness) book it was predictable and difficult for me to finish.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I think I expected too much from this author.  After a thrilling Harry Potter series, I expected this to be a top notch read.<br />Seriously disappointed, adult books don't need to filled with porn.  I quit midway in.
1451696191|4.0|I got this for my son as a present at his request. Don't know much about it myself, but he likes it. I think it is good for teen agers.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I hadn't read this since high school. Purchased it after watching a special on the Depression and was not disappointed!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so fun addictive. You just keep going till you die. Would recommend it for adults and kids alike
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I loved the fact that the book was told, 100 percent, from the perspective of a mentally unstable protagonist. However, I couldn't stomach one more reference to the Eagles' cheer.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|you should real get this it helps you and other users know how much battery you have...I hope you enjoy this app
B001NLL93W|5.0|I really love this series - feels little like a mix between Harry Potter and Twilight at times but good story
B004G606K8|5.0|I read Dragons of Autumn Twilight when I was a teenager and absolutely loved it.  Looking for a little nostalgia after seeing &#34;Community's&#34; &#34;Advanced Dungeons & Dragons&#34; episode I downloaded this classic.  Certainly doesn't hold up to more recent works and it is a bit elementary, but hey it's a D&D book written for the D&D audience.  An audience that is full of 40 something people today but not back in the 90's, we were all teenagers back then.  Still entertaining and a super fast read.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great read to get your young adult into the fantasy genre it's a great choice.  While the classic LOTR can seem daunting to some younger readers, and the modern classic SOF&I certainly leans towards Adult and not Young, the Dragonlance Chronicles make for the perfect fit.  Plus if you are in your 40's now, the books are sure to bring back memories of simpler times; when video games came on floppy disks and books were, well, Books.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|good book - good story line, hard to put it down.  I lost track of time while reading it and loved it
0545265355|5.0|Do i even need to say it?, the three Books are great, better than the movie. And hard cover !!!
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Mediocre story and acting by some talented actors.  The movie demonstrates how hard these actors work at keeping their bodies in tip top shape, but that's all.
0061537969|5.0|This story was recommended to me due to the fact that I am a huge animal lover.  This story roped me in almost immediately.  I loved every page and read the entire book in one day.  I thought there was just a little too much information on the mechanics of race cars and racing but it did not take away from the story which I absolutely adored.  I immediately ordered his other novel, Raven Stole the Moon and have just started reading it.  I hope this author keeps the stories coming.  I look at my dog in another way entirely and love her even more.
B006MPKDUE|5.0|I ENJOY READING M.C.s books and i have no particular like or dislike for any part of the book i would recommend this book to any one who likes a good well written story.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Lightweight and repetitive chapters. I got bored and wanted to fast-forward. The story line was ok but this was not a satisfying read for me
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This book is a classic and was required reading for my 7th grader - but I also read it again and loved it!
B008ELUEQC|3.0|I'd expect more inovation from this rocker, even on traditional pieces.  His AllAmericanSong<br />books and SoulBokk had more Rod Stewart!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The Wraiths of Eden is awesome. Graphics are nice and the story line is great also.  Works great on kf Thanks G5
0446618322|3.0|But I was disappointed.  The dog stuff was really unrealistic, as was the romance.  I guess it is typical Nicholas Sparks.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game ...<br />This is one oh the most fun games I play. If you get a chance to play it I would try.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This just I don't know how to say it but it's the best office app it works app good works with googls drive and its very easy to use
B0084IG7KC|5.0|It was what I bought. The blu-ray quality is much better than an original DVD. Worth the little bit of extra money.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It's a page turner. Very much written in her Jodi Picoult style, and very reminiscent of her book Nineteen Minutes.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I positively loved this book. It perfectly showed the difference between good and evil. But no matter how much evil has happened, everything will recover.
1449410243|4.0|Loved this book.  I think my cats are exactly like the crazy ones that are talked about in this book. Very funny!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely amazing such a great book recommend!!!! I finished this in two days I could not  stop reading! Haven't read such a good book in a while
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read all of his books, he never has a bad book. I will continue to read whatever he writes next.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|When my order came, I was thrilled with the look of the packaging, since I have coveted this series from the beginning and used to rent DVDs as they came out, but my rental store only carried the first two seasons.  I am enjoying the accompanying book outlining the various episodes, and like the commentaries.<br /><br />The only thing I am VERY unhappy with is that the front flap with the seal came unglued and required repair.<br /><br />Thank you for shipping so fast.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book, it emphasizes the nature of the seals not just the fact they captured a terrorist. I would recommend this book to all
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Really Enjoyed This Movie Christen Bale And Morgan Freeman Really Played Great Roles in the film.  Love All The Action Also
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I am not generally someone who reads for fun but this book kept me engaged from beginning to end.  I would recommend it to any one who is looking for an entertaining and exciting read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much. It is great for passing time this game is my favorite game  ever!!<br /><br />This game
1604502703|5.0|Life changing material.<br /><br />I've practiced the ideas for almost 2 years now and it works amazingly well.<br /><br />You will benifit from reading and listening to book and audio cd's.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|This game is original and the gameplay is easy to master. There are multiple levels so it will keep you playing for awhile. It's basically a puzzle game by which you guide a mouse with a scent of cheese avoiding any hindrances. Young children and adults alike will enjoy this creative app.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Jack Reacher is the man.  I like a good manly, man who can take on anything and still get his butt whipped occasionally.  A real thriller.  I couldn't put it down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely amazing! This book shows just how much a person can through and still overcome everything. This book represents true love and passion. It's a great read for any age. Not to mention it keeps you guessing and on edge.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I've read just the first 2 books (hoping the 2nd would be better) and find them to be repititious to the point of boring. The relatively thin plot becomes even thinner when sandwiched between far-too-numerous, explicit sex machinations--redundancy and overkill. What could, perhaps, have been a more intriguing series becomes ho-hum. The sex becomes gratituitous. As with hearing too many repetitions of profanity, any power inherent in bizarre sex descriptions becomes weak.
B0045H6V8Y|5.0|We have seen this movie a few times and enjoy it immensely every time.  This was one of the better roles for both Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman.  And the boy (Brandon Walters) is especially captivating in this movie.  A must see!<br /><br />We watched it through Amazon Prime Instant Videos through Roku with perfect HD clarity and home theater surround sound.  Worked out great!
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Funniest show on television in a long time!  The interaction between characters is well scripted.  Even though some of the physics commentary is incorrect it still provides great entertainment.
0374214913|2.0|As someone with feet planted firmly in both old and new knowledge, I was excited at the premise of this book: a bookstore clerk who has stumbled into a secret society that may or may not be unraveling metaphysical secrets that would change the world. It's a good setup: a naive clerk, a quirky bookstore owner, a potentially antagonistic patron. But characters aren't fleshed out much. A romance is thrown in there almost haphazardly. And the author is WAAAYYYY too much of a Google fanboy.<br />It almost felt at the end that the author thought \\"OH CRAP I NEED TO END THIS WITH A CURVE\\" and that's what he did. Not even a very satisfying one.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|The movie adaptation is not too bad in this one.  One must just realize that the movie and the book are two different representations on the same subject.  Both formats are great in their own right.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Sent it back.  Arrived with a big scratch on the plastic cover.  Also the case completely ruined the audio quality of the iphone - caused a tinny rattling sound.  Hubby has a lifeproof case bought from an ATT store and has  no issues with it, so I wonder about the authenticity of this one.
B0058BI896|5.0|Funniest show on television in a long time!  The interaction between characters is well scripted.  Even though some of the physics commentary is incorrect it still provides great entertainment.
B005LAII12|3.0|Don't waste your time purchasing this one. Very few funny parts. The main actor was good but I wouldn't care to see it again....ever,
B004WMKSH2|5.0|The ending part 1 is done very well.  One must realize that the film and the book are two DIFFERENT artist representations on the same subject.  Whether the film closely follows the book or not is irrelevant; both formats are great in their own right.
B0009VJWKY|1.0|This group showed up as a recommendation for me because I bought (and love) David Garrett's work. I took the bait, and have wasted my time and money. This is m...i...l..e...s away from Garrett. Just junk music. Sounds as if somebody just added violin tracks to studio music. I would never buy this again and would prefer a refund.
B005GET448|4.0|Great Read. Different way of looking at things. Time to wake up and see &#34;aid&#34; for what it really is.
B001UW58WW|5.0|This virtuoso took modern music and helped me discover it. One of my favorites is the theme from Pirates of the Caribbean. It always lifts my spirits.
0547569653|5.0|I wanted to improve on the marathon time so I have been interested in learning how the elite runners do it....this book is just what I was looking for. Scott Jurek gave me a &#34;look&#34; into the mind of a ultra marathoner....I am trying to figure out &#34;what makes them tick&#34;. I am also interested in eating healthier to become a better runner; Scott gives recipes and shares his experience on becoming a vegetarian. I enjoyed the book and plan on reading it again and again and again.......
006074748X|5.0|I read it when it first came out and one particular scene has stuck with me over all those decades. I wanted to read it again, and I'm glad I did. She draws such beautiful pictures.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Couldn't put it down, even though at times it seemed that i should of, it was very interesting. I definitely enjoyed it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The story kept me engaged through the entire account. The ending was a grand surprise and one that I did not anticipate.  Ms. Collins' skill at writing about futuristic warfare methods was chilling and diabolical. The Hunger Games trilogy was worth my time. I feel that the books need to be read in order for the full enjoyment of the story.
0060594896|5.0|I really liked this book. It is a little on the longer side of things being a little under 500 pages, however there is absolutely no filler in this book. Jack sets up the daily principles of success perfectly. Do not make the mistake of assuming this book doesn't work simply because you have a lack of commitment.
B0091XRPTQ|4.0|My 4 year old lives this movie, and likes the book.  I find it a little creepy, not a fan of this style of animation, a little too 'real'.  Above movie for the holidays all in all.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It is fun for little it  kids and for young adults you should buy this game it is fun for all ages too
B002361MLA|5.0|Eckhart is an amazing teacher. This book will change your life & make you realize that it's not \\"your life\\". You ARE life.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|like to fast play, nicemusic and easy on the eyes...like to play to unwind.  look forward to playing ona dailybasis.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Starting out on Pats journey it is obvious how emotionally and mentally unstable he really is. So you find yourself truly caring about the character. Then somewhere in his messed up ramblings, you begin to relate and maybe are a little alarmed by this. All in all I thought it was a great story. Very unique, which is difficult to find. My only concern was that at times the author made Pats thoughts very child like. I really didn't feel that was the case with Pat, and that a more adult approach would have been a better fit.
B009MO57H6|5.0|Okay Ive seen this series over and over again from part one to four about a hundred times. Cant get enough of it!!! Everytime its on tv I watch it,,,when I found out they made a part five I was saying awsome for ever until it was released on dvd which I had to buy right then and there. Would go see it at thearters but daddy dont like scary movies he says they are bad blah blah blah... I well take a night or nightmares just to watch this...So far I have not watched the fifth movie I am watching the entire series over again so I well be updated on what is going on in the fifth movie I well do a update after I watch the latest and hopefully not last RE movie...<br /><br />UPDATE 7/20/2013<br />Took me a while to get to this review I have seen this movie more then once it was pleasant to see a alternate universe in this movie no spoilers on how that happened...I would pick this up again and again if I needed to I have all five movies and would not trade them for anything in the universe. This movie was awesome Alice rocks she is so brave and a good fighter the only thing that comes close to this is Underworld series...you have to go out and get this movie you wont be disappointed!!!!! Smile God's watchin =)
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Spoiler alert!  This is the entire film: oh no, he's about to die.  oh no, he's about to die.  oh no, he's about to die.  yay, he saved the world.<br /><br />Is this an exaggeration?  Not really.  There wasn't much of anything original in this film.  I've never seen the original Total Recall so I can't compare them.  But I can compare this film to others I've seen and it's basically a Bourne Identity wannabe rip-off set in an unconvincing and uncreative future.<br /><br />Almost no imagination went into the portrayal of the future.  Robot cops that can't do anything reasonable, such as shoot their target successfully?  If I were to imagine martial robots, they would have TASERS built into them (why fight with *fists* when they can just taser somebody??) and they would be able to shoot any target with extreme accuracy.  Hell, they are robots... they should be able to do hundreds of things that humans can't... but not in this movie.  The robots depicted here were just as dumb and worthless as their human counterparts.  The humans even just handed these robots their \\"futuristic\\" guns which are exactly like today's guns, except they magically hold hundreds of rounds.<br /><br />You know it's bad when the director just stops caring about common sense.  Go into the \\"No Zone\\" with nothing but a WWI gas mask?  Nerve agents (look up \\"Sarin\\" or \\"VX\\") and other chemical weapons will immediately begin to affect you just from skin contact.  But no hazmat suits here.  Apparently all you need is a loose fitting leather gas mask and you're good to go.<br /><br />But at least the director threw in the obligatory shot of a touch-interactive refrigerator.  Didn't see that one coming!<br /><br />I wanted to like this movie, but there was simply nothing to like.  Every cliché imaginable was thrown together and that's about it.  It's a shame because when it comes to sci-fi and especially memory thrillers, the sky is the limit.  But there's nothing new here.  Just a bunch of BS.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Awesome software - available on kindle, phone and computer and notes are there for you to access and review or edit!  Love it!
B0060MYK7G|3.0|The Borgias, despite all the bloodshed, is a pretty film which is nice to watch but I feel the actors are going through their paces without much interest in what they're doing.  This made me wonder whether Irons and Jacobi (I guess he was in the first series) are out of pocket money and needed  pick-up jobs.  It isn't that their acting was bad (they are both too good to deliver truly bad acting) just lackluster.  Seemed a waste of their formidable talents
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I bought this as soon as I finished book 1. It's such a gripping tale that I had to keep it going.
B008602KQI|1.0|Have not recieved the Hunger games, very disapointed... And did not find a contact number to find out the problem
B008N9AASC|5.0|Nothing on TV; need to relax, don't want to contend with teh blah blah blah of network TV? This is the perfect solution. The filming and scenes are epic all surrounded by beautiful music. Which they had some way to show you where each part was filmed.
0545425115|5.0|For 3 nights in a row, I stayed up later than usual compelled to finish THG. Then I want on to Catching Fire and Mockingjay... All 3 books were incredible...
B00009R86L|5.0|As published, this did the job, very comfortable. Fast mail service and secure packaging. This is a great replacement for shoulder strap pad. Does not come with a strap, this is only the pad.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|I chose this rating because this movie was part of a Christmas gift; they love the movie!  Thank you for making it reasonable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Some of plot lines are predictable but superb acting and each episode leaves you wanting more and ready to hit the &#34;play one more&#34; button
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Was so pleased to have given it to my Granddaughter! Along with the doll, she now has two items to add to her collection.<br /><br />Thanks for getting it to me in time for Christmas!! Your service is always top notch!!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I like this case very much.  I can stand my Kindle up without holding it.  I also like the color--white.  Patty D. San Francisco CA
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was not prepared to be as engulfed with this book as I was. I read it in 6 hours.
B008220DGE|5.0|I was blown away by this film. The psychological realism is very demented and disturbing. I can understand why many are turned off by it. I talked to one person who said they didn't like the movie because the main characters had no redeeming qualities. Well, that's why I like the movie. So to see the film as a masterpiece first requires one to have a certain taste, to have an appreciation of characters and drama that are not attractive. Yes, the characters are disgusting, evil people, played ridiculously well by the actors. Yes, the psychological drama is absurd and revolting. This is an extremely dark film, I'd say much darker than PTA's last outing. It delves deep into human psychology, especially qualities of fear, delusion, exploitation, and rage, uncharted territory that is not commonly explored in mainstream cinema. Most do not want to explore these qualities of humanness at such an intimate level, most go to the movies for escapism and do not find as much entertainment in such forced introspection. Anyway, this film is the best I've seen in a long time. I expect it will be talked about for ages, reevaluated throughout the years and shown to be a stunning portrait of the underbelly of Americana.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It was not as good as the Bourne Trilogy. Didn't like that they changed the agents to being on drugs.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|its kinda hard to rate a streeming movie, but ok well i rented this streeming vid and its absoultly hilarious
B000F8O35U|5.0|I was worried about how well this movie will play since it was used but it met all my expectations the movie played excellent had a few scratches but really light scratches, plays great. My daughter loves this movie.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Love all the Star Trek series.  This is the third I've purchased.  The cases are much better for storage this time than Voyager or Generations.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Once I got acclimated to the flow of the book, I couldn't put it down. I'm fascinated by the evil and horror humans inflict on each other and this book didn't disappoint.  And it was framed in a truly great story. I also learned plenty about OCD! Can't wait to read more from this author.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show, and I love watching it with no commercials! I can't wait to see more of it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Addicting... actually made me sign up for Facebook after resisting to do that for this whole time... the objects you have to find more around so it's not the same room every time.
1439102813|5.0|my wife said that the book was fantastic and she could not put it down until she finished it.<br />she was very disapointed at how long it took for the book to arrive ( ordered Dec 16th arrived Jan 14th )
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Amazon Kindle Fire 5ft USB cable is heavy duty and more sturdier.  I love it and charges a lot more rapidly.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|If you liked &#34;24&#34; and twists and turns, this is a view worth taking. The whole first season leaves you guessing, but in a good way. Trying to figure out the allegiances of the main characters is the challenge you are tasked with.
B009E3EWPI|4.0|Camera jumps around way too much.  It would be nice to sit in the front and enjoy the show for more than half a second at a time. It would have been better to be able to select the angle desired and switch it when you want rather than have 16 different angles bombard you over and over again every minute.
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|Always an exciting viewing adventure. Seeing it on Blu-ray beats the original viewing experience on TV. This is the last of the series, sorry to see it end.
0920668372|5.0|I bought two copies of this book because I want to give it to my two adult sons.  It is so cute and expresses so well the love I feel for them.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Epic movie I wish the show was around a little longer to tell more about this story 'Firefly' was an epic show..  I was really happy that it came swiftly/promptly in the mail.<br /><br />Thanks again!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Andy writes how I think.. which could indicate I need Psych Help ASAP. Let's face it, he's alone, trapped and making the best of it. In the book, I mean. Def a great read.  I look forward to future insanity from this cool author.
1423140605|5.0|this rating is based on my 13 year old son's opinion. he has read all of these books and loves this one. good action, character development and an easy read!
B00464CU7M|4.0|A little too showy, but okay for fans.  Katherine shows versatility with her voice. Check out her other DVD's - they focus more on the voice, and less on the show.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Sir, I hadn't known about Operation Redwing before reading your account. I am grieved but extremely proud of your team's performance. Those few moments really did suck. Glad you made it.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I love it, was waiting for his album to come out!  I watched him on American Idol the whole season, and was happy that he won.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I don't understand all the hype and 4/5 star ratings.  This is the most horrible zombie book I've ever read, and I've read a LOT of them!  I was expecting a lot more because of all the talk about this book, and boy was I disappointed.<br /><br />This is not really a coherent book at all.  This is a disjointed, pointless mess of personal anecdotes from around the globe without any central characters or plot.  For as long as it is you would think there would be more detail about the spread, conquest etc of the zombie plague, but this too is lacking.  I don't see how this can be a movie unless they're going to just write an entirely new script as is commonplace nowadays.  This is one case where the horrible movie might actually be BETTER than the horrible book.<br /><br />I was similarly disappointed with Brooks' Survival Guide which I read first, although that at least had some interesting information and amusing thoughts.
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|Love the story.  Robert Redford and Mia Farrow are wonderful.  As I have watched this movie several times, I decided to purchase the DVD.
B000003N7K|5.0|One of the best recordings in my collection.  I heard one of the tracks from this cd in the background at a party or somewhere and I had to hear more.  I do not consider myself to be a big jazz buff, but this recording is simply captivating.  Hartman's voice is so clear and distinct that you feel like you are in the studio with he and Coltrane.  And the sax, of course, is flawless.  Anyone who has a serious interest in music needs to own this recording.  And anyone who fancies themselves a singer could learn something from the clarity and annunciation of Hartman's divine baritone.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is my favorite author.  I watch for his next book and am never disappointed.  He keeps you on the edge of the seat from beginning to end.
B0026772N8|3.0|I have only gotten thru half of the book---perhaps I should hold off my rating till I finish it and then rate it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing!!!!! I have never been disappointed with Nicholas sparks. I love love stories and he always adds excitement to it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A very good, fast-paced work.  With just enough detail to allow the reader to appreciate what was happening, the author is able to keep the action moving.  I only wish a glossary of military acronyms had been included.  I could remember most but not all of them.  I would recommend this book to anyone with an appreciate for the military and/or current events
074322454X|5.0|The TV series was one of mine and my husband's favorates. We got a copy to share with our future son-in-law.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am a pretty avid reader but never been into the fantasy genre. So when someone recommended this series to me I was reluctant to get on the bandwagon. I got the free sample and that was the end of my sanity! I ready all 5 books in a about 4 months and have watched the series on HBO which is pretty good I must say. I have tried to move on with my life and start another book while waiting for the next one but all I can do is think about what happens to the characters in this series! They have become part of my life in a way that no other series has done since Odd Thomas by Dean Koontz. I highly recommend this to everyone I know!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|When I found I could get this on its day of release, I was thrilled. Thanks Amazon! This copy was for our daughter who is majoring in French. She cried all the way through the movie. So did I. So did her Dad. I think I am going to have to buy another copy -- for myself! The best movie ever. Amazing music.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|with all the hoopla about this show, it had been on my wish list!!!! OK, I just thought it was horrible to see naked men being beaten. I woke up seeing that! and just from the get go of the first episode, I noticed bad timing and  dead air.  maybe, the show gets better. but i was not impressed with the first episode.  the wife at home and all that gratuitous sex with her! I see what a reviewer meant by soft porn.  If I wanted to see breasts, I'd buy a \\"tittie magazine!\\" Seriously, I'm a woman who watches dvds with her boyfriend and I wanted a good STORY to watch that draws you and characters whom you love or love to hate!!!!! Seriously, isnt that what we all want.  If I wanted to watch soft porn, I guess I'd subscribe to Showtime, ha, ha.<br /><br />OK, well, we don't have tv reception, at all, so we ended up watching more, and liking it. Now, we are going to buy season 2, eventually. Now, my gentlemanly boyfriend, supposedly, covers his eyes. I still don't want to see Ashley Judd naked, because, that's not why I watch tv, and, obviously, it does bother me, because I just want to be entertained and relax and enjoy tv with my boyfriend like a relaxing date night. So when purchasing dvd sets, which, I do constantly, it makes a big difference in me wanting to purchase ones that Im not offended by. Also, I compared the story to the Odyssey but would not ever be able to tell a student what show I was watching when they asked me!!!!!!<br /><br />So we did end up getting really into the story, which, becomes well-developed, and Claire Danes and the actor are both very good performers and, now, I'm into the show and plan to buy season 2.  but, seriously, you don't have to take your clothes off, if you can act.<br /><br />and if you have a good show, people will watch, SHOWTIME, so clean it the eff up!
B007SGM084|5.0|What a steamy page turner!  Wondering when the that's it  \\"for now\\" is coming?!<br />Can't wait for it···Hoping it'll be just as steamy
1847879071|5.0|This book has helped me and several of my peers get through their dissertation! Field's examples can be easily transferred to your own data, and he walks you through the steps in SPSS. His embedded humor in each example takes out the dry descriptions you find in most stat books. When you are beating your head against your keyboard trying to make your stats run, his chapters will still make you smile. Recommended 100%
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Good book makes u think about what district you would be in and if you would be able to survive the games
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent book!!!! I love it!!! Just perfect!!!! Is the best book somebody can read, I can't stop reading it, it's just AWESOME!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was my least favorite book in the series. The story takes a major political turn from the initial story of the hunger games. In this story its about power and good versus bad. Who really is good? I was curious to see how the story ended and that is why I read it all but overall I was pretty disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was the best book I have ever read and now I am going to buy book two I, love it, Suzanne Collins.
0736092269|4.0|This book is exactly what I was looking for, shows you what muscles you work when doing particular exercise. The only downside is I wish they had more exercises in it, but this is a great book to have on hand.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always loved playing Solitaire while growing up. My mother taught me to play and I thought it was great because you did not need someone else to be able to play.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I played this on the dreamcast as a child and I'm extreamly happy they made it on the kindle so worth the money if you are intristed in some quality original games
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I loved this book.  However I warn anyone looking to get into this series that the 4th and 5th have gotten horrible reviews.  I have read the 4th and agree with them.  I'm boycotting the 5th and won't read any more from this author unless he does a better job with one of the remaining sequels.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We love this movie because it shows how to overcome and be who & what God wants you to be - the best father, the best mother. It also shows how leaning on Him & casting our cares on Him will bring us through the trials of life.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I loved this book.  However I warn anyone looking to get into this series that the 4th and 5th have gotten horrible reviews.  I have read the 4th and agree with them.

B009JBZH54|5.0|This Limited Edition of the Dark Knight Trilogy is a must-have product for any comic book geek that enjoys superhero stories. The package contains 5 blu ray discs and a 64-pages abridged booklet from the artbook 'The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy', which provides great information and awesome concept art regarding the making of the trilogy at hand.<br /><br />The only advice that I might add to die-hard fans collectors is that, according to a code for discount, an upcoming Ultimate Collector's Edition will be release this year, aside with further memorabilia. If you prefer to get more collectibles added to your purchase you should wait for that one. although it may or may not be worth the wait, since the price for this collection is awesome for 3 blu ray discs movies plus 2 blu ray discs with special features for The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises (special features for Begins are included within the same disc).<br /><br />For me this is a pretty solid collection that you won't regret purchasing.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Enjoined it throughly.  I really like the stories that you want to follow. Most games you skip what you can to get back to the game. This one makes you want to hear the entire story.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|I absolutely loved the first three books in this series.  After reading several negative reviews on this book I was hesitant, but how bad could it be right?  I really wish I had never started this series of books.  This book was so bad that I wish I could unread the first 3 and not be &#34;into&#34; this series.  There are plenty of other reviews that give spoilers so go read them if you want the details.  I am boycotting the next book (already published) and waiting for reviews of the 6th to see if the author pulls his head out.  I have concluded that the authors propensity for killing off the heroes isn't a clever plot twist, but simply his inability to fully develop a story to the end (or even the middle).  Unless the sixth book gets great reviews, I recommend simply stopping after the third and being content with an unfinished story.
0375869026|5.0|I wanted to read this before I gave it to my  9 year old granddaughter and now I consider it one of my all time favorite books.  It made me laugh and made me cry and it was very heart warming.  This is a book that teachers may want to read to the class as it is so full of life lessons and would open up many classroom discussions!
B000HCO83Q|5.0|I am very happy that this movie was still available. I know have all of the series and am grateful for its good codition as well.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A little overwhelming with engineering jargon but other than that I didn't want to it to end.  Will read Andy edit more often.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I am very happy that this movie is still available and in such good condition. I could not beat the price either.
0525457585|5.0|The Neverending story is an amazing book, much deeper and more vibrant then the movies based upon it, and engaging for all ages.  I highly highly recommend anyone read this book, and look forward to reading it with my children now that I have my own copy.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|\\"Zero Dark 30\\" is an account of the CIA's decade-long hunt for Osama bin Laden, culminating in the raid on his compound in Pakistan. Jessica Chastain portrays Maya, a red-haired beauty who initially appears fragile and vulnerable. As time passes, she toughens up, uses four-letter words liberally, and spits out her opinions when she is angry (which is often). Maya is obsessed with locating and killing Bin Laden, whom she calls UBL. She and her colleagues follow up every lead, no matter how flimsy, since even a courier could be the key to discovering UBL's hiding place.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow has garnered a great deal of criticism in the wake of this movie's release. First, there are the infamous scenes in which CIA operatives transport detainees to \\"black sites,\\" where the captors beat their prisoners repeatedly; deprive them of sleep, food, and drink; pour water over their faces to simulate the feeling of being drowned; and string them up by their wrists. Bigelow asserts that she does not personally endorse torture as a means of obtaining information. Furthermore, she insists that although the movie is based on actual events, she uses artistic license to tell her story.<br /><br />Is \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" worth seeing? Yes, for a number of reasons, including the edgy screenplay by Mark Boal, Greg Fraser's superb cinematography, Jeremy Hindle's impressive production design, and Alexandre Desplat's evocative score. Bigelow's direction is gutsy, fast-paced, and powerful. There are no opening credits, just a dark screen with the sounds of 9/11 assaulting our senses. She then segues to the infamous and grisly torture sequences, but leaves it to us to decide whether such extreme interrogation methods can ever be morally justified.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain shines as a brittle and hot-tempered individual who, as far as we know, has no friends, family, or outside interests to distract her from her grim and difficult task. Jason Clarke, another CIA operative, taunts and torments detainees, but is smart enough to realize that he harms himself by engaging in such tactics. Reda Kateb is excellent as a stubborn captive who does his best to withstand degradation and pain in his determination to protect his secrets. James Gandolfini is fierce and savvy as former CIA director Leon Panetta; he demands proof of Osama bin Ladin's whereabouts, and is not content with probabilities and suppositions. Kyle Chandler, Maya's stressed-out boss, knows that he will take the fall if things go belly-up.<br /><br />This provocative film demonstrates how difficult it is to glean solid intelligence concerning potential terror attacks. Monitoring emails and telephone calls; following the wire transfers of known jihadists who need a steady supply of funds; and conducting video surveillance to monitor the movements of people of interest may yield useful data. However, analysts such as Maya, who are experienced in the ways that terrorists think and behave, also play a crucial role. It is fascinating to see how the changing political winds in Washington influence the CIA's policies. Finally, the takedown of Bin-Laden by Seal Team Six is mesmerizing. \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" invites us to discuss some of the toughest dilemmas that face us as a democratic society under siege.orments detainees, but is smart enough to realize that he harms himself by engaging in such tactics.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is always popular and this version is a well put together run at the game.  The controls feel comfortable, the layout is clean and all in all, a good app.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Books one and two were GREAT! The third one not so much. I saw the movie first and though it was great, but then I read the book and the movie is nothing compared to the book. I am not a teenager by any means but I still enjoyed the story line and I read the last book really slowly (which was hard to do since I was so into the series) just because I didn't want it to end.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I cannot find complaint with the Angry Buirds series of games and Space added a lot of new features that made the game seem very fresh and even more challenging at times.  Working around gravity wells and spatial objects was  nice touch.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|but I can't get into it. I even skipped forward to a &#34;steamy &#34; scene to try to get an idea of what I was in for and raise my interest in the book but, nope, its just not for me.
0765325950|5.0|This book dragged me in and didn't let go for the whole 900 page stretch.  I wanted to cry, laugh, and cheer along with the action, and I was left maudlin at the end because the series was done.  There are so many things left in this vivid world that could be delved into and with the Author being deceased, we'll be left to imagine it instead.  A great end to an amazing saga.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|very fun wish it was more challenging but it was exciting loved the story line I wish the game had been a bit longer
B008I34ZFW|5.0|This is a fun B-Movie and totally worth it.  The day I bought it, it take out on Netflixs but I still bought it.  Thanks!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I cannot wait for the last installment in this trilogy!!!  Having traveled in Europe, many of the places he writes about are very real to me.  I love the families in these books and how they are intertwined.  Honestly, this book could be read by itself; however, the background provided in the first book makes it a page turner.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I bought it and never was able to download it I was very disappointed. I do love the game and have it for PC!
B0052T7ICM|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing Rory twice in concert in his prime!<br />He is without a doubt one of the best live performers I have ever seen!<br />The most energy the best guitar licks, but the best part was that he seemed like he<br />was enjoying every minute of it and the audience surely did!<br />photo finish is Rory at his best start to finish! Highly recommended!
B001ILFUD2|5.0|Item was just as described! Perfect condition. One of my favorite movies from my childhood. Great to have it on DVD. Would buy from this seller again thank you!
B00000612P|5.0|this cd is one of my favorites of all time!<br />From the classic Maggie May to the beautiful ballad Mandolin Wind<br />this album has it all! as I stated in my review of After the Gold Rush<br />Buy it! Listen to it! tell others! You won't be disappointed!
B008B68J2G|5.0|My daughter was really happy it's a really detailed toy. She loved the color and details of the toy and that she got it before her friends
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Not a big Killers fan personally. This was a gift for my wife and at 3.99 it was great! She loves it
B005544V6A|5.0|My husband and I started watching this series last year at the start of season 2.  It was easy to keep up with and very refreshing to watch something that required a little thought processing from the viewer.  At the end of the season we really wanted to go back and watch season 1 to fill in the gaps - just for the actual &#34;actor's portrayal&#34; of their characters.  We could follow the story line but wanted to actually see the &#34;clashes&#34; between Harvey and Louis.<br /><br />USA has really offered wonderful original series that surpasses network and premium entertainment channels - i.e. HBO, SHOWTIME, ETC.<br /><br />SUITS, BURN NOTICE, COVERT AFFAIRS, ETC absolutely wonderful, refreshing and awesome acting on this network.
B00005JL2O|5.0|Goldmember! Awesome movie, of course.<br /><br />The quality of the recording and the packaging looks kinda cheap but the movie quality is excellent.
0553385461|2.0|It's very easy getting carried away by our modern day `scientific' priesthood and by the latest `scientific' theories but one must stand still for a moment and see science and its limitations for what it is and see evolution for what it is, an intricate and subtle lie from our scientific dictatorship. For a complete refutation of the big bang model Buy Dr John Hartnett's [PhD] book, \\"Dismantling the big bang\\". Dawkins says his science is like poetry. Now poetry and art has to do with ones imagination, true science has to do with cold facts, not imagination. You see how the `brilliant' \\"scientist\\" of our day fuses imagination and `science' together to form the religion of evolution. It's so easy to get swept away in the propaganda of billions of years described in beautifully decorated artistic diagrams filled with mathematical formulas. But stand back a bit and ask yourself if their artistic diagrams truly fit the facts, or does Creation Science fit the facts. If the universe was billions of years old, why do we still see comets around for comets only lasts thousands, not millions of years? Dr Hawking's mind is a gift from God, but instead of making his gift subject to God's Word, he has used His mind to discredit God's Word, which is indeed a dangerous path to take. In his new book Stephen writes a philosophical book telling us philosophy is dead. That is indeed the outcome when we stray from true science and God's wisdom, we become as fools! Brilliant intellectual fools, but fools none the less.<br /><br />[Atheism as a worldview cannot even get off the ground for it cannot account for the laws of logic, love, human dignity etc. The atheist as can be seen has made up his mind that God does not exist. The atheist throws his toys out of the cot because he is angry with God. Deep down inside every atheist knows there is a God but he suppresses the truth in unrighteousness! Then he lashes out with ad homonym arguments against the Christian because he hates the Christian God .<br /> Let God have the final say, in Psalm 19 God says: `The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handy work. 2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.'<br />The atheist's fallen corrupt heart cannot apprehend the simplicity of God's creation for he has a hardened heart, but that does not excuse him from giving an account of his life before God one day!]
B00129H7VS|5.0|If you wish to see some true WWII heroes in action, Band of Brothers is a wonderful place to begin.
1449410243|5.0|I love this book! I don't regret buying it at all, I found myself relating alot of the content to cats in general. I highly recommend it to any cat owner with a bit of a twisted sense of humour.
0385528752|5.0|Not a timely shipper, but the book did arrive within the 3 week guess-timation and the book is new as stated.
0517543052|5.0|My old copy was so used that it fell apart. Hopefully the new copy will last 15 year before I have to buy a new one.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|In spite of its 2h 45m length, the film never dragged. This is the best of the Batman films by far. In this film the characters were the main focus and not the visual effects. Although the effects were stunning, they were never gratuitous nor distracting. The plot was as you would expect for a hero/villain film but there were a few surprises.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to just about anyone over 10. The violence was superficial and probably much less than most video games.<br /><br />Get a large popcorn and drink, kickback and enjoy.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Absolutely love this album! For the money and you get 26 great songs! But you can't go wrong with Bob Seger at all!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun quick game that is a real challenge. Some of the prizes are hard to achieve but just takes dedication.
B005K17RU0|3.0|The app is very accurate about the weather, but I think there could be a few improvement to the app.
B001VTTRC6|4.0|One of the better dramas to come along in a while. Keeps you focused and guessing as to what has happened and who did it. Terrific individual performances by a number of well known actors and a few new faces
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such an amazing book. Couldn't put down the book!!!!!!! I would definitely recommend that you should read this book. One of my all time favorite books.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Many reviews that I read (after reading the book) were talking about how this is like any other love story. The cover and the title sold me to read it and I did so in a timely manner. I was unable to stop reading this book no matter where I was. Yes, it is a love story. Although being that I read many different genre of books, every story is different and has its own \\"spice\\". This was well written and gives you everything you are looking for in a love story. Saying its like any other romance novel is like saying all mystery books are the same and so on.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|Blu-ray is the way to go with all the Twilight movies.I watch these movies at least once a day,the picture and sound make it seem like you could just reach and touch the actors.
B005LAII08|5.0|My five year old granddaughter loved this movie.  Merida and her bravery helped granddaughter over come her Santa fear and take a picture with Santa.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I am glad that the movie was made in blu-ray, I liked it the first time it was even better in blu-ray.Its an old movie but a good one.

B007JNR4XW|5.0|It was everything I hoped it would be and more. I have seen this movie at least 4 times.Would tell everyone to watch it.
B00979CS50|5.0|What's not to like? If you like a musician that is always changing and pushing the bar higher, this Neil Young CD is for you.
B0017TWUZG|5.0|The second movie just as good as the first. The actors in the movie made it a good second movie.
034580404X|5.0|I loved these books! I was hooked from the begining and could not stop reading until I finished all three.
0525952926|5.0|The first two volumes of the Century Trilogy are great reads espaecially for those who think history is dry. These books put a face on the people who launched us on our current trajectory. You can gleen the origin and meaning of terms that are thrown around carelessly today, like appeasement and Nazi.<br /><br />Impatiently awaiting the next volume.
B0019IB0II|5.0|I loved this book because my mother suffered a stroke, two of her sisters did and my husband's mother had a massive stroke and died four days later.  This book taught me a lot of ways to help the stroke patient feel better and feel like people were hearing them when they couldn't speak.
0525478817|4.0|I recommend this book for young and old. It would help anyone but especially those who have had someone close pass.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The acting is superb and the story line is intense. I can't wait to see more from this show! Bravo!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I sure do miss this show.... I bet it could have gone another four years.  The price was good, and I highly recommend this either as a gift , or for yourself.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This recording is absolutely stunning. Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess have never sounded better, and this recording does them justice. I literally have no words against it. The picture is beautiful, the sound is flawless, and the talent runs rampant. Five stars.
0375714839|5.0|Persepolis chronicles Satrapi's childhood and adolescence in Iran during the revolution and war of the late seventies and early eighties. I was coming along at the same time, but seventh graders in Virginia, U.S.A., did not think about the children in Iran. We knew we were supposed to hate Khomeini for taking the hostages. That's about as far as we got. Of course, I can only speak for myself. I was clueless. In fact, it was Satrapi that first showed me the deeper story, and her books did not come out here until 2003.<br /><br />In a particularly moving thread, Marjane turns her back on God after the death of her uncle. Children may be naturally inclined to believe in God. Religious educators bank on this fact and try to get as much of their convincing done when their prospects are wee. The problem is, when a childhood god does not deliver the perfection which is promised, or perceived as a promise, that God is banished, sometimes forever. In Persepolis, her banished God comes back with Karl Marx at his side for reinforcement. Both of these gray-haired men offer her guidance and inspiration, with mixed results.

0553472836|1.0|Not what I expected from John. What a wasted evening that culminated in a 2am disappointment. If you're romantically inclined than please pass on this one. Although I don't want to know the ending I'll be sure to check the ratings on Amazon before I buy another Grisham book.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|just when I was really into the game it ends!  Its one of the best games I ever played but feel like I was ripped off becvause it is really really short!

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an amazing tale of two people dealing with all the baggage that can be thought of. You find your emotions swinging between rooting for and strongly disliking both Nick & Amy. If you are married or in a committed relationship of any kind, all the feelings they have for each other will be familiar. The writer does an excellent job writing both points of view. Read this book!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The kids love it, I love it, my wife even loves it!  Super fun game and great that it's free too!
0765325950|1.0|I am extremely confident when I am FINALLY able to purchase this book in APRIL I will LOVE IT. However, I am extremely disappointed that I am unable to read it until then. I no longer purchase print books due to space concerns and portability. I do at least 90% of my reading on the go, and have not purchased a paper book in years. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in this decision. I have been a fan of this series for well over a decade. I have re-read the series almost every time a new book was released. I have re-purchased this book series in e-format since I made the decision to read exclusively in e-format. I should not have to wait 3 more months to read the finale to one of my most favorite book series ever!
0765325950|5.0|I found this to be a very satisfying end to the series, with plenty of surprises and well worth the price. It's a whirlwind, a lot of viewpoints and action coming together, and I can't imagine anyone who actually reads it not enjoying themselves. My best suggestion, let the work speak for itself. The quality shows through.<br /><br />What I don't like, though, is the number of people purposely tanking the book because the digital version won't be out until April. I understand that digital is nice, and many can't just lug a hardback version around. Heck, I have and regularly use my kindle, which has all the available Wheel of Time books on it. However, for all the hot air that Harriet McDougal (Jordan's wife) ruined the legacy with her decision, it's the people who are posting the 1-star protest reviews, without having actually read it, actually ruining it.<br /><br />And the sad thing? She originally wanted to delay it over a year, but it's now been delayed until April. Three months, down from at least a full twelve. I'm sorry, but after waiting over two years for this another three months is the deal breaker? That would be called a first-world problem, and these tantrums are doing actual damage to the legacy of what is undoubtedly one of the greatest series' printed. It's spiteful and disgusting.

B002ZG98UA|5.0|This product was great, and I was very pleased with Amazon's pricing and quick delivery. I found &#34;Resident Evil&#34; just recently, and immediately bought all four films. Thanks, Amazon, for letting me do that, and so very inexpensively!

B000QCTNIW|5.0|Previously it was thought that the brain was static and could never change.  Dr. Doidge reports on many instances where the brain has changed completely, overcoming illness, injury and even congenital anomalies.  The book is an obvious buy for aging baby boomers who are working to retain their faculties, stroke victims who need to teach a different part of the brain to do normal movements, and many others.  It is also a book for medical and nursing professionals, and teachers who come in contact with people who have neurological differences.  Lastly it is for anyone wanting to learn about new knowledge of the human body.
0978545095|5.0|This is a fabulous book.  What a story.  I have both of the Vivian Maier books and look forward to the third scheduled to come out in the late fall.  And to top it off when the first book arrived it was damaged and AMAZON replaced it within 48 hours!<br /><br />You rock Amazon!<br /><br />Jackie
B006LSZECO|3.0|thought the concept was good,but the ending left me wanting to throw the book if it wasn't on my Kindle!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|For people who liked Hunger Games, Game of Thrones or SciFi in general, good basis to kickoff the series. Protagonist is 16 and supporting characters are about the same age. Can't wait to check out 2ns and 3rd books. Quick read, fast paced.
B00005JMCN|4.0|A great cast - Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, Tobey Maguire and Elizabeth Banks just soar in this well told story. It'll tug at your heart strings, and you'll thank them for it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I truly enjoyed watching it and I suspect you will too. If you enjoy the time frame of WW2, seeing some of the gear used by the soldiers, then  you should enjoy this. Nicely packaged in a metal box for safe keeping.

B001ECQ75A|4.0|I'm really, really not an animated movie fan, but I was looking for a present for my 3 granddaughters who live far away, so purchased a few that seemed to have good reviews. WOW! If Kung Fu Panda (1 & 2) are examples, I may need to buy a lot more!<br /><br />Kung Fu Panda (1) was funny, acerbic, witty, sad, and completely enthralling! Watching a roly-poly panda begin to learn kung-fu is side-splitting, especially for those of us who are a bit roly-poly ourselves! :)<br /><br />The voices for the various characters could not be more spot on. Jack Black has raised the bar for animation voices so high I'm not sure it will ever be beat!!! (I will add an aside here for Andy Serkis' performance as Gollum/Smeagol in LOTR however, although, technically, I don't consider that \\"animation\\" such as this. Gollum was on another level entirely!)<br /><br />One slight note of caution; 1 of my granddaughters is 2 1/2, and I think this may be just a little too much fighting for her. It should be fine for 4 or 4 1/2 +, though.

B00756GKBA|3.0|I am a Huge Madonna Fan & I Love All Of Her Albums- Except for Her Album 'MDNA', which is Disappointing to put it politely. Forget Buying this Album if you're not a Madonna Fan, & Think Twice even if you are! This Album had Three Official Singles 'Give Me All Your Luvin', 'Girl Gone Wild', & 'Turn Up the Radio'- all 3 Singles were Universal Flops, A First for any Madonna Album. You get the Feeling That This Album Was Made In A Rush & That Madonna's Heart Wasn't Really In It. This is a Madonna Album that I had Patiently Waited for, and I had Really High Hopes for it especially when I heard that 'ROL' Producer William Orbit was Involved- but Sadly this Album is Almost an Entirely Lame Electro-Dance Album. A Number Of 'Current Producers' Were Involved in the Creation of the 'MDNA' LP, however it Doesn't Sound Fresh or Unique- Madonna is Usually A Leader & Not A Follower in the Music Field. This Album is Light Years Away from the Amazing Sonics and Sophisticated Lyrics of the 'Ray Of Light' Album, and Despite being a Dance Album it Doesn't Capture the Fun and Euphoria of Dancing the way she did so well on her 'Confessions On A Dancefloor' Album. The Weakest Element of 'MDNA' is Without Doubt the Very Basic Lyrics, they are So Simplistic they sound like English is Madonna's Second Language. Some people may argue that her lyrics have always been plain but I disagree- Her Best Albums 'Like A Prayer', 'True Blue', 'Bedtime Stories' , 'Ray of Light', 'Erotica' contain songs with Great Lyrical Depth- Her Latest Album is Full of Lyrical Cliches & She has Little to Say. \\"MDNA\\" Contains Two Nice Ballads, A Rarity On a Madonna Album In Recent Times- 'Masterpiece' Is Beautiful & 'Falling Free' is Sublime. The Album Contains Three Additional Good Songs, namely 'Turn Up The Radio', 'Girl Gone Wild', & 'Best Friend'.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A very good read, a different kind of story with love, friendship and loyalty. I could not put it down
0440217563|5.0|This book is the 3rd in a serries and is an excellent book! You really need to read the first 2 books in order to understand this one, but the whole series is a hard to put the book down type, intense, adventure & romance along with time-travel! A historical novel that takes starts in Scotland 1942 & Scotland 1742, read the series to find out more! :)

B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Holy 80s batman!    You know when you get a bunch of nerds together and you run out of things to talk about and then someone mentions an old video game or computer they saw recently, or a mame console they just built, and it triggers a rush of \\"the first computer game I ever played...\\", and \\"my first computer was a...\\", in a game of one-upmanship for who loves the machine the most, and who began the love affair the earliest? Well, here's an entire book of that. If just reading this post makes you want to talk about old computer games, you'll probably love the book.    I'm a nerd and born within a decade of Ernie Cline, so I was perfectly poised to enjoy this mega-buffet of computer game and geek nostalgia from the 80s. That's where I was, a few paragraphs in, rolling around in glorious appeals to nostalgia. But by the time I'd read the very detailed and thorough explanation of the easter egg and Halliday's quest, I was mad. Despite being immensely appealing to children of the 70s and 80s the book is written for 13 year-olds.    If only Cline could STOP EXPLAINING EVERYTHING IN GREAT BORING DETAIL. Seriously. You don't need to spell out every aspect of the quest at the start of the book, you are treating your readers like dribbling idiots. The book should have started with Wade climbing out of his trailer and going to his secret OASIS-enabled lair. Everything else you could figure out from context, in fact, doing the figuring-out is one of the best parts of reading.    So the beginning is just a bit weak, but the rest is OK right? No. Cline goes around hitting everything with the explanation hammer. What's the point of geek references if you explain them all? They should be fewer and subtle so that regular readers aren't bothered by them, but people in the know get a kick out of them. Instead the story flow is often destroyed with mini Wikipedia-like entries. This reference was already pretty lame but the explanation makes it worse:    \\"I memorized lyrics. Silly lyrics, by bands with names like Van Halen, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, and Pink Floyd. I kept at it. I burned the midnight oil. Did you know that Midnight Oil was an Australian band, with a 1987 hit titled \\"Beds Are Burning\\"?\\"    At one point Cline (via Wade) goes on a bizarre rant about all the things he wishes he'd been told in (I assume) some sort of hard-knocks atheist parenting school where every kid gets a lump of coal carved with a likeness of Charles Darwin for Christmas:    \\"Here's the deal Wade. You're something called a 'human being'. That's a really smart kind of animal. Like every other animal on this planet we're descended from a single-celled organism that lived millions of years ago. This happened by a process called evolution, and you'll learn more about it later. But trust me, that's really how we all got here. There's proof of it everywhere, buried in the rocks. That story you heard? About how we were all created by a super-powerful dude named God who lives up in the sky? Total bulls***. The whole God thing is actually an ancient fairy tale that people have been telling one another for thousands of years. We made it all up. Like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny. Oh, and by the way...there's no Santa Claus or Easter Bunny. Also bulls***. Sorry, kid. Deal with it.\\"    Of course the whole thing is very meta: a novel about an easter egg and a videogame quest that itself contains an easter egg and a videogame quest, with a real-world DeLorean as a prize that Wade drives in the novel...    But enough complaining, and time to own up: I actually really liked it. There were plenty of annoyances, but I was still up at all hours reading to see how the quest for the next gate would play out. Any novel that grabs your attention like that is pretty special, so I'm giving it a high score despite all the flaws.    I'll leave you with some of my favourite geek culture references. I felt like high-fiving someone when Wade speaks his OASIS pass-phrase to log in, which was:\\"You have been recruited by the Star League to defend the Frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada.\\"    I was also happy about my second-favourite piece from the Star Wars score (behind the Cantina) getting a place as the victory music for completing the first challenge:    \\"I recognized the music. It was the last track from John Williams' original Star Wars score, used in the scene where Princess Leia gives Luke and Han their medals (and Chewbacca, as you may recall, get the shaft).\\"    4 stars.

Looking forward to his new book I think to be released in May 13'
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book caught my eye a while ago, since for some time it has been very near the top of Amazon's \\"Average Customer Review\\" book search - no mean feat with 1,391 reviews. Incidentally the current #1 book in that search is the excellent With The Old Breed. Our nascent sci-fi book club, yes you heard right, decided that was a good enough reason to put it on the list, and I'm glad we did.<br /><br />Howey self-published the first novella, but you wouldn't know it. The writing is high quality, and the ending of the first section is spectacular. Howey builds a brilliant post-apocalyptic world with all of the known world living underground as a giant 'seed bank' ready to re-populate the Earth someday.<br /><br />Queue the nit-picking.<br /><br />Servers, generators, electricity, but no fricking lift in a 138-level underground metropolis? Seriously? As an aside, the porters with muscular legs charging up and down the worn metal steps reminded me of Ted Chiang's short story The Tower of Babylon. Apparently the lack of a lift is patched up as a population-control measure in the prequel First Shift - Legacy, which I just found out about and will go read next.<br /><br />Along the same lines, the lens-cleaning seems a little contrived. A technologically advanced society with engineers and mechanics is going to realise pretty quickly that the lenses could be cleaned with wipers, not sacrificial humans. I get that it is ritualised punishment to keep control of the population, but it seems like just kicking them out the airlock would do the same job.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />I thought poisoning the mayor was a pretty cheap trick. It seems unlikely that Bernard, evil head of IT, would play his hand so obviously when he knows that one misstep can easily destroy the silo. I also had trouble swallowing both Juliette's lackadaisical approach to investigating the mayor's assassination, and the public's acceptance of this approach by their new sheriff. Sure, maybe Julietterecognised Bernard had the upper hand, but the mayor was well liked by the public - why weren't they clamouring for justice?<br /><br />Overall I liked Juliette as a character, the super-smart MacGyver of the silo, but could have done without the Romeo and Juliette references. Her foil, Lukas, starts out as a mysterious and intelligent stranger, and while I liked that he didn't turn out to be the perfect long-distance-cross-silo boyfriend, it was also pretty hard not to get sick of his point of view. It didn't help that Bernard's complete trust in Lukas was implausible. Why would Bernard give every tightly-held secret to somebody who publicly organised a petition for Juliette's release?<br /><br />And speaking of IT, what the hell are the servers for exactly? Perhaps this will be revealed later. My immediate thought was that if they are for storing long-term human history, they should be on tape rather than spinning disk. But not enough has been revealed about the servers: maybe they have much more reliable online storage in this version of the future. Presumably some of the servers run silo equipment, although this seemed to be largely the domain of Mechanical, and there are apparently dozens of racks. Do the IT flunkies know what the servers are for?<br /><br />But that's enough complaining, it really is a great book, and I couldn't put it down, especially during Juliette's underwater adventure.<br /><br />4.5 stars.

B005COO1X6|5.0|My main reason for purchasing my kindle was to put Stephen Kings mamouth 1200 page books on a 9oz reading device.. I have 2 full shelfs of his heavy books..,All of his new books will go on my kindle., which is the only way to go. This book for Stephen King was another master piece... simply awsome, as always...
B0093FNZT6|1.0|I can't say I even finished this book,. I am fairly scientific in my thinking but i can also be spiritual in my own way and thought this book would give me a scientific view on 'God' it it quickly got airy fairy with the describing of the womb and being born into consciousness etc. not my cup of tea sorry.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|My sister watches the series and this is what she wanted for Christmas.  It was a win because I didn't know what to get her.
B00A31UXLW|2.0|A tail which is over the top and lacks any credibility. I do not recommend this book to anyone, even people who have vivid imaginations.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The only thing that I didn't like is that you have to go through the Dark Knight movie to get to the Dark Knight extras.
B0036OS3LA|4.0|These are cute! Unfortunately didn't fit...for me usually I can wear 5 or 5 1/2. They were too tight at the upper/middle part...where my foot couldn't enter at all.
B00288KNJU|5.0|I thought this movie was cute, the story was great and it was a great illustration to the book.  My husband thought it was scary.
0307474259|5.0|This book has quite literally changed my life. Gary Taubes solidifies beyond a doubt, with facts and hard science, how we are meant to eat from a biological perspective. Not a fad diet, in fact he leaves it pretty much up to you to figure out a meal plan with just good basic guidelines. I have been eating this way for four months now and my weight is rapidly correcting. (35 lbs) My blood work is normal, my blood pressure is normal, and I have never felt better. Bottom line.  Eat the way we were meant to eat.
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|This is the worst app I've used!!!!!  I would pick fiction and then try to pick my section such as mysteries and it would give me children's books.  Tried a different book type and it gave me same thing.  Don't bother with this one!!!<br />Only gave it a star because review wouldn't go through without it.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I mean, what else can I say? The plot is not great. It is not written very well. It reads like a 5th grader who just got hold of a thesaurus wrote it. Heck, the sex scenes weren't even that hot!<br />I should have HATED these books. They are worse than Twilight, they really are.<br />But... I don't know. Something in them grabbed me. Probably the notion of 'fixing' Christian or some such nonsense. And I hate to admit it, but with all these bad attributes, this book was still my guilty pleasure.<br /><br />If you get it, just don't expect it to be good literature or anything. *rolls eyes at self
B009VB97EY|1.0|Girls night in dinner-One of the gals chose this movie which I found to be vulgar, sans plot, with every 3d word an expletive. Of course I was clueless that this was about a young man who wants to learn the \\"fine art\\" of the male stripper. Whatever happened to tinkering with cars for a hobby? Now I am 50 y.o educated foreign fil loving woman so clearly this film was not marketed to me; even so, as a healthy 21 yr old my girl friends and I sought out films with a plot and decipherable English. Admittedly, I did not watch much of this film-I couldn't see any point-frankly I was disturbed to see vast numbers of young women publicly(I know...it's a movie!)simulating what is and should be private. And No! I don't feel better because this type of public behavior levels the playing field for women since for centuries they have been made a spectacle in the service of men. Crude behavior when accepted en masse by a society is never an achievement to be celebrated, but don't we already know that? I agree with the Washington Post reviewer Suzy Parker who watched this film with her 80 y.o. Mom, when she indicated that after this film a bath is in order.

B0028MBKVG|4.0|The author did quite a good job of building up background information, leading up to the final confronation between scientific and natural methods.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My sister and brother-in-law mentioned how much they enjoyed watching this show, so I began watching it, on Amazon, after getting Amazon prime.  This show has clever writing, interesting characters, and intriguing story lines.  And the way they dress is cool, too.  I'm an actor and was in &#34;Winter's Tale&#34;, a period piece movie coming out in 2014, and this is how we dressed in that movie.  Sophie McShera, who plays Daisy, is pretty and so are the other daughters.  It is Sophie, though, I am fond of.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The acting and storylines are top notch jessica lang is phenomenal and the effects and make- up are grade A
B00770KR7W|5.0|I would like to start this by saying this figure came within 2 days of ordering it so, definitely a plus for fast delivery.<br /><br />The unexplained new look for Halo 4's Master Chief is overall an improvement to his original design. McFarlane was able to capture this new look beautifully on their figure. Not only is the detail great, but the pose-ability is amazing, the assault rifle fits snug in his hands, and the figure is very sturdy.<br /><br />My one real complaint is the stiffness in the joints, but this is small sense I use this figure for display which looks great with my other Halo figures. Plus, the stiffness pretty much ensures that once you get him into a pose you like, he will stay in that pose, so my complaint is also a plus.<br /><br />Over all, a great figure. I'd recommend this to any Halo fan.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I so wish this was a series! So good I read it in a day. I couldn't put it down.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Great way to start each day for 24 days before Christmas. Kids enjoy the unique characters and pieces, which are nice additions to other sets.  They are a bit expensive but the looks on the faces of my grandchildren make it worth it.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|Qualité 5+ mais seulement 3+ pour le nombre d'épisodes de la saison1.<br />Série très intéréssante par la qualité d'interprétation des personages et même si le rhytme est relativement lent une tension est toujours présente mais franchement c'est beaucoup trop court pour une série ou il faut attendre 1 an pour découvrir laa seconde saison.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Magnifique 3d et film indémodable, un grand classique du cinéma d'animation avec des personages très attachants, et mlgré mes 54 ans j'adore !!!
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I bought this watch on Dec.17, 2011 and it stopped working Jan. 15, 2013. This was heartbreaking because I really liked the watch but the warranty is only for a year and Garmin will charge me $110 to replace the battery. I looked on numerous forums about this particular watch and all complain about the battery.  If you are ok with knowing that this watch will only last you a year, then do buy it (since Garmin will repair it free within the first year). Just understand that the watch will stop working without warning and it could be during your first marathon, leaving you with all sorts of frustration.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy playing these games. It has variety and is challenging. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys playing games.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Warning: This review hints at key plot points.<br /><br />The main characters in this book are impossible to like. Both are whiney and self-absorbed and at times far too stereotypic - the clueless midwestern husband, the bitchy NYC wife). As a result it's hard to 'root for' either one of them. The story line and the wife's revenge gets so convoluted that I almost gave up reading with a third of the book to go. Finally, after setting her up as some sort of cold-blooded planner, her downfall is laughable.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I'm thoroughly enjoying this story but, I'm even more happy with the fact that I can read it on multiple device platforms.<br /><br />I've previously read my books on my iPad - which I've been very happy with, but recently purchased an Android phone and wanted to be able to read the book on it too. I was extremely pleased after purchasing this for Kindle, to find that I could then download the book to the Kindle app for both devices without having to resort to 3rd party software to make it so.  I won't be buying my future Ebooks from Apple anymore.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was a quick read and was very well written.  I would have liked a little more information on the near death experience and less on how the family was handling the experience.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This is defiantly like his 50 shades of gray. It is slow moving and not very riveting. I would not rush to buy this work.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The performance of these actors is amazing.  The story keeps you wanting to know more about the family and those involved.  All the while getting a background of the history of the time.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is definitely a must have It is riveting , exciting, you will not put it down till you are finished.
B003CH9PTU|4.0|My husband and I are about to watch the last two episodes of season 1 so I can't rate in its entirety just yet but we have enjoyed this show. The acting is great by almost every character. I would say that it is very dark and you might say depressing to watch. But we'll be ordering season 2 once we're done and I would say we're hooked!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is another book that you will not put down till you finish the entire trillogy. I hope the author writes more of these kinds of books as they are an excellent escape from the realities of the day
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The best love story I have ever read. This book will be read again. Thank you E.L. James outstanding job.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is great for accessing your home machine! The ability to use your Google account instead having to deal with IP addresses is priceless.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|So far so good. Just started reading it, judging from the last one it should be great.  I love Ayra
0345536886|4.0|I just finished reading &#34;The Litigators&#34;,  held my interest from begining to end. It was funny, sad, crazy and informative. It gave me an insight inside of class action suits. Grishman did an outstanding job with this one.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Awesome, action packed, so  many different stories, such hard core characteristics--one of my favorites dies however.  She comes back as a wraith though.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm not usually a big Nicholas Sparks fan because while I like his movies I can always guess the ending and don't really want to invest the time it takes to read a book of his. However, this one is full of drama and kept me guessing.
B0035JRUZQ|1.0|This is not at all what was ordered. The DVD cover is correct but the content is an animated movie. Totally disappointed.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I always loved the story and have owned the Broadway soundtrack for years.  I convinced my sister (who does not care for musicals or operas) to come see it with me.  I caught her sniffling with her eyes glued to the screen.  She loved it.  You will too!
B002ZG97E2|5.0|It is great movie! It is also funny movie...this is good for children and adults. This is very great product!
030758836X|2.0|This book leaves me speechless-and not for a good reason.<br /><br />I read a bunch of reviews that said that this book was a thrilling page-turner. And don't get me wrong, the first half of the book is great. The author paints a picture of a sweet and loving wife (through her journal entries) and allows your mind to go CRAZY trying to figure out if and how the husband killed her (he seems like a downright jerk who has suspicious actions after she disappears).<br /><br />And then the book does a complete 180. I almost don't have the energy to explain, because it became such an unimaginable waste of time. I kept waiting for there to be this magnificent twist at the end, to make the last half of the book make sense. But it never came. I was reading the book alone at home and I think I literally said out loud, \\"Oh, what the hell?!\\" when I read the last sentence.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. It made me want to break my kindle.<br /><br />Almost.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|it is awesome I lllloooovvvveeee it.you have to get it it is a great demo it has different awesome worlds each for a different name
B001DCQIAK|5.0|A truly powerful and invigorating experience listening to these recordings. Karajan has created a veil of divinity and emotional connection to all those are caught under his spell.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It's ok, but you run out of coins pretty quick, but of course - you are free to buy as many as you want.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|This is a very bold and electric recording of Bruckner. Karajan mastered his symphonies to a breathtaking level. This is another must buy Karajan recording
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I like that it also had a little suspense in it. Great way to end the book. Couldn't put it down.
B004G7FFF8|5.0|Buy it... Just buy it. It is excellent!!! Liszt is so well known but there is a lot of his piano scores that have gone unnoticed but not to Leslie Howard; who spent a vast amount of time to perfect these brilliant recordings. It lasts over 5 and a half days of music all at once... Come on you've got a few thousand hours don't you?
B0068RHGJM|5.0|I am an avid fan of Nightwish, having bought every album, and am very happy with their newest release. This band just gets better and better! Imaginaerum continues their trend of offering an eclectic mix of songs, from dark, pounding rhythms to sweetly beautiful operatic pieces to Irish-Celtic lilts and even a smoky, nightclubish-styled track. It's hard to pick a favorite track, but for me Ghost River does capture that marvelous combination of sounds and interest that makes Nightwish so interesting. It seems that Marco Hietala is singing more often which is great - his growling vocals are a nice juxtaposition to Anette Olzon's. I look forward to the next album, even with a new female lead coming on board.
B0000041LO|5.0|Very refined recordings of Haydn's piano trios. Full of life and majesty. The beaux trio have done splendid job of communicating Haydn's genius.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I would recommend this to all of my friends. Most of whom i know will like the book as well
B007IQWQ88|5.0|I went ballistic when this was delivered. It is beyond perfect! My words are useless to describe how awesome this is until you buy it yourself. It's a little expensive but so worth it. The recordings are sublime and the box and the inside information is excellent. A book with all the recordings in the box and 4 replica recording sheets. A must buy of the master Herbert von Karajan!
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|This was a free ebook on Kindle. You get what you pay for. The writng was not very creative and I thought that the author was not really into writing this book. It felt like a form mystery book and the author just filled in the blanks. Nancy Drew book are better written and entertaining than Killer Cupcakes. I gave 2 stars because I liked the idea of a bunch of grandma's solving crime.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Purchased as Christmas gift for my wife.  Sound when on Speaker gets a little distorted because of sealed tight case.  This was expected though as the case is waterproof.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I downloaded the sample on my kindle with about 3 other books--wasn't really into reading about witches & vampires but this story has so much intrigue and keeps your attention, I had to buy the book and keep reading. This is well written-I've read all three books of Hunger Games and the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo.....this series is right up there on the charts with those books and for a &#34;new writer&#34;  Deborah Harkness has what it takes to keep the story alive!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Was supposed to be sleeping a couple hours ago but the author constantly keeps you pulled into the story. Can't wait to read the next one.
B008CYDD7I|1.0|Movie is a trite attempt at science fiction.  I would not recomend movie to any human being.  Fourtys movies are  more enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not a reader but I loved this book. It made me keep reading and now I know what people have been raging about.
B004SIP73U|4.0|Enjoyed movie because of the theme and great job of acting.  I was raised Catholic and related to content.  Nuns are sadists.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this program.  I look forward to watching it again as soon as I finish watching each episode.  I hope it doesn't end.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I finished this in a day. Couldn't stop reading. Truly incredible writing that brought me to tears at some points. This is an epic tale of star-crossed lovers, but not the typical Shakespearean model. I laughed, cried, and questioned the meaning of life. Thank you, John Green. Thank you.
1250027624|5.0|Bought this for a Christmas gift and it was a great reference used before third season opened this past week.  I liked I liked it so much so that I plan to order one for myself!
B000P0J09M|5.0|Its a Movie that u have to have spgettie and meatballs with ............Awesome Movie<br />I would say this movie is a Classic In every witch way ....
B008RYN44U|5.0|Sonic mastery!<br /><br />Get this and some good headphones, close you eyes and ascend to heaven.<br /><br />Great songs and amazing production.  Thanks No Doubt, what a great album to come back with!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I've recommended this book to so many of my friends... I recommend you get past the contract because from there forward come's the real Grey And why he is the way he is.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is a great movie. It was shipped on time and the product was as described.  I would do buisness here again.
B0054S6N04|5.0|Reading the title, I would never have imagined this book to be so great! There was never a doll moment.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|This is a great movie. It was shipped on time and the product was as described.  I would do buisness here again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|If you've ever read the Hunger Games or if you've ever seen the movie, you'll love the second and third book that follow.  They get even better with every book.
6305428042|5.0|This is a great movie. It was shipped on time and the product was as described.  I would do buisness here again.
1442359315|5.0|Very much enjoyed the book and the tape.  Since Dr. Alexander is from my area, it was more than a treat.  Have loaned to friends.
0765325950|5.0|I'm 3 chapters in and so far its hard to put down!  im very much excited for the rest of it and ready to go home and start reading!  i'm sure anyone one who has read the first 13 books is bound to want this conclusion and if you haven't read any of the first i recommend starting with the first one (the eye of the world by Robert Jordan) but for the review, its awesome and i hope others enjoy it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I adored this novel.  It had twists and unexpected turns that kept me reading and wishing for more.  I am over 40 and I related to 17 yr old Sky with ease.  I can't wait to read Coleen Hoover's other novels.
0062209493|5.0|The set came on time and was a great gift for my husband. He uses it when he drives to and from work.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|like the movie  worth the watch really can''t say much more it's a good movie person sent it very quick;y
0375869026|4.0|We need more of this type of books for our younger generation--so there is more sensitivity to others!<br />I remember when I first learned that &#34;if you had black skin--you had to travel 80 miles a day to go to school!&#34;<br />Nothing was said in the 50's about what you had to endure if you were different because your skin was not white!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card tells the disturbing story of earths salvation, a young boy named ender.  Ender must learn all that is necessary to become the greatest general of all time in order to save earth from a war with an alien race.  Orson Scott Card masterfully crafts a politically unstable world of the not to distant future held together by fear of another alien attack.  Orson Scott Card also puts you in the mind of a genius child put under extenuating stress and how he must cope.  The situation of ender Wiggins will have you questioning morals, philosophy, and how much a child's mind can endure even if he is a genius.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|I agree with many of the other reviewers; there was enough material here for an interesting article.  The examples of habits not only began to wear thin, several of them stretched the theory and the definition ofma habit beyond credibility.  What started as an interesting idea about something that could be applied to everyday life turned into an annoying read.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I don't like being required to write these with a certain amount of words.  That  is what makes me not even give a review. It keeps saying there is a problem with my review! ARGH!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These are super cute and easy to use. I really enjoyed the gems that came with it. I would definately recommened getting the Disney Princess Glitter Castle to go with it. The gems enhance the castle perfectly.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|I don't like being required to write these with a certain amount of words.  That  is what makes me not even give a review. It keeps saying there is a problem with my review! ARGH!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really liked this book even with its &#34;kinky fu_ _ery&#34;.  The characters were well developed and the more you learn about Christian's early years, the more empathy you have for him- can understand more of his need for control and how his &#34;dom&#34; character developed.  I didn't care for what he did at the end of the book, but it set the tone for the next book.  My sister said every married woman should read this book and I would agree.  Some friends couldn't tolerate the &#34;playroom&#34; activities, so I would say that this book is not appropriate for teen age girls.  After reading book 1, I had to get the next and I enjoyed that one more.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I don't like being required to write these with a certain amount of words.  That  is what makes me not even give a review. It keeps saying there is a problem with my review! ARGH!
0425263908|5.0|I loved the fist two books in this series. I've even already per-ordered the third one and can't wait till May when it comes out.
0765325950|5.0|I think people should just spend the money on the hardback copy of the book and enjoy it.  You will.
0345803485|5.0|Love this book, its sexy, daring and so much fun. cant wait to finish and read the next one. love this story
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book was a really wonderful &#34;feel good&#34; read that also reconnected me to my connection with God. I just loved it!!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie to anyone!! It is awesome!! A good storyline, strong performances from both main and supporting cast and some superb singing!!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Install and use of the app works well. So far, no hangs or glitches. Only issue was figuring out how to delete downloaded content when I was done with it. Found a way to do it is home, app, Adobe Reader, select documents then &#34;manage&#34;. Select documents you want to delete and then the trash symbol.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I bought this game for my Kindle Fire HD and I enjoy playing it.  However sometimes the pipes do not connect on the first try. It has some easy games and some fairly hard ones so it is very entertaining.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins has once again outdone herself! I couldn't put this book down! I absolutely loved it and can't wait to start Mockingjay!
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is a very fun game but the game does not last very long. It is however, great for the price. Kids and adults can enjoy this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever downloaded!  I am addicted to his game.  It is really fun and sometimes funny!
B003V6L94Q|5.0|What's to say...if you love Zac Brown Band then you'll Love this CD.  It has a lot of selections that will be familiar to you.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The lighting thief is a good book and an adventurous book for middle aged kids overall the lighting thief is a very good book and its worthy of five stars
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is a great movie for all young and old. We enjoy it often, great for the family night movie!!
B007BVT5N4|5.0|It was an amazing book!  It was really awesome to know Justin's side of the story. I felt like I was with him throughout his whole journey! Love u Justin! From, Mrs.Bieber
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A great read!  After had several similar NDEs.  I understand, that from this Neurosurgeon's view that I'm not the only one that has gone through that experience, and never spoken to anyone about it!  A great read for anyone that has similar experiences, and would highly recommend this book!  However, do not believe all the naysayers that have written books rebutting this book!!!!  Faith and ones belief, have no bearing on your relationship with God, and that is a personal relationship!!  After my experiences, I know what Dr. Eben states is fact.  The Creator (God) is all about unconditional love, period!!  One day everyone will find out if the door to Heaven is open, or closed to them.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Allthough I am overweight and exercising little, this book was a revelation in many aspects and so well written and entertaining.  I decided to buy a pair of five fingers and started walking every day, plan to start  running in a few weeks.<br /><br />I found myself going back to chapters of the book (which I don´t normally do after done with a book) and enjoying even more the second time<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for athletes, runners and also &#34;couch potatoes&#34; like me that could become motivated in a way they would not believe.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Im still wondering what the noise is about this book. I read a lot of urban contemperary and this is pg-13 compared to that. Good love story I guess?
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Wow! what a voice, just wonderful but I would still like her to record a Christmas album, I can't wait!!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is pretty simple but it is so fun.  I have many other games installed on my Android device but I play this one the most.  It is just plain fun.
B007THA4FI|3.0|A good casual read.  A bit heavy on liberal leaning politics for my personal taste.  Slow start, better toward the end.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I loved this game.  This type of game where you have to solve problems to advance is my favorite type of game.  The Lost City was very well executed and I hope to find sequels to play.
B00633W614|5.0|A page turner that is difficult to put down.  Looking forward to the third book.  Hoping for happiness of the main characters.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|Game was too short, should have been longer. Graphics were beautiful, voice over should have been better. Overall a good game, but not great.
1421550644|5.0|I like this book so much. The quality is just as i expcected, with 2 books and 1 poster. This Box set is so great for anyone who's GHIBLI's fan.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The book starts off slowly, leaving much to wonder and desire by the reader. However, the books unfolds continually, always looping the reader in with a few more details. The story and competition between the two main characters is extremely well written and the additional characters are also integral to the plot. If you like magic, fantasy, and a complex interplay between characters, this book is for you. I literally couldn't put it down for the last 150-200+ pages because I HAD to know the ending. Happy reading!
B0098460O4|5.0|After listening to this phenomenal duo preform on BGT (many, many times) I was hooked. They are the MOST amazing singers I've ever heard, in this genre. I believe Jonathan's voice has a better quality than Pavarotti's. Charlotte also has an amazing voice and range and the combination of the two are outstanding. After watching the BGT audition and listening to the comments of good old Simon Cowell I gained a huge amount of respect for Jonathan for NOT &#34;dumping&#34; Charlotte. The songs on this C.D. are great. Obviously there is a difference in the Live performance and this C.D. but I am very happy with the entire C.D. I wish these two the absolute BEST...... Thank You
B008K8X0IS|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo5WDFDIVGL3R9]]Let me just say that the series itself, without question, is totally worth getting.  Whether to get the Collector's or just the Blu-ray Edition is entirely up to you.  For me, getting the Collector's Edition was worth it because I did not previously own it and because of the price.  At the time when I bought it, it was on sale for $39.99!  Definitely worth it for that price!  A breakdown of what it all comes with:<br /><br />-A Collectible Box<br />-Game of Thrones Season One Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy<br />-Bonus Features (same as the stand-alone Blu-Ray Edition)<br />  Making of<br />  15 Character profile clips<br />  Creating the Dothraki language<br />  Inside the Night's Watch<br />  From Book to Screen<br />  Creating the Show Open<br />  7 Audio Commentaries Guide to Westeros<br /><br />  Blu-ray Exclusive Features-<br />  Complete Guide to Westeros<br />  In-Episode Guide<br />  Anatomy of an Episode<br />  Hidden Dragon Eggs<br />-Bonus Episode One from Season Two<br />-Paperweight Dragon Egg<br /><br />So I would say that if you are into Collector's Editions of things for the box casing/artwork or the physical items related to the show/movie that it comes with it, I would say it's probably worth paying around $50-60 for.  So for me it was obviously a no brainer (payed just $40).  If you buy Collector's Edition for the extra video content, than surely it is NOT worth it.  The only extra content you get in the Collector's Edition is the bonus episode of Season Two.  Other than that, the bonus features are all the same as the stand alone Blu-Ray Edition.  This is primarily a rating for the product itself, but the show itself is beyond amazing!  I absolutely love this show, it has quickly become one of my favorites of all time.<br /><br />To get a little more in depth, search thekingkhan13 to find my review with better video quality.  Hope this was helpful.  -Thanks
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good game for a casual player. good graphics and a good story line. not free but worth the money. this is one of my choice games
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|This is a very cute game about guiding a mouse to its cheese in a maze. You start from the cheese and end at the top (that confused me to begin with, but I can totally see why it works better than starting at the top). The graphics are great, and the music and sound effects fit in, but the one thing that does annoy me a bit is the squeak squeak squeak squeaking the mouse does.<br /><br />It's overall a really well made game that I would recommend to anyone. A great time waster. The levels get pretty hard by the 6th one, so give it a chance if you think it's a little too easy to begin with. And it has a nice zoom feature too, so you think it's just a tad too small, you can use pinch to zoom.<br /><br />FYI: If your phone usually has problems with playing video in games, I would skip this one. As it seems this is using some things that do trigger the freezes and jittery video.
B00797MB0O|3.0|...and she exits as a cocktailed, attractive, shallow person.  The end.<br /><br />No, actually, there are some funny scenes in the middle, as well as some that were painful to watch.  There is also the hint of an event from the past...did said event traumatize her, or was she always the way she is?  We can't really tell.<br /><br />Charlie Theron does a good job as always, and there are some moments that get you to feel something, but the story could have been more well-developed.
098478280X|5.0|Step by step guide to interview. Arrived on time.<br />For anyone who is preparing for an interview, a must have.<br />Only the downside is that it relates to application content only. Should have some problems on systems too.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Absolutely could not put it down..great writer., John Grisham has a knack for keeping you guessing  through the entire book.  i WOULD RECOMMEND THE RACKETER TO ANYONE.
1781006849|1.0|The general content of this book is solid, but the text is full of spelling and grammatical errors. For example, on the author page, the word \\"Captain\\" is spelled \\"Captian\\". These errors should have been caught by the publisher and until and effort is made to correct the 100+ grammatical and spelling errors I found in this book it is not worth the $100 plus.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The storyline was slightly predictable but the music throughout the movie was great. I love how they blended two songs together during performances
075669812X|1.0|We ordered this book and it came with a Lego figure. However, it was missing some of the pieces. How can we get the missing pieces?
B008CPZNL6|5.0|The latest version of the Flipboard app is simply breathtaking as well as functional. One of my favorite apps. Very beautiful to look at and interact with.
B005IQZB14|4.0|A different kind of storyline.  Would want to read another book by the author.  Love a true story, written by a woman.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I love this app because when I don't have my ipod I can still text on my kindle but some how it keeps crashing and its hard to text without crashing. But really its a good app in general.
B001NLKWLW|2.0|First of all, I am not a fan of the writing style that jumps between periods of time.  It was especially confusing, as this book has so many generational characters.  Second, the story line kept getting weaker as the plot unfolded. Last, the author has writing talent, but this book was a bridge too far to have believability.  Sorry, I don't recommend it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|The game is very well done and fun to play. However, it doesn't give you enough opportunities to win more coins so you can keep playing. You do get a new coin every 30 seconds while the game is on but who has time to wait 30 seconds before playing the next move? The only other way to get more (41) coins is to let it regenerate for 4 hours.  So you can play a few minutes and then have to put it aside for half a day. What's the point of that?<br /><br />Of course you can buy more coins but that can get very expensive very fast. I don't think an app game should operate like a gambling casino where the odds are so obviously stacked agsinst you.<br /><br /> It is also unclear what the rules are... what the various coins do... what &quot;regen plus 1&quot; means
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|enjoyed this free app quite a bit (4 out of 5) but then we downloaded the upgrade...it's got tons of ads. very annoying. I don't recommend the upgrade/deluxe version; it's a dud.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|\\"The time has come to select a courageous young man and woman<br />to participate in this year's Hunger Games\\"~Effie Trinket<br />\\"Let the 74th Annual Hunger Games Begin!\\"~Caesar Flickerman<br /><br />The Hunger Games Trilogy takes place in post-apocalyptic North America, now known as Panem. The government requires one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen from each of the twelve districts to act as \\"tributes\\" in the annual Hunger Games (a televised fight to the death where the lone victor becomes rich).<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen becomes District 12's female tribute and has to fight to survive not just for herself, but also for her family. Peeta Mellark is the male tribute from District 12 and he has a few secrets he's never told Katniss. Haymitch Abernathy, District 12's only victor who spends his life at the bottom of a bottle, is Katniss and Peeta's mentor and their lifeline. Haymitch, along with Effie the escort, Cinna and Portia (the stylists) help Katniss and Peeta make a lasting impression on the potential sponsors who could very well save their lives in the arena. At home, while Katniss and Peeta are in the Capitol and the Arena, Katniss' friend Gale helps her mother and little sister, Prim(rose) as they are forced to watch the Games on TV.<br /><br />The Tributes from each of the 12 Districts (24 kids) are taken to the luxurious Capitol where they are paraded around, interviewed, and trained for the nation-wide televised fight to the death. Getting sponsors and survival are the only things that can save the main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, if she wishes to survive and continue to feed and protect her family. Dying is not an option for her.<br /><br />Movie<br /><br />Some people didn't like the movie. When I first saw it, I loved it. However, as I've watched it several more times, I've become increasingly dissatisfied. Not because of what they cut out (which was a lot, including certain things I think needed to be included) but with how the director, Gary Ross, filmed the movie. He used a handheld camera to show \\"subjectivity\\" because he felt if he used normal filming techniques with stable wide-angle lenses, movie audiences would become like  the flamboyant and ignorant citizens of \\"the Capitol\\" watching The Hunger Games, instead of understanding fans of Suzanne Collins' visceral book. I understand his thinking, but I still wish the screen didn't shake every two seconds making some people experience vertigo rather than watching the movie.<br /><br />Other Notes<br /><br />I highly recommend this trilogy, I read all three books in 9 hours and stayed up until 2 in the morning reading it last Thanksgiving, and it certainly made me grateful that I didn't live in Panem. I suggest everyone stops reading this and buy The Hunger Games already! Then, when you're done with the Trilogy (however long that takes you), I'd also check out [[ASIN:B004CFA9RS Divergent]] and [[ASIN:B00AJEVS6W Insurgent]] by Veronica Roth.<br /><br />To read more of my book reviews, please go to [...]d the movie.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Child does it again, Reacher struts his stuff while coming to the rescue. Mental gymnastics and kick some bad guy butt are Reacher trademarks.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Wow!  Didn't agree with all of her views, but LOVED the way she presents them with every bit of her humanity and \\"strident feminism\\" hanging out for all to see.  I laughed so many times out loud that my husband started asking me to read in another room!  I just bought her next book, \\"Moranthology\\" and can't wait to start reading it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good read. Hard to put down. Fast paced, interesting characters. Would recommend to any one with an interest in science fiction.
0446554995|5.0|Agent Pendergast is as quirky and intriguing as ever. It is a tight plot and a quick read. I always hate for it to be over, because it's such a long wait until and if there is a next one.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Loved this movie. Although there was a lot of graphic violence, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it is ok I think it could use more features but it is ok. just work harder on it k
B00A8SPNYW|2.0|Suspicious of the 5 star reviews from users with no other review history, I waited to see what else was posted throughout the day.  I tried this on an Asus Prime tablet and the Samsung Galaxy III phone.  Cute graphics aren't enough reason to keep this installed and right now that's the only positive I can give it for now.<br /><br />Poor development will keep people from enjoying this for long, especially children- contrary to what other have said.  The reason I say that is because if you make an error in the layout there isn't a restart button.  Another reviewer mentioned this also.  You have to go all the way out to the main menu and reselect the level and start again.  This is also true when the mouse catches you - completely back out and reselect the level to replay.  Not only would it be nice to have a restart button that other level games offer but it would also be nice if it let you correct your path if you make an error.  The lag if you fail the level also needs to be addressed.  Makes me wonder if they had anyone test this besides in-house staff.<br /><br />Graphics alone would get it a 5 but technical development significantly reduces its rating.  Fix these problems then I would upgrade my rating but until then parents can find other things to better occupy their child's time.
B00633W614|4.0|I have always enjoyed Archer\\"s books going back to Kane and Abel. This series is fast pace and a great read. I can't tell you how frustrated I am that I have to wait May to continue....uugghhh
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a roller coaster joy ride with the characters from the first book. I loved the suspense from the quarter quell to the lead in of book three. Fun reading.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Hd to get thisntonshow grandchildren. Story has so much meaning and they will love it. Want to watch it together with them
B007N85POS|4.0|My neice enjoys playing this game so I am glad I could download the game for her to play all the time.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Highly recommend for all Led Zeppelin fans! Jason Bonham fills in his father's shoes like no one else could ever do.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game of Solitaire that I have played for years at home. Now I can play is on my Kindle.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|This book is life changing, probably the best book I have read on wealth since &#34;The richest man in Babylon&#34;.<br />The book explains the type of person who naturally becomes rich because of his way of thinking, nothing to do with income,<br />education or inheritance.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I was really impressed by this game. You certainly get your 99 cents' worth with this easy-to-learn traipse though a magical land. I had hours and hours of fun--much more than I expected. The graphics are super and the game play is immersive. If you like inventory-type games and exploring, this is the game for you. It's a great way to take a break and have some fun without hurting your brain too much. A nice shift of gears, as it were. The map feature makes it easy to retrace your steps, and to see where you are. I'll be checking out this company's other titles!
B0086700CM|2.0|I loved this game until when I was scrolling through the characters and had about 25,000 for my score, which I was saving up to buy this one character, but when I was scrolling through them, it clicked on another character and bought it which I didn't want!!!!! So now I have like no coins left and am very angry!!!!!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is a really cool game. And, for 99 cents, you cannot go wrong. I like the twist on the usual inventory game; you have to find all of the parts of an object before you can use it. And you can't find them all at once. You have to play along with the game ;-) The hint button is great for when you're sure you've poked at and tapped on everything in sight and you're just plain stuck. The Steampunk-type vibe is a nifty theme for a change. I've already gotten Snark Busters 2.<br /><br />Here's a little tip: if you can see an object near the edge of the screen but it just refuses to go into the inventory, go to the menu and change the aspect ratio. The margin is moved and you can pick up the item piece. I'm looking forward to replaying it.<br /><br />Also, it's a bit buggy and takes you back to the home screen once in a while (usually while going through the mirror) but it doesn't affect the game play. Just know that it could happen and don't freak out. Your game is saved and waiting for you.
0765325950|5.0|The last book of the series does not disappoint. The entire book is a very satisfying and engaging read. I personally have read all other books in the series on the kindle, but I have absolutely no complaint about it not being an eBook release until later. Besides, the media a story is published on does not change the story itself, which is what these reviews are supposed to be about. Any true fan of literature would not hesitate to scoop up a book in any way it is presented to the reader if they truly love its story. The book is amazing, buy it, read it, enjoy it.
076790592X|5.0|This is a profound book.It sounds authentic.It flows from the heart of the author.It classically illustrates the salutary tradition of teacher-student relationship.Through their medium,the author raises critical issues concerning life.Deeply touching,it has a transformative effect.It is more in the nature of a reminder of simple truth and plain values.It shows that hedonism is not the end of human life.Theare is more to it than relentless pursuit of wealth.I have always felt that world and mankind have to evolve to realize,first hand,the poverty and sheer emptiness of materialism.This book is sure to help individuals in this evolutionary process.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|One of the best game apps so far. Entire family enjoys this one, first day of play, so far awesome.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great and I am looking forward to reading the second book I have read it over and over and it is still good
B005OT2YVA|2.0|Excellent CGI, awesome special effects, great machinery and sci-fi feel. Awesome robot-to-robot combat. Nice historical footage work.<br /><br />Overall, terrible movie, due to inconsistencies, deus ex machina, plot holes all over the place, random things happening that have nothing to do with anything. This is really a \\"B\\" movie, like those B-movies that Mystery Science Theater 3000 rips on.<br /><br />The plot is so thin an ant fart would rip it to shreds. Unfortunately, no ants farted at any point while I was watching two and a half hours of my life wander away from me in confusion.<br /><br />Most entertaining human character: Jerry, the weird Asian.<br />Most entertaining robot: The little ones that you just wanna have as your own pet.<br /><br />This movie uses the first hour to create an absolutely hopeless scenario that could have been a good set up for an awesome movie. I actually wondered if the Autobots could really save the day.<br /><br />Instead, the movie used the last hour to rip off The Avengers. A portal ripping open the sky to another dimension to allow access to an alien homeworld? Large, whale-like ships floating around that are carriers for smaller craft?<br /><br />If you liked the first film, don't watch this one. Just watch the Avengers again, or wait for Pacific Rim. Sorry Autobots.<br /><br />If you want to just see things blow up, and watch robots fight each other, but without any other traditional movie elements such as reason, logic, acting, AND you watched all the videos on Youtube of rednecks and scientists and kids in their backyard blowing things up, and saw all the robots from MIT punching each other, then watch the film: Just don't tell anyone.
B00A757EFW|1.0|not like the pac man I was used to playing , do not this format al all, don't play anymore
B009K0P10K|4.0|I was very pleased I will recommend to my friends.<br />The pixels quality amazing and it only took a few seconds to load.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|not my kind of game disappointing I have better games to play that I enjoy much more thank-you  anyway  good bye
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Tons of fun and replay value. Looking forward to getting the expansions as well. Also great for playing with family as well as casual games with friends
B0063IH60K|5.0|very good format, I really like this game and I play this one many time, very good game for me
B007VUA7VO|5.0|At first I wasn't sure about this app but, I'm glad I decided to try it out. The best part is is.... it's free!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I really liked this game, but it froze up on mme and I kept losing my bingo's, and get no re;ply from buffalo
0307744434|5.0|This was a beautiful book to read - I couldn't put it down! I look forward to reading more of Erin Morgenstern's works in the future.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|it is interesting to see my friends comments and pictures , I can check on my friends ofter thank-you for you time
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Sparks took a different approach in this book. He gave you a look inside all the characters minds from a psychological aspect. Domestic violence can be a touchy subject to discuss let alone write and he does it perfectly.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Great for the Captain America and lego fans. My son is a big fan of both so I figured this set would be the perfect gift and it was. He plays with his legos all the time and I would bet this is probably his favorite right now. He always seems to be playing with captain america
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I plugged this into my Samsung Ativ Pro and it worked perfectly through the usb 3.0 port. Also, it was the best priced one I could find. Would buy again
B00005QG9I|1.0|Incubus is awesome, but when my package came in the mail it was not a vinyl. It was a used CD with a crack in the cover. This was supposed to be a Chrismas gift so of course I am very upset about this. CD's and vinyl are two totally different things to anyone who didn't know!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|LOVE this series.  Its a little hard to follow at first, but if you read the Appendix on who is with what kingdom, and who killed who, etc... you can follow pretty easily.  I'm hooked.  I bought season 1 of the tv show, but want to finish reading the books first.
B006S039YU|5.0|I love the movie and this was just what I wanted. :) Worth every cent of the price and earned the 5 stars!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a fun, relaxing game. If you do it right, you don't have to spend any money to get those acorns. (=
B004VYYA2K|5.0|My grand daughter loved this gift. It is storage for all of her Barbies and then opens up to become a  flat play area, it even has a runway.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|this is a good read and I enjoyed it.  Not a great literary piece but keeps the reader guessing.  Preston has done better.
1401322786|4.0|It is clear that Albom is in transition. His wonderful skills as a mirror for people has worked best as the interview/writer. He continues to develop as the fiction writer.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love how easy it is  play<br />This game keeps my son and I  both entertained!! If your looking for an easy game that won't get boring for you or your kids then this is the one for you.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Slow moving at first because you have to wait for coins to regenerate. If you keep it open to regenerate faster it kills my kindle battery. Takes over 100 levels before you can play without running out. Level 60 before you can play for more than 5 minutes. Once you get going though it's very fun and addictive.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|I rented this in HD for my new Kindle Fire,  The movie was great and the picture was super on my Kindle Fire!  Would recommend this movie - the younger folks might not appreciate it as much, but us older, more seasoned married people can certainly relate!
B00006LLLN|5.0|One of my new favorites. Hadn't listened much to AKUS in the past, but this album has it all. What a voice; what a band!
B009K0P10K|3.0|Revenge Season 1 was very good but Season 2 is getting complicated with so many characters and everyone is plotting against<br />each other.  It's becoming less real.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|Can't believe I paid 30.00 for this thing.  Very cheap. It doesn't really stand up, just kinda leans on the folded over part. Oh well it was a christmas present for my son.  At least it covers the screen when closed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was my first foray into vince flynn books and the recurring tales of CIA super-assassin Mitch Rapp. I had a hard time putting the book down. Very entertaining and the action doesn't stop. I just wish I had read all the previous Mitch Rapp books first, but i'll go back and read them now.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|This was a request on my brother-in laws Christmas list. The movie was great and owning it is very convientient.
B001BW02B8|5.0|I have all of Maroon 5's MP3 albums and  It Won't Be Soon Before Long is my favorite by far.
B002JG67L4|5.0|Loving it and living large. This was a great buy and I will keep my eyes open for more to come.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I love music and Night Visions by Imagine Dragons is one of my favorite MP3 albums. There is not a song that I don't like on the entire album....Great buy...Great Band!!!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The first half goes quite slowly, then the book picks up and doesn't relent until the final page. I hope book six comes quickly!
B003297I1U|4.0|The 3 year old who received this for Christmas was really impressed.  He loves trucks, and cranes in particular. He picks up all kinds of things with the crane and likes to put a variety of his little people in the cab to drive the truck.  He likes the doors opening and the lights and sound as well as the operating crane, which is huge.  This child is fairly thoughtful and careful, but he only plays with it with adult supervision right now since he has a baby brother who could potentially get into trouble with it. That is fine because his dad loves playing with trucks too. When both little boys get older I think it will be just as interesting and retain its play value. I was told it is made of expanded styrene so it is very light for its size but some parts of it seem just a little bit flimsy. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise it seems to be well made, highly detailed and encourages creative play. I hope the long crane and doors do not snap off before the boys get old enough to really appreciate the fine details.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I gave this novel 5 stars because it was a page turner.  It kept me on my toes the whole way through.  I didn't want it to end.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is a Fast easy read.  Good story line, I enjoyed it very much. I plan on readying many more of John Grishams books!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I kept reading and reading could not let it go, at the end I just wanted more.  looking forward to reading the next one and the next..
B000NQ19QA|5.0|cool book. nice leather / production.  great story -- an agatha classic.  hope there are more in this collection... i'll look
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am so in love with this book! The whole story line is just phenomenal, a breath taking new turn on romance novels:) a must read for all young women...
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app has some super cute ideas for crafts, nails, food,...almost anything!  Found a lot of great things on hear I'm not sure i would've searched for.  Completely addicting!!
B001LF3YQK|5.0|I think this case works really well. Unlike some of the other reviewers, it's been easy to slide the red button and grab a wipe (or two, or three, or four:) with one hand. All types of wipes work well with it. The size wasn't an issue for me - it lives in my diaper bag and I like that it's able to hold a lot of wipes - less chance of me becoming wipes-less in a time of need!
1401323820|5.0|It was very good and did hold my interest.  Good story idea and do hope to get more of them.
B003O86FMW|4.0|this book was pretty amazing because katniss was awesome i was not a big fan of peeta cause i don't exactly like romance stuff but nevertheless the book was great
1401937519|5.0|The tender and amazing journey that Ms. Moorjoni shares has a powerful,simple message.  I am grateful that she was able to write the book of her very personal experience.  It offers comfort and encourages each of us to look within ourselves to find out that we are all indeed connected and we are all capable of fulfilling our lives by just being who we are.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Once again, Shinedown delivers with a terrific mix of rock, power ballads, and just darn good songwriting. Love this album.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I normally am not a fan of crime mystery novels because I find it hard to stay connected to the book. But Lee did a great job of keeping me guessing and wanting more. The only improvement I could see if his dialog can be a little dry at times. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Superb story. Excellently written. Best I've read in a long time. Mr Green, thank you for making this world a little brighter by bringing us Hazel and Agustus.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Love it. It is a very good and fun way to spend  my free time. I have even been able to get my wife to play a little bir lately.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|This download wasn't anything too special at all and thats why i rated it a 1 star.  It didn't freeze or anything just didn't have but more than a week as other downloads were better out there.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|BEST GAME EVER!!!!!! but wish they could get a new version such as la's Vegas version.<br />also need to stop blacking me out
0525423281|4.0|This is darling and SO.MUCH.FUN to read. I couldn't put it down.<br />Lola is one of my favorite characters ever. She is so completely unique I can't help but adore her. And what a great story about finding \\"the one.\\"<br />Looking forward to what Perkins comes out with next.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love this show so much! The 9th doctor is amazing. Rise is gorgeous! I absolutely recommend this show. I am already obsessed. And on the 5th season
B007MDB71O|4.0|I originally rented this movie due to the fact that it didn't do so well at the box office. I have to say that after watching it once I wanted to have it in my collection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is so good I play this app all day long make interesting buildings.<br /><br />  MAKE THE BEST BUILDINGS EVER BEEN SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!
B001P36OY2|5.0|I've always enjoyed Vin Diesel, so I enjoyed this movie.  It's definitely different, so if you don't enjoy sci-fi, don't buy this movie.  It's definitely action-packed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm only ten and frankly this is one of the best books ever. You know besides Harry potter. Definitely reading catching fire right now. The idea of kids fighting to the death while people view it on television is a bit scary but one 've you get over that fact, which you do rather quickly, the book pulls you in and you can't put it down. I took me one day to read this. Literally. Overall breath taking.
1449410243|4.0|If you are a cat person you will appericate the humor. Very funny take on cats and what they really thinking!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A different type of book from King but what a thrilling adventure! I could barely tear myself away to do those pesky things like sleep or work. As always, loved the book! Just a bit sad to see the story end.
0316227706|5.0|Such a great book, you can't help but smile everytime you open it.  Seth Casteel captured dogs just having fun and a unquie setting. The photography is wonderful and you can tell those pups love splashing around in the water.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Awesome ending but it sort of leaves you hanging at the end, but other than that I LOVED it!!!! Just AWESOME!!!!  Review by AtlantaMom3's daughter
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|TIm Burton at his best. Such a sweet story with a lot of heart and you can't but fall in love with Frankenweenie. Must see!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I am a Castle TV fan, so I figured I would try one of the books. I didn't expect it to be as good as it is. I find myself placing the TV characters names in the book rather than what is written. The book is well written and fun to read. I will probably purchase some more of them.
B005KPDAN4|5.0|Awesome series, one of my all time favorites.  Very sad that its over!  This last season was just as good or better than any prior season in my opinion.  The best way to watch is DVD or streaming so you can watch multiple episodes (or the whole season) at once! ;-)
B00280LYIC|4.0|I enjoyed reading this enough to keep reading it half way through the night and buy the next one in the series, The Sea of Monsters.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a great game !! The only issue I have is that I would love to see more houses barns, etc to add to the town..No problems with it closing automatically like some apps...highly recommend.
B004SEUJVO|5.0|This is one of my favorite coming of age films of all time, and I've seen them all (from the great John Hughes' Breakfast Club to Fast Times At Ridgemont High).  Though Adventureland was marketed as a in-your-face comedy,  expect more of a character-driven drama written from the heart.  Unlike most Hollywood films, it feels very real, and at no time did it seem like these were actors playing a part (Kristen Stewart actually shot this film before being cast in Twilight).  Don't expect this to be as ridiculous or as funny as Superbad, though there are some great laughs that make this a very fun and enjoyable movie to watch.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this film to anyone in high school and college who is trying to find their way and figure life out.<br /><br />P.S. Whether you grew up in the '80s or not, this film's soundtrack is filled with great songs that are timeless!  I was so impressed that I got the soundtrack!
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Superb talent for melody for both guitar and vocals. Sounds like Jason Mraz. Lyrics great. My favorite part is his cover of the parting glass at the end of give me love, but I like almost every song.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book is a classic. I like this book because Buck saved John Thornton's life. I would recommend this book to other people who like action/drama books.
B001P06GX4|4.0|This game is about strategy of placing and blocking opponents. It's not very difficult to learn but thinking ahead is key. It isn't fun unless there is a little challenge, and you need all the players for that, otherwise there is so much space to place pieces it isn't that hard. 3 players does okay, but usually only one will go out and the other two can finish all their pieces.
B007FTZDN8|3.0|This app offers a wide variety of lectures. They can be thought provoking. Whenever I have a few minutes, I like to listen to one or two. Very interesting!
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Adapter works great, does want it is intented to do what else can I can about it other than that.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  You could really put yourself in the story. It was interesting, funny and sad. Very different from anything i have read in a while. It's definitely worth the read.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is easy to play, but I dislike the ads that pop up at the start of EVERY game! If that were changed, I would give a higher score.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors. Winter of the World was exceptional.  The mixing of history and muti family stories excusite.  Spellbounding a real page turner and although it was a lengthy book I was ready to read more.  Ken does a fantastic job of mixing intrigue, love, and loss as well as informing the reader of historic details.  I can not wait for the 3rd in this series of the Century Trilogy.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Covers all the best songs in the whole movie. Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Best Cd ever with great singers and songs!
B00A757EFW|4.0|My son and my husband both love it. Thank you for providing such a great product.  I like it too.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|This is a bad comedy, a bad script. I wanted to enjoy it. Everything in the other reviews was right. Skip this.
B0036S4B2G|5.0|Recommended by my employer to me and all office managers must read too. It's interesting but somewhat over my head. I find myself going back and re-reading. The information about the different companies and ceo's which ones were good and great was as eye opener. Overall okay read.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I have always loved the Carpenters and their talent. The main reason I bought this album is for the song &#34;Merry Christmas Darling.&#34;This song has special meaning for me as I was in the Army when it was released and overseas and away from my sweetheart. It reminded me of her and how much I missed her.
B0096BIENY|5.0|excellant item and arrived well and before time.  These tenors are really great and always enjoy the sound.  Wish they were all in english but still love it.
B001CDZZI6|3.0|Do not know what I expected to find in this book but it seems that I did not get much. Some of what I found I already knew and some I did not agree with. It is a good book to better understand yourself as far as your strengths if you do not know them but if you know them, not worth it to find another way of expressing it. Although for me, not so great, it was still a good book to read.
1452110581|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It reminded me of many cats I have encountered in my life, and what might (heaven help us!) be going through their minds.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|wow wow wubbzy! it's sooooo fun! coin dozer 4 life! Holland!!!!!!!!!!!!!! l also love to kiss my dog on her little cheekers!
0399160450|2.0|I have not finished this book and am rating it so low not just for this reason, but because it is so large (over 800 pages) but deals with subjects (computers) that I am not sure how much it could be enjoyed by someone not really well grounded in that field.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is so much more than just a book. It's amazing. It literally took my breath away. Anytime anyone asks for a book suggestion it's the first thing I tell them. Warning- reading this book will make you want a Holder haha
0449227421|4.0|I am seldom disappointed in a Follett novel, and this was no exception.  What made it even more attractive to me is that the subject matter, even though farfetched, COULD happen.
1410450953|4.0|I appreciated her writing style, coming across as very believable in both the female and the male voices.  The premise was interesting, and I found the book to be an easy read.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The latest from William Landy is an entertaining novel but lacking in substance.  The plot premise is quite fascinating and it is the desire to know the truth that pushes you to the end.  The characters are flat and one dimensional which is frustrating because  thvBulletine plot gab  Landy so many places to let us into the inner narratives of the major characters. Instead the opportunity is squandered on the protagonist, the unlikable but relatable Andy.  Unlike other recent crime fiction from authors like Gillian Flynn Landy tries hi  best to ground Andy is some kind of reality he expects his reader to be familiAr with versus exploring the inherent darkness in this man besides a few lines touching on his physical impulsivity.
0385535147|3.0|Grisham cannot write a bad book, so The Racketeer was okay, but it did not have the tight plotting of his first several books.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This is an entertaining book that has an interesting plot.  Just about anyone reading will be able to predict the ending, but you sort of fall in love with both characters so it is interesting to see how they get to the end.  It is an ok read.
1250010403|5.0|Sir Jeffrey writes beautifully, and I believe I've read everything he's ever written (Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less being my favorite), but the ending to this book is just cruel.  To lead the reader up to the final moments when we NEED to know who is judged the heir, then leave us to wait months to know the outcome is, again, cruel.  I love his writing, so I'll wait, but it will be on pins and needles.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|my two boys love this game. my oldest is eight and then six. cant stop playing. going to buy full version. very creative also. great game!
8866130907|5.0|this agenda is the perfect size, and super-cute. much easier to deal with on my desk than the monster-sized planner i had last year, and more portable, too. don't know why i waited so long.
160459201X|5.0|Awesome book! This is a book that you need to read over and over to make sure you don't miss anything about it.
0395389496|5.0|Walmart and Target are selling this same book for TRIPLE the price here on Amazon! The shipping was SUPER fast considering I ordered it RIGHT BEFORE Christmas, and came EARLIER than estimated! The actually book itself was in perfect condition, it included a bonus CD and ornament for the tree. We buy a Christmas book for our twins every year and read it to them on Christmas eve night, and they LOVED this years pick. I would recommend ordering this version, specifically on Amazon, for anybody looking for a cute Christmas book for their kids!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Angry Birds of any kind is fun. I need to get better at it and spend more time with it. Cool figures and action.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great fun for traveling or anytime. I like the hints and easy movement of the cards. Good brain exercise for elementary school children to senior citizens.  Time well spent!
B0055SWM08|1.0|I do not enjoy this game. I find it pointless and frustrating. No real fun to it at all for me.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This CD was purchased for my 5yr old granddaughter she has the Brave doll.  I had the opportunity to view the movie and I loved it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Spider Solitaire is fun because of the challenge. Some deals are just not winable. I like trying to figure out if a different move of the same type will result in a different, more successful outcome.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This trilogy was easy reading and fast paced good for teens and adults.<br />I enjoyed all three.<br />I give it 4 stars
B000008B01|5.0|This is just a great CD from a true artist and, if you're patient, at a great price:  very happy.
0316044695|5.0|This book was read for my monthly Book Club.  This is a wonderful story about a true American young man with love of country, integrity, spirituality, and grit.  Marcus Luttrell is what is RIGHT about America and I thank him and commend him for his service, given so that the rest of us might continue to live free.  I cried as I read the last 30 pages, which is rare for me.
B00170MYIS|4.0|I was slightly disappointed as this battery has never held a very long charge, but it does work for a longer time overall, so is great for my &#34;day trips&#34; of photography.  Very reasonbly priced.
B00122BEPA|5.0|Amazon had this on sale for $5, how could you not get it! Van Halen is one of the greatest bands of all time, and this cd has a lot of great songs. A+
B007EECSFA|5.0|I was caught up in the story and was surprised with the ending, but it was still a great book!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I loved this book and it was super fast paced and provided a lot of answers left from the first novel (Maze Runner)  in the series.  It painted a more detailed picture of what happened to the world outside of the maze and what the condition of the world is now.  I flew through it and dove right into the final book when I was done!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Good stuff<br /><br />I watched the whole season in two days. Very funny and a great take on how the legal system works outside of the courtroom.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved this book!  For me a great book does three things - creates a 3 dimensional world for me to enter. While I am reading the book.  2. Creates characters that are so fleshed out and well developed that I actually care what happens to them.  3.  Creates an exciting story that causes me to read as fast as I can in order to find out WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN!!!  Maze Runner definately accomplished all three.  The author really kept me in suspense until the very end.  I loved it!!
B008458O3S|4.0|It's a slow paced puzzle game not a speed ot reflex type of game. Drawing tracks on a grid to route colored engines from their source to their destination without crashing into each other.<br /><br />Pretty slow to start (sort of a gradual learning pace) then it actually gets pretty complicated to avaid crossings and obsticles.<br /><br />Got it as a FAOTD... I'll probably keep it.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|I really loved the writer's style and his wry sense of humor- and it was an enjoyable story.  I just felt it was a little too vague and disjointed and left me feeling just mildly irritated that there was no cohesive explanation or ending - and yet ashamed to admit it because this book is a &#34;Classic&#34; and my admittance that I didn't really care for it will just be viewed as my admiitance to being too dense or not sensitive enough to the subtle nuances of blah blah blah.  It didn't really move me.  I just spent the entire book trying to determine whether Billy Pilgrim was actually time traveling or insane.
B009VB7P6G|2.0|I would have given it 3.5 if the movie didn't have the love story of the queen. Why can't a movie made for little girls without romance. It has nice graphics and emphasis on sisterhood.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|MILD POILER ALERT! The death cure is the third book in the maze runner trilogy.  I enjoyed reading it - but I have to admit I realized part ways into the book I was kind of at odds with where the story was clearly headed!  I still trusted WICKED and believed eventually they would be able to justify themselves!  Because I trusted Thomas was good and never would have done the wrong thing - I felt like therefore that vouched for WICKED!  When I eventually realized that was not where the story was headed I had to consciously stop myself from getting angry with Thomas for being such a resisting idiot and tell myself ti just go along with it.  I don't know if this is because the author didn't give us enough clues along the way (it seemed to me like he was encouraging us to trust wicked)  or if this just means I am an overly trusting fool who would give anyone the benefit of the doubt!  Either way -  good book great series!!!
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|There's nothing wrong with this movie. It's just not my kind of movie; hence, the reason for the neutral rating.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Fantastic app.  You can find how to do just about anything on this app.  It's a great place to share your own ideas, too.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|This book grabbed my attention from the first few paragraphs. I enjoy fantasy and was expecting a magical ride from beginning to end based on description of this book. The main character, Jacob, is a likeable enough boy in the beginning. Yet early on I felt like he had too many juvenile thoughts and reactions for a 16-year-old. Whence goes to the island and meets the peculiar children, the story briefly picked up speed again. The the last portion of the book becomes nothing more than page after after page of a hunt-and-chase scene with the children and a wight (never really understood what a wight was or what they were trying to accomplish). The plot escaped me. The ending, witless and dull, left plenty of room for a sequel but this reader has no interest in a sequel. This is not a book for an experienced reader. You will know each character's secrets all to easily.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is the best hidden objects game I have come across so far. For the people saying you have to pay when you run out of diamonds...YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY! I've been playing this game for awhile and I'm level 30 something. I have not paid any money to play this. You get 5 diamonds everythime you level up and when your energy runs out, you have to wait for it to replenish. So I don't know why people think you have to pay unless they are very impatient. This is not a game you're gonna finish overnight and so far the game does seem like it will never end which is a good thing.<br /><br />Also you came hit the friends tab and get friends who already play the game and they give you gifts which helps. Every time you finish one quest, there is another one waiting for you. So if you think you can't advance in the game without paying, then this is not the game for you and maybe you should just stick to pacman. But if you're looking for a good hidden objects game with lots of quest and you have patience, then this is the perfect game! The more you level up, the more energy you'll get.<br /><br />Great updates
B007MB5OCE|5.0|The title was enough to grab my attention, and after reading the summary there was no turning back! Sometimes it is time to allow an author to take you on a romp. I read the first paragraph while Jonas Jonasson took my hand and never let go. I developed a fondness and empathy for Allan, an elderly man who decided he was not done with life...and WHAT a remarkable life. This fella seems to fall into situations with flair and is quite debonair in the process. The insider look into significant historical and political events intertwined with Allan`s life made me laugh hysterically. With a cast of delightful characters thrown into a series of zigzaging incidents...the implausible becomes possible.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I like to listen to old time radio when I am working around the house or on the computer.  This program provides a good selection of a wide veriety of programing.
B0026NZR98|5.0|It's one of my all time favorite movies. The plane crash feels so real, and Tom Hanks is one of the best actors of his generation. A must have for your video library.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game.  I enjoyed the twists and turns and returning to the sites to complete puzzles and objects. Definitely worth the money and the time.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Steve is back with a monster of a novel that made one book.<br />I loved it and hated putting it down to resume life.  One thing you didn't tell me, Steve.  Where were you when JFK died?<br />Greg
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I am liking this book very much.  I haven't finished it yet but probably will in the next few days.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I use a kindle fire first and foremost. I have many issues with the game but before that the pros.<br />this game is very much like the Pc version allowing you to build the world around you and choose your ideal work through the use of seeds.<br />cons<br />map is ridiculously smaller than pc version. no dual thumbstick option for gameplay. d-pad button for left side with jump button in the center. all recipes are premade and listed (which actually helps new people). cannot add mode, would be nice to change texture pack or add features e.g. herobrine, smarter Ai, etc... needs the exp addition as well. health doesn't decay over time.<br />overall same game just needs to be updated/should be since I paid $7 for it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is a great app.  I like being able to see what the weather is going to be like on any given day and it helps me plan what to wear to work.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I finished this book only because I started it. Did not enjoy the story and found the whole book depressing.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I am addicted to Facebook.  I am on it most of the time when I am home, either on my home computer or my Kindle.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love that this game doesn't just stop after you achieve the first set of goals.  I also love that I don't need any money to continue playing!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just one of several games I like to play.  I enjoy it very much especially when I am waiting for someone or something, like in the Dr's office.

Well, I know exactly what they mean now. I couldn't wait to read this book each evening. It was well written with some great insight into what the operators of our special forces do, however you can tell no real secrets are given out. Very good book and I have already recommend the book to all my friends
B005DZMODI|4.0|Marsalis and Clapton have reached the point in their careers where they are free to explore the wonders of music and express themselves in many of its varieties.  More New Orleans style or Dixie Land than traditional Blues, any but the most jaded and inflexible of listeners is going to find pleasure in the 10 cuts on the album.  I deducted a star because the band shows signs of needing more time together (time that they are not likely to get) and because album production values are less than pristine.  That said, as (presumably) Taj Mahal can be heard saying as the last cut ends: \\"What a show\\"!
B0083V2VW8|5.0|An overall different kind of movie with the very best possible music soundtrack. It's the Who, what else can you say.
1451648537|5.0|I bought this copy as a Christmas gift for my brother and sis-in-law. I read the Kindle edition last year. Jobs was a fascinating mixture of the brilliant, creative and obnoxious in for me the new field of computers. I'm a Apple user, which may have led to my interest in reading this book and passing it on. I felt the obnoxious part of him was unfortunate and possibly unnecessary if he had been a happier person. But perhaps the genius combined with his questions and anger about being an orphan made that impossible.
0439023513|3.0|I didn't plan on reading this series. My husband brought it home and devoured the first one, so I gave it a try.<br /><br />I went through the first two fairly quickly. Very excited to find out how the story ended. What a let down.<br /><br />This entire book felt very disjointed and rushed. Suzanne Collins must really like using blackouts, mental illness or near death as a way to transition in this book, because it seemed she kept using it over, and over, and OVER.<br /><br />Seriously...how many times can Katniss black out? (In case you're curious-- its A LOT.)<br /><br />If you thought the second book had a rushed ending--- wait until you're reading this one. One minute, Katniss is going along and then, BAM, blackout and then hurry to tie up any loose ends she could and say adios.<br /><br />Did Ms. Collins have a certain number of pages to stick to? Did she suddenly get to XX page and realize \\"Holy cow-- I've got to finish this up! Somebody hurry up and hit Katniss in the head!\\"<br /><br />The story for many of the characters felt very, very rushed. The treatment (or shall I say, non-treatment) of Effie in this book surprised me. I don't know if I would have called her a main character in the previous ones, but definitely a supporting character. She deserved more time than they gave her.<br /><br />All in all-- if you read the first two, you're going to read this one. And...if you're like me...you're going to leave feeling...rushed? Disjointed? Or just wondering if that entire book was one big morpheling dose.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|After reading the trilogy, I really don't understand why the Fifty Shades books are as popular as they are.  The writing is really sophomoric and the plot and characters are unbelievable.  Stuck with it to see how it ends, but I certainly couldn't recommend.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|A long, long-time Steely Dan fan (I still anticipate the release of any new material like the teenager I was some forty years ago - hard to believe). Donlald Fagen is a genius who knows how to compose outstandingly hip and funky music for the ages. This CD will not disappoint anyone who appreciates his skillful use of witty, urbane lyrics paired with layered, subtle rhythms and harmonies. Great stuff from a great master of modern music.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This is supposed to be erotic?  I don't think so. The author just writes the same things using the same words over & over.  Characters are unbelievable and under-developed.  The plot reads like a high school girls diary.  Silly!
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Great movie, lots of action and fighting, crazy scenery and nutty people!  Can't tell you, but I loved the ending!
B009O2XY12|5.0|This game is very addicting!! Recommend it to everyone. Everyone in my house is now playing this game! LOVE IT
B0034JKZ86|5.0|One of the best Disney animated features ever. Kudos to Disney for stepping out of the politically correct realm and featuring someone as the heroine who isn't white. The copy is received came before the promised date and was in excellent condition.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Every time Led Zeppelin come on the radio my Brother yells, &#34;Led&#34; and we all get up and do a quick dance with the group.  When I saw the combo pack of their 2007 tour was coming out, I knew exactly what I was getting him for his birthday.<br />I was very surprised when the disc set arrived in less than 24 hours later and we were sitting in front of the 46 inch screen in the first row of the concert.  How awesome!  Shocking on the delivery time...very much welcomed.

B003LSTK8G|5.0|There should be more books like this that provide an insider perspective so we can get a diverse pool of experiences from the full range of wall street activities. Thanks Mr Lewis for a job well done.

B001GKJ2E8|4.0|funny..amazing..awesome..mind blowing..if only it was maybe possible..this having to have to many words required is a bit tiresome when there are only so many things to say
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I am not sure exactly how they rectify the idea that the birds are angry and possessive of their eggs with the Jedi teaching of emotional suppression and letting go of everything you love.  But, the game itself is fun and addicting, like all Angry Bird games are.  Except Rio.  Rio is dumb.
630587493X|5.0|Robin Williams is one of my all time favorite people. This movie is just awesome in it's progression of a robot.. to a man.
B00829GFZ0|5.0|This band shows a wide range of influences and melds them together into something that sounds fresh and unique! Take The Cult, Kyuss, GnR, The Stones, and the Black Crowes, throw them in a blender on HIGH, pour and enjoy!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book.....the author really knew how to keep you interested and I never wanted it to end.Just bought the 2nd one in the series of 3.I would highly recommend this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't even have words for how deeply thoughtful and amazing this novel is. It touched me on many levels and reminded me of the things that matter most. Please read it, you won't regret it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wild was recommended by a friend. I'm so glad I followed her recommendation.  I am awed by Cheryl Strayed. Talk about courage. The book is not only beautifully written, but inspirational as well.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a character-driven plot with terrific description of life's challenges.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|A good fantasy tale about time travel that has a few inconsistency but well worth it. Make up is exceptional.
1594484805|5.0|There is an epidemic in the United States of America. Managers who are simply psychogically immature tyrants who have no clue on how to manage well, and no nothing about the research literature on how to motivate their employees, and how to be successful managers. This book unlocks many misconceptions that the business world still follows, especially in challenging the old views of management that are both ineffective and inefficient. The book is good in general, but excellent if applied to business in new and creative ways.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|All I can say is the story itself wasn't that great, but who can deny the fact that Mr. Tatum is HOT HOT HOT.  Eye candy at it's best.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|So funny, my daughter, husband and me coul be watching this move every weekend......so much fun!!<br />Idefinetly recommend this one
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amazing mystery within a very well-written story!  Read it; I can't imagine someone not enjoying this book!  Have recommended it to all my friends and even ordered a hard copy for my choir director who doesn't have an e-reader.
0345803493|5.0|This book is not for rookies or the faint at heart. It is not well written, but it is a hot,sexy, steaming book.The main characters are very confusing, but confused in a loving, innocent, good way and you would not want to put the book down until you figure them out.
B00AZG5VB2|5.0|In case you have not noticed, the tv network sitcom is dying.  The few left in competition with this show have either been cancelled for next season, are on cable, are on BBC America or are the new combination called dramedy, like Nurse Jackie and The Big C (a mix of comedy and drama). This show and the THE MIDDLE are about the only two left which I watch on network tv.  They are both great and are released together.<br /><br />If you've never watched it, it is about an extended family in LA and their attempts to get along. There is the patriarch who is remarried to a younger Colombian wife.  There is his son, a gay lawyer with a football playing, farm boy, musical comedy partner.  They have an adopted daughter. Finally, there is seemingly the conventional heterosexual daughter with husband and three children.  Ironically, it is this last family, four seasons in, which now seems the craziest part of the extended family.<br /><br />For those of you who have watched it by now you have probably vacillated, as have I, on your favorites.  It took me awhile but hands down my favorite is now Phil, played by Ty Burrell, the real estate salesman. He is the most developed, nuanced, and comedic of all of these characters.  I love every moment he is onscreen. Originally I liked the gay couple most but that has waned some since their main comedic bit is that they are gay.  Four seasons in they need to become more nuanced comedically. Phil's wife has also become more nuanced.  She can be a real pain at times and thus a terrific foil for Phil.<br /><br />Another reviewer here has commented that the Colombian accent bit used by Gloria with her husband Jay has become grating and they need to cut that back by twenty percent.  Until he wrote this I hadn't realized it but it has become grating.  Her thick Colombian accent four seasons later is just not that funny.<br /><br />I also enjoy the way all of the kids are coming along, especially Phil's kids in interaction with him.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Love this character, especially the early books.  High recommend.  Lee Child is an excellent writer and I look forward to reading all of the Jack Reacher books.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|Loved this movie. Coraline is such an amazing character, in such an amazing world. I recommend this to adults and children alike,
B004YM6JLO|5.0|There was no question about this for me. The Vampire Diaries is my favorite show out there. I think it is replaces Charmed as my all time favorite.
B004APVI1G|5.0|This is an excellent movie - seen it in theater but had to own it too!  The price was also great.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love supernatural. Took me a friend explaining stuff that happens in the 4th and 5th seasons so I just had to start collecting them and I am glad I did. One of my favorite shows.

0765316994|4.0|I remember reading John Scalzi's &#34;Old Man's War&#34; a few years ago in one long night - I could not put it down.  I actually had a similar experience with &#34;Redshirts,&#34; although in this case I read it in a few hours after work (it's pretty short).  I am a regular reader of Scalzi's blog, I've read a few of his other books, and I've even been fortunate to see him speak on a panel, so I would definitely consider myself a fan.  I've read a few of the other reviews, and this is my take-away from this book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed &#34;Redshirts.&#34;  The plot is pretty basic to begin with and the characterizations are purposefully shallow.  The plot and the &#34;meta&#34; aspects of the book are really the point.  Most of the characters are barely described - just given rudimentary back stories (which really IS the point) and for the most part no physical descriptions.  In my mind Q'eeng, for example, was clearly supposed to be some sort of alien (i.e. Spock), but we're given no information on this &#34;stock character.&#34;  The only character who's somewhat physically described was Jenkins (&#34;yeti&#34;-like).<br /><br />Again, I think it's clear given the fact that this was a shout out to poorly written Sci-Fi shows that all of this was done on purpose.  My one complaint was that it ends somewhat abruptly, and that the codas didn't give me personally as much closure as I would have liked, but I was particularly moved by the last one, focusing on the Jenkins/ Margaret storyline.  I really didn't expect to find such a touching development in the book.  I had to give my fiance a hug after that one.  Oh, and what are people's thoughts on the Hanson character?  Who do you think he was/is?<br /><br />So, overall, this isn't Shakespeare, but it was a short, enjoyable satire with some surprising moments of depth.  Well done Mr. Scalzi.  I'm looking forward to reading &#34;The Human Division&#34; next!
B0090EJR1K|2.0|not as good as BORAT. Only funny in a few sequences.Don't bother renting this movie. I made a mistake and thought it would be as good as his other movies
079070546X|5.0|Looked every where for this movie, glad we found it. You should add this one to your collection . Great movie
B007NU54H4|5.0|By daughter loved it, and it arrived 1 week sooner then expected.  She was so happy when she opened it Christmas Day!
0761169253|1.0|Took about 10 minutes to read the whole thing. Its just a few quotes and general ideas surrounded by annoying handwritten titles and uninspiring pictures.<br /><br />This is 100% a blog post in print format. Do not waste your money.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I'm a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and was dying to read this one! It was my first purchase on my new kindle and it was well worth it!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This cover got your 7\\" Kindle Fire HD not only works great, it looks really good too.  I've gone through two other covers in search of one that provides functionality and looks without being too expensive and this cover hits all the criteria.<br /><br />I love how easily the Kidnle Fire HD slips into this cover and yet, remains secure.  The fact that it provides rotation only makes it sweeter.  The look from the outside is sleek and high tech and the inside has a modern velvet/felt look that provides great cushion and impact protection.  The cover resists smudges which is a plus with small kids in the house.  The price point is not bargain but not expensive either and since I can see no drawbacks, I think it's worth every cent.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Ellen writes the same way she speaks on her show...it appears to be whatever pops in her head. I was expecting more about her life experiences in her book, not just a comiedic dialogue.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The actors cast as the Bennet family, of course!  Keira Knightley is wonderfully watchable and Jena Malone has been around forever; Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan(!) and Talulah Riley have gone on to do some great things!  Stately Donald Sutherland always delivers and Brenda Blethyn's flibbertigibbet flightiness is perfect as the feckless matriarch.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Downloaded to my kindle fire with no problems. Great graphics and fast play. I am 50/50 won one lost one. As another player stated it does take a. long time to load but I think it is worth the wait.
B004OYUNTG|5.0|This is a great watch, especially for the price. It's a good size; not overly large like some watches today, but bigger than some of the previous Casio watches. Has a good weight to it as well.<br /><br />The buttons are large and easy to press, and the auto hand set feature makes setting the hands much, much easier (especially when DST rolls around, or changing time zomes) than previous Casio models I've had where the hand set was separate and you had to hold the tiny button down for 5 minutes till it slowly worked its way back around. The LED is pretty useless, much too dim to read the digital portion and not really needed to read the hands as they glow anyway.<br /><br />The band is plenty large. It uses the watch band link pins with the little detent on them which makes them pretty hard to remove unless you have a pair of watch band sizing pliers. I couldn't get the pins out with a punch. So plan on a trip to the jewelry store to have the band sized when you get it, or order a pair of sizing pliers and do it yourself.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|May be one of the most important books you'll ever read. I read it years ago and it has never left my mind. And while I still have my original copy I thought it worth adding to my Kindle so I can always have it with me.
034580404X|4.0|I bought these books to see what everybody was talking about. I did get engrossed in the story and erotica, but finally was ready for them to end. Fun escape.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I have no complaints for this case at all. I am sure more expensive ones are good as well, but this one suits me fine. I would recommend it for the Kindle Fire HD.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|If you have a job that depends on the economy being good, it is a great way to kill the hours between customers.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a heart-warming story of a dog's loyalty to his owner.  Although this is a true story, the movie was updated and modernized.  This is a definite must see movie for any family (it is rated G).  For all you fuzzy-hearted dog lovers, get a box of Kleenex.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Love the story of the two that were brought together from a past....... good story, and great ending.  Loved it!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This is how Judge Dredd should have been portrayed in the first version. Karl Urban is perfect for the role of Dredd.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is by far one of the best action hero movies I seen.  The script is superb and the cast outstanding.  Computer generated images were just enough to hold the liveliest of skeptics attention, like my grand children.  Yes it was clean enough for them to watch and it was purchased as their Christmas present.  I have watched it twice and would watch it again.  Worth the price.
1451627297|5.0|An excellent choice for those who collect the best.This is the first one and would be an excellent beginning to the world of Steven King
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|It was like &#34;Aliens&#34; at first before they got on this ship!  If you think about it, I am right!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me guessing the whole time.  The characters are intriguing.  You never know what they will do next.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|The CD is great but, the soundtrack is a great individuall effort!  I play guitar so, I get it! *
1407130366|5.0|I loved this trilogy! I read all three within a weeks time. The unexpected plot twists keep you guessing! Awesome!!
B000002TWN|5.0|Excellent!  I love this CD because, he had 2 but, I have one for all!  Great music for everybody, I said!
B0002SROT0|5.0|My favorite album from Elliott Smith...he really gave his all on this album! Some of the songs remind me of Heatmiser(his old band...) then others are completely unique...
B000SGRONM|5.0|My first Sedaris book was &#34;Naked&#34; and now I am hooked!  Read this one through Christmas and New Years and enjoyed every second!!
B00000064F|5.0|Anything from Nick Drake is excellent!!! i own Pink Moon, 5 leaves left, and bryter layter...i wouldn't trade them for anything
B000ZOW96Y|4.0|This movie was an intelligent, fun, on the edge of your seat suspense. Very well casted and acted. I love George Clooney and Brad Pitt together. One of thise movies that is Worth seeing again and again!
0790729393|4.0|The 1st DVD I received did not work, and started to play somewhere in the middle of the movie. Also was not in the condition advertised. The seller immediately replaced it, and I was very satisfied with the replacement shipment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|hey everyone guess what minecraft is the best game in the app store!! I think u should get it its worth every penny everyone I know plays minecraft now all minecraft pocket addition needs to have updates like an xbox!  please let me start with a map to. thx!!!!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Why? Because like eateries, my opinion is based on my taste, background, persuasions, etc. For the review to be truly valid, we likely have to share the same experiences, likes and dislikes. That said, I liked this movie, though not as well as the first one. It was kind of the same ol stuff, cast of characters and plot lines, but this time with a little twist.  I though the bad guy was a little boring and overdone, the plot a little thin, but overall I was entertained. I was particularly moved by the ending scenes which seperated this one from the rest in the series. I particularly enjoyed Josh Brolin's young characterzation of a young Agent K, really quite convincing.<br />I liked it, but that's only my opinion.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book was very lame. Touted as the book to read after Fifty Shades,it should have made me feel something other than boredom. Even the sex scenes had a sameness about them. This could be called Bored by You.
B009OWE87Q|4.0|If you enjoyed seeing Grace in The September Issue, you will enjoy reading her memoirs as it's written in her own voice; you can quite easily imagine her chatting away with you as you read.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|once you start this game its hard to put down.excellent game if you are looking to waist several hours in day
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was so interesting and engaging that even though it is long, it took me less than 2 weeks to read.  The story of a man who goes back in time to attempt to prevent the assassination of President Kennedy had me on the edge of my seat and reading every moment I had the opportunity!  Don't get scared off by it being a Stephen King book, because although it has its tense and thriller moments, it is not a typical scary book.  One of the best books I've read.  Read it -- you won't regret it!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|A MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE. THERE ARE DIFFERENT CHALLENGING LEVELS EACH ONE MORE FUN AND ADDICTING THAN THE OTHER ONE
0847835073|5.0|so do yourself a favor & buy this. Monica Bellucci is one of the most breathtaking women ever & this beautiful collection of various photographers pictures capture her perfectly. The paper quality is excellent & the book is impeccably rendered. 5 stars for Monica & this piece dedicated solely to her.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|*Please do not troll on this review. This is not my account and the review is a class assignment*<br /><br />  I love Jane Eyre. I grew up watching the Masterpiece Theater version on Sunday nights. The first time I read the book was in middle school. So, needless to say, I was super excited when I heard there was another adaptation of the book being produced. We bought the DVD as soon as it came out. All I can say was that I was kind of disappointed. For people who have never read the book they would have gotten the general gist of the movie. But I felt like if you hadn't read the book you wouldn't really know  the story this adaptation portrayed. The actors of this movie I really enjoyed were Judi Dench and Tamzin Merchant. I'm slightly inclined to like Mia Wasikowska, though, because we have the same birth day and because I really enjoyed her in the modern Alice in Wonderland.<br />  The movie only seem to hit the top events which made it confusing. I was able to follow along because I've read the book. But I found myself adding in the parts the movie didn't have. The setting was wonderful and Focus Features seemed to get the clothes right. But she was still too done up for the character Jane. I gave this movie three stars because it wasn't completely horrible and I could tolerate watching it again.<br /><br />  ~Sara Monteen
B000002NHN|5.0|I enjoy this CD very much. My grandson enjoys it also it helped to put him to sleep when my daughter had a hard time to putting him to sleep, other then that, It relaxes me.
B005LAII12|5.0|It looked stupid and I had my reservations but I laughed literally out loud at half of this movie.<br />I bought it as a X-mas gift for a couple people last year I liked it so much.
B001HN6922|5.0|my son has the first one so he was very exited about this one, he loves it so i am very happy
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved, Loved, Loved this book. Their love story was amazing, deep, genuine and sincere. I was hooked on this book; it even made me cry! I think all girls can wish for a love like this. Truly a great book.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|enjoyed the book but predictable about half of the way through everything just kind of tied in too neatly at the end
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Flow Free is actually really fun.  And mentally stimulating.  Which is why it is so unfortunate that we had to delete it from our kindle fire, after we found it has hidden in-app charges.  In a total of 1 hour of playing time between the five members of our family we were charged nearly $15 in fees that we were never given the opportunity to approve or deny.  Amazon was great and reversed the charges, but I'm hoping to make others aware that this app creator is adding sneakily hidden charges.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. I have a five year old daughter so that added more to the read for me.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|this was a present for my 7yr. old nephew. he finds it very challenging but he loves his perplexus epic.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love this story. Somewhat challenging to read due to the old English, but such a powerful story none the less.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Very good repentation of that time, per stories I have heard .  If you history& action you will like it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. I can not get enough of zombie movies, but you put in an emotional story line with great acting, plus the thrill of a &#34;horror' movie and I am one happy person. I do not have AMC to be able to watch this as it happens, so like an addict, I watch them all back to back after they are released. I could re-watch seasons one and two again, so good!
0765325950|5.0|Bitter- sweet. Good ending to great series. Would of like some hanging questioned answered but I also like how my imagination is the beginning of the Fourth Age. Life goes on for our friends and that is what the Last battle was about. And I can always return to their world anew by starting again at the beginning of the Wheel of Time.<br /><br />As far as the e-version goes. Yeah I whined about it not being released till April and then like a grown up I got over it and ordered a hard cover copy. For those of you who choose to wait cause its no big deal, then more power to you cause I could not wait. For those who are still whining and giving one star reviews, get over yourself.  And for those of you not buying the book because you can't get your way, your loss. Jordan's wife wanted it this way for reason of her own. Maybe if Robert still lived he would of done it differently but like the last few books, we will never know.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Again , this was a gift for someone who has been wanting it for a long time so I was very happy to locate it at amazon
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Installed this on my Kindle Fire, works great, alarm works even when the tablet is closed. Also easy to use.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe right now is my favorite season! I love all the great twists in the plot, and Walter is awesome! Oh, and shipping was really great too! It came in just two days.
1564148793|5.0|good book, I read it a while back. its really about using your mind with certain rituals that enforce the idea that we are protected by the power of the divine to feel safe for various bad energies.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Evidently it was a good thing.  My daughter was pretty happy to get this.  I am personally not a fan beyond thinking they are sweet cute little boys but she was pleased.
1607066017|5.0|Saga is a story about a baby girl born from to fueding races, it's kind of like if Romeo and Juliet didn't commit suicide, and had a baby and ran away to have it.  The baby could be the key to peace on both worlds, but there a lot more at stake, and both sides what them and their baby killed.  It gets interesting when bounty hunters get hired.<br /><br />This graphic novel is high on sex and nudity, and has plenty of graphic images.  The love story keeps the novel well grounded, and makes it very believable.  The narrative is from the perspective of the baby girl all grown up thinking about the past, and how she was raised, which is very well done, and one of the best narrative devices, I've seen done in a long time.<br /><br />I recommend this book for any one that wants to read a great story , the violence and sex might turn off some people, but i enjoyed them, it makes sense in the story and the art is really well done.
B00942S4OY|5.0|Hey I am happy if she is happy.  I really don't have much more to say about this than that :)
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|One of the best hidden object games I've played.  G5 hit a home run with this one!  Plot is interesting, plenty of twists &amp; turns.  Great FUN.  Good for hours of entertainment for a reasonable price.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this was a great book, I love the way Colleen tells a story!  I read her Slammed series too and that was great, can't wait to read another one from her.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was amazing!! I've read a few of Colleen Hoover's books and I love every one of them! Although, this book was quite hard to get in to. Luckily once I got sucked in to the book I couldn't put it down.. And there were a few parts towards the end I didn't like. But that was just because what was happening. It was all a part of her story but she makes it seem so real life. As though it's happening in front of you. And that's great. But it was what was going on that made me disgusted. Ugh. Push thru and continue to read the book. You'll be glad you finished it!!!! It is absolutely a keeper!!!!! LOVED IT! :)))
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've only seen the first three episodes of Season 3 but it looks like it's going to be another winning season!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|A great version of a Brothers Grimm tell. Great acting and special effects and I will watch it again :)
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun game.  I like that I can choose different settings.  I don't like the ads however, but would still recommend the game to people that like solitaire.
B0045XGRQE|4.0|Not as good as the first one, but still very good! Need to watch these along with Thor, The Hulk, Captain America, before watching The Avengers !
B007HACDLK|5.0|His stories are so timely and filled with events happening right before our eyes. Mitch is a great character .
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Kindle will not let me download this game.  Not happy!!!!!  I paid for it.  I would like to be able to use it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly weaves a good story and we always enjoy all his writing even when it is not Harry!! We always look forward to his next offering.
0375851569|4.0|I bought this set for my 2 year old daughter. I took a shot thinking she might be ready for them, she's not. She doesn't understand the rhythms and style of writing just yet. I tried to focus a bit more on the illustrations without any luck. We'll try again in 6 months.<br /><br />With that said these books are the same Dr Seuss books I grew up with. Maybe a bit smaller but the content is the same.
0743289692|5.0|Infidel is a remarkable book highlighting the brave and courageous life of Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Ayaan takes us through her life in Somalia as a young child to Kenya, Saudi Arabia, and eventually Holland in which she escaped an arranged marriage. She takes us through her being genitally mutilated and the beatings she took in the Islamic society she grew up. She tells us the story of her sister and her loving relationship with her. Her life story is a truly remarkable one. She takes us to Holland where she was able to escape the grip of her arranged marriage as she was able to educate herself through university and later became a Dutch member of government. She takes us through the days in which her film produce Theo van Gogh was slaughtered in the streets of Amsterdam for simply producing a short film with Ayaan. She takes us through her days of hiding and her eventual landing in the United States and her eventually accepting reason and giving up religion completely.<br /><br />Ayaan's story is a remarkable story in which one must read. A truly remarkable life story from a true heroine and hero of our time.
1451696191|5.0|Great book! I am reading it again after a few years and then will see the movie they just made based on the book! This is one of my top five favorite books. :)
0981951252|5.0|I have gained extreme insight into how to be successful and gain 'momentum' of achievement in anything I want to accomplish. Excellent and easy to understand. Author Darren Hardy is great!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|All your books are just the kind you can't put down<br />It's incredible how much I can relate to this story loved it just loved it
0375842209|5.0|This book, written through the eyes of Death, is intriguing and kept me wanting to read more.  A true page turner.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|The little pet shop game is cool and it well get your child of the couch and go play this cool game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Good job of depicting all characters and situations. His attempt to understand the business numbers was a little too long, otherwise the action held my interest non stop. Well written insight into Reacher's personality. Lots of names to remember, had to go back and take some notes. It was apparently first written in 2006 when the paperback(MM) came out in Europe. The hard cover was released here in 2009. So well written. I have only read six Reachers to date but this is by far my favorite.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is so much fan I just think it is so addicting after so long every time I get a tablet I make sure I get temple run first
140053271X|5.0|Ordered for our granddaughter for Christmas.  She asked for it last year after seeing mine.  She started using it right away.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great for the kindle. The action is really smooth. The ads aren't that much of a problem they only show up as you deal and no other times.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this novel. The contents make a hopeless romantic melt. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to believe the happy ends exists.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is by far the best mini series that I have seen to date. The cast is wonderful the clothes are chic and I look forward to every episode. I can hardly wait for it to come out in DVD si I can watch it over and over again. Thank you Julian Fellows.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|do not let me see u on this because if I do it is going to be some yelling up in the house ok now get it stripe
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This fun little game lasted quite a long time (compared to similar ones).  It had a variety of search types, based on description, outline and translucency.  The plot was so-so, but I did feel I got my money's worth with just the number of search screens.  A good time waster.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book was amazing and I looked up the website and I read the 1st book too. I also have the 3rd book.
8186336141|5.0|This is one of the most systematic, clear, concise and authentic works on Hatha yog practices that I am familiar with. The book does not assume any previous knowledge. It brings into view that the Hatha system is not simple gymnastics seeking to bring the body to health; indeed, if followed seriously over a period of time, the depth and duration of mediation will improve naturally.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|so addicting! found myself dreaming of it! love the challenge it made me feel like a genius! how many more words can I say before it allows me to send?
030758836X|5.0|This is the third of Gillian Flynn's novels.  I read the first, Sharp Objects, liked it but I passed on the second.  I had not planned to read Gone Girl but it was talked about all last year and wound up on just about every 2012 Best Book list. So I took a chance and I am so glad that I did. I was well aware of the basic plot - a wife disappears on her fifth wedding anniversary and there is evidence of foul play, and that's all I'll mention about the plot.  But I do want to write a few words about what I liked so much about the book.  I give very few 5 star ratings, something less than 10% of what I read, but I never had any doubts about the story once I got into it.  It is told in a very interesting fashion, not just the he said, she said alternating chapters, but we are hearing the wife's voice via her diary beginning just before she met her husband. The husband's, Nick, story is told from the day the wife, Amy, went missing and then each day thereafter.  There are many surprises along the way and after the first 30-40% the book is very hard to put down, and I rarely say that about any book.  The writing is just excellent. Twists aside, the characters are always true to the picture we are painted early on and you get the feeling you know these people inside out.  Yes, the story builds to a great climax, but this is one of those rare stories where it is not about the climax.  It's the whole story, A to Z, and what we learn about these two people and the dozens of others who are critical characters.  So far I don't think I have said anything that hundreds of reviewers haven't already mentioned - but I can add one observation that particularly resonated with me.  After reading \\"Gone Girl\\" I will never follow an ongoing investigation into a major \\"breaking news\\" murder, abduction, or whatever (eg OJ Simpson, JonBenet Ramsey) with the same set of assumptions as I had before. Flynn skewers the casts of these \\"reality shows\\" so perfectly and mercilessly. And for that reason alone I will certainly read Flynn's next.son alone I will certainly read Flynn's next.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the best books in its genre that I have ever read and one of the best books that I have read in a long time!<br /><br />I agree with Mr Blehm's Afterward; reading the last few chapters was heart-wrenching.  I knew the outcome, but wanted it to come out differently.  I'm not ashamed to say that I openly wept through most of the ending.<br /><br />I told my wife what was best about this book was that I believe any woman who read it would think of Adam \\"That's the kind of man I'd like to marry.\\"  Likewise, any man who reads it would feel, \\"That's the kind of man I would like to be.\\"  And not just because Adam was a highly trained, deadly man who served his country and the Constitution.  He was positive in all things.  He was one of the most elite highly trained war fighters in the world, yet enjoyed bubble baths and batman underwear.  He was a kid at heart and a man of intense spiritual faith.  He was the kind of spouse and the kind of father that I will continue to aspire to be.  He was selfless in the extreme.<br /><br />What made this story even better, to me, was the relationship between Adam and Kelley Brown.  No marriage is without its blemishes.  But what I saw in their marriage was complete maturity and a true understanding between two humans bonded in soul.  Theirs seemed to be a marriage of trust, belief, and love in its most perfect, perhaps spiritual sense.<br /><br />God Bless the Brown family.  Godspeed Adam.
B0000DEOAI|5.0|A new music idiom, bold, complex, layers of meaning and sound. Use for film sound effects and rattle the listeners and viewers.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I did not realize(because i didn't read the descriptions all that closely) this is the CD of the Beatles collection they used for the Cirque Du Soleil show \\"LOVE\\". Other then a couple of minor changes to the music- adding more Orchestra to the songs was one example. So this is not purely just a collection of the Beatles best but still very much a very enjoyable CD.
B005HSL626|1.0|I got it right? It worked PERFECTLY until just recently. Then, it totally busted on me. The app won't even turn on! And, even after I sent multiple 'feedbacks' to halfbrick, they REFUSED to fix it!
B0083Z614S|5.0|An absolute 5 star read. Great for readers 10-13 years old.  Introduces a \\"Yorkshire\\" style of speech that is sure to entertain.
B0012HQKZE|1.0|I'm not very good at writing reviews, but I can say that this movie stinks.  If you want a good laugh, watch it.  Anthony Hopkins plays a billionaire (apparently one with Asperger's syndrome) who knows &#34;everything&#34; (but in a good way), especially the fact that most people who die after becoming stranded die &#34;of shame.&#34;  I think Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin should have died of shame for being in this clunker.
B005QUQ99K|4.0|Perfect Holiday Gift or anytime gift for any kid.  Product picture matches exactly to what you receive in the mail.
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|This movie was crazy, a tad bit gory. Kinda reminded me of Quentin Tarantino's early work but it was really good. Did not expect the outcome but it leaves you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out what's gonna happen next.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This fun app was a great hit at our family Christmas family gathering.  We had great fun and it was easy to use.
B009VB97EY|4.0|The quality of acting was subpar and the plot and especially the end left you wondering like what the hell is supposed to happen next. Left it unfinished. BUT the dancing was delicious and sooo sexy
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not stop reading it, it was so good. I can not wait to read the next book. Simply amazing.
B0095R76EW|3.0|It was alright. I give it 2 and 3/4 stars if I could because it wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas, and he was very happy with it, so I am happy as well.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Reading the first book, you want to finish the entire story. Book as so many more details than movie. Wonderful read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was moved by emotions of terror, being furious one minute and happy with a possible real romance, the next. I was so into this Trilogy, I couldn't put the book down. This coming from a person that never liked to read. Well that<br /> has changed now. I would not recommend these books for under fourteen year olds.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I love relaxing to the sounds at bedtime,and mixing the different ones makes this a pretty cool app..enjoying this app.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Daughter still has her original Perplexus from when she was a child (approx. 13).... she is now 25.  She freaked out!  Thanks so much.  It got here in plenty of time to wrap instead of the -- last minute ditch it into a gift bag --  routine.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|All time fav author.  This story is today's news.  He's also very funny.  My favorite book ever is Charm School.
B004QL7K70|5.0|Thank you! Fast service. I remember watching this for the first time. I was in shock with how out of control the movie gets.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|It seems to be a fun game but is indeed challenging. It took me several tries to figures out how to actually 'build' the structures. I am currently stuck on a particularly hard level. Kind of frustrating. Overall, it passes the time.
B009EAALII|5.0|We went to a Chris Isaak concert last year and this video is very similar to the concert we attended. High Energy, and fun to watch.
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|sounds super cute but will not open. forced close twice. have not even be able to play at all. will delete soon
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Stephen King is a wonderful writer and this story is compelling, with vivid characters, and written in an era I remember well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it  Being able to hear the words as i read is great.  Love the voice of the reader! thanks
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Didn't really enjoy it as much as I thought. I think it was long and boring and confusing. It had some good parts but I don't think I would read it again.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I had a guy a lot like Travis but mine was unfortunately too narcissistic and less caring.  Did not work out for me.  Wish mine had been like this.
1609611543|5.0|For you interested in health and nutrition this is an eyeopener. A great book to set you on the right track to health.<br />Lots if info. about wheat that I didn't know. Even whole wheat and other grains.<br />This book makes a good gift.
B004HWT6DO|4.0|An intriguing look into the beginnings of the social networking site Facebook, well acted and timely, given our current preoccupation with social networking sites.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It took you a while to get into the book,but about half way through it really got going and was a really good book! Would of gave all stars if I did not take so long to get going!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book ! It's full of different feelings!! I definitely recommend this book to n e one who is open minded !
B0055SWM08|1.0|Not all of us have internet connections all the time. That is when you need a game the most and this won't work.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There is nothing more that I can say. This book is simply amazing! It's a must read!! So much of it was so perfect you felt as though you were right there with the characters
0670451495|5.0|This is a timeless book that has been passed down from genration to generation.  It will NEVER disappoint a child!!
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Yep, TI has done it again...Another SWAG Official hit! Tight lyrics, head-bussa beats, and the presentation is nothing less than exceptional.
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|We bought all the Piano Master apps because my kids love playing them. Everything was good and fun until a week later all of the piano apps had no sound. The volume is up, it's not muted, and nothing in the settings is for volume. The sound works for all other game apps except the piano ones. I don't understand and honestly it makes me mad we spent money on a game that doesn't work. So I do not recommend buying this game.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Don't like it, can't even use it to play a  simple television show on my 32gb Nexus 7 tablet :-(
B000V63A4G|5.0|John is flat out amazing as a world class guitarist, & a really good vocalist as well. The rest of the line up is awesome as well, & the songwriting & production are top notch. I wish they had enjoyed more success & could have given us more than 2 studio & 1 live albums. This was a fantastic band! I wore out my cassette years ago, & it's great having this back in my collection.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I got this one because it lets me edit some things on form and such that I could not before because the others were just viewers basically.

B004JC16LC|5.0|If you are obsessed with Furtwangler's style and artistry, as I am, this set is a necessity. Some of the performances are not ones I would choose to listen to over more modern recordings and interpretations (Bach Brandenburg #3), and some are beyond magnificent (Beethoven's 3rd and 9th Symphonies, among others). However, all are worth listening to and studying.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Easy and fun to play I really love the game so much I highly recommend this game to everyone who likes point and click games
B007C94XG4|5.0|I haven't seen a chipmunk movie in 20 years, but I really enjoyed it.  My 2 year old thinks it's pretty funny as well.
B003L77GRO|5.0|What can I say about Dexter!  I watched him the first season when we didn't have to pay for it, but then they went to Showtime.  Since then, I have had to buy the series.  I have not watched these yet, but I know I will love them!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Great Addition to the Cousins War series, interesting take from the side of the wife of a Lancastrian and York heir
B005FISBTO|5.0|What can I say about Dexter!  I watched him the first season when we didn't have to pay for it, but then they went to Showtime.  Since then, I have had to buy the series.  I have not watched these yet, but I know I will love them!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Barbara<br /><br />This cd has it all.  Since I only have the very first cd from Kelly I thought this would be a good addition - and I was right! The way this girl puts out consistent good songs...I look forward to Chapter Two!<br />The price was right (offered at Holiday special) and it arrived promptly.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|The DVD came in excellent condition and is, as we all know, a Christmas classic. This was a gift and the recipient loves it.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Barbara<br /><br />Read the reviews, decided it was worth buying...and glad I did. Bought one for a Christmas gift and one for myself. It turned out to be the favorite Christmas cd of this season (2012) - and may hold that title for years to come. This is a listening delight!<br />Bought as a Holiday special, so the price was screaming good, and it arrived promptly!
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|Dice certainly seemed to be slanted toward the computer expecially with the doubles.  It becomes a real expected roll of doubles exactly when needed for the computer not for the player.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eden's experince of unbelievable peace, sense of God - so awesome that he understood why judaism did not name God - no name could fix his - what he is - gave me many spiritual moments.<br />Itw as a super read.
B008MM9630|4.0|Fairy Farm is a great game so far. It's not as complicated as I thought it would be. The only thing that I don't favor as much is that some stuff cost a lot but I guess it just makes for a challenging game.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Very addictive! More fun than original solitare. I play it  just about everyday. Gotta love the price! (lol) FREE! only problem I have had is sometimes it freezes.
B004HW7JMY|1.0|Could not watch it due to incorrect zoning.  Didn't think to look for zoning when ordering.  I think Amazon should consider making the zoning more obvious for purchasers in different zoning areas.  I purchased the collection again at a local retailer and i must say we are thoroughly enjoying it - a bit gori, blood, guts etc. and a lot of sex scenes.  A interesting story line!!!!
B005WBBYXO|5.0|An excellent set.  Go ahead and get the omnibus instead of just the first book.  If you read the first story you will want to read the next two.
B0084RSYEK|1.0|Very juvenile.. Murphy can do much better work.. I think? Do not waste your money.. not funny at all... I want a refund
B000NOK06W|5.0|Este cd es absolutamente espectacular. Increible la seleccion tan completa.<br />Sonido perfecto, buenas grabaciones<br />Altamente recomendado.<br />Que viva Ennio Morricone
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Text to Speech and the ability to export notes and highlights from personal documents make this a must have for Kindle Fire users that want to save and work with their notes.

1401322786|5.0|A young person who wants time to &#34;speed up.&#34;  An old person who wants time to &#34;slow down.&#34;  I have been in both places and could relate so well to the characters in Mitch Albom's latest book.  &#34;Why does God limit our number of days? to show us each one of them is precious.&#34;  A better appreciation of how we spend our time which will one day run out for all of us.  Hug somebody you love, call your mama, help out a needy person, show kindness to everyone for &#34;The Time Keeper&#34; is clicking away the moments of our lives - make them count.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven<br />A great read, I really enjoyed the book and now I'm going to wait till the movie comes out.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|the only negative thing i can say about this show is that i could not quit watching it! seriously one of the best shows on!
0060936223|4.0|Brought back lots of memories of that time. Good and bad times. Patti's book was well written, too. Glad I read it.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|loved the nail biting twist!!!!!!!!!cudo's  it was amazing,send more of these my way. i love a good scary shocker movie
B000WGWQG8|3.0|I had read and enjoyed the biography.  I suppose with a book you can stop reading when you get bogged down with facts.  With the DVD it seemed to be work to continue watching.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|I don't know how I missed this when it was on Broadway. As a fan of Rent, I enjoyed Idina Menzel and was blown away when I saw her singing in a highlight from Wicked on a public television program. I enjoyed this original cast recording, and wish someone would make a movie so I could enjoy watching it again and again. It could be the new Wizard of OZ.
B005DOKL3E|4.0|I was looking for something with a pocket for the charging cord and something a little more heavier in weight.<br />It is nice for my Kindle Reader but not for my Fire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I Love this game.  I already had it on my phone, so when I got my Kindle I had to add it to my Favorites.  I play it every day.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Since this is a book, I was actually expecting to read a better version of the fan-fiction I liked so much.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I found that, unlike the one on my IPod Touch, the one on my Kindle Fire HD did not display very good videos.  The one I downloaded that was labeled as HD came out fine.  But the others that were not HD don't look great on my Kindle Fire HD.  Maybe it's because the device is HD.  I don't know the reason.  But there are some YouTube videos that are actually unwatchable.  Others are watchable, but not very good.  This was a disappointment.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OmG what a great book!! Getting ready to read BOOK 3...I so looking forward to it!! Loving this series of books!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I haven't sat down and compared this word for word with the computer version, but it seems to do everything it's supposed to do and it is quite resposive.  A must for your Kindle Fire HD, or other device.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|The tracks have no distortion, skipping, or  anything else that may reduce your listening experience. Is  it exactly how it should be.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read a lot of Stephen King. Some of his books, like \\"It,\\" I just loved.  Others, like \\"Under The Dome,\\" greatly disappointed me. This book is a real page-turner (it's a great premise - if you could go back in time, could you, would you, stop Kennedy's assassination).  I am three quarters through it and can't wait to find out the ending.  I hope I'm not disappointed.<br /><br />I am adding this because I have just finished reading it and found the climax so exciting, that I could not stop.  Often I am enthralled with a story, only to be disappointed in the ending.  I have to say that Stephen King ended this story with intelligence and style.  Completely satisfying!  And I love the last words of the \\"Afterword\\" giving credit to Jack Finney's great time travel novel, \\"Time And Again.\\"
B002VPE1X4|5.0|This is a good case for carrying small compact digital cameras.But you might want to keep it inside your big bag.There is no zipper so you may like it , or you may not like it,The fabric is soft & feels good.I am happy with the purchase.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Not as full featured as the computer version, but it is pretty much all you need if you want a quick glance at the immediate future weather.
B0028RXXE8|4.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift and have heard it's much enjoyed.  I may get a set for myself!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this.  It is just as good as the one on my IPod Touch.  Good resposiveness to touch, has &#34;undo&#34; tab, which is great, and I don't mind the ads.  Unlike the other reviewer, I did not get these ads popping up in other places.  I play this all the time.
B007IK44CK|5.0|I liked this one better than the others.  I thought the ending was pretty cool.  I would recommend this movie to friends.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really liked the book. Couldnt put it down. Although storyline is very much like the Anna Quindlan book Black and Blue. Both books are excellent.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I do love my pinterest for great ideas and creative things to try. Has so much to look at every day! The only thing I don't like about the app (or I guess it's just because the kindle doesn't) but the picture doesn't fill the screen you have to scroll up and down to see the whole thing. If I could find a way for the Kindle fire to rotate the screen up and down and not horizontally, this app would be so much better to view. But other than that, I have no issues with it. Great for the creative person or for anyone looking for decorating tips, recipies, photography tips, etc. It has everything!
B007M45PMU|5.0|As is the case with most people, the lumineers' single 'Ho Hey' was what initially sparked my interest in them. It instantly became my favorite song, so I decided to give the rest of the album a try. I was not disappointed. The album definitely fits into the folk music genre, with some songs sounding very 'country', but I liked every single one (I'm typically inclined toward rock/alternative music). Many if not all of the songs sound deep and heartfelt, and some are very sad. This is one of my favorite albums.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is so much fun. Hard to put it down. I really like it and although I don't have facebook, you can still do things in the fame without it, just takes a little longer to complete the tasks. So much fun and highly addicting! Would recommend it to anyone of any age.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I really love this album, even though I could do without one or two of the songs. None of the tracks are bad, but some are a bit...&#34;meh&#34;. That's the reason I would actually only give this album 4.5 stars (amazon is only allowing 1-star increments). That being said, the songs that are good are really, really good. Imagine Dragons is my new favorite band.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Even if you don't agree with everything in this book, there is enough science to make you re-think what you know about running. Worth it!
B000SEIDR0|5.0|A very good link from just eating unconsciously to an understanding of the chain of mutual sustenance. Perhaps a good followup reading would be J.G. Bennett's &#34;The Dramatic Universe.&#34;
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book really had me going from start to finish. It is rare that you feel the emotions of the character but somehow this author really manages to capture the heart of both Sky and Holder. Definitely recommend this book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I picked this because of my Family telling me how great it was and i really enjoy playing it. Each new Goal you try is challenging , yet fun to do... I didn't want to put it down..
B004HD61KE|4.0|My first James Rollins novel and I loved it.  An interesting plot and totally believable.  I look forward to another of his novels.
B00479SVBU|4.0|This is not the highest quality device available in the market but, for the price this thing is sweet and excedes expectations by quite a bit.  It has many great reviews for a reason.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great acting and story lines.  Also good interplay with WWI history.  Beware, you will be hooked and want to watch all of the episodes in one sitting.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was definitely a page turner.<br /><br />It may have been a work of fiction, but there was so much truth in it, these things happen all the time. Teenagers have to deal with so much in their lives, beginning with peer pressure.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to every parent, just be aware of your child's life and what is going on in their world!!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|the product came in fast in service. it was nice a package.<br />it a good product. it was good music.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Every book I read by Nicholas Sparks seems to be better than the one before! I look forward to many more!
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|the product came in fast in service. it was nice a package.<br />it a good product. it was good music.
B004HAEGP4|5.0|i chose this rating simple the movie is awesome in my opinion you got all your action and some serious zombie ass kicking what else could you ask for
B000U0F7RG|5.0|the product came in fast in service. it was nice a package.<br />it a good product. i love it it was beautiful.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Although the last book I enjoyed, [[ASIN:1470000342 Note to Self]] by Valentine deFrancis, was of a different genre, I had no problem immediately slipping into The Racketeer. I had hoped to enjoy this book in one sitting - and was not disappointed!  This book is the reason I read Grisham. If you enjoyed reading his early legal thrillers, I recommend this book - as it has all the elements of those days gone by.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Work well, enjoy it.  Drop the requirement for title and additional words or I will not do any further surveys.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I was in need of a USB connection from my desktop to my printer and this cable is just what I needed. The item works well and shipped very quickly.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|I chose this because my wife and i are flying to New York in May to see Joe at the Beacon, i would recommend this to any music lover.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Tough enough for just about anything you would want to do with a knife.  Thick blade for strength and durability.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|I chose this , because i wanted to look back on joe a bit, i was not surpried to see that i enjoyed this one very much as well.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|OVER THE WKND I SAW THIS MOVIE ON SHOWTIME'S FREE TRIAL SO I HAD TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Better than the first book if the trilogy - Follett got back to good style. Can't wait for the third!!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book was such a good story. It brought tears to my eyes at times. I would suggest it for everyone but mostly teenagers because of the life lessons of dedication and forgiveness it has.
B0001WGIBW|5.0|I first bought Brio train sets 20 years ago for my son, which I still have.  Now I am delighted to know that this high quality product is still available so that I can add onto my son's set and provide creative play for my grandsons.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely loved it.  I can't wait til the next season!  I love the style of that time...it really takes you to another place,
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. My favorite was the bubble bath at the end. This was my first book of the series. I can't wait to read the next one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My friend told me about this book over a year ago, she raved about it, and so I wanted to read it, but didn't have a Kindle, so I let it go.  The months continued by and she would mention there were more of them now, and I should really read it - but I was anti-Kindle, because I like old-fashioned books.  I didn't want an e-book.  I never hop on new technology right away, I like to let them get the kinks out first.  So I held out on WOOL.<br /><br />Then right before Christmas my old phone broke, and I replaced it with an iPhone 3, and found out I could get a kindle app for my phone.  So I bought WOOL as my first ever e-book.  The first VHS I ever bought was &#34;Star Wars&#34;.  The first DVD I ever bought was &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34;.  The first Blu-Ray I ever bought was the &#34;Firefly&#34; series.<br /><br />I'm proud to say that the first e-book I ever bought will live in infamy along with my other 'firsts' of new technology.  It's got that unmistakable sense of something 'really good' when you read it.  And I can't even pin down exactly what it is, but like those other classic works of art I mentioned, it's got that special 'something'.  You experience it, and you know you've got a classic on your hands.  Long live e-books! : )
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This the best series ever hilly recamend getting this book. It's perfect enter tanment happy reading from a reader me.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This season had so many different aspects to it, it made for great television and I was happy it wasn't centered around just one killer like past seasons.  This is my favorite season.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I would recommend it to a friend but it shuts off my kindle a whole bunch of times I HATE the teloporter ssssssoooooo mmmmuucccchhh<br />But overall great game please say my comment helped
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I'm surprised no one has said this yet, but the (free) version of this app on my phone is way better! It offers badges and 5-9 coin words while the Kindle version does not, making the game a lot less fun to play. I spent forever earning enough coins to get bombs on my phone and was excited to finally have a bigger screen to play on, only to be thoroughly disappointed that all I can use my bombs for is to refresh my list of words..which I can already do without wasting bombs by closing out of the game. Really disappointed, planning to delete this app soon :/.
B005NNV044|5.0|I have been listening to this album for over 30 years, especially Echoes.  The remaster has revealed instruments and over all workmanship not previously detected.  The full spectrum and beauty of the piece has been exposed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's so awesome. Just read it. Better than Harry Potter series.<br /><br />By William Bob blah blah blah blah blah blah
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is so well done as to be addictive. The stories and the characters are brought to life so vividly.
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|I liked this movie because it is one to make you think and expand your mind a little.  It is about time travel, you wonder if these things are possible, and wonder about the ending.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Loved the Live Concert in ATX. Had to get the London CD to recapture the moments. Leonard Cohen at his best surrounded by the best.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie had me ready to stomp some mud holes in people.  Wish the real world could work like this.
B005SVVANW|4.0|I loved the design, but the quality of the puzzle itself was sub par. It didn't keep me from enjoying the design, but the tactile pleasure of putting together a quality puzzle was missing.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Christimas gift in 1972. Played every song and loved every song. Wish I could say the same about many an album since that time. Great music, even after all these years.
0545265355|5.0|Got it for my wife for Christmas. Set and case very nice. Box is solid and not cheap. Good price. All well.
0393338827|5.0|I'm half-way through the book, already have my blood boiling. The corruption at the highest levels of our corporations isn't anything new, it's the knowing that our government, now going on five years later, won't pursue criminal charges against any of these lowlifes that's particularly galling.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this sequel<br /> You get to see more of who Christian really is and how he sees himself.<br /><br />A little corny at times with some of the things Ana says in her mind...but who doesn't like a little corn in their lives?<br /><br />Xo
0393327345|4.0|This book is one that you should read if you are interested in the way the mind work, its great, violent at some points, well written and it keeps your attention all the time.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I got this app for my Kindle Fire. I've been a huge fan of ZeptoLab's apps since I bought the original Cut the Rope app. This is another terrific app from them! It's fun and enjoyable to play. Just wish it had more levels!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|So far I'm enjoying the game. Beats boring TV anyways. The safari round ups are fun. Hopefully it wont get old.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This is now officially my favorite Christmas CD - I absolutely love it. Each songer is better than the last one. I especially like the title track.
0312360266|5.0|Love the series tons!! Great story line, well executed, well written, and the proof reader definitely paid attention cuz the were hardly any mistakes!!
1609611543|5.0|A great analysis of modern Wheat and the effects it has on all of us who eat it.  Everyone should read this and take steps to remove wheat from their diet.  There are other grains that can be substituted easily and breads made from them, Spelt for one example.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This app is AHHHMAZZZAYN! I love it. It works great on Kindle Fires. It scares the crap out of me though....but I love it! This games kicks ass!
B008S0IJAM|5.0|Charmer is a typical Aimee Mann album, meaning that it is full of excellent songs that are beautifully played and sung. Aimee is consistently rewarding. Favorites on this one, Slip and Roll, Living a Lie, Barfly, Disappeared. The others have their charms as well (sorry 'bout that), although Gamma Ray is closer the Superball end of the spectrum. As a whole, however, this is another five star addition to Aimee's catalogue.
B004GYY714|5.0|I really really love it I can hear my favorite music and the sound is awsome now that is all my entretaiment during my work around the house......:D !!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get this game it is so worth it but they should get an  update for flint and steel in creative
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Cool little game. its basically turn by turn game play mixed with a little tower defense-esque game style. Try it. You'll get a few enjoyable days worth out of it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I heard about this on npr and got it right away...wonderful get it and pass it on to a friend
B0061S0A64|3.0|Its a cool little app, for about 3 mins. Then I got over it and deleted it. Kids may find it amusing though. try it
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|I really like the series of movies. Much better than some other versions of the Batman story. I really like many of the actors.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|There's better battery apps out there. I deleted it pretty soon after. Nothing distinguishably bad, just doesn't stand out among the sea of battery apps.
6305428042|5.0|Bette Midler is outrageous and so funny! Great movie for laughs and not too frightening for the kiddies to watch.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|This is my favorite by Yo-Yo Ma.  I put this on when i am ready to go to sleep. I love it.
B0098460O4|5.0|Just love these two beautiful voices together!<br /><br />Hope the next album is more towards American songs.<br /><br />Can't wait to hear more from them!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Very good book, still reading it.  Wonderful that Amazon offered this free. i love reading on the kindle app on my ipad.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I have  read through chapter 5 and nothing steamy or tantilizing yet.  I've put the book away for now.  Maybe one day I'll pick it up to read again or maybe I won't.
1452110581|2.0|if you like 'honey boo boo' you might like this book.  6th grade mentality.  bought it because i thought it would be a 'cute' gift for a cat lover.  very disappointed!!!!
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|This game isn't too bad.  Provided me with about 10 min of entertainment till I got stuck and needed a break. But I'll be back knowing that there are over 100 levels that get trickier as you move along.  Interesting concept and guess what you don't have to spend money to keep playing like most other games.  The game has decent graphics and lost of fun creatures to contend with it appears.  Not sure if I would have paid but as a faotd it's worth the download.
B0002IQOZA|5.0|I love Christina Aguilera and I love this CD. I got a good price because this CD was released quite some time ago, but I still enjoy any of Christina's music.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Me ha llegado de buena manera el producto; felicito al vendedor por este producto que me ha llegado de buena manera.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone!  While I thought the start was ever so slightly slow once I got into it I couldn't put it down.  Absolutely fabulous book - unputdownable!
B0063IH60K|2.0|Just dealing the cards, an ad pops up either for another game or something like match.com ad, and recently I've been getting video commercials!  It's ridiculous just to play a game!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Very Enjoyable, Actors do an excellent job, I've enjoyed it for many years and wanted to add it to my collection.  Graphics and HD effects do an excellent job.
0307592731|5.0|This is essentially a memoir that reads more like a literary novel.  I bought it because I can see myself doing a solo outdoor adventure trip someday and was interested in getting female's perspective.  A woman's outdoor adventure story this book definitely is, but it is so much more.  It is also a story about the fallibility of humankind, self-acceptance, redemption, the ups and downs of family relationships, and grief and acceptance of loss.  If this weren't enough, the author is one of the finest writer's I have ever read, though the writing was exceptional in the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the book, but weakened somewhat towards the end.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|Very Enjoyable, Good British humor, Actors do an excellent job, I've enjoyed it for many years and wanted to add it to my collection.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|I gave the case to a friend who had a kindle because it was too small for my kindle fire.
B0000844I8|5.0|Very Enjoyable, Actors do an excellent job, I've enjoyed it for many years and wanted to add it to my collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is cool ecspecially on a kindle fire cause its bigger than a ipod screen cooooooooool coooooooool hay hay go temple run
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Very Enjoyable, Harrison Ford does an excellent job, I've enjoyed it for many years and wanted to add it to my collection.
B008G12ERC|4.0|So, i've listened to the entire cd 3 times already. I have to say, I like it!! I felt like the other CDs were more like \\"rock opera\\" and this cd has more of a \\"typical rock\\" sound. It doesn't mean its bad, it's just not what i was expecting!<br /><br />If you like Muse, you will like this CD! It's easy to listen to and enjoy!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Very Enjoyable, Good British humor, Actors do an excellent job, I've enjoyed it for many years and wanted to add it to my collection.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a great little tool.  I bought it to sharpen hunting knives but now it is in my kitchen drawer with my kitchen knives.  I use this to put the edge back on the knives and then hit them with the steel to finish them.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|Being a fan, I do not find not much new exposure of Michale's life and legacy in this book,  However, the author has certainly brought up numerous points and supporting to clarify the situations and issues with Michael in particular to all theose false allegations.<br />I would recommend the reading of this book to learn more about Michael.  It is time to find out the truth in all the matters instead of taking in whatever the tabloids have been making up when he was in life or even up to now.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|One of the stickiest books we have ever had the pleasure of reading! We love the ideas presented in the book and the simple way they are conveyed.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It's such a good romance novel like Nicholas Sparks normally writes, but the suspense separates it from all the rest! I just had to keep reading because I just had to know what was going to happen!!<br /><br />A must read!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Other reviewers have provided a synopsis of this book, but I have to chime in to say that it is one of the best hard SF books I've read in quite a while.<br /><br />The story of a sort of Martian Robinson Crusoe, all alone trying to survive in a indifferent and extremely hostile environment is gripping stuff. There is little \\"action\\". Things happen slowly with ocassionaly moments of excitement/terror when things rapidly go wrong. Yet the tension builds and the solutions to the problems are both innovative technically and demonstrative of a straightforward engineering and scientific approach to problem solving.<br /><br />The character simply doesn't give up. He demonstrates resiliance and good humour throughout. It's the sort of story that would, in real life, glue people to their screens every day looking for updates. The main character is both likeable and engaging, with a sense of humour and independance that is refreshing to find in any book.<br /><br />Working in the space industry I have met these people and been in meetings where similar attitudes are demonstrated. It rings very, very true and is a testament to an author who either has personal experience in the space indsutry or has done an admirable amount of research and then managed to write all of those characters & situations accurately and in a way that draws you into the story.<br /><br />Very, very well done. Highly recommended to hard SF fans.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's not my favorite book in the series, as I feel the that ending leaves the reader lacking some, but I loved the series and still enjoyed the final book.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I love this chess program for myself, but I think every chess program should have a super-easy level for little kids, which plays randomly, or even plays to lose.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|This movie has great animation and cute, but predictable story line.  Just another glossy kids movie.  I give it three stars.  It passed the time.
098478280X|5.0|I used this book to prepare for a string of job interviews. I ended up with multiple offers, and I thought I should probably buy the book that helped me prepare.
B000HEWHAU|5.0|Case and DVD in perfect shape. I've seen this movie about 7 times! Love it! It always makes me think, trying to figure out how it's possible. I could watch it and then watch it again the next day!
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Built-in file managers can't do much. If you want to do anything remotely complicated with files, get this. Very nice.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I think, this book like miracle. Mr.King again draw for us unbelievable story about usual man in unusual situation.<br />I recommend this book as another fine example of a talented Writer.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I really don't understand why there aren't more toys like this. I don't think you can get a more engaging and fun toy concept - there ought to be a thousand flavors of this toy.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I rarely want to re-read a book or see a movie a second time. My first comment after viewing this film was that I'd like to watch it again - immediately!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Enjoyed having a teen movie night with my daughters, enjoyed it so much watched it again the following night :)
B0031RSBU0|5.0|I am a huge Mankell and Kurt Wallander fan. I have read all the novels and am just sad that they are over! A must read, quintessential Mankell.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|its a great game and i love all the games you have<br />keep up the good work that all ty
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I picked up this novel, though controversial, on a vacation. It takes time to get used to it, in the first novel. But a nice love story despite the rest.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|The lyrics are excellent and this album is perfect for a commute. It's great to sing to and it's great to listen to, and the tempo doesn't inspire any road rage ;)  I'm looking forward to their next release whenever that may be.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I understand bad things happen to people, and regrettably even to innocent children so that's not the problem with this book. It's so sad that so many bad things envelope these two young people. I must admit this book brought about sorrow and happiness within me. What I had trouble grasping was the maturity and grace that sky and holder portrayed during the cluster f*** of everything that had happened to them.  Even Very emotionally stable adults wouldn't have been able to handle this situation the way they did; this really boggled me. It was just completely unrealistic how the book portrayed them handling these beyond heavy situations.
B008K7RGA2|4.0|I have seen many Tosca productions and performed in a couple myself. This production, generally, is very good. The set design and consumes are classic and the lighting evokes the dark tones of the story even in the lighter moments. The atmosphere is heavy and oppressive as would be expected for Rome in thatbera. Tosca's constumes resemble those often seen in productions of &#34; War and Peace&#34; on film and the costumes of the men could apply to multiple eras.<br /><br />Vocally, this is a mixed bag. Angela Gheorghiu has never been my favorite soprano. She is often harsh in her register transitions and her color is sometime smokey. But here, she seems well suited for the role in this size theater. Her register passagioes work for the anxiety of the jealous woman, and her sometime stiff presentation complements the narsicistic nature of the street singer. She handles &#34;Vissi d'arte&#34; very well and her  posing of Scarpia's body in act two is done with real grace adding to the chilling effect of the scene.  All in all, she is a pleasant surprise in this performance.<br /><br />Jonas Kaufmann is a lyric spinto tenor with a baritonal tone in the mid range. Though his voice sounds like a baritone, the center of his tessitura is definately tenor. Where he lacks the Italianate ping or squillo, he generates enough power that he easily matches Tosca in the duets. Often, Tosca overpowers her Mario particularly in the first act duet. With Kaufmann, this is not a problem. His characterization is good, and he is able to match the phrasing with the necessary color for each of the scenes.  However, this is not an Italian Cavaradossi. The sound of the voice does not have the basic passion of a Coreli or the vulnerability of a Bergonzi. Yet in the context of this size of the hall his performance works.<br /><br />Bryn Terfel is a bass-baritone with an exquisite voice. But for Scarpia, his voice is not quite up to the job. The role of Scarpia is written for a true baritone with a large and brilliant top range.  Terfel has a smoothe voice with very little ring on top, and his ability to sing above an F-sharp is limited. His medium weight sound  is almost lost in his second act cavatina and his high G's have very little spin.  The voice is just not heavy enough for the role.  Dramatically his performance is a different story. He is marvelous in demonstrating the controlled malelevence of the man. Watching him closely, one sees the little things that illistrate the selfish passion he has for Tosca in act one and the self-satisfied gloat of victory in act two just before his death. This makes the surprise of Tosca's murdering all the more effective. He is almost Gobbi-like in his final moments.<br /><br />Conductor Antonio Pappano gives a standard reading of the score, but he works well with the singers, even covering a faux pas by Terfel in act two. He gives his singers room to breath and seems to feel when they need support. The ensemble works well here.<br /><br />This is a good performance. Not the best. But it catches the flavor and tone of the of the libretto and the very dark nature of the story. This is a keeper.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game, many turns, Jumps, slides. You must be super fast the loner you run. Turns, jumps, slides are. Subject to change at any second when you get further into the game.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The author experienced a great deal of illness that took him on a trip to Heaven.  I felt that the book was really more about his illness and personal history/life than about Heaven itself.  Although he is certain he visited Heaven, his descriptions were not very long or detailed.  I am sure it would be difficult to describe, and he did make it sound mysterious and ethereal.  The author, being a person with a scientific background, tries to present Heaven in a logical, rather scientific way.  He evidently was not a very 'religious' man.  The other book that I read about a visit in Heaven was written by a man who was.  It was rewarding to me, that they both were overwhelmed by the feeling of love!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Simple to use, settings understandable!  I set a new alarm, found  Eva cassidy singing Over The Rainbow in music I had downloaded, selected that as my alarm, hit the save button and put the HD to sleep with the top tab.  Using no power chord it rested the night and awakened me with the Songbird herself starting my day.  Checked battery consumed and it was negligible, I put unit in (airplane) mode during the night and alarm worked fine.  Using Pandora as a music feed would require wifi all night and depending on how much stuff you have checking in and out power consumption would vary widely!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is quick, yet surprisingly complex read. It is a story which causes the reader to look inward for answers to questions surrounding mortality, love, and survival. Collins does a wonderful job of building an environment that is familiar to the reader, yet leaves a part of it for our imagination. I recommend this book to all and encourage those who have read the book to continue discussing it with their peers.

B002AWX6UM|5.0|This book is hard to put down. The way Beah tells the story you can see everything he saw. You get a glimpse of a world far beyond anything you've ever imagined.
0446547654|5.0|He is my absolute favorite Author. I anxiously await his new releases and he never disappoints me. Beautiful story, nice little twist
B000FC13Y0|5.0|This is the fourth book that I have read from Neil Gaiman. He is an incredible writer. I am so amazed at how beautifully visual his worlds of fantasy can be. Great read. Highly recommend.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|This movie is probably one of the best stories I have ever seen. I can't watch it too much because its not that type if movie for me but I think it's powerful!
B000NIVJGI|4.0|It's a classic movie and this is by far the best place to find movies like this one!!! just perfect!
B002ZG9968|5.0|I really liked this movie and I have watched it too many times to count still makes me LOL. JLo is a great romcom actress

B00A9X9TIW|5.0|it was entertaining throughout.  it's hard for me to sit through a movie but i really liked this one. k
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|I never watched SATC until I saw the first movie then went out and got all the seasons I was so happy when I found out there would be a second film and really liked it!!!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|i really liked this movie and usually cannot stand western type movies.  highly recommended!  the acting was very good as well
B00992CF6W|4.0|I would rate this a full 5 stars but there is one thing that I want. Add Bluetooth so when we are on the go we can hook up with other devices without wifi
B009NQKXYK|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was very entertaining!  The graphics in it were amazing and the acting was pretty good.  Keeps you guessing!
0439023521|5.0|I bought this book as a gift and the person loved it!<br />I don't know what else to say because I didn't read it myself.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|With all the crap shows on TV right now (ahem..Honey Boo Boo) It's so refeshing to have a show that is not only wonderfuly produced but has tallented writers. This show is really funny. I'm not a person that cries during movies or gets all emotional when watching TV, but this show has me laughing so hard that I did start to cry. Great cast and great storyline. A must watch!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This stylus is so nice when I use it for my Dell 7 inch tablet. I use it for games, so it has certainly increased my speed. I like the fact that it has different size tips too. I have a Dell 7 inch tablet, my daughter has a HKC 7 inch tablet, and my son has another brand that he bought at Walmart, and this stylus works very well on all three tablets, so it's not just for the Kindle Fire. My son also used it on his iphone, and it works great on that as well. He just has to use the smaller tip. Great product!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not a huge tv watcher but this entire series captivated me. I watched all 3 seasons over a 3 day weekend.<br /><br />Sad actually but the series is very entertaining.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|I was reading it while traveling. Could hardly wait to return to it at night. Was glad that I guessed the wrong ending and yet found the real &#34;bad guy&#34; not believable.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|On the movie:<br /><br />Need I add anything more to the countless rave reviews? Before I actually watched it, I had my doubts. Superhero movies are fun, but putting multiple superheroes together in one movie? That could turn out really cheesy and choatic, no? But Joss Whedon and the actors proved me wrong. It works--in the most epic way. How I regret not seeing this in the theater. I'm not a DVD/bluray collector, but this one may just be the one that will make me start being one.<br /><br />On the video quality of Amazon instant streaming:<br /><br />It ain't that great. I watched in SD on Macbook Pro, and it wasn't that clear. I could still enjoy the movie relatively undisturbed about the video quality. If you own a device compatible with Amazon's HD service, though, I'd recommend watching it in HD. It's only $1 difference when you rent, anyway.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is actually amazing, it took me a while to find a good horse game and now I have.I love it.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|i love this game BUT there's no garden, half the mini games are missing!!! extremely dissapointed. i thought paying for an app would get me the full game.
B0035FQ1UU|5.0|I loved this movie, it was very stimulating and action packed. I would share with all my friends, and have.
B004NDVK1I|4.0|I've heard cuts from this over the years and finally bought it... very cool.  Sound quality (vocal) could be better but that's not why you pick this kind of album up
B002NHIJTW|5.0|I love this series, I just can't get enough. The people, the action... the smexy vampire brothers fighting over the same chic.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is just one of those books you just cant put down. I highly recommend reading this one. Just Perfect!

0765325950|4.0|The last battle has begun - there is fighting on four fronts - lead by the great generals.  It is mankinds' last stand, they must hold while The Dragon Reborn goes to Shayol Ghul to battle the Dark Lord.  So comes the final chapter in the Wheel of Time series.  A series that has spanned two decades and two authors.<br /><br />It should come as no surprise that this final book, A Memory of Light, spends the majority of time on the Last Battle.  Many of the characters who had \\"screen time\\" in the series make an appearance; some only slightly (mainly in order to resolve their plot thread).  All of the major characters have something to contribute.  Having so much to resolve in the final book makes for a sometimes uneven read.  Sanderson has been accused in the past of wrapping some things up a little too neatly (quickly?) but left with the scope of the story needing completion at the time of Jordan's death, I think he did an exceptional job, especially for taking over the reins of someone elses creation.<br /><br />Some of our beloved characters will die, some of those we hated will get off too lightly and even a child can become a hero of legend.  Not everything will be tied up in a neat package and a lot will be left to our imaginations and each of us, in our oun way, will be able to complete the story ourselves.  One has to wonder, if Jordan had lived, would things have turned out differently?  Would the series have ever ended?  I always felt Jordan's love of this story and his characters in the minute detail he provided.  While many readers complained of that, and I at times certainly agreed, now that the story has come to an end, I find I will miss knowing more about my old friends. After all, I have been on this journey with them for the last 20+ years.<br /><br />Would I recommend this series?  Definitely.  For any new readers coming to the world of \\"The Wheel of Time\\" they will have the luxury of starting a completed series.  Will I reread the series?  Definitely.  These characters have become a part of my imagination and I, for one, am not ready to let them go.<br /><br />Thanks to Harriet McDougal and Brandon Sanderson for seeing to the completion of The Wheel of Time.ly.  These characters have become a part of my imagination and I, for one, am not ready to let them go.<br /><br />Thanks to Harriet McDougal and Brandon Sanderson for seeing to the completion of The Wheel of Time.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|I was laughing through the entire movie, I love a good comedy. My daughter loves to watch it repeatedly too.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Bought this CD for a Christmas gift for my mother. Grew up with my mom listening to Bonnie Raitt. It came in time for christmas and still wrapped in plastic. She says she LOVES it!

B0084B5TK8|5.0|Couldn't put it down, thought it didn't date a bit cant recommend enough, if you haven't read it, Read it now!!!!
B00336C3EY|3.0|It's an ok movie, but it's very dry in several places. I wasn't able to watch it more then once.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I thought it was great not even dated .... by-the-by.<br />I will recommend it to all my friends, it is a classic!!!
B0042K6G6Q|5.0|I love this series, I just can't get enough. The people, the action... the smexy vampire brothers fighting over the same chic.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Loved it, never read it before and was well worth the read, another classic, no wonder but it can stand the test of time
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I was skeptical at first when I started to read this book, since it is a translation.  After the first few pages, I got hooked.  Never saw the play or movie..and I keep wondering how they were able to make a musical out of this book.  The book has a lot of philosophical thoughts and conversations.  A great book to keep you thinking between reads. Great for all ages (as long as you understand some of the language....that is what 's great about a digital copy...you can query the meanings).  I also love the detail that the author goes into describing the places, the people in the book....very eloquent.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This book is one of the Best books I have read in My entire life<br />This book is Worth Every penny
1611761069|5.0|My most favorite author ..enjoyed the book immensely can't wait for her next book.  I must read for her fans.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book is OK but it is a little boring. It needs to be a little more humorous so people like it!
B007DIQC90|4.0|Very good album. Good music. Good band. The trumpet they used in their band make the songs so much better.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I hate the ending I think there had to be something else. No-one deserves to spend the rest of  their lives that miserable.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This is a very functional case. The device is easy to place or remove. The Kindle is held firmly in place. The Kindle can be placed at a variety of angles when in landscape orientation. It stays in place and does not slip. When in portrait orientation, the cover opens to the right, not to the left, as a book cover does. Also, the cover must be open in order to connect the charger. This are very minor issues and I still recommend this cover over the Amazon cover which seems less sturdy.<br />I purchased the orange case and it's a subtle &#34;burnt&#34; orange. Very attractive.
1936891026|4.0|This book is a splendid trove of observational tidbits about the forces which impact peoples' personalities, particularly when it comes to being motivated.  Broken into three easy-to-read sections, the author uses a fabulous range of vocabulary as he shares his insights about \\"Resistance\\", the clever antagonist which strives to keep people from achieving what they were put on Earth to achieve.<br /><br />He shares his personal stories about times of strife as a writer in an open and inviting manner.<br /><br />This book does not offer an \\"action plan\\", as many other self-help books do.  Instead, it offers guidance and promotes self-reflection to take a look in the mirror- where you will undoubtedly see... the face of \\"Resistance\\".
B008DYZKQE|5.0|My son loves it<br />lovelly story and breast price . was great to be able to transfer it directly to my tablet
0920668372|5.0|I keep these books in stock to give to my pregnant friends and co-workers (and sometimes delivery people, others that I don't really know but run across).  I always tell them not to read without a box of Kleenex handy.  I absolutely love it.  Last year for Christmas, my daughter and grandson gave me the recordable version.  His voice has now changed and it is so sweet to listen to his child voice reading it to me.  I highly, highly recommend this book. Recently gave it to a newly expectant father.  He was delighted as he remembered this from childhood.  Personally, I don't think it's a children's book but his and his wife's memories of it were good ones.<br /><br />I can't say enough good about this book.
B004UJ81IA|4.0|One of the forerunners of travel books, but Robert Louis Stevenson is best known as a cracking adventure author of his time (Treasure Island, Kidnapped, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and so on, all written in the 1880s).  He is also the author of A Child's Garden of Verses, some poems of which I can still recite 60 years away from my memories of childhood.<br /><br />This is his best known travel book and it is redolent of  late 19th century values - a fascinating read.<br />As another 19th century travel classic I would recommend George Borrow's Wild Wales.<br /><br />For other 19th century cracking adventure novels may I recommend H. Rider Haggard (King Solomon's Mines, She, Allan Quatermain and so on). And into the 20th century John Buchan (the Thirty Nine Steps and other Richard Hannay novels) . These guys really knew how to write exciting stuff but they are largely forgotten these days.  They were the Stephen Kings of their day.  Personally among today's authors I read and reread Robert Goddard.
B0086700CM|3.0|tried it because my friends have it but just not interested.  I have removed it from my kindle already. free
B004LAIU4I|5.0|This is a wonderful & thoughtful album from Paul Simon.  It has been compared to his earlier album Graceland.  I concur with that. I loved that he went to South Africa & did a concert at the time that album was released.  I wonder if he will do the same with this one.  Each track is a gem to treasure. My favorite is 'Afterlife'.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. U dont need facebook, and you can chat with others. The game is compeitive and any age group can play.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Very good program and it will come in handy for storing pictures in the future. Thanks very much for sending this information to me
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I would recommend this item to anyone who liked the Aliens movies.  It's been awhile since I saw the original movie, and it was fun to watch all the movies with my son during holiday break.  The packaging is great and the movies are still enjoyable to watch.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I have it on my PC, Phone and now Kindle. It is great when you need to read documents or download books.
B00838HRP2|1.0|Bought this as a gift for my niece and won't play in many types of DVD players. Might be burned copy from original?
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Was so happy to find this on dvd.  This is a must for Christmas.  Sadly, they are not showing these old movies on tv anymore and this is a gem for the season.  This and &#34; A Christmas Carol&#34; with Alastair Sim,  make Christmas old fashioned.. Purchased both movies through the same company and they came quickly and packaged well..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like to play it on my friends ipad I think it is awesome<br />I think it is better on his iphone4s
B004GJYRFA|5.0|We first watched Everwood when it premiered on tv.  I was glad to find it.  With so much violence on tv, it is nice to find series you can watch that are uplifting and clean.  Very glad to find it on dvd.  Good acting all around.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|slow and tedious units come slow and weak gameplay simplistic and cityvillish next time I will pay for a good game thanks for the ear
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I didn't want to put the book down.  I would recommend to anyone. It's well written and holds the readers attention.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I don't understand why I read so many ridiculous reviews about this thing. Buttons are hard to press, buttons are too big, etc. They must not have arms or something if they can't use this product. It's pretty awesome, I think.
B001L5VYFI|3.0|Good album. They do most of the classics, but everybody's voices get pretty tired by the time they get to Carry On.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Excellent story that was unique and very interesting.  I recommend this book but do not recommend the following books in the series.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have used this app on my laptop computer and it has always worked well. It also works well on my Kindle Fire HD
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I listened to some people talk about this at a party ( I had already read it)  They didnt seem to get the allegory.  If you are closed  minded and not interested in learning and looking at things from a different perspective, dont buy this.  But i you are open and want to get to the root of where some of your issues come from and how to banish them by practising the Four agreements.  Buy this.  I still am working on the practie them in your life part.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|These are the best movies ever. The fourth is alright. I would have given it 5 stars but all four movies are on two discs. One movie on each side. Kind of annoying when they do it that way but I guess that's how they can make it so cheap.
1416511946|5.0|I would recommend this book to any and everyone. The way he lets you glimpse into what his life was like back then...much respect Nikki.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Really great book about overcoming fear. At times we all may feel different and left out, but there are ways to get through it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always played Mahjong but this has different levels that are challenging enough to keep you coming back to play! The large variety of levels in each game sections is awesome...Im still working my way through!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed reading the story and love what Sparks writes about and makes it so suspenseful as well as endearing. Hope the movie doesn't mess the book up!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Crafts, home decor, food, moods, inspiration, patterns, gardening, nature, home remedies...you will find anything and everything here in an instant!
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you are a Batman fan, if you are a Nolan Fan this is for you, the extras of the trilogy are the best, the history of the batmovile, with: Adam West, Tim Burton and even J,Schumacher are so great... full of nostalgia and great moments... the movies in HD are so beautiful... If you like Batman... get this!
0425252868|5.0|This is what happens when you \\"do\\" a WW2 \\"aviation book\\" that concerns specific WW2 ETO aerial combatants the RIGHT way. There's also just enough of each pilot's personal history being told without being overwhelming. In Stigler's  case, what's written about his early life relates directly with his wartime aviation experience. From my friends at VALOR, this first edition hardcover (with its superb signed bookplate) arrived yesterday afternoon! Yes, Franz Stigler had some problems when he was in North Africa, but this issue of a lack of credibility is addressed in an entire chapter within this book. There were just too many witness's to Brown and Stigler's air combat experience the day Stigler escorted Brown's B-17, but you read it and be the judge. Adam, enjoy your well deserved success with this book in good health!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book in an afternoon...I just couldn't put it down!  Who wouldn't want a TRAVIS in their life?
B005T87QCI|4.0|This game is fun and addicting at first, but after you beat the game, you don't really get on the app at all anymore. At least that's how it is for me but you might be different. This game has awesome graphics and the controls are easy to use, but I recommend that it's better not to get it. I wish they would put more robots and levels on here so then I could rate it 5 stars.
B00AECDDYY|3.0|Seems interesting so far, looking for something different, this seems to fit the bill, I would really like to find another five star game, but they are so rare.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|Our kids love playing this app on our iphones so we purchased it for them to play on their Nabi 2's.  The app won't function beyond the title page.  Big disappointment.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy is fantastic !  I've never been a major reader but I would and have recommended these books to everyone I know . Love them !!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was hooked from the beginning. An interesting plot, great character development, beautiful love story. Surprising plot twists. Highly recommend for ages 15 and up.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Fans of Perfect Chemistry will love this book. I read it after a friend spoke highly of it and wasn't disappointed with what I found. Fantastic and heartwarming!
B00A8SPNYW|2.0|Overly long intro and insufficient instructions hamper what could be an interesting game. However, it freezes at Level 3 everytime. (Samsung Galaxy SII Epic 4G).<br /><br />First four reviews clearly written by developer make me more dubious about the game. {Hint to Developer(s): Don't use the same speech patterns and descriptive phrases in each review. And don't post about the great gameplay for it being FAOTD when it was debuted only 5-10 minutes before the review is posted.}
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wanted to read a good comedy. It was all that I wanted. Down to earth. Very believable..Waking Up Married, I would recommend.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Affleck gets better and better.  Non-stop, believable action and wonderful character portrayal.  I've come to expect on the best from him.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Who Am I? - The Trial. Come on. Seriously? That is the best song in the entire musical and movie. And they left it out. Very disappointed.<br /><br />But what are you going to do? This is the soundtrack. You get what you get.
B000E1NWJQ|5.0|Not much to report, just a great recording of great music, played by a great orchestra. Buy this and enjoy.
B00005JLZN|5.0|We got it quickly & in xllnt condition ~ Love this movie with all of the twists & turns! I would recommend it ~
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|We can watch this over and over. Great buy too. I really hope that this franchise continues to make movies of this and the Part I quality.
B0096DZKZC|3.0|The game itself is fun as are all Sonic games. The \\"touch\\" controls take a bit of getting used to after playing Sonic for years with a console controller. The issue is with the file size of the game. I had to remove most of my games to create sufficient space on my Kindle for this game.If you have room, though you will be satisfied with this game.
1568363931|5.0|loved the book gots over 50 food recipes and shows what to do... also has variation recipes so your not eating the same type of recpie every day! wonderful book to get not just for japanese or chiese but for everyone!

B000FCKGPC|5.0|Although it drags at times, this book stands tall as a triumphant entry into the song of fire and ice series.
B003B02O14|4.0|Again John Grisham excels.  A fun and intelligent plot which grips the reader throughout.  To say the least, an intersting finale.
B004U52VPS|5.0|our son loves playing it, real life angry birds. and he likes creating his own set ups to knock down.
1451627297|5.0|The novel 11/22/63 kept my interest throughout with an intriguing mixture of history, romance, and time travel.  The suspense was constant.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|This movie had me hooked from the first scene.  It's action packed and has a fascinating storyline.  It leaves with a perfect set up for a sequel.  I loved the development of the characters and not knowing what was next!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Awesome for anybody looking to laugh hard! A bunch of nerds butting heads and making fun of each other. A must see!
B00AWTTUHI|3.0|These adult themed batman is better than I expected, you get a really strong hint of realism and dark drama
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Awesome for anybody looking to laugh hard! A bunch of nerds butting heads and making fun of each other. A must see!
B00577WFFE|5.0|Great music however, this CD has all the same songs as MAYHEM by Imelda May, it simply has 5 new songs on it that the earlier released CD of &#34;Mayhem&#34; has. If you are going to spend the money, just get More Mayhem.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great read - mature material written in a way that doesn't overwhelm the reader while maintaining a natural innocence .
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I really enjoy how the author writes.  She keeps me entertained and it flows nicely, plus I don't hate the main character.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing!! From beginning to the end this spicy comedic romance had me on the edge of my seat! What a few great book!

B00ATPVA78|4.0|I decided to give this game a try. I truly enjoyed playing it! I recommend it to all! You will like it too!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As a guy reading  a romance story, this one really keeps your attention.  The evolution of the relationship is interesting to follow, considering how messed up Grey is and how innocent Ana is. The intrigue that is Jack Hyde just adds a sinister thread that runs through books two and three.<br />The psychology behind what makes Grey the way he is is just fascinating.  The way this is developed in the story really lets the reader see inside a messed up man's head and then how he feels about Ana brings him face to face  with  the consequences of his lifestyle.  Ana's evolution from a total innocent to both the calm influence and the complete frustration of a screwed-up manic control freak like Grey.  Her last name, Steele, is a clever play on words when it comes to the way she stands up to Grey.  I think it is a good commentary on the way women have learned to assert themselves when a relationship is on the line.<br />The sex certainly brings a little spice and, after thinking about it for a minute or two, a little horrified understanding of just how messed up this guy is!  The fact that the story takes place in one of the  most beautiful places on earth just makes it  more fun to read.  The references to some very good music helps too.  Enjoy it too!!
0765325950|3.0|If it's possible for a 900 page book to feel rushed, then A Memory of Light is the book to do it.  I know it seems funny to talk about a Wheel of Time book being rushed after the glacial pace that some of the later Robert Jordan era books moved at, but in A Memory of Light, some important events are completely glossed over, and some are skipped or ignored entirely.  It really feels like there should have been four Brandon Sanderson books instead of three, but I suppose a lot of stuff was likely missing from the notes, and they wanted to keep the amount of material Brandon had to make up to a minimum.  Still, it would have been nice if there was a little more post-last battle content in the book.

0062183591|5.0|The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone---Especially Ourselves is the second book that I've read by Dan Ariely, and it's similarly enlightening.<br /><br />The main focus of this book -- as you can see from the title -- is dishonesty, an area which Ariely has been exploring for several years. I'm guessing that this line of research grew out of his broader interest in the difference between how we behave (revealed preference, or RP) what we profess (stated preference, or SP). This research agenda is similar to mine, as RP-SP divergences loom large in many water sector topics (everything from environmental flows to human rights). Most of those topics are interesting because success and failure depend on decisions made by people who have the freedom to favor themselves over those who depend on them (I explore this \\"principal-agent problem\\" in my research).<br /><br />But Dan states his purpose differently, i.e., he proposes to explain why we are not often dishonest in terms of a rational calculation of costs and benefits (as the economist Gary Becker proposed) but in terms of continuous small fudges made by many people. The socially-relevant dimension of dishonesty, in other words, is not about car thieves and purse snatchers but people taking pencils from the office or stock brokers thinking their fees are justified. The enemy, in other words, is us -- or as he states on page 22:<br /><br />  Essentially, we cheat up to the level that allows us to retain our self-image as reasonably honest individuals.<br /><br />From these words, you may be able to guess that this book explores how we create our self-image and how to change our perception of it.*<br /><br />So that's a LOT of context and summary. Here are some particular notes:<br /><br />  People will steal more, the more \\"distant\\" the object is from money, i.e., pencils are easier than petty cash and stock options are easier than salary.<br />  People who are given gifts are more likely to \\"objectively\\" favor the person/opinion of the giver. This is relevant to discussion of everything from political lobbying to \\"free samples.\\"<br />  That said, it's not easy to eliminate conflicts of interest without inadvertently increasing other costs (lobbying has SOME use).<br />  We make worse decisions and are less honest when we are tired, hungry, etc.<br />  People who wear counterfeit (to show false prosperity) may also be less honest (theft, infidelity, etc.) and less trusting (thinking that you're the same).<br />  The \\"why-the-hell-not?\\" effect of eating too much after a small lapse in your diet, taking more drugs once you've tried a few or breaking more laws once you've broken one is real and harmful to you and others.<br />  We are more likely to cheat when someone in our social group does. (I read about the \\"culture\\" of cheating years ago, and this finding is similar. We pay attention to social cues.) That said, people in many countries cheat at similar levels in NON-cultural settings; local versions of cheating (infidelity, running red lights, etc.) will still vary.<br />  Ariely (posing as a student) paid for papers from \\"essay mills\\" that were crap. When he complained, they threatened to turn him in for cheating!<br />  People are more dishonest when their cheating can help others. This result has something to do with our ability to rationalize that it's not for us, but them (or our ability to \\"blame them\\" for the cheating).<br />  Most religions have ways to reduce cheating (confession, starting the new year clean, the Haj, etc.) -- and that's no accident.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I give this book FIVE STARS for it's fascinating exploration of how we lie to ourselves (forget rational homo-economicus), the impacts of those lies and how to reduce them. Anyone interested in how humans work with \\"discretion\\" should read this book.<br />==========================<br />* Adam Smith explored \\"fair\\" behavior in his 1759 Theory of Moral Sentiments by consideringhow actions would change if we looked at ourselves from an outsider's perspective (a variation on \\"what would your mother think?\\")how actions would change if we looked at ourselves from an outsider's perspective (a variation on \\"what would your mother think?\\")

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl presents a story of a marriage full of secrets and lies. It unfolds as the husband and wife each tell their own story and the reader doesn't know who is telling the truth. There are twists and surprises that make this a book you'll want to finish and discover outcome.

0451450523|5.0|This book is a masterpiece. My tastes in literature and range from the classics - Tolstoy, Kafka, Dickens, the Brontes, Dumas, to Marquez, Celine, Joyce,Tolkien and many others. Tolkien and Lewis stand as masters of fantasy. This book is equal to any I have ever read. It is mystical and profoundly moving - full of words and magic that wrap themselves around you like a blanket of stars. As in all great works of art - there are deep truths nestled gently, yet powerfully in the story.<br />The writing is brilliant and unlike anyone I have ever read. Beautifully, Mr. Beagle puts words together like the master wordsmith he is. He doesn't write - he weaves.<br /><br />The cartoon film does not even come close to capturing the magnificence of this story.<br /><br />I have read everything he has written, love them all - but for me this will always be the quintessential tale. It breaks my heart and makes me celebrate the wonder of being.

A little of that was necessary to get to know her and understand why she would put herself through this, but I got to where, OK I get it, now back to the main story.  Loved where she threw that boot, ha!

B00AJLHUA8|3.0|Sinister is a 2012 supernatural horror film which I wanted to see originally in theaters but never got a chance to. I think Sinister was good but not great, it had several good scary scenes, which is ultimately what I look for in horror films, and it was also very suspenseful, but ultimately it never really transcended the typical horror formula, it utilized found footage in the form of the tapes depicting the murders of the previous families, and before you discover the film's \\"monster\\", which is a pagan deity called Baghuul,it seems almost like a murder mystery film. Had it not been for the trailers which spoil many scenes in the movie and focus intensely on the Baghuul character I probably wouldn't have known this was even a supernatural horror film. I probably would have thought it was a crime or mystery film, albeit a dark one, but still not horror. The trailer really ruined it for me, and had me believe the film was more focused on Baghuul when in reality it focused much more on Ellison (Ethan Hawke) and his downward spiral to madness, after he knowingly moves his family into a house where the grisly murders took place. The acting was okay, and it was very scary at times, but the film was simply good, not great. Many of the scenes in the film were pointless, corny, or incredibly cliched, such as the creepy child's drawings and the eerie ghost kids. Overall decent, but nothing excellent or unique. The family was at least likeable, especially the father, so you felt bad for what happened to them at the end.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|I liked it, and I've liked all the Twilight movies, including the latest one.  There, I've said it, okay?  :)

B00A8KJN14|4.0|When young Victor Frankenstein's dog is hit by a car and killed, the distraught boy uses his scientific genius to bring Sparky back from the dead. However, havoc is unleashed when Victor's classmates decide to imitate his experiment for their own science project entries, with disastrous results! In the end, will the people of New Holland come to accept Victor's abilities and the monster-pup he has created?<br /><br />2012 was pretty much the year for creepy-themed animated features. We got two stop-motion films, ParaNorman and Frankenweenie, and we also got the computer-animated \\"Hotel Transylvania\\". I wouldn't be surprised if I was forgetting something, too, but let's compare these for a moment. Hotel Transylvania is basically an animated Adam Sandler film, but even as someone who found Sandler's earlier films funny,  I gotta say, I don't think his humor translates as well to animation as HE thinks it does. That leaves the two stop-motion films, and it IS always nice to see anything that isn't computer generated in the animation genre these days. Though, I still wish we'd see more hand-drawn work again. ParaNorman came out a little bit earlier, and I'll be honest, even though I'm a Disney fanatic, I like it better than Frankenweenie in a lot of ways, though Frankenweenie had some really great qualities. Both are visually impressive and nicely stylistic, Frankenweenie with its black and white, Burton designs, and ParaNorman with a look all its own. Both have their humorous side, and both, I would say, have the problem that their adult characters aren't always as good as the kid characters. I particularly disliked the adults in ParaNorman, but I liked the kids better than the Frankenweenie kids. Overall though, the main thing was just that Frankenweenie had me feeling kinda \\"meh\\" the whole time, while I was a bit more enthralled with ParaNorman. This could be because Frankenweenie was a story I already knew from the short, live-action film that was Tim Burton's first live-action work, and which got a lot of airplay on the Disney Channel back in the day. Honestly, the new animated feature, to me, didn't really seem to top the original short. I think that was a big problem I had with it. A lot was added, but it didn't add much to the story itself, in my opinion, which is really just taking a story about a boy's love for his dog and turning it into a Frankenstein parody. On the other hand, ParaNorman was a bit more original, and that counts for a lot, and I found the characters, the kids at least, much easier to like, which is also a big thing. Incidentally, the whole thing with the mayor and his niece in Frakenweenie, that didn't do a thing for me. That seemed totally pointlessly unpleasant. But, don't get me wrong, while I preferred ParaNorman (and that's not to say it was a masterpiece), I still felt Frankenweenie was an enjoyable and visually beautiful film. I just didn't take away anything from the story that I didn't get in a shorter runtime from the original short film, which happily is included on this blu-ray release.<br /><br />As I mentioned, Frankenweenie is visually amazing. The voice acting and animation are excellent. I find it odd that the original parents of Victor weren't brought in to reprise their roles, but then, it's just nice to see (or hear) Martin Short in a movie again. The music and everything else in Frankenweenie were great, but as I said, I felt I had gotten all I needed from the simple story through the short film, and yes, the added stuff was just that, filler, albeit entertaining filler. At times, it was very entertaining filler. Still, I found the characters mostly rather dull(when they weren't just being funny) in Frankenweenie. This doesn't necessarily make the movie drag, but it could have been a lot more fun, even though it had its moments for sure. Now, to compare this to still other creepy-themed animated features of recent years, I honestly haven't gotten to see Corpse Bride yet, though I want to. And, though I recently purchased it, it's been quite a while since I've seen Coraline, so I can't say I remember it well enough. However, one I do remember well (and only recently acquired) is Monster House, which I have to say I really prefer to either of these films! As I said, it's nice to see something other than CGI, but Monster House just had better writing and better characters (though maybe the climax of ParaNorman was better). It's really the movie I'd recommend if someone wanted to see something animated fairly recently that was creepy in tone. Be sure to check it out, but all these films are well worth at least one viewing. In fact, I find them all totally worthy of adding to my collection, though I still need to get a copy of ParaNorman.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray itself, of course it looks and sound perfect, and this one also has some nice bonuses, though I'm still totally puzzled as to why animated films so rarely get director commentaries. The highlight here, of course, is the original short film. Watch it and imagine having seen it BEFORE the full-length version. It hardly seems a remake was worthwhile. It was good enough a a short. Anyway, besides that, there's a great making of documentary, as well as a music video and a look at the touring exhibit of models used during the film. Oh, and did I mention the all new Frankenweenie short? It was cute, anyway, and basically it's an alternate opening. \\"Frankenweenie\\" is definitely not the best animated feature of the year, but it was enjoyable, and I don't think a major Burton fan or animation nut would want to miss it.ant to.

B008IJTFYW|4.0|I really like this app. It does help to relax and go to sleep. I wish it wouldn't turn off when you want to open something else like a book or other app.
0765325950|5.0|Great ending to a great series. Highly recommended. The 3/5 overall rating on here is totally undeserved due to review bombing from before release.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is the first book I have read on a e-reader and I thoroughly enjoyed.  I literally had a hard time wanting to put the book down.  I enjoyed the way the story was told through the voices of the two main characters.  I was slightly disappointed that some characters were not well developed.  While, I wished for a more concrete resolution of the story, the finale probably is the most realistic.
0345541588|5.0|Wow!  Jack Reacher is the best super detective.  Sees people being wronged and does something about it, within his set of ethics.
B00338QENI|3.0|Endlessly boring, depressing as can be, no humor, no joy, not even many glimmers of hope.<br /><br />I do not understand the reviews for this being so positive. I think that hinges solely on the novelty of the story itself. It's a sparkly premise. The story simply does not deliver. It is well-written and informative, but definitely do not pick this up expecting to be entertained in any way.<br /><br />Author also flattens the Lacks family characters into exactly what you would expect when you think of \\"white journalist writing about poor black people.\\"
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I loved Girl Gone so I thought I would try another one of Flynn's books. This was well written and I could not put it down, but wanted to. It was a train wreck and left me feeling extremely disturbed. Maybe it was because I read it after the Newtown, CN massacre. Regardless, it addresses issues that left me feeling depressed and I wish I had never read it.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Husb. and I saw Ted in the theater originally, and we were thrilled when it came out on blu-ray.  It shipped quickly and we had no issues with the disc.
B0093QFM6Y|5.0|I was surprised with Gerard Butler's portrayal of the phantom. I've seen several productions of it in Boston and New York and I find that while the actors who play the phantom are technically great, the phantom is portrayed as more of a monster than a tragic character. Not so here.<br />Musically well done, visually well done. Overall great production.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very quick and fast paced read. Not as much storyline as the first book but sets up the plot for book three.
