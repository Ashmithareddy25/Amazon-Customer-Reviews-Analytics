B009UZBLSG|5.0|I bought the Slimport SP1002 for connecting my LG Nexus 4 to my Samsung TV via HDMI.<br /><br />It works exactly as advertised, it's just plug-and-play, that simple!<br /><br />I found it a little annoying that most apps (including the home-screen) are forced into landscape mode, but ultimately not a problem.<br /><br />Great for streaming videos from Netflix, Google Play Movies, YouTube, or your own home movies!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I tried this on my grandkids' Ipad and was HOOKED! This game is a BLAST! It requires a good deal of skill to unlock the bonus levels, and seems to keep going and going and going. Thanks to whoever came up with this....great fun for kids and adults alike.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Very well written. Kept me wanting more! Can't wait to read the next thriller!! This one I definitely be keeping!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|The early levels are pretty easy, great for kids, but they get harder. I use it to keep my brain awake when pulling 12hr night shifts.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|a bit disappointed.  Story seem to be dragged and didn't have the same appeal as the first two.  Hope the next one will be better
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Between Angry birds and the Star Wars version, this falls in to place. Just gave it a quick run through and enjoyed it.
B008Q00BOQ|2.0|It was just same old mix of non sense.  The heroine didn't seem to know much of acting.  A total disappointment
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts out easy and gets progressively harder as you go. It's a great way to build up memory and logic skills. With all of the levels, it's going to take a long time to get bored.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|this site is worth every second. can't wait to get started on the third season.  can't imagine where their gonna take it next!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What a gem this book is. It stays with me to this day. The story is well written, painful and heartwrenching but hopeful to the end.<br />I won't give away the story......do yourself a good deed. Buy this book...tell your friends.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Very imaginative concept and exciting story that grabs u from the start. Likely geared towards young adults but I loved it all the same.
0802473156|4.0|I really found this book great and helpful for many people. I am a little taken back by the heavier use of the bible as the only text reference and Jesus' love as the main example of love. I am not a christian so that I read the book cover to cover in a weekend says it's pretty great! I am also a psychologist and think Gary Chapman, as much of the world agrees, does a fine job helping couples understand love and communication...that said. No quick fixes for relationship issues, the book serves as a good starting point.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I made couple of photos using this already and it is great. I'm happy with it and would definitely recommend.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I think the screen writer included alot of himself in this story line.Great job!. Every teenager should see this movie it, says alot about the comings of age.

B0049CVUNG|1.0|I am an older computer user, so I am willing to admit I missed something.  However, when I received it and it was written in German, I was worried but my son encouraged me to try it first.  I had to wait for my son to come over and reattach my DVD player, but it wouldn't accept the CD. At that point I contacted Amazon and the DVD is on it's way back to the sender, IN SWITZERLAND!  Even though they said it advertised the different language and format, I went into my original order and couldn't see where it said that!
B009MYARIK|3.0|Way too much inner dialogue...  Characters are flighty and circumstances are EXTREMELY over the top!  Wouldn't recommend unless you want just simple, mindless reading...  Even for chick lit, this fell way below par for me.

0393317552|4.0|Jared Diamond can take seemingly the most boring topics and make them endlessly fascinating. While not quite as good as Collapse (perhaps read this first), I would definitely consider it a must-read for anyone who wants to have a broad understanding of the world around them.<br /><br />This covers pretty much the entire history of humanity with emphasis on why some societies ended up dominating others, and it totally works. It completely dispels the all too common notion that some societies succeeded because they were made up by &#34;better&#34; people, a blatantly racist reading of history that is implicit in most common interpretations of world historical events.
B0013ND30M|5.0|This was my favorite of all the fairy tales that Disney produced when I was a child.  It even had a great dragon when compared to others that have been designed.  The comedy is better as an adult, too.  It was fun to see it again.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Fun and addictive. When things start winding down in the evening it's nice to have a game that keeps your attention but is enjoyable.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow! I just completed &quot;The Room&quot; and will definitely buy the next addition. I couldn't stop. A lot like &quot;Mist&quot; but so much more fun on my kindle fire. I loved playing this game. You can tell from the beginning the creators put their hearts into this one and I'm so glad they did! This review may sound like an over-sell but I'm very happy ;D
B000QRIGJY|5.0|In Michael Connelley's \\"The Overlook\\", Harry Bosch finds himself afraid on a couple of occasions. In one scene in particular, he catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror and he doesn't like what he sees: worry. Little wonder: the crime was not your garden variety killing; the murder of Dr. Stanley Kent might be the prologue to a terrorist's nuclear plans.<br /><br />Working with his ex-lover and now FBI Agent, Rachel Walling (a veteran of \\"Echo Park\\"), and mentoring his new partner, Ignacio Ferras, Bosch finds himself in the unchartered waters of international intrigue, a complex of federal agencies and, oh yeah, nuclear destruction. It is a complex case. And worse for all involved, the clock is ticking. Whoever has the stolen nuclear material--cesium, in this case--has a sizeable head-start on law enforcement.<br /><br />Because of the critical time issue (the book's action takes place within 12 hours), the narrative, at times, seems a little rushed or choppy. This probably has something to do with the fact that the book's original format was a serial novel, written for and published by The New York Times. In the end notes, however, Michael Connelley explains that he was given months to rework the text and add extra plotting devices and elements. In the end, I found the book to be of the standard high quality that I always hold Connelley up to. I was not disappointed and obviously recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries and suspense. There is plenty of both!
0375507256|5.0|I would recommend this read to anyone. It had everything from politics to romance to science fiction. If you haven't seen the movie, you should go see it asap. It is a masterpiece.

B000FC146C|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  I just wish it was on TV more often.  I read the book when it came out in the 80s and fell in love.  I fell in love with the movie and I loved the acting just as much.  they were very believable........  I can't believe this book is being re-distributed and I hope it becomes another best seller!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|fast shipping. great price. good 3D effects. Story starts off good. Leaves  you in suspense at the end. Cant wait for the next one. Lots of similiarities to Lord of The Rings.

0793542049|3.0|This book relies on sight reading of music, which comes easier for some than others.  With so many forms of tablature available, which simplify the process of translating from the book to the fretboard, it's disappointing to see that this book insists on the old, tedious-to-learn reading of notes from the traditional music staff.  The book states that \\"if you are interested in becoming a professional musician, I highly recommend that you make reading a priority.\\"  The problem is for those of us who have no such interest, but want to enjoy playing music and had hoped to pick up some bass tips and techniques from this book.  To add the burden of learning to instantly recognize and translate the notes from the bass clef to the fretboard puts a big damper on the whole idea of enjoying learning and playing music. The author himself admits that many great bass players never learned to read music.<br /><br />I've played the guitar for about 40 years, not professionally, but in public places, jamming with others or solo, and have had a great time at it; I never learned anything useful on guitar until I broke away from the formal, read-music-from-staff approach and started playing music I liked and could enjoy, using chords and filling in notes as I learned, jamming with others and, if I really needed documentation for exact notes, resorting to easy to read guitar tabs.  I recently branched out to ukuleles, a very fun instrument, and a U-bass, which is why I sought some help from this book.<br /><br />Sight reading for some of us can take a lot of time and effort, and it's compounded by the fact that most of us have learned the treble clef notes, and how they translate to a particular instrument.  So all of that is out the window, because the bass clef notes are different; you must first figure out which note is defined on the line or space, and then you have to translate that note to where it is on your instrument.  With tabs, they generally show the string and fret where the note is, so it's quick and simple...one can learn quickly and begin enjoying playing, rather than the nose-to-the-grindstone approach (which is what causes many to abandon their instrument after a short time).<br /><br />If you're making a career of being a bass player, by all means, spend the time and endure the drudgery of learning sight reading of the bass clef.  If sight reading comes easy for you, it may be no big deal to learn from this book.  But if you're familiar with music, music theory, chords and how they go together, and just want to pick up some techniques for a new experience and fun with the bass, there must be better books available.  The added CD is nice, but it doesn't make up for having to agonizingly go through translating the notes to the fretboard. Frankly, I can do better listening to the CD, finding the bass notes being played and rhythm used, and learn it a whole lot easier than trying to figure it out from the book, so the book is unnecessary.<br /><br />Also, the book wastes a lot of space going over the same thing in different keys, which is pointless, because once you learn progressions in one key, transposing to any other key is simple once you understand the process...you don't need a listing for each different key, they're all the same relationship.  And while it's nice to be able to play in any key, the examples given are often in keys like E flat or B flat...no guitar player ever plays in those keys if he can help it, and most likely only with a capo, so why have the lessons in those keys?  The author is a music teacher, which in itself is fine, but many music teachers assume everyone should go through all the formalities and drudgery of learning what they were taught in music school.  And they tend to play in \\"orchestra\\" keys like E flat and B flat.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want formal bass training in hopes of making it a serious endeavor in the future, perhaps this book will be for you, if you can buckle down and learnsight reading.  If you just want to have a good time with music and are perhaps adding bass to your instrument list to jam with friends or at events, I would think twice before ordering this book.sight reading.

B008HK3XU4|5.0|Fits the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; perfectly.  I suspect those with a bad fit bought the wrong size case for their kindle.  I've had it a month, the magnet works fine and the case is such a cool purple color.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|BONES ARE FOREVER :I know this is a good book because I have read all of her other books over the years. Unfortunately, my copy of Bones Are Forever was bad and I had to call and report it.  It seems that I kept reading the same pages over and over....I was told that they had had lots of problems with that book and credited my account $3.12.  I see that it is still offered on you life and wonder if it is the same copy I had or what.  I would still like to read the book.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|There were moments when Matthew McConaughey wasn't playing Matthew McConaughey which were interesting. The script tried to make him a sleazeball lawyer and failed miserably. Someone with a legal background (other than an actor's legal team) should have looked at this and made the courtroom scenes halfway realistic. Oh, wait. Then it would have made sense.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|My one problem with the album is that the sound is not studio quality. This album left me yearning for a Brittany's voice. It does not come through clearly and the band is too loud. I read somewhere in an interview that they aimed for a vinyl sound. They should put out another version of this same album with studio sound and leave the vinyl sounds for vinyls! Duh!!!

B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good game, a favorite when I want to entertain myself. It would be good for beginners because it let's you cheat if you want to. But then cheating is about personal integrity isn't it?
B007P7UF0G|5.0|Who can resist Richard Harris?!!  Loved watching this movie again and am more than happy to have it in my DVD collection.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|The game's target audience is preteens. Most children over 12 would find this boring after a day.<br /><br />The game's objective is in-game purchases; to have your children purchase coins to continue playing.  If you don't purchase pearls/coins/jewels to continue, then you'll have to wait anywhere from 3 to 10 hours. My daughter lost interest after having to wait to play.  Time to delete it.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Terrific visually and an engaging narrative with kickass acting and a balanced portral of the times. Worth rewatching and purchasing.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Beautifully, thoughtfully written. The book avoids sentimentality, and the prose keeps one 'hooked' on Harold and his journey. The denouement was surprising.

B00APUQT7I|2.0|The first Ice Age was delightful and they have just gone downhill. I think the trailer had all the funny parts.
B005TBN04S|3.0|I can no longer laugh at identical plot lines in sequals. the 3rd was at least an effort it seems they just made this one just for the fact of chow getting arrested just to lay ground for the 3rd one. 1.5 hrs of what can't even be called humor just far fetched face-palming disturbia. I'm sorry for all those who actually like this movie and others like it. I love a good far fetched slapstick (such as wedding crashers) but with a bit more tact moderation and creativity.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I love all the LOTR series, and this was great too. It's slower than the other movies though since the book is broken into so many movies. Oh well.
B000002KNY|5.0|The Talking Heads owned the world's turntables with the releases of their smashing albums, [[ASIN:B000002KNU '77]] and [[ASIN:B000002KNV More Songs About...]]. Brian Eno, who had produced their second album, was to produce their finest work, Fear of Music, as well as the largely disappointing [[ASIN:B000002KO3 Remain in Light]]. FoM moved away from the art punk pop songs of their first two albums to a more serious sound. It remains their crowning masterpiece. What followed was a steady degeneration into funk, Afro-rhythms and blandness. It was a sad end to a great band with a great sound.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|The costumes, music, actors, everything was so wonderful. I haven't seen any other Les Miserable versions so I can't compare it.
B000065EXI|5.0|This Diana Krall album reminds me of an early Holly Cole album, [[ASIN:B000005HBB Don't Smoke in Bed]]. Both singers have built their careers singing old jazz standards. This has both given them a niche and made them somewhat redundant. Although I have collected many of the original songs from the '50s and '60s, vocal jazz is a low listening priority. Do I need more? No. Still, Diana seduces with this silky smooth set of standards.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is one of the best comic movies ever, entertaining all along. Looks wonderful in Blu-ray. It's worth every buck.
B00000I41J|5.0|There isn't much to say about this one. This is jazz anyone could like and it's possibly Cannonball's best. My earlier review must have vanished, as I have had this album for decades.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I bought this as I am always looking for books like The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society and this one came up as a match. Harold Fry is on a spur of the moment pilgrimage, completely unprepared physically and mentally, yet finds strength in the journey through self-examination, reflection and the crazy characters along the way. A stale marriage, difficult son, retirement from a somewhat unfulfilling job and precarious friendship make you root for Harold all the way. A story of forgiveness, finding a lost self and reconnecting and renewing marriage made this one of my favorites of the year.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|My grandson loves this games and is pretty good at it.  I do wish that more explanation was given so you knew what to do without having to waste a lot of time experimenting.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Bullets fly. Nazis are defeated. A hero is born.<br /><br />Gruff boss that's really a good guy after all? Hero that bends the rules to do the right thing? A chaste love interest for the hero? Scenery-chewing villain? Check, check, check, check.<br /><br />Given this formula, does this movie execute it well? Actually, yeah, pretty well. If you're the kind of person that rolls his eyes when 1001 bullets miss the hero, you won't like this movie. If you're cool with suspension of disbelief when it makes for a rollicking good time, then you'll enjoy it quite a bit, as we did.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This app is amazing. Love the game. It's about building your own Jurrasic Park. Love the quality, sounds and hints.
B0067AC5KA|3.0|This book was riveting. I wanted to know what would happen next at every page.  And all the endings were satisfactory. It was interesting to be confronted with the differences between American and Swedish culture and laws. The characters and relationships were for the most part well thought out and developed. I found the main<br />character's last relationship a little unbelievable, as in, I didn't get it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />There is a lot of sexual stuff, both by the criminals (Seriously seemed like all the bad guys were pedophiles or hated women) and the main characters: however, it is not overly graphic. I don't believe that the sexual behaviors depicted here are very realistic and certainly not as prevalent in reality as they are in this book. In that respect the book crosses a line of believability.<br />Also there were A LOT of characters, some with similar-ish names, which ended up hard to keep straight.

B0017R5UA0|5.0|This came in on time and in perfect condition. Sub Pop records really know how to put together a great record. It's a big double disc gatefold and it's full of stuff for you to read while you listen, plus it's got all the songs you bought available for free mp3 download! It comes with a nice brand new 'fleet foxes' lp and to my surprise, it also had 'sun giant' and I thought that was great. Fleet Foxes is a great bad for great people, buy it!
0316228532|3.0|Rowling has done an outstanding job in creating a multitude of characters that all have their own passions, ideas, hurts, idiosyncracies and agendas.  In other multi-protagonist novels I have read, usually only one or two characters really get developed and the rest are filler.  Rowling has not created a single character that she doesn't know intimately.<br /><br />The writing is excellent and flows as smoothly as the dialogue.  The story (or many stories) are realistic but painful.  There is much angst and little redemption for the inhabitants of this suburban British town.  I understand that a 'happy ending' would have been trite and not served the novel or its characters, but I was left with a feeling of hopelessness for all the amazing, multi-dimensional people I met in this book.  The sadness was overwhelming.
B00BNR6RH4|5.0|I have only seen one review of the 2013 vinyl edition as of this writing, so I thought I'd put one up in case someone out there isn't sure whether or not to pull the trigger on the vinyl version of Wings Over America. For the sound - YES, you want this. As I opened the well-packaged (double-boxed) album, the first thing I saw - which brought a grin to my face - was a \\"Discs Made In Germany\\" sticker on the rear cover (on the cellophane, not the cover itself). As a vinyl lover for over 50 years, I have always found German pressings to be excellent quality, and this issue of WOA is no exception. The lead ins and outs were quiet as a dead mouse; of course being a live recording, there is no silence between the tracks. The sound quality is excellent, and has excellent dynamics. The bass, like the original, is still quite prominent in the mix much of the time, which I expected as this is a remaster, not a remix. However there is a fuller, warmer sound to the bass than on the UK CD issue I bought a few years back. The cover art is faithfully reproduced other than the now familiar \\"archive collection\\" white border on the left edge of the cover. The back cover, unlike the original vinyl version -which I have, has been \\"built out\\" to easily accommodate discs 2 & 3. The original poster is included. As promised, a 320kbps mp3 download card is included. What i DIDN'T expect is that they included the 8 song bonus \\"Cow Palace\\" set as well, along with a digital booklet that contains pictures and set lists.<br />One of the cool things about the vinyl edition are the theme-specific sides; Side 3, for example, is an all acoustic set, Side 5 is all songs from the then-newly released \\"Wings At The Speed Of Sound.\\" This has always been a great memory for me as I saw this this tour at the Toronto Maple Leaf Gardens with my best friend.<br />I give this my highest recommendation for McCartney lovers, vinyl lovers, and classic rock lovers everywhere.<br />That's basically it.

The twists on the story kept it interesting & made me keep turning the page (figuratively).<br /><br />I will definitely read the sequel which I hope will have deeper & richer character development which I found missing from this book.  Hence the 4 star rating.
B00AAIHAGO|5.0|I saw this on its initial theatrical release and felt it was too far over the top and too violent. but today, after several viewings I regard it as a great film. pacino has never been better, tho carlito's way is my favorite pacino flick. I loved the tv show Miami vice, and it seems to me that show owes a lot to this film. this film was intended as a cautionary tale about a life of crime, but has had the reverse effect with many, notably some gangsta rappers. much like WALL STREET was an indictment of the streets excesses but became an inspiration to a new generation of WALL STREETERS who embraced Gordon gecko. both great films explore unethical greed and excess, and reflect the 80's culture of greed very artistically. oliver stone of course wrote the original scarface adaptation, and wrote and directed WALL STREET.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I struggled through half of the movie and finally turned it off.  I love Tom Hanks and Halle Berry ... but this was one weird movie.  I think the writer was in a drug-induced state when this was written.  Can you guess I just didn't like it at all!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I got this game one day when it was the free app of the day and it would still be a great buy if I had paid for it. There are so many different levels it is unbelievable and all the well loved formations are there. If you love Mahjong and don't want all the themes, this is the app for you.
B000FC13Y0|4.0|The story is wonderfully written the characters are real,I truly enjoyed it!  A great coming of age and discovery tale.
B00003CXCQ|1.0|It doesn't play on my DVD player anymore and when it did it has this camera picture on the upper right corner.  Also the dvd box art looks like it came from a kodak printer.  Very disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You are going to be addicted the FIRST time you play.... Much more variety and faster... Don't blink, or you'll die.... It's that fast.....
B003VW54QO|5.0|I love this movie, infact I watched it several times while I was in the hospital following my heart attack.  John Wayne is WONDERFUL in this movie so are Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson, The story is one of my favorite with John Wayne playing the straight sheriff who finds himself facing a corrupt and powerful Rancher, Ward Bond. John Wayne arrest the Ranchers no good bully of a younger brother, played by a young Claude Akins, for killing an unarmed man.  John suddenly finds himself needing back-up and getting it from several unlikely characters. Dean MArtin plays the washed out drunk who once was a pretty gun fighter and Ricky Nelson plays the younger cleaner version of Dean's character.  Add to the cast a young redheaded Angie Dickinson as John Wayne's love interest and distraction and you have one great movie.  This movie is one of my all time favorites and I can remember watching with my when I was little. I am 44 now and I still watch it every chance I get.
B0084670FU|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I've watched, or attempted to watch... I couldn't even finish it.  Maybe if I finished it it would have been knitted together to make sense but, the senseless vignettes in this movie made it impossible for me to finish the movie and see the director's brilliance.  I can not recommend this movie to anyone, period.
B0058BII4G|5.0|Having previously seen episodes of TBBT \\"catch as catch can,\\" by aimlessly turning on the television and viewing episodes at random (sometimes starting in the middle), I wanted to begin with Season 1, Episode 1, and watch the entire series in order, which I've been doing courtesy of Amazon. (I've also concurrently been reading reviews of each episode at A.V. Club online -- but never read reviews written by people who aren't fans of the show.)<br /><br />Watching any show in order of broadcast should give the viewer a good idea as to whether it's getting better, worse, or staying the same, and whether the characters are stagnating, growing, or devolving.  I maintain that TBBT is getting better in every way.  The \\"bestie\\" relationship between Amy (Mayim Bialik) and Penny (Kaley Cuoco) just keeps getting more adorable, and adding Raj's sister Priya as a romantic foil to Penny's non-love for Leonard makes things a bit more interesting. I acted in community theatre for 14 years and every director I had gave the same advice: \\"Have fun! If you're not having fun, the audience won't, either.\\"  Every character/actor on TBBT seems to be having fun with his/her part, and that makes the watching even more delicious.  Plus, now that we know our characters so well, it's a hoot to look forward to getting all those accruing questions answered:  Will Raj ever talk to females without alcohol?  Will Howard really break free of his mother?  Will Sheldon and Amy \\"do the dance with no pants\\"? (And, if so, will Leonard's mom get jealous?)<br /><br />This is all great fun and I look forward to my \\"Big Bang\\" moments with relish.  Only one thing nags at me: all the critics say that the show was meant to be Johnny Galecki's and that Jim Parsons' \\"Sheldon\\" has stolen the lead right out from under him (unintentionally, I'm sure, but there it is).  I worry whether this eats at Mr. Galecki....whether it gets in the way of his and Mr. Parsons' friendship...those kinds of things.  Whenever I see Leonard scowl on the show, I always wonder if he's doing some method acting, drawing on his despair at playing second Chiquita to Parsons.  On the less-than-slim chance that he's reading this, I want to assure Johnny Galecki that the ability to successfully play straight man to someone else's demented antics is far trickier than it seems.  Few actors have the chops to do it, and if he can just hang in there (oh please don't let me see an Enquirer headline like 'FED-UP GALECKI CALLS IT QUITS!'), I feel certain that his best leading roles are yet to come. Anyway, it's not his fault: Leonard wasn't truly written as a lead -- the zanier character will always get the attention (think Richie Cunningham vs. The Fonz).<br /><br />In sum, TBBT is as fun as it ever was. I can't wait to see what happens next: always a good sign. If I could just stop worrying about Johnny Galecki, it would be an almost-perfect viewing experience.
B00BTLSURE|4.0|I have been a fan of this group since their first single was released. I was so excited when I heard that they were making new music and when I read the reviews that this was their best album yet I believed it. However, I disagree with those reviews. This album is good. It has the classic OneRepublic sound which I love. But I am a lyrics person and I just didnt think the lyrics on this album lived up to the high standard of their past albums. There were really only 2 songs that I didnt like at all, &#34;Something's Gotta Give&#34; and &#34;Light it Up&#34;. Despite that, it IS a good album and I do reccomend it, just dont expect it to be better than Waking Up. I will say though, get the Deluxe edition, because &#34;Life in Color&#34; is worth the price of the whole album.
1563523302|5.0|I have given three copies as college graduation presents and each time, I get recurrent comments and thanks for the book and the info it provides. A gift that actually can keep on giving.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There is nothing bad I could say about Colleen Hoovers writng.  I enjoyed it more than I can put into words.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read all 3 one of the best. I cant what to see the moves! I could not but it down
0671891634|5.0|Who to study under than someone who has done it successfully for over a decade.  The actual strategy of a big money manager.  A must read.

B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Loved it, best Cruise movie ever!! Not over the top like some of his stuff, great action and good acting.<br />Would see it again in a heartbeat.
B0063IH60K|5.0|All the other apps make me bored and this is my favorite! It'sawesome that it includes hints and is fantastic
B00CFQN12Q|2.0|It's what you think it probably is, crap.  And twelve words here I come almost there wait a second there!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book, a real page turner. It has been a long time since I have had a book I couldn't put down. I like the way the author writes I would read more books by this author
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|The story started out really slow, I expected more because the Trailer was really interesting.  The end was unexpected, but I was already tired of watching the movie when it picked up.  Would not recommend to a friend.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|The book is interesting, it's just very wordy. But I'm pretty sure that's how Stephen King writes, this is my first book I've read by him.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Probably not much to say about the story that hasn't been said before, but I'm really getting pulled in to the intrigue and drama. I think I know who I want to claim the throne in the end, and then I switch loyalties (like many of the bannermen of Westeros) and start rooting for someone else.<br /><br />All in all, I couldn't wait to start Feast of Crows when I finished this one - that's always a good sign in a sweeping epic like this.
B000OV85AW|5.0|I just consider this, and other great films from the 70s to be the peak of film making.Great story, great acting, and no special effects.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|To be completely Honest i think they should have stopped at the end of 5, fast 5 was a great ending and everyone was rich and happy, (((some spoiler alerts))) these movies have become much less about the cars and alot more about action adventure. I still like them.  This franchise has the potential to just keep going and going, The only thing i didnt like about this one was it was very, very predictable.. and yes, some of the action scenes were a little over the top and venturing into clearly unrealistic turf..  the only FF movie i didnt care for was Tokyo Drift and the end of this one points clearly to a tie in to that movie. I will keep watching.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is a great game. The leveling is a little off but other than that it's good. It's a lot easier to have friends that play too
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Personally I did not like this game cause it is simply to easy when I read the reviews I thought I was buying a challenging game but I was wrong by a mile I do not want to give it one star but I'm have to
B00785P2QC|5.0|like to build a city and make choice this is the game for all to play hours of fun and games
B000SEI230|5.0|A beautiful book you will never forget I recommend it to whoever believes in angels. Hopefully thats everyone. A walk to remember. My new favorite.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I bought this product for my Kindle, paid shipping fees which cost more than the device only to find out that it does not work.
B008JFUP0I|2.0|Fast and The Furious 6 was an okay movie.These movies are great for any age group. It was an entertaining but it wasn't great. The soundtrack is what caught my attention during the whole film.When there was tense scene the music was at a slower pace than when things got exciting the beat was good. The plot behind this movie wasn't good. Like they shouldn't have added the Rock in to the series. Letty not dying wasn't that great because how do you not know who you're putting in the ground. The fight scences in this movie were terrible, in the first movie it was a lot better. With modern technology they could have made it better. I like how they brought back Tokyo Drift because not a lot of people saw that movie so if you haven't seen all the fast and furious movies you need to or you're just going to get confused. Overall it was a good entertaining film but just a little touch up than it would have been the best movie of the year.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|I love this show I have to say sam is my favorite character in this show and Dean is funny even when he's sarcastic about situation lmao
B001PJRAUS|3.0|I saw this movie on Netflix and had to get it but for some reason, the video quality is pretty poor. The camera work is very shaky/bouncy. I'm not sure what is going on but it wasn't like this on Netflix.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Yes, I would recommend this cute game to anyone, I can be played by young or old, of course I love Nemo!
B00COHAUD4|4.0|This was a very scary movie ,I was jumping out of my seat and I usually do'nt get scared very easily.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good but not the best novel of his. Took too long to find out why banister was in prison<br />to begin with.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Thought my wife and I would watch a movie together.  She heard about this movie, but after about 10 minutes of it, we turned it off.  Just a terrible beginning that didn't get our attention.  Maybe it is for the younger generations, but not for people in their 50's or 60's.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I had fun with this game. It helped with my down time on a recent excursion to the country of India. I could not play it while riding in the car but it was fun to spend time on at the hotel.<br /> Some of them are challenging. I would recommend it for people who like hidden object games. That was the majority of the game. It took an appropriate amount of time based on the price. Other than that, i think i wouldn't mind playing it again sometime. Maybe not while i am still in India but probably later when i am back in America.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|Everybody else have left spoilers, but fortunately, I didn't read the reviews, before I bought the book. I was told by friends that it was good, so I picked it up, and I was immediately hooked by the story.<br /><br />Sure, I saw a \\"then\\" instead of a \\"than\\", and even at another place it was \\"than\\" instead of \\"then\\", but who cares?<br /><br />I loved the story and was highly entertained.<br /><br />And about a third way into the book, I got my first surprise. Who are playing detectives??? Noooo :)<br /><br />Ha, that was awesome! I really loved that idea.<br /><br />Of course the heroine is a beauty and the hero a gorgeous guy, but that's what we want to read when we're relaxing, isn't it?<br /><br />In my case it is. I've always loathed the books in the social realism genre that were so popular in Denmark, where I grew up. Poverty, ugly people, sorrows, problems...<br /><br />No thanks!<br /><br />I would rather read about Lexy and her grandmother and her cute neighbor.<br /><br />And that recipe at the end came as a nice surprise for me, too. Yeah, I had only read the beginning of the description of the book.<br /><br />This book is a nice and short read. I'm going to grab the next in the series now.
B0087ITBT8|5.0|Well, we loved it. No filthy language, no nudity, many laughs for anyone who happens to have grown-up \\"children.\\" In spite of the friction between the characters, you sense a whole lot of sincere love. I'll bet many of us know a mother/son combo like this. At the end, all the loose ends are tied up with a bow or at least alluded to. Ahhh, this is the way movies used to be. It left us smiling.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|A fairly short story from Steinbeck, but a great weekend read.  I would highly recommend it for a weekend getaway

B001BC5HXG|5.0|I am only about 1/3 of the way through the book but I thoroughly enjoy it.  It is truly a classic. Steinbeck at his best.
B0011UGLK6|5.0|Lahiri's writing is plaintive. Reading parts of her stories that should be celebratory are tinged with sadness. In my humble opinion she expertly captures the difficulties and anxieties that immigrants feel when they have to adapt to a new culture and a new language. The feeling of being in limbo between the familiar and the new is on every page and is felt by every character. It takes extraordinary skill to write about everyday life and bring the small nuances to the surface and work with them until the reader can feel the confusion, wonder and struggle of not quite ever being able to assimilate. Positively fine writing.
B003TH2LYY|5.0|A witty and sometimes moving TV series.  Wonderful cast of characters.  Well-written and well-acted.  Love this show.  Can't wait for Season Six.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Very well done - the colors and neon look are great. Sound and gameplay work well. Nice job SpikePit Games!  ;-)
1439127727|5.0|If you are interested in how American history has been shaped and continues to be shaped by those who became president then this book is for you.  I especially loved the chapters on Bush 41 and Bill Clinton.  I never knew that Herbert Hoover played such a significant role in the recovery of Europe after World War II.  Nor dd I know much about the feud between Eisenhower and Kennedy and how it was resolved for the good of the nation.  Patriotism to me is having the courage to act as an agent of change when necessary and to let history take its course when needed.  I was always taught that &#34;My country right or wrong; when right to be kept right and when wrong to be set right.&#34;.  It takes wisdom to know the difference and for most of the 20th and the 21st centuries, we have been fortunate as a nation to have had presidents who knew the difference and acted accordingly.  This is a great book.  I hope you enjoy it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Very exciting..kinda greusome but I like that.  Call me weird!!! I like being able to get the whole season at once and doing a marathon.

030746363X|1.0|Let me start by saying that I have not read this book. I Googled weight loss, saw a blog, then looked this book up. The majority of the review days are same day or back-to-back. The majority of the reviewers have only  commented on the author's other books or this book. I was tempted to buy the book but since the reviews appear shady, it is likely that the book is not worth my time. Be sure to look at other items the reviewer has commented on before purchasing to ensure the comment is legit.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|Awsome pictures and music. Relaxing, inspiring, and at the same time very instructive. Wish I could learn the places where it was filmed.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|Loving this game, I personally enjoy immersion in video games and therefore insert myself in the in-game story wherever. Let me tell you, being the godhand that gets to build ponyville from the ground up is quite a bit of fun. It does, however, require patience. But of course that's the kind of game this is. NOW, about Rarity costing gems... Yes, I think this is a terrible concept, but I have found a working solution, but be warned it WILL take a very long time. Every time you launch the game 4 and 5 days in a row (maybe 3, I'm not sure) you get a few gems. Every time you level up, you get a gem. Sometimes Derpy (the pony in the box) will cough up a gem or two. Just keep repeating this process until you have 70 gems. Should take more than a month but you'll get there. NEW PLAYERS DO NOT SPEND GEMS, SAVE THEM TO BUY RARITY AND PROGRESS.
B0009P66TK|5.0|I have a large wrist and this thing is enormous on my wrist.  I get a lot of compliments about it, and the glow in the dark hands work pretty well if you are out in the sun a lot.  They don't last as long as I would like, but I don't have it in direct sunlight enough to keep the charge.  The winder takes a bit to find where it is resisting for you to stop winding, but it keeps time perfectly after that.  Having the crown and buttons on the left is the greatest thing ever.  I am right handed but wear my watch on the left and will never buy another watch that isn't like this.  It also has a great band on it.  I don't wear it on my wrist for everything, and it has still molded nicely.  Can't say enough about how good this product is.  I will be buying more Invicta watches in the future.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This book is so beautifully and creatively written! I loved every word of it. Could not put it down!!! Must read!
B003GLJD6M|5.0|Thank you for the prompt arrival of the book! It is in great shape. A gem. I would reorder from this indie bookstore anytime!
B00CLOTNLK|5.0|This album is wonderful.  It is definately PROGTASTIC!!! I highly recommend buying it. Sound of Contact, please come to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania :)
1601251505|5.0|If your looking to get back into D&D then don't waste your time with the D&D version 3.5 rules, pick up this version instead. I'm very pleased with the purchase.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|I have really enjoyed reading this series since I began them a few months ago.  The characters are well developed in my opinion and I almost feel like I am witnessing everything that is happening.  Some folks say they don't like &#34;time travel&#34; books, but I am thoroughly enjoing this!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I love this movie.  It yields more depth with successive viewings and provides a heart-opening perspective on the human spirit.  Also has some marvelous acting!  A great movie to own.
B0052YAKS6|5.0|I am a middle aged Mom who likes to get her groove on.  This is a fun album if you like to dance.
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|Some great acting and provides a very interesting look at pre-WWI through post-WWI life in England.  As the 2nd season  goes on, the character development both strengthens and falters (depending on the character).  Also, plots get a bit soapy.  Still, Maggie Smith is totally worth it, as are some others.
030759565X|5.0|I buy a lot of recipe books, and this is one of my favorites.  I have a husband and son with food allergies and I can make any of the recipes in this book for them (with little modifications here and there).  Just look at the photo on the cover...doesn't it make you want to rush out and pick some cherry tomatoes and make this for lunch?  All the photos in the book look this good, and the recipes are even better.  Try the snickerdoodle bars - HEAVEN!!!
B00B5ARKDE|3.0|I feel the Trailer makes this out to be a better movie then what it was.  It had some highlights, but over all it was average...
B00C061I3K|5.0|it's not a Daft punk album that you would normally be used to, but it is superb none the less especially after the sound track to tron. Very mellow, laid back and easy listening.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|What became of his other relationships? They were just as valid as his relationship with Tiffany & just as much a part of the story. Now I need some closure! The ending was far too premature.<br /><br />This book was nothing like what I suspected it to be; I had no idea (based on the title alone) that it would be so sad & depressing. A good read, nonetheless... that is if you enjoy premature endings.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I'm a huge Kanye West fan and this one of my favorite albums all time!! All of kanye's music is amazing but this album cant be put into words.
B002HL3PN4|5.0|The kids really enjoyed this movie.  The kids ages range from 7 to 11.  We are looking into the second one because they all want to see it!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Seriously, if you're really into past lives and karma you MIGHT enjoy this. Outside of that, it wasn't interesting at all. And for 3 hours? You could probably find something better to do.
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|The premise is great, just not well executed. I think they must have had more material than money, because it felt disjointed between episodes.
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|This movie wasted a great deal of talent both in the actors and the amazing choreography. The movie was a bit too cartoony visually.
B00847KFDS|4.0|I'll start by posting my age (61)so you know where I'm coming from. For me, Credence songs are classic; they were the soundtrack of so much of my \\"formative years.\\"  I think Fogerty's Long Road Home double concert album is one of the best concert albums every recorded.  So, he's taken a real chance here, screwing 'round with music we love.  And, for the most part it pays off royally!  Every so often an artist ought to look back at some of his early work, collaborate with new folks and see how it can all be re-imagined.  The stuff here is fresh and, when you come right down to it, the music is just good, real good; on some tracks, great.  Be sure to turn up the volume before you press \\"play\\" and enjoy Fogerty and Foo Fighters tear through \\"Fortunate Son.\\"  \\"Lodi\\" gets a nice, laid-back treatment, Fogerty and his sons.  Miranda Lambert adds a wonderful wistful yearning to the title track.  Some fans make be a little taken aback by how jaunty \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" sounds at the hands of the Zac Brown Band; but, on some days when I'm not in that dark, bad moon, mood, this is a version that looks at that \\"trouble on the way\\" and laughs in its face.  I do have a few minor quibbles.  For me, Kid Rock adds nothing to \\"Born on the Bayou\\".  I'm just glad that, musically, Fogerty has the last say; the Kid is last heard well enough before the song ends to restore things to where they should be.  \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\" with Bob Seger is just too short a track.  Seger's presence on the song is terrific; I only wish he and Fogerty could have made more of the song to extend the pleasure of what they've got going. It's all gone much too soon.  And the inclusion of \\"Hot Rod Heart\\"?  It's a great song; but, on album that's (mostly) devoted to finding new musical meaning in Credence classics, \\"Hot Rod Heart\\" (a solo Fogerty  tune) is just too recent to need re-imaging.  I could think of a half-dozen Credence songs I would rather have heard instead.  Still,  This is a really enjoyable album.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|Go back and view this version of TGG and I assure you that you will see a depth never achieved in the current version in theaters.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|The movie was just a lot more then I expected it had the right amount of humor mixed in, but it had a serious side to it, that you could really relate to.
B00BESM14U|4.0|I know no movie ever turns out as good as the book....that being said, I'm not sure the main character shines through very well in the movie. However, as a movie compared to other movies, it's good.
B00C8985DU|4.0|Box set arrived yesterday (day of release) and I am happy I decided on this (very heavy) deluxe edition.<br />Everything is high quality and you can see and feel that a lot of love and care was put into manufacturing \\"WOA 2013\\".<br />The tour book alone is worth a couple of dollars and the slipcase is very sturdy and thick.<br />The photographs are, just like so many taken from 70's bands, larger than life! You get the classic on stage images, but also the backstage scenes, concert venues, fans, life on the road, airports, inside bus and plane images and more.<br />As far as the sound goes, I've listen to the CD's only once so far and being used to to my WOA vinyl for the past 24 years, the first things that came to my ears were Paul's Rickenbacker with more volume and more up front, Joe's drums with more weight and density. Overall it seems to be a more compact and leveled mix, than the original with less air between the instruments. I have to say though, Jimmy McCulloch and Denny Laine's guitars seem to have lost a little bit of power in this remaster. I might be wrong, but that's what I've felt.<br />The DVD (excellent image quality) is a fine and very complete documentary and nicely rounds up the whole package!<br />The only thing that I didn't like so much was the set on the San Francisco bonus CD. With all due respect, I could've done without the Beatles smashers, especially \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Yesterday\\". Hard rockers like \\"Soily\\" and \\"Beware My Love\\" would have been more interesting and would have kept the bonus CD with Wings songs only. But then again, I don't know how the quality of those songs were during the SF concert. Oh, by the way...Somebody at Cow Palace is really out of tune during \\"Bluebird\\". Sorry guys...
B00BB22GQM|4.0|Less African pop influenced, but still Paul Simon-like, this has a much more mature nature to it, lyrically, musically and vocally. With more time spent in the studio this time around they haven't lost their ability for a hook though these are even more melancholy than the previous batch. And though I hear more Squeeze/Elvis Costello than Beatles here, I'm a sucker for the Elvis-like vocal delivery of, \\"Diane Young\\" that is pure pop perfection and so similar to George Michael's \\"Faith,\\" it proves they've always been pure pop candy even if this album overall is darker in tone. Let's hope it lasts.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|with British period shows as I am, I'm sure you will love this!  I didn't know what to expect from this, as the hamlet/town theme is not one I am familiar with. But it is quite pleasant, clever, witty, at times sad, or funny. I really enjoy it.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|the only thing i could complain is the fact that the Enter and Space keys are way too sensitive in a way.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Each episode is like a mini feature movie.  Great acting.  Great story line.  Good fun.  Can't wait for season two.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I will read this series to the end but I don't like the way he ends each book. The characters are not very dimensional, very black or white.
B005HSL626|5.0|The colours and animation are very good, as well as the sound. My 9 yrs old son played it until he finally got fed up of it. It took him 3 months to reach that point.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Really loved this book. I adore Drew and his refreshing POV. Emma Chase has similar writing style as Susan Elizabeth Phillips. And SEP is one of my all time favorite authors. Emma Chase, your books are now an automatic buy for me.
B009JBZH54|1.0|VERY disappointed in this!  Inside this box set is the Ultraviolet insert and the promise of digital copy but there is NO CODE printed on the ultraviolet insert.  What kind of scam is this?  I purposely bought this because I read reviews that said it came with the Ultraviolet/digital copy.  Very lame.
B00BI745AA|1.0|I ordered this in HD quality video and Amazon did not stream it in that quality. There is nothing wrong with my streaming or speed of the bandwidth I receive. I won't be ordering HD video from them again.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|i kinda lost the thread with the original series when this book didn't come out, but continue to read was almost a breeze. Yes, some things are hard to remember, but all in all it's a good read!
B002ZG9774|5.0|Although a &#34;cheesey&#34; story line, very predictable, the music and dancing are great. Play it over and over and over again. Cher can still belt it out and don't how that voice of Christina's comes out of such a little body.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This is the best post distopian story by Dan Wells. That shouldn't disuade you from reading more from Mr. Westerfeld. All of his series are amazing.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Gives the audience some background about how it all started. Plan to watch it again to catch the nuances. Would recommend it to any Lord of the Rings fan.
B00BY9GQHM|3.0|Don't have any comments to make. Just got into game. I would recommend checking this game. Doesn't cost that much to buy and worth the money.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a great deal. The action was awesome and one-liners or just right. I found it to have a good mixture of action and humor and  an engaging story line. Oh, my 10-year-old grandson recommends it highly also.
B00CM96A60|5.0|Beautiful album !!!!!!! I have been a huge fan of his music for years now !!!!  Armin is and has always been a step ahead with all his creations and productions .......He still Kept his own usual style of mixing beautiful and classical melodies with the massive &#34;intense&#34;  track along with some beautiful vocalists such as Emma Hewitt, Aruna just to name a few and new comer Trevor Guthrie &#34;this is what it feels like&#34; is one of my favorite tracks of the album ........overall this artist album has a mixture of everything..... I highly recommend it =)
B00BDSRISA|3.0|Its what I would expect from phoenix, not a great hit with me yet. That usually takes a couple of listens  though.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was the best reading ever. It just wasn't about sex; it was about overcoming child abuse and neglect, finding your inner goddess, opening yourself up to new experiences, and letting go of the past. This was good reading and well written. highly recommended
B00CBRAD2A|4.0|I think this is a good movie for a come back tour for the Arnold, I hope they still make the new Conan.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I would recommend this book. Turns out to be a wonderful love story. thanks cant wait to read third book
B001JI5DRC|5.0|Good acting and the film is 95% spot on from what really happened!  Did a lot of research and all the major events are real and spot on.  Some of the smaller dialogs are fictional but makes a perfect movie!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|THIS BOOK IS A WELL WRITTEN ACCOUNT OF A YOUNG MAN'S LIFE AND DEATH. I FOUND IT TO BE FACTUAL AND A VERY INSPIRING BOOK FOR ANYONE TO READ. IT IS AN EASY READ AND HARD TO PUT AWAY WHEN YOU NEED TO DO OTHER THINGS. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is very relaxing. I've used it while stretching after going to the gym and it made me less tense.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Christian is every girls dream man!! Sexy, strong and HOT! But he has a softer side that he reveals and it just makes you cry and laugh. LOVE IT!!!
B008QLXSG8|4.0|My type of book full of symbolism and deeper meaning. You really dlve into the mind of the protagonist. Makes you think.
B008Y79HE6|3.0|ACTING WAS OK BUT SOME ITEMS WERE OVER THE TOP. WITH A HOLE THAT SIZE IN THE SHIP WHY DIDN'T IT JUST SINK?
B001NLL8LA|5.0|A well written, very suspenseful story. The amount of detail surrounding scenes makes the reader feel he is right there.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This movie had a great mix of traditional Hawaiian music, that is why I bought it.<br />If you like traditional Hawaiian music - this is a good one for a gathering of friends.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was my first G5 download and I was really impressed. Great graphics with unique storyline. I recommend this app and you can't beat the price.
0345803507|5.0|I got Book I; got seriously hooked on it, 2 weeks later I had to have Book 2.  I read all of it (both books in a month).  Then I just HAD to HAVE Book 3 but I couldn't find it ANYWHERE in any stores, bookstores were having to order it just to keep up with the demand...so I go to my LOYAL, and TRUSTY AMAZON website...there it was, Book 3.  If you heard about the book you will understand the rush to get the third and last book of this trilogy.  Thank you AMAZON for being there in such a desperate rush order, you can ALWAYS trust AMAZON with speedy service, great prices, and availability !
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Ok I just love this game! Its so easy to play and has tons of options to upgrade your car wheels tricks and levels. So much fun
B0076DEJMO|4.0|The style of writing was like a spaghetti western, but set in fantasy. Abercrombie made it work well, and I really enjoyed the book. in fact, I would say that it was the best of the three companion novels to the first law series, and possibly better than one or two of the books in that series.<br /><br />Some may consider the 'Western' style a bit of a gimmick and it very well may be, but it worked in this setting and I'd recommend this book as a change of pace.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love this show.  The stories are well written.  The cast of characters are too good.  These are shows worth watching.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|it was okay but i could have waited till it came out in walmart  in there $5.00 box. it wasn't what i had hoped it would be.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I really enjoy their music! I can't wait to go see them live in concert! I can't wait for new album.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Tough guys in literature abound and in the last decade our world events have created additional super spies and unbeatable operatives. While Mitch Rapp qualifies for this generic grouping kudos must be given to Flynn for creating a nuanced formula in which he places the action hero. The aspect of this formula that I enjoy the most is the justice and retribution that is applied to people who should be supporting Rapp. In this outing it was an FBI agent and a politician. I actually enjoy seeing these characters get their comeuppance more so than the blatant villains.<br /><br />Rapp remains uber-great at his job and though the author attempts to humanize and throw speed bumps his way you know that he will prevail. In this outing Rapp gets a head injury and cycles out of it a more introspective and rational fellow. Flynn misses the opportunity to sustain this change to the operative's character to mix it up a bit. Instead he recovers and is the old Mitch which is a lost opportunity. Lastly, the character of Irene Richardson is a surprising favourite for her patience and deft handling of any crisis. It is great to see that the series still entertains.
B00A6CT012|5.0|I love that she gives step by step how she did this it was and is very heloful to me and my family. I've already started and am excited to do my first shopping trip! Thank you.
B000T1GKH2|5.0|It's never boring and has some really classic moments. The extra live track and interview are a nice bonus too.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|The game plays well and fast. It is very responsive. I happen to like Freecell; it is always available in Windows OS. I have no complaints about this implementation.
B005UZ1IJC|5.0|Although not commonly considered as such, Aqualung just might be the greatest rock album ever. There are elements to this album, such as the instrumentation and lyrics, that make this album groundbreaking, unique, and timeless. In addition, the extra tracks that come on the 40th anniversary edition are well worth the extra couple of bucks.
B00A6E2AVM|3.0|I am loving the topic and enjoy learning more about each character of the show.  The book is well written and helps me to understand the era as well as the show on TV.  My disappointment is the fonts cannot be enlarged and I have trouble reading the small print.  The reader must click on each paragraph to get the size a little larger(not quite large enough for me) and then click out again each time a new paragraph is needed.  I am used to being able to quickly read a book and this is very hindering.  If I did not like the contents and the pictures so much I would not keep the book.  Maybe an update of format will come out soon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book everyone should read it its very awesome and very entertaining and makes u wanna read more
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Anne Hathaway won an Oscar for her roll in this movie. I'm not a big fan of the musical but her singing and portrayal of Fantine is exceptional.  Hugh Jackman is also very good in the lead character. This is a classic story of good verses evil set on a very large stage.
B00B19F3PG|4.0|this was a good horror movie not the best but the plot was god and the acting was fairly good
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Have been looking for all of the episodes to the Harry Potter series.  Now I have them!!!  Couldn't be happier!!!
B00B7FXZQS|3.0|this was probally the worst out of the series but it was still a decent movie. didnt really understand the ending where did all those people all of a sudden come from?
B002NJUN44|5.0|!!Wish that there was a sequel to this movie.  Held my interest all the way through the entire movie.  Great acting!!.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved this book. The first one was great as well, although this one was even more compelling. I couldn't put it down. I was a history major in college, but I learned a lot more about WWII by reading this book.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I bought 24 hour streaming for the movie over the weekend.<br /><br />we loved watching it.<br /><br />perfect for family to watch it together
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game!  It is totally addictive. I find myself playing it every day. My kids and I take turns playing to see who can get the highest score. TOO FUN!
B000U6BT40|5.0|I loved this show and really hated to see it end.  Thank you Amazon for bringing it to Prime, so I can watch all my favorite episodes!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The first i have read by this author. Everything flows perfectly together. I wish some sections were edited down allowing other sections to expand but this is personnel preference and no fault is ascribed.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|I love all of Bill Bryson's books, but this one was definitely one of his funniest and offered lots of fascinating insights on Australia.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|My husband saw this movie on the airplane and had lots of laughs.<br />He couldn't wait for me to see it.  I thought it was just as funny as he did.<br />The story line was very familiar and the acting and dialogue by Barbra Streisand and<br />Seth Rogen made it all the more enjoyable!  It had a wonderful ending,<br />very poignant and left a good feeling.  I watched the best parts the next night, too.<br />Maybe you have to be a parent to appreciate it this much.
B000002C4J|5.0|My sister introduced me to her music. I am sooooo thankful that she did because she knows how to touch your soul through her music.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Just sat down to watch this film with a bowl of B&J's CG in hand. Excellent combination for a fun evening.  Wanted to see Arnold kicking butt (in an age-appropriate kind of way) and delivering that dry humor of his while doing it.  Wasn't disappointed.  Supporting cast was very good, although Forest Whitaker's performance was a puzzle.  For an FBI Operations Director, he was overly emotional & repeatedly ineffectual to the point of having no credibility. Was that an accident or was it by design?  True...dumbing him down made the bad guy look unstoppable, but the writers (or the actor himself) went a bit too far with that idea. If there's a sequel, they might want to consider restructuring that part. Other than that, this film was well worth 'the price of admission'...with or without the ice cream.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Haven't seen the movie that was made but after getting through the first few pages and catching the rhythm I really enjoyed it!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I was utterly amazed by this series and I'm upset I didn't give it a try sooner. Grade A work by all involved.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|i think it's really cool!!! i love the fact that you can switch creative to survival and get supplies with out too much work the bummer is sometimes you go to that instead of achieveing it yourself.
0446547654|5.0|book was in perfect shape, great price, I was very happy with purchase!!! Hard cover books are somuch easier to read!
B00785P2QC|4.0|overall very fun but lots of goals.'follows us here. like us there. post a picture here.' but I still like thy. game. so much fun. you could say I'm addicted and be technically correct.
0345529057|5.0|These books are excellent. Awesome story and writing. I'm normally not a fan of fantasy books, but the series on HBO and it was really good.  The HBO version stays pretty true to the books.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This is one of those books that is so bad that it has gained the power to reach back in time and contaminate the earlier, better work. Not only does what passes for a plot contradict almost everything that has been built in the past, the entire book is not very well-written.<br /><br />The worst problem is not that Sookie ends up opting for a dreary life with Sam in Bon Temps where everybody still thinks she's not quite sane. I think most people saw that coming almost from the beginning, but we hoped that Ms. Harris would be able to avoid that sinkhole and come up with something clever and inventive; we hoped for something more rewarding for the poor girl who has done so much to pay for an interesting life.  At least Sam could have turned out to be more oomphy than he had seemed before. Not allowed to be independent, always defined by the man she chooses--and she must choose one--the Sookie character loses a lot of the woman she might have grown to be.<br /><br />No, the biggest problem is the careless, phoned-in quality of it. Even within this book, standing alone, the pieces never quite fit together, and the lifeless creatures that used to be delightful characters speak their forced lines with dull inevitability. All the buildup, all the adventure, all the freshness--phfftt.<br /><br />As for the story, such as it is:<br /><br />It's as if, when Hamlet approached Ophelia pretending to be mad, she had said, \\"I don't need this,\\" and run off with Horatio.<br /><br />It's as if Jack Kerouac had decided to stay at home.<br /><br />It's as if Penelope had said, \\"Eh, he's not worth waiting for; he's probably playing around anyway,\\" and picked one of the more conventional of her suitors and married him.<br /><br />It's as if Constance Chatterly had decided that even though Oliver Mellors was interesting, her husband had social standing and money and that was what really mattered after all.<br /><br />It's as if James Bond had decided that all this spy crap was damned dangerous and that it would be best if he quit and settled down to work on his real interest, cost accounting.<br /><br />It's that kind of book.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game. Keeps your fingers moving and your brain wanting to play again.  Sometimes it seems that the simple games are the most fun.
B000T45C6E|4.0|Based on a true story, Will Smith plays a down on his luck salesman, who is raising his son and attempting to turn his life around through an unpaid internship to become a stockbroker.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It's a descendent game later in the game kinda annoying until you unlock the stuff you want. But good time waster and fun
B004EYT932|3.0|This is not an easy read.  A background in economics would be helpful.  There are better books for the layperson trying to learn about financial calamities and burst bubbles.
B003XYE7R2|5.0|This was a fantastic book! I recommend it for kids ages 11 and up! I had to read this for school and I am completely satisfied!
B004W1GCQO|5.0|The entire season was exquisite.  Great storyline and compelling characters.  It's a wonderful window into pre-WWII English life.<br /><br />I loved the lighting throughout the production -- like in a fine Reubens, Rembrandt or Caravaggio.  It made the characters, set, wardrobe really shine, and set the mood to highlight the story.
B0036T31YY|4.0|I watched this a long time ago and thought I had the movie figured out.. but did not.<br /> Writing what I can without spoiling the movie.<br /> This is a dark movie and centers around a single mother.<br />The videography is very well done.<br />The acting is very good.<br />Script is pretty good, no big mistakes comes to mind.<br />I wish I could go into detail but I would wreck the movie.<br />I can say that this type of movie I can take or leave, but this movie was very well done.<br />One of the few American movies that was a vast improvement over the original European movie.<br />If you like physiological movies this is one you should consider.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Star Trek is an interesting and great set to watch together as a family. We like the bit of history they interject now and then, as well as the characters' personalities.  Each episode does give you some societal problem that must be solved usually.  We especially liked the Coms and Yangs episode and Amok Time, too. I grew up on StarTrek in the  60's and still love it!Live long and prosper!
B002ECN4P0|2.0|I was disappointed in the selection of music. It omitted some of the major hits but added some realtively uinkown songs.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|This app used to work great about 3 updates back, but now it is terrible! Shuffle just plays the same set of songs over and over despite adding new music to the library. If you skip a song, the app thinks you are still on the old song and plays the previous track from cache as the track you just skipped to. The interface is so so. I'm looking for a different app to play my music from. This one just sucks.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|An excellent selection of Phil Collins major hits throughout a long span of time. Everything you would expect to be on the cd was there.

B004V6BQ3O|4.0|We all know that the built-in mic in any camera is extremely limited. It can be adequate for general day-in-the-life video like a party or similar activity, but if you want better quality audio then you need a better microphone. There are several ways you can go, and knowing what kind of video you intend to shoot most often and how you want it to sound is an important first step in selecting a mic.<br /><br />This mic is the type usually referred to as a \\"shotgun mic\\".  It is designed to pick up sound from all directions - but focusing primarily on direct front. In other words, if you were recording at a party - the person(s) speaking directly in front of the camera (and mic) would be the primary audio, but other ambient sounds would also be recorded - like people off to the side and even behind the camera. But the ones \\"in front\\" have the most volume and clarity.<br /><br />This mic is stereo, which is nice because those ambient sounds from left and right will be recorded in stereo and sound much more natural. This also helps the ear focus on the direct front audio. It really helps to give the video some \\"audio depth\\".<br /><br />The mic is designed to ride in the hot shoe of the camera (though it is a cold device and does not use any power from the hot shoe), and tightens via a locking ring, just like a flash or similar.<br /><br />The cord is just about perfect in length. Short enough to be easy to manage and out of the way, but long enough that it should reach the connection with virtually any camera. There is even a little notch in the mic stand that will pinch the cord into place and help prevent it flopping around. I find that looping the cord once, around the stand - then plugging it in, is perfect and keeps it out of the way. I very much like that the connection is a 90-degree plug, which also helps keep it out of the way.<br /><br />The mic can also be adjusted on a swivel that moves it up and down, but only in a limited way. You can position the mic to \\"aim\\" upward or straight forward, or any angle in between. But you cannot aim it side to side. This would be a nice improvement to make.<br /><br />The mic includes a switch that alternates between \\"Flat\\" and \\"L-Clip\\". Flat is the general setting to use most of the time. L-Clip will help to reduce the buffeting noise of wind, and will also help reduce clipping when recording very loud sounds such as live rock music, etc.  For any additional sensitivity settings, you must rely on the camera's functions.<br /><br />The foam windscreen is nice, and will help to prevent some of the \\"pops\\" that can occur with close up or loud audio. There is also an optional dead-cat type wind reducer available.<br /><br />I have used this mic in several difficult and trying recordings already. One was an outdoor rally setting with loud speakers and crowd noise, in which the loud speakers were aimed away from my position, putting me in a dead spot. I raised the mic to about a 45 degree angle, and it did a pretty good job of capturing the audio of the speakers. I have also used it for recording live music, and it did a good job. For normal speaking, indoors, I find that it is effective up to about 10 feet or so. After that, you will greatly loose volume.<br /><br />For it's designed purpose, I like the ME-1 and will use it regularly. It is a huge plus that it does not require its own power source. No batteries to worry about, ever. Just keep in in the bag, and attach when needed. You could even use an extension cable and boom to move the mic closer to the subject if necessary. I have not tried that yet.<br /><br />Expensive, but still a good value I think.im\\" upward or straight forward, or any angle in between. But you cannot aim it side to side.

B00BQPEIT2|2.0|the game is fun but u need to buy coins<br /> and gems to achieve any of the somewhat higher levels. its one of those games that is frustrating because u don't earn enough gems or coins to buys power ups. so it sucks for that reason.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am so excited to have found another favorite author in the world of Science Fiction - a world that until recently I hadn't visited since I was a teen (too many years ago!).  The story, in my mind, is perfect.  The characters are rich - you follow many of them and anxiously wonder what each one of them are up to while you are reading about the other.  The author gives you just enough information so you can guess at what's happened or about to happen - but you're never quite sure, which is part of the magic of a good story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you enjoy a story filled with rich characters and descriptions of a world in which people make the very best of what they have been left with.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|UPDATED REVIEW - 10/10/13:<br />As much as I really enjoy this game, I'm going to have to put it aside. I've been playing it for about five months and have found that it simply taxes the Kindle Fire 1st edition (not the HD) to the point that it can't function. 3 out of 5 times I try to load it, it crashes upon open. The Kindle Fire gets very warm to the touch while playing, and responses as well as touch sensitivity are both considerably delayed.<br /><br />This game really belongs on a higher-capability device and when I get one, I'm happy to test it there. But if you own a Kindle Fire 1st edition, walk past this one.<br /><br />MY EARLIER REVIEW:<br />I think most of what can be said has been said. I'll. note the similarities to Magic The Gathering. The graphics and sound effects are enjoyable but seem to Max out the first generation kindle fire's capabilities. Crashes do happen with enough frequency that it does take away from the enjoyment. On its own I'd love to play on PC where the capabilities could be better handled.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am reading this one on my Kindle right now and LOVE it, the best series ever!!  With the book on Kindle I can take it anywhere and read any time I want, it's great!
B005HED11Y|5.0|HD Rocks!  I'm seeing things in a clarity that is midblowing.  I grew up watch the series in it's first run and for many years after in syndication on a old Console Maganavox B/W TV.  With this HD Version I'm noticing things and details I didn't even know existed and of course the bounus of watching the episodes UNCUT and COMPLETE.  Their are scenes I'm seeing for the first time that previously made it to the cutting room floor during syndications....AWESOME, it like seeing for the first time again!  Your you love ST:TOS and have Amazon Prime...well, it's a no brainer-Check HD out!<br /><br />Chris
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is the BEST series and I loved it!!  I had it put on my Kindle and it's been fun to carry around and just read anywhere!  Great book!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Highly recommend to fans of the show.  The storyline continues to weave intricate subplots with the case-of-the-day, making you care equally about the clients the firm's defending and the lawyers' personal lives.  Calinda's back-story provides more surprises and Alicia's complicated relationship with her husband, mother-in-law and children is brilliantly portrayed.  Can't wait to see season four!
B004ELSDZK|2.0|Eh...I downloaded this based on the great reviews. I found the game to be ok. Granted, I only played with it through level 7, but I found that I was quickly getting bored with it. To be fair, I'm not typically a fan of the bubble pop games, so it could be a good game if you do.  The graphics were nice, but I found the totem speak to get old, as he does bad grammar speak.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love this game. Certainly a game for working the brain. I can not wait for the extension to come out!
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|This game reminded me of the old school favorites!  I had a blast playing this, and I find that my husband sneaks my phone to play it too.  Very responsive controls (using touch). I can see where this game will be addictive!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Enjoyed her honesty and her courageousness. It made me want to put on my boots and hit the trails. Also, some great tips for would be hikers.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I'm enjoying the game, but think that the constant bombardment of ads in between every level PLUS the start screen is very poor form for a paid application.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|The item arrived in poor condition at the first time. Second time, it came fine. I have played the CD's and there is nothing wrong with it. CD does not have scratches. They seem brand new as described.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I was captivated by this book and couldn't put it down, though at times I skimmed through the heavier dialect choices and descriptions. It did drag on through some of the Lavinia chapters, but on the whole a great book.
B00000IMTF|4.0|I received this item in good condition. It came wrapped in shrink wrap as it was described. I played the CD and there is nothing wrong with it. I am very happy with this purchase.
0345803493|1.0|I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG AND IT IS NOT HERE YET. I NEED THIS BOOK. I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS TRILOGY AND IT HASN'T ARRIVED YET. VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTMENT.... !_!
B000002GK1|4.0|I received this item in good condition. It came wrapped in shrink wrap as it was described. I played the CD and there is nothing wrong with it. I am very happy with this purchase.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|I rilly dont like this game. If you like flying games this game is for you. it is all about the rill thing if you were flying you dont want to hit any thing. If you do you get damage and at the same time you have to hit targets. The grafecks are good though .
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Season 8 is one of the best seasons of Supernatural yet. This is one of my most favorite TV shows of all time, and this season has really brought it in terms of action and character development. Jeremy Carver has done a great job of raising the show to a whole 'nother level. Can't wait for season 9!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Just started reading Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch stories (in order). This was the best so far. Excellent. Looking forward to the next.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Would only show practice sessions, not the game itself.  Them kept repeating the same one.  Disappointing was looking forward to playing the game.
B001FSDOZO|1.0|This album sucks.  its not good music dark horse has a few decent riffs but noone likes to hear about sex nonstop chad kroger is a selfish dumb sex greased redneck. they need to learn how to write real music \\"deryck Whibley\\". now bands like sum 41 and weezer have real genuine music. they acually write about life storys and mood influenced rifss. rivers cuomo could kill chad kroger. chad kroger is just dumb in so many ways
B004SIIBGU|4.0|like this app!!! it lets me know when my bids are out bid plus my hobby is to find the best magic cards for my deck that i can to really tweek it to its true potential this way i might enter some tournaments and win.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|SO ADDICTIVE!! Play every day even when the Internet is down. You can play with or without internet. Haven't tried the multiplayer yet though.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Saw it twice, Lots of action. Never a slow or dull moment. I don't usually watch Tom Cruise movies but this one is an exception. I  might  try another one.
B008GGA5EQ|5.0|GIRL TRADE is an extremely well penned full length novel that resides in a class of its own. The author, CHLOE THURLOW is a literary genius disguised as a workaday writer of erotica. This is a multifaceted novel in the style of an action adventure; physically and emotionally.  The complex story is woven through the bent perceptions of a young lady as she morphs into a woman and finally an adult. Believable characters are fully developed and the exposition is extraordinary.<br />This novel will stir your juices but will not degrade you in the manner of most `slap and tickle' mediums.<br />Absolutely compelling -- character definition, introspection, plots and subplots; a total package with an honest presentation. Five stars and `hats off' to Chloe Thurlow.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is one of the best websites ever created! I hope they continue to improve, and that they stay around forever.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Couldn't put down, and couldn't stop giggling. Great love story! Loved every single word, the braveheart references especially! Thank you for this wonderful book.
193700788X|1.0|I feel like I've been duped.  There are so many inconsistencies, the characters I've come to know and love aren't behaving themselves, too many questions are unanswered (some important issues are left hanging), Sookie world's rules are changed at CH's whim.  Thus, I find myself EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!  CH didn't do the SVM series justice at all. What a wretched way to end something that was sooo loved!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is awesome to play it is fun I play alot at the start on survival it'skinda hard at night creative is cool so is survival minecraft is awesome.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This show is absolutely Awesome sauce that is all. Make sure after you finish this series to watch the movie Serenity to get some closure.
B008Y7IP0S|4.0|Saw this when it was first released.  Love it then, enjoyed it now.  A sign of my aging.  It does have some good lessons to teach to the young.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I've tried several different meditation, sound sleep app's<br />this one is hands down the best one I've found and it's the free app of the day. Great job developer's and thanks amazon.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|Great story and great acting.  Saw this years ago and enjoyed as much this time as I did in the past.  Barbra Streisand is the perfect actress for this role.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|I remember seeing a preview before this came out and I was put off by the title, but it is so funny. If you love Paul Rudd buy this now!!!!
B00932A4XE|3.0|This was not what I was expecting.  Good no brainer movie for something to watch when you don't know what to watch.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I love this cd. it gets back to Rod's rock and roll days. it puts me in a really good mood when I listen to it, especially the song titled Beautiful Morning. If you love Rod, you will love this cd!
B0095P33IW|4.0|Very enjoyable.  Had not seen this one before and wasn't sure what to expect.  It was very good and I would watch again.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am not a bit FB user but having all of the web on my Kindle adds to its versatility,
B003ELKNH2|2.0|It's an interesting but ponderous movie that lost me about halfway through it.  It's well made and the photography and cinematography are first class though.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|This movie just drug on, it was not near as funny as I was expecting, the key components were all used up in the advertisements, maybe just me, but i would not have spent .99¢ on it, would have had just as many laughs or more watching Faux News.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This was a gift for my wife.  She has long been a fan of the Hobbit stories and books so this was a great treat for her.  She and I both loved the movie.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Very engaging story. This is a cliff hanger with many more unanswered questions than answers. I hope Mr. Martin gets the next volume out soon.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a great challenging game. Especially when you have the timer on. My husband is hooked on it too.
B00AR83PN4|3.0|like this game okay. I just wish there was a little more to it. Wish it had better directions. not what I expected
B00A2FSSHK|4.0|I saw this movie before long time ago and was looking for an option to see it again. Nothing out of the ordinary, but entertaining enough that I do not regret ordering it
B00COMLLX2|5.0|Great graphics and a lot of fun.  Love it on the go when I'm not playing pinball fx on my Xbox 360.
B003CBVU30|1.0|I think this is more a case of a bad movie than just a movie that hasn't aged well. The only funny thing about this movie is how old all the actors are who play high school students. I love newer WillFerrell movies like Anchorman, Elf & Step Brothers, this one severely dissapoints.
B00BGPKCO2|5.0|Experiencing life through the mind of an autistic child was very interesting. I found myself worrying about him and rooting for his success.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Just started. Seems like fun. In agreement with other reviewers, the social media requirements are drudgery. I may update this post after playing more.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Very descriptive writing and language of that time.  Started out slow but by the end you could not put it down in anticipation of how it was to end.
B0099114WO|5.0|I saw this and cried it is really well done couple flick if your in any relation ship even Happy it would be a good thing to watch with your partner! It reminds us all we have to work on relationships before it is too late! Two very fine artist s
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Loved it. If you like history this movie is excellent at telling the story and giving a living idea of how live was back then.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Perfect action packed movie with the right amount of chases, drama, and suspense.  Held my attention through the whaole movie, which is hard to do.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Informative, sometimes difficult to stomach, we as consumers should know where our grocery store foods come from. It will change your life if you allow it to. If not, eating without any discretion will kill us. If you care, watch, learn, and react. To your health!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Imagine how wonderful it is to carry your Kindle books with you on every device you own. This is reading Heaven!
B005IQZB14|5.0|To consider such an amazing journey all alone is, or was, impossible. To consider it now is more attainable and less at the same time. Each step of Cheryl' s journey mirrors a journey we all must take to achieve growth, but each person's path, choices, and difficulties they must bear are deeply personal. \\"Wild\\" is written to share one woman's story of transcendence and I thank the author for her willingness to go there with and for us.
B009T9P7OC|5.0|It plays files that Google music does not. It also has a great equalizer. Shape the sound the way you like it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Love it use it for everything. Great for wanting quick answers or having to do research with the kids. Perfect
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|If you love classic Maeve, you will love this book. Multiple characters, interwoven plots all wrapped up in a well written book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an exciting book full of lots of surprises! I would definitely recommend this book, it was a quick read and surprising right up to the end!
B009PNQUXO|1.0|I can't view from my account....deleting! This really sucks. Can't find an app for YouTube to save my life. Get real y'all! Since I have to say more let me just say I hate hate hate this app. Put a real app on here. Get it right. Fix it.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|In a masterful, sometimes playful way, Gladwell proposes that we take a look &#34;under the hood&#34; our of cognitive processes. Good reading that prompts some much needed questioning for our current day society. Examples abound along with scientific research.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down.....very good.  I'm not a big reader but this series has me staying awake til 1 or 2 reading.
B005OYKI1I|4.0|If you're a FF fan, you'll find this movie a great step upand a from the previous episodes. Great fun, great cast, entertaining all the way.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I am impressed that this movie could tell a great story, develop multi-dimensional characters, and offer a window on the world of an alcoholic, as well as a window on the world of a recovering alcoholic - in such a short time frame. Denzel never fails to deliver a clearly complicated character. No one walking the earth is any less than a complicated mixture of strengths and frailties, should we ever doubt that, and despite our lowest iniquities, we are capable of redemption. Denzel's masterful portrayal of Whip Whitaker assures us of that.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This portable amp is very tiny, and easy to carry. Long battery life. Great price. (Compared to others I've researched.)<br />I have found this doesn't improve certain types of much as much as others. Rock/metal, for example, is around 20% better, but trance and dubstep is off the charts.<br />Two more things to consider if you buy this and eagerly plug in hoping for a mind blowing upgrade is: Headphones. Do you have great headphones? $100 plus? If so, that will enhance this product even further.<br />And the recording quality of the music. Mp3 is nice, but it's not perfect. If you aren't already familiar, look up lossless compression on Wiki. Read about how compression works and conversely, doesn't work.<br />Now, when I search for music, I look for lossless ONLY. That, plus the FiiO, and good headphones are how to get the most out of your listening experience.
B006J420UE|5.0|I've had this processor for over a year now, it has lived up to my expectations.<br />This processor is meant for low budget gaming builds, it outperforms Intel's processors integrated graphics HD 3000 by 220% and HD 4000 by 150% (This is based on benchmark values tested by PassMark) and its price is lower than the [[ASIN:B004JEVGMO Intel Core i3-2100 Dual-Core Processor 3.1 GHz 3 MB Cache LGA 1155 - BX80623I32100]] processors, thus providing the best performance to cost ratio.<br /><br />This processor was used in my HTPC build and has been working like an ox. It can take on my 40\\" inch Samsung TV 1080p display and steam 1080p effortlessly.<br />I have tested and played the following games:<br />1) Minecraft - Played flawlessly<br />2) Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 - Set at 1080p this game did not cause any lag with the processor<br />3) Battlefield Bad Company 2 - Could not take up 1080p (18 FPS) had to lower it around 1336 x 768;<br /><br />The heat sink that came with it is good and I would not recommend buying a separate one; unless you're overclocking...<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Just for the Heads up<br /><br />Do not buy this processor! since this is the old generation, buy the current generation of these processors [[ASIN:B0095VP8D4 AMD A10-5800K APU 3.8Ghz Processor AD580KWOHJBOX]] And if you wait for a little longer the next will come out soon!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|It was very nice to watch with the 3D glasses. It met my expectation. It was worth every Dime that I paid for it. No regrets. Even. my grandkids enjoyed
B001N4OX82|5.0|Very nice movie , I loved it , it was a good price and easy to start watching it on my computer .
1607066017|3.0|I enjoyed this.  Let's get that out of the way.<br /><br />But it lost me at it's cliched over-reactions, the watered down culture clash between the protagonists and the baby that's more prop than emotional center or character, even with the narration.  Yes, I understand it's a baby.  I still don't care about her much, and I want to.  It still does a lot right.  From the world building to the bulk of the characters, I find myself interested in the story and the setting.  Oddly, the most emotional moment of the series (this trade anyway) is the death of a villain.  I didn't see that coming.  The most infuriating part comes at the end of this book.  But ultimately that shows that Vaughan got me to care about the characters.<br /><br />Vaughan still has the power to surprise and delight, and he's still a great writer, I just don't find this to be his best work.  Check out Runaways or Pride of Baghdad or Y: the Last Man for that (I'm not familiar with the entire scope of his work - I'm sure you'll cope).  If you like quirky space opera with a unique premise, this is a good read, though.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Some of the acting leaves a little to be desired.....very predictable reactions to issues. Although, the concept is quite interesting.
B0046MOVD0|3.0|This is basically Resident Evil: the Matrix.  The opening sequence and the final sequence really channel the stylistic over the top action of the Matrix films while having none of their gravitas or aspirations.  The zombie deaths are both predictable and boring (based almost entirely on archetype).  If I wasn't just a zombie and Milla fan, I'd probably be sad I lost time watching this.  As it stands, I still liked it.  I just recognize that it sucks.  =)<br /><br />I hear the next one does a lot of retcon.  But that's okay.  I'll watch it.  I like pain.
034580404X|5.0|they were great, I read all of the in one month, I was not able to put the book's down until I finish them.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|imagine a movie that combines the innocence of The Goonies, the honesty of Broadcast News, the absurdity of One Hot American Summer, and the purity of Harold and Maude and you get one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.  While I anticipate all his future endeavors, this film will forever resonate as his definitive work, in my book. Thank you, Wes!<br /><br />charlie
B000GFLKF8|5.0|Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Jodi Foster and rest of cast, fantastic.  Suspenseful to beat all, but I watch it over an over because I like to see the details of how they pulled this off.
B00514HDNW|5.0|Interesting reading the original novel to the story.  Saw the movie first and decided to read it.  Glad I read it.  Much more developed in the relationship between zombies.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Can't stop watching this show, so good! Episodes are long (90 minutes), but so worth it! Watch now! (Good acting, plot, etc)
B008220DIC|4.0|First off, this film is unbelievably gorgeous. Shot on 65mm, it really is a cinematic experience that deserves large format projection. I was lucky enough to see it in the theater that way and it really is glorious.<br /><br />This is a very challenging work and that is why I appreciate it so much. P.T. Anderson, for whatever flaws his films have, is digging deep into the American psyche, peeling back the layers of myth, and discovering what is really there. The hype suggests this film is about scientology, but this is really a look at a post-war America discovering its psychological troubles. The Master explores the untold stories of the difficulties Americans faced after the war, not just a decade of optimistic consumerism, but also one with many folks dealing with the aftermath of war trauma and economic difficulties.<br /><br />Phoenix is incredible, making an unappealing individual incredibly real and believable and Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers a stunning performance to match. The images and their performances are riveting.<br /><br />Where the film breaks down for me is where every P.T. Anderson film breaks down, the end. He makes novel-length works, and not a simple novel, but big, thick book works. And here again he fast forwards in time with major off-screen events changing characters' lives. I was confused by the end because I hadn't realized how much time had jumped, what had or hadn't happened off screen. And though there is something compelling about the performance of the conclusion, it is distanced from what came before. Arbitrary.<br /><br />The movie said what it needed to say in the first half, or 2/3rds and after that point had nothing new to offer. Were that not the case, this would be a 5 star and one of the great pieces of cinema of all-time. Anderson's control over the camera and image is nothing short of brilliant. Witness the sequence where Phoenix is taking photos in the mall, with the camera moving with him as the scene plays out for something truly stunning. When it comes to completing the film's story however, Anderson lets us down. Nevertheless, this is still a powerful, deep and fascinating film.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The storyline was thought-provoking and deep. However, the way it was written warranted three stars. It was a little juvenile and was written in present tense. (I am not a fan of novels written completely in present tense.) Overall, not bad.
B001APJYMY|5.0|I used to listen to this album all the time when it came out on cassette as a teen in the 90s. Been thinking a lot about it lately, so I just had to have it again. So happy I bought this album as mp3.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this is a awesome app you would get it people!! I love this app it is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo awesome Get It please people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you guys rock
0805053883|5.0|My 2 month old loves this book.  I ended up ordering many others just like it.  He loves the big pictures and it fits in the diaper bag.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a wonderful game. The graphics are outstanding. The rewards are cool. It is an overall game success. I play it every day I never get third of it.
0694013013|5.0|My 2 month old loves this book.  I ended up ordering many others just like it.  He loves the big pictures and it fits in the diaper bag.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|LOVE THE SIZE O IT.<br />fills up the whole screen and it even adds correctly so it get 5 stars
0805047905|5.0|My 2 month old loves this book.  I ended up ordering many others just like it.  He loves the big pictures and it fits in the diaper bag.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie, and I want my husband to see it and some of my friends too.  I plan to watch it again, and I would really enjoy seeing a sequel.  It is refreshing to see such a high quality movie, both from a storyline and cinematography perspective.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|my wife and I have been using the relax and sleep app for quite some time now and have been very pleased with it, up until now it was the only application that actually had realistic sound effects and you could set a timer. Well it now has a suitable replacement and is very attractive. The sound effects are very realistic and have more than just a 4 second loop. The graphics in the display are very pretty to look at and all the sound effect combinations are easy to set up. All in all this is the best ambient sound application that I have used thus far. The only thing I would add to this is, for the timer to show the actual time instead of a countdown, ie like the timer works in the relax and sleep app. :-)<br />besides that this is the greatest ambien app ever created good job developers, I will add the extra star when you make the countdown show the actual time, makes it easier for setting up sleep time. :-)
B00B9LNJ9I|3.0|I loved her other albums, This one is just okay. I'll think again before I order anymore from her without hearing it first.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|...unless you don't watch from season 1 episode 1.  By far the best series on TV and will continue to be the best!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I love this version of Emma. Romola Garai plays so well as the unofficial &#34;matchmaker&#34; to her friends and family. So wonderful to finally see her fall in love for herself.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|Did not like how the portrayal of the Joker was handled, he was just a punk that wore makeup. Nickelson  did it better.
B009AMANBA|3.0|I found it slow moving.  I had trouble really understanding all that was said, politics got tough to follow & I am a political junkie.  I enjoyed the acting, very good.  I will watch it another time & hope I find it more likeable.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|Excellent show, haven't missed an episode since the series started. I would highly recommend this to people that like this type of show
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I did not like the &#34;sing-speak&#34;. Either sing or say it!  I had really not known anything about the story so was glad to understand it.  I thought the actors were great.
B007VTUYWW|3.0|This was a fine film for a bit off fun. If you're looking for something deep don't bother. I liked it!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful!  I watched it once at the theater & once at home.  At home watched w/ subtitles, I find it so helpful to do this when watching something from Britain.  This will be a movie I will watch many times.
B007SGM084|4.0|This was a great book...kept me engaged in reading it. I'm reading it for the second time now. Great book.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Terrific cinematography, excellent writing, and extremely well acted.  I won't try to tell you what it is about outside of the fact that it is well worth watching, and then maybe re-watching.  My comment about it not being about math (the irrational number &#34;pi&#34;, is mostly true; it's the main character's name or nickname, at least.  All I can say, is please take the time to sit, watch the story unfold, and then make up your own mind what it is about.  Could be several depending on the viewer. but keep your mind open.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|Lot of action and a good story line.  I liked how he just shows up as if he is telepathic.
B00APAENUI|5.0|Mr. Weber is a most prolific writer (several series & collaborations) but his Honor Harrington books are his highest achievement in my opinion.  I find it easiest when dealing with a long series, to start at the beginning and move forward in chronological order and this book really needs the continuity of the past history to see how the character arrives at the time of this narrative.  There are several more books beyond this one and the story has not yet finished, but that is one of the things that I love about a storyline where I get to know and root for (or despise) the various characters.  Mr. Weber is also quite good at weaving in parallels to &#34;real&#34; Earth history and for someone like myself, former oceangoing serviceman and history buff, enjoy the various allusions.  All I  can say to the reader, is I hope you enjoy both this book and the series as much as I have.
B00005JLT5|4.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Reality being what it is, this movie recreates the harsh reality of the very bad conditions of war and survival by one man. Great acting; sad; riveting.
1936594625|5.0|Referring to the tragedy of Oscar Wilde, I once asked my Aunt Moira when was the first time she heard his name.  She answered that she was staying with a friend, Christine Cahill, and her family for a summer on their farm in Co. Kildare.  Christine's mother turned to her father at the table, and said with a shudder:  'Not in front of the children!'.  My aunt went on, with a wry smile, to add that naturally the grown-ups now had secured all the children's full attention, and years later she was reading everything about this famous author and everything that he had written.<br /><br />Earlier today, while enjoying Irish weather in New York, I was thinking of what Wilde had to say about his countrymen.  Every milligram an Irishman himself in spite of being 100 English percent by blood, he was reported to have observed on quitting Dublin that it was bad enough to live with your own faults without seeing them reflected around you, and then I started remembering his famous \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\".  Occasionally one comes across a book that leaves a lasting impact on one's mind for the duration of a lifetime, and it crops up at the most curious of times.  Oscar Wilde's classic is such a one for this reader.<br /><br />Literary critics have, and will continue to say much about this masterpiece perhaps for generations to come, while I will address just one theme among many of the story:  while you are remaining curiously young and ageless to your friends and the world at large, your aging portrait hidden from all eyes is inspected by you alone as the years go by, with some trepidation as the case may be.  Not only is your true appearance accurately portrayed in the picture, showing your actual physical age, but revealing in great detail your personality along with your good deeds and misdemeanors, etched meticulously across the painting. When friends of mine sent word recently saying:  'Expect us to look younger since you saw us a decade ago!', I was quick to respond: 'I fully expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here'.  Although this was meant as a note of humor on my part, the thought of Wilde's great novel came to mind immediately, and there was a slight chill in the air.<br /><br />As for the author's creation of Dorian Gray, when eternally young Gray attempts to alter and amend his portrait, or his 'soul', I shall leave new readers to discover the results of such an enterprise for themselves.  A powerful and magnificent novel by one of the greatest literary figures of all times.lly expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here'.

B000087F6M|5.0|Legal Eagles is a very entertaining movie. I would recommend it to young adults, which I was when I first saw it (I think) LOL or to the more mature.
B000BH4YJ0|5.0|This album was quite a nice surprise...I love all of the songs but the first one is just awesome!!<br />Thank you Luis!!
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Amazing disc.  Besides the quality of seeming to be at the concert, They play all their classic hits with a couple of new ones added for additional entertainment!<br /><br />Great present for any fan of music.
B00CC1JXYE|4.0|Ordered this cover due to other favorable reviews.  In the unit initially shipped to me, the plastic insert that cradles the phone was misaligned vis-a-vis the surrounding leather, so that the cover would not close squarely and the camera hole and other openings were out of place.  Returned the first unit and ordered a second, which arrived in fine shape. The cover is well designed and highly functional, and protects the phone well. Its lightly pebbled leather surface provides some useful anti-slip texture. Would strongly recommend, provided that it's carefully checked over before being accepted.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|I still love this show! It is going on a bit long but it still delivers belly laughs!  I am ready for him to meet the Mother!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is my second book by Baldacci and he had me hooked from the beginning! I would recommend this book to anyone who like federal agency mystery thrillers without all of the technical stuff. I can't wait to read The Hit next since I finished this book within a day and a half.
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|This movie is just as good now as the day it was originally released.  Now I get to watch it with my son.  It's his favorite movie!  Can't go wrong with this one!

B004EPZ07K|5.0|Bought for my better half. He has enjoyed watching this. Seller shipped quick and I even got to hide it he didn't know anything about this one. Got one on him. Thanks five stars.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|We have been having a lot of &#34;power bumps&#34; in our area and this flashlight has proven to be invaluable when you are stumbling around in the dark. Thanks.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Everytime I play it I hear another great song. Hit after, after hit after hit. At first I thought it was the machine behind her but she really has talent!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Love this CD. I forgotten how much I liked Boz Scaggs. This CD is a mixture of new and old songs. If you like the &#34; Lido Shuffle&#34; you'll love MEMPHIS!
B002PMV9K6|5.0|The Harry Potter books are so detailed that it was hard for me to imagine that the movies would be able to live up to them. But they have and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was no exception. The actors do an excellent job portraying their characters and keep the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout the film.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The acting was great. The visual effects were really good. I truly enjoyed the movie as much as i enjoyed the book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not usually a big fan of zombie things. In fact, I almost didn't give this show a chance because of it, but this is a really good show. Well written, well acted, good story line. Totally entertaining.
B005CRQ2DK|2.0|Hey  my name is Adanna Tymofichuk and I loved this book it is the most important book to me that makes me just say it is a article that all people who want to read this book can read this  book so it is ok if our life is different than others because everybody is  different from other countries and others who do different types of things·
B000OV85AW|5.0|My favorite film<br /><br />Though the part at the boat, the sound was mixed differently than my old VHS and it was hard to discern what they were saying<br />Only for about a 4-min scene though, otherwise perfection
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is great and makes you never want to stop playing<br />I would like to see and play more games like this<br />It is good for the brain
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|My wife and I really like this show and consider Holmes and Watson to be very well portrayed.  It's especially interesting that Holmes, brilliant as he is, is such a vulnerable, and I guess, all-too-human, figure, an unusual thing given his soaring intellect and obviously well-honed perception.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I liked this one because of both the acting and the cinimatography.  It would be nice to see a sequil to it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love playing Mahjong I having been playing for years on my computer, know I will enjoy it on my Kindle Fire.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Frank McCourt's honest yet non-vindictive reflections on the challenges and triumphs of his childhood touch upon experiences encountered by many children of that  war-time era, particularly those raised in poverty.  Facing nearly impossible odds and heart-aches most of us can't even imagine, a small boy finds his way to manhood and the promise of a better tomorrow with the help of family wit and wisdom, and the angel on the seventh stair-step.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Anyone who likes multigenerational sagas will love this book. From the first book of the chronicles to the &#34;Best Kept Secret,&#34; you will not want to put it down till you have finished it. And there is more to come!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|If you love their music on YouTube you will love this collection.  When the package came in, I threw the DVD version in the player and everyone enjoyed it.  Then we put the CD in and let it run in the background....everyone enjoyed!  I think I may pick up some more as gifts.
B009NY43NY|5.0|One of the best of the Sookie series!!!!! It was truly a great<br />read.  I couldn't put it down..absolutely wonderful.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I watched the entire 2 hour and 51 minute presentation because I love &#34;across the centuries&#34; sagas and this one was easy to watch. Following it was another matter entirely. By the time the credits rolled, I could not tell you anything about what I just watched. The story never gained traction in my mind, and I tried, and I get most stuff. But again, it was so easy on the eyes, I just stayed put, as did my mind.
B000J2BRQU|5.0|After I watched Fast & Furious 6, I had to watch Tokyo Drift the same weekend. I'm glad amazon has its own app for the Playstation 3. Super easy to rent movies.
B007Y36K46|4.0|A wonderful screen adaptation of the sci-fi classic by E.R. Burroughs. Unfortunately the lead actor´s face and voice grated on my nerves and showed none of the warm intensity of the John Carter from the books (The Chronicles of Mars). I will watch it again, nevertheless, because the Tharks and the Barsoom creatures are wonderful!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Readers beware. If you dislike great books that occasionally bring you to tears and fill you with emotion, don't buy this book.  If you despise books that have beautifully quirky characters and tell stories of youthful romances then you should quickly leave this page.  If however, you enjoy these feelings and types of books then please read this.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|I loved it because of the time frame(mine)  and the music is  wonderful..... I wasn't looking for any deep meaning .
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a really good game. They need to make getting the gems easier but other then that its good.
B006O3MU96|3.0|my 8yr old loves this game its good for about 5-18 its adicting its very fun for me to and im 24
B000W178XO|5.0|Awesome some old classics and some newer stuff. Everyone will love this one. I highly recommend if you like Johnny Cash.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Twyla is a terrific color combination of pastel mint green and lilac and purple blue with smokey snakey swirls that form skin gloves and strange tattoo/stockings--love her outfit and her pet dust bunny--plus her eyes glow in the dark after exposure to light!!  I wish they had drawn some of the swirly lines on her face and made those glow, too, but...also how about making the bunny glow?<br /><br />I am a fan of the pet line of dolls vs. the ones that come with electronic accessories but that is just a to each his own thing.  You can also get these dolls at a great price at monsterhighexpress.com and free shipping on any amount purchased for a limited time--it is run by parents and is a licensed Mattel dealer!  Another winning combo.
B005PK1G76|4.0|This works very well on my stroller that has a cup holder that always falls off. I have been able to fit all my drinks but I don't usually order any Jumbo drinks mostly bottled water.
B003L7DK74|5.0|I absolutely love this show!  This collection comes with all seasons and some bonus material also.  The DVD jacket is clear with just the images of Bret and Jermaine, and the actual DVD cover itself has the city outline.  It creates a very cool 3D effect.<br /><br />The series itself follows two New Zealand men aspiring to become famous musicians in New York.  The show is mostly about trying to just survive in New York with the help of their talent agent, Murray, and self-proclaimed biggest fan/stalker, Mel.  There are many comedic musical breaks during all the episodes that deals whatever current awkward situation(s) they are dealing with.  Bret and Jermaine's music is very catchys (one of my favorite songs is &#34;Too Many D*cks on the Dance Floor&#34; - Season 2, Episode 5... hilarious!).<br /><br />The show has very awkward humor - and is very funny to watch!  If you are a fan of this show, this is a must have for your collection.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Great series and would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years  I gave it a five star rating
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I'm giving this Blu-ray \\"5 stars,\\" just for the included portion of a concert from 1977.  Only eight songs are presented, but they are played so well, that I doubt they weren't \\"enhanced\\" in the studio.  I don't really care.  It's just so good, especially when Meisner sings \\"Take it to the Limit.\\"<br /><br />I read \\"Heaven and Hell,\\" and now I've seen this, which I suppose is the laziest way Frey can get back at Felder.  Judging by the interviews, Bernie Leadon seems to be the most honest one in the bunch.  You can tell he just doesn't care, and he's not trying to slant anything.  Frey, seems up front about some things, but his ego is so gargantuan that he thinks all his boasting is true.  Felder wishes Frey wasn't an arrogant ahole, Henley was careful with what he said, Meisner and Schmidt are barely in it.<br /><br />The truth seems to be that Frey is an a-hole.  What I gather about the \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" reunion, is that Felder wanted a fifth of the band, and Frey wanted a greater cut of the profits for himself and Henley.  His reasons seemed to be that the two of them had more successful solo careers since they left the Eagles.  By that reasoning, Henley should have gotten half of everything, then a little bit more for Joe Walsh, third on the list would be Frey, then Felder, and Schmidt in 5th place.  Come on!  If we're gonna divide it up that way, then let's be more precise.  Frey is just an egomaniac.  He was important in the Eagles.  Outside the Eagles, he's just as pointless as Felder.  \\"You belong to the City,\\" and \\"Smuggler's Blues\\" do not put him in Henley's league.  No effing way.  And talk about successful outside the Eagles, look at Joe Walsh.<br /><br />The reason why Frey is full of it is that all members of a band contribute, and money issues will always break them apart if they start trying to measure the impact of each individual member on the group.  The point is this.  The Eagles were a great band before Don Felder (of course that band includedMeisner and Leadon who Frey wants to forget ever existed) but they became superstars when Felder submitted \\"Hotel California.\\"  Without that song, the Eagles would NEVER have gotten the fame and money they currently enjoy.  \\"Hotel California\\" as far as I'm concerned makes Felder a permanent EQUAL member of the Eagles.  But, you know what...Schmidt, Walsh too.  Those guys are up on stage working at every show.  WTF Frey????!?!?!!<br /><br />It's funny to me, when I hear Frey or Henley say a band is not a democracy, or you can't have five leaders of a band.  Yes that's fine, but you also can't have five drummers.  You never hear this kind of crap coming out of the members of RUSH who respect each other.  I loved it when he remarked on Felder wanting to be the vocalist for a song (I think it was \\"Victim of Love\\") and Henley said, \\"Felder singing Victim of Love, would be like me playing lead guitar on Hotel California.\\"  I don't get that.  Then, why is Joe Walsh singing \\"Pretty Maids All in a Row\\"?  I love Joe Walsh as a vocalist, and I love that song.  But, Henley's analogy is off.  Walsh doesn't have a pretty voice; not as pretty as Henley's.  But, then who does...besides Meisner?<br /><br />But, I'm not trying to make this a Felder vs. Frey thing.  I love the music of the Eagles.  All of it.  And, even though there's an obvious slant in the way this documentary is presented, I don't mind.  I love the old interviews, footage, and real history.  Of course, they don't cover much on the musical beginnings of Felder, Meisner, Leadon or Schmidt; hell, they say more about Linda Ronstadt.  But, the live concert from 1977 (as short as it is) is awesome.
0783225482|5.0|I would recommend this dvd to people over 16 years it is very funny and humerous. I gave it five stars
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I love it! I spend hours playing and trying to get all the stars. It's great for passing time and it's fun! I don't have any glitches or errors as of yet. =)
B003PGNBO8|5.0|Great series I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years and have given it a five star rating
B009NY43NY|3.0|I loved this series it was funny and exciting and kind of creepy. I will miss Skokie like the loss of a distant friend
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Great series, love the characters and the dynamics of all of them together.  Love this series.  Will be sad when it ends.  Hard to find good tv shows anymore.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I thought it was pretty well done considering it was a hidden objects game.  I may just have to try a few more of these.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I like the story line, but don't care for Seth Rogen.  I wanted it to be funnier than it actually was.  Glad I didn't pay to see it at the movie theater.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is an amazing writer!  I don't just read his books I live them.  I have to go and read his other books again to decide which is my favorite!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Good movie, made me really think about things.  Thought it was a kids movie but there is some pretty deep stuff that a kid wouldn't understand.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is so well done, it's amazing. Highly customizable! Able to get just the &quot; right&quot; mixture of sound that relaxes you.
B006OV7RQ4|5.0|i thought the acting all around was great with elizabeth olson, john hawks, sara paulson. i really enjoyed the movie because it showed how a fragile mind can get so twisted how paranoid a bad situation can make you question every thing.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Of course season 3 was just a wonderful as season 1 and 2. My DVD was sent safe and fast. You must have the season 3 to continue enjoyment.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love always having something I like to read at my fingertips. While waiting in the doctor's office or any other appt, I can just open one of my books on Kindle for Android and read away. The app was easy to download. I can shop for books right from my android cell phone. I'd highly recommend this.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is pretty fun. The \\"no more move\\" appears a little to often in the higher levels. Which also bothers the heck out of me.... it should be no more move\\"s\\", drives me crazy!
B002WV5A9G|3.0|This movie was still pretty good -<br />Kirk and Spock are entertaining as young people.<br />Not a bad way to spend $5 and a few hours.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Given that we have seen the original stars of Star Trek get older and older over the intervening years of sequels, it is quite logical that they would have to go to the early beginnings of the life of Spock and Kirk in order to make a new dynamic movie.  The producers have done remarkably well and the new Spock is almost a dead ringer for the old Spock.  Thumbs up for this movie. It is actually a better movies than the sequel now paling in theaters.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|You choose to call ads &#34;recommendations&#34; but they're nothing more than junk mail that I'm getting in my face every single time I turn on the device. Then you tell me to pay fifteen dollars to remove them. I'm returning this device and going with a Google or Microsoft product since I can't stand Apple either. I bought this at Best Buy for full price, not online for a reduced one. There was no reason to force me to ads on my home screen AND in your app store. What is the point? I mean other than corporate greed and your  want to make an extra buck off of people who can't stand it. If rather see a picture of my family on my lock page. This is just bad.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This film written and those of the military being filmed for this is amazing to see some of the discipline and real life portrayal of some of the most courageous and brave individuals on this planet, very telling the strength that is required to fight for Liberty and to keep America free, hopefully there will be a day when everyone truly opens their eyes as well as their hearts and minds and become aware of the treasure of life, and how all this material illusion is only temporal and meaningless without the qualities of Integrity, Truth, and Honor. To all the valiant soldiers of the U.S. military and the military of our allies, you are appreciated<br />  Thank You,<br />  Jerry Jay Hanson
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Daft punk's use of real instruments was great.  This is a perfect record to listen to while cruising in your car.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|And as Amazon's free app of the day it's an excellent choice... You can mix sounds to achieve the best white noise you desire to relax or go to sleep to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|alsome lovein it good hate when . i loose but i still love it hhhhhhhvvhvvvv in ch Hauch hoff fc hd hd hd g hdgdl durchs nothing more
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I devoured (heh) this book overnight. The unique format really added to the story.I literally could not put it down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|want a cool building or killing game buy this! THE GAME IS GREAT AND 7.0 IS ALMOST HERE (WHICH MEANS SOME KID IN CANADA CAN PLAY WITH SOMEONE IN AUSTRAILIA)!<br />MINECRAFT FOREVER
B00190N4E4|5.0|BEN KINGSLEY'S PORTRAYAL OF GHANDI WAS AMAZING.  I FOUND THE TREATMENT OF THE NATIVE PEOPLE OF INDIA IN THOSE TIMES WAS APPALLING AND WELL BROUGHT OUT IN THIS FILM.  IT WAS WORTH SPENDING THE THREE HOURS AND SOME MINUTES OF MY TIME TO BE REMINDED OF THE INHUMANITIES THAT UNFORTUNATELY STILL GO ON IN SOME PLACES IN THE WORLD.  WILL WE EVER LEARN?
B009T8XBBO|4.0|I enjoyed game lots of fun and it was free too.There were times that I couldn't do anything and would have to sit and wait that is the only part of game I disliked
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Enough said.  Helen Mirren is stunning as is the rest of the cast.  This is a 'don't miss' FOR SURE
B004UID2LC|1.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire HD, thinking that this would be a very good youtube downloader app. Well I was wrong,absolutely doesn't do anything for me. And always shuts down,bumps back to the homepage. If this is a bug, I suggest it gets fixed asap. Because other than that, I use silk, or have to watch YouTube on the web. Very poor score, not even one star.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|Playing for Change is keeping it real by showcasing some of the most phenomenal musicians from around the world. The clop shot in Colombia, containing over 80 musicians from various regions of the country, is by far my favorite, and the reason I picked this up. But all of the other clips are supremely entertaining and well-produced, and allow some insight into some of the world's best contemporary music, across a variety of genres.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Like other reviewers have said, this is not too childish but still appropriate for younger gamers.  Cool story line and the art is amazing.  Thank Heavens for amazon coins so I could unlock the rest of the game :-)
B00005JM0B|4.0|I wanted this movie to complete my collection of the Terminator series. I am recovering from surgery and needed some escape.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Best way to buy this group of books.....convenient and always at hand.  Beats hauling around a large volumn everywhere.  Downloaded not only to my Kindle Fire but was able to sync it to my Ipad.
B007WDPPK8|3.0|I love the book, but should have bought the physical book rather than the e book, it is easier for this type of book
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I realize Mr. Day-Lewis got an Academy Award for this, but I found the movie so boring and disjointed that I actually fell asleep a couple of times.
B00BKS1HIA|3.0|I love the book, but should have bought the physical book rather than the e book, it is easier for this type of book
B00263HWM8|2.0|When you watch a popcorn movie, you have to have a high suspension of disbelief.  Okay, gadgets like that exist and work great.  Okay, a person can take a massive beating and still have enough strength to win a fight.  But there has to be something about the plot that makes sense.  I found myself right off the bat saying, &#34;Oh, come on!&#34; The preposterous plot, along with some dreadful dialog gives the actors very little to work with.  This is coming from a person who loved M:I-1 and M:I-3.
0060254920|5.0|I remember reading this book as a child and wanted to read it with my children also. Thank you for offering a new book and shipping it so quick!
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I got this with the free day, and beat it fairly easily, my gf has been playing it and thinks it's cute when the candy critter flood sounds and gives the big eyes when he doesn't get the candy. I'd say this was def ment for kids, which I'll be lending this out to my niece soon when she comes over, she will really like it and she will prob also find the critter funny and cute.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|The movie has a beautiful picture and the story is a classic -- my kids (ages 5 and 3) love it!!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|It's a combo of both, with a bit of the same features, you'll notice asteroid with the giant rocks flying at you, then galactica with a lot of the rest. It's really fun, and works your fingers out if your doing conquest and hardcore if using a tablet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its really easy to get gems, graphics are really good, and its very entertaining. so far so good! I recommend getting it but it took a really long time to download!
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Not much going on with this old school low bit game that has the twist of item scroll, similar to the candy games, only with swords/shields/misc/wands/keys and so forth. The controls are easy, and your able to use a few extra goodies. Gets you started easily, and gets you going. It's not such a game that you play for hours, IMO, it's a if your trying to play match symbols, and kill time sorta game that's still fun and interactive.
B0024F08UG|5.0|In watching the film &#34;Indepence Day&#34; recently, one of the early pop-ups in one of the commentaries recalled how quickly that film was green lighted for production on the bases of the success of this film 20 years previous. It was one of the first, if not the first film to be considered a &#34;blockbuster.&#34;  This film - with an all-star cast, is still a phenominal film. Made with real fire and firemen on set. Owning  many different versions of this film, I can honestly say that the transfer to blu-ray is magnificent. The picture has never looked sharper. I have an APEX 32 inch T.V. and a Philips Blu-ray player in which both have received poor reviews on this and other web sites. I haven't had a problem with either of those items. And for all their limitations, as stated by others, I think the picture lookes spectacular. The sound of the film is crisp and clear. And Yes I have had my eyes and ears tested recently and they are in perfect working order.<br /><br />In short, If you have a Blu-ray player as I do and you love this film as I do. You won't go wrong adding this Blu-ray copy to your collection. The special features are no differant than the 2 disc special adition but who cares? Oh, BTW, the menu is easy to navigate as well. Maybe even more so that some others but that's a personal opinion.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|It was amazing how many characters each actor played during the movie. Just be sure to pay attention to the plot as the storyline changes quite a bit.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Well, it's the best I've read from him thus far.<br /><br />It has everything for his fans- twists, suspense, and a pairing of Mickey Haller and Harry Bosch, two of Connelly's principal characters.  If you are interested in the Lincoln Lawyer series, this is a great place to start.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I liked it could of been longer. I liked the m&agrave;p could have more puzzles. but I liked playing it for the most part
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Best series ever! You get the drama( love, betrayal, loss) without the present day craziness (I.e. hooking up with everything on legs and murder).
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|The album is great. Good songs, good singing. I like their new singer. Sure, it's not Layne, but I hope the current lineup stays around without OD'ing. Love the songs, great musicianship.<br /><br />BUT..... There's Ted Jensen. Another great album brutalized by mr. Jensen's \\"mastering\\". Typical things:<br />- No dynamic range (EVERYTHING JUST SOUNDS EQUALLY LOUD, THE SOFTER PASSAGES INCLUDED)<br />- Distortion. Guitars with that added joy of digital clipping. It just sucks. And once you've heard it, your ears focus on it.<br /><br />It makes me tired after a single listening session. It's sad, so many great albums get destroyed by this man.<br /><br />Still 4 stars. Because it's AIC and the songs are great. This recording is butchered, sadly.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|It's such a great movie, specially if you love dogs. The quality of the cd is good, but the only bad thing is that the cd is copy-protected, so you can't store it in your pc or copy it into another cd in case the original one gets damaged.
B00BQ1D7X4|2.0|The album itself is a pretty good album, about what you'd expect after their last release. Some songs have riffs that are too sludgy and faceless, but it's balanced out by some better tracks such as Stone, Voices, etc. It's nice to see AiC still making hard rocking music.<br /><br />The problem with the album is that it's terribly mastered. The album has a dynamic range of 5. That's terrible. You would've thought that they'd learn from all the complaints over the last release. For that reason I give the album a low rating, otherwise it's a 4. If you are an audiophile (or just like good sound) of any kind you should steer clear of paying for this album. Vote with your wallet and don't pay for poorly mastered music.<br /><br />If you want to vote this review as unhelpful, please tell me why in the comments.
B00364K6YW|5.0|It is one of my favorite movies of all time and the presentation was very good. Makes you want to visit England.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I watch a lot of movies. This is one of the best thrillers I have seen in a long time. Lots of twists and turns, great acting, very well made and lots of &#34;wow I didn't see that coming!&#34; moments.
0800141660|5.0|I really enjoy the story line of two sisters who are close and the trials they go through. The color and scenery is excellent and makes you want to visit England.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Despite knowing the outcome it was well made and a good movie. Jessica Chastain is one of my favorite actresses and carries this movie. If you like this movie I would suggest you also see 'Navy Seal Team 6' which is similar but gives a better viewpoint from the eyes of the Navy Seals who carried out the mission. Loved both movies.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Classic Nicholas Sparks novel!  I couldn't put it down!  It's a must read for Spark's fans everywhere!  I loved it!
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Try it, watch the movie... he is Famous in South Africa... new genera of music, get the CD's or Downloads<br />Cheers
0446581348|5.0|It has help me in my make up class i was doing and it can show you wonders if u are open minded.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|Both my 10 yr old and his 7yr old cousin thought this movie was &#34;Awesome!&#34;  They watch it at least 3 times in the 48hr rental time. It was well worth the money and I will have to purchase the movie in the near future for my son.  5 stars hands down.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I heard of Daft Punk before and enjoyed their music. Love their first album \\"Homework\\" and \\"Alive 2007\\". I can get lost in them. However, their latest album \\"Random Access Memories\\" is AWESOME! The best of all their work in my opinion. I've been listening to the CD for well over a week now and still haven't had enough yet.<br /><br />If you enjoy disco, funk, jazz infusion, 80's and old school techno you're definitely going to enjoy this album. They did an excellent job of bringing all these sounds together in a beautiful display of music art. There isn't one track that I don't like.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We love this show! Missed this episode on TV and couldn't find anywhere online. Great show. Can't wait for next season.
6302787068|3.0|tracking bad even though tv has digital tracking still bad and had not been rewinded but for a penny she will live with it :)
B000E5N6LG|1.0|Dennis Quaid's superbly wacky portrayal of Doc Holliday is the only saving grace in this otherwise overlong, drab, unauthentic soap-opera of a film.<br /><br />The screenplay is stilted, the acting at best stereotypical, and the music unadulterated kitsch.<br /><br />Furthermore, Kevin Costner just isn't the actor to play the kind of solemn, hard-man role required (for which Clint Eastwood has long since inimitably set the bar).
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Same cute Om Nom in new settings, such as underwater, and with creative new gadgets like suction cups, rockets, and more. Very fun.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|The film is an honest tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen who served as fighter pilots in WWII.  Their war was not only against Goering's Luftwaffe but also against against racial discrimination.  This latter war was ubiquitous, whether in their home country, among the closed society of the front-line white airmen of the Army Air Corps and their commanders, or their adversaries, the Aryan defenders of Hitler's Germany.  The film ably illustrates these conflicts, but it does more.  We come to know the fighter pilots, their immediate commanders, their fears and their strong affection for each other.  Indeed, the writers and director have even found space for love in this excellent film.  The hot-shot pilot \\"Lightning,\\" who leads the destructions of a Nazi train, a well-armed enemy ship, and a Luftwaffe fighter base, has sharp eyes and a habit of ignoring orders. His romance with a beautiful young Italian woman whom he first spies close-range from his P-47 skimming above the rooftops is touchingly realized before it ends in tragedy.
B0086DBE62|5.0|Yes, I'm a guy. But, I love Julia Roberts, hence my love for this film. I also appreciate a clear good guy/bad guy story line. The film is free of bad language, sex, and innuendos. Also appreciated. Lots of fun.
B000OSDSKM|4.0|Tense political drama with an incredible cast of both leading and supporting actors which withstands the test of time.  As relevant today as it was when it was made.
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|The visual spectacle of this film makes it worth watching. I would like to have seen more congruency in the story line.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|Used last month on 15 hour flight for Touchpad and phone.  Lasted the whole flight with plenty of battery left over.  Charge time was several hours.<br /><br />Would recommend it to a friend.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I give this two stars because i applaud the creators for confusing me, It did make some sense towards the end but not in a tricky intellectual way that makes you say &#34;oh thats it&#34;. It jumps all over the place back and forth and after about 2 hours 16 mins it just becomes silly.<br /><br /> I watched it because it had decent reviews and some star power but unfortunately my choice to remain mostly drug free throughout my life must be a hindrance in my ability to accept this movie as good. I imagine had i experimented wildly with narcotics while attending an ivy league school and studying philosophy from someone who knows at what rate the sun is decaying then perhaps i would issue this a more positive rating.<br /><br />Thanks
B000GCFBQU|4.0|I chose this book because the main character is a protestant minister.  Quite a change from Olive K. which I didn't like, but decided to give Ms. Strout another try since I like the way she writes.  It is about a minister trying to deal with the psychological ups and downs living in and serving the spiritual needs of folks in a small New England town.  It's well written and worth the read.
1609611543|3.0|The book is ok.  A little hard to read.  The cookbooks is great.  A lot of the informaiton is summarized so if somone just buys the cookbook, they will have enough information.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I truly live Dexter. Season 7 was much better than season 6. I watched the whole thing in 1 week! At two dollars an episode it was am inch better deal than buying the season on disc. ;)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Amazing show, each episode has a dramatic case and all the drama/ happenings of each cast member!  Cant  wait  to  watch  season 4  on  Amazon  prime  and  for  season 5  to air!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|This was not the strongest Batman movie but we love Batman at this house.  Christian Bale does a great job with the character.
B0065RIJ3W|4.0|It is good to have all the basic info in one book rather than jumping from one website to another.  This book compiles the basic information you need to get you try the aquaponics, sort of getting your feet wet.  I am sure i will learn and needing more information as I go along but this gives me a good start.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A wonderful masterpiece of writing!  The plot kept me going and also the action and romance!! The futuristic view of the book was frighteningly real. To sum it up I LOVED the hunger games!!
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|We are nerds and like all things Tolkein, but really this should've been a two-movie series, not three.  It drags in places, but I can't imagine NOT owning this movie, so we do.
B001BP3Z9G|1.0|The DVD would not play because it is from another Region (UK).  It ticks me off because I sent an email inquiry to you about this before I ordered it and was told it was OK!  This is the 2nd time this has happened to me and I probably will not buy any more DVD's from Amazon.
B000W796OM|4.0|We were filling out our Harry Potter collection and the price on this disc can't be beat.  Prisoner of Azkaban is not one of my favorite HP movies, but it's necessary for the set.
B00004CXIB|1.0|This was the 1st DVD that did not play because it was from another region!!  Man on a Wire was the 2nd.  I'm done with buying DVD's from Amazon!!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Absolutely wonderful series! unable to predict each episode........<br /><br />also good lega cases<br /><br />Love all the actors although my favourite is Kalinda Sharma
B00B4804KS|5.0|Loved this movie when it was first released. Seeing it again, and in 3D makes the whole film better and bigger this time around.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book helps you come to a better understanding of the possibility of heaven.  Experiencing through the eyes of a scientist helps to give the reader a well-thought, believable, and real look at the journey we all face and the hope of what is to come!!  Worth the time!!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|So far just as good as the original trilogy. I really enjoyed seeing the golem caracter again. And the story line is great.
0435123432|5.0|Great book at a good price. What else is there to say? I would recommend to others interested in this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|You NEED to make more games like this great story I was hooked could not put it down this was by far the best puzzle game I've ever played on a mobile device<br /><br />R
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Has a little bit of everything. Cars, shooting, and decent story line. overall I will be recommending it to everyone I know.
B00000JPH6|5.0|I bought this for my Son's birthday.....he watched it when he was younger, I can't begin to remember how many times they watched it growing up....we would check it out at the Library....He seemed pleased have this movie.....sometimes it is fun to remember the memories of when we were younger.  Thank you very much.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|In case you haven't heard by now, GoT is an awesome series.  Yes, it's worth getting (because it's totally worth watching).<br /><br />This is the version to own.  Screw the up-tight teabaggers and NeoCons.  It's funny more than anything (like the Irish crew would really give a darn; a wax noggin with a wig on it is a wax noggin with a wig on it -- if the producers hadn't commented about it in the special features, no one would ahve known or cared)<br />I got his head on a spike!  HAHAHAHAH!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|My alarm clock is very good. And interesting. But it would be better if you didn't have to pay for the whole thing to wake up to music
B000VNMMPM|5.0|A rather deep, touching, introspective, humorous, beautifully done, movie.  I think there are a lot of people who would like this movie, even if it’s kinda “artsy”.  Some of the shots are beautifully done.  The story is ok, the pacing is good, the characters are well chosen (mostly lowlifes), the dialogue is good (even though you are just reading subtitles -- unless you know French), and, all in all, in my opinion, it’s a great movie.  It has a couple moments that really delve into the concepts of brutal honesty and acceptance.  It’s pretty well done.
B002O2THRO|3.0|Not a bad movie but certainly not a great movie. Entertaining enough just to say you saw it but that's all.
B000QGEB12|5.0|Why are you reading this?  Seriously, you haven’t seen this movie already?  Are you kidding me?<br />Buy it, it’s not that much!  Buy it used!  Buy an ex-rental for dirt cheap and just watch it!<br />If you don’t like it, pawn it or give it away.  If you DO like it (and you probably will), then go buy the extended version and the version with all the bonus features.  It’s martial arts, it’s Looney Tunes, it’s awesome!<br />Seriously, you have to see it to understand.<br />Buy it.  See it.<br /><br />As for the disc, the Axe-Kickin’ Edition, I liked it.  I wouldn’t say that you need to get it if you already own it, but this would be the version to get if you want this movie.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Craig Johnson is the master of mystery storytelling. From the books \\"The Cold Dish\\" to \\"As The Crow Flies\\" Longmire plays your emotional and philosophical strings. Mm-Hmm, Yes it is so.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this app is really soothing! I love the sound of a cavern! and I love mixing different sounds together! you can<br />make really beautiful combos!
B001NA6096|5.0|Its young people on the kind of night only young people can have - full of sometimes innocuous, sometimes prescient dialog, wandering the streets of a beautiful city, carefree as only one can be at that time in life.  What makes this movie go from ok to great is both the acting (so genuine) and the dialog (natural, flowing and uninterrupted by movie devices).<br /><br />It makes it worth seeing.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|I've seen the play multiple times and listened to the soundtrack.  I really enjoyed every minute of this film - what a great job and excellent casting.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Though not as strong as the first, the artifice around which they meet is the weakest part.  However the dialog picks up where it left off...  and the wee bit of aging in the characters shows through.  I did not enjoy it in quite the same way as the first - but it does make me look forward to the final installment: Before Midnight.
B00CMAK34O|5.0|Glad Agnetha is back on the radio and I'm getting her waves !.<br />She's always had the voice of an angel.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|My family and I watched this movie with our mouths hanging open most of the duration of the movie. The main characters are nuts, but in a way that is a very accurate portrayal of those living with bipolar disorder. The movie did a great job of spelling out the challenges and concerns of the characters. Nothing went too far.<br /><br />Kudos to the cast. Their acting was superb.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. No big surprises. I was expecting a BLAM BLAM Shoot em up with some humor and I got it. Good to see Arnold is aging as fast as I am. No there is no redeeming social undertones of note and no there isn't any life long messages to discern. I just wanted a little light entertainment with some unrealistic fantasy thrown in and I got it.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Read just like the television series: light and breezy, not one of those scary murder mysteries.  Clever banter among the major characters.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I love him and enjoy every movie Daniel Craig has done.  I cried when M died.  OMG I am sad that they killed her off the movie.  She is one of the reasons I watch these 007 movies.  She has to come back. I think they made a big mistake killing off Judi drench character
1594204217|5.0|Great book on cooking. The author experienced the transformation process himself to bring the first hand knowledge and thoughts back to the readers. Great book!
B002JXK5VU|3.0|I guess I'm looking for a &#34;Lost&#34; type of experience.  It seems like they peeled back the layers pretty quickly.  We may watch the next one, however.
8866137626|4.0|I really like the evernote/moleskin combo. I do wish that it came with a larger variety of stickers however. And I wish it had a loop to hold a pen.
B003TTCURU|5.0|As with all of the other seasons, Grey's Anatomy/Season 6 is a bit more intense.  I like seeing how even among the smartest and most accomplished, making your way through life is not easy!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My wife began watching this series on Amazon Prime, and I was quickly drawn into it, as well. It reminds me a bit of &#34;Little House on the Prairie&#34;, but set in the English countryside of the late 1800s. There are several quirky characters that you quickly grow to know and love. Each episode is self-contained, with a resolution or a moral or social lesson. My biggest complaint is that it appears to do what many modern shows do, and that is to take the hot issues of our time and project them onto the people of that time. I sense a strong push of women's liberation and empowerment here, as I saw in later espisode of &#34;Little House&#34;. Women are shown to be at their best when rebellious and independent. Many will agree with that, yet I am not certain it was quite the issue in the tiny villages of England then. I also see socialism and communism presented boldy and favorably all through the series. It was a hot topic at the time, as communism was sweeping Europe. Also, I am a bit perturbed that the two most religious characters in the show are presented as silly and laughable. Watching this show with eyes and mind open, it is a fascinating look into habits, lifestyles, and the daily grind of life for the poor of that time in England. It also has quirky humor and uplifting qualities. If you are looking to entertain yourself with television, I would recommend this series of shows.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|Interesting story-line engaging the youngest in the family right through to the eldest - but we do all love Sci-Fi.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|All I can say is, when is the next one coming out? I want MORE! BTW - please keep future installments as good, fun & clean. Family entertainment - I almost forgot what it was like. Thank you all for creating a movie I enjoyed from beginning to end . . . and sure hope it is not the end, either!
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|The research that went into this book proved fantastic with all of the details and accuracy of the areas and locations of D.C. However, the story and timeline were just not there. Losing a hand and then having an action packed adventure in a single night? Really? Then the faked death of Langdon is followed by some ridiculous excuse for experimental underwater breathing chamber? I never finished the book because it was just so unrealistic. Yes, it is fiction, but the story was just not believable.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I read the book in paperback first with Tom Cruise on the cover, and I love the book.  All the dialogue and action seems straight out of the book.<br /><br />Still, the directing gets overly silly in places (esp. the drug addicts going after Reacher), significant parts and characters are omitted (I expected some stuff to be left out because the book has so much to it, but still there were things that should not have been left out and others that should have), and the acting is mostly pretty disappointing.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is barely adequate - despite this being his type of thing so often - but he just can't carry the movie to greatness by himself, and he is just not 6'4\\".<br /><br />The bad guys come off cardboard.<br /><br />The car chase is great, but a bit too long.<br /><br />The ending is a little different than the book, and I liked it anyway.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|best game ever and its only.99 cents very fun get it now now now now now did you get it yet its amazing
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, & I read a lot. A great one for laughter & slight physical embarrassments. Tina, doll, please write more! We have needs!
B00782O7IY|5.0|I've been wanting to see this great movie.  No wonder it won so many awards.  Will enjoy watching it over and over.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I love the series, I hated to see it end this year. I missed the first two years so I wanted to collect the DVD's so I could catch up.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. It captured all the real properties of what it would be like to have that disease. John Green is one of the best authors. I can't wait for his new books. 5 stars.
B002ZG977Y|4.0|I think the original with Harry Hamlin was by far the better of the two. However I did like the special effects in this version. I could watch it all day.....
B006LSZECO|5.0|I hate reviews with spoilers, so I try not to include them. I thought one thing at the beginning, changed my mind again and then again. I'm still wondering what happened to Nick and Amy and their family..... I love that kind of book!
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Robert Downey is so hot now with Sherlock and Iron Man you can't go wrong with one of his movies. I felt the first one was better of the two.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I really enjoy FOB's new album, it has a lot of different sounds varying from track to track.  It IS a little short, but that's not Amazon's fault.  I've listened to the whole CD at least 50 times since it came out.  If you like FOB's older stuff,  you should like this as well.  It's a little like growing up with them.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Another Marvel masterpiece. Everyone is in love with the super hero's today. Thor is another good movie that is full of action.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Author Gillian Flynn artfully weaves a tale of &#34;love gone wrong&#34; and succeeds in bringing readers along for the tumultuous ride. For those readers who enjoy plot-driven novels, this one definitely hits the mark with its many twists and turns. But what makes Flynn's novel a &#34;five star masterpiece&#34; is her ability to draw readers into the characters' psyches, which makes for an unpredictable journey through page after page of suspense, unanswered questions and misguided finger-pointing.<br /><br />A great weekend escape!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it it's fun to waste time on when your bored or there a slow day at home home or at work bus amazon ggggggggggggg hmmmm assassinated  kkkkmmmmm bobbin
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So glad I stumbled on this series! I love dystopian novels but this series is the most unique premise.  Hugh creates a world you can totally visualize and human characters you care about.  Excellent story telling with a real philosophical edge. Who should decide what people know and don't know about their world?  Scary that our own reality mirrors the Silo in lots of ways.....
B00973902K|5.0|I first seen the video and it made me laugh. But I also liked the song so I bought it.<br />It has an up beat and makes you want to sing along.<br />This was the first song I have ever heard by Carly Rae Jepsen so I went on youtube and listened to other songs she sings.  I then went to Amazon and bought more songs by her.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is a combination of all the space shooter games I am familiar with (mainly from the 80's).  I spent a lot of quarters in the 80's.  If this game had been around, I would have never left the arcade and I would have gone broke!<br /><br />Fast game play, continuous rapid fire, sensitive controls, challenging levels... this game seems to have it all.  I think I would have paid far more than 1.99 (price as of 5/29/13) for this game.<br /><br />One cool feature is that you can \\"continue\\" on the same level after you lose your ship.<br /><br />The ONE thing that is a negative:  Once you exit the game, you lose all game progress.  When you re-enter, you are back to level one.  The game can get a bit monotonous because of this.<br /><br />Other than the losing progress factor, this is a stellar game.  My eleven year old daughter loves the game (and of course, she has unlocked many more levels than I).
B008IJT0CE|5.0|If you are looking for an app for ambient noise, you should look no further. Everything you want and more. This app looks great and works great. Very happy!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Well thought out and thoroughly researched .I must commend the author.Beautiful work well presented ,even the least spiritually minded will have no problems understanding this.
B00280LYHS|5.0|the books are so awesome they are so fast paced. it is so awesome. he did a awesome job on the books!
B00CATSONE|4.0|This book was a great read.  I wish it had gone into more detail of Tesla's life and his inventions.
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|While Deep Purple is indeed a different animal with Steve Morse and Don Airey on board, they are a terrific band with or without their previous history. Moreover, it is 2013 and any listener expectations that the group will still be conjuring the magic sound of the early 70s band is a hopeless, and dare I say, silly thing to ponder. I will say that, in my opinion, to carry on without Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore (unarguably the founders and the soul of the Deep Purple sound) the band should have moved forward under a different name.<br /><br />Be that as it may, Deep Purple have released several good studio and live collections with Steve Morse on guitar (none of which really sound like Deep Purple...seriously, can you imagine Led Zeppelin without Jimmy Page or Van Halen without Eddie Van Halen? Blackmore is just as fundamental to DP). However, Steve Morse is an amazing player and quite an accomplished composer as well, and thus, the music this band makes is should be judged by its own quite excellent merits. Over the last 20 years, the Deep Purple sound with Morse has gradually expanded organically to include some soulful ballads like 2003's &#34;Haunted&#34;, 2008's &#34;Clearly Quite Absurd&#34; and the nearly straight R&B of the wonderful &#34;All the Time in the World&#34; on this current release. These are amongst the very best tunes that have ever been released under the name Deep Purple.<br /><br />&#34;Now What?!&#34; is filled with swaggering gems. As one would expect from DP release, there is a sleek, yet progressive edge to each arrangement. This current line-up is quite bristling with energy, and Ian Gillan sounds wonderfully relaxed and confident on every tune. The production is excellent and captures the feel of a live performance. The songwriting is really solid (&#34;All the Time in the World&#34;, &#34;Bodyline&#34; and &#34;Above and Beyond&#34; are all excellent). Moreover, I love the versatility of the tunes on &#34;Now What?!&#34;, as each sounds unique, yet they hang together well as a collection as well. Both Steve Morse and Don Airey play beautifully throughout, giving each arrangement an elegant touch. This is a great classic rock album!
B0009U5DD0|5.0|A fabulous array of music that makes you want to get up and dance. One of the best CDs I have bought in a long time.
0307271080|5.0|Once I started, I couldn't put this book down. It's full of beautifully written nuance and apt social commentary on race, relationships, and the type of immigration you don't hear about on the news. The sporadic insertion of Ifemelu's blog posts seem random at first but they ended up being one of my favorite things about the book.<br /><br />Watch out for the sad realization that the book has to end at some point. That hit me with more than 300 pages left to go. Loved it that much. Definitely recommending it to my friends
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have read every book in the series. Granted they are not literary classics but they were good enough. This final book is just terrible. I would have loved a different ending. Overall I could not be more disappointed with this novel.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|A great finish to a wonderful series.<br /><br />But more importantly a shout out to Amazon who didn't give me any hassle on an exchange when one of the disks would not play on any of my electronics. Thanks!
B002ZG9846|5.0|I saw the trailer when it first came out and thought it seemed like another kids action movie. However, I did not realize it was rated R until I saw the video. I saw the trailer for 'Kick Ass 2' and thought about seeing Kick Ass. I went back and bought the 'Kick Ass' video and was surprised at how good it was.  As the title says, it is supposed to be about 'Kick Ass', but it was 'Hit Girl' that stole the show. I watched Chloe Moretz in a few movies like '500 Days of Summer', 'Hugo', 'Dark Shadows' and people kept talking about her in Kick Ass in reviews and interviews. Watching Chloe as the, swearing and ass-kicking 'Hit Girl' was the best thing in the movie next to Nicholas Cage's 'Big Daddy'. She was is in nearly every action scene shooting and slicing bad guys. It's sad I did not get to see this in the theaters, oh well.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Parting is such sweet sorrow, or so they say. In this case, parting is a tremendous wrenching of a decades old love affair. In Dead Ever After, Ms. Harris ties up all the loose ends in her usual dramatic fashion. Things I thought I knew were flipped and it left me gaping in shock.<br /><br />One thing I can count in this series is action. Sookie has been the target of numerous supernatural plots throughout the series but none have come close to what goes on in this book. That poor girl didn't catch a break through most of the novel. If it's not one thing, it's a person come to dredge up things from the past. Surprise!<br /><br />A reader should not start reading about Sookie at the end because they will never understand the shock, the heart-twisting truths or the crushing decisions that pepper this book with devastating yet effective results. This truly is the culmination of everything that readers have gone through with Sookie and pals. Read the first book, get hooked like I did but have the benefit of living in Sookie-world for thirteen roller coaster thrill rides back to back and discover the heart pounding events that take place. It's an amazing experience. One I'm sad to see end, but after reading this, I can see the logic behind it.<br /><br />Readers will see the ending of some story threads, the beginning of something else and a final ultimate conclusion to something that I'd thought was already resolved. Imagine my horrified fascination to find out there was yet one more diabolical twist that Sookie needed to face. I never, ever saw that coming. Neither did Sookie. There was more drama, suspense and nail-biting paragraphs than ever and the writing kept me spellbound.<br /><br />I can't say who she ends up with. About four books back, I started thinking it would be a good match up after all but it never seemed to build enough for me to be sure. In this final book, I'd have to settle for a happily for now because with Sookie Stackhouse, one just never knows. I mean look what happens in this book! I've said it before and I'll say it again. Ms. Harris is devious. She has never shied away from having her characters make hard choices and this author stayed true to form. I've read about many readers being unhappy. I'm not one of them. Yes, I'm sad because I have been following this series from the very first and there was something magical and different about the author's writing and imagination that simply captured my interest - and never let go. I'm gloomy because it's over. However, after reading this book and the way it ended, though no less exciting and suspenseful as those in the past, it absolutely fit. Ms. Harris tied up the loose ends the way they had to be done to keep her characters' integrity. They were who they were and anything different would have been unnatural. It amazes me how she kept everything so together.<br /><br />Are there questions left hanging? Yes - little ones. Case in point, Sookie's nephew. Perhaps years down the line, Ms. Harris will grant readers with another visit to Bon Temps, with a visit from Aunt Sookie. Maybe it could be a holiday story or something to give us a definitive, final, sink-your-teeth-in-firmly type tale for those readers who need that extra assurance. As for me, I'm good. I accept this ending as the way it should be, Sookie Style.<br /><br />Dead Ever After is hard-hitting, powerful and at times, astonishing. Yet, Ms. Harris balanced it all with a bit of humor, with writing that touched my emotions and had an ending that left me with a wistful Mona Lisa smile. I say a fond fare thee well to Bill, Eric, Alcide, Pam, Tara, Sam, Jason, Hunter, Michele and Mustpha Khan, Niall, Mr. C, Diantha and the unforgettable Quinn. My sniffles and heaviest sighs go to Sookie, a unique and special character that truly is a literary gem in the paranormal romance genre. Thank you Ms. Harris for a series that took me away to a place I'd never been before. This final book is a keeper.<br /><br/>Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews/>Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|This book is really moving,but one of the parts, the one from Justin's point of view, is missing both quotation marks and capitalization which ruins the experience.

B007KQ6XYY|4.0|My 7 year old granddaughter saw this on my Kindle and wanted to try it.  So by purchasing it for her, we have a new fun game to master.  She, of course, mastered it in one day.  My husband is now hooked on it, and is trying to master it without the help of the 7 year old.  It is loads of fun.

B00BIVN82M|1.0|I am terribly disappointed with Michael Buble's new studio album To Be Loved. The entire album (and I really mean it) is over sung, over engineered, over orchestrated and played, and louder than it needs to be. Clearly, Buble wants to sing everything, and be everything a musician can be on a single album. IMO this is a huge, huge fall from an otherwise stellar line of past albums, and I shall not hesitate to say that this needs to be classified under \\"really tasteless contemporary pop s***\\". Ugh!    Why, oh why does a very talented singer fall for every cliche, every tired commercial trick in the book, all at once???? What gives?
006016848X|5.0|Bought this a gift for my friend because she loves these novels. She said they are great read and keep you intrigued!
B00AY0A71I|5.0|It's been ages since I seen this movie and it is still as funny as before! The cast is flawless... Kevin Kline as the pretentious Otto, John Cleese is hilarious but Michael Palin just nails it... \\"The ca... The ca... The ca...\\"<br /><br />Must see for any comedy fan
B008XG1X18|5.0|Keeps you occupied for hours. Love pinning all day long.It's awesome on the Kindle compared to my little iphone screen.
B00821OX98|2.0|I had to stop watching it. Formulaic drek at it's finest. Simply awful. Don't waste your time. Go paint something and watch it dry for a better experience.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|A great match 3 experience. It could use some way to extend the play time. I beat it in 3 or 4 days playing on &off. It was a great time while it lasted.
B008393Q2O|3.0|I guess it is okay but I really don't use it very much.  It was fun to fool around with but will probably delete it from my Kindle
B009T8XBBO|5.0|Repetitive gameplay but man was it fun. Tons of levels & getting high scores builds your castle. It even has a story that is voiced... not typical for apps of this nature. I spent hours playing to get a perfect score on each stage.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|I have read all of his Reacher books and they vary from vary good to good.  I like Jack Reacher even if he is hard to believe at times.  But I know that when I pick up one of his stories, I am going to be entertained from beginning to finish.  If you like Jack, you will like this story!  MEW in Dallas!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is worth ur money! I love this because its like a mini little minecraft I like it more then Pc minecraft!
B000I9TY4G|5.0|The Big Damn Movie to an equally epic show that was cut down before it could even begin couldn't have been better.  The crew of the Serenity get the send off they deserve and everything falls into place.  I must admit however that when I first heard of Firefly, it was from this movie.  I didn't get into the show itself until much later and I have felt like a total idiot ever since for not jumping on the 'mule' while it was still movin'.  In all seriousness, I'm with the legion of fans in that this should have lasted a Hell of a lot longer than it did but I won't repeat an already worn out argument that won't change nothin' anyway lol.<br /><br />And if anyone's curious, Browncoat all the way!
B007SNYQFC|5.0|This was the first Ridley Pearson book I read. Absolutely had me from the get-go. I never saw the ending coming ... Now that's my kind of book !!!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Superhero shows have a tendency to not do so well on the silver screen.  Whether it's from a lack of interesting characters, plot, story, or a number of different things, they never seem to last.  With the recent influx of superhero movies such as Avengers, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, and even Green Lantern though, should it come as any surprise that we get this?  It seems someone finally did something right with Arrow and has assembled a stellar cast and made an even more impressive modern day version of the archer from DC Comics' impressive roster of heroes.  I don't know much about the history of Oliver Queen from his comics, but in all honesty I would probably prefer what I've seen in the show so far anyway so it's rather a moot point.  Everything seems to be going pretty well for the show and I hope the second season ends up being just as good if not better than the first.  Although with the epic season finale we got not too long ago, I'm not sure how it can be beat lol.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|one of the best movie series in the last two decades. Matt Damon is awesome in the lead role and the supporting casts are all stellar. the action is great but the story lines are equally compelling. cant miss.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Really great game.  Good practice and learning tool.  Like the appearance. Wish there was some kind of help menu. Worth the cost.  Ha-ha!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is an epic tale of good vs evil. The weak finally realize their strength in numbers and upon noticing they are not as alone in this world as they first believe, an unbreakable bond forms amongst those you least expect at every turn! Human weakness turns into true heroism, imperfections and all! A truly heart wrenching story about love, loss, and the human condition at its best and worst! I could not put these books down and have now read all three novels a total of three times! My new favorites!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is one of the best free apps I've found - love how customisable it is. It's great to awaken to a favorite song, very nice snooze features and extremely easy to use.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I just opened this little gem up and plugged it into my Lenovo thinkpad running Linux Mint 14 (with low latency kernel).  Worked out of box!  No fiddling whatever.  Great price for a nice little usb interface.  The sound was clean with my studio mic.  No hiss (except for the hum of the computer fan, which came through load and clear :) and the preamp seems to have a nice balanced sound.  Very impressed with this piece of equipment.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|I am not a music critic, musician, or writer... just a fan who has been around long enough to know what she likes to listen to, appreciates the quality in what she hears and applauds the artistic ability of the musicians involved! ~Congratulations To Sound Of Contact!! Really nice, new, progressive rock. Best of luck!!
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Kids love it! They keep it in the CD player all the time. I am not crazy about it. I like only 1 or 2 songs then the rest all sound the same to me. If I was a tween I bet I would love it though.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Each storyline is different and unique. It is not as good as the BBC Sherlock Holmes, but I like the twist they give this show. I enjoy Watson being a woman and it taking place in NY.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|Bond is a favorite band of Xueyun. I began to listen to Bond, willing to know more about what she likes.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I just can't say enough good about E2. I had never heard of Pam, but saw the high ratings and excellent reviews and purchased the book based on that. It is truly one of the best purchases I've ever made.<br /><br />The experiments are practical and fun AND THEY REALLY WORK!!!<br /><br />Pam has an excellent sense of humor that comes through in her writing making this a fun book to read. If you are looking to change your thinking and start creating an amazing life...this book is a must have. It is as good or even better in some ways than The Secret because Pam walks you step-by-step through experiments that become exercises that become result producing habits.<br /><br />Thank you Pam! You pulled me out of the ditch I was in with this gem!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|this movie was amazingly done. I have not read the books yet, however it has encouraged me to do so!!! well done fight scene and great action all through out the movie. definitely something I will be watching again and again
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love being able to watch the special features and on my own timeframe. Great DVD thank you very much
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|On behalf of Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson brings this series to a very potent, soul-tearing, and ultimately very satisfying closure.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I especially like all the different optional layouts.  Challenging!  I'm enjoying it lots!  From easy to more difficult layouts keeps it never boring.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I think this book has healing power...Nice to have a good cry over others sorrow...and contemplate your own...to resurrect and reconstruct values .... assess life's meaning in relation to where you are and where you are going...or headed to...a kind refrain revealing the intimacy of the sound of wind...the feel of rain...the smell of green growing things...reconnection with the real and valuable...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing! Love love love.  I am totally addicted and going to watch again! It was so easy to have it streamed to my iPad!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Hoping for Season 3 to be released free on prime video soon!  We watched Season 1 and Season 2 back to back.  The first episode of Season 1 had an inappropriate scene that discouraged me from wanting to watch subsequent episodes.  But friends assured me that there were no more after the first one.  So, I trusted them and did try the next episode and was hooked.  The historical period is intriguing and the actors are fabulous.  Enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|bought it when it was still 6.99. I didn&quot;t even regrett it. This is the best game I have ever played. You should definitely get it. But i do only recommend it to people that already know this game.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a really fun app. It is great for kids.  Enjoy it. I play it a lot. Have fun.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first book, liked the second and struggled to finish the third. The story just did not carry for three books
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Perfect, does exactly what it promises, wish all apps delivered this well.<br />Very handy, nothing more to say.<br />Thank you.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I Saw this Movie On the Big Screen. Loved It , then I saw In2 Darkness , then I wished I was back to See Tom's Movie Oblivion the Real Thing. I will buy this Movie when Its In 3 D.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Exciting adventure, but of course won't find out what happens until the end of the third part!!!!Good scenery, like the acting.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|This Movie Is Worth $0.99 for a Coaster or fling It and say \\" Look at the UFO \\" Just think It was In Space , It saw Stars , Comet's , the Star Ship On our Own Moon From the NASA 20 Landing , the Face On Mars , It Knows the ^^^ . Not the Enterprise JJ. J.J. Is there to KILL Star Trek. I watch all the Trek's and Know (J.J)Into Darkness SUCK'S!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I enjoyed it, but too many people would just write out the words instead of drawing the picture....what fun is that for guessing the drawing?  so I deleted it.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|More Willard Willis Movies I make It a Point to see all Willard's Movies. There Not the 5th Element , But Its Bruce
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Was and was not what I expected. Thought perhaps nothing more than \\"when good drugs go bad\\" but I was wrong. SO, although it starts slowly, keep with it. Nice twists and turns. Date movie: yes. View with spouse: yes. Male only viewing: not so sure.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|I'm a longtime fan of Alice - they were my first 'favorite band', and their music is an integral part of my musical and artistic life. I just want to throw out my two cents in a mini-review for their new CD.... The new Alice in Chains records is simultaneously annoying and amazing - there's so much 'wall of sound' with the vocals and guitars, it's rare that you can actually distinguish one particular riff or melody. It's beautifully lush and dense, with reverb, echoes, drones, and panning tricks filling your head, but it's also ambiguous. There's only one or two moments in each song where you'd hear something catchy or 'hooky' and then it's on to 4 minutes of elaborate, layered, albeit interesting, overproduction. I'm not against the art of making a 'studio' record, but when you have so many overdubs you can't understand the lyrics anymore, especially while listening intently with studio-quality headphones, something is wrong. These are just my first listening impressions, it will take some repeated listenings before I can decide a final verdict. but, as it stands, \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" is pretty awesome, and is at least equal in quality to their previous album. Its best parts stretches to reach the quality of their 'classics', but unfortunately -most- of the musical ideas on the album doesn't hold up to their best works.
B001VM0LAK|5.0|Bruce is one smart killer but the FBI is after him. From beginning to end, this movie is smart, action filled and well paced. Even after all the years, holds it own today, 2013. Date movie? Sure. Viewing with spouse? Sure as not much in the way of foul language or spurting blood. Man only? Yes, definitely. If you have never seen this, a good one.
B00BPEWNZU|5.0|If you love guitar driven rock like I do, you will love this album. Rival Son's guitarist Scott Holiday aka &#34;Fuzzbird&#34; himself commented on The Gear Page that they used at least 10 different fuzz pedals on this album, and you can really hear the super wide variety of tones in the songs. Beyond the killer guitar, the band sounds tight and ready to fight their way to the top of vintage sounding yet modern rock bands. 5 stars all day long!
1449437524|5.0|Love all of The Oatmeal books, and I am a dog lover at heart. This really represented me and my relationship with my dog, and was a great entertaining read.
B004UID2LC|5.0|stop saying it don't work because it does all y'all haters and h.o.d on this app and go to another app
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|This movie is just the cutest fairy tale. Great actors. Special affects are great with a great story line. Love!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My grandchildren and I play this on my Kindle.  It's very entertaining. Especially on long trips. I recommended it highly
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I like it very much. It is pretty neat. How many more words do I type before I reach at least 20? Oh, there. That's a little more than enough. Here's a bonus smiley:  :-)
B008BU75IQ|5.0|thrilling continuaton of the Clifon Chronicles. Cant wait for the rest of the series. My kind of books, I like following a family in a series through ups and downs, twists and turn in plot. I recommend it!
B00AYM6JFO|4.0|We enjoy Willie Nelson very much and find this album to be pleasant listening.  We like Willie's adventures into different genre songs and his partnering with other musicians very much.  This is a good album.
B003VW8GT6|5.0|strong cast, great storie, one of my favorite John Wayne movies. Dean Martin's best roll, if you like westerns this one is a must see
B000PXUA5W|5.0|I've just bought 2 more to keep on the side as last minute birthday gifts.  Children love changing the colors on the strap and the face is clear which makes it easy to read (with numbers!).  Very happy with purchase and so are the kids
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I am a fan of the original series and have had little interest in most of the modern knockoff, but I though this was a good movie and I look forward to seeing the next one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very dramatic show with curves and twist that have you on edge during the entire season.<br />The life of an aristocrat is very intriguing and sophisticated
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Now kids, this is the way you write songs! This is an album I always come back too!  Better than any tranquilizer!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Great characters and terrific cinematography.  An excellent show that stands out above the rest.  Looking forward to next season already.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Another great CD by Bon Jovi, if you are a Bon Jovi fan you will love it. After seeing the first leg of his tour I would recommend seeing them live as well.
B008CRC506|5.0|JUST SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST SERIES ON TV!! THE TALENT WAS AMAZING.. THE SONGS OUTSTANDING!!<br />WHERE GLEE IS ALSO A MUSICAL..AND I LIKE THE SHOW A LOT..<br />THIS IS SO MUCH MORE COMPELLING!! AND WHAT AN AMAZING GROUP OF PERFORMERS!!<br />MEGAN HILTY-- ONE WORD- UNBELIEVABLE!
B00947N6UG|5.0|My 4 year loves this movie and has become one of my all time favorite animated movies, it makes you want to belive.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I like this show. There are very good characterizations, good actuation, good story lines, lots of action, very good fight sequences and intrigue. This show keeps you interested. The selection of Stephen Amell as the Green Arrow was great. Besides of Oliver character, Diggle and Felicity are among my favorites characters. I can't wait to see more from this series.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|I was prepared not to like this simply because the literary Jack Reacher is 6'5&#34; and blond and Tom Cruise just didn't fit the profile.  However, I'd have to admit that he did such a good job I'm hoping for a sequel.  There are over a dozen Reacher novels to choose from...
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I was in Junior High when this event occurred and King has captured the emotions of the country at that time and has recalled events, people and places with added excitement.  I will read it again.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|No issues. It does what its supposed to do very well. Much more convenient than the website, i m o.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series is well acted and beautifully filmed, with good stories and a wide variety of well developed characters.  Reminds me of Cranford and other popular British series.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I loved the  book , but the end made me scream.  I do hope there will be another to let us know what happens.  Was under the impression that this was going to be the last in this series.  Now I am definitely hoping that I can expect another one to follow.  The Besr Kept Secret was enjoyable, but want to hear that another book is in the making.
B009C7JS14|4.0|Great to have local weather for my little town at the touch of my finger-tip.  This one is a must have.
B0094K1PW4|3.0|The storyline wasn't very well developed.  The concept was good but the dialogue was lacking and didn't do a very good job of helping to bring the story together.
B009R9WAZ8|4.0|A Rihanna-cd with great variety and some amazing songs. Besides the known &#34;Diamonds&#34; and &#34;Stay&#34; there´s that beautiful &#34;Love without Tragedy/Mother Mary&#34;. Right on edge!
B001NLL8LA|3.0|At around half way, I thought the plot was getting thin, but Child had many more characters to fold into the story.  The book was very enjoyable, but.  I don't think it is Child's best work.  It's just a little too implausible for me.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I have not been able to stop playing this game. It's a lot of fun and time consuming. I recommend it to anyone out there. It's easy to follow but challenging enough to keep you hooked.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Start by watching the movie Serenity; same cast and story. The series is pure fun and entertainment.  Wild west with sci-fi in space.
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|As a Star Trek fan, I'll go see anything in the theater that has ANYTHING to do with the franchise. That being said, I went to see the re-booted Star Trek and the new movie.<br /><br />The new cast has talent, and you can see it on the screen. J.J. Adams has talent as well. So why, WHY use ST:TWOK as your plot line? Does this mean we have the possibility of the crew of the Enterprise saving the whales? If you're going to recycle ST plot lines, here's a couple of my recommendations;<br />Harcourt Fenton Mudd with his women and Tribbles<br />The planet that based their civilization on the Roaring '20s (one of my personal favorites)<br />\\"Balance of Terror\\", the battle between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship<br />Trelane<br /><br />Or, here's a thought: how about something totally different? There are countless writers out there (check the SF magazines like ANALOG & Azimovs) ready and willing to write a story that would fit into the re-booted ST.<br /><br />The characters in the re-boot just seem to me to be a bit young to be handed the responsibility of a starship headed out for a five year mission. And the romance on the bridge, well, I don't think that would tolerated. Please, don't make this into Star Trek: 90210. And J.J. as a personal favor to me, please make the next movie without someone falling hundreds of feet.
B008Q00BOQ|5.0|I like these movies - grew up watching the tv show and like the moview - fun to watch! - Cant wait for more to come out
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Ghost now Ghost B.C. are a melodic hard rock band similar to the great Blue Oyster Cult with many other textures thrown in to create a very interesting blend. They are really horror rock not heavy metal. They want to scare the crap out of people and seduce them at the same time. The satanic s*** is just about theatre and is no different than what kiss or Alice Cooper did in the 70's.  The lyrics are very satanic but I don't believe they worship satans fatass anymore than I believe freddie krueger works at churches fried chicken joint. It's all entertainment. I love both of their albums. You can't please everybody I guess but 1 star is really an insult to give this excellent horror rock album.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie not to mention Matthew McConaughey and that face : ). Don't know why I waited so long to see it.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|Not much to say, I use to watch this as a kid....still love it and so does my 14yr old sister
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Im really into fantasy movies and this one was pretty cool, glad I watched it. I have not had the time to see what's out there in this genre but def liked this one.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This is a great movie. Even men will enjoy it! It's not boring,  but is a love story of sorts. Barbara Streisand sings Evergreen in it. I think its her greatest movie. My favorite anyway. Don't let the movie cover throw you off, it's a great movie.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I can rate this movie in a few words, Awesome! Great! CLassic, I hate musicals but absolutely Love this movie!!! It's one of my favorite movies of all time!!!
B00CL50KDY|4.0|I am afraid of Zombies and this was tolerable due to the romantic nature.  It was a sweet rendition of romeo and juliet with a happy ending.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|This album is wonderful. It is as great as I had expected. It has been worth buying. I would recommend to anyone
B008X6N1OA|4.0|My four year old granddaughter and I love all the Ice Age movies.  This one seems a bit complicated to me, but my granddaughter loves it anyway.
B005VPXNV2|5.0|If you are a fan of psychological thrillers, you must see this movie!  Kathy Bates received the Best Actress Oscar for her performance in this movie in 1991.  If you watch her performance as the delusional Annie, you'll agree with all the accolades.  Anyone who watches this movie will watch it more than once just to catch all the hilarious comments Annie makes.  Excellent movie.
B002ZG997M|5.0|This is a very Awesome SiFi flick, great story line, and even better twist at the end, not what you would expect
B001FB563E|5.0|This is a Very good flick well thought out great story line, makes you think, what would you do in this type of situation?.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|The Ultimate SiFi Flick ever, Great story line, the CGI is simply awesome, if you pay attention, you will see a lot of parallels, between what we done and what we still do with native people who stand in the way of progress of GREED.
B00C391Y3I|4.0|Being this is the first Judas Priest concert release on HD (blu ray) and in 16x9, the overall picture and sound quality is superb.  It's obviously a drag KK dropped out of the band, however, Richie Faulkner seems to have made a smooth transition in the band with solid guitar work and strikingly similar looks to Mr. Downing, albeit a younger version.  The set list is what you would expect with the exceptions of a great version of Never Satisfied from Rock-a-Rolla and a blistering version of Beyond the Realms of Death from Stained Class.  Most the set is material Judas Priest have played in the past, nevertheless, it's a fun show to watch.  I do love the Priest!  My main problem with the DVD is the editing--which is horrible.  Alex Walker (the director/ editor) can't stay on a shot for more than a second before making a cut.  There must be 10,000 edits in this show so If your prone to seizures you may wanna stay away from this one!  It's definitely worth having for fans but I can only give this a 4 star because of the poor directing/ editing.  Sorry Alex, you might be better suited for hip-hop.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|It took me 5 years to get my husband to watch this program now he likes it so much he can't wait for season 8 to come out.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fun playing it..And can play it anytime and anywhere. Have lots of friends who are playing it to. Just fun...
B00005UWNB|1.0|I love this movie but im sad to say the dvd i ordered of boys dont cry never worked! I tryed playing it on all of our dvd players, 3 in total & one is a new blue ray! So its not the dvd players fault but the faulty disc!!! Im now not sure if i will ever order anymore discs or even electronics if that!!! :(......not happyyyyy
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|This show is an emotional roller-coaster (I am sorry but you have to see the entire show to know what I mean). However, I cannot wait for Season 4.<br /><br />To all the cast, I love every one of you, dearly.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Don't Explain  was terrific, Seesaw is just awesome. For Nutbush City Limits play it as loud as your neighbors will allow and hope you don't blow your speakers.
B00APAENUI|5.0|Once again we are shown that religion can take a disagreement and turn it into a jihad.  It's one thing to be tolerant and have varying beliefs but even on Grayson where you think they had learned from the Masadan balls up they still have those who can't change for the better.  This was a great book and really showed the human side of Honor but I still hated to see so much death of those near and dear to her.  It was integral to the story but sometimes I wonder how much she can take.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|If you like the movies,  and dinosaurs this game is for you.  The only this bad about it is it takes forever to level up without spending money on it
B00969PR18|4.0|It's not Google but it's pretty good. I recommend it because the price was right (free is always a good price).
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|Arnold is just too old to play an action figure anymore. The final fight scene was almost too painful to watch. Plus, he looks so completely out of shape. The movie itself was boring. No surprises at all.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I love this tennis game for my iPad 3. Passes the time but is frustrating at times. It appears when you first start playing, you can win some games and even some matches. Then, all of a sudden (for me, after I purchased a Grand Slam package) I can't win squat. It frustrates the heck out of me but it is still a great game and I highly recommend it. It's lots of fun.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|This is easy to set up and use, and then transfer the photos from the memory card.  The only drawback is that sometimes slides would get stuck in the scanner and I needed needle nose pliers to get them out.  This seemed to happen with some older slides that had thicker than usual mounts.  I didn't try it with negatives, but for slides, it is quick and easy.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This season has had some of the funniest and bittersweet storylines. I have laughed until I have cried, especially during the boys vs. girls game night episode and cried when the gang each told Howard a different version of a letter his long lost father had sent to him. The writing and acting is exceptional. This show is my absolute favorite!
B000002PC6|5.0|IMO, Totally Hot and Physical represent ONJ's best work -- and I like almost everything she's done!  If you are looking to buy just one ONJ album, I'd recommend one of these two over a GH compilation; you'll get a better representation of what ONJ is all about, plus you'll have the option of buying more ONJ albums when you decide you like this one!
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|There is very little that remains to be written about one of Brubeck's most popular albums since the reviews all seem to be unashamedly laudatory.  And why not?  \\"Take Five\\" has become a classic in its own right and the album often is purchased for this song alone.  The other tracks are as good and, in some ways, even better.  Brubeck has said that \\"Take Five\\" is an extraordinarily difficult piece to play because it punishes his hands.  If you haven't heard it, listen to it and imagine that you must play that song in every concert, every college date, and every club appearance throughout the world.  It's tough even for a professional musician.  Ok.  Perhaps Tchaikovsky is tougher.  But is it more enjoyable?
B0091REZMW|4.0|Mystery Manor has been enjoyable so far. It takes time to recharge but overall no complaints. Fun for kids too.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Just reread it its an amazing book;) the ending and everything it just wraps it up perfectly!!! IT WON'T BE A WAIST
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|My front door is recessed thus, the porch light does not illuminate the front door key lock making it very difficult to use the key at night.  Also, at night, it was difficult to view out the peep hole to see who was at the front door.  This light was easy to install, provides enough light to identify people and the key hole and so far has required no battery replacement (more than 3 months).  The motion sensor detects approaching people at about 10 feet and lights the LED lights.  They stay lit only for a short time once movement in the detected area ceases.  Works exactly as I hoped.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Always get something new. Steinbeck was a genius & philosopher.  He brings the central coast to life & into perspective. Timeless.
0684135051|2.0|I was surprised when I received this book - it wasn't what I expected.  Already donated it to Good Will.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|it was very easy to get this adaptor to work with my Windows 8 tablet. I'd tried a cheaper brand before but it was only 100 Mb/s and this one is a full 1 Gb/s speed. It does what it needs to do with no hassle. I've tried to set static IP on the adaptor and unplug/plug again to find settings are remembered by Windows 8 so that's nice. This little adaptor appears solid and will likely just work for years.
0679805273|5.0|Giving this book to my nephew for high school graduation.  He will joining the Marines.  I grew up with Dr. Suess, did not realize these books were so inspirational. I highly recommend the book!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is a great family because you can compeat to try and get a dragon before your other family members and also brag to them to!
B000BBOV8U|5.0|I'm an 80's girl.  I love Bryan Adams.  I highly recommend the CD, all his favorite classics. I Love it!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app allows me, on my kindle fire, to download music for free onto my music player. Once I pick the video I want, I download it as an mp3. This then downloads and goes to my gallery. But wait, it is also saved to my amazon mp3 music player (app that comes with kindle fire) . So at the gallery, I delete the cover album picture (just because I don't like thumbnail pictures), and listen to it through my amazon mp3 player instead.<br />*Deleteing the song from my gallery did not delete the song or audio at all, only the photo that the YouTube video thumbnail displayed was erased.
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|I'm an 80's girl! Great CD and all the hits and the classics from the 80's.  I highly recommend the CD.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I spent time getting emotionally invested in characters that I barely recognized by the end.  Poor way to end series.
0143120255|5.0|I purchased this book for my geography class when they were learning about France. Though in middle school they still enjoy being read to. This book was a fun little exercise. I skipped all of the parts that I thought were inappropriate for seventh graders.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I can't believe anyone would give this book one star! That truly amazes me. This book will change your life if you let it. It puts the emphasis on all the right things and puts everything into perspective. I read it once a year at least! Don't just sit there! Buy this!!
0156012073|5.0|I bought this book to read aloud to my seventh grade classes. The students enjoyed the story and the illustrations. The book is a classic.
B0009OIDLA|1.0|Picture Quality is terrible, this looks like a bootleg copy. All movies on disk set are bad, you can watch on Mclintock on NetFlix with 10X better quality!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The season started a bit slow, but picked up steam and ended with some of the best brotherly moments of the entire series. New showrunner Jeremy Carver has expanded the mytharc in a way that gives the series a lot of new ground to cover. Jared Padalecki as Sam Winchester and Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester continue to give layered and nuanced performances. They are joined by a wonderful cast of supporting characters, including Misha Collins as Castiel, Rachel Miner as Meg, Osric Chow as Kevin Tran, Ty Olsen as Benny, Mark Sheppard as Crowley, as well as great guest appearances by Felicia Day, DJ Qualls, and Curtis Armstrong. I highly recommend this season and the whole Supernatural series.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|A clever magic system as always and this is one of Brandon's hallmarks. He excels at creating interesting and unique ideas for magic and social structures.  This book certainly delivers on that. Very entertaining and easy to read.  I found the characters intriguing and endearing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|What is next?  I seem to have gotten past all the goals and now I just keep aquiring coins.... should the game not END at some point?
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Mis fans will enjoy this remake.  It's full of drama, romance, action, and life.  Hugh Jackman gave us an impressive and stellar performance from beginning to end.  Great film!
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|I missed this show when it aired live. Thankfully it's included in Amazon Prime. This is a short season and is entertaining enough for fans of the genre. Worth viewing.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I have enjoyed and loved Jane Austen for so long!  This is by far, my favorite movie version of this novel.
B000B8L6LI|4.0|I have never owned a proper sharpening set for the various knives that I have.<br />This set is exactly what the doctor ordered. I felt  I did not need the higher classed sets,<br />and after using it, I wonder how I got along with out it for so long.<br />All of my good kitchen/pocket-knives now are usable.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|We will definitely enjoy watching this film repeatedly!  After Titanic, who knew James Cameron could make another epic film like this?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's the Walking Dead, need I say more? :)<br />Very interesting story line, great make-up work on the zombies, and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen to characters you grow to care about.
B0011Z51T8|4.0|Well, the White Stripes really put it all together on the disk.  I love the different styles put to each song.  This is a real joy to listen to.  I really like it a lot.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|This show has a very interesting plot line and the amount of gore is appropriate and is there to tell the story, not gore for gore's sake.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't wait to read the rest of the series hope they are as good as the first one fifty shades of gray
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|When I heard that Nile Rodgers played on this song it sealed the deal for me as an old disco fan.<br />His music is timeless and that he has collaborated with Daft Punk shows that he still has it.
B0081SRJSY|1.0|*UPDATE* I did the Test Drive a few times.  The game Carcassone has no hidden game play components nor do you need to bargain with other players like you would need to do with a game like Settlers of Catan to build the fun.  This makes Carcassone the perfect board game translated for play on a tablet.  The most confusing part of the game is figuring out and adding the points, and in the app, it's done automatically for you!<br /><br />Beautiful graphics and interface aside, this android app does not have the solitaire mode or the ability to play online with friends like the ipad/iphone version has.  With the local game play, I can play with a few friends by sharing the tablet.  With internet game play, I can play a game with family and friends who are across the bridge or overseas.  By myself, I can do a solitaire challenge or play against the computer.  I love this game.  But I'll stick to my ipad version and won't buy this android app for my phone until at least these two features are added.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Not terribly bad for an ending, but I felt there was a lot left unsaid between characters. I realize Sookie didn't die, but I needed some finality between her and certain characters (past loves, friends).
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I wanted a lightweight cover for my Kindle Fire.  Purchased this cover in December 2012 and have been using it on a daily basis since.  LOVE THIS COVER!  It performs as advertised. Kindle fits so snuggly and it is so slim lined, you barely even know it is there. It puts up with daily abuse, being shoved in and out of my purse, opened and closed several times a day and I use the stand all the time, yet still in mint condition. Happy, happy, happy.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Saw this movie in the theater and liked it so much we watched it again!  Good movie! Lots of action that keeps you interested.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|These were ok.  They were actually a lot smaller than what I thought they would be.  My child loved them anyway of course.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I was a bit skeptical of watching this movie and am certainly glad that I did.  I liked it a lot and found it to be well written and it kept my attention throughout.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Just finished reading book two getting ready to order book three I love the story line, kinda make really wnt to no what the ending will be.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|A little long but very entertaining. Top notch acting and surprisingly funny at times. Enjoyed watching it and would highly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever<br />Everyone should get this game because you will have fun with it also. I play it all the time.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|The movie is wonderful<br />The color and clarity were great<br />The sound was perfect.<br /><br />We just loved the whole package.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|This product works great once you get it set up and synced with your computer.  The bezal is finicky and difficult to use and can be quite irritating when you try to move through the menus.  I don't like the fact that you cannot replace the battery yourself and you have to send it in to have that done.  That part I don't understand at all....what if the battery goes out when during the middle of your training....you will have to send it in and probably have to wait weeks to get it back. :(  But it works great on my hikes and the battery life seems to last about 8 to 9 hrs and It works when I'm out in the middle of nowhere.  Yes I would recommend this product...just hate the battery issue.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I just finished watching Beautiful Creatures. I'm finding it hard to believe this movie has such low reviews. It was a great movie.<br />I have read all the books. Just because a movie isn't exactly like the book you love does not mean it's an awful movie. I can't believe people are being so harsh about their reviews. I thought it was a great movie, so don't let these people with crazy expectations that gave this movie low ratings deter you from watching it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|How will I survive!? I'll miss Sookie! And Eric, mostly Alcide!  Spin off series? That would be super great! -
B004S82OAE|4.0|I'm not actually studying for a CCNA, but just trying to gain broader knowledge.  I thought the book was very informative and useful.  There were a few parts where the organization could be improved and there was some redundancy, but overall, I would recommend this.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|The stories seem interesting. The problem is the explanations. They are very vague. Also how in the world a biology Professor just got out of the mental institute knows every weird thing happening around them. Professors are people who are expert in just one field, they don't know everything. I basically compare this series with X-files. In there, two FBI agents always talks to experts and locals to figure out a particular incident. They collect evidence. The mere imagination of the writers of FRINGE that one professor knows everything doesn't make sense for me. So I watch it when I have a free time but I don't go after it.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I'd be lying if I said it wasn't fun, but it is filled will problems and issues.  I only started to play this game to send my sister who plays the game with her guydaughter heart gems, however I can't. There are game platform issues, if you have a iPad and I have a kindle we can't send hearts, most of the time and I you can almost never visit their ponyville Postville to leave more gems.  I can't add people and can only see my sister about 25 percent of the time.  With all these problems getting hearts, you would think every time you send a heart to their princess C that is always there would send you hearts back when you send them to her, but they don't as long as you have one friend.  If you accidentally delete something you can't get get it back, you can't even buy it back until they upgrade the game. lf you accidentally push the button to hurry an action with gems you're sunk and it is easy to do.  I should have at least a hundred more gems then I do.  You can't opt out of those balloon pop games if you accidentally press it, you lose you hearts or gems.  Even though you can read what the items you can win are, most of the players are children who can't read very well yet.  They only show pictures of the ponies you can win, which is false advertising, I accidentally played and got a crappy water tower.  Most of these issues they are well aware of since they listed on their website.  Their advertising sign is annoying and when it wasn't working properly it actually said fake welcome sign.<br /><br />This is an update and it's really kind of funny, they moved a pony into another town, but there is a glitch and I have about 30 of the same pony, and she's still in the inventory and my nieces love to get more ponies, so I keep letting them get more.
B00CFA222M|2.0|I found this movie to be kinda like the UK version of it but with a lot more acting but it was missing something. You will see if you watch the UK style and that was bad. this was like it but beefier.
B005LAII44|3.0|I watched the movie at the theater I been wanting to watch it since I saw the trail for it and I will say it was good but not like the 1st. Its going to be hard to want to watch the 3rd one if it will be out or not cause to be honest it needs more action and more story line. Duke should of never been killed. Rock should of not been the main person and he was.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Lots of options and incentives, fun!  Love the awards.  Love the look.  Plays fast.  My favorite  FreeCell app.  Overall five stars!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I actually was watching it on a Spanish language channel. I know enough Spanish to know that the movie was good enough to purchase. Thanks!!
B007ZI06FE|5.0|Of course I didn't realize that they actually had a name for this style of story until recently.  I had to look Steam Punk up on the interent.  This book has a good story line, that takes place in the turn of the century London, references a few historical locations and it includes a different take on vampires and werewolves as well.  They way it is written, you can picture most of it very clearly.  I would hate to see a movie made from it and distroy my fantasy.  I couldn't put the book down and read it while I was traveling.  I was actually sorry that the plane was landing and I would need to stop reading for awhile.  I enjoyed it enough that I promptly went out and bought the sequel, Heart of Iron.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The last few books Ms. Harris has written have been &#34;okay&#34;... but more than anything, I would call them lazy. Once the True Blood series began, it felt like she gave up story telling and was just producing books to make the money and wrap up the series. It is such a shame, it could have ended in an epic fashion... but it just fizzled. I am disappointed.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I'm really sorry to write a negative review. I do not like picking apart someone else's work. But I've been disappointed with this series for awhile now. It became redundant when chapter after chapter was nothing but Sookie, buying groceries, paying bills, worrying about all of the yard work, if the guest room had clean linens. This got really old and if you removed all of that from the last two books you might have 100 pages of \\"story\\" left over.
B007XH8A8C|5.0|I love this story and read it  several times many years ago. My original copy dissappeared, so I needed to replace it with a real book. I prefer paper to electronics!<br />It is an excellent story for those who like a little history and everyday life as it used to be.<br />The copy I received, is a lovely old 40's edition. It is in excellent condition and has obviously been enjoyed!
0312330537|4.0|I loved this book. Im eagly awaiting the next. After reading this GDR inspired me to give it a shot myself. See www.boybucket.blogspot.com.au or [[ASIN:B00D0Z2TN8 The boy and the bucket]]
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Having recently finished Hosseini's latest book, I can say that I was equally enthralled by all three. I have mourned their completions and reflected on them as another might a memory of an out-of-touch friend. And The Mountains Echoed was entrancing from the opening allegory to the novel's heartfelt conclusion, when one &#34; fairy &#34; gives the gift of a happy dream to another &#34; fairy. &#34; Aside from audibly gasping at revelations every few minutes, I shed every possible kind of tear ( the happy, the sad, but mostly the ' God, that's just so beautiful ' kind ) that by this journey's end I was so exhausted and fulfilled that I slipped into a nap enriched with almost six decades of borrowed memories. For those who felt there were too many unnecessary characters, I believe they would have felt differently had they jotted down the names of characters to eliminate the pressure to remember who everyone was. I had done this ( because I have a condition that affects my memory ) and found the result interesting in a sort of &#34; six degrees of separation &#34; way ( with Nabi --- and Nabi's letter to Mr. Markos --- as the central connecting character ). I actually did not need to refer to my diagram since all of the characters made such an instant impression on me ( as I expect they will on most readers ). I pity anyone who can walk away from a Khaled Hosseini book unmoved.
B004NSVF7C|4.0|I learned a lot about book collecting from this true-crime story, and I think the author wrote in a lively and interesting style. I would read more of her work, especially if it dealt with books or book collecting.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Works as described.  I would recommend this to anyone who has forgotten the math rules for dealing with fractions.  I use it daily.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|Unlike many other reviewers I am not particularly enjoying this book. I can see where it is supposed to be funny but it isn't appealing to my sense of humour. It has been likened to Forest Gump - I wasn't a fan of that film either so you could use that as a guide. It's mildly entertaining but I'm not going out of my way to finish it.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Wonderful!  Amazon is number one on our list, as always!!  Watching the films on our wireless electronic devices is fantastic, and the price cannot be beaten!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is interesting and adult without being vulgar. I'm only on my second season, but I find it more addictive as I go through the episodes.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Not the best game ever played but still kind of fun to play when bored it is also a little addicting if you really play for long periods of time
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have loved this series - started reading it in 2005 and have recommended it to so so many of my friends. But, I could tell Ms. Harris was tiring of Sookie about two books ago, but to end it so lack luster..., During this time, Ms. Harris sold out to HBO and Alan Ball who turned it into something unrecognizable. I'm so disappointed, and then being told you have to buy ANOTHER book to learn how the characters lives continued? It all should have been closed in the final book instead of wasting pages and pages of white space on senseless dialogue. Such a fantastically original story and then to just fizzle out like the last sparkler on the 4th of July. Please. I want my money back.
0812992792|5.0|*Spoilers in the second paragraph down*<br /><br />North Korea was best described to me as an entire country in a hostage situation. Every North Korean is a hostage living in the grip of an insanely capricious and deviously paranoid terrorist regime. \\"The Orphan Master's Son,\\" the 2012 debut novel by Adam Johnson, is a powerful look at the country, the lifestyle of the people, and the terror that comes with living under a madman's rule. Johnson has written a fantastic character-driven story about a boy named Jun Do that dissects the autocratic tomfoolery of the North Korean regime. And boy is North Korea a straight up silly place. Before reading this book I recommend you search Google for an image of North Korean at night.<br /><br />The story alternates from Jun Do's travels throughout the different stratospheres of North Korean rule to the account of the interrogator who is questioning Jun Do after his imprisonment. Jun Do grows up as the son of an orphan master, and is repeatedly mistaken for someone with no family. But in a way, all North Koreans are. He becomes a soldier, a kidnapper, a sailor, a spy, a prisoner, a liar, a hero. However, like any North Korean, he is forced into deeper and deeper deceptions as he must maintain the facade as a patriotic North Korean citizen - even bringing the North Korean lie to the American heartland. Eventually his lies catch up to him and he ends up imprisoned in a North Korean torture chamber.<br /><br />Jun Do is the ultimate North Korean. He scraps for meals. He is a survivor. He is imprisoned for no reason. Brief aside: I'd have to rank a North Korean underground concentration camp as one of the top 5 worst places in the world (I would put it ahead of Waziristan and northeastern Nigeria but behind pretty much anyplace in Syria). His most valuable expertise - the ability to withstand torture and to sustain in total darkness - comes from his training as a tunnel soldier (Over the last 50 years North Korea has dug a varietyof \\"incursion tunnels\\" underneath the DMZ. The latest was found in 1990). Jun Do and the rest of North Korea grew up in the darkness. But he learns from the darkness and is able to lie his way into a position of some power and class. After all, this is a regime where the everyone lies to the next person up the totem pole, all the way to the leaders, who tell the greatest lie: that North Korea is a communist utopia.<br /><br />Johnson writes the story of Jun Do and the interrogator in steady and powerful prose, not flashy but consistently captivating. The dialogue is sometimes hilarious and the pacing is fluid. I raced through this book, and greatly enjoyed it. Of all the 2011 novels I've read, \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\" is either 1 or 1a on the list of best books. It combines a gripping plot with terrific writing and fully developed characters. Anyone with an interest in the silliness of North Korean or a deep psychological study should pick this sucker up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book! I can't wait to read the others! It has a very sarcastic humor that makes me laugh while reading it!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I was hoping for a different end, but I love Sookie, and I loved the book.  Looking for more from Charlaine Harris.
B003008RWA|1.0|don't order this.  it won't play and it won't download.  good luck getting your money back if you do order it.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This was by far the worst book of the series! I was so incredibly disappointed. I just hope the show ends better than this.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|(Spoiler alert) Sookie has come full circle by the end of this fun series. You assume at the start that she'll hook up with Sam...it took 13 books to do it, but she got there in the end. Although I am a huge fan of the True Blood tv series, I much prefer the story lines Charlaine Harris comes up with in the books, they'd probably be slightly more PG than R if they were directly translated to screen! Great one liners and fast paced story lines (not dragging one little plot point out for several chapters) are other reasons that the Sookie Stackhouse series is well worth a read.

B00BB8RKH6|1.0|One of the worst movies I've seen this year. A boring, slow moving movie! I was expecting a thriller, but instead got a movie about a drunken drug addicted pilot. Take my advice and skip this one!

B000002MZ9|5.0|As one music critic said; 'imagine it's 1965 and a supposed over-the-hill Chuck Berry runs into the Rolling Stones and they decide to make a record together, minus Jagger. The Stones then inspire & push Chuck to the limit and smoke his songs into oblivion.'<br /><br />Well that's exactly what's happened here. And contrary to what some reviewers claim, Crazy Horse is a solid but overrated & plodding backup band and they got nothing on Pearl Jam. For proof just compare this CD with the fine Ragged Glory and you'll see what I mean. The crunch & seismic power they give to this CD is awesome. At certain points Neil & Pearl sound like they're going to careen and go off the edge with their amps exploding. Truly a marriage made in heaven! It also helps that this was one of the first HDCD releases. The only thing that could've improved this was if they included covers of Neil classics such as Like a Hurricane, Cortez the Killer, Powderfinger, Cinnamon Girl, etc.<br /><br />And Neil, one of the most underrated guitarists, gives some of his most memorable & exciting solos here. To me this ranks right up there with the Stooges Raw Power, the MC5's Kick Out the Jams, and anything by Led Zep, Deep Purple, Metallica, and whoever else you could think of as one of the hardest & heaviest rock records ever made. You can take that to the bank.<br /><br />By the way, ignore all the production complaints; this is a Neil Young CD not a Jackson Browne CD.
0547848412|5.0|I loved this book....and found it very thought provoking.  An allegorical tale...well told..and utterly magical...I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good story to take them into another time and place.
B0030B624E|5.0|How can you beat this movie? Woody, Eisenberg, the luscious Emma Stone, and adorable Abigail Breslin. One of my favortie movies to watch over and over...
B004YW4L5K|5.0|While it maintains all the main highlights of American Gods, this version has just enough different that you get a new feeling after reading it. I can appreciate the changes he had to make for general consumption, but I feel this is my more favored version of the two
B0026NZR98|5.0|Why can't something like this happen to me? I wouldn't mind a 4 year sabbatical from life to spend learning survival skills alone on an island. Okay, I'd bring a Satellite phone along too in case I needed to order some pizza and a girl, but otherwise, oh the life...
B000E41MS6|5.0|Loved this series when I watched it on Netflix and I finally bought it. Love Eccleston as The Doctor and Billie Piper is brilliant as Rose. Sad that Eccleston only got the one series :(
B00992CF6W|5.0|made spending time with my daughter more awesome I would like to thank you very much. reminds me of the legos I loved as a kid.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I like to play all sort of games and when I read the reviews for this one by adults who were playing it, I thought it  I would give it a try. This is not a game for adults, however. It's very pretty and sweet but offers no challenges whatsoever. Glad it was free (ish).
0062213423|5.0|well it's just a book, it delivered really quick and it was in perfect condition, excellent gift for anyone who likes the band
B008602KQI|4.0|Actors were well chosen & played there rolls well. Graphics were good, especially the chariot scene were it seemed the flames were emitting from there costumes. The host for the interviews was outstanding, giving you the impression he was sincere when in actuality he was a classic bore
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This had been the best game I have ever played. The content is first rate and the graphics are superb!
0307476073|2.0|I understand the desire to test your inner strength and fortitude in physical activities. I've spent a summer hiking the back country of Yellowstone National Park. I've read A Walk in the Woods; Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail, by Bill Bryson and Into Thin Air: a Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster by Jon Krakauer, and thoroughly became wrapped up in the recounting of the events. Each of these authors were well prepared and planned for their trips. Ms. Strayed simply read a book about the PCT while she was going through a divorce and having an affair and decided she needed to get away from everyone. She tried to link the need to hike the trail to her mother's death which had happened 3-4 years prior. Her story telling seemed to be just that, story telling. The account of bear sightings, rattlesnakes encounters and general near misses with snow and desert settings without adequate hydration, indicates a very ill planned hiking adventure. Thus the title of my review: Alice in Wonderland. The story is too fantastical to be completely true. No doubt she walked some distance on the trail, however the naval gazing of this author is very similar to Eat,Pray,Love and Julie/Julia. These books were written to \\"find myself\\", but mostly the books sound whining and self serving. Wild reminds me of the truth which was learned about Three Cups of Tea, some elements were true but there was much which was stretched to make it a work of fiction.<br />Two stars for believability, maybe three stars for attempting to introduce the idea of hiking as a way to learn about this magnificent country.
B0027MJU00|5.0|An incredible writer. Every word is perfectly chosen to evoke the writer's intended mood, emotion, or reaction. And Flynn never fails to remind you that your first reaction is almost always wrong.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|I give it three stars. It was a bit too long but enjoyable throughout. I just expected more, but for a computer rendered film it is outstanding.
B00C8985DU|5.0|I am big in the rock collectables that have been coming out over the years, but this \\"Wings Over America\\"  box set is probably the nicest I've ever owned or seen.  It's outstanding in so many ways.  The attention to detail and quality is suburb. This thing is heavy as the slipcase is covered in black fabric with various cloth \\"Wings\\" back stage passes placed on both sides along with other wing stickers.  Inside is the real treasure which includes a beautiful book of Linda McCarney's photo's from the tour.  A Wings itinerary book which is full of interesting behind the scenes documents of a working tour.  Included in this is several pockets of reproduced concert tickets, invitations, backstage passes and a program they probably sold on the tour.  This also houses the remastered album plus bonus disc from San Francisco's Cow Palace and the rare \\"Wings Over The World\\" Television Special from 1976 (I remember watching it as a kid) on DVD.  As if this was not enough also included is a book of sketches by Artist Humphrey Ocean who was commissioned by McCartney to document all aspects of the tour through his drawings, this also comes with an interesting typed log of his thoughts and encounters on the tour.  The forth book is a history of Wings with even more photos from the tour.  This is a really special box set and worth every penny.  Now if only I could get into a time machine and go back to see this show when it was in Atlanta!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I use this app all the time when I am surfing the web on my kindle fire hd. It works quite well for the most part and I am a googlephile so most anything Google is OK in my book.
1423165691|5.0|I am a aspiring artist who has admired Disney animation ever since I was a child. This book is a giant sketchbook full of concepts and character designs of some of the most iconic of Disney characters. I first saw this book at a recent trip to Disneyland, hidden in a shop full of Disney art. It was selling for 50 dollars there, so I checked my phone and found it going for 30 dollars here on amazon. I think you know which one I bought.
0425252868|5.0|Learning the experiences and perspectives of German pilots was a rare treat. This book is so much more then a single moment in time. The experiences leading up to and following the actions of Franz Stigler and the crew of \\"Ye Olde Pub\\" is very compelling. This is a must read for all aviation history and general history fans.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|I liked RED and the stars that made it an enjoyable movie.<br />It was fun for me & my wife.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Movie fell short of a good story. But the acting and action scenes were pretty good, especially Tom Cruise's \\"Bullit\\" driving thru the city. Jack Reacher is supposed to be 6'5\\"-250 lbs: T Cruise...??? @ 5'6\\" maybe?????
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A very good book.  This story is written in such a way that makes it hard<br /> to put down. I enjoy reading Nicholas Sparks books.
0061122416|5.0|So I have decided to start reading books as a way of improving my English. I figured this was a great book to start with. I also bought moby dick since its a popular book. so far so good
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book will grip you from the first paragraph and keep you wanting more past the last pages. The story is exciting and well though out. I can't wait to read what comes next in the shift series.
B008NMT684|4.0|He appreciates the recognition he gets at the end.  He prefers to use this app over the ones loaded on his nabi.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I tried to download this app for my phone, but it kept crashing..it's great on my Kindle Fire though! :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome and all but we need redstone ,pistons,levers,buttons,iron doors,and other PC stuff so please make this a  update.We will all be happy and have fun and also online multiplayer.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Wonderful reading on a cold rainny afternoon.  We must not let true genius become a bad word or let power overtake imagination.  Tesla was truly a man ahead of his time, the modern DeVinci.
B00756GRUE|4.0|I like it, I recommend this product. It is the same as Amazon description said. This has been my first product bought in Amazon and my first Seiko too. I am sure it will not be the last one. Now, it is time to enjoy it. The quality of the product will be checked after using, it is so soon to judge the quality.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Story was good. But ended to abruptly wish there was more to it. I don't like to be left hanging..
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|the game has very good graphics and relaxing sounds. it teaches you to be aware of marine life and the importance of its biodiversity. it is fun gane worth your time.
B008Y7BE7E|4.0|I have to say , this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  It had action, a bit of tension and lots of comedic value.  The movie was well cast. The actors were pefect for their respective roles. If you like movies that don't require thinking and are entertaining with a few laughs, this movies is for you. Just don't expect a serious drama or Oscar winner.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I love this book and I enjoyed the movie. The movie is a lot like Sleeping with the Enemy but with more attractive stars. Julia Roberts is much more convincing playing an abused woman. When watching Sleeping with the Enemy, I was on edge and scared for her character. I didn't feel the same about Julianne's character but she was still good. If you like Sleeping with the Enemy and/or Nicholas Sparks, you'll enjoy this movie. Josh is hot but not as hot as usual. There are a lot of cute moments. I'll definitely watch it again.
B000005RS0|5.0|What's not to say that hasn’t already been said?  Tina turner at her best with songs that are timeless and far superior to music that is currently being released.  This is one tough LADY with a lot of feeling.
1742200508|5.0|In some ways, this almost feels like two different guide books.  The section on London contains full color maps and many photos (printed on non-photographic paper) and is a joy to browse through.  But, the rest of the guide book has very limited use of color consisting almost entirely of just blue and black ink.  Those two colors are used to great effect, but it seems like such a letdown after having browsed through the London section.<br /><br />As for the content, it's very good and well organized.  I'm not sure I'd want to lug this thing with me on my trip, but I would definitely use it before I go.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Till Haswell comes out this has been the choice for the best bang for your buck.  Check out tomshardware.com.  This CPU has been on it's list as the best CPU for just above $220.  I don't expect it to drop in price that much in the next few years.<br /><br />I'm currently cooling it using a Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO - CPU Cooler with 120mm PWM Fan.  It does get hot but still performs like it should.  I'm not overclocking it but I may wait till the weather gets cooler.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Right when I started reading this book, it grabbed my attention. That's when I knew that this was the book I've been waiting for. I highly recommend reading this book.
B003DS3GC0|5.0|The plot and acting are great.  The movie is interesting and enjoyable.  The language is a little rough but it fits the movie.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|Fantastic book with full of scientific facts, logic and references. As always Richard has expressed his ideas very clearly without sparing any room for metaphysical or superstitious ideas. Belief always dangles from the thread of doubt! Shelton Ranasinghe
B006RXQ800|5.0|But this was totally awesome. Great portrayal of a time period, and surprising history of a city I thought I knew well. I was also surprised and impressed by Cameron Diaz' skillful performance of an unfamiliar role.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I've been wheat free and also restricting carbs now for just under 3 months, I just finished the book finally last night.  As someone that has done Atkins dieting for the last decade plus, whenever I started to push the upper limit on what I'd allow myself to weigh (about 210), I knew the value of restricting carbs and eating lots of veggies and meat.  However, what I'd not realized where the destructive qualities of gluten intolerance in the body, and that losing weight wasn't the only goal.<br /><br />I've lost about 22.5 pounds or so, however I've also added exercise, so that has been an adjustment, but I'd also not been as restricted on the carbs, allowing myself some fruit and beans, which I normally didn't do when using the Atkins protocol, in any case, the reason this book is so important has much more to do than just losing weight and looking and feeling better.<br /><br />The change in my mental outlook, my brain function, has been very noticeable, for the last couple years I've gone through the most challenging season of my life, discarded by my wife, my church family, excommunicated, and basically on the verge of suicide, I had been fighting back against unspeakable odds.  First challenge for me was to decide whether Jesus and god were real, I decided they aren't real, but imaginary beings, and what does that have to do with a book about wheat elimination?  A lot actually.<br /><br />Let me explain, if you except that evolution is true, and that there is no god (or that if there is a god, it's a deist one), then realizing that we have evolved to eat a certain way and that no amount of prayer or asking for miracles is going to get you healthy, AND that you only live once and that's IT,,,,THEN living a healthy lifestyle with a good diet is very important.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many people, in my old religious life, just ate horrible diets and believed that when they got cancer or heart disease that they'd just pray it away or die in \\"god's timing\\" and go to heaven and be happy.  It's very sad and fatalistic when seen from the outside.<br /><br />Now that I've rejected that lie, and seen reality for what it is, I'm very concerned about doing the best I can to be healthy, eating healthy foods and living a long and healthy life, so I can enjoy my grandkids and such.  This book helped me see how not paying attention to diet can take 40 years off your life.<br /><br />Are those cookies, cakes and breads worth 30 or 40 years?  Are they worth 10 years?<br /><br />The evidence that this book provides was enough for me to believe, but really, at the end of the day, my own body's feedback is enough.  I look ten years younger and I've only been wheat free for 2 and a half months.  My body isn't as bloated, my joints feel better, and my depression is gone.  Really.  I still get discouraged, life is still difficult, but what a difference, and it might be so of the other things out of my diet too, like deep fried foods and sugar, which I've also eliminated, but whatever it is, or the combination, it's huge.  The difference is life changing, life altering and amazing.<br /><br />Now, as a side note, I'd like to point out how horrible and evil or own government is.  It's partially responsible for the massive killing off of millions of people, either directly or early in life, because the government has promoted a false and destructive diet as \\"healthy\\".  It's really nasty, when you stop and really think about it, the health care crisis we have, the billions and trillions we spend on unnecessary surgery and medicines, all because of pushing wheat on the population.  Proper diet could and would solve a vast majority of the health issues we deal with as a nation, and pay dearly for in wasted time and money.<br /><br />These are some of the reason's I'm both an atheist and an anarchist, the government and the church, together, destroy life and liberty, to a degree that's sick.  See some of my other reviews for some more books on these subjects.<br /><br />So, I give the strongest recommendation for this book than any I've ever given, if you read one book this year, or in this decade, this is it.  This book will change your life if you read it and follow it.<br /><br />Now, I do have one critique, that's the after the reasoning chapters, the author starts out with some sample recipes and gives some good things to substitute in meal planning.  This is not good for anyone that's wanting to lose 30+ pounds (it's fine for people already doing great and who don't require large weight losses to get healthy).  Why?  Because the best way to lose weight when you are very overweight is by keeping it VERY simple.  Eat the same basic foods, make life VERY stress free.  Don't worry about recipes or counting calories, just omit carbs and eat until you're full, and drink lots of water, you'll watch the weight fall away, even without exercise.<br /><br />With exercise added, you'll lose weight so fast that you'll just be amazed, and this is what helps you over the humps of cravings, seeing the scale go down and down.<br /><br />Now, for those that aren't trying to lose a bunch of weight, the recipes of course are fine, and I see there is a whole book of them to purchase, so I'm not saying it's a bad idea to find creative things to make for dinner, I'm saying, if you're goal is to lose weight, forget anything that isn't very simple.  Trust me on this.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say I did watch Forks over Knives, and I appreciated the critique presented here about eliminating meat, it goes back to the evolution of our species and how the hunter gatherer period of evolution developed what we adapted to for optimum health.  I don't believe that eliminating meat is the healthiest ( I know it can be done in a healthy diet, that's not the point).  Eliminating wheat and other grains, sticking to eating a diet of things that you can either grow or kill is going to give you the best health, and the longest life span possible, and give you the healthiest feeling in your body.<br /><br />Why this has been a hidden \\"mystery\\" and why the church and the government like to suppress knowledge isn't hard to figure out, it's profitable.  Don't be a sucker, reject what is false and embrace what is empirical truth.n these subjects.<br /><br />So, I give the strongest recommendation for this book than any I've ever given, if you read one book this year, or in this decade, this is it.

B00847KFDS|5.0|This is classic Fogerty and it is a pleasure to her how different artist treat his songs but also still have Fogerty singing with them. The 2 new songs are great.
B00C4YZ12C|3.0|It's not a bad game.  The background music and graphic style is reminiscent of Gradius but overall, there wasn't a lot of replayability.  Your ship just constantly shoots and you keep moving it around with your finger to shoot the other stuff.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|It works as you would suppose it should.  That is success for an app.  I hope that they keep it updated.
B00AIJP9BS|2.0|but the ball was nearly impossible to control.  Most of my &#34;Kicks&#34; went out of bounds no matter what I did.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|one of my favorite hidden object games.  thankful for the hints on where to go.  after a while I got better at remembering where things were.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|As much as I liked the book, i waited 6 years for the book after being told it was nearly written when Feast for Crows was published.  Given that, I found some of the story threads disappointing and some didn't seem to go anywhere. I am hoping Winds of Winter is better
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book was a sorry ending to the Sookie Stackhouse story. And, yes, while I may not agree with how it ended exactly, when I say it's bad, I'm referring more to the writing. It was written very lazily, almost like the author just wanted to get it over with. I was really looking forward to a fantastic farewell from Sookie - too bad.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I found this book thought provoking, easy to read, and compelling. I can't wait to discuss in my book club.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It is like a more adventurous and more intelligent forest gump story with all the history this man impacts in this book. I loved reading it and it was like I was on the ride with him. I loved that he hated talk of religion and politics but that he had an impact on alot of politics.<br /><br />Great adventure story with lots of twists and turns - it is humorous, and adventurous. Great Read
B00BC24NT4|5.0|For le Carre fans, he is in top form in this novel, using his ease of dialogue, unique language and lush descriptors.  For those more new to le Carre, take your time, this is vintage le Carre writing.  He assumes we are intelligent readers and can follow his story and dialogue.  With each chapter we learn more about his style and phrasing, making the reading more and more enjoyable with each new page.  This is reading for the thinking person.
B00AW57L96|4.0|This book was surprisingly intriguing. Recognisably Australasian in flavour but it touched on some interesting questions about the complexity of women's roles, and relationships, in the modern world. Twist at the end risked being a cliche but successfully avoided that I think. A book for women in their 'middle years'.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I was looking for a case that would allow me to keep my lens hood on my Lumix fz200. This one is a little larger than most bags designed for this class of camera and fits perfectly.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Good app,  predicts lots of stuff and is a descent keyboard. All keyboards are bad but this one is the least bad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game really no lie it is cool because it is in Tokyo it is awesome really good
044022425X|5.0|great story line. you definitely need to read all the book together from this series. I rarely read all whole series, I never got tired of the story line.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Peoples' tastes change over time. Many times change is a good thing. In this case it is great. I like this album very much, but that doesn't mean I no longer like my CCR albums and Blue Ridge Rangers albums. They will still be listened to and will be enjoyed. I can understand that not everyone is as happy with this album as I am. It's called different strokes.
0385335997|5.0|great story line. you definitely need to read all the book together from this series. I rarely read all whole series, I never got tired of the story line.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I've been waiting for this book since last year. I loved it. Although I must admit I was a little sad about the final outcomes in some relationships, I think. all in all, it ended well.
B0040NOWY8|5.0|They've never failed a BluRay movie burn.  It's always something else that creates a new drink coaster.  The compatibility on these also seems good.  All my burns play on 3 different devices + Oppo.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|What a bloated, convoluted mess, and I enjoy complex films. While I'll give the filmmakers props for their ambitions, ultimately none of them were attained. What an immense waste of time and money (mine and the filmmakers, actors, etc.)
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Am not yet done reading this book, but so far I am enjoying it and catching my full attention and thinking of taking the rest of \\"The Mortal Instruments\\" book!!!
B00B4804KS|5.0|Not really, because it was the original; but the 3D graphics were amazing and it seemed like I was watching scenes that I never saw before because of the detail and color.  I highly recommend this version!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was totally engaging. If you like to solve mysteries then you won't go wrong with this purchase. Discover it's secrets for yourself. Such a charming presentation.
B003WTE886|5.0|This album is complete with beautiful meaningful handwritten songs! This is great for any Taylor fan (swifties) or any pop-country lovers!Not to meantion how GORGEOUS Taylor looks on the cover! Highly recommended and I would definitely buy it again!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I really liked this book I liked the ending a fitting way for Sookie to be happy. Not sure why others gave this such a bad review.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|Just downloaded the album this morning and listened to it on the way to work. I got a Tripod vibe off it, which is a good thing! The album as a whole has the good old grungy/slightly eerie feel that's so trademark-Alice in Chains, so I'm pretty happy with my purchase!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Tarantino's best movie since Pulp Fiction! I found it to be one of the best acted movies ever. stellar performances from all!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is good to have on my Kindle Fire. Makes it very quick and easy to check the weather for the day when I wake up in the morning. It saves my current location so I don't have to type it in each time but it is also easy to change to a new city/state if I have to.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I am playing this on a daily basis but without buying credits it is a very slow game. I have 10 million game dollers but need credit notes to buy land, these are very slow in coming if you are not prepared to buy them. Also having to paste your achievments on facebook to recieve rewards does annoy your friends.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It earened 5 stars. it's really good. It has good vocabulary and  it's really long. Good sentences it's just great
B007IK44CK|4.0|This was what you'd expect from an MI movie.  It was interesting, fast paced, and had enough twists and turns to surprise you from time to time.  Acting and story line were good.  Entertaining, but not worth watching twice.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I read this at the recommendation of a friend. I was immediately drawn into the characters and subject matter. I found it to be one of those &#34;can't put it down&#34; reads. Highly recommended.
B00AG297GK|5.0|If you've had a bad day and need something so irreverent that it can take your mind off reality and leave you laughing, this is the movie.  It's SO politically incorrect that it's difficult not to be offended, but they poke fun at governments all over the world, so it seems fair.  The dialog was so loaded with humor, I know I missed some opportunities to laugh.  I'll watch it again, the next time I need that kind of diversion.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Read and loved every Sookie Stackhouse Novel. Truly sorry to see the series end. Will look forward to the &#34;update&#34; Charline Harris promised us!
B003G4W49C|5.0|While I along with most people have a distaste for Orson Scott Card and his beliefs, I must say that this book is amazing. I read this when I was a kid and have read it probably 5 more times since then, I always come back to this book when I run out of things to read. And now that they are making a movie out of it, it's an even better opportunity to read it. While I'm sure the movie will do the book justice and it looks to have some quality casting, I would definitely recommend reading the book beforehand. There are things in the book that I know will not appear in the movie, and certain backstories that definitely help people understand the characters more than a movie would be able to.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|\\"The Alchemyst (The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas F l a m m e l ) is a wonderful tale! Michael Scott out did himself this is an amazing series.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Love this album and I can't stop listening to it. The Vinyl sounds great as well. Definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Daft Punk, people who don't listen to a lot of daft might take a few listens to warm up to it. But it's a great album overall.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Awesome. Great new idea and definitely worth the watch. Character development, action, subtlety, not a dull moment at all. I love the writing!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|An interesting look at the impact that any one family member has on the others.  And how unpredictable LIfe is.
B004VFMCWE|4.0|This is a tough one to watch for anyone who felt a sense of loss in the '90s, the sinking feeling that the new world had no room for many of us. &#34;Falling Down&#34; takes that feeling and turns it into a kind of horror film, with Douglas (fantastic, by the way) as a kind of Frankenstein's monster shambling around L.A. looking for kind faces but learning ugly truths—and becoming twice as ugly in the process.
B005TBN04S|1.0|Well, I'll never get back that 1 hour 1/2 of my life. Should have opted for my hubby's route, sleeping through it.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|If you don't already like Wes Anderson movies, this one might not be for you. Like &#34;The Life Aquatic ...,&#34; &#34;Moonrise Kingdom&#34; reimagines someone's past and displays it like interactive dioramas. Great fun for the faithful, maybe a bit too precious/stylized for others.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have played the game on the computer and I thought it was fun so I got the kindle version and I loved it!  There are all these new towers and new upgrades for old ones.  It just is a little more complex than the one on the computer so it might be a little hard for young children.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|Once more, Springsteen proves that his &#34;castaways&#34; are as good as (or better than) most other pop stars' &#34;greatest hits.&#34;
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Keeps you guessing at every turn. Couldn't put it down until it was done, and still wanted more. I loved it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I enjoyed this book way better than the last one. It was a great ending although I am a big Eric fan.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Great movie, from start to finish I felt immersed in a dream of what may be. The story is fabulous and the cinematography breathtaking.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Are you kidding? This movie is a classic. Call me nostalgic, but I have no negative feedback. A romantic dramedy you can watch guilt free.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|I love the idea of being connected through our actions good and bad. I also want to believe in cause and effect.
1623420148|5.0|Read this book last week. LOVED it!!! Told from the guy's POV. I was laughing out loud and reading snippets to my husband a few times and he was snorting too. Want something diff but that rocks your socks? Get this!
B0063M22QO|5.0|A lot of fun, requiring both manual dexterity and thought.  Really enjoyable.  My wife also enjoys these, as well.  I would like to see more of these!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|The first experiment I tried worked, though I did not try them all yet. Some useful ideas in here that are not found in yhe typical metaphysical books.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I love this game but once I got to level 13-01 it won't let me do anything but die so other than that I can't get any farther the game is great :/
B008YRVW0I|2.0|I played this on my iPad & computer and loved it. I got it for my husband to play on his Kindle fire.  BUT it is TOO SMALL on the Kindal fire. Not fun playing it on a mini screen. Now I'm deciding whether to get him the new Kindle Fire HD or an iPad.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I ordered this case because it was the cheapest I had seen online. NEVER AGAIN. It is not waterproof whatsoever. It came with no instructions. I feel like this was a cheap copy, and now I am $25 shorter. Also, I can't even use it as just a case because NO ONE CAN HEAR ME WHEN I CALL. It also sounds like s*** if you don't have it on speaker. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER
B009LYQE2E|5.0|All i can say is that they are really good quality but are small. Thats not a problem for me though. 5/5
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Rigid and a thneed the other day and she Thomasville and the other day and a thneed song and a new comment by the other hand in the kitchen and the game is santa Barbara and a cc and the lorax Thomasville to l travel insurance company bossy r r us a cc to
B00C70FGIM|5.0|The most perfect album I've encountered since Karnivool's masterpiece, \\"Sound Awake\\" (and maybe Katatonia's \\"Night Is The New Day\\").<br />It is an album that plays by its own rules. It is a mature, unique and mind bending piece of music that works on the listener on multiple levels. This is far  beyond \\"progressive\\" music per se, beyond odd time signatures or non standard guitar tunings. These elements are there, sure, but the music flows so naturally and beautifully that you won't care. It is one of these album you can be immersed in from start to finish without ever thinking about skipping a song. At first it is the amazing vocal melodies that you hold on to. You glide and soar with them (and some soft guitar lines) above the complex, pulsing, ever changing and somewhat  enigmatic underlying music. On repeated listens you discover more and more depth and details in this musical terrain. Try it yourself.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This is Daft Punk's most personal album. They recorded the entire thing on analog - live, with real instruments, in a recording studio. It takes you back in time to a time and place that kicked ass.<br /><br />ALSO - FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT EDM: Daft Punk is remixing many (if not all) of the songs from this album for the EDM genre. They released this version first because it's a (powerful) personal statement, but don't cry, you'll get your EDM.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is an awesome game! It is a fun combination of some old school games such as Galaga and Moon Crest! I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes retro games.
B00B4804KS|4.0|I really didn't expect a whole lot out of this movie.  Most conversions are &#34;so-so.&#34;  Not so with this one.  Other than a few scenes where up-close items are a little fuzzy, they did a good job with the depth of this film.  Really made a difference.
B0085A9J18|5.0|All the action scene in the movie is well choreographed.  You must see this movie if you are a fan of martial art movies.
0439023491|5.0|Title says it all, very creative writer and a great story. Read all three adn Would love the series to continue. alas, I guess I'll just have to read them again. They are that good!
B005LAIH54|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who like watching a film that is well dialogued.  The special effect of this movie is great.
B005BQTUVI|5.0|There's art, and then there's commerce.  The idea is to make money and entertain.  I found it wholly disingenuous for Guillermo Del Toro to complain throughout his \\"reclaiming Mimic\\" featurette, that he never got to make the movie he intended but that this was a good compromise but that he hated compromising, especially when his vision was better, but this still isn't the movie he set out to make, but it's close enough, but even so, he hated the ending and.......whatever.  There's a way around that, it's called a remake.  Directors do it all the time.  Stop whining.<br />As incredibly overstated by Del Toro, the ideas he didn't get to include in Mimic wouldn't necessarily have made for a better film.  It's also a slap in the face to suggest we fell in love with the wrong film because it was more Hollywood, rather than the conceptual piece he had planned.  And that's why I find it odd that this is called the director's cut.  I don't know why Del Toro endorsed this new version when clearly he still isn't happy with it.  I don't think it matters much because this is still the movie I fell in love with and the version I'm keeping in my collection (Guillermo Del Toro notwithstanding).<br /><br />I've always found this movie to be sufficiently eerie, the shadowy figures that look human but aren't (how easy it would be to pass one and not think it wasn't human until it was too late).  I like the characters, the situations, the ill fated investigation underground, the fabulously first gore-ific killing followed by an inelegant exit down the drain.  Part mystery, part horror, part action-flick, this is a seamless piece of entertainment.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I'm so glad this game is now available for kindle! Plenty of fun to be had. Many cars and maps and they're always adding new stuff. Get it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Can't be this show!  It keeps you on your toes the whole way through!!  Wouldn't miss it.  I always look forward to watching it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag holds ALL of my camera equipment. Built solid and designed with functionality in mind. It has my compartments and spacers (in the inside) to properly secure all of your equipment. Definitely impressed with the bag and have since recommended to several family members and friends. Without a doubt a great buy!
B001XUIBNO|4.0|I also enjoyed the two Jakes the sequel maybe even the prequel to this flick. In any case this is a good watch follow it up with a viewing of the 2 jakes.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|This was an incredible story. Also visually incredible. It's quite sad however. But very well done. I wouldn't recommend this for younger ones.
0679805273|5.0|This is a great graduation gift. Great words of wisdom and a fun gift to give a graduate! Love it!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I would like it if I had it...it never downloaded and so I don't have it to rate it..what to do
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|Still a lot of fun to watch!! Barbra at her best. Great cast and great costumes! Great songs. A good time was had by all!
B006G2NVCA|5.0|This soundtrack is some of Trent Reznor's best work.<br />A must for any NIN fan, or someone who follows Trent's work.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Not much to say about this other than it works and I have yet to have a negative experience with it. The compound is never runny or flakey. 5 stars definitely.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was really a fun and addicting game.<br />Which is also it's setback. The levels pose a semi challenging experience but not to a point of no progression. So once you start, it's VERY difficult to stop. I couldn't give it give stars because it mainly just didn't last as long as I'd hoped it would.<br /><br />But it's by far one of the better games available on the market today if enjoy a nice challenge.
B007857FOO|5.0|This was a great item as, collectors would love it... I am a big fan of twilight, and I liked this movies the best it was so intense.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I didn't get it the first time I watched this, maybe because I may have blinked and missed vital key points of the movie.  I watched this twice and didn't feel like watching it again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I started playing this game  on my son's tablet and had to download it. I can't stop playing this game.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Some areas of the film just does not make sense unless you were from the late 80's watching Arnold's movies.  Then it gets predictable.  Nothing you have never seen before.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The second book isn't quite as compelling as the first, but what could be? Still, it's a good summer read.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is very good and addictive,it's original and it gives the feel that you are the mayor of the town enjoy
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|Love the revamped Beard!  Picked up where they left off from 'X'...'Submerged' would be Top 40 gold if the airwaves weren't controlled by the American Idolist's and their ilk.  If you're partial to the low end you're going to love Dave Meros's bass guitar/pedal work.  Having picked up a Moog Taurus III bass pedal set and Ampeg SVT-VR/SVT-810AV last year, I'm thoroughly enjoying trying to play along with this cd...much to the chagrin of my neighbors!  Love the new vocalist, Neal Morse makes a cameo, and the playing is top notch.  Prog fans will not be disappointed!
B008OTTSX4|5.0|Sometimes I am in the mood to listen to an album with a variety of artists and when I am in that mood, this is a great choice.
B002N2LEVM|5.0|Just  great series overall!! The show started off a bit slow but sure picked up and made the characters more intense and added more depth. Who is Echo? Who is Echo now? Follow the Gril who can be anyone and see where it leads. Its really worth the journey.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I would definitely recommend this CD to any of my friends.  She has such a lovely voice.  I remember the first time I heard her sing &#34;Somewhere Over The Rainbow&#34; - my all time favorite version of one of my favorite songs.  I'm so glad she was &#34;discovered&#34; and we all can enjoy the beauty of her voice.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Read the first two back to back and pre ordered the third.  Definitely page turners! Good characters and story line.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My husband and I have watched this movie several times (we're in our late 60s).  My son and his wife have a copy (30s).  Many of both our friends love this movie so I would say your age doesn't matter.  Definitely would recommend this movie to anyone I know.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|When my cell went in the shop for repairs, I needed a replacement alarm clock. My Alarm Clock to the rescue!!
B009NY43NY|3.0|Didn't end the way I would have liked it to.  Not a lot of action.  I realized the author was trying to tie up all the loose ends and wrap up every character's story, but it wasn't very exciting.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Great writing!  Now, I can finally watch the film, and see if it holds up.  Usually films don't manage to do justice to such a gorgeous book.
B002VRZEYM|2.0|Interesting information but completely omits the effects on the costs and availability of a wide choice of foods. Producer's political biases are much too evident.<br /><br />Use of corn for ethanol and its effects on the cost of food and environmental effects are omitted because these are developments subsequent to the film's production.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Love One Republic. Ryan Tedder is such an awesome singer and songwrite. LOve some of the unique sounds on this CD. Can't wait to see them in concert this summer
B008JF8O9M|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how well this app worked and I printed out several documents to test this app.<br />If you are trying to print from your phone or tablet it works great!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is the best!!!!! I have like 12 or11 world's . You should get this game. There is so much to do and see. You can make houses , towns, buildings tunnels and much much more. The only thing is that monsters, animals, and night time are only in survivel mode .I wish it was in creative mode too.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Granted I just started today but so far a great game .you have to talk to each person in each room to receive your missions usually hidden objects to earn rewards. only in level 3 right now though.but  gonna keep going:)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoye this game.  It is a great past time while traveling to and from.  There are several choices of playing the game!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It was good, no great to listen to the discussions by those who have mastered American English.  Its a great picture
1451668945|3.0|Mary Higgins Clark has been my favorite author for many years.  I was a little disappointed in this book.  It wasn't her usual suspensful story line.  It was just an &#34;OK&#34; book.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It is a wonderful portrail of the mutual respect and dependence that exists between the boy Pi and a wild animal.  Pi and Richard Parker are both dependent on each other and they realize the fact.  Wonderful story. Of the way Pi actually loves the tiger.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game can't wait for another one to come out. Wish it was longer. Graphics are good. Keep them coming.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is easy to use and has good information.  I would recommend it as a good source for local weather.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|How can ya go wrong with such a stellar lineup of classic progressive hard rockers?  Everyone's talent and skill blasts through the tracks, backing and bringing endless strength to the writings of Glenn Hughes and Joe Bonamossa.  Shirley's consistent production of this quartet is honorable in all three albums, doing perfect justice to the art these masters create.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm gonna start of saying that this game is so awesome but I'm just wondering. They just submitted they new update 0.7.0 and they said android would get it by June 6th. Does this mean that people who use the kindle fire hd will get it on June 6th or have to wait a little longer? Please reply
B009GI8J1O|2.0|Interesting creative approach --- six short stories, five of which are split in the middle, the last halves of which are read in reverse order following the complete sixth story.  The author admittedly has done a good job in utilizing different \\"voices\\" in each story.  But while all this is interesting, the splits disrupt the continuity of the overall story consequently taking it nowhere.  The stories are linked loosely but even those links become somewhat difficult to follow through this web of fractured stories.  Suggestion to anyone who is about to read this book (and forget the movie, that's a disaster): After reading the first portion of a story, skip to the second half of that story and so work your way through all the stories (the good old time-proven approach to reading).  I wish I had done that; perhaps it might have all hung together better.  As it was, when I came to the second part of a story I found myself going back to the end of the first part to recall where the story left off.  All the positive hype about this book and its unique structure strikes me as a bit of a pseudo-intellectual delusion, a la \\"the king's new clothes\\".
B006M4F67A|3.0|This is a great game when it works.  Frequently locks up on note 2.  Five stars if that is fixed.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is an awesome game!!! I'm like, so addicted to it(not in a bad way). However,I don't like the fact that the game takes a couple days the re-install. Like, the game has these themes, which comes with collecting mini icons and stuff. It takes a couple days to change the theme, so I kinda miss out on the fun mini missions. Nevertheless, I still like the game!
0920236251|1.0|This is an excellent story by an excellent author. When I saw the paperback for $1.99, I thought I would get an extra copy for my class library. It arrived today, about 3 inches square. Why? Do I now need to scroll down and search for the size of all paperbacks that I am interested in?  This really is misleading, and frustrating as well. When a size is so small that it would be considered abnormal for the item ( paperback books), it should be clearly and prominently displayed. It is going back as this is useless for me to keep.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|Very entertaining, had seen this movie at the theathers and knew it was one for my collection. A movie worth seeing and owning.
B004I744AS|4.0|Easy to use. I like that it gives reference to usage of a word (ie: country of origin, context, etc.)Ads can be a bit annoying but they don't deter me from using it.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Okay, so it starts out just after the civil war. Has plenty of excitment, he gets transported to another world and he trying to walk as there is not as much gravity as he is use to. I say it was a delightful movie. Pretty much something for the whole family. Its supenseful and I like the ending, its not quite what it seems but will not spoil the ending for those have not seen. Yes, very worthwilde movie. Good entertainment.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|The best puzzles ever!  I played all the packs in 2 days and am now playing them again.  The graphics are exquisite.  My husband also downloaded the game and loves it too.  I especially like the Metal pack and the abstract designs.  After I finish each design, I sit looking at it and admiring its beauty before going on to the next image.<br /><br />I looked to see if you had any more design packs but couldn't find any.  Do you have plans on continuing to add new puzzles?
193700788X|4.0|I am about halfway thru and as usual, it sucked me right in! The only thing I would say is that it seems to fall into some very predictable patterns so far, but I guess we will see what the rest brings!
B007N6EUHI|5.0|It puts the human anatomy at your finger tips! Easy, Fun and extremely useable. Great for BodyTalk students or anyone who wants to know anatomy better!
B0020PJJHS|5.0|What's not to like about this movie? It is waaay over the top. You can quote it like crazy. &#34;You can't win&#34; and &#34;She always did enjoy a good squeeze&#34;. There is a tank chase.<br /><br />Any kid who remembers playing the Goldeneye N64 game as a kid would love this movie.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Set in the 40's against yet another evil empires plot.  Ahh things were so clear back then.  I wasn't allowed to read comics so it's fun watching them on the screen.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I just can't explain it, but this CD has brought a lot of relaxing mood into my life.  So I will keep listening<br />to it round the clock until I can't stunt it anymore.  My rating will gradually diminish from love, to like, to ambivalent, to dislike, and then to hate and rage.
B007VTUYWW|5.0|Jolie carries the film of course.  and that shower scene kept me rivited.  larger than life... Laura Croft is the female James Bond but without the hail to the queen nonsense...
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Not as good as the actual book but very well made and interesting. I would have liked to see some of the costumes of the inhabitants of Capitol City.
B008GWSS6W|5.0|need I say more?  A classic film drama, cowboys, family matters, humor everything a western needs to kee you entertained.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|this was an amazing sequel. probably one of the best books I've read :)<br /> the actual hunger games was shorter than the first book but I liked this one better
B009NY43NY|2.0|After sticking with this whole series, this is a very disappointing ending.  The vampires were almost non-existent.  I thought the relationships Sookie had with them were more important than this book portrayed.
B000UGS97U|4.0|The eyes are fabric which is good because little kids probably won't pull them off, but they can get a little lost on all the fur. Overall very cute and great for mini star wars fans.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book will keep you entertained, a great continuation of the hunger games! Good for all ages ages and backgrounds,
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|For The Room to be Fireproofs first offering is amazing! The game is very well done. If you like myst games this is for you. The puzzles are quite difficult at times but not impossible and there are hints if you get stuck along the way.  I will be anxiously waiting for the next installment.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My daughter watches this again and again. There should be more movies of monster high Mattel can really go big with this set of dolls
B008Q00PHY|2.0|Was glad that the surreal mix of characters were through. Some of the special effects were good but familiar-now I know.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Always keep your eyes open.  You never know where things come from until someone does an insider's look on the situation.  Thank you Robert Kenner for doing this documentary!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I teach Japanese and show this movie to my class. It show my students a good mix of old and new cultures. The country side scenery is very nice.
B00APUQKDG|3.0|Cronenburg's work is great.<br />Pattinson's work is fantastic.  Difficult script and fantastic acting.<br />I didn't care for the story and fell asleep during this movie.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|Hard to believe that a movie consisting entirely of essentially a conversation between 2 characters could be so enthralling. But it is!
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I don't believe in buying movies without viewing them first.  This one I could have bought without watching it.  TOTALLY worth it.  I LOVED every minute of it.  I paid for the rental and then paid for it again to buy it.  I will watch it over and over again.  In fact, I think about watching it almost every day.
B00BSJ2YVA|5.0|2nd album out of Berlin, Germany--three guys with serious looking beards on the cover leave no<br />  doubt about the contents here.  This is powerful, ass-kickin' hard guitar rock with an authentic<br />  early 70s influenced, bluesy, crunchy, psychedelic style.  Trippy, burning guitar leads, a<br />  pounding, chugging rhythm section and soaring rock-star vocals combine for a killer rock `n' roll<br />  experience.  Recalls bands like Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, Black Sabbath, Leaf Hound, Lord<br />  Fowl, Free, Grand Funk Railroad, Graveyard, James Gang, U.F.O.  Tight, refreshing retro rock<br />  fun with a serious kick.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I have to keep replacing my copy of this album because I take it everywhere and/or share it with someone because its so good!
B00B9LNK5G|3.0|2nd release out of New York from singer/songwriter/orchestrator and former leader of the Czars<br />  incorporates more of an electronic bent than the debut.  Grant also adds strings, horns, piano,<br />  and percussion to these sophisticated indie pop ballads, resulting in an eclectic and somewhat<br />  uneven finish.  There are a few really good songs here, with a graceful insight into the artist's<br />  cynical take on life--but there are a lot of clunkers, too.  Sometimes recalls Richard Hawley, Iron<br />  & Wine, Harry Nilsson, Rufus Wainwright, early Elton John.
1845767055|5.0|I'm ashamed to say I'd not really looked at Paul Bonner's work before purchasing this book but gambled on it because of it's high rating and books I'd purchased in the past suggested this to me. He's a master and his work is incredible!
B00BKBCF38|3.0|2nd release from Swedish rockers--haunted, over-the-top doom-pop/demon metal that's an<br />  unlikely combination of Queen's pompous psychedelic hard rock and Bloody Hammer's<br />  doom-crush.  This is ritualistic, devil-worshiping circus metal with a theatrical flair of melody and<br />  a mysterious infatuation with arcane Satanism.  Musically, it feels a bit sillier than their<br />  impressive 2010 debut \\"Opus Eponymous\\".  Although it remains lyrically intense, the songs just<br />  aren't as compelling this time around.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Amazing book I loved the bittersweet romance and I just really enjoyed reading this book. Can't wait to read the other !
B00BYISQTO|5.0|6th release from New York band.  From the first moment, when the magical timbre of Matt<br />  Berninger's emotional baritone slur pulls at your heartstrings; you know you're listening to a new<br />  album by the National, and you're onto something special.  It doesn't have the same feel as their<br />  patently brilliant 2007 album \\"Boxer\\"; it's more similar to 2010's \\"High Violet\\"--subtle and<br />  unassuming, but easy to recognize as an exceptional piece of work.  It's not just the strength of<br />  Berninger's voice (though that is formidable); but the way everything melds seamlessly into a<br />  smooth, compellingly powerful whole.  The songs are generally soft, but you would never call<br />  them lightweight.  Lyrics are thought-provoking, soul-stirring.  The instrumentation provides an<br />  essential and solid canvas for the vocals to paint; drums & bass roll and chug along with a power<br />  that rides the edge of restraint and carries the promise of deliverance.  The music has a subtle<br />  epic ferocity/magnificence that references U2 in their prime, tempered by a dark & literate<br />  Leonard Cohen-like sense of desolation.  The depth and quality of the embracing beauty here is<br />  palpable.  This is an evening fireplace album; a stirring, reflective immersion that will<br />  occasionally cause you to pump your fist in the air.  Includes guest appearances from members<br />  of St. Vincent, Arcade Fire, Doveman, Dark Dark Dark, plus Sufjan Stevens and Sharon Van<br />  Etten.  Sometimes reminds me of bands like Dream City Film Club, Calla, the Walkmen,<br />  Tindersticks, American Music Club, Phosphorescent.  It's easy to sense that this is a work that<br />  will age very, very well.  The National is a band to treasure.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|This is kind of a review of both parts of the movie. I think that this was a superb movie with one huge, idiotic move. I don't know who did it, but the insertion of the idea that the US was engaging in a war to protect our national interest, in contrast to protecting freedom, was monumentally stupid. I would purchase the two videos on DVD but for that one line.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|it was great quality. streamed through my ps3 while hardwired through my wireless router. Great sound quality. Felt like I was using a blu ray
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this author. I've heard his name bandied about as an extreme case of atheism which could probably be dismissed for its narrowness. This is definitely not the case! His viewpoints and supporting explanations are quite cogent and really very inspiring. He has a fantastic love of life and great compassion. He SHOULD be passionate about this!
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|This is up to le Carre's usual high standard - intriuing and even disturbing.  Shades of Evelyn Waugh can be detected.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator was the easiest thing ever to download to my kindle fire. Very easy to use and fits the screen beaurifully...I am very grateful to have such a beautiful and reliable calculator for my kindle fire...I never worry as to where I might have stored my other ones because this one is always at the ready.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app.  Many free choices and different sizes to choose from.  Sure beats setting up a real puzzle!
B00CW665VI|4.0|I enjoyed this book - it was very funny. The two main characters are engaging and fun. The story is told by the man, which is unusual. I found myself snorting with laughter over many of his comments. I really recommend this book because it is very different to the usual romance stories.
B0063GORYU|1.0|i don't want to play and don't plan on it..games are not for me so there come ok ok ok
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I watched Food Inc when it was first released and it changed the way I look at food, my diet and my health. I decided to see it again recently and heard a number of things that I missed the first time around - will continue to integrate into my daily routine.
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|Five stars for special effects, maybe acting, but more importantly the special ability that I'm sure a lot of people would love to have!
B009NY43NY|4.0|While it was bitter sweet to see the series come to an end, it was time. I read a lit of mixed reviews before starting the book myself and I have to say I don't know what all the hate was about. I feel that the author stayed true to the characters and wrapped up the series neatly. SPOILER ALERT Several reviews expressed hate about the breakup up of Sookie and Eric but who didn't see that coming. I feel that the author stayed true to Eric's character. He has always looked out for himself first and foremost. This situation was not any different. There has been underlying sexual tension between Sam and Sookie for the entire series. It is fitting that in the end they would be together. The author even found a way to tie up loose ends with all the leftover Sookie haters. I enjoyed the series and the final installment is a fitting end to all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow everybody should buy this it's awesome way better than temple run good app buy it's awesome great I'm addicted to this game omg
B008KYOCA2|4.0|@Sarah (10/2011) the reason things kept doubling on you was because you had Google Calendar selected.  The same thing had happened to me.<br /><br />Got this calendar because I didn't want to have to pay for another app just to get a monthly view of a calendar or switch elsewhere for tasks.  Loved the fact that I could select the view &amp; display tasks at the same time.<br /><br />When I tried to put in birthdays to repeat yearly, they deleted from my calendar.  Will think about keeping this app.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I never watched the shield when it was live, however, because I am a huge fan of Justified, after season 4 aired I learned Walton Goggins appeared in the shield so I took the opportunity to watch it. I have never been a fan of Michael Chiklis, still am not, but Walton Goggins makes the show totally watchable. I was so happy to get to see the other side of the actor that plays Boyd Crowder. Much to my surprise this show is GOOD.  Cable was the only way this show can be watched properly. I don't think network tv could have done this show justice. A very good show, well worth watching.
B005TBWN0K|1.0|I had this once before &amp; got rid of it because I didn't understand what the purpose was.  Something told me to try again.  The map feature looked pretty neat, but that's the frustrating part...No directions on how to use this program.  Would be great to add to the Evernote collection, but I guess I am deleting it again...
B00821OX98|5.0|It streams very well.  If you like Scifi and Drama you will love this series. I would recommend it to all.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Well, I love listening to music on my android. But Ever since I got my new Audio Technica M50's, it seemed like my phone had become quieter. I decided that the phone just couldn't put out enough power to fully utilize these wonderful headphones. So I set out on a search for this exact device. I like the E5 (now called the FiiO McKinley) because of its size, and simplicity. All I needed was something to help power my headphones, and it does just that. And the built in battery is great, lasts a long time. The bass boost function is also nice, and does not distort audio. All in all, for about $20 you can't go wrong here.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I know there are a lot of movies that try to meet the quality of the book, this one was okay.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Everyone can find a part of Pitch Perfect to enjoy. It's got singing, romance, comedy and a great cast. I could watch this movie a few more times without getting tired of it.
B001O7JHSE|5.0|This is a great movie as always it cAme fast cheap and no scratches case was im good condition even though thats never a big deal to me if you dont have prime i recommend that too gotta love prime!
B004EI924E|5.0|I loved this movie from start to finish.  It got ho-hum reviews but I chalk that up to being a comic book movie and you're always going to have reviewers disappointed that it's not more like the source material.  Never reading the comics I found it a fun and well done.  All the actors are great the story is fun.  If you're a fan of any of the actors involved, this will be a good one to pick up.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I was looking for this series for a long time and every time I've got a hold of one the price was ridiculous. This is a best deal you can find.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app because I actually makes want to wake up for anything while listening to my fav music
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I love what the story is about and the plot that goes with it. I wished the books were longer and all the events were much more detailed. There also seems to be many spelling mistakes in the kindle version.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I am big history buff, but this movie put me to sleep. I honestly don't know how it ended so this review is for the first twenty minutes of the movie
145210655X|1.0|Honestly, I had hoped for a nice bedtime story to read to my sons in this book.<br /><br />The best I got from it was 3-4 laughs that were only funny because I know the movies inside and out.<br />The panels are one quick attempt at humor and no story that plays out.  Both my boys were bored beyond belief after page 3 and we had to toss it on a shelf.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|The most appealing thing about Plasma Sky are definitely the visuals. Your ship sparkles, pops, and explodes with pretty golden lights that destroy your foes. This major &#34;pro&#34; is also a little bit of a &#34;con&#34; as the pyrotechnics can distract from enemy bullets, which dissapear a little amongst the golden fury your ship constantly throws at them.<br /><br />The gameplay is typical of fly-over shooting games, but with a feel slightly reminiscent of Galaga, which gives it a nice retro feel.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes the genre, and has a bit of extra time.
0689835604|4.0|My boy learned a lot from these books. Loves the flaps. But older versions of these books has flaws: the flaps are glued to the main page by a tiny thin side. Rips of easily. If you don't mind fixing the books often, I'd recommend them.<br /><br />Also, some flaps go up, some sideways, some down. Very confusing for a toddler--which way to go? That's why they are ripped off often in my house
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I use TubeMate YouTube Downloader to download movies and TV shows to enjoy them later, to watch over and over, and it gives me something to do when I am bored and have nothing to watch.  This is why I love TubeMate YouTube Downloader!<br /><br />The easiest TV shows to download and find on YouTube are Ed Edd n Eddy and The Golden Girls, but finding movies is a bit harder, but not impossible.  To find a movie to download and watch, type in the name of the movie and then \\"full movie.\\"  Also, you can find and download movies and TV shows that are in the public domain, especially movies with the Gish sisters (Lillian and Dorothy).<br /><br />A few pieces of information for the potential downloader: Do not upload and download any videos that violate the YouTube community guidelines, this app does not have porn ads, and think before you download!<br /><br />*****Note: TubeMate is also great for long bus and car rides, and for downtime anytime, especially at night and on the weekends!*****
B00021HBGS|5.0|One year later my boy still plays with these. We first bought Alex beep a string with the same types of vehicles. Now he loves these. I do separate them into two sets though--too many for one bath time. He has a road and half the vehicles to play with. I switch them every other week
B009LHWEKW|5.0|This show is addictive and glad they have signed on to do Seasons 9 and possibly 10!  Best show on TV
B0064W65SO|4.0|I loved reading this. It deserves 5 stars, but on the kindle edition, the pages after the story should be divided into two pages each because they are too small to read even on the 8.9\\" screen.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I mean it is Jimi Hendrix.  What is there not to love?  Right?  Anything new is a good thing and I love it.
B005NAE04E|4.0|Hey this books was awesome and different! really interesting character and storyline, a bit harry potter-esk which i loved! can't wait to read his latest novel
B004ZY0VHY|2.0|I would not recommend this book.  It was difficult to read because everything is so negative.  It was hard to be sympathetic to any of the characters.  Don't bother with this one.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|thought it was going to be good. but my son is very imaginative and he doesn't know how to spell<br /> so he tryed to type in throne and it was spelled thron<br /> the game switched it to thong. now that's all he says. and it corrected it to something else(if u know what I mean)
B008Y78M60|5.0|My wife is a Lincoln nut. SHe followe3d every bit of the film even with one of her books on Lincoln in her lap.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Great, short form book on the \\"idea\\" of genuis and concepts of imagination.  Also gives a great account of what Tesla did for us, living in the 21st century and how \\" genius\\" of its time can come across as \\"crazy\\" to people, because humans have an inate fear of the unknown. Highly recommend!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Loved every minute of this book...never got bored with any part of it.<br />Such a sad but beautiful ending...a box of tissues needed for the end.<br />Really opens your eyes on the suffering of the severely disabled.
B006YC74E8|5.0|It works really well with the Kindle Fire HD camera, &amp; can improve the quality of your pictures! It was really worth downloading.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I will miss this series! I didn't want it to end. I'm so proud of my fellow Arkansan, Charlaine Harris- what a genuine talent. This series & this particular novel was sheer pleasure from start to finish!  Charlaine: Mmmmmwahhhhhhh!
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|I love this show, and wanted to see it from the start. Great one liners, and all the people in the show are wonderful
B0090EJ99A|5.0|When you need a certain level of crude humor... many steps above fart o vomit jokes you can rely on Sacha Baron Cohen to really deliver the belly laughs.<br /><br />If you have any sensibilities park them at the door and enter.....
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The main character development in the story evokes many emotions in the reader and makes it a very compelling read.  I LOVED the book!.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Definitely a great movie hands down. If your looking for a romantic movie to watch, Nicolas Sparks will never fail you! Plus, the main characters in this movie are VERY attractive.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|An intriguing and at times mesmerizing read filled with creativity and imagination.  At times a bit scattered, but entertaining still.
B00005U8EM|5.0|The item came and was in great condition. no scratches or other damages. played well I would definitely use them again.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Interesting fantastical look into magical realities. Matrix like opportunities to look at one's life and how one can make the impossible possible.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun like alot, action pack alot of different levels and will tell others, thank you for it
1452110581|5.0|Hilariously written. I got it for my friend's birthday and she absolutely loved it. She is a big cat person and this definitely tickled her fancy.
B002V092M4|4.0|Many people say that Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a hard book to read. If by that they mean it has no fast cars, no explosions, no sexy female characters, no gadgets, and no suave main character, then yes, they are right.<br /><br />Tinker Tailor is a different sort of book. It IS a page turner, and it has heaps of action and suspense for the deeper reader. It is incredibly tense and riveting, and there is an almost Bondian quality about the back story given to the characters. Le Carr&eacute; (once a spy himself) paints a foggy, dimly-lit, cynical, intense, and convoluted puzzle of paranoia, suspicion, intrigue, betrayal, and espionage.<br /><br />His characters - Smiley, Haydon, Alleline, Control, Karla - are all memorable and fully fleshed, so much so that the reader will be doubting his/her own suspicions and wondering who to trust. They move about in a tired, cynical way, as if they were too old to care anymore. Like all good spy novels, Tinker Tailor has it's own jargon, but unlike the romantic Double-O Seven's and Treadstone's, this jargon is darker: Operation Witchcraft, the Circus, scalp-hunters, lamp lighters, wranglers, and moles. Interestingly, according to le Carr&eacute;, MI6 has actually adopted some of these phrases into their every day craft!<br /><br />Tinker Tailor paints the most accurate portrayal of spying and the Cold War that I have ever read. Leave it to le Carr&eacute;! There are actually more similarities with Bond then some realize. The exotic locales are present in the form of Moscow and even North Africa, the gadgets are present in bugs, recording devices, and hidden cameras, and the sexy female character is present in Irina - a Russian defector of questionable motive. But spying is far different then that.<br />Smiley's investigating takes place in conversations, bugged recordings, telephone calls, file readings, and mind games. But these are just as riveting as a car chase or a fight scene.<br /><br />The setting is also wonderfully atmospheric, with le Carr&eacute;'s elegant prose conjuring up smoky halls, rainy, dimly-lit roads, tired safe houses, suburban flats, and misty moors.<br /><br />This is the type of book that Tinker Tailor is. Perhaps it is not as action-packed or page-turnable as a Fleming or Ludlum thriller, but Tinker Tailor rewards the patient viewer with a riveting, convoluted mystery plot, numerous red herrings, memorable, realistic characters, an accurate depiction of real-world espionage, suspicion, paranoia, mis-trust, betrayal, double and triple agents, suspense, and a twist ending so shocking you might just have to read the book again.<br /><br />Strongly Recommended! 4.5 Stars!<br /><br />P.S. Also recommended:<br />1. [[ASIN:0143121421 The Spy Who Came in from the Cold: A George Smiley Novel]]- Arguably, the best spy story ever written. See my review.<br />2. [[ASIN:B005DXCO94 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]] - The best adaptation of Tinker Tailor, with the incomparable Alec Guinness as George Smiley.<br />[[ASIN:B0079LJZG8 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]] - A brilliant, if dense and slowly paced cinematic adaptation, with an incredible cast and beautiful cinematography.Carré's elegant prose conjuring up smoky halls, rainy, dimly-lit roads, tired safe houses, suburban flats, and misty moors.<br /><br />This is the type of book that Tinker Tailor is.

B000FBJAEG|5.0|Could not guess the ending<br />Great team Sean and Michelle look forward to the next book<br />Great read on a plane, really killed the boredom
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This app is super cute,some of the levels are tough but not overly so. I like this app alot if you like the first two apps before this one, then you will love this one
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love anything on here. The dresses are flattering and I really love the part where I wash her hair  because it is beautiful and interesting . I love you all
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I was impressed by the quality of this cable. Very well made. But after I received it I returned it. MT mistake. Wrong cable ordered!<br /><br />But if this is what yon need you can not go wrong!
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Using this more often than I thought I would. My only problem with this app is that you just about need to know how to spell the word correctly before you can find it...which to me defeats the purpose.
B000000XB9|5.0|One of the greatest Rock Bands ever.<br />One of the greatest CD's in my collection of over 300.<br />Every song is a hit!  I can't stop listening to it.<br />Go ahead and buy it.  If you don't love it, I will pay for it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Finally got this app to work exactly the way I like. Just wish it would remember my email address so I wouldn't have to type the whole thing in each time.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Sookie Stackhouse has become one of my fondest guilty pleasures, her resilience and down-to -earth nature has delighted me to no end. Sad to see her story end but happy with how Ms. Harris left it- with a future of strength ahead. Loved it and have reread it and surely will keep it as a favorite.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I rarely watch TV series but this series are really good. Jonathan played really well as King Henry VIII. The settings are beautiful too.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|It is such an addictive game, well designed and the playing options are great, can not stop playing it, it's a must, download it asap!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This classic is a wonderful touching story of four girls growing up in difficult circumstances.  It is old fashioned and sweet.
B002KYGLVQ|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time! Outstanding performances by Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman! Everyone should see this movie!
B009AZZEU2|4.0|Like other reviews have noted this is similar to their last two albums before they broke up, yet still progressing a little from their core sound.  In this tv singer competition era, Soundgarden's comeback is a welcome treat for young and old rock fans.  The &#34;definitive&#34; grunge band show they are still relevant in today's music world and have crafted an album that stands up to the rest of their catalog.  Let's hope they can continue creating the music we love and have some fun while doing it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. it is a great app with lots of interesting things on it. I am addicted to it
B007JMW46U|5.0|These are timeless stories.  The familiar characters of Holmes and Dr Watson are introduced simply and effectively.  They are classics that set the direction of crime writing for years to come.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I love Pretty Little Liars. It is my favorite show. You should def buy this so you can watch old episodes
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I started to read this book in Portugues, my first language, and on paper. As I had to travel, I bought the kindle book and continued the reading. There are 900 pages of a wonderful narrative. It's a historic novel, but we &#34;forget&#34; what really happen and we begin wishing the war doesn't happen, even if we know it happened! Furthermore, we learn a lot of what occured last century! I strongly recommend it!
B00866JL96|5.0|Great movie. I really liked that. Nicolas Sparks is a great author and the movie is just as good. buy it!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This is sooooo dumb!  I was looking for a challenge and this is not what I got.  A baby could figure this one out
B00A83075M|5.0|Great movie. One of my favorites. Good for any age! Great gift and it is really cute with a good message
B000SEIK2S|5.0|John Scalzi has an exceptional ability to develop the characters in his books and brings just enough detail about who and where they are and some of their motivations - just enough to keep a good reading pace.  &#34;Old Man's War&#34; has elements and themes that are like a mashup of classic Sci Fi movies including Avatar, Blade Runner, and (I hate to say it, but...) Starship Troopers, all within a very plausible and mature universe.
B005LAIGTG|5.0|good movie. I liked the book. good deal and worth the money for sure.<br />One of the best movies ever.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Being a woman who just turned 30, is getting married this year, is planning on having kids, and is happy with her career in management, this book was a timely read for me.  Many of Sandberg's points were valid and inspiring.  I don't think her ideas will apply to everyone - not every woman wants to lead or has circumstances that allow her to - but Sanberg does attempt to be understanding of this issue.  I would recommend this book for any woman who is comtemplating choices about how to divide her time between work and family.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I bought this book because I had already seen the movie and thought that it would be a great addition to my library, but WOW! The movie did this book no justice! I related to Charlie on so many levels, and came to realize that there is a little of him in all of us. READ THIS BOOK!!!
B001BKTEZA|4.0|Great book.  Explains the real life experiences of the people who tried to make an escape from the miserable hardscrabble life they were living in the dust ridden Midwest.  Made me really understand the horrible conditions and treatment these people endured.
B00932A4XE|3.0|This was a lighthearted romantic comedy that could've been better but still watchable.  Very predictable storyline but at least it had a satisfying ending.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Have always enjoyed these series of books with Harry Bosch!  Always very suspenseful to the end. Will continue to follow Harry.
0375836675|5.0|After reading &#34;The Book Thief&#34;, I was in awe of Markus Zusak as an author.  So it was with optimism, mixed with trepidation, that I read &#34;I Am The Messenger&#34;.  Can he equal &#34;The Book Thief&#34;?  I wondered.  Well, I soon discovered this book stands alone as a good read.<br /><br />While a bit darker in its overall tone, it flows with the ability to shine light on dark places and is very funny in places.  It left me with the poignant reminder that I am not only the messenger, but how I live my life is the message.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Too many ads.<br />You can't see the full picture to know which direction to start.<br />I will be removing this game.
B001974DG0|5.0|I love this book it was my first suspense novel at the age of 13 and I can honestly say as I read it again at the age of 24 it is still the best story I have read to date.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My children love the different fish and the reef itself. This is a great game for passing the time. I suggest this app to all mothers.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I am terrible with fractions,I think they came from hell. This app puts my mind at ease when I see the little buggers coming.
B00005JPO1|3.0|I was very afraid of this happening. I absolutely love the other 3, even the temple of doom which some didn't care for because of the some of the subject matter and gross out dinner scene but I loved all of them. Until, this one that is. I remember watching it in the theater shaking my head. It wasn't the same great story. It was cartoony with some characters and how some things evolved made no sense. I loved Marian and always thought indy and her should have got back together, I actually liked shai labeouf as the kid believe it or not, he pulled off what was a mostly uncreative script. There are some creepy moments but nothing scary, not one bit. there was always a scene that scared the crap outta me in each movie especially raiders with the arch being opened. And i hated how the scenes with Marian played out with her and indy fighting (very sad writing guys) and then making up (so cliche). I think they waited too long to do the last movie. why do it if it isn't going to match the originals.<br />  Recently, I had the urge to watch it again. It was the same movie, but I don't classify it with the other indy movies. There was a dry period, a lull in movies and I realized that Spielberg's bad movie looked like a gem compared to the crap that they shovel out these days. So I watched it again and wasn't as horrified, but I will never make the mistake of classifying it with or watching it after the other movies. I honestly think, if they would have spent more time actually developing the story with a great screen writer it could have been much better.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The room, while short, is very well conceived and I look forward to many rooms to come.  It has the power to stump.
B0094M2ITG|5.0|I am a huge fan of Tim Burton, and this movie was no exception.  It was touching and exciting, with just enough fantasy element to keep it light.  Superb acting by the leads in the movie, and an amazing storyline, made this one of my favorites.
B008645YH6|5.0|It's rare that I find an album that I can just press play and listen to all the tracks without skipping them. I've liked her music in the past, but I'm so glad that I bought this album! I admit that I test drive the songs on YouTube prior to purchasing, so I more or less knew what I was getting into.
